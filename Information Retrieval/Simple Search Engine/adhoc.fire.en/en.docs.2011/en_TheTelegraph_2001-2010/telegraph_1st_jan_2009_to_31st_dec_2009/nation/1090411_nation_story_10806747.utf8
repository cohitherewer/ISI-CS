	Raipur, April 10 (PTI): Ten CRPF personnel, including a deputy commandant, were killed and 11 jawans injured in a fierce encounter with Naxalites in Dantewada district of Chhattisgarh.         
	The attack comes less than a week before the Lok Sabha elections here on April 16.         
	Troops of the 55th battalion walked into a Naxalite ambush deep in the forests of Kotampalli in Dantewada while they were on a patrol.        
	Three suspected Naxalites were killed in the gunbattle.        
	An AK-47 rifle and a few wireless sets have been recovered from the site, a CRPF officer said.        
	Dantewada superintendent of police Rahul Sharma said the Naxalites attacked the patrol unit near Minta village, about 200km from the district headquarters.        
	A team of CRPF officials has reached the site to find out if the Naxalites used landmines or surprise gunfire on the patrolling party.        
	The injured have been airlifted to the Jagdalpur district hospital.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lashkar eye on Calcutta
                                                                                                               Lashkar eye on Calcutta
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 6: The home ministry has warned of Lashkar strikes on Calcutta, Delhi and Hyderabad around Independence Day.        
	In Bengal, where the government is preoccupied with the Maoist trouble and political clashes, terrorists could use the opportunity to foment trouble in Calcutta, sources in the ministry said.        
	The city remains on the terror hit list, with inputs every other month about it being a corridor or a meeting spot for Lashkar operatives, the sources said.        
	Last year, an alleged attempt by jihadi groups to create trouble in the city was foiled, though the plot wasnt related to Independence Day.        
	Of the three cities, the threat to Hyderabad, which had witnessed two blasts in quick succession in 2007, is said to be the greatest.         
	Hyderabad is hosting the badminton world championship from August 10 to 16, the first time the tournament will be played in India. Over 325 players and officials from 45 countries are expected to participate. We are awake to the threat, a senior police official said from Hyderabad.         
	In Delhi, a security blanket will envelop the Red Fort, from whose ramparts Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will address the nation. Union home secretary G.K. Pillai today held meetings with officials to review the I-Day threat.        
	Delhi police tonight arrested two suspected Hizb-ul militants allegedly planning attacks ahead of August 15.

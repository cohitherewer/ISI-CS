	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 8: A day after chief minister Naveen Pattnaik stressed on the need for a swine flu awareness drive, the H1N1 virus penetrated even more into the district.        
	The deadly virus reared its ugly head again in Sundergarh with two more students testing positive, taking the number of patients to 18 across the state.         
	The two students aged 12 and 15 years, respectively, belong to Jawahar Nabodaya Vidyalaya in Sargipalli area of the district.        
	Their swabs were sent to Regional Medical Research Centre in Bhubaneswar after they showed flu-like symptoms. Sixteen other students of the Vidyalaya are also ill with fever, which has spread panic in the region.        
	Earlier, five girls of a kanyashram at Jhanipalli under Rajgangpur block area tested positive for H1N1 while two more from nearby Tudalaga school were also affected. A medical team has rushed to Sargipalli region to contain the situation.

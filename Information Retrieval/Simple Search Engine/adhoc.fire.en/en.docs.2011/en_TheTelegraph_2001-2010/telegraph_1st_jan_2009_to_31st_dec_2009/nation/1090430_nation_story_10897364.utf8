The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | roll of Modis DICE   Sectarian surgeon switches to social engineering
                                                                                                               Roll of Modis dice 
  Sectarian surgeon switches to social engineering          SANKARSHAN THAKUR IN GANDHINAGAR                          Modi: Megalomaniac?                                        
	The Congress has sprung an unlikely student in Gujarat. He goes by the name of Narendra Modi, and he is making a controversial grab for the social umbrella the Congress once possessed.         
	In a radical experiment ridden with risks, the countrys most watched chief minister has switched from his notorious sectarian surgery to social engineering methods effected profitably by Congress leaders in the 1980s.         
	Many see in Modis ticket distribution an evident bid to craft a new caste alliance on the lines of the late Jinabhai Darjis invincible coalition of Kshatriyas, Harijans, Adivasis and Muslims (KHAM) that repeatedly delivered huge majorities to the Congress. But, equally, they believe that the strategy could come a cropper in these elections.         
	The reasons are several and apparent.         
	Its an untested gamble in the middle of a critical election. These are not castes or groups traditionally loyal to the BJP and they are being wooed at the expense of the socially influential and economically formidable Patels, whose revolt against the party is not limited anymore to anti-Advani ire in Gandhinagar.         
	Several of those entrusted with the task of assembling this new league behind Modi are discredited and discarded Congressmen. Somji Damor (Adivasi) of Dahod and Bhausinh Rathod (OBC Rajput) of Patan are prime examples  the former is a bootlegger who many think politically spent, the latter an alleged narcotics peddler whose son is serving jail.         
	But most important of all, Muslims are missing from Modis coalition-in-making; its they who gave critical mass to KHAM. Its a mad scheme, especially because we have left our loyal Patels angry, admits a senior state BJP leader. But who can tell Modi, and who knows with him? He may just be able to swing it by sheer force of personality.         
	Political analyst Achyut Yagnik, who has seen many caste alliances built and broken over the last four decades, isnt so sure. Modi is trying to make this a lamp-post election, he believes anyone who has his ticket is a winner. It will not work like that because this is not a Modi-centric election, he is not up for office in this election.         
	Besides, Muslims and to a great extent even Adivasis are strongly with the Congress. Modis personality is not enough to shake up old social alliances in any significant way.         
	Modi has given away as many as 18 of the states 26 tickets to caste groups that are not traditionally BJP votaries; six of them are reserved seats, of course, but in several among the remaining 12 constituencies, Patel claims have been gruffly ignored to favour OBC communities. This may earn Modi and the BJP diminished returns from both ends.         
	As one BJP leader upset with the ticket distribution put it: It is not clear whether the OBC groups and Adivasis are turning to us, the Muslim vote we wont get, and the Patels are certainly very angry, as is evident from the big campaign they have launched against Advaniji in Gandhinagar.         
	Gujarat Congress bigwig Narhari Amin, himself a caste Patel, sounds pleased as Punch with what he calls Modis half-baked caste khichdi. Recalling his own partys past follies, Amin says: Modi is committing the same mistake that Congress suffered for. He thinks he has become the proprietor of Gujarat, he is intoxicated on his own prowess, he is making a big mistake by ignoring Patels.         
	According to Amin, the humiliation of Patels by Modi began much ahead of the Lok Sabha elections. Six months ago, Nattaji Thakur, an OBC, was chosen to fill a Rajya Sabha vacancy. Then another OBC Thakur, Kanaji Thakur, was made mayor of Ahmedabad.        
	Patels had claims on both positions but were ignored, and now that they have suffered in ticket distribution, they are recalling these two incidents and convincing themselves that Modi has turned against them. The Congress had made the mistake of ignoring Patels and Madhavsinh Solankis government fell in 1990 primarily on that count. Now Modi has chosen that path, good for us.         
	Its anybodys guess how much Patel disgruntlement will hurt the BJP and help the Congress statewide, but the swell of anger against Modi is visible.         
	In the Saurashtra region, for instance, veteran BJP leader and former MP A.K. Patel (he was one of only two BJP MPs elected to the Lok Sabha in the Congress landslide of 1984) is openly canvassing for Congressmen. BJP sources also tell you that loyalists of the sidelined former chief minister, Keshubhai Patel, are also spurring Patel resentment against Modi.         
	Modi has left Patels seething by ignoring their claims in more than half a dozen seats, said the BJP leader. On the other hand, the Congress has played its Patel card well. It has given tickets to six Patels and also recently elevated Siddharth Patel, son of Chimanbhai, to presidentship of the state unit. There are clear signs the Patels are turning to the Congress in a big way.         
	Why would Modi, who is fashioning himself as future Prime Minister and needs to re-emphasise his stranglehold over Gujarat in these elections, would gamble in such fashion, though? The answers vary depending on who you ask.         
	Non-partisan Modi-watchers would put it down to the mans convictions of supremacy. He is egotistical to the extreme, says historian Tridib Suhrud. And he may genuinely believe Gujarat will vote for anybody he picks up and throws at the electorate. He is not bothered about the partys fortunes, he is bothered about creating a loyal cadre of his own. To rob veteran Kanshiram Rana of the Surat Lok Sabha ticket and hand it to a municipal-level rookie like Darshana Jardosh illustrates that.         
	But conspiracy theorists even within the BJP have another take. Modi is taking a gamble that cant hurt him this time, they tell you. His eyes are on 2014, says one minister in the Modi cabinet. He could not care less if he can offer the numbers to Advani in this election, this is not Modis hour. Frankly, he is quite happy having a non-BJP government installed at the Centre because anti-incumbency will help his bid for power in the next election. Meantime, if he can stitch up a new social base and have loyalists around him, the tactic would have paid off.         
	A little too conspiratorial, you might think, but then the unfolding Advani-Modi attrition lends weight to it. Advani has paid little heed to the recent clamour for Modi as prime ministerial candidate in 2014 and stodgily refused to endorse his succession claims at a news conference here on Tuesday. Modi isnt above wanting to pay him back with a rotten coin.        
	 Gandhinagar votes on April 30

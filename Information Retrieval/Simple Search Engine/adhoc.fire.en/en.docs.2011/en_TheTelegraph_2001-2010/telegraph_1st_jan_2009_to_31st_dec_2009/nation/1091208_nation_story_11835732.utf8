The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | New job hope in Rajnath refrain 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      New job hope in Rajnath refrain 
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 7: For 14 years, Rajnath Singh tried to cosy up to the RSS and finally succeeded when he was anointed BJP chief in 2005.         
	The RSSs mandate was clear: furious with L.K. Advani for betraying the paterfamilias with his praise of Mohammed Ali Jinnah, it expected Rajnath to erase the veterans footprints on the BJP by purging it of his loyalists.        
	Too diffident to execute the brief, Rajnath did a balancing act: retained some Advanis proteges and offloaded or sidelined others. Not for long, though. The Advani followers manoeuvred themselves back into positions of strength.        
	So today, when Rajnath opened the debate for the BJP on the Liberhan Commission report his first speech in his first term in the Lok Sabha  he defended the RSS and its front organisations, triggering speculation about a larger agenda at work.        
	Rajnaths acolytes believe he should be made the Opposition leader in the Lok Sabha once Advani demits the post. They claim the takeover by Sushma Swaraj, widely tipped to succeed Advani in the job, will not be as automatic as is being made out to be.         
	Rajnaths loyalists, who fear they will lose their standing once his term expires at the end of this month, are spreading the word that the B factor will come in Sushmas way.         
	Their point is that with two Brahmins heading or likely to head two important arms of the BJP  Arun Jaitley as Opposition leader in the Rajya Sabha and Nitin Gadkari as likely party chief  they cannot afford to have a third Brahmin in, Sushma.        
	Besides, we need a face from the Hindi heartland, Uttar Pradesh to the point, an aide of Rajnath said. Sushma is from Haryana, Rajnath from Uttar Pradesh.         
	In his speech, Rajnath recorded his umbrage at the Liberhan commission referring to late RSS leader Morapant Pingle  believed to have conceived the Ayodhya movement as a Shiv Sainik and to the RSS as a political party.        
	As education minister in Uttar Pradeshs BJP government in the early 90s, Rajnath had ordered history books to be recast so that they reflected the RSSs version of major events.

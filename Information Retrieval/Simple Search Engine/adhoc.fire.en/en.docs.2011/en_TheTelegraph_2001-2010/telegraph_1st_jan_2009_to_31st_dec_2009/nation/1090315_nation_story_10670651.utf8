The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Talaaq for Fiza
                                                                                                               Talaaq for Fiza
                            
	Chandigarh, March 14: Chander Mohan, the former Haryana deputy chief minister whose protracted marital tiff with his second wife was on prime time television for months, yesterday pronounced talaaq thrice over the phone.        
	Chand called me up last night and also sent me an SMS with the same message, Fiza, the second wife, said today.         
	He spoke to me briefly and was very impolite while offering me compensation of Rs 5 lakh which I refused to accept. He also threatened me with dire consequences if I pursued the matter further, Fiza claimed.        
	Both had disappeared last November to resurface as a married couple after embracing Islam and changing their names.

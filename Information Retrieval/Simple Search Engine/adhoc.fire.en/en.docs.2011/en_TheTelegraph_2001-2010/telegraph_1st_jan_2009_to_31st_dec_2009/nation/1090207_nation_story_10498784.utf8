The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pub probe exposes womens panel rift
                                                                                                               Pub probe exposes womens panel rift
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 6: The National Commission for Women has rejected its own probe into the assault on women at a Mangalore pub after comments made by the member who conducted the inquiry were criticised by Union minister Renuka Chowdhury.         
	But in rejecting the report submitted by commission member Nirmala Venkatesh, the NCW may have exposed fissures within Indias top womens panel.         
	NCW chairperson Girija Vyas criticised Venkateshs report for failing to focus adequately on the accounts of the victims of the assault by activists of the Sri Ram Sena on January 24.         
	Instead of going into why the pub was targeted, the report should have focused on the women harassed in the episode, Vyas told reporters here today, after rejecting Venkateshs report at an internal meeting.         
	Venkatesh, who visited Mangalore after the attack, spoke to a television channel while she was still inquiring into the case, which NCW officials close to Vyas say amounts to a violation of commission norms.         
	Her comments on television also fetched Venkatesh criticism from women and child development minister Chowdhury, who yesterday issued her a show cause notice. Venkatesh has to respond by Monday.         
	Venkatesh had told the channel that while the Ram Sena was to blame for the attacks, the pub owner too was responsible as he had failed to provide adequate security. She is also alleged to have said the women were wearing inappropriate clothes.         
	Today, Venkatesh defended her report, calling the telecast of her comments selective. Why should I resign? I have not done anything wrong, she said.         
	But sources close to Venkatesh suggested the now open rift within the NCW has been brewing for at least a month.         
	The tiff, the sources said, started when the NCW received corruption complaints against an IAS officer deputed to the commission on administrative duties.         
	In December 2008, a majority of NCW members, including Venkatesh, asked Vyas to remove the IAS officer.         
	But Vyas refused, sparking a war of words between the NCW chairperson and Venkatesh.         
	Sources close to Vyas confirmed the incident, and admitted that relations between the two women  both belonging to the Congress  have been tense since Venkatesh, it is learnt, is keen on receiving a Congress ticket from Bangalore in the coming Lok Sabha polls. Sources close to her suggested that her comments could be linked to the image she hopes to cultivate before the elections.

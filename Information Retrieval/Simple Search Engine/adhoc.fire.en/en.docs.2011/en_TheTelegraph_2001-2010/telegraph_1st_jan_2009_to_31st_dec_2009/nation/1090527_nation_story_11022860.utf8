          SUBRAT DAS                              
	Bhubaneswar, May 26: Election of a non-tribal as the Congress legislature party leader has sparked resentment among tribal and Dalit legislators in the main Opposition party in the Assembly.        
	Out of 27 party MLAs elected this time, 14 belong to the tribal and Dalit communities. Several senior tribal leaders, including former minister and six-time MLA Dambarudhar Ulaka and seven-time legislator Basudev Majhi, have been re-elected to the Assembly this time. As Majhi has not been keeping well since long, Ulaka was expected to be elected as the Congress legislature party leader.        
	As Congress is the single largest Opposition party in the Assembly, its leader will be conferred the post of Leader of the Opposition, which carries the status of a cabinet minister. However, a non-tribal leader Bhupinder Singh was elected as Congress legislature party leader, ignoring the claims of Ulaka and other senior tribal and Dalit leaders, alleged a tribal legislator of the party on condition of anonymity. The tribal and Dalit communities have thrown their support to the Congress, which suffered serious debacle in the coastal belt. But the party has taken them for granted, he rued.         
	However, defending the election, a state spokesperson said: Singh has been elected to the Assembly four times and served as a cabinet minister twice.        
	Two other posts in Congress legislature party  chief whip and secretary  have also gone to non-tribals. While Prasad Harichandan, a non-tribal leader from Puri district, has been elected as the chief whip, Anup Sai was chosen as its secretary.        
	On the other hand, Chakradhar Paik, a tribal legislator elected for the first time, has been elected as the deputy leader of the Congress legislature party. The tribal and Dalit legislators dubbed Paiks post as a consolation prize.         
	Not a single Dalit legislator has been given any post in the Congress legislature party.

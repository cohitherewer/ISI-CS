                                                                                                               Jail term in law against ragging
                            
	Shimla, Aug. 17 (PTI): Students held guilty of ragging and heads of educational institutions found abetting the offence will be jailed under a law passed by the Himachal Pradesh Assembly today.        
	The law has been passed more than five months after the death of a college student because of ragging.        
	According to the new law, a person indulging in ragging can be imprisoned for up to three years or/and fined up to Rs 50,000.        
	It also envisages punishment of up to two years in jail and fine up to Rs 25,000 for the head or an officer directly or primarily in charge of maintenance of discipline if the institution knowingly fails to check the menace. Students convicted will be expelled and will not be admitted elsewhere for three years from the date of the order of expulsion.

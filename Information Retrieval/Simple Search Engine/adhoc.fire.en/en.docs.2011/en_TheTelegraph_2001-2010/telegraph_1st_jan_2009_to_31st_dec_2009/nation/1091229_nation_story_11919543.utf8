The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Gift after Dadri blows
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Gift after Dadri blows
          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                              
	Lucknow, Dec. 28: Anil Ambanis Reliance Power today gave Uttar Pradesh a birthday gift, starting production at a plant that will cut the states power deficit and help the company salvage its image after the Dadri project setbacks.        
	The company today commissioned the first 300MW unit at its Rosa power project  north Indias first private thermal power station  on the birth anniversary of Dhirubhai Ambani. The 1,200MW project is coming up on 1,500 acres at Shahjahanpur, about 160km west of Lucknow.        
	It will start operations in two stages, each producing 600MW. Generation of 300MW commenced today, while another 300MW plant would start within the next few days, Reliance Power CEO J.P. Chalasani said.        
	Company officials have been deeply worried after Allahabad High Court dealt a further blow to the jinxed gas-based Dadri power project this month, partly quashing the land acquisition order. The 7,800MW project had earlier provoked a farmers land agitation before getting enmeshed in a Supreme Court battle with Mukesh Ambanis company over the supply of natural gas.        
	Today Reliance Power officials reaffirmed the companys commitment to the Dadri project. Chalasani said the project was still on and we would implement (it) without violating the court order.        
	We are happy that at least one project is complete, and this shows our sincerity in improving the power situation in Uttar Pradesh, a senior company official said. This is a birth anniversary gift from the company to Uttar Pradesh. The move comes at a welcome time when the gap between demand and supply in the state has reached about 1,800MW. The development prompted the Samajwadi Party to claim credit.        
	We are happy the Rosa project was signed during Mulayam Singh Yadavs tenure as chief minister, Mulayams son Akhilesh said.        
	The project was originally signed by the AV Birla Group, which later lost interest. In 2005, it was revived and handed over to Anil Ambanis company.        
	A power purchase pact has been signed with the state electricity board. Phase I will supply power to neighbouring villages and Phase II will cater to the needs of other states, officials said.        
	Only about 56 per cent of Uttar Pradesh villages are said to have electricity. This plant will help a lot of villagers in the vicinity to power their water pump sets, project chief Ganesan Amudhan said.

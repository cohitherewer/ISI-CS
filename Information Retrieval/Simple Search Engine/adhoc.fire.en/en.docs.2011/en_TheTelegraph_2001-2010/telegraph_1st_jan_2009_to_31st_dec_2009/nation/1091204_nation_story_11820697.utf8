          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Dec. 3: After his night halts at Dalit homes, Rahul Gandhi will now mount a more direct challenge to Mayavatis key vote bank by wooing Dalit youths at a rally on her citadel of Ambedkarnagar.        
	Rahul will meet 25 Dalit youth leaders and address a public meeting on December 8 in the district, 230km from here, which epitomises Mayavatis Dalit vote bank and from where she has personally contested several Assembly and Lok Sabha polls.        
	The Congress general secretary will visit Uttar Pradesh on December 7-8 to woo youths and minorities and strengthen the party organisation, state Congress president Rita Bahuguna Joshi said.        
	Congress sources said 25 young Dalit leaders from Ambedkarnagar had already agreed to work with Rahul. They will meet the Amethi MP and pledge to help the Congress in its development efforts.        
	This is a new breed of Dalit youngster who refuses to be swayed by (Mayavatis) politics of memorials and parks, a state Congress leader said.        
	Ambedkarnagar used to be known as Akbarpur till 1995 before Mayavati became chief minister, separated it from Faizabad district and renamed it after Dalit icon B.R. Ambedkar. Some 45 per cent of voters in the district  one of the most backward in eastern Uttar Pradesh  are Dalits or backward castes.        
	Its also the birthplace of socialist leader Ram Manohar Lohia and, since the 1980s, been a hotbed of Dalit and backward-caste politics.        
	It remains to be seen how the constituency, polarised always on caste lines, reacts to Rahuls model of development politics, a Congress leader from Ambedkarnagar said.        
	In the early 1990s, all five Assembly seats in the district were in the Bahujan Samaj Party kitty. The BSP conceded some ground to the Samajwadi Party in the 1996 and 2002 Assembly polls, but in 2007 it swept all the five seats again.        
	Mayavati had last contested from the district in the 2004 Lok Sabha polls --- she is now a member of the state legislative council.

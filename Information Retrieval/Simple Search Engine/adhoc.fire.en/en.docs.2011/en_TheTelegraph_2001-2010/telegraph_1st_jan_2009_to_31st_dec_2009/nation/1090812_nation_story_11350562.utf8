The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Jaya out, parties vie for MGR slice
                                                                                                               Jaya out, parties vie for MGR slice
          G.C. SHEKHAR                          MG Ramachandran                                  
	Chennai, Aug. 11: The biggest vote-catcher is from a party that is not even contesting the polls. The man himself is not even alive. And if all thats not surprising enough, parties from the Left to the BJP are claiming him as their own.        
	The August 18 bypolls in Tamil Nadu seem to be all about M.G. Ramachandran. And the reason, paradoxically, is that the party he founded, the ADMK, is boycotting the elections to the five Assembly constituencies.        
	Opposition parties including the Left, BJP, actor Vijayakanths DMDK and a host of Independents are all invoking the former actor-chief ministers name and claiming a piece of his legacy.        
	Their intention is to milk his appeal to woo the pro-ADMK voters, hoping they would ignore party chief Jayalalithaas call not to vote.        
	Smiling pictures of MGR in his signature fur cap and dark glasses, and songs from his old films, are evoking memories of the times when the states first actor-chief minister called the shots from 1977 to 1987.        
	With the ADMK relying more and more on Jayalalithaas larger-than-life image for its election campaigns, MGR had been relegated to the background. Contestants hoping to woo his die-hard supporters are now rediscovering the MGR mantra, a former ADMK minister said.        
	For example, the campaign of P. Chinnaswamy, the BJP candidate from Thondamuthur near Coimbatore, is dominated by MGRs images rather than those of any BJP leader. Chinnaswamy had twice been elected as an ADMK MLA during the MGR era.        
	His logic is: I came to politics because of MGR and voters here know me as a former ADMK man. Since the party is not in the fray, I am only urging its supporters to ensure that their votes are polled by an MGR loyalist and not by other pretenders.        
	The Independents too have conveniently turned MGR fans. M. Krishnakumar, contesting the same Thondamuthur seat, is distributing pamphlets proclaiming himself the candidate with MGRs blessings.        
	Since his election symbol is two candles, he has printed posters showing MGR holding two candles (thanks to computer graphics).        
	Even the Left parties are unwilling to let go of the MGR vote, unmindful of the ADMKs disapproval of their candidates contesting four of the five seats.        
	We supported many of MGRs political struggles and were his allies on many occasions. So his followers should vote for our nominees, CPI state secretary D. Pandian pleaded at an election rally in Srivakuntam.        
	The ADMK can only watch helplessly. In retrospect, it was a mistake to boycott these elections since everyone wants to step into the space created by the ADMKs exit, a senior party functionary admitted.        
	The ruling DMK-Congress alliance is trying to play down the MGR factor. Congress MLA Peter Alphonse claimed: Since the ADMK is not in the picture, everyone is digging into the MGR legacy. But the people will ultimately elect the more viable candidate who will help the constituency, which will be the DMK and the Congress.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 16: Kalinga Weavers Co-operative Spinning Mill, one of the major spinning mills in the co-operative sector, is set to be privatised.        
	A proposal to this effect was cleared by the cabinet committee on disinvestment, headed by chief minister Naveen Patnaik last evening.        
	State industries minister Biswa Bhusan Harichandan told The Telegraph that negotiation for the privatisation of the mill, closed since November 2002, would start soon.         
	It was decided that Calcutta-based Oriental Agencies, the highest bidder, would be called for negotiation, sources said.        
	The cabinet had earlier decided to privatise the sick mill soon after it was closed in November 2002. But the privatisation process started in 2007 with newspaper advertisements inviting bids.         
	Six private companies  Maharashtra-based Ruhatiya Spinners Private Limited, Hindusthan Pulverising Mills and Koustav Mining and Smelting Private Limited from Bhubaneswar, Kalahandi-based Sterlite Enterprises Private Limited and Rajashri Banijya Private Limited and Oriental Agencies from Calcutta  had submitted tenders for reopening the mill.        
	From among them, Oriental Agencies, which had quoted the highest price of Rs 6.16 crore, was selected.         
	However, Bhubaneswar-based Koustav Mining and Smelting Privatisation filed a case in the high court, which stayed the bidding process.        
	Meanwhile, the high court has lifted the stay order and dismissed the petition, following which the state public enterprise department restarted the privatisation process.         
	The closed mill has outstanding dues to the tune of Rs 13 crore. Payment of three months arrears salary to employees and workers of the mill has been pending.         
	After payment of the bid price of Rs 6.16 crore by Oriental Agencies, there would be a balance liability of Rs 7 crore to be borne by the state exchequer.        
	State industries and law departments were asked to work out sourcing of funds from the state exchequer, said a member of the cabinet committee.

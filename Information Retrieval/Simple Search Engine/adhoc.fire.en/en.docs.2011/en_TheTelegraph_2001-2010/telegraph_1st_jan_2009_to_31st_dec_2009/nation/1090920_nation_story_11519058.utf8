The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Azad finger at PMO official
                                                                                                               Azad finger at PMO official
          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 19: Ghulam Nabi Azad has accused a PMO official of conspiring against ministers by planting distorted stories in the media, setting off ripples within Congress circles stunned by the open allegation.        
	Party leaders said ministers had often suspected such manipulations by the all-powerful Prime Ministers Office but couldnt recall a minister formally levelling such an accusation.        
	Sources said a furious Azad had taken up the matter with Manmohan Singh. Asked who the official was, the Union health minister told The Telegraph: I will not name him but the Prime Minister knows who has done the mischief.        
	The controversy erupted following media reports that the Prime Minister was upset with Azads performance in his first 100 days in office and had, in a letter, given him a one-month ultimatum.        
	Azad, who last week unveiled an impressive list of achievements in the first 100 days, was furious.         
	Asked about the Prime Ministers letter, he did not deny its existence but said the facts were distorted by a PMO official. There was no ultimatum.        
	He said it was a very polite letter. Azad was so angry that he went on to say that the official concerned was doing a great disservice to the Prime Minister.        
	Officials in the PMO are usually trusted men of the Prime Minister and this kind of trust deficit with senior cabinet ministers may become the source of serious trouble in the future, Azad said. Those who sit in the PMO should not do politicking and should nurse no personal agenda, he added.        
	Singhs letter had referred to a 2007 report of a committee the Prime Minister had set up under cardiac surgeon Marthanda Verma Shankar Valiathan to prepare a blueprint to transform AIIMS into a global leader among hospitals.        
	It requested Azad to act on the recommendations. The Prime Minister also wrote that he would like to review the matter after a month.        
	Azad said the delay in taking action on the report was not his fault as he became health minister only in May 2009.

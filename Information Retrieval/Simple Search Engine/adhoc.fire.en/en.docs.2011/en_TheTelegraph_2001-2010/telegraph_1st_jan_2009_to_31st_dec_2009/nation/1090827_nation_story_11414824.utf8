The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Singh tells CBI to catch big fish
                                                                                                               Singh tells CBI to catch big fish
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Singh at the conference in Delhi. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 26: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today suggested the hunt for the corrupt had so far bypassed the top and urged the CBI to net the big fish.        
	There is a pervasive feeling today in our country that while petty cases get tackled quickly, the big fish often escape punishment. This has to change, Singh said at a conference of the CBI and state anti-corruption agencies.        
	The message would have gone across to CBI chief Ashwini Kumar and his team, who are seen as having made a string of forgery and petty crime arrests over the past few months even as big cases are relegated to the background.        
	The stress should be on aggressively pursuing corruption in high places, Singh said, and asked the agency to keep in mind public criticism. There have been occasions in the recent past when the conduct of the bureau has come in for public criticism. I would like the CBI to have a critical look at itself and introspect deeply to further improve its functioning, he said.        
	Sources in the PMO said they had expected the Prime Minister, who tends to speak his mind while addressing officers and at conferences on issues like corruption, to deliver a tough message.        
	Rapid, fair and accurate investigation of allegations of corruption in high places should remain your utmost priority, Singh said.        
	Singh also turned the spotlight on speedy prosecution, saying corruption trials should be concluded in two years. He expected the 71 new CBI courts coming up now to serve as model courts at a time over three crore petitions are waiting to be resolved.        
	Another strong message went out to the bureaucracy in general. Officials have to be encouraged to take decisions, to accept responsibility, to show initiative and, whenever required, to take risks if our bureaucracy is to shed its slothful and lethargic image.        
	The Prime Minister said officials were often unduly timid and slow for fear of harassment and damage to reputation and asked corruption-busters to make a distinction.         
	Anti-corruption agencies have to develop a system of investigation that factors this element into their thinking processes. It is as much your duty to protect the honest and the efficient as it is to prosecute and penalise the corrupt.         
	Singh used the occasion to also highlight perceived irregularities in NREGS, the governments rural job scheme. There is a constant refrain in public that much of what the government provides never reaches the intended beneficiaries, whether it is subsidised foodgrain or the benefit of employment programmes.

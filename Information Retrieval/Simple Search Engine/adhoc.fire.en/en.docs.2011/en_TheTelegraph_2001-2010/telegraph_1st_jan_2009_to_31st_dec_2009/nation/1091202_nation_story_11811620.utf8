	Pune, Dec. 1 (PTI): A private hospital here that had recorded the first swine flu death in the country has been cleared of medical negligence charges.        
	A panel of doctors was probing the death of Rida Sheikh, 14, who succumbed to the H1N1 virus on August 3 this year.        
	Rida, a student of St Annes School, died in Jehangir hospital where she was admitted on July 26 after developing swine flu symptoms.         
	The girls family subsequently filed a case of criminal negligence against the hospital.        
	The committee of five doctors from Sassoon government hospital that conducted the probe has submitted its findings to police.         
	The report would now be sent to the state directorate of health.        
	The panel said there were no stipulated guidelines for testing and sample collection when Rida was admitted.         
	She was suspected to have been infected by the virus and put on ventilator on July 29. The report said the clinical picture showed there was no negligence and the patient was treated on a day-to-day basis.         
	The experts committee was chaired by Arun Jamkar, the dean of Sassoon hospital.        
	Reedas family has also approached the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission for a Rs 5-crore compensation, accusing Jehangir hospital and Ruby Hall clinic, which carried the first rapid test for the virus, of medical negligence.         
	The city has since August 3 registered 114 swine flu deaths, the latest victim being a pregnant woman who died in a hospital yesterday.

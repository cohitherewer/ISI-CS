The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | What set off the Vienna violence 
                                                                                                               What set off the Vienna violence 
  - All you want to know          GAJINDER SINGH                          A soldier in Jalandhar. (PTI)                                        
	Arson-hit Punjab began to limp back to normal on Tuesday. Curfew was relaxed in most affected towns. Paramilitary forces and the army, however, continued to patrol Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur, Phagwara and Ludhiana where the situation remained tense but under control.         
	The scaling down in violence brought relief to stranded passengers at bus stands and railway stations.         
	The Telegraph gives you a low-down on the Deras of Punjab and why the state was gripped by violence sparked by clashes in distant Vienna.              
	 What is a Dera?         
	Dera is the headquarters of a living spiritual guru whose appointment is either hereditary or anointed. Devotees of a Dera do not necessarily belong to one religion or caste. They come from all faiths. The majority, however, belong to the weaker sections of society who flock to the Deras to seek solace and also shelter against alleged discrimination by upper caste Sikhs        
	How many Deras are there in Punjab?        
	Thousands, big and small. But only a few like Dera Sucha Sauda command a following of lakhs         
	 Do they wield any clout?        
	The Deras are much sought after during elections. Politicians cutting across party lines woo the heads for getting the votes of that Dera         
	What happened in Vienna?        
	The clash inside the Ravidas gurdwara in Vienna allegedly took place after some devotees objected to the status of guru given to Ravidas in the presence of the Guru Granth Sahib. The holy scripture is revered as a guru by Sikhs and no one is supreme in its presence. The scripture has also been bestowed the status of juristic person by the Supreme Court        
	Is Ravidas considered a guru?        
	Ravidas, a Dalit poet-saint of the 14th century, is considered a guru by followers of the Dera Sach Khand. Forty-one of Ravidass writings are incorporated in the Guru Granth Sahib. But the Sikh community has not accorded him the status of a guru. The Sikhs see the 10 gurus who founded the religion, from Guru Nanak to Guru Gobind Singh, and thereafter the Guru Granth Sahib as their guru        
	Where do Sikhs differ with the Deras?        
	Sikhs observe total sanctity to the text in the Guru Granth Sahib. No one can change or alter any of the writings of the Sikh gurus written in the holy book. The Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee, a body entrusted with the upkeep of historical gurdwaras and matters pertaining to the Sikh religion, has often sought a ban on Deras which have courted controversy by either daring to write their own Granth or for indulging in blasphemous acts like imitating Sikh gurus        
	Do all Deras alter the scripture?        
	Most Deras in Punjab preach respect and reverence for the Guru Granth Sahib. Some, however, provide their own interpretation or add to what is there in it.

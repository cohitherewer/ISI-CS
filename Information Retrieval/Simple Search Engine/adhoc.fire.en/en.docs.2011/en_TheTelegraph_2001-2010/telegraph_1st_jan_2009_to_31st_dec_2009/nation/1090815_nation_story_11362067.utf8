                                                                                                               Clash over Jindal ban on bikes
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 14: Tension prevailed on Jindal Steel premises in Kalinganagar, Jajpur, this morning following a clash between workers and plant officials.        
	Barred from driving their two-wheelers inside the premises, angry workers torched a company bus and damaged a police van. Yesterday, too, they had damaged three other buses. At least 20 employees and a policeman were injured in the altercation, police said.        
	The clash began yesterday when some workers were stopped from driving into the plant following a management order. About 1,000 outsourced plant employees scuffled with guards insisting that they be allowed to park in the factory area. While the employees tried to enter forcibly, security guards fought back, said Jajpur deputy superintendent of police B.B. Mallik.        
	The fight continued for over two hours, even as police rushed to the spot to control the situation. Employees also scuffled with the police following which the personnel resorted to mild lathicharge to disperse the mob.        
	The company banned motorcycles on plant premises to avoid rash driving and accidents and had planned to provide free bus service to employees since August 1 after an accident took place at factory on May 26.        
	Workers did not understand the intention behind the ban and turned violent, said Kalinganagar inspector in charge B.N. Samal. The situation is under control now. Three platoons of police have been stationed to avoid any untoward incidents, said Samal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Toll slip alibi for Sabharwal son 
                                                                                                               Toll slip alibi for Sabharwal son 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Himanshu                                  
	New Delhi, July 25: Himanshu Sabharwal today produced an alibi after having been detained and questioned for 12 hours yesterday over the murder of his chartered accountant, police sources said.        
	Himanshu, whom officers had yesterday termed the prime suspect, handed the police the receipt for the Rs 17 toll he had paid on Gurgaon Expressway the night of the murder.        
	The time printed on the slip places the son of murdered Ujjain professor H.S. Sabharwal far away from the Delhi University campus at the time Parminder Singh, 30, was being stabbed there on Thursday night.        
	Himanshu, who owns a filmmaking company, had said he and Parminder had parted at 11.10pm near Khalsa College after pasting posters around the campus announcing a protest march against the mass acquittals in Professor Sabharwals murder.        
	Himanshu said he left with Pooja, a journalist assisting the Sabharwal justice campaign, in his car. Saif Din, SFI secretary from nearby Ramjas College who was helping with the posters, too left for his hostel. Parminder was about to head home on his motorbike when he was killed.        
	Deputy commissioner (north) S.P. Hooda refused to comment on the matter of the alibi, saying the case had been handed over to the polices special cell. Sources, however, said the investigators were not yet giving anyone a clean chit.        
	The police have announced a Rs 50,000 reward for information on the murder.        
	Parminders wife Neetu had yesterday raised a finger at Himanshu, accusing him and her husband of being locked in a love triangle with Pooja, police sources had said. Himanshu has denied this and suggested that BJP student wing ABVP, whom he accuses of killing his father, also murdered Parminder, bringing howls of protest from the organisation.        
	That accusation today set up a bout of political activity on the DU campus with Congress student arm NSUI saying that if the police probe nailed the ABVP, it would start a campaign.        
	Today, the NSUI held a rally protesting the lax campus security that allowed Parminder to be murdered at the Khalsa Colleges doorstep near a student hostel.

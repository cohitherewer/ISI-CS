The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Elder sister rebel, younger wants to renounce 
                                                                                                               Elder sister rebel, younger wants to renounce 
          RASHEED KIDWAI                                            
	Bhopal, Aug. 14: The elder Scindia sister will not hear of quitting her party post but the younger one would rather live like a sadhvi.        
	Yashodhara Raje said she had had enough of the BJPs suffocating politics on a day didi Vasundhara laid siege to L.K. Advanis home in New Delhi to insist that she should remain the leader of the Opposition in the Rajasthan Assembly. Yashodhara, a former Gwalior princess, went so far as to say that she wished to lead an ascetic life like a Jain sadhvi.        
	The princess, who has had problems with the party in the past as well, told a congregation of sanyasins in Shivpuri that she felt suffocated in politics.         
	Yashodhara, who is the BJP Lok Sabha member from Gwalior, later told The Telegraph that she was disillusioned with the state of affairs in the Madhya Pradesh BJP unit. Look at the way I have been targeted after the Shivpuri debacle (in the 2008 Assembly polls, a Congress nominee won in her stronghold). (They are) always propping up people who have the singular programme of going after me, she said, while clarifying that she had no differences with Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan.         
	I am talking about the sangathan (organisation), and not the chief minister who has always been supportive, she said.        
	When Uma Bharti  a self-confessed sadhvi who had also gone on a brief sanyas after being disillusioned with the BJP  was the chief minister, Yashodhara had sulked for a while.         
	There was talk about her entering the Congress, but she denied it. In Gwalior, the buzz was that her nephew and Congress MP Jyotiraditya Scindia had scuttled a move initiated by Madhya Pradesh satraps Kamal Nath and Digvijay Singh to bring Yashodhara closer to the party.        
	At present, Yashodhara is embroiled in a turf battle with state BJP chief Narendra Singh Tomar and Anoop Mishra, the nephew of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Both Tomar and Mishra hail from Gwalior.         
	Yashodhara is also constantly at loggerheads with Jyotiraditya, who continues to view Gwalior as his territory despite the Congresss successive defeats in parliamentary polls from the city.        
	Jyotiraditya is the MP from Guna.        
	Yashodhara declined to comment if her sense of disillusionment had anything to do with the controversy surrounding her sister Vasundhara. In the Gwalior palace, the sisters are known to be close and cordial.        
	At Shivpuri, once part of the Gwalior princely state, the younger princess showered praise on the Jain sadhvis, who believe that women can attain anant sukh or permanent bliss through deeksha and renunciation.         
	Yashodhara, 51, wondered if she could emulate their life of self-restraint.         
	But for that, Yashodhara would have to give up a lot.        
	 The first casualty would be her trips to various polo grounds where shes a regular. She will also have to abandon the elite social circuits of Jaipur, Delhi, Mumbai, London and Paris.         
	In order to become a sadhvi, the inclination has to first come from within. The person seeking deeksha has to be with a sadhvi for years, travel and live with her before she can be admitted into the order.         
	Next comes the monastic life, which calls for complete renunciation of the world and all physical comforts. Sadhvis generally eat as much food that is necessary for living.        
	The princess may need a few tips from Uma Bharti.

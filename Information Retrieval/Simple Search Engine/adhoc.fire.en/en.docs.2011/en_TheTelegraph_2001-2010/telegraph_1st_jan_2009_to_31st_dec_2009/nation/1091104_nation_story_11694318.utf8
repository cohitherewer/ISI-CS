          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Environmentalists protest death of Olive Ridley turtles in Gahirmatha last year                                  
	Cuttack, Nov. 3: The state government has banned fishing in and around Gahirmatha Marine Sanctuary to protect the Olive Ridley sea turtles, which migrate to the Orissa coast every winter.        
	Sources said the forest department had imposed the ban from November 1 in view of the mating and nesting season of the endangered sea turtles. The restriction will continue till May 31, 2010.        
	Gahirmatha beach, which forms the eastern boundary of Bhitarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary, some 90km from here, supports the largest known nesting beach of Olive Ridley sea turtles in the world. Nearly half-a-million Olive Ridleys nest every year at Gahirmatha. Besides, the coastal waters off Gahirmatha are a major mating area for the turtles before nesting.        
	The ban is being enforced under the Orissa Marine Fishing Regulation Act, 1982, and the Orissa Marine Fishing Rules, 1983.        
	The divisional forest officer of Rajnagar mangrove forest (wildlife) division, P.K. Behera, said fishing had been banned around 20km of the Gahirmatha seashore.        
	Steps were also underway to set up onshore and offshore camps to keep a watch on illegal entry of trawlers to the sanctuary area during the seven-month ban period, he said.        
	The forest officials plan to step up night-patrolling with the help of coast guard personnel and marine police after the Olive Ridleys are sighted.         
	We have sought help from coast guard, marine police and Defence Research Development Organisation personnel to step up surveillance in and around Gahirmatha coast during nesting, Behera said.        
	The DRDO personnel are expected to initiate steps to mask defence-lighting system at the nearby Wheeler Island during mass nesting to prevent the turtles getting disoriented on the beach.

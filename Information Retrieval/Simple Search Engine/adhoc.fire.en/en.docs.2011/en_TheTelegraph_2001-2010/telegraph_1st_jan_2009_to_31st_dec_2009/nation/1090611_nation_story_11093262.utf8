          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 10: The Centre has begun to appear as though it is prevaricating on the womens quota bill.        
	Parliamentary affairs minister P.K. Bansal today avoided a definite answer on whether the bill would be brought in Parliament in the budget session despite its primacy in Sonia Gandhis agenda.        
	The bill in its present form is with the (parliamentary) standing committee. The government will take a view after the report comes in, he said.        
	Asked if the Centre proposed to dilute the 33 per cent quota to overcome opposition from the RJD and the Samajwadi Party, he said: The question is hypothetical. Let the report come.        
	Sources said Congress leaders were very concerned about whether the introduction of the bill would be aborted again. They have apparently come round to the view that efforts should be made to evolve a consensus despite the support of the BJP and the Left parties.        
	The Congress is also worried about the BJPs suggestion that instead of reserving seats in Parliament, parties should be mandated to give one-third of party tickets to women.        
	If the BJP is having second thoughts on the bill, the government could be in trouble, a source said.        
	Amid the buzz that the 33 per cent quota could be pared, the Left has said it will not settle for anything less.        
	We have not thought of percentage or quota yet, a Congress leader said, indicating the party could have an open mind if push came to shove.        
	Sources said the UPAs first priority would be to pass the general and rail budgets before the vote-on-account lapses on July 31.        
	The passage of the budgets is most important. Everything else will come after that, a source said, adding the womens bill might have to wait till the winter session.

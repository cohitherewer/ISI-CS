	Washington, July 25 (PTI): An Indian American who robbed a bank of $23,000 and was nabbed after a car chase across four counties has pleaded guilty and faces a jail term of up to 25 years.        
	Sukhu and his gang had walked into a Bank of America branch in Maryland last year and forced a teller to hand over the money. Sukhu shot at the teller to make him part with the money.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 21: The results of the August 18 Assembly bypolls in five states came as a reality check for the Congress, a day after the party declared it would fight the byelections for 18 seats in Bihar alone.        
	The Congress felt it would be suicidal to team up with its former Bihar allies, Lalu Prasads Rashtriya Janata Dal and Ram Vilas Paswans Lok Janshakti Party.        
	If the UPA managed to win nine of the 17 seats whose results were declared today, it was largely because of the Congresss allies, the DMK and the Trinamul Congress.         
	The Congress netted two seats in Tamil Nadu by piggybacking on the DMK. On its own, it won Laitumthrak in Meghalaya, lost all four in Uttar Pradesh where its performance in the Lok Sabha polls had kindled hopes of a revival, and picked up just one of the five seats in Karnataka.        
	If there is a lesson in this, it is we should immediately forge an alliance with the Dal(S) and prevent a division of the secular votes, a general secretary said.        
	The Congress sounded a bit more optimistic about Uttar Pradesh, where despite its candidates losing their deposits in two constituencies Bidhuna and Morna  sources put the losses down to the time-tested logic of ruling parties romping home in byelections.         
	When it was pointed out that this theory did not work in Karnataka, where the BJP kept only two seats, and in Bengal, where the Left Front drew a blank, a source had no answer.        
	In Uttar Pradesh, the BSP won three of the four seats.        
	The BSP wrested Malihabad and Bidhuna from the Samajwadi Party and Moradabad (west) from the BJP.         
	BSP sources attributed the results to chief minister Mayavatis mid-course corrections after the Lok Sabha rout, a consolidation of the Dalit votes and an accretion in their backward caste support.         
	In Moradabad (west) for instance, the BSP had put up a backward caste Saini candidate, Balwan Singh.         
	Humayun Qadir, a party secretary in the constituency, said that even though the Congress got 60 per cent of the 1,50,000 Muslim votes and the Samajwadis 20 per cent, the BSP won by nearly 18,000 votes because of the consolidation of the backward caste and Dalit votes.         
	If the Congress held on to the Muslim votes, Qadir conceded it was because of Moradabad MP Mohammad Azharuddins magic.

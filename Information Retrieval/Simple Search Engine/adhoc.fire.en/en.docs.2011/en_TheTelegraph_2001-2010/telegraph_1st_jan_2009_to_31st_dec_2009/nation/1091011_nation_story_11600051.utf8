          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 10: Orissa will soon have an independent and pragmatic tourism policy to attract international tourists with incentives to woo private investment in this sector.        
	Tourism minister Debi Prasad Mishra said the new policy would provide tax exemptions, fiscal incentives and subsidies for investment in the tourism and hospitality industry. The state government had entrusted PricewaterhouseCoopers with the formulation of the new policy and a draft policy has already been submitted to the state, said Mishra.         
	The policy will be formulated following wider consultations with various experts and stakeholders, said the minister while addressing a consultation meeting here yesterday.        
	After consultations, the draft policy will be subjected to inter-departmental and ministerial deliberation before final approval by the chief minister, he said.        
	The emphasis in the new policy will be on promotion of eco-tourism, tribal and ethnic tourism, heritage tourism and health tourism to attract international tourists, tourism department officials said.        
	Tourism projects in public-private partnership mode will be encouraged, added the officials. Orissa did not have any tourism policy till 1997. Tourism promotion activities were being carried out according to the provisions of Industrial Policy Resolutions announced from time to time.        
	For the first time, a tourism policy of the state was declared in 1997. But the policy now needs to be updated keeping the changing global scenario and demands of international tourists in mind.        
	The state government aims to attract 80,000 international and 10 million domestic visitors by 2012.        
	Representatives of Hotel and Restaurant Association of Orissa and tour operators expressed their concern over the fall in foreign traffic inflow due to the advisory issued by the European Union advising international tourists against visiting Orissa in view of last years communal violence in Khandhamal.         
	The matter has been taken up by the Union tourism ministry, said Mishra.

	Bhubaneswar, April 23: The final round of polling for 11 Lok Sabha and 77 Assembly seats in Orissa was marred by clashes and incidents of booth capturing.         
	At Kendrapada, sitting BJD MLA Sharada Prasad Nayak was taken into police custody for disturbing poll peace, while police resorted to lathicharge to keep away an irate mob that had taken the leader under house arrest.        
	The BJD MLA was arrested for barging into Talakusuma High School booth under Patkura Assembly segment of Kendrapara Lok Sabha constituency.         
	We have arrested Nayak under provisions of Representation of Peoples Act. The incident is being investigated, said Kendrapara additional superintendent of police, Kumarmani Meher.         
	The MLA has been detained at the Patkura police and the four-wheeler used by him and his supporters has been seized.        
	Talking to The Telegraph, director-general of police M.M. Praharaj, however, assured that polling was by and large peaceful, barring a few stray incidents.        
	Not a single incident of Maoist-related violence was reported today, he said.        
	In the first phase of election on April 16, Maoists had disrupted polling at Malkangiri and Sundergarh, had attacked booths and looted election voting machines.        
	At least a dozen incidents of clashes between BJD, Congress and BJP cadre, were reported from Kendrapara alone and others from Banki, Nayagarh, Athgarh, Korei, Badamba, Anandpur and Bhadrak Assembly seats, forcing the police to resort to mild lathicharge in which 12-odd people were injured.        
	Ten persons were injured in the clashes. Seven sustained injuries in a clash between police and voters at two booths under Banki segment, while a man was injured at Pankal booth in Athagarah. Similarly, two persons were injured at Haripur in Nayagarh segment.         
	In Rairangpur, voters from nine villages boycotted the poll to protest against government apathy. Voting was suspended in Korei segment (Jajpur) and in Banta block (Bhadrak) after clashes. Tension also prevailed at Badamba after women voters clashed with police.         
	Report from Keonjhar said some criminals attempted to capture a booth at Ragahabpur in Anandpur.

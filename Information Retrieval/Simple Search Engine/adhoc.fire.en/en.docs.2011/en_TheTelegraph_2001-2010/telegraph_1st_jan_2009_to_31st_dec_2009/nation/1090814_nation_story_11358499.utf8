The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tytler talk baffles Cong
                                                                                                               Tytler talk baffles Cong
          NALIN VERMA                          Jagdish Tytler                                  
	Patna, Aug. 13: Despite Ram Vilas Paswan and Lalu Prasads overtures to revive a Congress-RJD-LJP alliance in Bihar, AICC general secretary and in-charge of Bihar affairs Jagdish Tytler has said that his party would contest the coming by-elections to seven Assembly seats alone on September 10.         
	The Election Commission today announced the dates.         
	The ruling JD(U)-BJP combination that has not lost a poll since four years, is still working as a well-oiled unit in the state. Contrary to the NDA, the Bihar Congress has been reduced to a tottering outfit. A large section of the party is busy fighting a battle to replace BPCC chief Anil Sharma, than dislodge Nitish Kumar.         
	Congress leaders held a meeting at the house of former Congress Aurangabad MP Nikhil Kumar demanding Sharmas replacement. We will also meet the party high command on August 15 to press for Sharmas removal, said senior leader Umakant Singh.         
	Incidentally, these Congress rebels had their meeting soon after Jagdish Tytler left Patna after explaining the Rahul Gandhi-sponsored party revival roadmap at the grassroots in Bihar last week.         
	While explaining the map, Tytler set dislodging Nitish Kumar and going into the polls as the partys goal.         
	Tytlers approach has virtually baffled the observers. How can a party which has defunct organisations in 23 out of 38 states talk of contesting the polls on its own, asked a senior party leader. He added: the Congress is empty from within. It is not in a position to find candidates for seats.         
	Party sources revealed to The Telegraph that the Congress did not have its block committees existing in 350 of the states 584 blocks. Moreover, the AICC has 143 members from Bihar, out of which 60 are not even delegates of Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee. The party, according to sources, has at least 25 AICC members from the state who are old living a retired life in New Delhi rather than actively working in Bihar.         
	The party borrowed 18 candidates from other parties, including RJD, after severing ties with the RJD-LJP and deciding to fight alone in the last Lok Sabha polls. And 15 out of the 18 borrowed players forfeited their security deposits while the Congress had to content itself with barely two of the states 40 Lok Sabha seats.         
	The party can not be revived until BPCC chief Anil Sharma is replaced by an experienced campaigner, said another senior leader Premchand Mishra.         
	Observers, however, believe that removal of Sharma can not instil life in the party that stands moribund by all practical purposes.

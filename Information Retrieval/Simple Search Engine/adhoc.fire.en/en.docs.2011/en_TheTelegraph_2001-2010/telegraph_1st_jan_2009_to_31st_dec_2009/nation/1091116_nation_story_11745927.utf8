          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 15: LIC agents have challenged in the Supreme Court planned amendments that seek to replace the commission they receive from the corporation with a fee to be paid by customers.        
	The changes have been proposed in the LIC (Amendment) Bill, 2009, which has already been introduced in the Lok Sabha. There are 14 lakh such agents in the country, most of them unemployed youths, housewives and people from disadvantaged groups.         
	This is going to harm our business. As it is, it is difficult to induce people to insure themselves. Charging them a fee for it will make matters worse, said lawyer C.B.N. Babu, who has filed the petition on behalf of the Rajahmundry division of the LIC Agents Association.         
	Another potential problem, the petition said, is that competition among agents could push down the fee and add to their woes.        
	The agents are also opposing changes that seek to do away with sections of the LIC Act that now entitle them to earn commissions even if they are incapacitated or unable to work because of illness.         
	Babu claimed that the profession was not lucrative and only allowed a certain degree of flexibility in earnings and work timings.         
	Insurance selling is a difficult job not only in India but throughout the world. Very few people take it up and (those who do) mostly choose it when they fail in other professions, the petition said.        
	The petition has sought to make the Union government, the law ministry and the LIC chairman parties to the case.

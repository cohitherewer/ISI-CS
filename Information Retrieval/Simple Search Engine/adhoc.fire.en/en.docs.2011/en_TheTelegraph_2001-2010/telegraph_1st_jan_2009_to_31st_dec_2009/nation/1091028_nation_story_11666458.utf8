The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rural focus begins to tell on infant survival
                                                                                                               Rural focus begins to tell on infant survival
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 27: Indias investments in rural health may be yielding dividends in infant mortality rates  a decline in IMR in rural areas comparable, even exceeding, the pace of improvement in urban India.        
	A survey by the governments census department has shown a five-point decline in national IMR  from 58 to 53 deaths per 1,000 live births  over the past five years, while IMR declined six points in rural India, but four points in urban areas.        
	Health officials said the encouraging pace of decline in rural areas may be the impact of the National Rural Health Mission which has added tens of thousands of medical staff and nearly seven lakh community health workers to rural India in the past four years.        
	Overall, the speed of decline is comparable  nine per cent in rural India and 10 per cent in urban areas.         
	But differences surface across states. In Bengal, the figures show, urban IMR remained stagnant at 29 deaths per 1,000 live births between 2006 and 2008, while the rural IMR declined from 40 to 37.         
	In Chhattisgarh, the decline is 4.8 per cent in rural areas and 4 per cent in urban areas.        
	The patterns are particularly encouraging in areas where accredited social health activists (ASHAs) have helped improve the demand for maternal health services and early infant health care, said Amarjit Sinha, joint secretary in-charge of the National Rural Health Mission.        
	The IMR in 2008 for Chhattisgarh is 59 per 1,000 live births  13 points below the IMR for Madhya Pradesh. Field surveys suggest the ASHAs in Chhattisgarh have promoted exclusive breast-feeding for neonates with significant effect.        
	Public health experts say neonatal mortality and malnutrition remain the main contributors to infant mortality in India. If we can tackle neonatal mortality and malnutrition, the decline in IMR could be even faster, Sinha said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Kasab gets offer from lawyer
                                                                                                               Kasab gets offer from lawyer
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                               Khan (top), Kasab				                                 
	New Delhi, Dec. 31: Mohammed Ajmal Kasab finally has a terror lawyer to defend him  and with a reputation to boot.         
	Shanwar Khan, a lawyer at Delhis Patiala House courts, has offered assistance to the militant, the lone gunman captured alive during the Mumbai carnage last month.        
	The 35-year-old has a CV that is sure to impress Kasab.        
	Khan has 44 terror-related cases in his kitty and has managed successful acquittals in six out of eight cases in which verdicts have been delivered.        
	His list of terror clients includes 19 persons accused in the Ahmedabad blast case.         
	Everyone has the right to a fair trial. I am a professional and, as an Indian, I think that denying Kasab a lawyer would mean that we are not an impartial judiciary.        
	I firmly believe that everyone is innocent before being held guilty by the court, Khan said, pointing out that according to Sections 202 and 203 of the Criminal Procedure Code an accused was entitled to the right to defence.        
	Khans offer came days after policemen identified Kasab at an identification parade as one of the militants who stormed Mumbai.        
	Khan, popularly known as a terror lawyer among his peers, was not the only one to have offered to defend Kasab. Four Mumbai lawyers had made the offer before backing out fearing reprisal from political activists.        
	The Bombay Metropolitan Magistrates Court Bar Association had also adopted a resolution that none of its members would defend or represent any offender involved in the attack that claimed over 170 lives.        
	Khan, a graduate from Delhi University who did his law from Bundelkhand University, said he wasnt feeling any pressure.        
	Its part of my job, said the young lawyer who started practising nine years ago with his father M. Khan.         
	Kasab has as much right to be defended as people like Lt Col Purohit and sadhvi Pragya (both accused in the September 29 Malegaon blast) and Nalini (who is serving a life term for involvement in Rajiv Gandhis assassination).        
	Lawyers in Delhi, he added, were unaffected by his decision to defend Kasab. We are, after all, professionals, he said.        
	Among Khans other clients are those accused of planting improvised explosive devices near the Border Security Force headquarters and the Sena Bhavan in the capital in 2002.         
	Khan is now readying to approach the Maharashtra government after courts reopen on January 2.

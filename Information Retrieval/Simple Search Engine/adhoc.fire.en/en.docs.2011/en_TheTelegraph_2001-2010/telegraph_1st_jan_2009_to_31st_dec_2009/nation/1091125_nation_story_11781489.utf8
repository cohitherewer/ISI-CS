          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Nov. 24: The Nitish Kumar bonanza wagon rolls on. Rs 10,000 scholarship for every girl securing first division in Class X exams, subsidy of Rs 15 to farmers on diesel per litre and monthly hike of Rs 1,000 in teachers salary were some sops the chief minister announced today on completion of four years in office.        
	When Nitish came to power, Bihar did not enjoy the tag of a developed state. But what Bihar thinks today, the country adopts tomorrow, he said today, using the occasion to highlight how the state had moved ahead from the age of bullock cart to e-governance in a short period of time.        
	Bihar was first to reserve 50 per cent seats in panchayat and other local bodies for women  a model that the Centre adopted later.         
	Similarly, the state was the first to implement the Right to Information Act with other states following later.        
	Nitish was all appreciation about his friend-turned-archrival RJD issuing marks-sheets on the performance of his government. At least, even the RJD, our primary critic, has not given negative marks to our government. We have secured some marks even from the RJD, Nitish said with a smile.        
	Even RJD chief Lalu Prasad has turned positive. At least, he and his party have developed a habit of keeping track on what the government is doing by issuing a chargesheet. I thoroughly appreciate the efforts.        
	Since it was the last report card day before Assembly elections next year, the chief minister made many announcements, which suggested that he was preparing for polls next year. The government would fill all the posts in the police and education departments. We are going to appoint a large number of teachers and constables in the near future, he said, highlighting the Bihar Public Service Commission had been conducting the examinations for five batches at a time.        
	Describing his governments efforts to keep on interacting with the masses while carrying out development work, Nitish enumerated his Vikas Yatra (development march), agriculture expert camps in villages and his Janata ke Darbar Mein Mukhyamantri (CM in peoples court) besides farmers field school programmes in the remote areas as part of the governments efforts to develop the state in consultation with the people who are actual rulers in democracy.        
	Nitish was quite critical of the Centre for denying Bihar its genuine due.         
	Stressing that his government would carry on its policy of development with justice, Nitish said 423.36 acres of land for construction of houses had been distributed among 20,022 poor and needy families.         
	Besides, the state has also distributed 64.09 acres of ceiling surplus land among landless beneficiaries.

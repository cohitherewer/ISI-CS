          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 22: Success has many fathers.        
	The information and broadcasting ministrys year-end review has cited Oscar-winning films Slumdog Millionaire and Smile Pinki  both foreign productions  on its list of highlights for 2009.        
	Many accolades were won by the Indian film industry during 2009. History was created when Slumdog Millionaire and Smile Pinki bagged the prestigious Oscar awards, bringing global attention to the Indian film sector, the review, released today, says.        
	Slumdog, which won eight Oscars, is a rags-to-riches tale of a Mumbai teen who grew up in a slum. Smile Pinki, which won best documentary (short subject), tells the story of a poor village girl whose life is transformed when she receives free surgery to correct her cleft lip.        
	While Oscar awardees Gulzar and A.R. Rahman may not have come through government-run film institutes, the I amp;B ministrys claim on Resul Pookutty, who won the award for best sound mixing, is understandable. Pookutty is an alumnus of Punes Film and Television Institute of India.        
	What Slumdog seems to have achieved for India is reflected in the number of foreign film production houses that have requested permission to shoot in the country.

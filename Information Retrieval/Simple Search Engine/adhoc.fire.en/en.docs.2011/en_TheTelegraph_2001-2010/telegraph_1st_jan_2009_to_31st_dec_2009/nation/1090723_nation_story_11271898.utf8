          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, July 22: The Right to Education Bill passed by the Rajya Sabha on Monday is riddled with loopholes that will only legally sanctify existing inequalities in Indias school education, two educationists have said.         
	By stopping short of providing a common schooling system, the bill in its present form discriminates between students in government schools and private unaided schools, the educationists have independently argued.         
	Biologist Pushpa M. Bhargava who was vice-chairman of the National Knowledge Commission has written to the Prime Minister, requesting him not to table the current bill in the Lok Sabha.         
	Educationist Anil Sadagopal, a member of the Central Advisory Board on Education sub-panel that prepared the first draft of the bill, is petitioning Speaker Meira Kumar requesting her to return the bill for further discussions.         
	The bill aims to make schooling for children between 6 and 14 a fundamental right.         
	Though the bill is titled the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Bill, it does not alleviate the financial burden on poor parents who send their children to private schools.         
	Under the bill, each private school will have to reserve 25 per cent seats for economically weaker section (EWS) children, and the government will compensate the schools.         
	The government will be required to compensate only the tuition fees.         
	On an average, the central and state governments spend between Rs 2,000 and Rs 2,500 per child a year in its schools. Most private schools charge much more from their students. And students in the EWS quota will have to shell out the balance amount, Sadagopal argued.         
	Many private schools also charge additionally from students for several extra curricular activities. These charges are not covered under the bill.         
	In effect, the EWS quota students will have to battle huge peer pressures in studying, Sadagopal argued.         
	He has also criticised the government for not detailing in the bill how it plans to allocate resources for its implemention.         
	Bhargava, in his letter to the Prime Minister, has argued that the bill will effectively lead to the government subsidising private schools instead of ensuring school education for all.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Aug. 24: A ballistic expert today contradicted Ajmal Kasabs claim that he had never fired at assistant sub-inspector Tukaram Oombale, who died fighting the Pakistani gunmen on November 26 night.        
	Tests on the two bullets found in Oombales body have shown they were fired from Kasabs AK-47, Vasudeo Patil told the court trying the 26/11 case. Patil is an assistant chemical analyser with the Kalina Central Forensic Science Laboratory.        
	In his July 20 confession in court, Kasab had denied killing Oombale. He had claimed he had passed out after the police punched him in the stomach and had woken up at Nair Hospital where he was treated for hand injuries.        
	The evidence by the ballistic expert is clinching evidence against Kasab. It nails his lie, said public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam.        
	Oombale was part of the police team that intercepted the Skoda carrying Kasab and his accomplice Ismail Khan at Girgaum Chowpatty and arrested Kasab alive.        
	Nikam said Patil had also testified that eight bullets recovered from the dead and injured at CST had matched Kasabs weapon.         
	State home minister Jayant Patil today jumped the gun, telling reporters the court would deliver its verdict by September 15. Nikam declined to comment on this.

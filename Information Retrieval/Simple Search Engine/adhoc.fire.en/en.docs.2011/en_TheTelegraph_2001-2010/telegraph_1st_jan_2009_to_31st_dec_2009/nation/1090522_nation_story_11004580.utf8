	New Delhi, May 21: A day before the government is sworn in, there was disquiet in the Congress over unconfirmed reports that several heavyweights who have not fought the elections could make it to the ministry.        
	In the absence of a credible list of ministerial nominees, speculation continued over A.K. Antony returning as defence minister. Talk of former chief ministers Vilasrao Deshmukh and S.M. Krishna making it to the cabinet surprised Congress MPs. The names of Janardhan Dwivedi, Motilal Vora, Mohsina Kidwai and Montek Singh Ahluwalia also kept doing the rounds.        
	Antony, Dwivedi, Vora and Kidwai are members of the Rajya Sabha. If Ahluwalia, the deputy chairperson of the Planning Commission, is made a minister, he too will come through the upper House. He will then be given the Delhi seat that falls vacant because Rajya Sabha member J.P. Aggarwal has won the Lok Sabha polls this time.        
	Deshmukh was removed as Maharashtra chief minister for his inept handling of the 26/11 terrorist attack on Mumbai, the sack coming after he took actor-son Riteish and filmmaker Ram Gopal Varma on a tour of the Taj hotel after it was cleared of terrorists.        
	Young MPs like Milind Deora, who was elected from South Mumbai and is thought to be close to Rahul Gandhi, had gone on record to say Deshmukhs removal and Union home minister Shivraj Patils exit helped the Congress win all seven seats in Mumbai. This camp is sure Deshmukhs induction would send a wrong signal.        
	As for Krishna, senior Congress leaders wondered why the former Karnataka chief minister should be rewarded when the party had performed miserably in the recent Assembly polls. Besides, he is said to have shied from contesting the Lok Sabha poll.        
	Party leaders asked why Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh were not looking at the pool of talent  206 MPs  that the Lok Sabha election has thrown up.         
	In 2004, the inclusion of Ambika Soni, Antony, Vayalar Ravi, P.M. Sayeed, Shivraj Patil, Arjun Singh and others from the Rajya Sabha could be justified because the Congress tally in the lower House was just 148, the leaders argued.         
	But now there was little justification in packing the ministry with Rajya Sabha MPs, said a senior leader recently elected to the Lok Sabha.        
	There was also disquiet over talk of induction of elite, urban and well-connected young MPs as ministers.        
	Party leaders agreed on the need for infusion of fresh blood in the government, but asked why the likes of Jyotiraditya Scindia, Milind Deora, Sachin Pilot, Jitin Prasada and Priya Dutt were being considered for junior berths ahead of many three- and four-term MPs, who are lesser known in the Delhi durbar.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Modi up but nothing magical 
                                                                                                               Modi up but nothing magical 
          BASANT RAWAT                              
	Ahmedabad, May 16: The BJP may have talked up Narendra Modi as a future Prime Minister but the perceived transformation has not reflected on the ground in his home state.         
	The BJP and the Congress have more or less repeated their 2004 performance in Gujarat, Modis party adding one to the 14 it won last time and the Congress losing one to finish with 11.        
	The only consolation for the chief minister was that he could ensure the defeat of two rivals, Union ministers Shankersinh Vaghela and Narayan Rathwa.        
	For the Congress, the unexpected defeat of Vaghela, Rathwa and Madhusudan Mistry is a setback.        
	But Modi, too, suffered a blow as four handpicked candidates  Lalji Mer, Bhavsinh Rathod, Somji Damor and Devusinh Chauhan  lost. He had lured them away from the Congress.        
	The Congress made inroads into Saurashtra, a BJP bastion, winning Porbander, Rajkot and Surendranagar. In the past 20 years, the BJP had never lost Rajkot. The BJP retained its hold in Vadodara, Bharuch and Surat.        
	The Patel community, the backbone of the BJP, chose to stay with the party, giving L.K. Advani a victory margin of 1.25 lakh votes over Congresss Suresh Patel in Gandhinagar. Mallika Sarabhai, an Independent, got 9,000 votes.

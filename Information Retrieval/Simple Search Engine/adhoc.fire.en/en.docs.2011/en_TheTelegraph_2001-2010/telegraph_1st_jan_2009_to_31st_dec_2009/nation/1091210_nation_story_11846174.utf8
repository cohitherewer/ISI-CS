The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | President chopper hits shed 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      President chopper hits shed 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT AMP; PTI                              
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 9: The rotor blades of President Pratibha Patils helicopter hit a shed while landing at Bhubaneswar this evening, prompting probes by the air force and the civil aviation regulator.        
	The incident occurred around 5pm when Patil was returning to the Orissa capital from a tour of Puri and Konark with husband Devi Singh Shekhawat and governor M.C. Bhandari. An aide of the President and two crew members were the others on board the Indian Air Forces Mi-8 chopper.        
	Everyone in the chopper is safe. A court of inquiry has been ordered, an Indian Air Force spokesperson, Wing Commander T.K. Singha, said in Delhi. The blades were damaged after hitting the shed near the parking bay, he added.        
	The Directorate-General of Civil Aviation, the civil aviation regulator, will also conduct a probe, official sources said in Delhi. The director of Bhubaneswar airport, Sanjay Jain, said the inquiry had already started. An airport official said the chopper became unstable for a while after its blades hit the wall.         
	Todays incident comes 10 months after an air force helicopter in the Presidential entourage landed in front of an Air India plane about to take off in Mumbai, narrowly missing a collision.        
	An IAF-DGCA probe into the February 9 close shave had found that the chopper landed without clearance from the air traffic control.        
	Less than seven months later, in September, then Andhra chief minister Y.S.R. Reddy died when his chopper crashed in blinding rain.        
	In Bhubaneswar today, collector Narayan Chandra Jena, who was part of the officials waiting to receive the VIPs, said Patil appeared completely calm when she stepped out of the helicopter.        
	Airport director Jain ruled out any visibility problem, the reference assuming significance after claims that Rahul Gandhis chopper landed two days back in Uttar Pradeshs Sitapur when it was dark.        
	The President drove to the Raj Bhavan for her scheduled night halt.

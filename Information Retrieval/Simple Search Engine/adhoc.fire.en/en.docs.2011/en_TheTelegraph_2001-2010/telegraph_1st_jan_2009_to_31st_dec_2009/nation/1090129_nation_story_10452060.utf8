	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 28: From metal jewellery to craft items  everything is available here at the weeklong tribal fair, which began today.        
	Thousands of people thronged the Adivasi Exhibition Ground to check out the exotic spices, forest medicines, handicraft items and even musical instruments brought by tribals from different districts.        
	With replicas of huts made up with tribal lifestyle, customs and tradition, the exhibition provides a true ambience for curious city-dwellers. At least 100 stalls have been set up at the fair with representation of 25 integrated tribal development agencies, NGOs and a number of self-help groups.        
	Overwhelmed and thrilled at the opportunity, Sanatana Nayak of Malkangiri said: This is my second visit here but this time the sale is better than the last. I will like to come here again.         
	Items of iron, bronze and bell metals are the hot favourites while indigenous musical instruments are also getting increasingly popular.         
	There has been a good sale of musical instruments like dhol, tipri, bansuri, bean among others. While they are mostly for decorative purposes, some keep it as collection, too, said Makura Raita of Koraput.        
	About 15 couples from different tribes are here to perform at the dance and music programmes lined up each evening at the fair. Coming all the way from Mayurbhanj, Hemlata Dankulia said: I came for the folk dances. During day, I sell spices with my father and in the evening, I perform. At my village, I perform during wedding.        
	Paintings of about 62 tribal cultures depicting different lifestyles have been another crowd-puller at the fair.

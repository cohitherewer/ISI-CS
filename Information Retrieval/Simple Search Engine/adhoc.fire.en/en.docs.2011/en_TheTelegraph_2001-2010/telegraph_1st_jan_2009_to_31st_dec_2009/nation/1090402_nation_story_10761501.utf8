      14 DAYS TO GO*              
	Senas Jai ho      
	Pune: If the Congress is on song, the Shiv Sena isnt out of tune either.    
	The Sena will come up with its answer to Jai ho, the Slumdog chartbuster with which the Congress is galvanising voters after it secured rights to the A.R. Rahman number.    
	The Sena song, composed by a noted Marathi crooner, will be released at a BJP-Sena rally in Mumbai on April 5. The campaign song by Avdhut Gupte will be released at the joint BJP-Sena rally at Shivaji Park in Mumbai that day, a Sena spokesperson said.     
	The BJPs prime ministerial candidate, L.K. Advani, and Sena leader Uddhav Thackeray are to address the gathering.     
	Guptes song is high on the Maharashtra theme, focusing on the states contribution to nation-building. Its CDs will be played at all Sena branches in the run-up to the polls.    
	Vote bar    
	Varanasi: Free to contest, not to vote.    
	Mukhtar Ansaris nomination papers have been cleared but the jailed BSP candidate from the Varanasi Lok Sabha seat cant vote.    
	The jail manual does not have any guideline to permit an undertrial prisoner to cast his vote, said R.K. Tripathi, superintendent of the Ghazipur jail where Ansari has been lodged.    
	District electoral officer Ajay Kumar Upadhyay, who is also the Varanasi district magistrate, said Ansaris nomination papers were found valid during the scrutiny.     
	Ansari has been in prison for over three years in the murder case of BJP MLA Krishnanad Rai. Tripathi said he had no knowledge of any undertrial being allowed to cast his vote from the jail.    
	Booze flows    
	Noida: Come polls, bootleggers start flowing.    
	Election agents of all parties are alleged to have been bringing liquor from Haryana, where it is 40 per cent cheaper because of lower taxes, to woo voters in this satellite town near Delhi.     
	The liquor mafia is said to have been active, shipping in vanloads of bottles. Some consignments are coming in cars and even two-wheelers to evade detection. Two such smugglers were arrested on Tuesday with around 50 bottles.    
	Police recently arrested 11 smugglers and recovered the Haryana liquor. They claimed the bottles were for sale to election agents.

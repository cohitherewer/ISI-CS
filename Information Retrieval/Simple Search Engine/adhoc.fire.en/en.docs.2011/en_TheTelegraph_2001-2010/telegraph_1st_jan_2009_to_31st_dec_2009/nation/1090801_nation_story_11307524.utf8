The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Left battered for rural inaction
                                                                                                               Left battered for rural inaction
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               Kalyan Banerjee, Gurudas Dasgupta				                                 
	New Delhi, July 31: Pointing fingers at others for failing to prevent job losses can be tricky if your own record in providing employment to some of the poorest is poor.         
	Left MPs initiating a discussion on rising retrenchment today came under fire from Trinamul Congress counterparts and even the labour minister for the Bengal governments poor record in implementing the UPAs flagship rural job scheme.         
	Their allegations of government inaction on rising job losses were drowned out in repeated, aggressive reminders that Bengal was among the countrys worst performers under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act.         
	Bengal has provided just 14 days work annually for each worker registered under the NREGA till date as compared to the national average of 32.         
	What have you done in Bengal? What is the situation there? How is the NREGA doing there? Trinamul MP Kalyan Banerjee shot back at CPIs Gurudas Dasgupta who initiated the discussion in the Lok Sabha.         
	Along with Dasgupta, CPM leader Basudev Acharya and Kerala MP A. Sampath started the discussion by alleging that the Centre was ignoring the plight of retrenched workers while assisting struggling industries.         
	It is fine that you show your compassion for the corporate sector by showering them with stimulus packages. But what about workers losing their jobs in the slowdown? Dasgupta asked.         
	The CPI leader cited the absence of concern on rising unemployment in the Presidents address to Parliament last month, and in the Union budget, to suggest that job loss was a non-issue for this government.        
	Acharya asked whether the government had made industries benefiting from stimulus packages commit that they would not retrench workers.         
	Throughout their argument, the Left MPs were needled by Trinamul and Congress MPs  with ministers Saugata Roy, Mukul Roy and party whip Sudip Bandopadhyay firing barb after barb.         
	Earlier, during question hour, Trinamul MP Ratna De asked for the number of working hours Bengal was providing per registered person under the NREGA.         
	As labour minister Mallikarjuna Kharge reeled off statistics on Bengals performance, Trinamul MPs shouted: Shame! Shame!         
	Kharge, a former Karnataka minister who usually sits silent in the House, didnt spare the Left either. What is happening in the places you are ruling? he asked.         
	As Dasgupta and Acharya alleged that the labour ministrys response on the job loss discussion had been drafted by Pranab Mukherjees finance ministry, Kharge said: I am in this House for the first time after being elected to the Karnataka Assembly seven times. I had expected to learn behaviour from seniors like Gurudas Dasgupta. I was wrong.

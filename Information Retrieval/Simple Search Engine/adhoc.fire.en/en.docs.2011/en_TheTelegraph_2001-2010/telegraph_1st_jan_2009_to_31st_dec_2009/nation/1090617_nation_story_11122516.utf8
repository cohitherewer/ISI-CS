	New Delhi, June 16: India has used a UN platform to urge developed countries to take action to stop the spread of the pandemic influenza that has so far infected more people in North America, Europe and Australia than in Asia.         
	Indian health authorities have detected 31 cases of flu caused by the H1N1 virus, among which 29 patients appear to have acquired the infection outside India. Only two persons have picked it up locally from close relatives who had travelled abroad.         
	Developed countries would do a great service to the developing countries if they could contain and check the spread of the infection in their own countries, Naresh Dayal, Indias health secretary, told the UN Forum on Advancing Global Health.         
	I would urge them to take action to stop the spread of the infection, Dayal said in New York yesterday at the meeting addressing representatives of governments, UN agencies and non-government organisations.         
	The new H1N1 virus has spread to 76 countries, infected 35,928 people and killed 163 since it appeared in Mexico earlier this year, according to figures from the World Health Organisation released yesterday.         
	The US, Canada, Australia and the UK account for a disproportionately large number of cases. But public health experts believe the spread merely reflects travel patterns between affected countries.         
	Senior Indian health officials have asserted that the absence of local spread of the virus allows India a window of opportunity to try and contain the infection through aggressive tracing of contacts of infected persons and treating them with the anti-viral drug oseltamivir.         
	Were not at the stage where we have to abandon efforts to contain the infection and aim at only mitigation, a source said.         
	However, sections of virologists have said that given the life spans of previous flu pandemics  about one year  the H1N1 pandemic is still in its early phase and the patterns of spread could change in the months to come.         
	A 9-year old boy in Hyderabad who had arrived from the US today tested positive for H1N1  Indias 31st case. All the patients in India have so far shown only mild illness, said a doctor involved in treating them.

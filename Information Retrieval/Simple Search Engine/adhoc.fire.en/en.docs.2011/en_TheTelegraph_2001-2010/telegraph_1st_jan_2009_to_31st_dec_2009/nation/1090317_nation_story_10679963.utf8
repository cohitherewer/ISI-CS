The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sushma tirade against Naveen, Congress
                                                                                                               Sushma tirade against Naveen, Congress
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Bhubaneswar, March 16: Central BJP leaders today appealed to the people of Orissa to teach chief minister Naveen Patnaik a lesson in the coming Lok Sabha and Assembly polls and bring the saffron party back to power.         
	Addressing the Vijay Sankalp Samavesh in the afternoon, BJP leader and former Union minister Sushma Swaraj (in picture) said chief minister and BJD chief Naveen Patnaik had not only betrayed a partner in the BJP, but also 4 crore people of Orissa, who had voted the BJD-BJP alliance to power.         
	Naveen lost his wisdom, overestimated his strength and dumped his trusted partner, she said while referring to the recent break of alliance. In arithmetic, one plus one makes two, but in alliance arithmetic, some times one plus one makes eleven. That had happened in Orissa in past two elections. This time, Naveens arithmetic will prove incorrect and his alliance will be reduced to a big zero, said Swaraj.        
	The crowd responded with a thunderous Aur ek dhoka do, Naveen Sarkarko tod do.         
	Later at a media meet, Swaraj dismissed the BJDs counter-allegation that it was her party that betrayed the regional party as a blatant lie. Chandan Mitra, an acquaintance of Naveen, slammed Naveens dual personality. There are two sides of Naveen  one a suave and gentle man and the other is a ruthless and cold-blooded one. Of late, I have seen both sides, he said.         
	Sushma Swaraj also blamed the Congress for going hand-in-hand with the BJD and said the two would be BJPs greatest foes in the Assembly and Lok Sabha polls.         
	Stating that the BJP has never violated the coalition dharma in the past nine years, Swaraj said her party had not withdrawn support to the Naveen government that had failed to protect Swami Laxmananda Sarswati.         
	At the rally, she lambasted Naveen for heading the police department. She promised to book the killers of the seer and his associates if the party came to power in the state.

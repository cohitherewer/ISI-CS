The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Police cant probe judges, says Bharadwaj
                                                                                                               Police cant probe judges, says Bharadwaj
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 2: Law minister H.R. Bharadwaj today criticised the recent move of the Chief Justice of India to seek police and CBI help to probe corruption charges against sitting judges of superior courts.        
	The judge has to be first denuded of his office by impeachment. Only then can he be prosecuted, he said in his first open criticism of K.G. Balakrishnans move to refer at least two cases to the CBI.        
	You cant send the police and the CBI after sitting judges, Bharadwaj said on the sidelines of a conference.        
	The Chief Justice of India can pass any order on the judicial side, but if it is against a sitting judge, it is bad in law. What will happen to judicial independence, rule of law and democracy then?        
	Balakrishnan had referred two cases to the CBI: a PF scam in which crores siphoned from the Ghaziabad court treasury were allegedly used to buy gifts for judges, and a cash-at-door case in which Rs 15 lakh meant for one judge was delivered at anothers doorstep.        
	In the PF scam, the CBI has handed a report to Balakrishnan. In the second case, he is believed to have permitted the CBI to lodge an FIR against a sitting Punjab and Haryana High Court judge.        
	The government cannot thrust anything on the judiciary as it is firmly committed to its independence. It should be examined by the judiciary, Bharadwaj said.        
	He also criticised the collegium system of appointment of judges in the superior judiciary. It has led to delays in appointments, he said.

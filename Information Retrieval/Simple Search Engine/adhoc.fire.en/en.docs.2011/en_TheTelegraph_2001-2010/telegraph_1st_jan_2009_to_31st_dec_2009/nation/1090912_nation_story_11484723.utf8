	Sept. 11: Moninder Singh Pandhers acquittal in Rimpa Haldars murder may affect the five other cases against him, legal experts said today.        
	The accused will obviously use this favourable judgment in the other cases. It is wrong to say Pandher will be acquitted in all the remaining cases, but definitely he has the upper hand now, criminal lawyer Ashok Arora said.        
	Rimpas had been the first to be tried among the 19 Nithari cases, in six of which Pandher is a co-accused.        
	Although all are independent cases, there are common evidences. Pandhers acquittal can affect all the other cases, said Khalid Khan, lawyer of Rimpas father Anil.         
	Its a huge blow to the morale of the victims families, but we will appeal in the apex court.        
	Im a poor man and I have already spent Rs 10 lakh in pursuing the case, but I will fight on, said rickshaw-puller Anil, who hails from Nadia, Bengal. What can a father say whose daughter has been raped and murdered and whose murderer has been set free by a court of law?        
	He and his wife Dolly had stood in front of Pandhers Noida house, screaming in helpless anguish at its walls.        
	Of the five other cases against Pandher, the first verdict may come in the murder of Pinki Sarkar, 20. Her mother Bandana sobbed: Now I fear even Pinki will never get justice. For the first time, Im feeling very disheartened.        
	Pandhers son Karan said: He still has five more cases. Well celebrate only after he comes home a free man.

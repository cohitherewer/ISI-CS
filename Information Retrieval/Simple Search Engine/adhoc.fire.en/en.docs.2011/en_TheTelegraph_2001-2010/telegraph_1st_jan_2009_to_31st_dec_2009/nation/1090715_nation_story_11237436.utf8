The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | New officer to combat rebels
                                                                                                               New officer to combat rebels
          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, July 14: After a slew of experiments, Raman Singh will now bet on officers from the state to draw strategies and combat Maoists in Chhattisgarh.        
	The state government has created a new post of additional director-general of police (Naxalite operations) to establish better co-ordination and oversee anti-Maoist operations. Ramnivas, an IPS officer of the 1982 batch, will be the first ADGP (Naxalite operations).        
	The move is aimed at launching an offensive against the rebels by designing superb strategy and establishing better co-ordination between security personnel for a successful operations.        
	The state government had earlier hired supercop K.P.S. Gill as security adviser to take on the rebels. The experiment, however, did not work as Gill discontinued his job following sharp differences with the state officials on certain issues.        
	Before Gill, a senior IPS officer of the Madhya Pradesh cadre, R.P. Modi, was appointed the head of the cell to advise strategies for anti-Maoist operations.         
	Modi also could not bring a big change in the fight against rebels.        
	Though the inspector-general-ranked officers are presently looking after the Maoist operations, this will be the first time an ADGP-ranked officer will head the team.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Aug. 12: A Bihar court today convicted nine persons  all gangsters-turned-politicians  in the nearly decade-long trial of RJD minister Brijbihari Prasads murder.         
	The court awarded life terms to eight and a two-year jail term to one.         
	Those convicted include JD(U) MLA Vijay Kumar Shukla (in picture by Deepak Kumar), alias Munna Shukla, who unsuccessfully contested as the JD(U) nominee on north Bihars Vaishali Lok Sabha seat against RJD nominee and former Union minister Raghubansh Prasad Singh, who retained the seat. The ninth convict is Sashi Kumar Rai, also a JD(U) MLA, who has been awarded two years.         
	Judge Vijay Prakash Mishra who pronounced the verdict also imposed a fine of Rs 20,000 on each on the convicts.        
	Those awarded life terms in the case also include former LJP MP Surajbhan Singh, Rajen Tiwary, Mantu Tiwary, Lallan Singh, Sunil Singh, Mukhesh Singh and Ramniranjan Choudhary.        
	Armed assailants had gunned down Prasad, a senior minister in the former Lalu Prasad-Rabri Devi cabinet, while he was strolling on the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences premises on June 13, 1998. Ailing Prasad was in judicial custody when he was admitted to the hospital.         
	His widow, Rama Devi, who is currently a BJP MP from Sheohar Lok Sabha seat, was a complainant in the case. Another accused Sunil Singh, who was arrested and put in Beur central jail, committed suicide on November 24, 2007.         
	Brijbihari Prasad had complained of chest pain and had come out of his hospital bed to have a walk in the evening. Assailants who were allegedly lurking in the darkness rained bullets on Prasad from a close range. He died on the spot.         
	Prasads bodyguard, Laxmeshwar Sah, and aid Ravindra Bhagat, too, sustained injuries and died later.

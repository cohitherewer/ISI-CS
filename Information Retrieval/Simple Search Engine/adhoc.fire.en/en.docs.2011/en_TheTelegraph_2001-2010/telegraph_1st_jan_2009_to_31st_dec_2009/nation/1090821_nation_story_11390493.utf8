          K.P. NAYAR                          Jaswant in Delhi. (Prem Singh)                                  
	Washington, Aug. 20: Notwithstanding what happens in the BJP domestically after the expulsion of Jaswant Singh, the main Opposition party will find it very hard to replace him overseas as the man who represented its policies and principles for nearly three long decades.        
	No other Indian politician has as broad and as respected a constituency on strategic issues outside the country as the man who served as Indias minister for external affairs, defence and finance during the years when India is seen abroad as having come of age.        
	That reputation was reflected in the last five years, when he was out of the government, in Singhs simultaneous appointment as a senior fellow at Harvards Kennedy School of Government and as a visiting professor in Indian History at Oxford.        
	In November 2006, half way into his tenure as leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Chris Patten, Chancellor of Oxford University, travelled to New Delhi and offered him the post at the prestigious Christ Church.        
	The gazette of the university announced subsequently that the humanities board has conferred the title of visiting professor in Indian History on Mr Jaswant Singh, member of the Indian Parliament, leader of the Opposition.        
	As a shadow foreign and defence minister during the BJPs years in the Opposition, Singh was sought after not merely in his natural Anglo-Saxon constituency abroad.        
	He was given a platform at the highly cerebral European Forum in Alpbach in Austria, at a defence meet in Geneva and was invited to the biggest pulpit of all for strategic thinkers, the Munich Security Conference.        
	Once he was ensconced in Harvard, Singh was deluged with invitations from Stanford, Princeton, Tufts, Berkeley and other universities which struggle to get credible or articulate speakers who are in Indian public life.        
	Writing books is second nature to politicians in the US and the UK. In India, Singh was one of the few people who held high-profile elected office to have done that. It made him credible in the West.        
	Abroad, Jaswant also stood out among his contemporaries in the Indian political class for his savoir-faire. One night, after dinner, he sent red-faced managers at New Yorks Waldorf Astoria scrambling because they did not have a cognac Jaswant asked for.        
	During his most recent visit to the US, to Indiana University, his hosts booked him at a hotel a stones throw from the main campus. Most American universities have at least one hotel in or near the campus to accommodate visitors and invited speakers.        
	Jaswant checked into the modest hotel, but he obviously was not happy with the comforts it offered. Without making any fuss, he quietly sought out a place in downtown Bloomington that met his standards and moved there while keeping the other room lest his hosts were offended.        
	It was the same taste that persudaded Singh to opt for Oberois Cecil when he was travelling to Shimla this week in preference to the states Peterhoff guesthouse where the rest of the BJP leadership was staying.        
	The post of leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha took a heavy toll of what could have been a second career for Singh in recent years as a professional speaker and author.        
	In the last two years, he rejected more speaking invitations from abroad than he accepted. The most recent invitation that Singh turned down was as a speaker at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore in May because of the Lok Sabha elections and its fallout on the BJP.        
	Among the keynote speakers at this years meeting, organised by Londons International Institute for Strategic Studies were Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and US defence secretary Robert Gates.        
	When the retirement of Kofi Annan as UN secretary general at the end of 2006 was looming and it was Asias turn for a successor, Singhs name did the rounds for a while as a potential nominee. His was the only name of an Indian who had been associated with the Indian government that was whispered at the UN headquarters for some months in late 2004.         
	Several Americans, Democrats and Republicans, said at that time they would have no objection if Singh emerged as a candidate.        
	When this correspondent asked Singh then, he replied: These people, meaning the UPA, will never have me.        
	In the last five years, Singhs major lament was the same that he held against the BJP yesterday. That discourse and dialogue had broken down. The reference then was to the contacts between the ruling parties and the Opposition.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJD moves fail to deter Congress
                                                                                                               BJD moves fail to deter Congress
          LALMOHAN PATNAIK                              
	Cuttack, April 9: Citys Congress president Suresh Mohapatra, contesting from Barabati (Cuttack) seat, may be facing an uphill task as the BJD is likely to make inroads into the traditional Congress vote bank  the minority communities  but the leader seems unfazed.         
	The exit of former MLA Mustafiz Ahmed from the Congress and into the BJD has been a further jolt for Congress.         
	Party hoppers, the Congress leader said, will make little difference. Talking to The Telegraph, Mohapatra dismissed the BJD candidate as a non-entity.         
	The newly carved constituency has the largest concentration of Muslim voters in the city and some Christian voters. But, the 51-year-old Mohapatra believes: If the February civic poll was any indication, then the BJP has lost ground in the city.        
	 Though the BJD swept the polls, Congress gave a tough fight in almost all the wards.         
	Mohapatra, who had earlier lost from the Cuttack seat in 2004, is conducting a hectic campaign highlighting on the failures of the BJD and its former ally.         
	The Congress had lost from the seat in the past five elections. The break up in the BJD-BJP alliance had triggered chances of Congress winning the Barabati (Cuttack) seat in the event of a triangular fight.         
	Ahmed who was elected from the city in 1985 and 1990 on a Janata Dal ticket, had lost in 1995.         
	He left the BJD and had joined the Congress after it struck an alliance with the BJP in 1998. In 2000, he lost from the seat on a Congress ticket. He, however, returned to the BJD last month after the break up in the BJD-BJP alliance. The BJD is relying on Ahmed to make a dent in the Congress vote bank.

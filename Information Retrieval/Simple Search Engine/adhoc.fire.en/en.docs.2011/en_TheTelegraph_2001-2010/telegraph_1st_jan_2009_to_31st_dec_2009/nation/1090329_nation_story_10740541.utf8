The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Left waits for minority nod
                                                                                                               Left waits for minority nod
          CITHARA PAUL                               
	New Delhi, March 28: The Left is staring at the possibility of winning fewer seats in 2009 than it did in 2004, but it seems to have won the support of Muslim parties ahead of the general election.        
	The Jamaat-e-Islami Hind, Majlis-e-Mushawarat, Milli Council, Ulema Council and the Muslim Political Council are planning to issue a joint declaration supporting the Left in these elections.         
	Muslims in the country are convinced there should be a substantial presence of the Left in the next Parliament and we will ensure that it happens, said S.Q.R. Illyas of the Jamaat. Adequate presence of the Left is essential to check and balance the system.         
	The Jamaat  seen as the ideological face of Indian Muslims  is canvassing for the Left among the Muslim organisations. We are in touch with all other Muslim organisations and there will be a public announcement shortly, Illyas said.         
	Left leaders, including CPM general secretary Prakash Karat and CPI chief A.B. Bardhan, have held several rounds of discussions with the Jamaat. The next meeting scheduled is with the CPMs Bengal state secretary, Biman Bose, the Jamaat leader said.         
	If the appeal does come, this will be the first time that major Muslim organisations openly declare their support for the Left in a national election. Groups such as the Jamaat and the PDP have in the past offered support to the Left in states like Kerala.         
	Muslims have lost their faith in the Congress and they have never trusted the BJP. The third front is the only alternative, said T.A. Rehmani of the Ulema Council.         
	However, the Jamait Ulema-e-Hind, an equally influential Muslim organisation, has not said yes to the move yet. We will announce our decision by the weekend, said Imanulla Sadat of the Jamait.         
	In Bengal, Jamaat leader Maulana Siddiqullah Chaudhry is against the move.

                                                                                                               Careless docs get a rap
                            
	New Delhi, May 29: The Supreme Court today lamented the declining standards of medical practice and refused to reduce the compensation to be paid by a surgeon for leaving an orthopaedic plate loose inside a patient.         
	Nowadays, you only get these sort of doctors. They leave cotton or scissors or scalpel within a patients body and stitch him up. Only when the patients start complaining of pain six months later they realise they have left something behind inside his body, a two-judge bench observed.        
	Doctor Mahendra Prasad had left the plates loose inside Pintoo Kumars body. He found out the problem after months of pain following the surgery.

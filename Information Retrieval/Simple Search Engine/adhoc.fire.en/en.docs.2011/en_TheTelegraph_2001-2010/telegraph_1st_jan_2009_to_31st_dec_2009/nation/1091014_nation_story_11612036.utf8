	Patna, Oct. 13: Stung by the Union governments proposed offensive to curb their activities, Maoists today blew up railway tracks, vandalised a station and torched public buildings and cellphone towers at various places across central, south and south-eastern Bihar.        
	Over 100 alleged CPI (Maoist) rebels raided the Banshipur railway station on Kiul-Jhajha section of East Central Railway around 12 midnight, setting its cabin room on fire and held several railway staff hostage for four hours. They also damaged the signal system and burnt many records.        
	They vandalised the railway station, leading to disruption of train services for six hours till 6am today on the crucial New Delhi-Howrah route. The incident took place near Lakhisarai railway station, which has been a venue of repeated attacks on railway establishments on the Howrah-New Delhi routes for years.        
	Superintendent of police (railway) Bimal Kumar said that the security forces swung into action, chasing out the rebels and restoring order at the railway station by this morning. But hundreds of passengers stuck up in Up and Down trains, which were stranded for hours. However, the rebels did not hurt any of the passengers.        
	Inspector-general of police (operations) K.S. Dwivedi said that security had been stepped up along the tracks to prevent the Maoist invasion. The state government has withdrawn its move to send security personnel from Bihar to Maharashtra for poll purpose and four additional battalions have been deployed in the Naxalite-hit areas, he said.         
	The rebels also blew up a small stretch of track at Simultala in Jamui district. The railway officials, however, said that the tracks were repaired soon and the trains were being run there.         
	The Maoists also blasted the block office of Sangrampur in south Bihars rebel-hit Aurangabad district. The officer in charge of Sangrampur police station, Kishore Kumar, said that a portion of the block office was razed to the ground. They also blew up a mobile tower at Pararia village in the district.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, May 30: The culture ministry hasnt got a minister yet, but the secretary in the department has been given additional charge of information and broadcasting.        
	Sources say Bengal-cadre officer Jawhar Sircar is likely to be shifted to I amp;B eventually. Ive been told to hold charge of the culture ministry for some more time, Sircar said.        
	Ambika Soni, who earlier headed tourism and culture, has been promoted to cabinet minister and allocated I amp;B. Tourism has been given to Kumari Selja but not culture.        
	But the culture ministry, with over 45 autonomous bodies like the Archaeological Survey of India under it, is too important to be left without a minister for long. Many foreign missions across the world are also under its jurisdiction.         
	There is speculation that Soni is likely to get charge of culture as well.

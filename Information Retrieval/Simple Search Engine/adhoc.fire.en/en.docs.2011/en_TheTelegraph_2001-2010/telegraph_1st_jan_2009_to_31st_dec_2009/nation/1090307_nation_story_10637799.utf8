	Bangalore, March 6: A prototype of Saras, Indias first indigenously designed civilian plane, crashed during a test sortie today, killing two Wing Commanders and a Squadron Leader.        
	The crash of the 14-seater plane near Bangalore marks another setback to the project after the first prototype was found overweight. It was a regular test sortie but something happened, Saras director M.S. Chidananda said.        
	The project began in the early 1990s. The IAF is to buy the planes.

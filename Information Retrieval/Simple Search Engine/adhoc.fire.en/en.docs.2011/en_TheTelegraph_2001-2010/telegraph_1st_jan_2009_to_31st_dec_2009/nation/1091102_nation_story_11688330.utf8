	Washington, Nov. 1 (PTI): US national David Coleman Headley, nabbed by the FBI for plotting a terror attack in India at the Lashkar-e-Toibas behest, was a frequent flyer who made multiple trips to Pakistan, American investigators have said.        
	The investigators have further said Headley spent substantial time undergoing training from the terror group in Pakistan.        
	Headley, 49, was arrested on October 3 along with Tahawwur Hussain Rana, 48, a Canadian citizen of Pakistani origin, by the FBI at Chicagos Hare International Airport as he prepared to board a flight to Philadelphia, on way to Pakistan.        
	According to the affidavit submitted by the FBI to the US district court of Illinois, Headley, alias Daood Gilani, at times had claimed to be a consultant with or representative of First World Immigration Services, a company owned and operated by Rana.        
	Surveillance of Headleys activities as well as his phone conversations and e-mail exchanges reflects that he performed few services for First World.        
	Headley has no known or reported employment other than with First World. His residence in Chicago is an apartment leased to an individual who is deceased, the affidavit says.        
	Notwithstanding his apparent lack of financial resources and substantial employment, Headley has engaged in extensive international travel since the second half of 2008, including multiple trips to Pakistan and various countries in Europe, it says.        
	Records reflecting the locations of Internet protocol addresses used by Headley, who changed his name to Daood Gilani in 2006, to send e-mails indicate that he had spent substantial time in Pakistan and elsewhere during the last several years  often for months at a time, the affidavit says.        
	For example, records of e-mail accounts used by Headley reflect that between August 2008 and December 7, 2008, he sent multiple e-mail messages from Internet addresses located in Karachi and Lahore.        
	Again, between late January and early March, 2009, he sent multiple e-mail messages from Pakistan,        
	The affidavit says on January 24, 2009, Headley left for Pakistan via Frankfurt, Germany, and the United Arab Emirates.

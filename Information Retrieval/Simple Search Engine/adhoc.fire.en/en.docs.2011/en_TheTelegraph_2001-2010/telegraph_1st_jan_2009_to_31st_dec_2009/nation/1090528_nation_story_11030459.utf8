	Mumbai, May 27: If the city cops needed a leg-up, this is it.        
	The panel probing the response of Mumbai police to the November attacks was expected to find lapses and fix responsibility, but it had nothing but praise for the men who took on Ajmal Kasab and his terrorist band.        
	Former Arunachal Pradesh governor Ram Padhan, who headed the two-member committee set up in December, said they found the state police had received no direct information about the attack from the Centre.        
	We have praised the way young officers handled the situation with bravery. We felt that no police department can handle a war-like situation prevalent on the day of the attacks. What Mumbai police did was worthy of praise.        
	Pradhan, who probed the police response along with former RAW officer V. Balachandran, handed their 100-page report to Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan today.        
	The former bureaucrat, who played a key role in the signing of the Assam, Mizoram and Punjab accords as home secretary to Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, said they visited all the attack sites, went through 5,000 logs at the police control room and interviewed over 50 officers.        
	But he added that their probe was not a judicial inquiry but an administrative one. There was a lot of information that was sub judice, and we could not access that, Pradhan said.        
	He refused to answer specific queries on whether their probe had fixed responsibility for the security lapses on IAS and IPS officials who supervised the response to the attacks. Whatever we have to say is in the report, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Gadkaris headache
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Gadkaris headache
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 23: Nitin Gadkaris political understanding and skills were put to test as he chaired his first meeting of the parliamentary board as BJP president shortly after the Jharkhand verdict was out.        
	The 11-member board that includes L.K. Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi authorised Gadkari to take an appropriate decision at an appropriate time.        
	Despite the admission the results were way below the BJPs expectations  it dropped 16 seats since 2005  Ananth Kumar, general secretary and parliamentary board spokesperson, indicated it might take a shot at government formation.         
	We are not ruling out anything, he said. Another senior leader later said the party would make a bid for power until all options were exhausted.        
	The late-evening response was in contrast with the reaction in the morning when results started trickling in. Once the early trends established the BJP would not come anywhere close to 30, most leaders felt it should sit in the Opposition rather than mess around with small players and strike extravagant bargains.        
	But by evening, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) had established itself as the pivot for a prospective coalition arrangement. The BJP reckoned that on the face of it, it was impossible that two competing tribal leaders  Babulal Marandi and Shibu Soren  could co-exist in the same political structure being planned by the Congress.        
	Marandi was a pre-poll ally of the Congress and a BJP leader wondered if he would forfeit his claim to the chief ministers chair and make way for Soren. Unless the Congress gives him a berth at the Centre, Marandi will not relent, a BJP leader said.        
	The BJP leader said his party would have fewer problems making Soren chief minister, knowing fully well we will have to play second fiddle to him.        
	But another source pointed out that all these theories are in the realm of speculation as Soren has yet to reveal his cards. The bottomline is we cannot move a centimetre unless we know what he wants, the source said, adding that some state leaders were informally in touch with the JMM.        
	Gadkari, who has never dealt with politics outside his home state Maharashtra, was closeted for much of the day with Advani, M. Venkaiah Naidu, Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj and Rajnath Singh.         
	Based on the inputs, one view was it might cost the BJP dear to play the first shot in a perilous game involving the JMM  a party that has a record of being unreliable.        
	In 2005, we jumped to put a government in place. Despite our numbers being much more then, the government fell in less than two years. After that, the Congress stepped in and ensured some kind of stability for the next three years. Some of us feel that if we let the Congress have the first shy at stitching up a coalition and if that falls, we should step in and form an alternative arrangement. Mid-way through a five-year tenure, no MLA would want an election so we can see to it that the coalition somehow lasts its tenure, said a BJP functionary.        
	The other view is that with the BJPs morale crushed after back-to-back electoral reverses, a government and the sense of being in power might give some hope to the cadres.

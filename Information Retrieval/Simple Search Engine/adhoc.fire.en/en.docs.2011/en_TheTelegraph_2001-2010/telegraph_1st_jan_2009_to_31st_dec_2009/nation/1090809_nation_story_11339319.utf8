The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | IIT shot at cutting solar energy cost
                                                                                                               IIT shot at cutting solar energy cost
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	Lucknow, Aug. 8: Scientists at IIT Kanpur plan to set up a 500kW solar plant at the institute and focus on research aimed at reducing the price gap between solar power and energy from conventional sources.         
	When complete, the Rs 18-crore project  launched today on a small plot on the campus to coincide with the premier tech schools 50th-year celebrations  plans to supply free energy to six neighbouring villages.         
	The foundation ceremony came two days after the Union government told Parliament that the Prime Ministers Council on Climate Change had given in-principle approval to the National Solar Missions proposal to achieve a target of producing 20,000MW of solar power by 2020.         
	IIT director Sanjay Dhande said a project report had been prepared and work on the plant, the Solar Energy Research and Experimental Station, would begin in December.         
	If we are successful in providing solar power cheap within the next four years, it will be a breakthrough globally as this has been achieved by no other country as yet, Dhande said.         
	Solar power in India currently costs about Rs 15 per kWh (kilo Watt hour), compared with an average of Rs 3.50 per kWh for electricity from the national grid largely produced by coal-fired thermal power plants.         
	The real problem of making solar power popular is its high cost of production, said the IITs deputy director, R.K. Thareja. We are trying to make the research interdisciplinary involving the biotechnology and electrical departments. Suggestions on how to reduce costs have already come in from many scientists. We have to work on them, Thareja added.         
	The plan also involves building a productive relationship with industry for wider  and cheaper  production of solar power.         
	The Uttar Pradesh government had taken an early lead in the nineties to encourage use of solar energy in the state and had launched a scheme in 1992. But the project came unstuck.         
	Last year, the state government came up with a plan to subsidise installation of flat plates and vacuum tubes, instruments to tap solar power, in homes. The plan was to install the instruments for Rs 12,000, half the cost it takes.         
	The government organised a solar expo in October and offered the scheme to 1,000 house owners on a first-come-first-serve basis. Officials with the states Nonconventional Energy Development Agency said only 400 house owners had responded to the offer so far.         
	The state is, however, planning to launch a fresh scheme to let all multi-storey buildings in major cities to set up Solar Water Heaters at a reasonably low cost.         
	We are looking forward to IIT Kanpurs low-cost technology, said an official with the non-conventional energy department.         
	Recently, the Gujarat government had signed a memorandum of understanding for a solar park with a capacity to generate more than 5,000MW, state energy minister Saurabh Patel had told reporters.         
	India should forge ahead on solar technology instead of nuclear energy as this has a greater viability, said Ramesh Srivastava, a scientist with Lucknow University.         
	Among the guests at IIT Kanpur, which wore a festive look today, was Infosys chief mentor N.R. Narayana Murthy.         
	The IIT-K alumnus called for autonomy for the institutes in academic and financial issues. The government should not interfere in decisions taken by the board of governors in IITs regarding fee structure, pay scales and research funds, PTI quoted him as saying.         
	He also said though the country had made rapid strides in the technology sector, a lot more needed to be done if the IITs had to raise their standard of research to that of premier technological institutes in America.

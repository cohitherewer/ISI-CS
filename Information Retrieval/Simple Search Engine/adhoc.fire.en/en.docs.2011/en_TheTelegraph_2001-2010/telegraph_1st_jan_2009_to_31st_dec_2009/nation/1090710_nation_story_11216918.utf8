          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, July 9: Two sisters allegedly burnt alive their mother and brother in north Bihars Darbhanga district headquarters, 135km from Patna, yesterday night.         
	Police recovered the bodies of Sunita Devi, 40, and Mukesh Kumar, 22, charred beyond recognition from their house, which was still burning around 5am in a village under Darbhanga town police station area.         
	The neighbours first spotted the flames around 4am and informed the fire department. By the time the fire was controlled, both the mother and the son had died, said the station house officer at Darbhanga police station, Bipin Kumar.        
	Traces of kerosene were found in the room from where the bodies were recovered and main entrance of the house was also locked from outside, he said.        
	Kumar said the investigating officers have detained Madhu, 19, and Mala, 16.         
	Madhu and Mala have confessed to their crime and have said that they set the room in which their mother and brother were sleeping on fire late last night, he said.         
	Police added that Mukesh was a student of biotechnology at a Raigarh institute in Uttar Pradesh and had recently come home from vacations.         
	In their statements, Madhu and Mala have confessed that they were often tortured by their brother, and mother Sunita would side with Mukesh when such tortures would occur.         
	Yesterday Mukesh allegedly barged into their home in the evening carrying a burning piece of wood and threatened to burn both Madhu and Mala.         
	At the end of the day, we could not take it (the torture) any longer and planned to set the room in which Sunita Devi and Mukesh were sleeping on fire. We did so after midnight, Madhu said.         
	Police, however, are dealing cautiously with the double murder.         
	It may not be a simple case at al land other people may have connived with Madhu and Mala, said the investigating officer, adding: It is not yet clear why Mukesh was so furious with his sisters.        
	We are investigating the case keeping many angles in mind. It appears to be complex case, said a senior police officer at Darbhanga, adding: We will furnish the details only when some clues are found. The police reached the spot after the neighbours raised the alarm after spotting smoke and flames from the house.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | She came to my annaprashan
                                                                                                               She came to my annaprashan
                            
	Writer Nabanita Dev Sen remembers Kamala Das         
	I am deeply hurt by the news of her death. Kamala Das was a wonderful woman, very warm and sweet. Her mother Balamani Amma and my mother Radharani Debi were very good friends. Both of them were poets. That must be about 70 years ago. They used to live in Deshapriya Park then.         
	Kamala had come to my rice-eating ceremony (annaprashan) with her mother. She was a little girl then. I came to know about it in the 90s when I had gone for a conference in Kerala, which was attended by Balamani Amma too. When Balamani Amma heard my name, she told me she knew a certain Nabanita in Calcutta who was Radharani Debis daughter. I told her it was me. She was thrilled.         
	Later, Kamala became a friend of my elder daughter Antara. She would write for The Little Magazine which is run by Antara. Kamala was given the Little Magazine South Asian Literary Awards for the Masters for fiction. I last met Kamala in Delhi a couple of years ago. She was in a wheelchair but she was as charming and beautiful as ever.        
	Kamala was a very good writer. She was the first woman poet we knew who wrote in English. She wrote some beautiful short prose and the sense of humour in her prose was very special. Her journalistic writing was fabulous too.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Flu fright smothers Haj warmth: Dont hug 
                                                                                                               Flu fright smothers Haj warmth: Dont hug 
          JAYANTH JACOB                                      
	New Delhi, Oct. 5: Indians going on Haj this time should avoid hugging or shaking hands with pilgrims from other countries to ward off swine flu, according to a health ministry advisory.        
	Do not shake hands or hug in greetings, except as a mandatory religious activity of the Haj, says the advisory which also lists other dos and donts for the pilgrims.         
	The first batch from India is scheduled to leave on October 19. The Haj season will continue till January.        
	They advisory may end up robbing the Haj of its customary warmth, marked by hugs, handshakes and other forms of greetings, but officials say the restrictions are necessary because physical contact is one of the ways in which the virus spreads.        
	The Centre has already made it compulsory for all pilgrims to have valid flu vaccination certificates. State Haj committees have been informed about the rule.         
	Saudi Arabia had issued its own advisory earlier saying the pilgrims be vaccinated at least two weeks before leaving their countries.        
	The Saudi advisory had also suggested that the elderly, pregnant women, people with chronic diseases and children postpone the Haj this year for their safety. Indian Haj committees are following most of the guidelines but not strictly adhering to the suggestion that the elderly and children be kept out.         
	The Indian quota for this years Haj is around 1.6 lakh 1.15 lakh through the Haj Committee of India and 45,491 through private tour operators. In all, 17.29 lakh people from across the world went on the pilgrimage in 2008.        
	The Indian advisory has been welcomed by Muslim organisations, but the Bengal government feels it has come too late and shows the Centre wields too much power over the pilgrimage.        
	Extending handshakes and the hugs are the way we greet people. But if the authorities are restricting it on health grounds, no one should have a problem. These greetings are not strictly religious rituals, said S. Q.R. Ilyas, spokesperson for the All India Muslim Personal Law Board.        
	But Kozhikode trader Abdul Rahman Haji pointed out that greeting and mixing with people from other countries was a key feature of the pilgrimage. The warmth of the Haj also includes people from all the world expressing their brotherhood and affection while performing the Haj.        
	The reservations of Bengal, which will send 8,000 pilgrims, were voiced by Abdus Sattar, the minister for minorities development and chairman of state Haj committee. Most people going from the state are poor and come from different backgrounds. Teaching them about flu awareness and telling them to stay away from greeting others are not easy. The Centre should be telling us all this in advance rather than waiting for the last moment.        
	Other than the administrative and practical problems in following the guidelines, Sattar was upset with what he said was the over-centralisation of Haj planning. If so much power is concentrated in the Centre (the Haj Committee of India), why do we have state committees? he asked.

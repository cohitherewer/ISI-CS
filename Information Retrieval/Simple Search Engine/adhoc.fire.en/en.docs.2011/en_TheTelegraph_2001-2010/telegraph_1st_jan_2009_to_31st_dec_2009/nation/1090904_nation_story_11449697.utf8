          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Sept. 3: A Bihar court has asked chief minister Nitish Kumar to appear before it on September 9 in connection with his alleged involvement in the murder of a Congress activist in November 1991.        
	The summons prompted rival Lalu Prasad to demand his resignation. Nitish has been summoned on a murder case and should immediately resign, the RJD chief said, alleging that the chief minister had concealed the matter while submitting his affidavit before the polls.        
	Additional chief judicial magistrate Ranjan Kumar issued the order on September 1, asking Nitish and LJP legislator Dularchand Yadav to appear before the court for the hearing of a petition. The petition was filed by Ashok Singh, a relative of Sitaram Singh who was killed in a firing at a polling station of Barh Lok Sabha seat in November 1991.        
	Nitish contested and won the poll as a Dal (U) nominee. Nitish, Lalu Prasad and Dularchand were in the same party then.        
	Sitarams relatives had earlier named Nitish and others in the case, but the prosecution had given them a clean chit after no evidence was found against them.        
	George summoned        
	A court today summoned Janata Dal (United) Rajya Sabha MP George Fernandes to appear before it on November 3 in connection with a case related to violation of the election model code, a PTI report said.         
	The Muzaffarpur district administration had filed an FIR against Fernandes, accusing him of moving in a convoy of vehicles just before the Lok Sabha polls.

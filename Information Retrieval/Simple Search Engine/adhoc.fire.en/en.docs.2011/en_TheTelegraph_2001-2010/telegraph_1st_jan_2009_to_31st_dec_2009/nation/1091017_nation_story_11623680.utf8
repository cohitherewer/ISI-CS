          SHEENA K.                               
	Raipur, Oct. 16: When fireworks light up the night sky tomorrow, jawans posted in Maoist dens will not look up to see the show.        
	After all, the sound and light of crackers can provide an effective cover to rebels wanting to attack security camps in Bastars interiors. Therefore, police headquarters has issued guidelines asking officers and jawans in Maoist dens to exercise maximum precaution while celebrating the festival of lights, particularly while bursting crackers in and around police stations and camps.        
	Officers are wary because Maoists have been put under pressure by personnel who are drawing an action-plan for a major offensive after Diwali. At present, more than 18,000 jawans belonging to paramilitary forces are camping in Bastar  the worst hit Maoist pocket. Besides, the elite Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (Cobra) of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), battalions of Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) and Border Security Force (BSF) are also deployed in Bastar.        
	According to sources, jawans have been asked to keep to themselves and if possible away from any firecracker show, as the crackers, the top brass believe, could divert jawans attention giving room to rebels for an offensive.        
	Officers and jawans on duty have been asked to celebrate the festival by lighting a candle for peace, said inspector-general of police (headquarters) R.K. Vij.         
	Security personnel have been asked to avoid crackers that create too much noise.         
	A thick security blanket has been thrown open in the interiors along with intensified patrolling in most of the forested areas.

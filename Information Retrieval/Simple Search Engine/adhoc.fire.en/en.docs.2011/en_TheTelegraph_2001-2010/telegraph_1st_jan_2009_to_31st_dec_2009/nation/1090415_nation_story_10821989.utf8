          SHEENA K.                               
	Korba (Chhattisgarh), April 14: With Atal Bihari Vajpayee missing from the poll arena, his niece is feeling the heat.        
	Karuna Shukla, the niece of the former Prime Minister, is facing a tough fight in Korba Lok Sabha constituency in Chhattisgarh. Korba goes to polls, along with 10 constituencies, on Thursday.        
	Among all of Vajpayees relatives, only three are associated with politics. While Karuna has been in national politics after serving as the national chairperson of BJPs women cell, Vajpayees nephew Anoop Mishra is a BJP MLA and minister in Madhya Pradesh. Yet another nephew, Deepak Vajpayee, is a BJP official in Gwalior (Madhya Pradesh).         
	With Vajpayee slowly withdrawing himself from party affairs, it is Shukla who is the face of the family at the national level. But, the niece is struggling to survive. For now, Congress has pitted its former state president Charandas Mahant against her.         
	When she contested last time from Janjgir, Vajpayee travelled twice to the state to address election meetings. She won the election comfortably. It is not me, but the entire BJP family is missing Vajpayeeji, said Karuna.         
	Shukla adds that she climbed the stairs of politics holding Vajpayees hands and hence his absence was a personal loss. The missing uncle has been a double blow as Karuna was also denied a party ticket from Bilaspur (in which she was interested) and was offered Korna instead.

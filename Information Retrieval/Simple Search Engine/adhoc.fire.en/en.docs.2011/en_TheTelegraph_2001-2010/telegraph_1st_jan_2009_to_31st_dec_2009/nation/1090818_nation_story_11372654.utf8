The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pak 9 caught in sea breach
                                                                                                               Pak 9 caught in sea breach
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Ahmedabad, Aug. 17: The Border Security Force has arrested nine Pakistanis and seized the small boat in which they had entered Indian territory up Sir Creek off the west coast of Gujarat.        
	The BSF said it had advance intelligence inputs about the Pakistani boat. The Pakistanis, who claimed they were fishermen, have been handed over to the police for interrogation.        
	Arun Kumar Sinha, inspector-general (Gujarat frontier), said preliminary investigation showed that six of those arrested were fishing while three were not.        
	This is a rough-weather time... generally people do not venture into this area, PTI quoted Sinha as saying.        
	The arrests come on a day Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said intelligence inputs suggested more 26/11-type attacks on India launched from Pakistan.        
	The BSF said its suspicions were raised when the nine Pakistanis claimed they had been fishing in the sea for three days, yet had not a single catch in the boat to show for it.         
	At least six of them are from Balochistan  someone from that region is rarely a fisherman  which is why we are doubting them, said the BSF spokesman, who did not wish to be named.        
	Some of them could have been on their way to infiltrate into India through the sea.        
	Kutch superintendent of police Wabang Jamir said interrogation of the nine, who are being held at Dayapar police station, was yet to begin.        
	We have just got their custody, and according to the local police all the nine Pakistanis appear to be fishermen, Jamir said.        
	Sir Creek is a 96km strip of water in the Rann of Kutch marshlands and figures in the list of disputed territories between India and Pakistan. It divides Gujarats Kutch region from Pakistans Sindh province.        
	The BSF appears to be especially wary since the 26/11 gunmen had hijacked a boat, MV Kuber, near the Sir Creek marshlands and travelled to Mumbai to carry out the attacks. The 10 Pakistani gunmen had earlier set out from Karachi in a Pakistani vessel.

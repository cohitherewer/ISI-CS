The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | IIM rethink on mentor role
                                                                                                               IIM rethink on mentor role
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, March 21: The IIMs are reconsidering their opposition to mentoring new business schools after reassurances from the human resource development ministry that they will not need to divert their resources for the hand-holding exercise.         
	The HRD ministry may soon call a meeting of the directors of the six older IIMs to work out the details of an agreement with the institutes for the mentoring project, top government and institute sources have said.         
	There were specific concerns behind our refusal to mentor new IIMs. The HRD ministry is suggesting that it can address these concerns. If that happens, there is no reason why we cannot mentor the new institutes, an IIM director said.        
	If the IIMs agree to mentor the new breed that will share their brand, it will expedite the kick-starting of the new IIMs.         
	The concerns of the IIMs stem from the experience of the older IITs in mentoring the new tech schools promised under the XIth Plan.         
	The seven older IITs have had to mentor eight new IITs between them  IIT Bombay is mentoring two IITs, in Indore and in Gandhinagar.         
	The mentor IITs are expected to hand-hold the new institutions through their initial years, like many of them were assisted by foreign institutions in the 1950s.         
	The mentors are expected to help draft the curriculum, course structures and teaching methodology. But over the past year, the mentor IITs have had to send their teachers to teach students at the new institutes as they struggled to hire quality faculty.         
	In the case of at least three mentors, the older IITs have had to loan funds to their mentored institutions as the government could not release the required money in time. IIT Delhi, at its last board of governors meeting, formally passed a resolution to grant loans to IIT Punjab.         
	The IIMs, sources said, do not want to run the risk of having to spend their funds for the new institutes.         
	The premier B-schools are already at loggerheads with the Centre over the pay scales provided to their teachers which they argue are too low to retain faculty members who the private sector is trying to poach. We can ill afford overworking our faculty... their working conditions are the only thing keeping them at the IIMs, an institute administrator said.         
	These concerns drove the IIMs to reject pleas to mentor the new institutes from both the HRD ministry and a government panel under former Maruti boss R.C. Bhargava reviewing the B-schools.         
	But the ministry is learnt to have communicated to the IIMs that they will not need to divert funds or faculty members for the new institutions. Their mandate will be restricted to overseeing the early development of the new institutes, a ministry official said.         
	Of the seven new IIMs promised last year, one has started functioning in Shillong.

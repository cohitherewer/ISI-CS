The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Advani reaches out in Urdu
                                                                                                               Advani reaches out in Urdu
          SANJAY K. JHA                          Advani: Babri regrets                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 22: L.K. Advani is casting his web wider than the Sangh parivar would have imagined  the latest addition to his website is the chapter Know LK Advani in Urdu.        
	This chapter contains excerpts from his autobiography My Country My Life and has Advani expressing regret over the Babri Masjid demolition.         
	As he had written in his autobiography, the Urdu chapter on his portal says the mosque should not have been demolished and that a temple should be constructed at the site only by mutual compromise.         
	Some BJP leaders argued that the use of Urdu should not be taken as an attempt to reach out to Muslims, saying language is not restricted to religion. Others, however, said the party could not ignore the community, which forms a sizeable part of the electorate.        
	Advani, who is the BJPs candidate for Prime Minister, wants to tell the Muslims he was not in favour of pulling down the Babri Masjid even though he was the chief architect of the Ayodhya movement.         
	His attempt to reach out to the Muslims is being seen in the light of Atal Bihari Vajpayees success in generating some goodwill in the community.         
	A small group of Muslim intellectuals had formed a Himayat committee to support Vajpayee just before the 2004 general election. Though the exercise evoked ridicule from the community, it did send out a message that a section of Muslims supported Vajpayees moderate politics.         
	The Himayat committee campaigned for Vajpayee in his constituency Lucknow. Posters were printed in Urdu and campaign vehicles painted green. But this put off Hindutva hardliners.         
	Advani, however, is determined to pursue this course. His autobiography, printed in many languages including Tamil and Kannad, will now come out in Urdu, too.

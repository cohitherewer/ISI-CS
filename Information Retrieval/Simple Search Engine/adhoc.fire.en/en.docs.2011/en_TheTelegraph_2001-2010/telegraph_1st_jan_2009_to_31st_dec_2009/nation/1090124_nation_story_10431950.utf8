	Cuttack, Jan. 23: Political parties are yet to overcome the dissident crisis even after the last day of withdrawing nomination for Cuttack Municipal Corporation polls expired yesterday.        
	While 35 of the 45 dissident candidates withdrew their nominations, the BJD leadership is still under pressure with five of its rebel members refusing to listen to the high command. But BJD rebel candidate Bijay Kumar Behera withdrew his nomination from ward No. 9 after being given charge of the partys youth and students wing in the district. Senior BJD leaders were apparently keen to clear the way for party candidate Kshirod Behera, a relative of partys district president Dharmananda Behera.        
	Four rebel members of BJP did not withdraw nominations even after much prodding. Foremost among those who withdrew their nomination papers include former mayor Nibedita Pradhan of the BJP. She reportedly withdrew her nomination for ward No. 21 after ensuring that the name of the party candidate was changed in favour of a candidate of her choice. I had to ensure the party identifies a suitable replacement for the ward, she said.        
	Congress candidate from ward No. 2 Giribala Behera and BJD candidate from ward No. 14 A. Ahalya have been restrained from using party symbols after scrutiny of their nomination papers and assigned ladder and top symbols, respectively, by the election officer.

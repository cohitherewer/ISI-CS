  Blast marks out Maoist amp; forces turf           SUJAN DUTTA                          Jawans march on the road to Lalgarh police station. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha                                        
	Pingboni, on the road to Lalgarh, June 22: The T-shirt and lungi covered a frail frame but the voice was firm: just get out of here quietly, without fuss, it said.        
	The village was deceptively desolate. Pingboni is a different kind of frontier in this battle for Lalgarh today. Forget the concept of guerrilla zones and mobile warfare  the staple diet of Bengals instant strategists in the current operations.        
	Here this afternoon and over the last four days, the rebels and the security forces have their areas marked out. Here, the police and the paramilitary have not advanced beyond half this village. On the only occasion they dared  the day before yesterday  the rebels set off a landmine blast and fired on the forces from three sides near Kadashole village, about three kilometres up the road towards Ramgarh and to the south.        
	Pingboni is on the road from Goaltore to Ramgarh which is to the north of Lalgarh. The security forces have cut an east-west axis through Pirakata to the Lalgarh police station. But the crucial link from Lalgarh police station to Ramgarh that passes through Barapelia is unpatrolled and till now beyond the access of the state.        
	A big reason for this is that the forces stationed in Goaltore that were to have advanced through Pingboni to Ramgarh have not been able to move. The distance from Goaltore to Pingboni is a mere four kilometres. The distance from Pingboni to Ramgarh is another 11.        
	Half a kilometre from Pingboni is the bridge on the river Kubai. The security forces were to set up a camp on the other side of the Kubai.        
	They have not yet been able to go past Pingboni. Kubai is beyond the village.        
	The Kubai is really a rivulet. But it cuts into the earth and its grassy flanks are ravine-like enough to offer concealment. This is the area around the Kadashole village where the only attempt to advance by the security forces was thwarted. The forces have since gone back to camp in Goaltore. Over the last three days, patrols have ventured out. Someday, with a larger force and with a confidence that they have to renew, they will have to push ahead.        
	This frontier exists today and has held for the last four days, but it cannot remain. Pingboni is almost emptied of its inhabitants. They are trickling in as refugees in a camp opened by block development officer Sharmistha Guha Roy in Goaltore.        
	An India Reserve Battalion camp is being set up in the centre of the village. But the far end is watched by the rebels  they may be Maoists, or maybe from the Peoples Committee against Police Atrocities.         
	The man in the T-shirt and lungi was one of them. The road beyond is dug up. Who knows if it is mined.        
	I wanted to leave but my old parents are too weak and it is so hot, I am not sure if they can stand the trudge, says the only youth who dares venture out into the street. Everyone has left, he points to the houses, locked and bolted.        
	Pingboni has about 350 households, he says. On its only main street, shops are shuttered. There is a lock on Ghosh Decorators. Ditto at Gandheshwari Bhandar, the grocery. The youth said many men from the village had fled into the Joddiya forest near the village when the police began pouring into Goaltore. We knew it. And the day before yesterday, after the firing near Kadashole, they barged into houses and beat us up, he says.        
	In Goaltore, BDO Guha Roy says most of the villages between Goaltore and Ramgarh have emptied. There has been an exodus. We spot vans ferrying people towards Midnapore. Vans with papers labelled rugi (patient) on their windshields.        
	Lalgarhs rebellion and the states counter-offensive has triggered an exodus across the zone. Most villagers of Dobati, Jirapara, Siyarbari, Shirishboni, Bandi, Mahalishai, Dumurdihai, Kakrishole, Bhedua, Dudhpatri, Kushtitora, Kodomdiha, Kadashole and Kernokani have turned refugees.        
	Guha Roy was by herself for four days in the BDO complex without any staff security. Today, she called a driver and sent a car to get her staff picked up from the Chandrakona Road crossing 19km away. Some of her staff inside the disturbed area are still unable to come.        
	In Goaltore and Midnapore, the administration is requisitioning school and college buildings in large numbers, an indication that there are more security forces coming in who have to be sheltered. It means a forced vacation for the staff and students of these institutions.        
	In Goaltore, the state armed police has set up camp in the Goaltore Santal Bidroha Shotobarshiki Mahavidyala. The forces are also stationed in Goaltore Boys and Goaltore Girls High Schools.         
	In Midnapore town, the district magistrate sent out notices to seven schools yesterday requisitioning them for the forces.

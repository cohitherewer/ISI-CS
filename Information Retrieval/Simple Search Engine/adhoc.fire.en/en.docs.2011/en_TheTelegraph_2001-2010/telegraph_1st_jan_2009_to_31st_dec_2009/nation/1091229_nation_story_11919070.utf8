	Lucknow, Dec. 28: Police have arrested a madrasah teacher in Muzaffarnagar on the suspicion that he sodomised and then throttled to death a 12-year-old boy who studied in the seminary.        
	The boys body was found yesterday in a pond at Bunta village in Muzaffarnagar district, 350km from Lucknow.        
	Police questioned 25-year-old Maulvi Shahzad, a teacher of the Abrar Uloom Madrasah, after being told that the child was last seen with him.        
	He confessed to killing the boy, the police said, adding that he told interrogators he had dumped the body in a field after throttling the boy. Shahzad has admitted to committing the crime. He told us that he throttled the boy on Sunday and later dumped his body in a field in Bunta village, police officer Yogesh Chaudhary said.        
	The police are probing if any other teacher or employee of the seminary played a role in the murder.        
	The madrasah has been sealed. The police have filed a murder case against Shahzad.        
	In May, a maulvi who taught in a Delhi madr- asah was arrested for allegedly sodomising a 10-year-old boy.         
	Mohammad Shehzad had started teaching in the madrasah of Kali Masjid at Hazrat Nizamuddin a month before he was caught. The Delhi boy had mustered the courage to tell his mother about the incident.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Groundwater floods desert city

  - Water level rises in Jodhpur when rest of India reports plunge           RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR                          The waterlogged basement of a building                                        
	Jaipur, Sept. 4: The groundwater level in Jodhpur in the heart of the Thar desert is rising at a time other parts of northern India are suffering from receding water levels.        
	The groundwater level in the Sun City, about 330km from Jaipur, is rising by up to 1.5 metres every year, posing a threat to the foundations of buildings. Residents say water seeps into basements, flooding them and have to be pumped out everyday.        
	A recent Nasa study showed that groundwater levels in Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana and the National Capital Region have been depleting by about a foot a year. Over the past six years (2002-2008), about 109 cubic km of ground water has depleted.         
	These revelations were published in the journal Nature based on a study by US hydrologist Matt Rodell.         
	The Nasa study says the depletion is around 20 per cent higher than previous estimates by Indian authorities.         
	Experts say though groundwater level in the Thar desert is declining at the rate of 3 to 4 metres annually in many places, Jodhpur faces the opposite problem.         
	Geologists say Jodhpur is made of volcanic rocks.         
	Bhawani Shankar Paliwal, former dean, faculty of science, and head of geology at Jai Narain Vyas University, Jodhpur, and who has studied the seepage, says several factors are pushing the water upwards. One, the city is set in a bowl-shaped terrain that draws recharge towards the city centre and creates shallow water tables.         
	The Indira Gandhi canal has also been channelling water to the city since 1997, reducing the need to draw groundwater. Leakage from local water supply sources also creates an additional source of groundwater recharge.         
	Paliwal also said since the city geologically has basement rock formed of rhyolite and does not have deep fractures or secondary permeability, water does not percolate to deep levels.         
	However, the eastern part of the city housing the majestic Mehrangarh Fort and Umaid Bhawan have their foundations on sandstone of Jodhpur group, hence they are safe from seepage.        
	The state government has sanctioned Rs 12 crore to stop seepage of groundwater.         
	One of the remedial measures suggested is using the excess water in gardens like Mandore, Umaid and Nehru parks under chief minister Ashok Gehlots Harit (Green) Rajasthan campaign.         
	The public works department has asked local community organisations to start planting water-absorbing and fast-growing plants like Eucalyptus and to increase water supply to the gardens.         
	In some parts of the city, the water is rising at an alarming rate of 2-3cm each week and in some other areas the level has reached the surface. The seepage started some years ago but became noticeable when water started seeping into the basements of houses.         
	M. Lalas, a resident of Laxmi Nagar in Paota area, says his basement always remains flooded. We have stopped using our basement. Most houses in the area use pumps on a daily basis otherwise we would be flooded, he said.

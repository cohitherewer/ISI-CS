          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Gafoor: U-turn                                   
	Mumbai, Feb. 12: Mumbai police commissioner Hassan Gafoor today admitted the involvement of Indians in the November 26 attack on the city and then flatly denied it, in the space of half an hour.         
	At the end of a four-hour meeting in which top Mumbai crime branch and anti-terrorist squad officials were huddled in the commissioners office, the involvement of Indians in the attack was acknowledged for the first time.        
	Gafoor said two Lashkar-e-Toiba men, arrested in Lucknow in February last year and now in Mumbai polices custody, had spilled the names of some Indians.        
	Sixteen people are wanted in this case. It includes both Pakistanis and Indians. The names have been provided to Pakistan. There was information from IB too regarding this. The names came up after the interrogation of Faheem and Sabauddin. At this point of time the locals would have crossed the border, he said.        
	Utter confusion followed. Crime branch officials investigating the case were cagey.         
	A top official of the anti-terror squad said: Faheem and Sabauddin have given a lot of information to the crime branch and six people are wanted. It has not been ascertained yet whether, apart from them, there were any Indians involved. The dossier prepared for the home ministry did not have any Indian names.        
	Faheem Ansari and Sabauddin Ahmed, both Indians, were arrested over the attack on a CRPF camp in Uttar Pradesh. They were brought to Mumbai in December for interrogation.        
	A crime branch officer said Faheem and Sabauddin have spilled names of people connected with various Lashkar attacks. Some Indian names are among them, but they were not involved in the 26/11 attacks. We are trying to find out whether any Indians were at all involved in initial recce operations or provided logistical support, the officer said.         
	Gafoor later retracted his statement. No Indian was involved as per information currently available to us. Evidence is against 18 people  9 Pakistanis killed in encounter, one in custody i.e Kasab, 6 wanted  all Pakistanis, and two Indians arrested, Faheem and Sabauddin. No Indians wanted, he said.        
	Police sources said the commissioner was asked by the home ministry to retract his statement. He was told that Parliament is in session and he cannot make statements. And that he should retract immediately, the crime branch officer said.        
	Gunmen identity        
	Pakistan interior ministry adviser Rehman Malik said one suspect was allegedly involved in the 2007 Samjhauta Express blast that killed 68 people. Arrested army officer, Lt Colonel Prasad Purohit, is accused of plotting the blast.

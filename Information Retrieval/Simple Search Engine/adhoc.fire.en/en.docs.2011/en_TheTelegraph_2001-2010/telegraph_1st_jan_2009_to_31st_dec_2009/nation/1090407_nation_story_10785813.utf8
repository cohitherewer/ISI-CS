          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, April 6: LJP boss Ram Vilas Paswan on Monday accused chief minister Nitish Kumar of weakening the Dalits with his divide and rule policy.         
	Addressing an election meeting in Wazirganj on behalf of RJD candidate Ramji Manjhi, Paswan said that by diving the Mahadalits from the Dalits, Nitish was doing the community disservice.         
	He added that some citizens who wished to maintain the status quo were being unnerved by the newly found power found by Dalits and were thus pitting one section against another. Paswan hoped that the Dalits would see through the game and remain united.         
	While seeking votes for RJD candidate Ramji Manjhi, Paswan also added that he wished to field LJP general secretary Sarvajeet Kumar from the Gaya seat, but gave up claim in the larger interest of the alliance. RJD chief Lalu Prasad, earlier scheduled to campaign jointly with Paswan, could not make it.         
	Manjhi attributed Lalus absence to his hectic campaign schedule.

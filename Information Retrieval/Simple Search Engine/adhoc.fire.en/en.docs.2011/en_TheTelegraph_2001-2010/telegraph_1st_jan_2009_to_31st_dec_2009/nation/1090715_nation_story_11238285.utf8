          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, July 14: Weather scientists today predicted widespread rainfall over the next two days across parts of northwest India where rainfall deficit has ranged from 65 per cent to 80 per cent since the start of the monsoon season six weeks ago.         
	Moisture-laden monsoon winds in central India and a low-pressure zone over the northwestern Bay of Bengal are likely to cause heavy rainfall across Orissa, southern Chhattisgarh and parts of central India, the India Meteorological Department said.         
	We see an interaction of the monsoon winds with the low pressure zone which is associated with increased rainfall activity, an IMD scientist said. The trough is also interacting with an elongated low atmospheric pressure zone in the north which is favourable for more rain in the northwest region.         
	Many places in Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and western Uttar Pradesh are likely to receive rain or thundershowers over the next 48 hours, the IMD said, raising hopes among agrometerologists that the rainfall deficits in these grain-growing zones would be reduced.         
	The low pressure zone in the Bay of Bengal would also have contributed to the heavy rainfall Mumbai experienced today. The low pressure zone draws winds towards it, and when winds from the Arabian Sea rush eastward, they strike the Western Ghats, bringing rain along Indias western coast.        
	Agricultural scientists have said crop output would depend much on the rainfall behaviour over the next two weeks.                     
	Any rain at this juncture would help a lot, said Ashok Singh, a crop scientist at the division of genetics at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi. The rainfall changes the microclimate, it increases the humidity, it takes away scorching heat, and improves soil moisture  its good for crops, Singh told The Telegraph.         
	Indias monsoon season is typically marked by intermittent wet and relatively dry spells. Crop scientists say fairly widespread rainfall can help farmers when it occurs after gaps of several days.         
	In its long range forecast issued last month, the IMD had said India would receive 93 per cent of average rainfall during the 2009 monsoon, and the northwest would experience a deficit of about 20 per cent. It also predicted that August would receive 100 per cent rainfall.

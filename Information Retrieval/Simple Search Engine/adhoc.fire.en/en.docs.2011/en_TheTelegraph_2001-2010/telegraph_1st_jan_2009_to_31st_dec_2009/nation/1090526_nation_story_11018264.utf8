	Cuttack, May 25: Mismanagement in utilisation of Calamity Relief Fund (CRF) has led to a shortage of powerboats in Orissa.         
	Powerboats form a critical plank in rescue operations during floods. As things stand today, 40 per cent of the states fleet of powerboats would not be available if there is a repeat of 2007 floods this year.         
	State Port Engineering Division (SPED) of the states special relief commissioners office manages all powerboats. Port engineer S.P. Chakravarti admitted to The Telegraph today that only 140 of the 234 powerboats could be pressed into service in course of a flood. While 61 have been declared condemned, 33 are under repair to be completed this year. But, a process has started to purchase 39 more boats. They would be procured in two months time, Chakravarti said.         
	The Orissa State Disaster Management Authority had provided 18 powerboats to SPED a year ago, procured at a cost of Rs 1.2 crore, along with accessories worth Rs Rs 25 lakh. We found that all 18 aluminium powerboats failed to start during trial runs in the Mahanadi and were found unsuitable for flood operations, complained a SPED source.         
	Later, the powerboats were included in a mock drill jointly organised by the state and National Disaster Rapid Action Force at Mundali.        
	But, officers reportedly declared the boats as unfit. In fact, the officers said the 18 boasts were suitable for smaller ponds and for tourism purposes, said a SPED officer on condition of anonymity.        
	Meanwhile, the state disaster authority has started the process to procure hundred powerboats at the cost of Rs 7 crore for fire stations that would be assisting the state during relief operations.         
	Earlier, 55 power-fibre boats were procured by special relief commissioner for SPED in 2001 at a cost of Rs 1 crore.

	Nov. 14: Former chief minister Madhu Koda today claimed he would quit politics if the money laundering charges against him were proved, adding that some political higher-ups were working against him.        
	I am very much aware that some political higher-ups are working against me. I shall expose them at an appropriate time, he said in Chaibasa.        
	Koda said that nothing had been found so far to prove the allegations of financial irregularities against him. They said I own a mine in Liberia and have bank accounts abroad. None of these charges have been proved. I will quit politics if these charges are proved.        
	He said he had been accused of distributing 500 bikes and 50 cars during the Lok Sabha polls. Where are those vehicles? he asked.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong guards on toes for born PM 
                                                                                                               Cong guards on toes for born PM 
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          SPG commandos at AIIMS on Saturday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 24: Hail, Pradhan Mantri, the born PM.        
	The Congresss chief spokesperson looked outraged when asked if the country had two Prime Ministers now that Manmohan Singh was in hospital, but to guards outside the partys 24 Akbar Road headquarters, the Pradhan Mantri was inside.        
	It meant journalists, who always drove into the complex without being questioned, were stopped at the gate and told to leave their cars outside.        
	Pradhan Mantri aaye hain (the Prime Minister has come), said a guard, referring to Pranab Mukherjee. Haan, haan, hamare Pranabda (yes, yes, our Pranabda), he added, as eyebrows went up.        
	In lighter moments, Mukherjee would allude to the initials in his name and say he didnt really need to become a Prime Minister because he was born a PM.        
	It is hard to tell whether the guards punned on the two letters or really took the foreign ministers amended status seriously.        
	M. Veerappa Moily, however, seemed almost annoyed when journalists badgered him with queries on whether Mukherjees de facto status as No. 2 in the government had become de jure  or according to the law  now that Singh was expected to be out of action for a while.        
	The question is most irrelevant, the chief spokesperson said, because under the Constitution there could not be two Prime Ministers.        
	Mukherjee began his day by accepting greetings from Congress workers and minor functionaries.         
	At 9.45, he drove to Rashtrapati Bhavan to receive Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev, a courtesy the Prime Minister would have extended. Since my Prime Minister is indisposed, I am receiving you, Mukherjee told the Kazakh leader.        
	He headed delegation-level talks with Kazakhstan in the presence of President Pratibha Patil.        
	If the Prime Minister was not in hospital, he would have presided over the talks at Hyderabad House instead of at Rashtrapati Bhavan.        
	Mukherjee also signed an extradition treaty with his Kazakh counterpart. Indias Nuclear Power Corporation and state-owned Kazakh company KazAtomProm signed a memorandum of understanding for supply of uranium for Indias nuclear power plants.        
	In between, Mukherjee called national security adviser M.K. Narayanan and principal secretary to the Prime Minister T.K.A. Nair for a meeting in his office before leaving for the Congress headquarters.        
	Mukherjee chaired a meeting of the manifesto committee, which firmed up a draft. He said he would hand over the document to Sonia Gandhi, who will place it before the Congress Working Committee for the final endorsement.         
	Mukherjee also had a one-to-one with Sonias political secretary Ahmed Patel.        
	He was expected to wrap up his day with a banquet, hosted by the President, in Nazarbayevs honour.        
	However, Patil, and not Mukherjee, would make the customary speech in the Prime Ministers absence.

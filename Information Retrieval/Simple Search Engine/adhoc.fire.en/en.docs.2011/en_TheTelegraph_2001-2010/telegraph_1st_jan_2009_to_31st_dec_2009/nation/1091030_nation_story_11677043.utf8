	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 29: An 18-year-old engineering student out shopping was bundled into a car at knife-point and allegedly raped by two youths who filmed the act on their phones and laptop.        
	Marketing executive Swastik Sandeep, 29, and his friend Sanjay Suhachiya, 30, who runs a ladies hostel, have been arrested, police said.        
	The two had forced the girl, who is a second-year student of garment engineering at Dhenkanal Polytechnic, into the car outside a shopping plaza in Jaydev Vihar around six last evening.        
	They drove to Sanjays hostel in nearby BJB Nagar where they allegedly took turns to rape her while filming the entire episode, the victim said in her FIR. The duo dumped her on a busy street a few hours later. Locals and passers-by found the girl sobbing and took her to the nearby Nayapalli police station, the FIR said.        
	The cops immediately rushed to Sanjays hostel with the victim and arrested him late at night. Swastik was picked up a little later from Cuttack, around 30km away.         
	This morning, the case was transferred to an all-woman police station, where the two accused are being interrogated.        
	The alleged crime in Sanjays hostel and its filming sparked allegations that the case was part of a larger blue film racket, but the police denied the charges.         
	The victim had come home to Bhubaneswar from Dhenkanal, around 100km away, a few days back.

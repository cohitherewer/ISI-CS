	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 9: In Orissa, over 1.2 lakh small and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs) employ more than 6 lakh people, revealed chief minister Naveen Patnaik at a state function celebrating the foundation day of Utkal Chamber of Commerce and Industry (UCCI) today.         
	Our government has made available credit to the tune of Rs 560 crore to the SME sector during the first quarter of the current fiscal, said Naveen speaking at the ceremony.        
	However, while admitting that there was some sort of help trickling their way UCCI president Niaranjan Mohanty pointed out that the SMEs had a long way to go, as it was troubled by inadequate funds and lack of support from mega and large industries and government departments.        
	However, on a positive note he added that proper identification of an entrepreneur, availability of finance on time, quality material and power, besides a strategic market support, could build better prospects for the sector, he added.         
	A vision document-2030, prepared by the chamber and focusing on challenges ahead, was also released on the occasion.         
	The document contained guidelines for consolidation and growth of Orissa and for making the state an industrially advanced and economically prosperous one.

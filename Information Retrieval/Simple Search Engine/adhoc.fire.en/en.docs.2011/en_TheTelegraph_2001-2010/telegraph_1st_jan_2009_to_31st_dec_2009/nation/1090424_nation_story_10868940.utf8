The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Posco pot still boiling, voters keep off booths 
                                                                                                               Posco pot still boiling, voters keep off booths 
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY IN GOVINDPUR (ORISSA)                          A transit camp housing pro-Posco families                                  
	The trickle of voters from this Orissa village meant fear had won. Fear of arrest.        
	There are warrants against all of us. If we step out, we run the risk of being arrested, Babuli Raut had said before the second and final round of polling for the Assembly and Parliament got under way in the coastal state.        
	The warrants have been out since supporters of the Posco project and those opposing the entry of the South Korean steel giant in Govindpur, Jagatsinghpur district, fought a pitched battle last year with bombs and other weapons.        
	Since October, all top leaders of the anti-project Posco Pratirodh Sangram Samiti are in jail on charges ranging from rape, kidnapping and arson to dacoity.        
	Raut is one of the second-rung leaders of the group. Their chief Abhay Sahu faces 32 charges under the penal code.        
	The day Sahu got bail, two more charges were slapped against him, said Raut, among a dozen men who were catching an afternoon nap in a low-thatched room, barely tall enough to stand straight.        
	There was a power cut in the village, one of the endless ones that plague most of rural Orissa, but a strong breeze was blowing from the Bay of Bengal, 7km away.        
	We havent been able to step out of our village for the past one year, Raut continued after a pause.        
	Police have registered a case against Sahu and others. So whenever anyone steps out, he is arrested and his name included in others.        
	Posco supporters help police in identifying us, said Ashok Bardhan, another anti-Posco leader in Govindpur, an hour-and-a-halfs drive from state capital Bhubaneswar.        
	Anyone who wants to vote can vote, but at their own risk, said Narendra Swain, a Samiti leader from Dhinkia, hardly a kilometre away. Who do you think will turn up to vote in such a situation?        
	Both Govindpur and Dhinkia fall under the Jagatsinghpur Lok Sabha constituency that went to polls on Thursday.                    
	In a nearby transit camp, a row of badly built low houses with asbestos roofs, live some 15 families.        
	They are on the other side of the divide  in other words, pro-Posco.        
	We have lost everything. Our land has been taken away. We are not allowed to enter the village, said an inmate of the camp Posco has built for these Govindpur families.        
	The company promised a lot when we came here, said another camp resident. But we have got nothing so far.        
	Their counterparts from Dhinkia are better off. Some 52 families from the village were the first to move into the camp. We get Rs 4,000 from the company daily for 212 people, said their leader Nirvaya Samantaray.        
	That works out to Rs 18 per head daily, he said. But we dont share this with the Govindpur people. We have just offered them shelter.        
	Samantaray, who heads the United Posco Action Committee, claims that many villagers secretly want the steel plant but are afraid to speak up. Hardly 50-odd families are against the project, he said.        
	Anti-Posco leaders Raut and Bardhan bristle at the suggestion. All of us are together in opposing the project, they said. We will oppose it till the end.        
	Another villager said hardly any of them had studied beyond Class VIII. What job will the company give us? Money? What money is the company showing us? It has offered us Rs 10 lakh. I earn Rs 40,000 for betel leaves in a season, and Rs 30,000 for cashew.        
	The land here is fertile. Throw a seed and it will grow, said one villager. If we want fish, we just put nets in the river or the sea. If we want wood, we go to the forest. Wood sells at Rs 1,000 a quintal.        
	Prawns abound in the nearby saline ponds.         
	Posco not only wants to take over some 400 acres of village land for its proposed steel plant but also 3,600 acres in the nearby forests.         
	To stop police from forcibly evicting them, the villagers have put up barricades along the single road that cuts through Govindpur.        
	Its as if the village has walled itself in. In Dhinkia, villagers have cut themselves off from the world outside. They have shut the only post office within miles.        
	The police and administration have stayed away after initially trying strong-arm tactics. The focus is now on wearing the villagers down.        
	As a first step, citing law-and-order problems, the administration shifted the polling booths from Govindpur and Dhinkia to Nuagoan and Trilochanpur, about 8-9km away.        
	The villagers were furious. We are self-respecting people. We shall not vote, one Govindpur resident had said. Elections can be held in Kashmir. Why not here? We are being victimised by the administration for opposing Posco.        
	The administration cannot ride roughshod over us, said Swain, the Samiti leader in Dhinkia. It should have consulted us before shifting the polling stations.        
	Net result: few turned up to vote.

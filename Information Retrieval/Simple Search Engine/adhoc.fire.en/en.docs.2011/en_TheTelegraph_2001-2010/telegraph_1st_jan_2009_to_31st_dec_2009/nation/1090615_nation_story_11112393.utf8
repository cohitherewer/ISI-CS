                                                                                                               Migrants on bus to Bengal
          OUR CORRESPONDENT      
	Imphal, June 14: Migrant workers from Bengal staying in relief camps after four were killed last week have started returning home despite the Manipur governments assurances of protection.        
	This morning, at least 20 from one of the two camps, one set up in a school, boarded buses for Bengal. Others stayed back for want of money.        
	The camps are home to nearly 250 migrants, including 130 from Bengal. Police have brought them from Imphal and its nearby areas and kept them in the shelters for safety.        
	Six migrants from Bengal, engaged as construction workers, were called out of their huts on the Central Agricultural University campus on Thursday night, made to sit in a row on a football field and fired at. Four died and two escaped. The bodies were flown to Calcutta yesterday.        
	Bengal armed police commandant S. Sherpa visited one camp yesterday.        
	We briefed him about the situation. He told us the Manipur government would provide us security and asked us to stay in the camp till things improve. He also promised help from the Bengal government, said Sanjay Naiya, who is from South 24-Parganas.        
	Sherpa met Manipur inspector-general V. Zathang, the acting state police chief.         
	I told him we are trying to arrest the culprits and put tighter security measures in place. He assured me that no harm would come to Manipuris living in Bengal, Zathang said.        
	But those in the camps seemed desperate to leave. We want to go home. But we do not have money. Our contractor, Binod Mandal, is away in Calcutta. We dont know what to do, said Sanjay.         
	One of the four victims was a brother of the contractor. The migrants are likely to ask the Bengal government to fund their trip home.        
	Authorities claimed those at the camps were well looked after. The administration has been providing the migrants Rs 60 daily for food.         
	The managements of the Bheirodan High School and a dharamshala, where the other camp has been set up, are also helping with food. There is no problem about safety, food and lodging. We are making all possible arrangements to help the migrants, an official at the dharamshala camp said.        
	There have been no further attacks on migrants, but the police have not been able to name the culprits involved in last weeks shooting.        
	The All-Manipur Construction Workers Union has demanded an inquiry into migrant killings and compensation for the families of victims. Twenty-two migrants have been killed since February this year.

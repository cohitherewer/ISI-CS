  India, Pak in away match          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                                     
	Sharm-al-Sheikh, July 15: This is a bit like having to play cricket in Canada because you cant do it at home  Indian and Pakistani leaders have leapfrogged from third country to third country desperately seeking an entente that now appears a mere handshake away.        
	A good and detailed 90-minute meeting between foreign secretaries Shiv Shankar Menon and Salman Bashir late last night by the manicured Red Sea shores, several shorter conversations pinched between hectic inaugural-day summiteering on the ringside of NAM today, and it appears almost certain that with a little long-distance prodding from the US, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and counterpart Yousaf Raza Gilani will be goaded onto a common media stage tomorrow.         
	Following our long meeting last night, we continued talking today, foreign secretary Menon told journalists late tonight. But youll know the final outcome only tomorrow, weve both decided we are not going to negotiate through the media.        
	Menon also had a 20-minute unscheduled conversation with the Pakistani Prime Minister on the sidelines but doggedly refused to reveal any details or even how he thought the talks were progressing.        
	We have never stopped talking to Pakistan, Menon said. What we are doing now is to see how we can take our dialogue forward from this stressed situation. There was nothing in Menons remarks, or body language, tonight to suggest any sudden souring at Sharm-al-Sheikh, although it must be said there is nothing to indicate a lightning breakthrough either.        
	Sources suggest it is likely that Menon and Bashir will meet again later tonight or tomorrow morning ahead of talks between Manmohan Singh and Yousuf Raza Gilani, and this continuing conversation alone indicates that there has been behind-the-scenes progress in dialogue, something that could very well translate into a joint statement or press meet tomorrow.        
	Its still not clear how far this zig-zag scramble for a fresh grip on bilateral ties will get at this summit, but the current status of relations can securely be described as in a state of threeze  the freeze began to give with the Manmohan-Zardari handshake at Yekaterinburg but it is unlikely to evolve into a full-blown thaw at Sharm-al-Sheikh.        
	Plainly put, there will be a resolve to talk on but no immediate resort to composite dialogue. The Pakistanis have been pushing hard for it  on the global PR stage and in the bilateral backrooms  but the Indians are reserving decision, still not quite convinced about Islamabads honesty of intent on punishing the Mumbai plotters and neutralising the terror infrastructure operating from Pakistani side.        
	No details have emerged about what the foreign secretaries spoke about but the central agenda cant be a matter of too much speculation  action against the guilty of Mumbai and the steps Islamabad is taking to tackle the Pakistan-based terror network.        
	Differences of perception clearly persist between the two sides on what exactly constitutes meaningful movement in ties  the Pakistanis will view anything less than resumption of composite dialogue with pessimism and use labels like deadlock, the Indian side, on the other hand, will even consider a convivial Manmohan-Gilani handshake progress in the circumstances.         
	Background briefing the two subcontinental media contingents have received from respective officials reflect those differences  the grammar on the Indian side is suffused with positives, the Pakistanis are using muted, often pessimistic, adjectives. But as one senior member of the Indian delegation put it: The world can see we are willing to talk and actually talking even in the absence of any demonstrable Pakistani action against the terror network.        
	Referring to ISI chief Lt Gen Ahmed Shuja Pashas recent briefings to Indian military attaches in Islamabad, he said, There is some movement on the Mumbai terror attack which we consider to be broadly satisfactory, but we must wait to see more concrete action being taken.        
	Asked about the dossier passed on to India over the weekend, foreign secretary Menon confirmed it named five people currently under detention for plotting the Mumbai attack, and nine other proclaimed offenders. Answering a specific question, he said that although India had consistently raised the issue of Dawood Ibrahims extradition, the Mumbai dons name did not figure on the dossier.        
	The fate of Hafiz Sayeed of the JuD  it is still unclear whether the Pakistani establishment will produce a strong case against him, or let him get off on legal technicalities --- has become a test case of sorts of Pakistani intentions. Any let off would be received badly by New Delhi, which has called Sayeed a big part of the terror infrastructure who should be punished under the laws of any decent and civilised society.        
	Sayeed trial did come up in the Menon-Bashir conversations here but neither side is offering any details. But there are also signals emanating from South Block that one person should not be allowed to haunt and jeopardise the entire dialogue process.        
	Speaking to a television channel here, external affairs minister S.M. Krishna himself said that in the context of Sayeed India should take an understanding view of the fact that Pakistan has its own legal processes. This could be indication that notwithstanding the many, and influential, hawks in it foreign policy/security establishment, New Delhi is prepared to be more patient and not squander the momentum of Yekaterinburg and Sharm-al-Sheikh.        
	Having fairly convinced itself that not talking to Pakistan was not getting India anywhere and having announced elder-brotherly intent of going more than half the way, the dominant sense appears to be to forge on with talks without letting up pressure on Pakistan to act against the terror network. New Delhi is probably also drawing some diplomatic comfort from the not-so-subtle symbolism US secretary of state Hillary Clinton has decided to strike on her impending India visit.        
	The meaning of her choice of Mumbai as first port of call and the Taj as camp address cant be lost on too many. Foreign office spin doctors are also not omitting to underline that Clinton does not have Pakistan on her current travel plans.        
	She is, in the words of one official, at once de-hyphenating India and Pakistan and by choosing to go to Mumbai and stay at the Taj, she is also communicating to Pakistan that 26/11 is a milestone you cannot ignore in the fight against terror.

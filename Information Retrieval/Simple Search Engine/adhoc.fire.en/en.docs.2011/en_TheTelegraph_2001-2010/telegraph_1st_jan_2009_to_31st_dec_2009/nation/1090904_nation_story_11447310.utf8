          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Sept. 3: A Bihar court has asked chief minister Nitish Kumar to appear before it on September 9 in connection with his alleged involvement in the murder of a Congress activist in November 1991.        
	The summons has prompted rival Lalu Prasad to demand his resignation. Nitish has been summonsed in a murder case and should resign, Lalu said, adding that the chief minister had concealed the matter while submitting his affidavit before the polls.        
	Additional chief judicial magistrate Ranjan Kumar issued the order on September 1, asking Nitish and LJP MLA Dularchand Yadav to appear before the court for hearing of a petition filed by one Ashok Singh, a relative of the deceased Sitaram Singh who was killed in a firing at a polling station of Barh Lok Sabha seat on November 16, 1991.         
	Nitish contested and won the poll as a Janata Dal nominee. Nitish, Lalu and Dularchand were in the same party then. Sitarams relatives had named Nitish, but the prosecution had given a clean chit after no evidence was found.         
	Singh later challenged the verdict.

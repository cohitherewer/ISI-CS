The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Diamond to drug trial, to beat job blues
                                                                                                               Diamond to drug trial, to beat job blues
  - Desperate Gujarat workers throng research labs to offer bodies for tests										      BASANT RAWAT                                    
	Ahmedabad, Feb. 11: Jobless workers from Gujarats famed but troubled diamond industry are flocking to research laboratories to become guinea pigs for clinical trials.        
	Unmindful of the risks to their health, these desperate workers are offering their bodies for trials because they see it as the only way to survive. Gujarat has around a dozen clinical laboratories across Ahmedabad, Vadodara and Surat which are contracted by pharmaceutical companies to carry out tests for new drugs.         
	Sources in the Surat diamond industry and the clinical labs said at least 4,000 workers who had lost their jobs had offered to be tested upon. The selection depends on their physical condition. Each trial fetches them anything between Rs 5,000 and Rs 15,000, depending on the number of days required for the trial.         
	During the trial, the drug is administered to them after which blood samples are collected and monitored.         
	Ajay (name chaged), who lost his job in Surat in November, has been tested upon four times in the last two months. The 25-year-old youth went to a clinical unit in Vadodara, where he kept mum about the first trial conducted on him less than a fortnight ago in Ahmedabad.         
	The hunt for the human guinea pigs is handled by a well-oiled network of agents. We have our own skilled staff to co-ordinate with needy people, including diamond workers in the city and rural areas, said a senior executive at Accutest Research Laboratories, a clinical trial unit in Ahmedabad.        
	Lambda, Asias largest clinical research unit on the Sankhej-Gandhinagar highway, has lodging facilities inside its sprawling complex off Ahmedabad. It was here that Ajay and Mahesh, 28, stayed for several days during the study as the trials are dubbed.        
	Mahesh said the first time, he went along with an agent, but the second time, I went on my own.        
	Ever since the diamond unit where I worked closed down, even local grocers have refused to give me goods on credit. There was no other work available and I have to look after my family. So when someone introduced me to a clinical research agent, I agreed to go for the trial. When he took me to the lab, I found to my surprise that several diamond workers from Bapunagar were also there, said Mahesh. He was paid Rs 5,000 and Rs 10,000 for two stints.         
	But Bharat Patel, 40, was not so lucky.        
	Patel, who weighed less than 50kg, was not found fit for trial though his agent tried to push his case. Unemployed for four months, Patel has not given up and has been doing the rounds of the lab for another chance to offer his malnourished body for trial.         
	Nirav Parikh, the spokesperson for Lambda, neither confirmed nor denied that clinical trials were being conducted on jobless diamond workers. I cannot talk to you on the clinical trials, Parikh said.        
	However, a security guard outside the complex said that not just diamond workers from the state, even poor and unemployed people from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar turned up in droves.         
	Sources involved in the study said the agents would have to keep track of the trial volunteer and observe him for three years, until the drug was manufactured and patented, or dumped. In some cases the effects of the drugs show up after three years, said a source.        
	Medical sources said carrying out the trial was not against the law, but there were ethical issues since most of those volunteering for the tests were poor people who had little idea of the side effects and were desperate for the money.         
	Pravin Kanabar, a leading doctor and social activist, said while the risk to life in such trials was negligible, the possibility of side effects was high, many of which could persist through life.        
	Gujarat health minister and government spokesperson Jaynarayan Vyas refused to comment. We dont monitor the clinical trials, he said.

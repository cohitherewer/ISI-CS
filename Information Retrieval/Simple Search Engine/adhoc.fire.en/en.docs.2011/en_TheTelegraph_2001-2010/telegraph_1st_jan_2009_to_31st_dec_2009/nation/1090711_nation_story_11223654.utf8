                                                                                                               Yechury jab at food law math
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Yechury                          
	New Delhi, July 10: Confronted with iron-cast arithmetic, agriculture minister Sharad Pawar had to agree today that the governments proposed food security act would force the countrys poorest to pay more for food.        
	Shouldnt the government call it the food insecurity act then, CPM member Sitaram Yechury rubbed it in after punching holes in the UPAs vaunted pro-poor scheme in the Rajya Sabha.        
	The Congress poll manifesto had promised 25kg rice or wheat per month at Rs 3 a kg to every below-poverty-line family, and President Pratibha Patils address to Parliament had said a law would be passed to make this a reality.        
	Yechury, however, said that the Antyodaya scheme, meant for the poorest, now provided families with 35kg of rice at Rs 2 a kg. Besides, many states were further subsidising this and providing 20kg of food grain at Re 1 a kg.        
	The Antyodaya, a central government scheme, is giving 35kg at two rupees, and now you propose to bring a food security act where you will reduce it to 25kg and increase the price by one rupee. Would the honourable minister consider terming this new act the food insecurity act and not the food security act in the light of this? Yechury said.        
	Pawar said that what Yechury had argued had been pointed out by others too. He hinted at possible modifications to the proposed food act, saying the Centre was examining its various aspects in consultation with the stakeholders.        
	He conceded that to fulfil the commitment made by the President in its current form, the Antyodaya scheme would have to be scrapped, which I think is not proper.        
	The act is meant to provide a statutory basis for a framework to provide food to all.        
	The Rajya Sabha members also cited gaping lacunae in the countrys public distribution system (PDS).         
	Pawar put the ball in the states court saying that ultimately, its the state governments that needed to plug the holes. He, however, made some revelations about the states handling of the PDS.        
	The Planning Commission has stated that there are 6.52 crore BPL families in the country, Pawar said, while the state governments have actually issued more than 10 crore ration cards.

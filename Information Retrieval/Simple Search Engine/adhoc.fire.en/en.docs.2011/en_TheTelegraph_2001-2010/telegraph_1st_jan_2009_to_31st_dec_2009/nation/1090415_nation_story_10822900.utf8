          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, April 14: If the boot was on their mind, Jagdish Tytler and Sajjan Kumar didnt shoe it.        
	The two yesterday met Sonia Gandhi, but there was no reference to the circumstances  a journalists shoe missile at P. Chidambaram and Sikh anger  that led to their exit from the election fray from the Northeast and South Delhi seats.        
	Sources said they had called on the Congress chief to pledge support to the candidates replacing them. Tytler reportedly endorsed the candidature of Delhi Congress chief J.P. Aggarwal as his replacement from the Northeast seat.        
	Aggarwal, a Rajya Sabha MP, refused to deny or confirm his nomination. I will abide by Soniajis directive, he told cheering supporters.        
	Delhi goes to polls on May 7 and April 17 is the last date for filing nominations.        
	Sajjan told Sonia that, as a disciplined soldier of the party, he would support anyone she nominates. But the influential Jat leader, who had stormed off to Mussouri after being eased out, is reportedly pushing for his brother or son Jagparvesh as his replacement.

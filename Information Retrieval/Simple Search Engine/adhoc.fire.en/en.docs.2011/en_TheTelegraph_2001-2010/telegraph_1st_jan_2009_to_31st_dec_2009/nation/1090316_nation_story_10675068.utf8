The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Independent hint of Kerala thaw
                                                                                                               Independent hint of Kerala thaw
          JOHN MARY                               
	Thiruvananthapuram, March 15: The hint of a rapprochement between the CPM and the CPI over Keralas Ponnani seat emerged today with the Independent candidate suspending his campaign.         
	Hussein Randathani said he would remain in the fray only if the CPI endorsed his candidature.         
	The change of stand by Randathani, who enjoys the tacit support of the CPM, came even as general secretaries of the two parties tried in Delhi to hammer a way out of the muddle.         
	Randathani, a Muslim scholar, said: Ponnani is the Lok Sabha seat of the CPI. Ill not contest there without the support of the CPI. The unity of the Left is more important than my candidature.         
	Told that he had earlier said he would remain a peoples candidate regardless of the CPIs position, Randathani said his decision was prompted by CPM state secretary Pinarayi Vijayans clarification that the CPI has four seats, including Ponnani.         
	Following this clarification, its not fair for me to impose myself. Its left to the CPI to decide the candidate.         
	Observers suggested that the CPM might have directed Randathani to suspend the campaign. Otherwise, he could have done it soon after Vijayans clarification on Friday.         
	Over the last two days, Randathani had been touring the constituency and telling TV channels that there was no question of his withdrawal.         
	His announcement today coincided with moves in New Delhi. CPM politburo member S. Ramachandran Pillai told a TV channel the party had not taken a decision on Ponnani, implying Randathani might have to withdraw.         
	The CPI nominee for Ponnani is a Canara Bank official, A.P. Kunhamu. He has not started campaigning yet as he was waiting for the parties to find a way out.

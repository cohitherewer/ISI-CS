The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | A citys burden of grief   If I buy a candle and vanish to the Gateway, what will I eat?
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      A citys burden of grief     If I buy a candle and vanish to the Gateway, what will I eat?
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                                                  
	Mumbai, Nov 26: What they call the indomitable spirit of Mumbai is actually a beast of many burdens that must lumber on to merely survive, come terror, come torrent.         
	It has neither the time nor the means to light candles. It does not join marches in protest or for peace. It doesnt go to anniversary prayers. It doesnt hold banners or hold hands in deference to the many-fangled fetes of live television. It just holds Mumbai together.         
	Its given destiny is to rise day after day from the citys vast and wallowing underbelly to drive the island India calls the jewel in its crown, everything from its trains and buses and cars to the lifts up and down its dazzling crop of high-rises, everything from communication circuits to key levers in the powerhouses of electricity and of commerce and cash.         
	Its given destiny is to labour so Mumbai can remain lavish.         
	So as remembrance descended on Mumbai today in many manicured tableaux of enshrined grief and publicised pledge  dainty candle-lit temples in the restored show-window glitter of five-star facilities and trickles of peace marches carefully embossed with signature boards of their sponsors, political and anti-political  the spirit of the city remained yoked to task, far from Mumbais fabled landmarks, far beyond the formidable gaze of television.         
	In the steamy labyrinth of Byculla and Tulsivadi, in the busy godowns of Dockyard and Cotton Green, in the roughneck lanes of Mahim, in the service slums strewn from Khar and Bandra to Colaba and Cuffe parade, which provide Mumbais classes its workers.         
	Remember what, and mourn for who? countered a small printing works owner in Byculla, almost as a sardonic retort to the televised emotion relentlessly spewing from the little set lumped on a stack of papers. It isnt as if people didnt die in terror attacks or riots in Mumbai before this. Why forget 1992 and 1993, why forget the poor passengers who lost lives in the train blasts? If we start mourning like this, wholl run this city? And forget the city, if I buy a candle and vanish to the Gateway, what will I eat when I return? This is not some birthday we need to fuss over, do your job, get on.        
	Listening in was Raju barber from the neighbouring Chakachak Sailun, as shambled a shop as it was full. He butted in, utterly Bollywood slapstick. Dadhi kaun kaatega, babuon ka baal kaun banayega, aur hum roti kaise khaayega itna royega aur mombatti jalayega to? (Who will do the shaving, who will cut the gentlemens hair, and how will I eat if I cry so much and burn up so many candles?)        
	But Raju barber could turn equally cynical-sardonic. Sponsored maal hai sab, he said motioning to the television, dekho rone-dhone ke beech mein kitna break lega, kitna ad dikhayega, unka kamai hai, karne do, hamara humko karne do. (Its all a sponsored affair, watch how many breaks they take between showing grief, how many ads they show. Its their way of earning money, leave me to mine.)

	But the underbelly isnt the only place carping over the elaborate anniversary rituals that the extended ground zero of South Mumbai (read Richie Rich Mumbai) has treated itself to.         
	In the offices of one of the citys elders  he would not be named, probably because he doesnt want to enter what he knows is a bitter debate  the tenor and scale of revisiting 26/11 turns into an unsettling contemplation of Mumbais layered dissonances and contradictions.         
	For a start, he says, the candle-brigade leaves me aghast. Last year, they wanted the politicians out. So what did they want, a corporate technocracy to rule Mumbai? Forget that. What did they do about what they screamed they wanted? When elections came, less than 40 per cent turned out to vote, thats the stake they display, for most of them polling day was holiday. They can afford to fly off in a crisis, the average Mumbaikars cant, they must stay here, hail or high water. Yet, those who wont even vote make the most noise, and they get heard.        
	More than a hundred do-gooder groups had sprung up in Mumbai following 26/11; there were so many, they formed an association of do-gooder groups. They resolved to take the citys destiny in their own hands, lobby for correction, force accountability, teach the lackadaisical and self-serving political class a lesson. They returned to feed the appetite of OB vans on Marine Drive today after a year-long furlough, candles in hand.        
	In this summers Lok Sabha election, a multi-national banker made a high-profile bid on an apolitical, anti-politician ticket, thinking she would ride popular sentiment straight into public office. She got a few thousand votes, no more, and promptly returned to her banking chambers.         
	Our politicians leave much to be desired, the senior Mumbaikar said, but they have one great virtue  they work with people 24/7 and they are willing to be voted out by them. That is something the Indian who goes to vote deeply respects. Look at R.R. Patil. This time last year, he took the humiliation of being sacked for 26/11, he took all manner of abuse. Now he is back as home minister, and hes leading the prayer marches, nobodys complaining.        
	Not that Patil or his fraternity have gone too far to furnish the promises they made last year  the dead and the martyred remain uncompensated, save for fulsome lip-service, the living remain unsecured.         
	But then, today was a handy occasion, they made those pledges again from fancy platforms. Not that Mumbai even bothered to listen. It was busy bearing the nightmarish burdens that make Mumbai the city of dreams.

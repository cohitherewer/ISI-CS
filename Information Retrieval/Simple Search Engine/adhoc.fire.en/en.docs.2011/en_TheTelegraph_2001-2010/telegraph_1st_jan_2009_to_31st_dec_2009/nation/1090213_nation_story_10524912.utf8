                                                                                                               Surgeons call off strike for pay hike
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Feb. 12: The All Orissa House Surgeons Association has called off their indefinite strike that began four days ago.        
	The strike has been called off following assurance from the government that the monthly stipend of house surgeons will be increased from Rs 5,000 to Rs 8,640, association president Biswanath Mohapatra said.         
	The assurance was communicated through the director of medical education and training P.K. Das. We were assured that a resolution on it would be issued by the government within a week, an association member said.         
	All the 353 house surgeons at the three state-run medical college hospitals in Cuttack, Berhampur and Burla will resume duty by this evening, he added.         
	While the government and house surgeons were fighting it out, services in the three medical college hospitals  where nearly 4,000 patients undergo treatment in the indoor wards at any given point time  were affected for the fifth consecutive day today.         
	House surgeons are a vital section of the medical services in the three medical college hospitals as they attend to and monitor treatment of patients round-the-clock.        
	Earlier Mohapatra had said that they were willing to restrict their demand for 70 per cent of an assistant surgeons pay.        
	A delegation had met the state finance minister Prafulla Chandra Ghadei on Wednesday.         
	The finance minister gave us an assurance that our demand would be considered and a government resolution on our hike issued, the association president said.        
	The Orissa government currently pays house surgeons a monthly stipend of Rs 5,000. Those at All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) are paid Rs 8,900 and those working in Bengal earn Rs 8,650.        
	We are prepared to accept a stipend in the range of what our counterparts in AIIMS and Bengal are paid, the association president had said.         
	The house surgeons of SCB Medical College in Cuttack, VSS Medical College in Burla and MKCG Medical College in Berhampur had gone on strike on Sunday, demanding a monthly stipend equivalent to 70 per cent of an assistant surgeons pay.         
	The demand came after the Sixth Pay Commissions recommendations were implemented for doctors and other employees in the health services by the state government on the basis of the Fitment Committee report.

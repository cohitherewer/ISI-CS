	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 26: The state-level single-window clearance committee, headed by the chief secretary, today cleared proposals to set up industrial projects drawing a total investment of Rs 2,037 crore.        
	With the decision, decks have been cleared for signing MoUs by promoters concerned with the state government, sources said.

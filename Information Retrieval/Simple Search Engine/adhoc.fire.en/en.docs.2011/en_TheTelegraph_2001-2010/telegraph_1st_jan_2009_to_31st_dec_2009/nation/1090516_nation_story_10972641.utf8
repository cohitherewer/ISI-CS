The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Karat works phone
                                                                                                               Karat works phone
          OUR BUREAU                          Karat: Line busy                                  
	May 15: Mayavati seems firmly in the third front, as of now, but Jayalalithaa may be wavering. The Janata Dal (Secular) too appears unsure.        
	Still, the hopes of a non-Congress secular government were alive today in the third alternative camp, which is counting on UPA partners switching over in a big way if the Congress cant get the numbers.        
	Prakash Karat had a long discussion with Bahujan Samaj Party leader Satish Chandra Mishra in the evening. Sources said Mishra assured the CPM general secretary the BSP would be present at the third fronts May 18 meeting in Delhi.        
	Karat also spoke to Biju Janata Dal leader Naveen Patnaik and the Telugu Desams Chandrababu Naidu. However, Left sources indicated they were still unsure about the ADMK.        
	We hope the ADMK would attend the May 18 meeting. A lot depends on the seats she (Jayalalithaa) gets. So lets see, a Left leader said.        
	JD(S) chief Deve Gowda has said he would talk to the Left parties on May 17 but would skip the meeting on May 18, his birthday, to go to Tirupati, PTI reported. It added that JD(S) spokesperson Danish Ali would attend the May 18 meeting.        
	Left sources said the only certainty was that the NDA would not be able to form the government. Beyond that, lets see how the numbers play up. We are working for a non-Congress secular government and that is our first priority, a Left leader said.        
	Rao rage        
	Telengana Rashtra Samiti chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao today claimed the third front had collapsed and said if anyone was to blame, it was Karat.        
	Even as campaigning was on, Karat announced the CPMs plans to support the Congress. Whom had he consulted? Rao said in Hyderabad. Karat has no moral right to pass the buck we are not his subordinates.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Maoists deny role in carnage
                                                                                                               Maoists deny role in carnage
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, Oct. 4: The CPI (Maoist) today denied its involvement in the massacre of 16 backward class farmers in Khagaria district even as Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar and police refused to buy the claim.        
	We have nothing to do with the killing of people at Amausi-Bahiyar on October 2, Sanes, who claimed to be the chief of CPI (Maoist)s east-central zonal committee, said. Had our cadres done it, they would have left handbills and pamphlets at the site.        
	Sanes added: The police are trying to malign us. We expelled Goran Sardar alias Bodan Sada (former Maoist area commander), who figures as the main accused in the case, long ago.        
	The police have found the claim unconvincing. Goran, who has a reward of Rs 50,000 on his head, controls a big arsenal and has many Maoist guerrillas as his followers, said additional director-general (police headquarters) Neelmani.        
	Nitish seconded him. Prima facie, the rebels appear to have carried out the massacre. The police are probing the case. I do not want to speak conclusively till the investigations are over.        
	We will not spare anyone who is involved in it. Yeh warchaswa ki ladai ka anjam hai (it is the fallout of a war to establish supremacy), added Nitish before leaving for Delhi.        
	Nitish today also suspended Khagaria superintendent of police Indranath Mishra and sub-divisional police officer Ajay Pandey for their inaction during the carnage.         
	The police believe that many among the 37 accused, including .P. Mahato alias Upendra Mahato, are linked to the guerrillas cause. The Maoist leadership, operating in the riverine region to spread its reach and acceptability, is trying to misguide the police and turn them away from the issue of land war, Neelmani said.        
	The investigating officers, however, said the top Maoist leadership might not have approved of the carnage.         
	Maoists had blown up a brick kiln and a guesthouse, owned by Ram Vilas Paswans brother and then MP Ramchander Paswan, at Chater in same Alauli sub-division in 2006.        
	Mahato, the mastermind behind the assault has apparently confessed in police custody that the plan was hatched at a meeting at the Amausi village headmans house about two months ago.

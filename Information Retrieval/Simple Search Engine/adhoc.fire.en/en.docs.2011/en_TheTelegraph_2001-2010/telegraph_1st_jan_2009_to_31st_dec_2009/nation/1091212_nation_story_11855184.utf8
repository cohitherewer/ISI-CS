          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 11: The Centre today said it had in principle accepted a number of controversial proposed reforms at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), triggering protests from Opposition MPs amid allegations that the changes were aimed at privatising the institute.         
	The majority of reforms proposed by a panel, appointed by the Prime Minister and headed by cardiac surgeon Marthanda Valiathan, have been accepted in principle, health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad told the Lok Sabha.         
	Azads statement, in response to a question from Janata Dal (United) MP Mangani Lal Mandal, triggered a wave of protests from Opposition MPs.         
	The Valiathan committee  set up during anti-reservation protests that rocked AIIMS in 2006 and 2007  has recommended a number of reforms the faculty have criticised as steps towards privatisation.         
	The AIIMS research council should include two representatives from the pharmaceutical industry, the Valiathan committee has recommended.         
	The institute body, the highest decision-making body of AIIMS headed by the health minister, should be expanded to include an industry representative picked in consultation with agencies like the CII, the panel has suggested.         
	These proposals, which aim to increase compatibility between industry needs and AIIMSs research output, could reduce the independence of the institute from private pharmaceutical interests, the faculty have argued.         
	A proposed affiliate self-financing non-profit institution called AIIMS International, to draw on the intellectual manpower of AIIMS for global brand-building, will distract from the institutes principal goal of serving the poor, they said.         
	The committee has also proposed allowing the faculty to offer private consultancy, like the IITs and the IIMs, and has suggested allowing doctors a two-year sabbatical to work in the private sector.         
	Leader of the Opposition, L.K. Advani, Dal (United) chief Sharad Yadav and CPM leader Basudeb Acharya were among the leaders who joined the Opposition chorus against the proposed reforms.         
	Advani demanded a detailed debate on the state of AIIMS and the proposed reforms. Addressing Azad, Speaker Meira Kumar said that given the concern, a detailed debate may be advisable.

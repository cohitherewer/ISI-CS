	New Delhi, Aug. 8: If Nitish Kumar cant stop smiling today, nobody can blame him. He just got a certificate from Amartya Sen.        
	Speaking at a seminar in Delhi, the Nobel Prize-winning economist said that during a visit to Nalanda, Rajgir, Bodh Gaya and Patna, he felt the situation had changed for the better in Bihar.         
	There are administrative changes. With initiative and leadership, it (the situation) can change, Sen, who also heads a committee to revive Nalanda university into the proposed Nalanda International University near Rajgir, said without going into specifics.        
	The certificate came six months after Sen had pointed to the decline in law and order and the failure to build infrastructure as the reasons behind Bihars plight during a February lecture trip to Patna.        
	He also had a brief meeting with the chief minister on the sidelines of the lecture.        
	Asked about Sens observation today, Janata Dal (United) MP Shivanand Tiwari said from Patna: After winning the (state) elections, we have been focusing on law and order and infrastructure.        
	At the seminar, Sen spoke on food security, and how malnutrition in women and children, healthcare and education were all linked. He said no single government programme could be expected to solve problems and, instead, suggested a multiplicity of vehicles.        
	Sen said there were deficiencies in the BPL card system but added that there had to be concrete arguments on why dispensing cash vouchers to the poor was a better alternative than distributing food grain.        
	Nitish has twice written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, saying that instead of food grain, he would prefer a mechanism through which beneficiaries would get cash to prevent corruption in the public distribution system (PDS).        
	Answering a question on whether a universal instead of a targeted system of PDS would be better, Sen said it was not a question of which one was better but how the system was designed.        
	At present, the Centre provides food grain at cheaper rates through ration shops only to select segments of the population, such as the poorest of the poor, the poor and people above the poverty line.        
	Sen lauded the UPA governments schemes and pointed out scope for improvement in almost all of them.        
	Unwilling to comment on the right to food act passed this week in Parliament, the economist said he needed to see it before he could admire it.        
	But he did point out that if right to food is achieved, there could be an argument that the national rural employment guarantee scheme will not be needed.

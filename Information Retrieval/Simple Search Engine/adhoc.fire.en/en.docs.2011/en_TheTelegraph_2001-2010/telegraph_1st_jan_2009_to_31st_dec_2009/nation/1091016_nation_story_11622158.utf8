          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 15: The CPM has alleged that an understanding exists between Maoists and the Trinamul Congress and flayed the so-called intellectuals mobilised by Mamata Banerjees party.        
	The editorial in the forthcoming issue of CPM mouthpiece Peoples Democracy says Chhatradhar Mahato, the arrested leader of the Peoples Committee against Police Atrocities, has revealed that the Maoists received complete support and protection from the Trinamul Congress.        
	Mahato has also told police that the committee was a front created by the Maoists to be used to cordon off an area and make it out of bounds for the police and civil administration, it says.        
	Local Trinamul leaders would provide both shelter and assistance for the Maoists. Clearly, the Trinamul Congress both patronised and provided political cover for the Maoists.        
	The editorial also says that Mahato has revealed that the so-called intellectuals mobilised by the Trinamul Congress provided huge amounts of monetary donations.

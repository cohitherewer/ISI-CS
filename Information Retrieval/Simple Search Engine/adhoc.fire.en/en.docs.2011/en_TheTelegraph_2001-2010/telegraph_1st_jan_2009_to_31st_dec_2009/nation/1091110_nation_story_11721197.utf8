The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Spy cash trail leads to Europe

          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 9: Government officials claim Pakistan is funding its spies in India through money transfers from Europe to small towns of northern India, underlining the need for tighter cyber laws.        
	Over the past year and a half, small sums were regularly sent from at least one south European nation through a popular money transfer company, the sources told The Telegraph.        
	They alleged that a journalist arrested recently in Kashmir had passed sensitive information to his ISI handlers during visits to Islamabad and Muzaffarabad, and in return received money from Europe.        
	According to the sources, the money transfer works in two steps.        
	First, an email account is opened and the password shared by the spy in India and the handler in Pakistan.        
	Second, a contact in Europe sends funds through the money transfer company, and the unique 10-digit ID is saved as a draft in the users mailbox. The spy opens the mailbox from his end, reads the ID and collects the money.        
	Last month, the European Commission had decided to refer Spain to the European Court of Justice over its failure to enact effective penalties in response to the European Union regulations on payer information accompanying money transfer. The regulations were adopted in 2006 to monitor money transfers and cut off funding for terrorists and other criminals.        
	Steps have also been taken against Estonia and Luxembourg, the sources said.        
	India too firmed up such provisions recently. Cyber law expert Pavan Duggal, however, said activities like mailbox-sharing were not covered by the latest amendments to the information technology law.        
	The sources said mailbox-sharing also allowed the spies to send to Pakistan photographs and details of military installations in northern India.        
	Earlier this year, Punjab police arrested a Pakistani, Javed Iqbal, said to be masquerading as Ramesh Chauhan in Pathankot. He was allegedly exchanging information with his Pakistani handlers through a common mailbox.        
	 Iqbal too received money routed through a third country using this simple technique, a source said.        
	The officials claimed that like Iqbal, the Kashmiri journalist too had been recruited as a spy in Pakistan during a visit to Islamabad in 2006. The journalist allegedly met Shahaji alias Umer, a senior ISI officer, and top Lashkar-e-Toiba and Hizbul Mujahideen commanders.        
	A nine-member task force set up this year by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) will deal with money-laundering in the second volume of its report on National security and terrorism. The first volume was handed over to Union home minister P. Chidambaram today.        
	The panel is headed by the industrialist and Independent Rajya Sabha member from Karnataka, Rajeev Chandrasekhar.

  - Training to change bookish ways of teaching        CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                     
	New Delhi, June 28: Longer hours of learning, rigorous internships, lessons from Gandhi and Tagore and a sabbatical from work for research could form the template for an ambitious new curriculum under development for Indias schoolteachers.         
	The planned National Curriculum Framework for Teacher Education, announced on Thursday by education minister Kapil Sibal, aims to arm teachers with techniques that will allow them to act as mentors to students.         
	Draft plans available with The Telegraph reveal that the framework will aim at preparing teachers to be life skill facilitators, as much at ease handling a students emotional distress as a sum in math.         
	The framework is being prepared jointly by the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) and the National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT)  apex bodies for teacher training and school curricula, respectively.         
	The idea is to equip aspiring teachers with skills that will enable them to teach students holistically. Naturally, the teacher must know her subject, but her responsibility will be to teach students about life, a senior NCERT official involved in the project said.         
	Teacher education in India has two components  training before joining the profession and skills gained through mid-career programmes.         
	The first component  pre-service education  consists of a diploma in education (DEd) required for primary school teaching and a bachelor in education (BEd) needed for teaching upper primary and secondary school classes.         
	In-service training is more informal and is administered both through classes of variable duration offered by the government and private institutions, and through workshops.         
	Together, these two components comprise one of the worlds largest teacher training programmes, according to NCTE officials.         
	But both Indias pre-service training and in-service training for teachers are outdated and create a culture where bookish knowledge is given more weight than skills at dealing with students, these officials say.         
	The new curriculum is likely to use a four-year undergraduate course in Delhi University  bachelor of elementary education (BElEd)  as its model for all primary school teaching, a senior NCTE official said.         
	The DEd programme is generally of two years duration and is offered through correspondence by some institutions as well.         
	The products of the four-year course are performing better than those of any other course for primary school teachers in the country. That led us to evaluate this course and it is likely to serve as a model, the official said.         
	For aspiring teachers at the upper primary and secondary school levels, the framework is likely to recommend internships in schools as a mandatory component of training.         
	A sustained contact through internship would help teachers to choose, design, organise and conduct meaningful classroom activities, critically reflect upon their own practices through observations and develop strategies for evaluating childrens learning for feedback into curriculum and pedagogic practice, the draft document says.         
	Schools would benefit from hiring interns, too, as the practice would allow them the opportunity to learn the latest teaching techniques from the aspiring teachers, the document argues.         
	Training modules will be required to teach not just standard techniques but also human rights, child psychology and works by Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore and educationist Gijubhai Badheka on teacher training.

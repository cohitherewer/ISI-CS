                                                                                                               Samaritan struggles to save job after rescue
          PRIYA ABRAHAM                           Srinivas Rao: Braveheart                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 24: In Orissa, it seems, no good deed goes unpunished.         
	A driver who risked his life and hand to save 60 bus passengers is now struggling to save his job and meet his daily expenses. The Samaritan is also suffering from severed veins and an injured right hand.         
	On February 3, Srinivas Rao, 35, was sipping tea outside a tea kiosk close to Nicco Park Square, when a speeding town bus rammed into a motorbike, coming from the opposite direction. Before the passers-by could react the bus driver got off and vanished among the crowd, leaving his bus still moving on a sloping rope. Rao, a driver with a travel agency, did not think twice before running towards the bus and jumping right in. The window to the drivers seat was shut, so I stood on the footrest, put my left hand through the window and tried to control the steering wheel, said Rao. However, the bus did not stop.         
	I knew the bus would not stop until the brakes were applied. For that I had to be in the bus. I asked one passer-by to hand me a stone so that I could break the windscreen. I managed to break the glass to make enough space to get inside, he said.        
	By the time the brave man entered the bus, he was bleeding profusely.         
	I did not know where the blood was oozing from. All I can remember is that I sat on the drivers seat and controlled the vehicle. I do not know what happened thereafter, he remembered. Rao had fallen unconscious.         
	When I regained my senses I was at the Capital Hospital where I learnt that my right had was damaged and had gone numb, Rao said.         
	Rao was then rushed to Kar Clinic where he spent three days in the ICU.         
	Three veins were severed and we had to operate on his hand. The cost for the operation was around Rs 30,000. Neither the bus owner who left the vehicle nor a passenger whose life he had saved came to see what happened to Rao, said a doctor.         
	Since, I had no money to meet the expenses, I had to borrow it from friends and family. The doctors have asked me to rest, but I cannot do that as I am the only earning member, said Rao.        
	My colleagues rebuke me stating that I should not have rescued the passengers. I do not want any gratitude and I know that god will help me out. Also, deep inside I am satisfied that I have saved lives, he said.        
	However, things are not as smooth as the man says it to be. His wife is about to deliver their child by next week and the driver has been asked to take an unpaid leave by his employers who thinks that it would be too risky to employ a driver with an injured hand.         
	I have no alternative source of money and cant take the risk of leaving my job now before my childs birth.

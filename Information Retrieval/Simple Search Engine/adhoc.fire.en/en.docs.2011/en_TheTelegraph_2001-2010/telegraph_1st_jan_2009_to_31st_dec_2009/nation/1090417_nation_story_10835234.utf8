The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Missile boot on Advani foot 
                                                                                                               Missile boot on Advani foot 
  - Friendly footwear misses target           RASHEED KIDWAI                            TV footage of the slipper thrown at Advani; (Above) Aggarwal being taken away by police                                       
	Bhopal, April 16: L.K. Advani today found himself in P. Chidambarams shoes when a disgruntled BJP worker threw a wooden slipper at him at a party rally in Madhya Pradesh.        
	The khadau, a popular footwear with Hindu priests and monks, landed short of the dais, 125 metres away, but left the BJP red-faced in its bastion and Advani looking out of sorts the rest of the meeting.        
	Attacker Pawas Aggarwal, said to be a member of the BJP trader cell in Katni district where the rally was held, cried: Nahi chahiye nakli PM, nahi chahiye nakli Loh Purush (we dont want a fake PM, we dont want a fake Iron Man).        
	While being led away by police, the man in his mid-30s began shouting again: He (Advani) has no ideology. On the one hand he asks for votes in the name of Ram and on the other hand pays obeisance to (Mohammed Ali) Jinnah.        
	The shoe attack is the third in nine days in the run-up to the polls but is especially embarrassing because the thrower  unlike those who targeted Chidambaram and Congress MP Naveen Jindal  was a party man.         
	State BJP chief N.S. Tomar termed it deliberate mischief and party general secretary Sushma Swaraj claimed Pawas was not a BJP worker. Local party leaders in Katni and Jabalpur, however, confirmed that he was an office-bearer of the BJPs trader cell.        
	Some BJP leaders claimed Pawas, a former president of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morchas Katni unit, was not of sound mind.        
	Soon after reporter Jarnail Singh had hurled his shoe at the Union home minister on April 7, Madhya Pradeshs director-general of police had warned all district police bosses to be extra vigilant at public meetings and news conferences. But Pawas acted with a swiftness that stunned both the police and BJP workers.        
	Advani was just about to climb on the dais when Pawas, sitting with local party leaders, sprang up and aimed his slipper at the BJP leader.        
	There was complete silence for a second or two. BJP workers said they had never dreamt that a colleague could commit such a dastardly act.        
	I was walking before Advaniji; the incident took place before Advaniji could reach the stage, said Ajay Vishnoi, the party MLA from Jabalpur and a former state minister. From the stage I could see someone from the audience shouting and police personnel taking him away.        
	Unlike Jarnail, forgiven by Chidambaram and let off by the police, Pawas has been arrested and booked under criminal charges ranging from assaulting policemen on duty to posing a threat to public order.        
	While he was being taken away, someone asked him why he had not raised his grievances about Advani at a party forum. No party leader had the courage to communicate these feelings because they too were not allowed to speak, Pawas retorted.        
	A Congress spokesperson said: This is a result of the BJPs doublespeak and its intention to exploit public sentiments in the name of religion.        
	Jarnail, a reporter, had hurled a shoe at Chidambaram at a news conference at the Congress headquarters to protest the CBI clean chit to 1984 riot accused Jagdish Tytler. Jindal came under attack from an allegedly drunken schoolteacher at Kurukshetra, Haryana, who was protesting the state governments job policy.

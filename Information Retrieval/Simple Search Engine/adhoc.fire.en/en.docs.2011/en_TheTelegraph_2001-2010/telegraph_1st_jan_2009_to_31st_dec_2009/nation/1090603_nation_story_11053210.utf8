          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, June 2: Student groups of Ravenshaw University are demanding a rollback of a decision to introduce cut-off marks for specific courses while doing away with admission tests.        
	However, registrar Satyakam Mishra has decided to stick to the university decision and defended it as a prevalent practice in unitary universities across the country.         
	Ravenshaw University currently offers 1,200 seats in graduation courses  science (288), commerce (400) and humanities (512).         
	From now on, according to the eligibility criteria introduced by the university, students with 60 per cent aggregate marks at the Plus-II level would be eligible for admission in graduation courses (science and commerce streams). In the case of humanities, a student will require 50 per cent aggregate marks.

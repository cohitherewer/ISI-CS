          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Nov. 4: The state BJP plunged into turmoil once again with a sizeable section of its legislators demanding the resignation of deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi over his stand on the sharecroppers issue.        
	What triggered the protest, was Modis announcement that in the state bataidars (sharecroppers) and landowners (both) would be entitled to the Kisan credit cards (KCC) and farm loans up to Rs 50,000.         
	Modi added that cultivators would not be required to show land possession certificates (LPC) for claiming a loan amount of Rs 50,000 or less.        
	It appears that Modi has not taken a lesson from BJPs debacle in the by-elections, said senior BJP legislator and former minister Chandramohan Rai, adding: This move will drive a nail in to the NDA coffin.        
	Former Union minister and partys Patna MP, C.P. Thakur, too, described Modis statement as inflammatory that may lead to violence in the hinterland.         
	Over six party legislators met at the residence of Chandramohan Rai demanding Modis resignation and resolving to take up the issue with the BJP high command.        
	The deputy chief minister convened a news conference this afternoon to clarify his stand. The government has no intention, whatsoever, to infringe upon the rights of the landowners, he said, adding: The central government and Nabard have issued guidelines for the KCC and the grant of loans up to Rs 50,000 to the farmers and sharecroppers without asking them to produce LPC.        
	The state government is implementing the Nabard and Centre guidelines, he said, clarifying that BJP had always been the party championing the cause of landholders.         
	It (BJP) will not do anything which interferes with the rights of the landowners in any manner, he said.        
	But Modis clarifications have failed to douse the rebels fire. The dissident leaders pointed out that Union government and Nabard had done a right thing by freeing the farmers from the trouble of producing so many certificates for a loan. It is the Bihar government which has added sharecroppers as the beneficiary of Nabard guidelines. Neither Nabard nor the Centre mentioned sharecropper in their guidelines, said one of the leaders.        
	In fact, BJP rebels gunning for Modis head suggested that the ideological divide between the JD(U) and BJP to change the course of politics in the state. The JD(U) led by Nitish Kumar has extremely backward classes as its core support base. Apparently, the EBCs primarily constitute the sharecroppers who would be benefited if the state allows them to have KCC and loans.        
	But the BJP, as Modi himself admitted, has been the champion of the landowners cause, perennially at war with the land-less in Bihars hinterland.         
	The core of the BJP is opposed to any move that may hinder or be at the cost of the landowners.         
	Modi clarified that there were 21.4 crore landowners in Bihar out of which 92 per cent owned land below five acres. Thus, it is clear that Bihar has a just a minuscule section of farmers owning big farmlands.

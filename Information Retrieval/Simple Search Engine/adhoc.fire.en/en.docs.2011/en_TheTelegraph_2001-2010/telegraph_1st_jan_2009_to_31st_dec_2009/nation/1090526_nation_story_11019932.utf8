	New Delhi, May 25: On the first working day of his fresh term as home minister, three threats were on top of P. Chidambarams mind.        
	Terrorism, Naxalite violence and insurgency in the Northeast are the key challenges before the country. We will raise the level of preparedness to meet the increasing threat to security he said today.        
	He hinted that the BSF might be deployed to tackle the Naxalites. The BSF is not an anti-Naxalite force. (But) if it becomes necessary, yes, as a gap-filling measure, he said, asked if the border force would be pressed into operations.         
	Development, he said, would follow once an area is cleared of Naxalites.        
	He hinted that holding elections in all Naxalite zones in the first phase may have been an unwise move. The Naxalites took advantage of the fact that our forces had been spread throughout the country. But we will respond.         
	Some observers felt that if the polls in all rebel-infested areas were not held together, force deployment could have been managed better.        
	The home minister said the government would put in place a national counter-terrorism centre. The centre, however, will be come into place only after the multi-agency centre, tasked with coordinating intelligence inputs and which Chidambaram himself revived, becomes fully operational.        
	Asked about how the state would deal with insurgents like the Dima Halam Daogah (Jewel Garlasa) in Assam, he said the state would respond to the outfits challenge.

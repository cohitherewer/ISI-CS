The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong list out, Left grins
                                                                                                               Cong list out, Left grins
          JAYANTH JACOB                               
	New Delhi, March 20: The ruling Left in Kerala, though plagued by infighting, may have found a reason to chuckle after seeing the Congress candidates list last night.        
	Many warhorses have made it into the fray. Leaders like P.C. Chacko from Thrissur and K.V. Thomas from Ernakulam, both in their sixties, as well as three sitting MLAs figured on the list, angering youth leaders who had expected better representation.        
	Youth and students activists had hoped 26-year-old Hibi Eden, the national president of the National Students Union of India who is said to be close to Rahul Gandhi, would be picked. That did not happen.        
	In his place, Thomas, who had lost from Ernakulam in 2004, was chosen.        
	Edens omission has sparked protests in some parts of Kerala.         
	Youth Congress state president T. Siddique, who was believed to be in the reckoning till the last moment, was also kept out.         
	Inexperience is often cited as the reason for not fielding youth candidates. But the Kerala activists argued that the present crop of Congress faces in Delhi from the state  A.K. Antony and Vayalar Ravi to name two  had risen to prominence in their thirties through the students movement of the 1950s, so why not now.         
	The CPM has fielded six youth candidates this time. The state has 20 Lok Sabha seats.        
	The Congresss only woman candidate from Kerala, Shanimol Usman, has refused to contest from Kasargod instead of her home seat of Alapuzha.         
	In Thiruvananthapuram, where the high command has fielded Shashi Tharoor, party dissident Vijayan Thomas has also jumped into the fray as an Independent.         
	The dissatisfied youth are, however, just one problem the Congress has.         
	Fielding three sitting MLAs has not gone down well with many workers.         
	The list has angered non-Catholic churches, as they have no representatives on it.        
	No candidates have been picked from almost half of Keralas 14 districts, sources said.         
	State Congress chief Chennithala said: The list decided by the high command is the best, and no dissidence will be entertained.        
	The campaign is yet to pick up momentum but Left sources said the situation seemed to have improved for them and they hoped to give a tougher fight in many seats.         
	The Left won 19 of the 20 seats in 2004  the main reason for its position of strength in Delhi.

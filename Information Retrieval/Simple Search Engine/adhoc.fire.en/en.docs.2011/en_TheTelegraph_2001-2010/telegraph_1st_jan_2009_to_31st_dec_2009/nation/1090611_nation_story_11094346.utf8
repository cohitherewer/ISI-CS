The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nepal PM to revive India-first tradition

	New Delhi, June 10: Nepals new Prime Minister Madhav Nepal is set to restore the long-held convention of making India the head of governments first foreign port of call when he visits New Delhi in the last week of June.         
	His predecessor and Nepals first Maoist Prime Minister, Prachanda, had broken tradition  and ruffled Indian feathers  by choosing Beijing as his first foreign destination.         
	The dates of Nepals visit are yet to be finalised but sources said he was likely to make a two-day visit towards the end of June. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is learnt to have personally invited Nepal for an official visit soon after he was elected.         
	But beyond the symbolic restoration of the India first convention, Delhi must continue to mull the reality of enhanced anti-India sentiment in Nepal, and ways of neutralising it. Indeed, Nepals visit may only serve to churn fresh India-phobia in influential sections of Nepali polity and society which blame Delhi for the crisis that led to Prachandas resignation in early May.         
	Prachanda quit after a protracted wrangle over the chief of the Nepal army, Rukumangad Katawal, whom he wanted to sack presumably in preparation for slowly handing over reins of the armed forces to Maoist commanders. It is well known that Delhi was not only strongly opposed to Katawals removal but actively campaigned against it as well.        
	Indias ambassador in Kathmandu, Rakesh Sood, met Prachanda more than half a dozen times in the run-up to the crisis, and lobbied hard against Katawals ouster. Obdurate on the issue, Prachanda chose to quit office and blamed interventionist foreign powers for the political crisis that ensued.         
	Prachandas close associate and Maoist ideologue, Baburam Bhattarai, went a step forward and named India, especially Delhis bureaucratic class, as responsible for toppling the government. In later statements, Prachanda himself blamed Indian interference and emphasised the need to redefine India-Nepal ties.         
	Delhi believes that Madhav Nepal has brought back a more friendly and convivial regime, but in Nepal itself, the new government is widely seen as a sell-out to Indian interests and intervention. It is a bit of an open secret in Kathmandus political circles that Nepal could not have become Prime Minister without covert canvassing by India among non-Maoist political parties.         
	It took more than a fortnight to convince the Nepali Congress (NC) and Terai-based groups like the Madhesi Janadhikar Forum (MJF) to support Nepal, who belongs to the United Marxist-Leninist (UML) party, a middle-of-the-road communist outfit routed in the 2008 elections. Nepal too was among the defeated, but recovered enough political ground subsequently to become the consensus choice of non-Maoist groups.         
	But having become Prime Minister, Nepals problems havent eased. Two weeks after taking over, he is struggling to meet contrary demands from the NC and the MJF and is yet to fully constitute his government. The Maoists, on the other hand, have returned to the streets and are giving every indication they will make functioning tough. Especially if Madhav Nepal shows signs of leaning towards India.         
	They have obstructed the House, they are calling bandhs and chakka jams in Kathmandu and various other parts of the country, they have made it known they will not take kindly to foreign powers insulting the verdict of the people.         
	Even so, Nepals India visit will be critical to him and to the future of the peace process currently unspooling in the Himalayan nation. He is bound to seek continued support and reassurance in trying to run his government and reconcile the contradictions within.        
	The two sides will also discuss how to deal with the intransigent Maoists and get the process of giving Nepal a new republican constitution back on track. Given the current Maoist anger against India, and those it sees as having sold out to India, it may be tough to get them to co-operate with the business of the Constituent Assembly.         
	The tough issue facing Madhav Nepal today is whether to renegotiate with the former rebels or adopt a more hardline stand and crack down if they resort to violence. The Nepali army is believed to have a bias for the latter option. But that may have its own detrimental consequences for the fragile political peace in Nepal.

                                                                                                               Sanjay in poll ring, with Amar 
          OUR BUREAU                          Sanjay Dutt in Srinagar on Thursday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai/New Delhi, Jan. 8: Munnabhai MP, courts permitting.        
	Sanjay Dutt, whose parents and sister are of Congress vintage, will be the Samajwadi Partys candidate in Lucknow for the Lok Sabha elections provided he gets a stay on his conviction in the 1993 Bombay blasts case.         
	Party general secretary Amar Singh made the announcement in Delhi, but added the rider that in case of legal hurdles, Dutt would be the star campaigner in Lucknow.         
	The seat, which is no stranger to star contestants, is the bastion of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, but the BJP patriarch is unlikely to contest this time.         
	Dutt is out on interim bail after he was convicted and imprisoned for six years under the Arms Act.         
	The Supreme Court has laid down that it is not enough to get bail on a sentence, it is also necessary to get a stay on the conviction itself for contesting elections.        
	Neither the actor, who is shooting in Kashmir, nor wife Manyaata could be reached for comment, but sources close to the family said the decision was the result of his estrangement with sisters Priya and Namrata.         
	The prime reason for Sanjus entry into politics is the rivalry between Manyaata and Priya and Namrata. The sisters stood by Sanju like a rock during his trial. But when Manyaata came into his life and started controlling it, they went into a shell, said a source close to the family.        
	Priya said his brothers decision was his personal choice. I have heard about his candidature. It is his decision if he wants to join the Samajwadi Party. He has always loved being with people. Politics is the best platform for that.

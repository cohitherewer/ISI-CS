The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Security truce to combat Maoists
                                                                                                               Security truce to combat Maoists
          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, Aug. 10: The Chhattisgarh government today stepped in to patch up the rift between the state police and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) in their joint mission to combat Maoist guerrillas in the state.         
	Chief minister Raman Singh chaired a high-level meeting comprising top officials of the state and central security forces on Monday. Both the forces have been blaming the other for lack of co-ordination in anti-Maoist operations.         
	Sources said that the chief minister told the security officers to establish better co-ordination and organise joint operations against the rebels. Singh pointed out that the lack of co-ordination between the forces was ultimately helping the Maoists.         
	In the meeting, sources added, the CRPF and state police officers agreed to sit together before drawing up any strategy for major operations. Strengthening intelligence network was also discussed in the meeting.        
	The state government has decided to set up a committee headed by the chief secretary to look into the matter, Singh told reporters after the meeting.        
	After the Madanwada incident in which 36 security personnel  including Rajnandgaon superintendent of police V.K. Choubey  were killed on July 12, senior police officers have blamed the CRPF for delay in rushing reinforcements. The police reportedly complained to the chief minister about the lapse.         
	However, the CRPF officials refuted the charges and blamed the state police for not co-ordinating.         
	Following the tussle, the CRPF officials had told the state police that it would rush its men only on information developed by its sources and not the police.

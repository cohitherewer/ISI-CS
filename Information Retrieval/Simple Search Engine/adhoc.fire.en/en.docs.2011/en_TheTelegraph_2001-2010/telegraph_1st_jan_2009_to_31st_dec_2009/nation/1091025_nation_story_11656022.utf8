The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | 4 cops held for MBA killing
                                                                                                               4 cops held for MBA killing
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Oct. 24: The CBI today arrested four more Uttarakhand policemen on charges of shooting dead MBA student Ranbir Singh and then trying to pass it off as an encounter over three months ago.        
	The bureau had earlier this month taken into custody four policemen for faking the encounter.         
	CBI sources said those arrested today are all assistant sub-inspectors: Rajendra Bist, S. Nalapuri, Chandra Mohan and Raju Chaudhary.        
	The four policemen arrested today had played an active role in taking Ranbir into custody and later dragging him to a jungle where he was fired at from close range on July 3. Later, they misrepresented facts to their seniors, a CBI officer said in a forwarding remand application filed in a Dehra Dun court today.         
	The court has remanded the four in judicial custody for two weeks.         
	On July 3, the 24-year-old Ranbir, an MBA student from Ghaziabad, was gunned down by Uttarakhand police after he allegedly fled with a sub-inspectors revolver when stopped by the police for a check.        
	But the autopsy report revealed that the young man was shot from close range and may have been tortured before the shooting.        
	The CBI is now preparing to file a complete chargesheet against the policemen in Uttarakhand.         
	I am happy the law is catching up with the policemen in Dehra Dun who killed my son, said Ravinder Pal Singh, Ranbirs father.         
	The saga of fake encounters continued with nine policemen charged with staging a fake encounter 10 years ago moving Allahabad High Court for bail.         
	The nine men are among 30 police personnel against whom arrest warrants have been issued by the sessions court in Bhadohi.

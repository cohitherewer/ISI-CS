The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Malabar Left fort faces siege within
                                                                                                               Malabar Left fort faces siege within
          MANINI CHATTERJEE IN VADAKARA                                            
	Surrounded by Congress workers who are busy tying loose ends to a campaign that is about to end, P.M. Suresh Babu is visibly high on hope. Thats a novel feeling, for hope has been in severe and prolonged short supply for the Congressmen of north Kerala or the Malabar region as it is known.         
	The Vadakara Lok Sabha seat has long been a Left citadel, straddling the two Red districts of Kozhikode (Calicut) and Kannur (Cannanore) and the LDF hasnt lost an election here since 1977.         
	Suresh Babu, now in charge of Congress candidate Mullappally Ramachandrans campaign, contested this seat in 1998 and 1999 and lost both times. In 2004, the CPMs Sathidevi, who has been fielded again, trounced her Congress rival by over 1.3 lakh votes.         
	But this time is different, insists Babu, because the LDF is divided, the Left is divided and the CPM is divided and all these divisions will help the Congress crack the Red bastions in Malabar, starting with Vadakara.         
	On paper, at least, he could be right. The rebellion by the Janata Dal (S) after M.P. Veerendra Kumar was denied the Kozhikode seat will impact most on Vadakara. Veerendra Kumar, who rejected the CPMs offer to contest the new Wayanad seat instead, not only walked out of the LDF but is openly campaigning for the CPMs defeat.         
	Of the five JD(S) MLAs, three have left the LDF along with him and two of them happen to be elected from Assembly segments that fall under the Vadakara constituency. The JD(S) has a minimum of 50,000 votes here and we will get a bulk of them, Babu claims.         
	That is not all. A CPM rebel, T.P. Chandrashekharan, who was expelled in 2007, is also in the field. A number of former CPM members who were either expelled from the party in course of the bitter factional war or chose to distance themselves because of the CPMs right deviationist tendencies held a convention in Shornur on March 15 to float a platform called Edathupaksha Ekopana Samithi (Left Coordination Committee).         
	Chandrashekharan is one of the five candidates put up by this outfit in this election.         
	The Congress calculation is that he will draw around 30,000 votes. The combined JD(S) and Marxist rebel votes, at a time when there is an overall anti-LDF mood in the state, will ensure our victory by at least a half-lakh margin, say Congressmen, jubilant before the votes have even been cast.         
	The Congress is equally hopeful of wresting the Calicut seat next door, again banking on divisions within the LDF and the CPM. The CPMs decision to field an untested young firebrand Mohammad Riyaz hasnt gone down well with sections within the party, coming as it did in the backdrop of the V.S. Achuthanandan versus Pinarayi Vijayan battle whose effects were felt particularly strongly in Calicut district, they claim. The humiliation of sitting MP Veerendra Kumar and the sidelining of VS and his supporters are certain to extract a price.         
	In Kannur, too, the Congress smells a chance because it has fielded K. Sudhakaran, a known muscleman against yet another CPM greenhorn K.K. Rageesh. But party men privately concede that Kannur is a much tougher nut to crack because, unlike Calicut, the CPM organisation is much stronger there and there is greater political polarisation in a seat known for its violent CPM versus RSS as well as CPM versus Congress clashes.         
	If the CPM leadership is worried by this spectre, they certainly betray no signs of it. The buoyancy in the CPM rank and file across this region, in fact, surpasses the exuberance of Suresh Babu and his men.         
	The CPMs campaign-in-charge in Vadakara, P.V. Jayarajan, dismisses the Congresss calculations as just so much poor arithmetic and poorer politics. In the 1991 elections held in the backdrop of the Rajiv Gandhi assassination, we witnessed what is called the Kolibi phenomenon  the coming together of the Congress, Muslim League and the BJP. Todays Kolija (Congress, League and Janata Dal(S)) will meet the same fate, he asserts confidently.         
	As for the dissidents, he describes them as the B team of the UDF and scoffs at the prospect of Chandrashekharan causing any serious dent to the CPM.         
	Jayarajans confidence is echoed by CPM workers in Kannur, Vadakara and Kozhikode. The UDF is going by biased media surveys, we are banking on the feedback of our block-level squads, says Kuttykrishnan in Kannur, a college teacher who  like many people we meet on our drive from Kozhikode to Kannur  makes no bones about his political preferences.         
	One reason for this overt confidence is the big presence of youth in its ranks, and the state leaderships decision to push youth leaders to the forefront. In both Kannur and Kozhikode, the CPMs first-time candidates are well below 40.         
	There have been murmurs of criticism within party circles on the emphasis given to youth over experienced leaders from the peasant or trade union fronts. For the moment, though, it has given a palpable energy and enthusiasm to the campaign. The recent successes in reaching out to the Muslim minority  directly and via Abdul Madhanis PDP  has also added to the CPMs confidence. The additional youth and minority support will more than offset the erosion caused by the desertion of the JD(S) and the rebel factor, party activists feel.         
	Yet, beneath the we will win all seats in Malabar bluster there is a certain sense of disquiet, too. Old timers claim this is the first time that the CPM is facing a challenge from within because the dissidents are not a part of the UDF and have supporters within the party ranks. Unlike famous rebels like M.V. Raghavan or K. Gowriamma who left the party to join the UDF, the current rebellion is more in the nature of internal haemorrhage than an outright amputation.         
	No one is quite sure of the nature or extent of this siege within. Nor whether and how it will play out in the elections. And this uncertainty fuels both the Congresss hopes and the CPMs confidence for the time being.         
	 Vadakara votes on April 16

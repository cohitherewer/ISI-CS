The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | After loss, Jaya takes a break
                                                                                                               After loss, Jaya takes a break
          G.C. SHEKHAR                                            
	Chennai, May 30: Poll defeats after a hectic summer campaign can be a blessing in disguise. You can take off on a holiday  as Jayalalithaa did today.        
	The ADMK chief left for her estate in Kodanadu near Ooty in the Nilgiris, boarding a special flight to Coimbatore before taking a helicopter to reach the hill station for a month of relaxation.        
	In Jayalalithaas diary, however, holidays tend to get prolonged. During her last trip to Kodanadu in February 2008, she stayed there for more than three months even as the DMK expelled the PMK from its front and the Left withdrew support to the UPA government over the nuclear deal.        
	Although ensconced in the cooler climes of the hill station, Jayalalithaa never gave the impression that she was politically cut off as she kept issuing statements almost every day and directing her party to hold protests on various issues.        
	Unlike in the past, when Jayalalithaa used to sulk after a poll defeat, this time she did a quick assessment of her partys reverses. She called a meeting of party executive members on May 27 and spent two hours analysing the reasons for the defeat.        
	It is not just the money power of the DMK alone but also the laid-back approach of many of our election managers that resulted in our defeat, she told the members.        
	When several speakers said they didnt have enough money to match the DMKs spending capacity, Jayalalithaa reportedly told them she had no money to spend for elections and could not compete with the DMK on this front as it was in power at both the Centre and in the state.        
	But many district secretaries were heard murmuring later that they had collected Rs 30 crore as election funds and wondering what had happened to that. Possibly most of it was spent in paying the bills for chartering helicopters and private jets, quipped an MLA, alluding to Jayalalithaas flying election campaign.        
	Aiyar brave face        
	Former Union minister Mani Shankar Aiyar, who lost from Mayiladuthurai, has told PTI that the defeat was disappointing but he had taken it in his stride.        
	In politics, success and defeat are quite common, the former panchayati raj minister, who is on a tour of the constituency to thank voters, said.

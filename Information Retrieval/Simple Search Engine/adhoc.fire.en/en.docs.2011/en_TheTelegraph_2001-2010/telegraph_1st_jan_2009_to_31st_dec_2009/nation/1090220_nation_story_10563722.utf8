          RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR                          Salman shoots for Veer in Jaipur on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	Jaipur, Feb. 19: Renovation of the once-mighty Amer Fort could have a huge casualty: its heritage.        
	The work, being carried out by the state government-controlled Amer Development and Management Authority, is being billed as an effort to make the fort a beehive of commercial activity that would earn revenue for its upkeep.        
	Construction of Amer (also known as Amber) Fort, a blend of Hindu and Mughal architecture, was started by Raja Man Singh in 1592 and completed by Sawai Jai Singh I.         
	Some experts say the Rs 40-crore restoration started during Vasundhara Rajes regime is changing the forts look.         
	The roof, called ladau chaath, in one part of the fort made of limestone and mortar mix was rebuilt using small pieces of Kota stones, changing the ancient technology and weakening the structure.        
	The unit of Veer starring Salman Khan, whose shooting was stalled following a wall collapse injuring 15, had put up its set on this weak roof. The high court today allowed shooting for four days.        
	Jaleb Chowk, the main entry to the fort, has been turned into a concrete floor of Dholpur stones, replacing the uneven Karauli stones and giving it a regular look.        
	Several shops, an art gallery, fashion design outlets and coffee shops have opened inside and work is on for a restaurant and bar. There are also plans to rent out Amer for weddings for at least Rs 5 crore.        
	A former director of archaeology, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said much of the renovation work violates the Rajasthan Monuments, Archaeological Sites and Antiquities Act of 1961.         
	He pointed out that electrical transformers, ACs, a wide network of cable and electric wires, alterations in old doors and windows, walls and floors have changed the forts appearance. This, he said, could be listed as an infringement under Section 17 of the Act, which calls for penalties for damages and alterations to the original structure.         
	Amer Fort superintendent Zafarullah Khan disagreed. Everything is being done according to rules and regulations. We have work orders for everything, he said.        
	The renovation has also hit local residents who earned their living from Amer, some for over 60 years. The fort authorities evicted them.        
	Bansuriwalan Gafoor Chacha, 85, has been selling his wooden flutes ever since Raja Man Singh II retained him in the 1940s. He is now out of work. So are Babulal Namkeenwala and Goverdhan Das Nimbupaniwala. Mithan Sindhi, whose sweet shop is 58 years old, was shifted out.        
	Khan said: Under ASI rules, no commercial activity is allowed within historical monuments. For the big shops, we have issued them licenses.

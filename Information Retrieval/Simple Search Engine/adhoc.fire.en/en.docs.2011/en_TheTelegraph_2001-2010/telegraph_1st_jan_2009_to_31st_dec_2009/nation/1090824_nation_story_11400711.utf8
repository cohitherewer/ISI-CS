	Lucknow, Aug. 23: A leader of Uttarakhands ruling BJP was shot dead last night in a Nainital police station, allegedly by a political rival, sparking a rampage by a mob that burnt a constable alive and beat up six others.        
	BSP leader Niraj Tiwari, with whom the slain Balwant Singh Kanyal, 36, is said to have got into a brawl before fleeing to the police station, has been arrested. Chief minister Ramesh Pokhriyal has ordered a magisterial probe.        
	The government later suspended all personnel on duty at the police station in Kaladhungi, in Nainitals Haldwani, where Kanyal, a BJP block president, was shot dead, said a spokesperson for Pokhriyal.        
	The announcements came after hours of arson this morning by Kanyals supporters and relatives.        
	The protesters blocked highways around Nainital for several hours till late this afternoon, leaving hundreds of tourists, mainly from Delhi and some from Calcutta, stranded. They kept Kanyals body on one of the highways before cremating him in the evening after promise of action.        
	The angry supporters torched the police station in Kaladhungi and a dozen vehicles, including those of the police and the state roadways corporation. The mob beat up head constable Puranlal before tossing him into the inferno.         
	Puranlal was declared dead in hospital, senior superintendent of police Mohan Singh Bangyal said. Eight persons, including six police personnel, were injured in the violence that spread to several other areas, Bangyal added.        
	The Rapid Action Force was deployed and personnel of the states Provincial Armed Constabulary conducted flag marches in Haldwani town and several other pockets, Bangyal said.        
	The police said Kanyal was sitting with four friends in a restaurant last night when some half a dozen armed men led by Tiwari, 41, walked in.        
	There were heated exchanges, followed by a scuffle. When Kanyal saw things slip out of his control, he escaped and reached Kaladhungi police station to take shelter. The BSP men followed him there, said Raj Tamta, a police officer in Haldwani.        
	Tamta claimed the personnel at the police station were under the impression that the two sides had come to settle a dispute and Kanyal was shot dead before they could react.        
	BJP leaders alleged that the attack took place at the behest of Tiwari, a political rival with whom Kanyal had a long-running feud.

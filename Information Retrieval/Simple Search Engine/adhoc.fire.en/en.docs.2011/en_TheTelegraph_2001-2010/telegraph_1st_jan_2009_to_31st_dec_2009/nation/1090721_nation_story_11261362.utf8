The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Modi to depend on bank aid
                                                                                                               Modi to depend on bank aid
                            
	Patna, July 20 (PTI): Bihars NDA government will borrow Rs 7,061 crore from banks during the current fiscal (2009-10) to implement several development projects, according to deputy chief minister-cum-finance minister S.K. Modi.        
	Replying to a starred-question of V.N. Jha (BJP) in the Assembly, Modi said it was not not possible at this stage to free the state from loans from financial institutions. He said that the government had realised loans to the tune of Rs 4,834 crore during 2008-09.        
	The declining projections in central allocations has left the government with the only option to borrow funds for its proposed expenditure plan of Rs 16,000 crore for the current fiscal.        
	We have to borrow because central allocations are expected to dip by Rs 5,000 crore this fiscal. We have no further option.        
	Modi further clarified that the plan size had been downsized to Rs 12,000 crore in the midst of the 2009-10 fiscal due to the curtailment in central allocations by Rs 2,052.54 crore against the total projections of Rs 19,741 crore. He said that the projections of lower share of revenue coming from the central pool to Bihar this year was a cause for worry.        
	Earlier, replying to another starred-question by Lalit Kumar Yadav (RJD), Modi said there was no proposal before the government to raise retirement age from 60 years to 62 years.

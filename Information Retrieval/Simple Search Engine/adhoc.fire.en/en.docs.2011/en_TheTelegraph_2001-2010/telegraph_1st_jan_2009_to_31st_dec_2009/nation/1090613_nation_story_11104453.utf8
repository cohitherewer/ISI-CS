The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Obama eye on Indian kids 
                                                                                                               Obama eye on Indian kids 
                            
	Chicago, June 12 (PTI): US President Barack Obama today emphasised the need for improving the countrys education system so its students could compete with Indian and Chinese children who spend more time in school and less time playing video games.         
	Obama said that while America once produced the highest number of school and college graduates, PhDs, engineers and scientists, it had fallen behind now and was no longer head and shoulders above other countries when it (comes) to education.         
	We have got to pick up the pace because the world has gotten competitive. The Chinese, the Indians are coming at us and they are coming at us hard, and they are hungry and they are really buckling down, Obama said at a town hall meeting in Wisconsin.         
	Their (Indian and Chinese) kids watch a lot less TV than our kids do, play a lot fewer video games, they are in the classroom a lot longer.        
	At present, the US is in the middle and had settled into mediocrity among wealthy, advanced, industrialised countries. American kids were falling behind in science and math, Obama said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Seething frontiers waiting to erupt
                                                                                                               Seething frontiers waiting to erupt
  - In Vadodara, ripped by riots too often, conversations reveal scars as old as 1969        SANKARSHAN THAKUR IN VADODARA                           Congress president Sonia Gandhi campaigns in Vadodara. (File picture)                                         
	The taxi man isnt ready to go any further. Champaner Gate? Nai saab, apun kaa jaan kaa bhi to fikr hai; biwi, baal-bachcha hai, nai saab, yahin chhodo. (No sir, I have a life and a family, no sir, just leave me here.) Champaner Gate, a humongous 15th-century limestone passage squatting mid-street, marked like a frontier in his head; he wouldnt cross it.         
	So we walked the teeming rivulet lanes of the old and walled Baroda, a crazy baroque of medieval finery embossed with coarse masonry; carved timber held together by garish tiling, a block of cement smothering evidence of a fallen balustrade, a rusty water-cooler rammed into what was once some refined Parsis gable, style choked by substance.         
	We returned late afternoon near-swayed by the intransigent drivers reasoning.         
	Champaner Gate isnt so much the opening on a wizened town breathing through layer upon layer of coexistent time. It is more a gash repeatedly cleaved in the minds of its people. 1969. 1971. 1978. 1982. 1983. 1987. 1991. 1992. 1993. 1995. 1998. 2000. 2002. 2002 again and again. 2005. April 2006. Dont risk consolation that three years have passed since the trouble, warns Prabal Masalawala, an established spice trader in the bustling bazaar. It could erupt anytime, a squabble over kites can unleash war here.         
	Violence has ripped and ravaged them too often and too savagely for sutures to work.         
	Old Baroda isnt a town; its an eruption of seething frontiers mined with malevolence. Prejudice, hatred, anger, suspicion, distrust, bitter memory, vile and vicious myth. Start a conversation in the Muslim mohalla and they begin revealing scars as old as 1969. Start a conversation in the Hindu quarter round the bend in the gali and they take you to Somnath and that ma******* Mahmud Ghazni whose wicked progeny all Muslims are. Put a step wrong and you could trigger a cluster bomb thats forever short on fuse.         
	A week after the last blaze of 2006  sparked by the ill and premeditated razing of the teeny shrine of Sufi Rashiduddin Chishti that stood in the lee of Champaner Gate  a peace march had briefly trickled through the embers. Relations of a slain Muslim, relations of a slain Hindu. Community leaders window-dressed to their dhotis and skullcaps. Candles in their palms, slogans calling halt and peace on the placards. A group of 20-odd in a city of two million, a pinhead in a cannon hole, doves blundering in a slaughterhouse.         
	Ask J.S. Bandukwala, professor of physics at Sayaji Rao University and surely Vadodaras most scarred veteran of good sense, what it feels like to plead the middle ground.         
	Peace and harmony and non-violence and Gandhi are such misnomers for this place. Look at me. Hindus hate me just because I am a Muslim. Muslims hate me because I dont cry their apocalyptic slogans and because my children are free to marry Hindus. There are fires on both sides. At least two generations have no memory of peace or harmonious living.         
	Social worker Ishaq Chinwalas third-floor window in Mughalwada is a handy viewing gallery on old Barodas siege within. Not least because chilled mango panna from the Chinwala kitchen comes with the viewing. The drink is a godsend in the ochre inferno of April, the view is quite another thing.         
	A hectic, almost leprous spread of concrete rising, gorge-like, from the maze of lanes. Kalupura (Hindu), Fatehpura (Muslim), Nawabazar (Hindu), Yakutpura (Muslim), Hathikhana (Hindu), Dargah (Muslim), Baajwada (Hindu), Chaukhandi (mixed), Mandvi (mixed), Ladwada (Hindu), Dosumian Ki Chal (mixed), Suleimani Pole (Muslim), Jehangirpura (mixed). Jowl biting cheek.         
	And how are you to know one from the other in this warren? They put out flags to mark territory and frontier, tied to bamboo poles and poked high into the sky  the green standard for Muslim neighbourhoods, saffron for the Hindus. And quite often, almost merged with them, the rising spires of mosques and temples, competing for numbers, competing for stature on the skyline.         
	The freshly put out banners of continued prosperity and a new peace  colourful tendrils of the electoral war between Narendra Modi and the Congress  lie almost lost and unheeded in the churn of daily friction.        
	Bahut election aaye aur gaye, kuchh nahin badla, says Jignesh Kankariya, a Hathikhana trader, roz ka len-den hai donon ka aur roz ki tension, par karen kya, donon ko yaheen rehna hai aur marna hai. (Many elections have come and gone, nothing has changed. Our lives are meshed, we have to do business with each other, but there are also daily tensions, but whats to be done? We have to live here and die here.         
	Chinwala, 72, says he has lived constantly aghast these past decades, but thats not unusual. He is a dyed-in-the-khadi Gandhian who would die clutching his principles if he had to; beside the Quran in his little study-cum-living room lies the Gita, on his bald pate hed rather sport a Gandhi-topi than a skullcap.         
	I feel increasingly lonely and marginalised and the way things are, and I will probably die alone, but I cannot comprehend the madness of the world around me, he says. Everyone is becoming more fundamentalist. Down in the streets, they are asking Muslim women to shun saris because Hindu women wear them and Hindus are telling each other to build a temple in each home because they are greater in number. Everything has gone to the mullah and the pandit, Gods are doing culture police duty, gods are turning landlords.         
	A clamour of bande mataram kehna hoga rises from below  a saffron column is weaving through  and the doorframes hugging the narrow lanes are shutting one after another.

                                                                                                               Reckless driving led to mishap
  - Bus swept away by flash   flood in Nayagarh, 7 dead        OUR BUREAU                                          
	Bhubaneswar, July 14: An obstinate driver of a bus turned deaf ears to warnings from passengers and decided to ply the vehicle on a partly submerged bridge only to be swept away by a ravenous river during last nights flash flood at Madhyakhand near Daspalla in Nayagarh district.        
	The ill-fated bus jumped off the bridge submerged under 3ft water, killing seven passengers. Driver Sadhu Charan Swain, however, managed to escape. He and his helper are absconding.        
	Eyewitnesses said that the bridge  built over a small storm water drain  did not have guard walls on either side. Despite words of caution from passengers, the adamant driver took the risk of running the bus over the bridge in the hilly region around 9pm. While wading through it, the bus fell into the storm water drain and was swept away, said Sumanta Jena, who survived the ordeal in the bus.        
	Nayagarh has been receiving heavy rainfall for the past couple of days. The Met office recorded 35cm of rainfall in the past 24 hours. At the time of the mishap, floodwater was flowing 3ft above the bridge, Jena said.        
	The current was so strong that it swept away the 10-tonne passenger bus carrying more than 40 passengers, officials in the water resources department said. In such cases, drivers should not take the risk of taking the vehicles ahead, said retired motor vehicle inspector Dhirendra Nath Das.        
	Disaster management minister Surya Narayan Patro said a directive had been issued by the department asking all the drivers to avoid running vehicles on bridges submerged under floodwater.        
	There will be a thorough inquiry to find out whether there were any lapses, which led to the mishap, said the minister, adding that the police had been instructed to arrest the owner and driver of the bus. The disaster management department has also asked drivers not to drive vehicle in an inebriated condition, sources said.         
	Following the mishap, the state government today declared a compensation of Rs 1 lakh each to the families of the deceased. Each family will be given an ex-gratia of Rs 1 lakh and the injured will be given free treatment, said Patro.        
	The deceased have been identified as Sarojini Dash and her daughter Kandhei, Gumani Nayak, Ranjan Bhanja, Gatikrushna Rana, Sudarsan Hota and Kalia Dash. The bodies have been taken for autopsy and the injured persons were admitted in the nearby hospital at Daspalla.        
	Rescue operations have been going on since last night. However, the rescuers faced difficulty in darkness in the tragedy site. An Orissa Disaster Rapid Action Force (Odraf) team has been pressed into service.         
	The water has receded making the bus more visible, but we are yet to tow it out of the drain. A crane is on its way and hopefully the bus will be taken out soon, said Benudhar Mallick, an Odraf staff.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Beat office blown up in Gajapati
                                                                                                               Beat office blown up in Gajapati
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, July 10: After a brief lull, Naxalites blew up a beat office at Paniganda in Gajapati district at 2pm late last night.        
	Fifty armed Maoists, including women, swooped down on the beat office under Adaba police area of Mohana block and dragged out the forest guard manning the house and tied him to a tree. The women then reportedly ransacked the house before blowing it up using detonators, said inspector-in-charge of Adaba police station N. Kero.        
	Three villagers were injured in the incident, two of them seriously. The injured have been identified as Jugal Dandasena, Prashant Paik and Dibakar Gadanayak, who were rushed to Adaba hospital, police said.        
	The rebels finally left after felling trees along the Daringbadi-Berhampur and Sunabeda-Chandrapur roads.         
	Meanwhile, security was beefed up in rebel-hit districts after a Maoist bandh call.         
	Demanding the immediate release of their cadre staying behind bars, the state CPI(Maoist) called a 12-hour bandh today.         
	Letters regarding the demand were earlier despatched to the media, whereas posters carrying the name of leader Sabyasachi were pasted in town and village squares.        
	A number of innocent men have been arrested on charges of spreading so-called Left-wing terrorism in the state.         
	All of them have to be released at the earliest. Those involved in the riots at Raikia in Kandhamal district should surrender at the earliest, else they would be punished like the Swamiji, the letters stated.        
	Rebels chose rural districts in Ganjam, Gajapati and Kandhamal districts to paste their posters.         
	The bandh, however, received little response as normal life continued as usual in most districts barring Rayagada. At Rayagada, vehicles kept off the roads and most shops remained closed throughout the day.

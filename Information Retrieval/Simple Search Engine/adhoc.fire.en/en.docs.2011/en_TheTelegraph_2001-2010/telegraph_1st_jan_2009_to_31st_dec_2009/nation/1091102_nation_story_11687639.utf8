          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Imphal, Nov. 1: Seven suspected militants were killed in an encounter near Imphal last night, hours after the death of three jawans in an ambush by rebels.        
	Which group the slain rebels belonged to wasnt known, but the families of two identified so far claimed the duo were drivers who had been taken away from their houses by gun-wielding persons on October 22.         
	They families of Oinam Anand Singh, 25, and Oinam Pakpak Singh, 23, have refused to take the bodies, saying they suspect foul play in the encounter with 28 Assam Rifles troops.        
	The three jawans killed  one of them, lance naik Arup Kumar, was from Bengal  in the ambush by United National Liberation Front (UNLF) earlier yesterday belonged to the same paramilitary force, though from a different unit, 43 Assam Rifles.        
	The encounter, which lasted four hours from 11.30pm, occurred in the hilly Andro Sanapat area, 22km from Imphal town, when the forces received a tipoff and accosted the rebels.         
	Four of the suspected militants killed were in battle fatigues. Two AK-47 rifles, four pistols, two hand grenades, ammunition and some explosives were found on them.         
	The jawans killed in the UNLF ambush in Chandel district were part of a recce team sanitising the roads for a larger contingent scheduled to pass through the area, an army spokesperson said. Assam Rifles is under the armys operational command despite being a paramiltary force.        
	The UNLF claimed responsibility in a release issued shortly after the ambush but said it had killed seven, not three, troopers.         
	It isnt unusual for rebels in the state to claim higher soldier casualties.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | DMK sniffs larger slice
                                                                                                               DMK sniffs larger slice
          G.C. SHEKHAR                               
	Chennai, May 18: The DMK is looking for more cabinet berths on the strength of having stood by the Congress when several allies had deserted it. M. Karunanidhi may hand the wish list to Sonia Gandhi in Delhi tomorrow.        
	Now that the PMK, the party of former health minister Anbumani Ramadoss and former minister of state for railways R. Velu, is out of the UPA, the DMK wants these two berths in addition to those it held last time. Karunanidhis son M.K. Azhagiri was initially eyeing railways but is apparently willing to settle for shipping and highways, now held by T.R. Baalu.         
	Baalu could be in line for the power ministry. For daughter Kanimozhi, a Rajya Sabha member, Karunanidhi may seek the health ministry.        
	Dayanidhi Maran wants back communications but the DMK patriarch is a bit reluctant. A. Rajas name is likely to be suggested for railways and not communications because of the spectrum controversy during his stint. Four of the DMK ministers of state did not contest the elections, so new faces are expected.

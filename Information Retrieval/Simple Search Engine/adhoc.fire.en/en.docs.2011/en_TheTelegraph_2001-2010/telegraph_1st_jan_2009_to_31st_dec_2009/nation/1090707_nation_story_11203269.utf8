The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tornado victims ignored
                                                                                                               Tornado victims ignored
                            
	Bhubaneswar, July 6 (PTI): Terming the budget as a routine document, Orissa finance minister Prafulla Ghadai today said it was devoid of innovative programmes or provisions to spur economic growth.        
	It is a routine budget. There is nothing new about the budget that lacks provisions and programmes to accelerate growth, Ghadai told reporters shortly after Pranab Mukherjee presented the budget for 2009-10 in the Lok Sabha.        
	The budget has no provision for Orissa, whereas states such as Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu have been given a special treatment, he said. Some Rs 1,000 crore has been allocated for those affected by Aila, while the tornado-hit people of Rajnagar area (Orissa) have been ignored, he pointed out.

          BASANT RAWAT                       Modi                          
	Ahmedabad, Dec. 19: The Gujarat Assembly today passed a bill making voting mandatory in elections to local self-government bodies, the landmark legislation coming under scrutiny from constitutional experts who said it violated the principles of freedom of expression.         
	A brainchild of chief minister Narendra Modi, the controversial legislation, called Gujarat Local Authorities Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2009, will now have to be approved by the governor and the President for it to become law.         
	The bill also seeks to raise the reservation of seats for women in local self-government bodies from 33 to 50 per cent.        
	Under the legislation, a person who fails to vote for reasons other than those mentioned on the list of exemptions would be declared a defaulter. Penal clauses will be introduced for which rules will be framed later.        
	It is observed that due to low turnout of voters to discharge their duty by exercising their right to vote, the true spirit of the will of the people is not reflected in the electoral mandate, said the bills statement of objects and reasons.        
	The Congress was against clubbing the two provisions  compulsory voting and raising of womens reservation  in the same bill. The party said it opposed compulsory voting, but said it was for an enhanced womens quota since it was a progressive idea.        
	Voting is a right, not duty, said Congress legislature party leader Shaktisinh Gohil.        
	With the Congress opposing it, the bill was passed in the Assembly by voice vote today, the last day of the winter session.        
	Modi, who was absent from the House during the debate, defended the bill, saying: Democracy will become more participatory.        
	We are ready to sit and discuss with everyone  academics and the Opposition  to frame the rules and work out the details about how to go about it, Modi told reporters on the Assembly premises.         
	Social scientist Tridip Suhrud debunked the theory of low voter turnout in local elections. He said the average voting percentage in these elections was around 70, nearly 15 to 20 percentage points higher than those in Assembly and Lok Sabha polls.         
	Constitutional expert Anand Yagnik said the legislation amounted to taking away a citizens fundamental right.        
	The right to vote is a part of freedom of expression, guaranteed in the Constitution. Freedom of expression gives the right to vote, and not to vote as well, he said.        
	Political observers said Modi wanted to further entrench himself in the state, given that the BJPs performance in the Lok Sabha polls had been below expectations.        
	The BJPs superior organisational structure means that it can mobilise more voters, Suhrud said.

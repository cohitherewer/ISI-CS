The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nawab kin challenge to Monaco heir
                                                                                                               Nawab kin challenge to Monaco heir
          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                              
	Lucknow, July 21: Nawab Wajid Ali Shahs descendants in Calcutta have written to the French embassy to stop a Monaco-based woman from using the family name to raise funds worldwide.        
	Fay Ary claims to have been married to a great-grandson of Shah (1822-87), a great patron of the arts who ruled Awadh in Uttar Pradesh for nine years before the British deposed and exiled him to Calcutta in 1856.        
	Now married to a German businessman  Ary says her royal husband died long ago  she calls herself Her Royal Highness Princess Fay Ary and, alternatively, Princess Jahanara.        
	Madame Fay appeared on the scene in 2007. For obvious reasons, she refuses to reveal the name of her late husband. As far as we know, she has no connection with the royal families of Awadh, said Shahs descendant Wasif Ali Mirza from Calcutta.        
	Mirza, president of the Oudh Royal Family Association, is a signatory to the letter sent to French ambassador Jerome Bonnafont on Friday. It says: Mrs Fay Ary of Villa-Serena Avenue Dusemaphore MC 9800, Monaco, has set up the Royal Avadh Cultural and Heritage (RACH) Foundation that hosts dinners to raise money for charity.        
	The letter alleges that at one such dinner in Paris, on May 29 this year, she auctioned her personal jewellery and charged a hefty amount from her guests. The foundation plans another event in September in Dubai.        
	A well-known fashion designer from Mumbai had organised a ramp show at the Paris dinner.         
	A few donors and hotel officials from Lucknow too had been guests.        
	The Shah familys letter says: Fay promises to help promote the culture of Lucknow but all her activities are being held in far-off places. It has never taken place in Lucknow or Calcutta. We assume that she is scared of being exposed.        
	The RACH foundations website says it endeavours to protect and restore the cultural heritage of Lucknow and its province, recover the history of the Kingdom of Oudh from oblivion, and promote in general the cultural and social reality of India in western countries.        
	It says its objectives are to help poor students, promote handicrafts, attract foreigners to India starting in Lucknow, renovate Indian monuments, help municipalities and organise exchange students between schools in Lucknow, Calcutta and Lyon (in France).        
	We do not know who are the beneficiaries of her money. She has created an honorary committee and has listed the names of a few individuals without taking their consent. Surprisingly, many of them are not even aware of it, the letter alleges.        
	Shahs descendant Humayun Mirza, mentioned as a patron in some of the foundations documents, said from Calcutta: I have no idea about RACH. I dont know how my name was put there.        
	The letter caps a war of emails between Arys associates and Shahs descendants.                     
	Referring to this, Ary had last June written to one of her associates in Lucknow, tour operator Prateek Heera: I ignore such emails that have grown now after our foundation was thoroughly successful in Paris and request my patrons to ignore those who are complaining.

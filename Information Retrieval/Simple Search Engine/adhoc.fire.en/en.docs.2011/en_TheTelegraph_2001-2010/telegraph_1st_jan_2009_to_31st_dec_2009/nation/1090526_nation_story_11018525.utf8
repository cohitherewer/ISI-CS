          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Rain lashes the capital city on Monday. (Sanjib Mukherjee)                                  
	Bhubaneswar, May 25: The cyclone, Aila, formed over the Bay of Bengal intensified further triggering early onset of the south-west monsoon in parts of coastal Orissa.        
	India Meteorological Department today declared the onset of south-west monsoon over Orissa, a fortnight earlier than usual.         
	The south-west monsoon advanced into parts of north coastal Orissa on May 25, 2009, an official release stated.        
	Normal life was thrown out of gear in the coastal belt as heavy rains lashed Orissa for the third day today. As Aila intensified further over north-west Bay of Bengal, the weather office forecasted more thundershower at most places over north Orissa and many places over south Orissa in the next 24 hours.        
	A special bulletin issued by the department said the cyclonic storm had moved north-north-eastwards, intensified further into a severe storm and now lay centred over north-west Bay of Bengal, close to south-east of Sagar Island. The system is likely to move further in a north-north-easterly direction and cross the Bengal coast near Sagar Island today in the evening.         
	Life remained disrupted in parts of coastal Orissa as heavy rains accompanied by high velocity wind pounded several areas. The incessant showers since Saturday night left many low-lying areas in Cuttack, Bhadrak, Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapara and Balasore inundated.         
	Rain damaged huts and led to the loss of crops as agriculture land was submerged. A large number of trees were uprooted and branches broken in Jagatsinghpur and Cuttack as winds with a speed of 100-km-ph swept the coast, blocking roads and disrupting traffic.        
	Meanwhile, cyclone shelter centres were set up at Jagatsinghpur and the administration initiated steps to move uprooted trees that blocked roads to ensure normal vehicle movement. However, no loss of life was reported, yet, while people residing in low-lying areas were evacuated to safer places.        
	Waterlogging affected traffic in Cuttack, Paradip and Jagatsinghpur, giving a tough time to office-goers. Electricity was hit in Bhubaneswar, while the administration put up a high alert warning to prevent incidents.         
	Bhubaneswar city received mm of rainfall since last night, enough to disrupt normal life. Capitals roads were inundated especially low-lying areas such as Acharya Vihar, Bamikhal, Pokhariput and Nayapalli.         
	Meanwhile storm warning signal number-7 was hoisted at Chandbali Port, signal number-5 was put up at Paradip Port and signal number-3 was hoisted at Gopalpur and Puri Ports. Winds reaching 100-120-km-ph are likely to prevail along the north Orissa coast during the next six hours. Winds with speed of 50-60-km-ph, gusting to 70-km-ph, are likely to prevail along south Orissa coast during the same period. Sea condition will be rough along and off the Orissa coast, said Met officials.        
	The weathermen have also predicted extensive damage to thatched huts and damage to power and communication lines in the coastal districts of north Orissa. They have also warned of possible flooding of escape routes in north Orissa. Coastal dwellers have been asked to move to a safer place. Fishermen have been advised to not venture into the sea.

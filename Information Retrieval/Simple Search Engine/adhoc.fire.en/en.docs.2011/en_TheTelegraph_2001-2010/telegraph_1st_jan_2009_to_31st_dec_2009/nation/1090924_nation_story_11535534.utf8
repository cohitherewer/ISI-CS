The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Air force rank worry
                                                                                                               Air force rank worry
                            
	Gandhinagar, Sept. 23 (PTI): Few promotions in the Indian Air Force are prompting pilots to seek voluntary retirement, Air Chief Marshal P.V. Naik said here today.        
	Naik revealed that over 100 pilots had applied for premature retirement because of lack of career growth. The number could go up once the economic downturn ends, he added.         
	Off hand, I can tell you that we have over 100 applications for VRS (voluntary retirement scheme) from pilots, the IAF chief told reporters.         
	We have a very steep pyramid structure (in the air force) where there are fewer avenues for promotions. When one does not get a promotion after 24-25 years of service, one wants to leave and try alternative avenues, he said.         
	Since there is a slump in the market outside, there are fewer applications. Once the slump is over the (number of) applications might increase.

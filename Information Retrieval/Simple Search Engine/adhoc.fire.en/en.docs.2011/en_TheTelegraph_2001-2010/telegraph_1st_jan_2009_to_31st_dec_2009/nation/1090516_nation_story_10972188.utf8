The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Shut in, with food amp; drink
                                                                                                               Shut in, with food amp; drink
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA IN HYDERABAD                              
	Raat me bar, subah me durbar (Bar at night, meetings by day). What actress and Telugu Desam leader Roja said about Telengana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao looks like coming true for many of his colleagues.        
	All the 63 party candidates in the Lok Sabha and Assembly polls were herded into the three-acre compound of the party headquarters in upscale Banjara Hills this evening.        
	The objective is to prevent poaching after the results are announced tomorrow, but Rao has made arrangements for a gala time for the 100-odd people  candidates and top party officials  camping in Telengana Bhavan.        
	Bhavan staff were busy this morning bringing in blankets, pillows, air coolers, cutlery, cartons of ice-cream, fruits, meat, and bottles of mineral water and liquor.        
	With several popular eateries nearby, the staff will have no problem fetching hot food, especially the pepper chilli chicken that Rao is known to relish with his favourite whisky brand. Not to take chances, a Chinese cook and a Mughlai food caterer have been hired.        
	Rao, who arrived from Delhi this evening and made straight to Telengana Bhavan, had said: All of us will stay together, and sail or sink together, in 48 hours from May 15 evening.         
	We have enough food and beverage stocks to last five days, said Manoj, an office assistant at Telengana Bhavan.        
	Desam and actor Chiranjeevis Praja Rajyam too have set up their own camps. All Praja Rajyam leaders and the 300 party candidates have been escorted by private security guards to secret locations  farmhouses, resorts and hotels booked in advance.         
	One of the locations appears to be the farmhouse of actor Pavan Kalyan, brother of Chiranjeevi, and another a small highway resort owned by a Telugu film personality.        
	We have also hired a studio in the city where we will put up some of our candidates, said Chiranjeevis brother-in-law Allu Aravind.        
	Please understand our problem and do not chase our vehicles or investigate, pleaded spokeswoman Shoba Rani.        
	The Desam camp is the new, three-storey building on the compound of the party headquarters, where it is now showing old N.T. Rama Rao blockbusters. All the parties say they would hold quiz contests and indoor games.        
	We have told candidates not to bring their spouses and children, TRS leader Madhusudhanachari said.

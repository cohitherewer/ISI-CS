          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Cuttack, March 10: The administration has ordered removal of banners offering rice for Rs 2 a kg and featuring chief minister Naveen Patnaik in villages of Jagatsinghpur district because they violate the model code of conduct.        
	The order was issued after Congress leader and Baliguda MLA Umesh Swain sought intervention of the state election commission against the unabashed display of hundreds of such banners in several villages in Naugaon by the ruling government to generate public support for BJD and its leaders.        
	The banners were also displayed at PDS outlets and other public places. Block officials in the Naugaon area have been directed to execute the order and ensure removal of the banners, Jagatsinghpur sub-collector Muralidhar Mallick said.        
	Sources in the district election office revealed that Swain had alleged that in Raghunathpur, the model code of conduct had been violated by inaugurating a statue of late Biju Patnaik to mark his birth anniversary on March 5. The government reportedly spent Rs 5 lakh from the MLA Local Area Development fund for the 8ft bronze statue unveiled at Raghunathpur Bazaar.        
	BJD leaders, including former school and mass education minister Bishnu Das, Kissanagar MLA Pratap Jena and Debashis Samantaray, participating in the inaugural ceremony had apparently sought public support for the election.        
	Other instances of alleged violation of the model code of conduct was the inauguration of a bridge at Samantrapur village under Jagatsinghpur block.         
	Though local MLA Bishnu Das, who was scheduled to inaugurate the bridge stayed away, panchayat samiti chairman Kanakprava Lenka and panchayat sarpanch Panchanan Behera went ahead with it with the help of block officials.        
	Pending warrants        
	Nearly 1,370 people in Jagatsinghpur district, including political leaders, youth leaders, sarpanch and panchayat samiti members, would be disqualified for exercising their franchise in the general elections.         
	Sources in the district election office said they were ineligible to cast their votes, as warrant cases are pending against them for six months or more.         
	The Jagatsinghpur district police had drawn up the list of the accused against whom warrant cases are pending for six months or more.

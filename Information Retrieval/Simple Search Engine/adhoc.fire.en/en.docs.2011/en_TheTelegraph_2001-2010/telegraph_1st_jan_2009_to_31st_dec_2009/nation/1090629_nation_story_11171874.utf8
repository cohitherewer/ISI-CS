The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rebel-held road cleared
                                                                                                               Rebel-held road cleared
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 28: The home ministry today said the 22km-stretch between Orissas Koraput and Narayanpatna blocked by a tribal group with suspected Maoist links had been cleared and road connectivity restored.        
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik is believed to have ordered firm action by state and central forces after P. Chidambaram last week stressed the need to clear the roads to re-establish control.        
	The stretch had been blocked by the Chasi Muliya Adivasi Sangha, initially thought to be a tribal group but suspected to be backed by the CPI (Maoist) since nine security personnel clearing the roads were killed in a landmine explosion on June 18.        
	The clear-up initiative was undertaken by a team of commandos from the special operations group of the state police and a CRPF company, who used tree-cutting equipment and heavy earthmovers. They were accompanied by a bomb disposal squad and sniffer dogs.        
	The Narayanpatna area had been partially cut off from June 15 and fully from June 17. Almost 170 trees were removed from the roads and two trenches filled up.        
	Home ministry sources said that unlike in Bengals Lalgarh, no improvised explosive devices were found in Narayanpatna nor was there resistance from the Maoists.        
	Some suggested a message for the Bengal government in the rapid clear-up action.

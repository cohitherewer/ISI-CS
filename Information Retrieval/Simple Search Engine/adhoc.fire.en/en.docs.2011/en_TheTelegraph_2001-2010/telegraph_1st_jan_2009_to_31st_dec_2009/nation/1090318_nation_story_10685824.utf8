  - Extra vigil on red dens        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Bhubaneswar, March 17: The state government has urged the Centre to depute at least 70 companies of central paramilitary forces to ensure free and fair elections in communally volatile and Maoist-affected areas.        
	Sources said home secretary A.P. Padhi had made this request to the Union home ministry yesterday, stating that 30 companies of central forces would not be adequate to conduct simultaneous Lok Sabha and Assembly polls in the state, slated on April 16 and 23.         
	Pleading for more forces, the government apparently cited the compelling circumstances that warrant such deployment.         
	First, simultaneous polls are being held for 21 Lok Sabha and 147 Assembly constituencies. Second, its not possible to shift 20 companies of the forces deployed in communally sensitive Kandhamal district.        
	Earlier, the minority communities had apprehended communal tension in Kandhamal and other areas during the polls and had urged the Centre to extend deployment of central paramilitary forces till the end of elections. The last reason cited by the government for deployment of more forces was the possibility of increased Maoist disturbance in view of their call to boycott the polls. The Maoist menace has spread to more areas, as compared to 2004 polls, the sources argued.        
	During the 2004 Lok Sabha and Assembly polls, the Centre had deputed 35 companies of CRPF. But this time, the home ministry has agreed to deploy 30 companies of central paramilitary forces, including 20 companies now deployed in Kandhamal district.        
	Meanwhile, state chief electoral officer Alaka Panda reviewed the requirement of law and order arrangements for the conduct of polls and discussed the matters with the director-general of police and other top police officers.         
	Some of the collectors of Maoist-affected districts have sought deployment of helicopters for surveillance as well as transport of polling personnel and materials, in case of necessity.         
	We have also conveyed the requirements to the Election Commission as well as the home ministry, said a senior official in the chief electoral officers office.

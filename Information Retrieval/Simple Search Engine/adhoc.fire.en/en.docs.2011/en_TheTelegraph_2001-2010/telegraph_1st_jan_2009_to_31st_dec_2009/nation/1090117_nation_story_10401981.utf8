                                                                                                               Indian sailors missing
                            
	New Delhi, Jan. 16 (PTI): A fishing vessel with three Indians on board has been hijacked by pirates off the coast of Kenya.         
	The Kenyan vessel, MV Alpha Manyara  hijacked on January 9  has an Indian captain and an engineer, besides another Indian crewmember, according to relatives of the sailors taken hostage.         
	They have been identified as Palaswamy Sarvanan from Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, Sebastian Antony from Keralas Kottayam district and Thresia Fernando from Dindigul in Tamil Nadu.        
	Sebastian has been working as a plant engineer with Kenyas Alfa Group, which owns the vessel, for the last nine years, said family friend Benoji. His wife Tessy and two daughters are now at Changanassery in Kottayam.         
	Sarvanan, an engineer who works with the Kenya-based General Engineering Company, was on the ship for repair work when the pirates attacked it, his wife Shiva, a mother of two, said.        
	Indian Navy chief Sureesh Mehta said in Delhi the incident, took place well outside the (Arabian) gulf.         
	Mehta said Indian ships deployed in the Gulf of Aden to fight Somali pirates did not patrol the Kenyan coast. But the navy will take whatever action is required to see that they get released, he added.        
	I am not aware if there were any Kenyans on board but according to the reports, ...there may be some other fishermen, Mehta added.         
	George, the brother of Sarvanan who had moved from Tiruchirapalli in Tamil Nadu to Visakhapatnam about 20 years ago, said the pirates had released eight Kenyan sailors.        
	We were informed about the incident a day after the vessel was hijacked. Since then we have not heard from the company or the government. The company has declined to pay any ransom, George said.        
	According to Sebastians relatives, the pirates have demanded a huge ransom.

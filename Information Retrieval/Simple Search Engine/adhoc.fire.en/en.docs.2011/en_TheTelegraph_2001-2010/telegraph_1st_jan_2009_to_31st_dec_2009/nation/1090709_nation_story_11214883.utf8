          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              Sania Mirza, (top) Mohammed Ashraf, who barged into her home				                                 
	Hyderabad, July 8: A certain Sohrab has won over Sania game, set and match but suitors of the tennis glam girl continue to torment her ahead of her engagement on Friday.        
	A young software engineer working in Bangalore was arrested late last night from the players residence here after he barged in and demanded that Sania Mirzas parents cancel the engagement.        
	Instead, 28-year-old Mohammed Ashraf insisted, Sanias parents should get their daughter to marry him since he was in love with her.         
	Ashraf, who is six years older than Sania, went to her Banjara Hills home around 11.30 last night and picked an argument with her father, Imran Mirza, urging him to call off the engagement.         
	Ashraf, who was accompanied by friend Devadish Mohanty, claimed he had got to know Sania during her visits to Bangalore over the months and that they had exchanged emails and text messages.        
	The tennis stars father lodged a complaint of harassment against the two men, who were arrested late last night.         
	Ashraf has been making threatening calls to my daughter on her mobile number, police officials quoted the senior Mirza as stating in his complaint.         
	Ashraf and Mohanty were booked on charges of harassment and creating nuisance and produced in the citys civil court. They have been sent to jail for seven days, by which time Sania would be officially engaged.        
	Sania, who lost in the second round at Wimbledon, is said to have gone with her family on a shopping tour to Mumbai and Bangalore last weekend.         
	The Mirzas refused to speak on the arrest of the belligerent suitor or his claim that Sania had exchanged mails and text messages with him. They sought to shrug off the controversy and called on the family of the groom-to-be at their house in the Anandpur area of the city. Sanias fianc Sohrab Mirza is a businessman.         
	We have changed our mobile numbers, was all the senior Mirza said.         
	The families are not keen to discuss irritants ahead of Fridays engagement for which brisk arrangements are under way.        
	The Mirzas are keeping the venue a secret in view of Tuesdays trouble, though the ballroom of the Taj Krishna hotel is believed to be gearing up to host the event.         
	Florists from Zam Bagh are expected to decorate the venue, while Karachi bakeries and Universal bakeries are providing the sweets and dry fruits. Two popular cooks of Mughlai dishes in government service are said to have been hired to rustle up the biryanis, chicken and mutton dishes, cooked in dum pukht style.         
	The guest list includes Hyderabads rich and mighty, from Ahmad Allam Khan of the royal family to top bureaucrats, sportsmen like badminton ace P. Gopichand and former cricketer-turned-MP Mohammed Azharuddin as well as film stars Chiranjeevi and Nagarjuna.        
	Both families have opted for a small engagement party and have pruned the guest list to around 500. Some special guests expected from Bangalore and Delhi have been accommodated in guesthouses to avoid media attention. The event is expected to last over five hours in the evening and will include traditional betrothal rituals.

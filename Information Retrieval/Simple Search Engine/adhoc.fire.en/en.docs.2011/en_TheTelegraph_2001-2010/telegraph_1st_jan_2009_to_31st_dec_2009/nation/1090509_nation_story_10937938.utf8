The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Scramble to revive UPA
                                                                                                               Scramble to revive UPA
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN      
	New Delhi, May 8: The Congress is rushing to revive the UPA coalition to prevent constitutional ambivalence on who should be invited first to stake claim to form the government after May 16: the single largest party or the single largest pre-poll alliance.        
	The conundrum will have to be resolved in a scenario in which the Congress could emerge as the single largest party but with fewer numbers than the BJP-led NDA which is fighting the elections as a pre-poll formation.        
	There is a UPA and it stands firm on its own, Union minister Kapil Sibal said. He also included the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Lok Janshakti Party in the UPA, notwithstanding their estrangement with the Congress as a result of which the parties fought each other in Bihar and engaged in a vituperative campaign.        
	Sibal said on May 16, as the results came in, the Congress would arm itself with letters of support from all its UPA allies, including the RJD and the LJP as well as the Samajwadi Party.         
	The Samajwadi was not a part of the UPA but supported the Manmohan Singh government from outside after the Left pulled out in July last year over the nuclear deal. The single largest party includes the single largest pre-declared alliance and our allies include the Trinamul Congress, the NCP and the DMK, said Abhishek Singhvi, a Congress spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP.        
	While Sibal refused to answer questions on who the President would invite, Singhvi said: There is no rule about it, no constitutional provision. The President will get a feel of it and perhaps convince herself about aspects such as stability.        
	As the BJP has drummed up a campaign over how the UPA had ceased to exist after Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan left, Sibal argued that while they may have fought separately in Bihar, both leaders had reiterated they were part of the UPA at the Centre and would remain so after the elections.        
	As the reality of putting together a coalition hit home, Congress strategists tried to mollify UPA constituents cut up with Rahul Gandhis reaching out to the Janata Dal (United) and the Telugu Desam. M. Veerappa Moily, the partys chief spokesperson, said Rahuls praise of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar should not be used to fuel his ego.         
	As speculation swirled over how Lalu Prasad and Paswan did not attend a cabinet meeting today to show their pique at Rahul, Sibal said two other RJD ministers were deputed in Lalu Prasads place.

	Bhubaneswar, May 6: The government health machinery has geared up to monitor swine flu and prevent contamination of the killer virus.        
	No case of swine flu or human influenza (H1N1) has been detected in the state. But, we dont want to take chances and have taken all precautionary measures according to a central government advisory, said a senior official of the state health department.        
	Residents are being advised to wash hands using alcohol/soaps and use tissue paper/hanky while sneezing to prevent contamination from humans and avoid eating pig meat. Chief district medical officers have been asked to keep a check on primary and community health centres and provide case management facilities at the district headquarter hospitals.

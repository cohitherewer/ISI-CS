	Hyderabad, Jan. 6 (PTI): An HSBC call centre employee who allegedly withdrew Rs 47 lakh, including some in Calcutta, from a Greek customers account has been arrested.        
	Rahul Kumar, working for the banks call centre in Visakhapatnams Siripuram for the past year and a half, talked Eva Pagony into parting with her account details and ATM PIN when she dialled the centre last September to get a technical problem solved, police said.        
	Rahul opened an account and started withdrawing money illegally from Pagonys account, K. Ananda Reddy, sub-inspector of the task force that arrested him, said today.        
	Rahul withdrew Rs 10 lakh two times and Rs 12 lakh twice and another Rs 3 lakh in Calcutta. With the sum he purchased a vehicle, cleared his credit card debts and even invested the remaining amount, Reddy said.         
	He didnt explain the Calcutta link in Rahuls withdrawals.        
	Rahul, picked up on January 4 following a complaint from an official of HSBCs risk and fraud control unit, is said to have confessed and revealed that he took help from four persons in making the withdrawals.         
	A Visakhapatnam court has remanded him in 14 days judicial custody.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Jaswant book ban heat on Gujarat govt
                                                                                                               Jaswant book ban heat on Gujarat govt
          OUR BUREAU                          Jaswant: Not my fault                                  
	Ahmedabad/New Delhi, Sept. 1: Legal heat is mounting on the Gujarat government over its hasty ban on expelled BJP leader Jaswant Singhs book on Jinnah.        
	Gujarat High Court, which is hearing a PIL against the ban, today reserved its judgment until tomorrow on the validity of the notification issued on August 19, two days after the launch of the book, Jinnah: India-Partition Independence.        
	The Narendra Modi government had filed an affidavit in court seeking time and permission to issue a fresh notification detailing the reasons for its decision.         
	The state will also have to give reasons to the Supreme Court that took up Jaswants petition against the ban today. The apex court, though, refused to stay the notification without hearing the state.         
	The Gujarat notification of August 19 had cited a threat to public order because the book questioned the role of Sardar Patel during Partition and his patriotic spirit.        
	Anand Yagnik, counsel for the petitioners, argued that permitting the government more time amounted to allowing the illegal ban.        
	The bench agreed with the contention. We are considering validity of the present notification on merit and the judgment is reserved, Chief Justice K.S. Radhakrishan, speaking for the three-member special bench, said.         
	Prakash Shah, who had filed the petition along with fellow civil rights activist Manishi Jani, said the government, by looking to file a fresh notification, had yielded ground.         
	Now it is obvious that the government has conceded moral defeat. By wanting to issue a fresh notification to justify its illegal ban, it has admitted that the notification of August 19 is defective, he said.         
	Yagnik, his counsel, argued that the notification was illegal as it did not satisfy the requirement of law  it should give reasons and grounds for forming an opinion as laid down in three Supreme Court judgments.        
	The legal battle looks set to continue with the Supreme Court seeking an explanation from the government on the reasons for the ban. The matter has been listed for September 8.        
	We cannot pass an ex parte (with one party absent) order. It would not be proper, the two-member bench said. Once an arrow leaves a bow, we cant take it back, Justice Altamas Kabir said.         
	Fali Nariman, appearing for Jaswant, contended that the ban violated his clients fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.         
	The Gujarat notification is not a bona fide attempt to ban the book, Nariman argued.                           
	He also drew the courts attention to the circumstances leading up to the ban.         
	The ban notification came two days after the book was released, he pointed out, hinting that the state could not have applied its mind to the subject within such a short span of time.         
	Publishers Rupa, who are also opposing the ban, offered copies of the book to the bench to read before they decided on the matter.         
	Though initially hesitant it would prejudice them, the bench sought two copies of the book for itself to read.         
	Speaking to reporters outside court, Jaswant echoed the view that the ban had been imposed without applying any mind. The state government did not even read the book, forget hearing me, he said. I have come here for justice.         
	Jaswant scoffed at a suggestion on whether he would ever consider going back to the BJP. The BJP is my former party. That door is closed. I do not intend to go that side again, he said crisply.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Maya sits pretty, but for the X factor
                                                                                                               Maya sits pretty, but for the X factor

	Pilibhit, March 31: Mofussil offices of the Bahujan Samaj Party are no longer holes in nondescript quarters of town; theyve moved along with the partys rising-expanding fortunes to grander stations.         
	The one in Pilibhit is insistently emblematic of its new status as party of power  two spanking floors mid-town, presided by a spectral Mayavati cutout swaying in the wind.         
	And you cant miss the white whale of an SUV parked afront  when it rides Pilibhits criss-cross strips, it lets nothing edge past. And should you wish to believe its occupant, thatll remain the order of Pilibhit for a while: Ab aandhi-Gandhi kuchh nahin, jiska haathi usi ki lathi. (Theres no Gandhi and no storm, the BSPs elephant is the new norm.)         
	Hem Raj Verma, former MLA and current engine of the BSPs Lok Sabha campaign here, has seen Varun-inspired sectarian fervour roll this way and that all of last week from his office perch  recurrent deluges of saffron that have led many to believe Varun Gandhi is past the post even before filing his nomination papers.         
	Theyve left Verma quite unworried. All desperation, he says, flicking specks of mud off his patent leather Reeboks. This is Varuns family seat, mother has been five-term MP, please ask why did he have to make such speeches? He is not sure, and he is right to worry.         
	The BSP is locating Varuns worries in two factors. One, mother Maneka has not nursed Pilibhit nearly enough  it is remote and bereft, and bears greater resemblance to the backwardness of Nepal to the north than to the upward mobility of Bareilly next door. When the road up turns rutted and ravaged, locals say, you should know Pilibhit is close; evidence suggests locals are not guilty of exaggeration. So Varun may have a lot to answer for on his predecessors record.         
	Two, and more critically, delimitation visited Pilibhit and left the seat gerrymandered in a fashion that frightened Maneka and son.         
	Close to one lakh Muslim votes were added and nearly 50,000 Hindu-Sikh votes went out. Suddenly, nobody with a BJP ticket could feel comfortable unless there was a pre-poll consolidation of non-Muslim votes. Therefore, the BSPs Verma concludes, the frenzied hate-mongering by Varun. And, therefore, he goes on, the BSPs sense of comfort.         
	It is not as if all Hindu votes are going to go to Varun, no matter how much anti-Muslim and anti-Sikh nonsense he talks, Verma says, securely. Our candidate (Buddhasein Verma) is a Lodh and there are close to two lakh Lodhs here to add to an equal number of Dalits. And there are the Muslims, of course, so where is the worry for us?         
	But before he can pronounce the QEDs on his analysis, the X factors in the equation need examination. The biggest X in Pilibhit is not the Hindu vote, apparently consolidating behind Varun every day he spends in jail; the biggest X is the vote that he has rudely forsaken  the constituencys 4.2 lakh Muslims.         
	Chief minister Mayavati may be in dogged pursuit of that huge kitty  even invoking the National Security Act against Varun to emphasise her credentials to the minorities as saviour and protector  but it is unlikely she will get sole possession.         
	There are, after all, many more claimants to the vote Varun will not get  there is the battle-scarred Pilibhit veteran V.M. Singh of the Congress. But more than him, there is Riaz Ahmed of the Samajwadi Party, who, many allege, is a Trojan horse from Manekas stables.         
	A local Sanjay Gandhi acolyte, Riaz was for long years a member of Manekas Sanjay Vichar Manch and once contested the Pilibhit seat on that ticket unsuccessfully.         
	Add to his son-of-the-soil status the institutional support of the Samajwadi Party, and Riaz becomes nobody you can keep out of the equation, especially when it comes to the Muslim vote.         
	Apne aadmi hain, local aadmi hain, says Riyasat Khan, a successful caterer from Paunta in the Pilibhit hinterland. Aise samay par apne log hi kaam aayenge. (He is our own man, a local man, at times like these, such people will come handy.)         
	Riaz, as is clear from the early sights and sounds of this campaign, is also well funded and loudly profiled across the constituency. His chief slogan  Riaz aandhi nahin toofaan hai, Pilibhit ki shaan hai  is a verbal riposte to Varuns campaign, but the ones he should cause worry are the BSP; a big enough breach in the Muslim vote and Varun could just be afforded enough room to sneak past the haathi.

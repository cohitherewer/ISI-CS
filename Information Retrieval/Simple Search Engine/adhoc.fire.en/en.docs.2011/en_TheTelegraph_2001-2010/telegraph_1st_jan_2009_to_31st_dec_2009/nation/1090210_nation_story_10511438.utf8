          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                     
	New Delhi, Feb.9: Rashtrapati Bhavan is considering a proposal to let the President call on Bhimsen Joshi to confer the Bharat Ratna on the Hindustani music maestro.        
	The programme may be held at Joshis residence in Pune because of his poor health. It is being considered if an exception can be made as Panditji is unwell. It will be thought of, a Rashtrapati Bhavan source said.         
	If President Pratibha Patil does call on the 87-year-old Joshi, it will be the first departure from the convention of holding the award ceremony at Rashtrapati Bhavan.

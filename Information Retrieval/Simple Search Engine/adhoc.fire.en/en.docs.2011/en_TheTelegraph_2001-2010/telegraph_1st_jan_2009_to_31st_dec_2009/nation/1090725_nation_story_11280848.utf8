The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Plan to free top colleges 
                                                                                                               Plan to free top colleges 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, July 24: Education minister Kapil Sibal has hinted he supports de-affiliating top colleges from overburdened universities, a proposal made by the Yash Pal panel on higher education that could alter Indias university structure.        
	The Centre is considering allowing top colleges to function autonomously of any university, Sibal today told principal secretaries and higher education secretaries of the states at an annual meeting today.        
	The proposal, if implemented, could eventually lead to top colleges offering their own degrees  a St Stephens college degree or a Presidency College degree, for instance.        
	The idea of allowing autonomy to some of the countrys best colleges has been articulated by academics and even by the National Knowledge Commission. It has been discussed in the UGC too, but the government has till now not shown any inclination to implement the proposal.        
	The Yash Pal report has, however, provided a fresh trigger for the debate on the proposal and Sibal, unlike his predecessor Arjun Singh, is seriously studying its feasibility, sources said.        
	In India, higher education degrees, across streams, can be awarded only by universities, deemed-to-be universities and institutes of national importance (INIs) set up by Parliament  like the IITs and the National Institutes of Technology.        
	Every registered society that wants to run a college, private or public, needs to affiliate that college to a university for its students to receive recognised degrees. Deemed universities and INIs are not allowed, under the law, to affiliate colleges.        
	Under the current model, some universities have too many undergraduate colleges that are often hard to manage centrally, critics have argued. Delhi University, for instance, has over 80 such colleges.        
	The Yash Pal panel too articulated these concerns.         
	The autonomous colleges would be in a position to pursue their own academic practices but unlike a university, would not be able to affiliate colleges. Once these colleges improve their standards even further, they may be allowed to become full-fledged universities, the panel said.

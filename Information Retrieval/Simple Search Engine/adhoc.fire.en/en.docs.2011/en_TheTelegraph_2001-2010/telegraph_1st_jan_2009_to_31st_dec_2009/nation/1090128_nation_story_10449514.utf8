                                                                                                               Pub attack arrests as BJP fights fire     CM denies Sena link with Sangh
                              Ram Sena activists assault a man outside the Mangalore pub on Saturday. (PTI)                                  
	Belgaum/Mangalore, Jan. 27 (PTI): Police picked up Ram Sena chief Pramod Mutalik and dozens of activists for Saturdays assault in a Mangalore pub even as the BJP-led state government claimed the outfit had no link with the Sangh parivar.        
	Karnataka chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa said the Ram Sena had nothing to do with the parivar. I am telling you honestly, he said while condemning the incident.          
	Mutaliks arrest, amid growing public outrage against the assault on women at the pub, came soon after the former Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader addressed a news conference in Belgaum to apologise for the attack. I apologise. The action taken by our activists is wrong, Mutalik said.        
	Activists of his right-wing outfit had barged into the pub on Saturday night and assaulted youngsters  women and men  after accusing them of behaving in an obscene manner.         
	Mutalik, however, said in a television interview before his arrest that dancing in the nude and taking drugs was wrong. Our action was aimed at protecting the women, he claimed.        
	Asked if his government would ban the outfit, Yeddyurappa was non-committal. We will see whether we should ban (the group) or not. It will take its own time. We will discuss the issue with police officers, the chief minister said.        
	But he made it clear that obscene dance would not be allowed at nightclubs in the state.        
	The Opposition Janata Dal (Secular) has demanded that Yeddyurappa or home minister V.S. Acharya resign for their failure to check such incidents.        
	Former chief minister and Dal(S) Karnataka state president H.D. Kumaraswamy accused BJP outfits in the state of taking law into their own hands.        
	In Bangalore, BJP president Rajnath Singh said it was unfortunate that our political opponents and the so-called secularists suffer from an RSS-BJP phobia. They tend to level allegations without even verifying the facts.        
	The BJP condemns this incident in totality, he added.        
	Belgaum police chief Sonia Narang said Mutalik had been arrested under the Indian Penal Codes Section 153 for provocation with intent to cause riots.        
	Outfit vice-president Prasad Attavar was picked up, too, taking the number of those detained for the assault to 32.         
	But Mutalik made it clear his outfit would not be deterred by the police action. We are going to protest against those celebrating Valentines Day, he said.         
	We condemn the pub culture. In our culture, we respect and salute women and give them status of mother.        
	He shrugged off the assault as a chhoti si ghatna  or small incident  and accused the media of blowing it out of proportion.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | For CPM, flak to flowers
                                                                                                               For CPM, flak to flowers

	Jogeshganj, June 13: The post-Aila brickbats turned magically into flowers for Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today as he visited a cyclone-hit CPM stronghold.        
	Unlike Gosaba and Hingalganj where the Bengal chief minister faced protests and accusations, he was garlanded and showered with petals as he stepped off the launch in Jogeshganj, a North 24-Parganas village.        
	The time and effort spent preparing the welcome betrayed how determined the CPM was that governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi would not be the only one to receive a petal-strewn greeting from cyclone victims.        
	Young party cadres waved placards reading: We welcome our respected chief minister. The festive air at the jetty looked at odds with the signs of devastation all around.        
	Later, at a meeting under a shamiana in front of a school, women came up to the dais and told Bhattacharjee of their woes. There was no hostility in their voice, no accusatory tone, as they told him relief was meagre and none had reached the interiors. A crowd of 1,000 waved the party flag.        
	On Bhattacharjees way to the school, homeless people living under tarpaulin sheets had thrown flowers at his convoy, leaving many wondering where they had got the flowers from. The days arrangements, however, had begun early.        
	About 90 minutes before the chief ministers arrival, gram panchayat pradhan Murari Mondal was supervising the erection of an arch of hay, decorated with flowers, on the road to the jetty. Women party workers piled garlands and petals on a brass plate.        
	The chief minister deserves such a welcome; he has done such good work, CPM gram panchayat member Anjana Biswas, who held a bunch of incense sticks, said.        
	Bhattacharjees advance security team almost spoiled the party, asking everyone to clear off because the route had to be sanitised. One call from Mondal on his cellphone to local MLA Gopal Gayen, whom he asked to speak to higher-ups, took care of the matter.        
	Gayen was the man smeared with mud on June 2 during Bhattacharjees trip to Hingalganj, which is in the same block as Jogeshganj.         
	The shadow of partisanship has loomed over the post-Aila developments amid allegations that Trinamul supporters among the relief camp inmates had been the most vocal against Bhattacharjee at Gosaba and Hingalganj. And that Trinamul had organised the governors welcome in Dhamakhali.        
	By joining the flower-shower competition, the CPM risks being accused of borrowing from its rivals arsenal to do politics over a human tragedy, and giving the impression of being on the defensive.        
	When Bhattacharjee arrived at 12.10pm, Anjana, CPM zilla parishad member Kalpana Mandal and party worker Rekha Pramanik touched his feet and garlanded him. Party supporters crowding the embankments chorused namaskars.        
	The chief minister promised that all their problems would be solved since I have brought my officers. He jumped into an auto, the fastest mode of transport in the village, and sped off to the rally at the school. On his way back to the jetty, more flowers.

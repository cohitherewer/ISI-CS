          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 24: Calcutta High Court today directed the Bengal government to vacate by December 31 all educational institutions in West Midnapore, including Lalgarh, occupied by joint forces fighting Maoists since June.        
	Chief Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya and Justice Prasenjit Mondal brushed aside the states argument that the situation was so grave that contractors werent willing to build camps, saying the conditions could not be worse than in Kargil (in 1999).        
	Is the situation in jangalmahal (the area around Lalgarh) worse than in Kargil? Bhattacharya asked, after advocate-general Balai Ray described the situation as very grave.        
	The judges initially gave only a week to have the schools vacated but Ray said it would be very difficult to accomplish the task in that time.        
	Ray explained that the Kargil operation was conducted by the army, which had its own engineers and workers to build camps. (But) the police (in West Midnapore) have no such engineers and workers. The state government has to depend on contractors for constructing camps.        
	He suggested that education had to take second place in some cases. Primarily, we are trying to save the lives of the common people of jangalmahal. Protection of life should get priority over education.         
	But Bhattacharya disagreed, saying the government cannot stop education for that. The judges said the government would have to take positive steps to make arrangements by December 31.         
	The state government was also asked to pay the electricity bills for the period that the forces occupied the schools, and start supplying mid-day meals to the students once the institutions reopened.        
	Todays order came on a petition filed last week by an NGO, Paschim Midnapore Bumijo Kalyan Samity, which said hundreds of students were being denied education because schools were occupied by the troops.        
	Late this evening, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said the government would comply with the order despite problems. We are not adequately prepared to make alternative accommodation for the joint forces right now. But we have to comply with the order and we will do it by December 31.         
	The joint forces have occupied 22 institutions across the rebel-hit parts of the district since June 18 when the troops began the operation.         
	Around a dozen schools are still being occupied by the forces.        
	In Midnapore, teachers and students were relieved. A teacher-in-charge of the Gohomidanga High School, Nimai Patra, said: After the forces occupied our school... we started teaching in tents set up by the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities (the Maoist-backed group leading the Lalgarh movement). But that is no longer possible as we have to conduct selection tests for Madhyamik. If the forces dont move out, we will have to conduct the tests sitting on the road.

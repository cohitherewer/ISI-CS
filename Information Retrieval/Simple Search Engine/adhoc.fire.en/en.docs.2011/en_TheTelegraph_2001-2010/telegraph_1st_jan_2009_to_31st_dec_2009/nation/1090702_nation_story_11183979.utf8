The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | UN survey pat for state
                                                                                                               UN survey pat for state
                            
	New Delhi, July 1 (PTI): Mineral-rich Orissa is fast moving up in the chart of investment-friendly destinations in the country, as domestic and global demands for natural resources is rising rapidly, stated a United Nations body in its survey recently.        
	Radical improvements in fiscal and budgetary positions and adoption of progressive and business-friendly legislation have transformed Orissas image into an investment destination of choice, states the investors survey conducted by the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (Unido).        
	There has been a boom in investment in the state over the past five years, led by its mining and metal sectors and stimulated by rapidly rising domestic and global demands for minerals and metals, the survey states.        
	It reveals that investors respond positively to the single-window mechanism introduced by the state government under the Orissa Industries (Facilitation) Act-2004. Some half of the investors have been using this route since 2005 rather than going through individual departments, as was the practise in the past... The average time reported to clear all customs has been reduced from 15 to just nine days, it points out.        
	The state has now achieved the countrys national average in terms of the time spent by the management in dealing with regulations and government authorities.         
	In comparison to the 2005 responses, respondents to the 2008 survey reported power outages occurring for shorter periods of time in Orissa, lesser than the average reported in business friendly states such as Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra.        
	Radical improvements in the states fiscal and budgetary position, as well as the adoption of progressive business-friendly legislation has transformed the states reputation as an investment destination of choice, UNIDO said.        
	However, the survey says, there is now a need to focus on investment promotion and facilitation activities to increase the diversity of investment at the SME level and to support linkages to the larger industrial projects under implementation in the state.        
	The Unido survey covered 289 companies, 30 per cent of which were in steel and mines, and 19 of the projects involved foreign investors.

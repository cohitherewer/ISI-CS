	 Bangalore, July 2: Three persons were killed today in clashes triggered by the alleged desecration of an under-construction mosque in the southern Karnataka town of Mysore.          One of the victims was a teenager and there were allegations he had died when police fired to control the warring groups. The police in the BJP-ruled state denied the charges saying the boy, identified as Junaid, 14, had been stabbed. However, faced with protests, they promised to get a final opinion from a panel of three doctors.           
	The trouble began when the mosques caretaker found a pigs carcass, Mysore police chief Sunil Agarwal said. As the word spread, groups armed with stones, soda bottles and swords fought on the streets, forcing the police to use batons and fire in the air.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Call to Modi to wake up: Mallya 
                                                                                                               Call to Modi to wake up: Mallya 
          OUR BUREAU                          Mallya, Modi: Prohibition poser                                  
	Bangalore/Ahmedabad, July 11: Liquor baron Vijay Mallya today called on the Gujarat government to give its people the freedom of choice over drinking alcohol.         
	The death of over 100 people resulting from the consumption of spurious alcohol is not only tragic but should serve as a wake-up call to our political hypocrites. (Gujarat chief minister) Narendra Modi knows fully well that every brand of alcohol is available in Gujarat at two or three times the price charged in neighbouring states, Mallya, the chairman of United Breweries, said in a statement released in Bangalore this morning.         
	The industrialists statement comes in the aftermath of the death of over 109 people from consuming adulterated hooch in Ahmedabad.         
	Mallya said the government had been unable to control the rampant smuggling of alcohol from neighbouring states and Union territories into Gujarat, which also meant a potential loss of revenue of thousands of crores for the exchequer.         
	The farce of prohibition which cannot be enforced leads to illegal, unhygienic and unsupervised production of deadly cocktails which claim innocent lives. It is about time the political masters face reality in the interests of peoples health whilst allowing them freedom of choice, Mallya said.         
	He said the UB Group was ready to work with the state government to introduce a responsible beverages consumption policy with appropriate warnings and restraints.         
	Blanket prohibition has never worked in this free world, he said.        
	Prakash Mirpuri, vice-president (corporate communications) of the UB Group, said Mallya felt it was important to share his views as chairman of Indias largest liquor company. Our whole endeavour is that if the government was liberal you wouldnt see these things.         
	The Gujarat government lashed back at Mallya, saying he had vested interests.        
	Home minister Amit Shah said: He (Mallya) should keep his mouth shut; he has no business to preach to us as we understand what is good for us and we dont need his uncalled for suggestion.         
	Mallya is a businessman. So he has vested interests to speak against the prohibition policy, Shah said.         
	The minister said Mallyas argument was fundamentally wrong because deaths from drinking spurious liquor have occurred in non-prohibition states as well.         
	The hooch tragedy in Ahmedabad has nothing to do with prohibition. Spurious liquor-related deaths have been reported elsewhere where there is no prohibition, Shah said.

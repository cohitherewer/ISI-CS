The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | On degree 89, out of toothpaste
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      On degree 89, out of toothpaste
          AMIT ROY                                    (Top) The six women ski towards the South Pole. Reena Kaushal Dharmshaktu (above) and her team members are less than 20 nautical miles from their destination. They have covered 900km, skiing from the edge of Antarctica                                  
	London, Dec. 28: Students of geography will understand what Reena Kaushal Dharmshaktu means when she says that we are on the last degree  the 89th degree on her all-women journey of a lifetime to the South Pole.        
	Barring last-minute accidents she and the other five members are now only a day or so away from journeys end  the geographic South Pole (the axis on which the planet spins and not to be confused with the magnetic South Pole).        
	It comes after a gruelling skiing expedition that will have taken them 900km through blizzards, temperatures as low as -40C, around potentially lethal crevasses hundreds of metres deep and the sheer exhaustion of pulling their pulks up hill.        
	Reena, who hopes to be the first Indian woman to get to the South Pole, said yesterday in a message relayed via satellite phone: Were all very excited and very happy that everyday we are getting closer and closer to the Pole. We are looking for any signs of the polar station, the American base, the Amundsen-Scott station, at the South Pole. But we havent seen any signs yet, no flags, no snow mobile trails or anything but Im pretty sure that tomorrow or the day after we will be coming into some of those. Hopefully! That will mean we are closer to our goal.        
	Unlike others who cheat by flying in for the last bit, Reena and her group, who are marking the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Commonwealth, have skied 900km from the edge of Antarctica.        
	Now that we are in the last degree we expect to see more and more of other groups and other groups trails, added Reena, a trifle sardonically. What happens is most of the people just fly into the last degree and they ski the last degree to the South Pole, not (skiing) all the way like weve been doing from the coast.        
	Unlike Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, whose team members had to eat their dogs (and feed the dogs to the dogs) when he led the first successful expedition to the South Pole in 1912, todays girls had curry on Christmas Day.        
	British team leader Felicity Aston reported in her December 25 despatch: We covered 15.6 nautical miles which is a really good day for us and then this evening, we put the tents up and got together in one of the tents to have a Christmas meal of freeze dried chicken tikka masala.        
	Today  Day 36 since the girls started skiing  Felicity sent an update. We are now less than 20 nautical miles from the geographic South Pole which is very exciting. It brings new meaning to the phrase so close, and yet so far.        
	She went on: We thought we might be able to see the South Pole station. Its an American research station situated at the South Pole and we thought we might be able to see out on the horizon today but we havent been able to see anything yet which is very frustrating. Really desperate to see something.        
	The girls have missed everyday creature comforts, Felicity confessed. Our minds have certainly been wandering towards thinking about the end of our expedition and what were going to do first and I think high on everyones list is going for a shower, a nice hot shower but we have to wait until we get back to Chile for that.         
	None of us has even seen a shower since November 12 .... Weve also got a small toothbrush each and some toothpaste but worryingly were running very low on toothpaste  if we were at home we probably would have thrown the tube away by now. None of us will ever take for granted hot running water or a flushing toilet ever again, thats for sure!

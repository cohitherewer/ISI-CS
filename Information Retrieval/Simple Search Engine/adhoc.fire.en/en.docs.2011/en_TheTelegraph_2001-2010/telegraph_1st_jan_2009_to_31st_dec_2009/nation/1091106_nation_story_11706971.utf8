          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 5: The Union government will use a combination of bridge courses and open schooling to legalise diplomas of thousands of Bengal teacher trainees held illegal by Calcutta High Court, human resource development minister Kapil Sibal promised today.        
	But the HRD minister lashed out at the state government for once again advertising for teachers with qualifications below the standards set by the Centre  the grounds on which the high court declared the earlier diplomas illegal.         
	Sibal said the HRD ministry has written to the Bengal government, asking it to withdraw this advertisement.         
	This could lead to fresh litigation on the same or similar grounds as earlier. We are trying to help the teacher trainees on humanitarian grounds. But states must cooperate with us, Sibal said.         
	The law governing Indias apex teacher education regulator  the National Council for Teacher Education  states that diploma courses must be of two years duration.        
	The NCTE also has a minimum curriculum that diploma courses in teacher training must teach and qualifications that aspirants to these courses must fulfil.         
	These standards require aspirants to have cleared their Class XII qualifying examinations with a minimum of 50 per cent marks.         
	But Bengal was hiring primary schoolteachers who had simply cleared their Class X qualifying examinations. It was also allowing teacher-training institutes to offer one-year diplomas.         
	The high court verdict last year led to 122 primary teacher training institutes (PTTIs) being declared illegal, derecognising the diplomas of 31,141 students.         
	Under Sibals plan, those who meet the eligibility criteria  50 per cent or above in their Class XII qualifying examination  but studied one-year diplomas declared illegal by the court, can sit for one-year bridge courses.         
	On clearing the bridge course, the trainees will be eligible as teachers in government schools.        
	As reported by The Telegraph on September 4, the bridge course plan  likely to be implemented starting later this month  is expected to benefit 16,759 of the students whose careers are currently in limbo.        
	Teacher trainees who have cleared Class XII qualifying examinations but with scores below 50 per cent will be allowed to re-appear for the qualifying examinations through the National Institute of Open Schooling.

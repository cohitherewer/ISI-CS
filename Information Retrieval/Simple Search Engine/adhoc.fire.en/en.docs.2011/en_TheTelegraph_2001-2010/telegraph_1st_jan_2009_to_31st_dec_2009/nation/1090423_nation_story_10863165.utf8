The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cash FIR against Prakash Jha
                                                                                                               Cash FIR against Prakash Jha
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Jha: Harass bid?                                  
	Patna, April 22: Police today claimed to have seized Rs 10.25 lakh from filmmaker Prakash Jhas sugar factory office following allegations that he was distributing money among voters, but the LJP candidate said the late-night raid was to harass him.        
	Jha, who is contesting from the West Champaran Lok Sabha seat, said it was the design of Bihars ruling Janata Dal (United) to humiliate him ahead of polls tomorrow.        
	An FIR was registered against Jha, district police chief K.S. Anupam, who led the raid, told PTI.        
	Officials said the raid on Jhas Maurya Sugar Factory office-cum-guest house followed a tip-off that he was distributing cash among voters after campaigning had ended yesterday. They said the raiding party seized Rs 10.25 lakh in cash and took into custody 38 persons who were later released. Jha was not in the office during the raid.        
	Raids were also carried out on the establishments of Congress nominee Sadhu Yadav and BJP candidate Sanjay Jaiswal, but neither was present during the searches.        
	Neither Prakash Jha nor (any of the) others was arrested, Anupam said, denying reports that the filmmaker had been taken into custody.        
	Tuhin Shankar, Jhas legal adviser, said the money was there for payment of wages to workers. The sugar factory office gets money from various sources and it has nothing to do with the polls.        
	Jha, known for making socio-political films like Gangaajal, said it was his election office that the police should have raided if at all they had sensed some foul play.        
	His party chief Ram Vilas Paswan attacked the Nitish Kumar government for using the official machinery to harass his partys nominee.        
	District magistrate Dilip Kumar said the administration had been working for the Election Commission, not the state government.        
	It was a routine raid carried out to ensure free and fair polls, he added.        
	Chiru fracas        
	In Tirupati, Congress workers allegedly barged into a hotel and tried to attack Praja Rajyam Party chief Chiranjeevi, accusing him of distributing money among voters through party activists.        
	The police searched the Tirupati candidates room but found nothing to suggest the actor-politician, who is contesting Assembly elections, had been giving money to voters.

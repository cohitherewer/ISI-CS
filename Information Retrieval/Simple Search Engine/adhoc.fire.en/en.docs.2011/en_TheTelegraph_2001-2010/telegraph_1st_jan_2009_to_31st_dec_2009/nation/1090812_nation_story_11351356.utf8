The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Beer good for women amp; no bones about it
                                                                                                               Beer good for women amp; no bones about it
  - For your health only          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           A woman fills beer at a bar                                        
	New Delhi, Aug. 11: Women who are habitual beer drinkers appear to have higher bone density, according to a new study that has generated fresh evidence for the beneficial effects of beer on the health of bones.         
	Spanish doctors who conducted ultrasound bone scans of a group of women found that quantitative bone density values were greater in beer drinkers than those who either did not drink beer or drank only wine.         
	The researchers led by Juan Pedrera-Zamorano at the University of Extremadura in Caceres, Spain, found significant differences in bone density between non-drinkers and drinkers of beer.         
	The results of the study appear today in the journal Nutrition.         
	But the researchers caution they are not recommending consumption of beer or wine or any other alcohol for bone health.         
	A number of studies have previously indicated that alcohol can improve bone mass and density in women. The work by Zamorano and his colleagues indicates that for bone health, beer is slightly better than wine.         
	A study by researchers at Tufts University in the US had earlier this year suggested that regular moderate consumption of beer or wine may have a protective effect on bone, but heavy liquor drinking may lead to bone loss.         
	The Tufts study had found that men who consumed more than two servings of liquor a day had significantly lower bone density than men who consumed only one or two servings a day, a news release from Tufts University had said.         
	The study, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, showed a greater association between high bone density and beer and wine than with liquor.         
	There is a body of research showing alcoholism is devastating to bones, lead researcher Katherine Tucker said in a statement issued through the university. Its a major risk factor for osteoporosis. No one should depend solely on alcohol to maintain bone health.         
	The Spanish researchers have said the benefit from beer might emerge from the combination of two compounds, daidzein and genistein, which belong to a family of phytoestrogens  a group of naturally-occurring non-steroidal plant compounds  that protect bones. Both these phytoestrogens were identified as ingredients in beer about a decade ago, they said.         
	Besides phytoestrogens, beer also contains a compound called orthosilicic acid, a potential source of silicon which also protects bones.

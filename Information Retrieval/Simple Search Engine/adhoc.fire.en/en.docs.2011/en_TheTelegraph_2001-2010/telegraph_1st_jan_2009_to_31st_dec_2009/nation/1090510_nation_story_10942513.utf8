            Many faces of Jadavpur: (From top) Hiland Park on EM Bypass; farmers at work in the Kashipur area in Bhangar; a newly laid road in the Shonepur area in Bhangar. Pictures by Sanat Kumar Sinha                                       
	An 84km road project that the government has for now put on ice may decide the battle of the two Ss, Sujan Chakraborty of the CPM and Kabir Suman of the Trinamul Congress.        
	The poll arithmetic is complex in Jadavpur constituency, carved out of the citys southern parts and its fringes, whose voters range from the sedan-riding residents of Hiland Park to the impoverished farmers of Bhangar, around 35km from Calcutta.        
	With the minorities making up 28 per cent of the constituencys 13.4 lakh-strong electorate, the Sachar Committee report and the lack of development find mention in almost all rallies in the rural areas. And, of course, land acquisition.        
	But around Hiland Park or South City, the CPMs main poll planks are Bengals loss from the exit of the Nano and the global economic downturn. The Trinamul leaders are harping on the Marxists sustained failure to create jobs and the need for change.        
	Yesterday, there was a Trinamul rally near my house. I heard them justifying their opposition to the Nano factory. Some of the leaders were even against the shopping malls. I cant vote for them, said Sudipta, a homemaker in her early 30s, as she left South City.        
	Such assertions of the urban viewpoint are good news for the ruling party, but both CPM and Trinamul leaders agree that the proposed Barasat-Raichak road will be the decisive factor.        
	I will vote for Kabir Suman because he has promised to save our land from acquisition for the project, whispered Jalaluddin Sarkar, who wants to cling on to his 10 cottahs in Bhangar, which borders Rajarhat. Rasta diye ki hobe (what purpose will the road serve)? he asked.        
	The Indonesia-based Salim Group was to build a highway from Barasat, the headquarters of North 24-Parganas, to Raichak in South 24-Parganas, the gateway to Haldia on the opposite bank of the Hooghly.        
	Billing it as the road to prosperity for South 24-Parganas, the government set the ball rolling for land acquisition. But a slew of protests in the backdrop of Nandigram and Singur forced it to put the project on hold.        
	We still think the road will boost the districts economy but we have decided not to do anything without the peoples mandate, CPM candidate Chakraborty said during a break from campaigning in Bhangar.         
	Other than Jadavpur, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Assembly segment, the parliamentary constituency includes Baruipur (East), Baruipur (West), Sonarpur (North), Sonarpur (South), Tollygunge and Bhangar.        
	People in the two Baruipurs and Bhangar would be hit the worst if land is taken over for the road project. We are sure we will get handsome leads from these Assembly segments because of the road factor, said Arabul Islam, Trinamul MLA from Bhangar, a traditional CPM stronghold. In the 2006 Assembly elections, Islam became the first Opposition MLA from Bhangar since 1977.        
	The defeat in Bhangar, where the minority population is around 80 per cent, is a big worry for the CPM. Last years panchayat polls, where disunity cost the party heavily, is another.        
	It is true that some of our supporters left us in the past few years, but many of them are coming back after realising the true colours of Trinamul leaders, said Chakraborty, a Jadavpur University graduate in pharmaceutical technology who won this Lok Sabha seat by around 90,000 votes in 2004.        
	He admits that many things have changed in the past five years. More than 50 per cent of the constituency has changed following delimitation, and the political equations have been transformed by the land acquisition debate.        
	Although the government has slammed the brakes on the road project, several areas in the constituency  such as parts of Bhangar, Baruipur and Sonarpur  have witnessed a steady rise in the number of land deals.        
	Businessmen have started buying plots along the proposed road and local political leaders are facilitating these deals, a source in the real estate industry confirmed.        
	The CPM and Trinamul are accusing each other of promoting these land deals and accepting commissions.        
	Trinamul believes its candidate will win with a lead of over 20,000 votes from Bhangar and around 10,000 from the two Baruipur segments. The CPM is banking on the Jadavpur Assembly seat, where it expects a lead of over 20,000 votes, and marginal gains in Tollygunge and the two Sonarpur segments.        
	The CPMs calculations are based on past trends. They have failed to realise that their support among minority voters has fallen sharply, said Trinamul leader Abu Taher as he waited for the party candidate in Surjyapaur.        
	Kabir Suman, wearing a blue T-shirt and a blue Armstrong band, arrived at the venue and headed straight for the dais amid huge applause.        
	I had never imagined I would contest an election. But the lawlessness in the state and the CPMs oppressive rule have forced me to fight this battle, he said.        
	Kabir Suman is happy at the huge turnouts at his rallies but doesnt know if it will translate into votes. For the singer-turned-Trinamul candidate, who calls himself a political person but not a politician, the peoples mistrust of CPM is his biggest strength.        
	He has been criss-crossing the constituency with Nandigram-Singur and some of his old chart-busters on his lips. But the apolitical candidate has been unable to match his rivals extensive campaigning.        
	The CPM is deriving hope from the Trinamul candidates political inexperience. Had they fielded a political candidate, the fight would have been tougher. According to our assessment, we will win with a slender margin, a senior district CPM leader said.              
	 Jadavpur votes on May 13

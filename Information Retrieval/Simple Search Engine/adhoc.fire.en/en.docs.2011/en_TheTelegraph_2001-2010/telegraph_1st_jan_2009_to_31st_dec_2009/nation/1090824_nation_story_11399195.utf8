The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Illegal ads get seven more days
                                                                                                               Illegal ads get seven more days
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          A billboard on the side of a main road                                  
	Cuttack, Aug. 23: Cuttack Municipal Corporation (CMC), which decided to pull down unauthorised billboards across the city, has given advertisers another weeks time to regularise them.        
	Sources said more than 400 such unauthorised giant hoardings had come up in the city. The civic body has been incurring heavy loss in terms of revenue.        
	If the persons or agencies concerned do not come forward and get the unauthorised hoardings enlisted within the next seven days, they will be removed, municipal commissioner S.K. Lohani warned through a public notice today.        
	The illegal hoardings had come up both on municipal and private lands. While advertisement agencies were putting up billboards on private land by paying the property holders, but many of them had come up on municipal lands with no names or addresses on the signposts.        
	Lohani said that the CMC expected the agencies to submit required applications and collect demand notices towards tax till March 2010 and deposit the amount accordingly within the deadline. The agencies were further expected to register themselves with CMC and deposit Rs 5,000 towards registration fee.        
	If the arrears and registration fee are not deposited, the unauthorised hoardings will be removed and the agencies and persons involved will bear the cost incurred for it. CMC will not be responsible for any loss incurred by the advertiser or private landholder, the municipal commissioner further warned.        
	CMC had earlier on April 25 issued a notification making registration and enlistment mandatory for putting up billboards and holdings within the city limits. But responses in connection with a large number of unauthorised hoardings were not received.        
	The sources said the civic administration had also decided to regulate the size of the hoardings, its distance from electricity cables, tree and buildings in nearby areas.         
	The hoardings in several instances violate civic norms. They are chaotically placed, sometimes at vantage points of the city blocking visibility in roads causing accidents, a CMC official said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Nov. 27: The Madhya Pradesh government today backed out of its much-criticised decision to open the Union Carbide factory premises to the public for a week on the 25th anniversary of the gas leak.        
	The site was to be opened tomorrow but the government cited the model code of conduct, in force for the state local body polls in December, to explain its about-turn.        
	Legal experts said opening the factory would not have violated the code, and rights activists protesting the earlier decision suggested the real reason was political  the BJP government feared reverses in the local polls if it went ahead with the move.        
	Protests had been raging in Bhopal since the government, two weeks ago, made the announcement about opening the premises that activists say are still stockpiled with toxic material. Many saw in the move a ploy to let the factorys current owner, Dow Chemicals, get away without cleaning up the hazardous waste.        
	The December 3, 1984, gas leak killed an estimated 8,000 people in three days and another 15,000 through the long-term effects of the methyl isocyanate gas. Some 100,000 continue to suffer chronic and debilitating illnesses, NGOs say, with toxic chemicals still polluting the soil and water in the neighbourhood.        
	The state government opens the premises every year on December 3 to observe a minutes silence in memory of the victims, but this year said it would open the gates for a week to dispel fears that the site was still harmful.         
	Madhya Pradesh High Court gave the government permission to keep the premises open for a week, provided safety precautions were taken and people kept at least 20 metres away from the actual factory.        
	Now the state government has decided not to open the premises even on December 3.        
	Making public the change of plans, the states relief and rehabilitation minister, Babulal Gaur, pointed to the code of conduct that forbids ministers from making major policy announcements ahead of polls. But legal experts debunked his logic.         
	The government has backed out for obvious political reasons. Gaur found it too hot to handle, said a member of Bhopal Group of Information and Action, a voluntary group working for the gas victims.        
	Gaur insisted: The factory will surely be opened, but maybe in January after the elections are over.

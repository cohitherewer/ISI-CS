	New Delhi, Jan. 13: B. Ramalinga Raju may have found himself in a better position today had he, instead of inflating Satyams profits, sought out traders with long fourth fingers.         
	Cambridge University researchers have said the finger lengths of traders might have a bearing on success in financial markets, adding fresh evidence for a connection between biology and the markets.        
	A research team exploring interconnections between neuroscience and financial markets has found that the ratio of the lengths of the second and fourth fingers can influence the profits of high-frequency traders.        
	The shorter the length of the second finger in contrast to the fourth finger, the more money a high-frequency trader is likely to make, the team has found.        
	So, if Raju had turned to those with long fingers, things may have been different. One of his suspected motives for fudging figures was to keep stock prices high to retain foreign institutional investors and avoid becoming a take-over target.        
	Neuroscientist John Coates and his colleagues from the department of economics measured finger length ratios of 44 high-frequency traders in London and studied their profit and loss statements over a 20-week period. The findings appeared yesterday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.         
	Several previous studies have suggested that the ratio of these finger lengths is a measure of the level of prenatal exposure to testosterone  a steroid hormone that regulates foetal development and masculine features.        
	Earlier research work has also shown that people with low digit ratios perform better in several sports, including basketball, football, and skiing.         
	Weve found a relationship between a biological marker set at birth and profit and loss among one class of traders, Coates told The Telegraph. This raises troubling questions about nature and nurture in the workplace.         
	In April last year, Coates had shown that increases in circulating testosterone led to short-term increases in traders profits.        
	Exposure to high levels of prenatal testosterone may translate into more confidence, an appetite for risk-taking, and faster reaction times, he said. Such traits could explain the effect of finger length ratios observed in sports as well as financial markets.        
	The Cambridge study was focused on high-frequency trading, a style that demands intense attention, constant scanning of prices and fast intellectual and physical reflexes. High-frequency traders hold their trade only for minutes, sometimes for mere seconds.        
	We were surprised to find that exposure to hormones in the womb had such a strong influence on future trading performance, Coates said. Testosterone surges between the 9th and 18th week of gestation influences the organisation of the body and the brain.        
	Coates has cautioned that the rule does not apply to all styles of financial trading. The correlation between the finger length ratios and profits may even reverse among more analytical traders, such as investors in mutual and pension funds and investment banks who take more time to analyse a securitys value and hold trades for weeks, months, or even years.        
	The markets need both short and long-term traders, just as an Olympic team needs sprinters and marathon runners, he said. Trouble is, in recent years, the short-term trading mentality has spread into asset management and banking.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Govt ad blitz before polls
                                                                                                               Govt ad blitz before polls
          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 28: The UPA government has kicked off an advertisement blitz on print and TV ahead of the polls, expectedly focusing on its aam aadmi schemes.        
	The expenditure finance committee has sanctioned the information and broadcasting (I amp;B) ministry Rs 50 crore as initial expenditure.        
	Ministry sources said the total budget could go up to Rs 400-500 crore, with each ministry expected to pitch in from the budget allocation for each scheme.        
	Sonia Gandhis picture appears on all the ads, though the Prime Minister is missing from some, such as those of the human resource development ministry.        
	Ministries run by regional parties  for instance, the telecom ministry headed by the DMKs A. Raja  have included pictures of their own leaders.        
	The ministries that have put out the highest number of ads include those involved in the rural job scheme, farm-loan waiver scheme, Sarva Siksha Abhiyan and the Prime Ministers 15-point programme for minority welfare.        
	Also being flogged are the rural health and urban renewal missions, the Right to Information Act, and the schemes relating to midday meal, child development, rural housing and roads, sanitation and old-age pension.        
	Ministries such as those for coal or for micro, small and medium enterprises too have put out full-page newspaper ads.        
	Some ministries are getting print space for maybe the first time in the past five years, an I amp;B ministry official said.        
	A source said the directorate of advertising and visual publicity (DAVP) had been wondering whether to have Sonias picture in the ads since the BJP had raised an outcry on the subject before. The BJPs argument is that Sonia is not part of the UPA government.        
	Since we did not receive any official directive on the matter, we went by the previous ads, a DAVP official said.        
	The directorate, a unit of the I amp;B ministry, manages government advertising campaigns and buys airtime on TV or space in the 4,000-odd national and regional newspapers registered with it. The government decides the rates in consultation with the media houses.        
	The DAVP is the largest advertiser in terms of volume, accounting for 10-20 per cent of all the ads publishers get, the official said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, June 11: Legislative Assembly Speaker Babasaheb Kupekar today asked the Maharashtra labour minister to inform the House about the number of locals and outsiders employed in the private sector in the state.        
	The directive came after BJP MLAs Vishnu Sawara and Dhananjay Patil alleged in the House that companies in Thane districts Shahapur town had recently recruited illegal migrants from Bangladesh and workers from other states, depriving the local people in the process.         
	Labour minister Nawab Malik informed the House that 91 per cent of the local working population had found employment in Shahapur.         
	Nationalist Congress Party MLA Shashikant Shinde said the minister had been wrongly briefed by his department. Members of the Shiv Sena-BJP combine also created a ruckus over the issue.        
	Kupekar then directed Malik to inform the House about the recruitment status in the state. Malik said a meeting would be held soon to conduct a review.

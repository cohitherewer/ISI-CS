	New Delhi, March 2: The 15th Lok Sabha elections, the first in which photo electoral rolls will be used around the country, will be held in five phases from April 16 under two chief election commissioners.        
	Chief election commissioner N. Gopalaswami, who will oversee only the first phase of polling before he retires on April 20, announced the schedule at a news conference this afternoon where he was flanked by colleagues Navin Chawla and S.Y. Quraishi.        
	Photo electoral rolls will be used throughout the country, except in Assam, Nagaland and Jammu and Kashmir.         
	Photographs of 82 per cent electors are printed in the electoral rolls. This will prevent impersonation and facilitate easy identification, an Election Commission handout said.         
	Voters who have been issued electors photo identity cards will be identified only by those, the handout said. A special drive will be undertaken to issue the cards to voters yet to receive them.         
	In another first, polls in all states except Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand, Manipur and Nagaland will be held in new constituencies redrawn after the delimitation.        
	The month-long election votes will be counted on May 16  is also the first in which the chief election commissioner will change mid-stream.        
	Navin Chawla, the senior of the two election commissioners, will take over from Gopalaswami when he retires. Another commissioner will be appointed to fill the vacancy in the three-member panel.        
	Gopalaswami, who sparked a controversy with his last-minute recommendation of Chawlas removal that was rejected by the government, talked animatedly with Quraishi. Chawla, who sat to his left, looked resolutely away.         
	The term of the 14th Lok Sabha expires on June 1, so the new House has to be constituted before June 2.         
	Assembly polls in Andhra Pradesh, Orissa and Sikkim will be held on the same days as the general election.         
	The model code of conduct came into force as soon as the elections were announced.        
	Under the code, governments cannot do anything which may have the effect of influencing voters in favour of the party in power, and political parties and candidates are forbidden from indulging in any corrupt practices.         
	Polling will be held over 28 days in five phases  April 16, April 23, April 30, May 7 and May 13.         
	Electronic voting machines will be used in all 8,28,804 polling stations. In 2004 also, when polling was held in four phases over 21 days, voting machines were used in all booths. However, the polling stations were fewer at 6,87,402.         
	All candidates will have to file two affidavits with their nomination papers that give information on criminal antecedents, if any, liabilities and assets and educational qualifications.         
	Nomination papers not accompanied by these documents will be rejected.

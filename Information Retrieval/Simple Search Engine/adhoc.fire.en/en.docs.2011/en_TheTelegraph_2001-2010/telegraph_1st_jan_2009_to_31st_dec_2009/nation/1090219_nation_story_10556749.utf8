The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Singh for PM, not Rahul: Cong
                                                                                                               Singh for PM, not Rahul: Cong
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              Manmohan, Rahul: Leader selected				                                 
	New Delhi, Feb. 18: The Congress today declared that Manmohan Singh, not Rahul Gandhi, will lead the party and the UPA into the forthcoming elections, ending speculation.        
	The official word came from science and technology minister Kapil Sibal. It is for the Congress leadership to decide when Rahul takes over the reins of the government. Manmohan Singh is our Prime Minister and we are going to elections with him as our PM, he said.        
	Sources said the Amethi MP was likely to take grandmother Indira Gandhis route to power and possibly serve as a minister under Singh if the Congress returned at the helm. He would not take a direct shot at the top job, sources said.        
	Not even if the Congress crosses the 160-170 mark, a source said. The party had won 145 seats in the 2004 election.        
	After Jawaharlal Nehrus death in 1964, Indira was nominated to the Rajya Sabha and inducted as information and broadcasting minister by then Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri.         
	After Shastri passed away in 1966, the then Congress president K. Kamaraj named her Prime Minister amid strong opposition from the party.        
	Sources said Sonia Gandhi didnt want Rahul to become a victim of the sudden rise and sudden fall that marked his father Rajiv Gandhis political career.         
	She wants him to go through the grind because she subscribes to the principle, first deserve, then desire, the source said.        
	Unlike Indira, Rajiv had an easy debut and a spectacular rise. He came into the Congress in 1981, a year after his brother Sanjay died and was elected an MP from Amethi. He became a political adviser to his mother and was appointed the president of the Youth Congress.        
	After Indira Gandhis assassination, he led the Congress to its biggest victory and was elected Prime Minister, only to lose power within five years. He was assassinated during the next election.         
	Prime Minister Singh himself had told aides he was keen to have Rahul as a junior minister in the PMO. But Sonia felt Rahul should cut his teeth in the organisation before looking at a position in the government.        
	Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari also confirmed that Singh would be the mascot. Manmohan Singh will lead the UPA into the election. Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi have affirmed the decision publicly. He was responding to the Shiv Senas offer of supporting NCP boss Sharad Pawar as the next Prime Minister.        
	The sources said the Congress was clear that Singh would be its face for Prime Minister and Sonia would soon seek endorsement of the stand from UPA allies. However, sources ruled out Singh contesting the polls.        
	On RJD leader Lalu Prasads remarks that the UPA would decide its prime ministerial candidate after talks with the Left, a Congress leader suggested the Bihar leader might have done so for his own reasons. Lalu Prasads desperate for the Lefts support in Bihar, so its his way of reaching out to them. He knows the Left will have problems with Manmohan Singh.

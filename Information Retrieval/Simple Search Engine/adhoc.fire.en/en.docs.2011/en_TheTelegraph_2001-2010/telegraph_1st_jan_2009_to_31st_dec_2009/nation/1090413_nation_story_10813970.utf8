The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Praveen shoots book barb at brother
                                                                                                               Praveen shoots book barb at brother
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                            Pramod, Praveen: Opposition conspiracy?                          
	Mumbai, April 12: Excerpts from a to-be-published book by Praveen Mahajan, carried by a Marathi daily today, have pitted brother against brother in the run-up to the elections.        
	In the book, Praveen, serving a life term for murdering eldest brother and BJP leader Pramod Mahajan in 2006, purportedly questions Pramods character and claims he was a hero and a villain.        
	Prakash Mahajan, the second of the Mahajan brothers (Praveen being the youngest), termed the allegations lies and an attempted character assassination arising out of a political conspiracy.        
	Praveen was always unemployed; his wife Sarangi loved to enjoy life without doing anything and he (Praveen) ran his household by blackmailing Pramod. Let Sarangi answer how she runs her house expenses now, said Prakash, a top leader of Raj Thackerays party, the MNS.        
	Sarangi, who was an activist of BJP student arm ABVP, was spotted by Pramod at a college fest where she performed a dance.        
	She became one of his close aides and Pramod later proposed his brothers hand for her in marriage. She was not liked by the rest of the family but Pramodji was fond of her, a local BJP source said.        
	Pramod was a spotless diamond, Prakash said. Praveen is the black sheep of the family. And the less said about his wife the better. She drove a wedge between Praveen and Pramod.        
	Asked what he meant by blackmail, Prakash kept quiet for a while and then said it had nothing to do with any character-related weakness in Pramodji Praveen was emotionally blackmailing Pramodji as he was like a son to him.        
	Responding to Prakashs allegations, Sarangi insisted the book was not an autobiography but an authentic account of certain incidents in Praveens life. She said it was not directed against any individual, party or group: It doesnt include the court statements which were in-camera.        
	Praveen had levelled allegations against Pramods character during his trial, prompting the judge to order his testimony to be recorded in-camera.        
	The excerpts say Pramod had the image of a fixer did not respect anyone, used to term L.K. Advanis speeches boring and bought everybody or scared them into submission. They accuse Pramod of using party funds for personal pleasure and of having affairs with several women, prompting wife Rekha to complain to Atal Bihari Vajpayee. They allege Pramods daughter, Poonam, had told Praveen her father took along a girlfriend during a 1992 foreign trip.        
	They add: Pramod supported the entire family after the death of our father in 1971. He was both a hero and a villain.        
	Prakash questioned the timing of the excerpts release ahead of the polls: Its a conspiracy to malign him and put pressure on the family.        
	After the BJP recently denied Poonam, 28, a poll ticket, she had said she was almost an outcaste to the local BJP. Her brother Rahul, too, had hit out at the state BJP.        
	Prakash said: How did this newspaper get access to Praveens book? He is still in jail. I wonder if the Congress-NCP government, in cahoots with jail authorities, saw this as good ammunition on election-eve.        
	He said the claim about Pramod raising his hand to beat their mother was false. The excerpts also claim that Sharad Pawar had helped Pramod with his nomination papers for the 1998 Rajya Sabha elections because the NCP boss didnt want rival Suresh Kalmadi (contesting as Shiv Sena-backed Independent) elected unopposed. Both won.

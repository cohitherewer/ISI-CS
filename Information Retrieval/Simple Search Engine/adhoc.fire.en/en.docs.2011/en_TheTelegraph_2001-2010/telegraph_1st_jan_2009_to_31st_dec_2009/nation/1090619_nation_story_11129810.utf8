          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 18: The Opposition today blamed the government for the death of sub-inspector Narasingh Mahakud, who was killed in a rebel encounter in Sambalpur on June 15.        
	Mahakud was 55-years-old and not trained to combat Maoists. Why was he asked to lead an anti-rebel operation? said senior Congress member S.S. Saluja, blaming senior officers for the death.         
	He also alleged that the sub-inspector was not provided a bullet proof jacket, a helmet and a green camouflage while he led the operation and added that TV footage showed that the senior officer was wearing a white shirt.        
	Salujas allegation gained the support of senior BJP legislator and former minister Jaynarayan Mishra, who said: Had he worn a helmet, his life might have been saved as he received a bullet injury on his neck, which a helmet would have prevented.        
	Mahakud who was leading a Special Operation Group team was killed during a gun-battle in a jungle near Gariakhman village under Kisinda police station area of Sambalpur on the night of June 15.         
	The Opposition also lambasted Naveen Patnaik government for its failure in utilising central funds available for police modernisation. A sum of Rs 300 crore was released from the 11th Finance Commission for modernisation of police forces during 2000-05. A sum of Rs 75 crore lapsed due to government neglect, Saluja alleged.        
	He also said that most of the arms and ammunition purchased under the over scheme was dumped in a store while rebels combated the forces with sophisticated weapons. Members also demanded a CBI probe into the arms purchase deal.         
	However, Naveen Patnaik, who also heads the home department, refuted allegations and claimed that his government had spent 97 per cent of the funds available under police scheme and more than 100 per cent of the funds for security-related expenditure.         
	The chief minister went on to accuse the Centre for not providing adequate support to states. While the state government has already recruited personnel for five India Reserve Battalions, we have still not been allotted adequate training slots in Central Police Training Academies for two of these battalions, said Naveen.         
	Despite repeated requests, assistance under the security-related expenditure has been reduced, he added.

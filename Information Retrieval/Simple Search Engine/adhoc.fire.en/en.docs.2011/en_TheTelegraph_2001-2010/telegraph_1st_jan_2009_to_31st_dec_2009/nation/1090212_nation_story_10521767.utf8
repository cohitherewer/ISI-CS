The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | NSG women terror alert 
                                                                                                               NSG women terror alert 
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                               
	Manesar (Haryana), Feb. 11: National Security Guard chief J.K. Dutt today warned that al Qaida could use women suicide bombers and biological weapons against India.         
	Mustafa Abu al-Yazid, an al Qaida leader believed to be dead, threatened in a video made public yesterday that India could expect more Mumbai-style strikes if it attacked Pakistan.         
	India sees the Mumbai attacks as a convergence of al Qaida, Taliban and the Lashkar-e-Toiba.         
	Dutt told a seminar today that al Qaidas reported training of 80 women suicide bombers should raise the question if any of them could be sent to India. Later, the director-general linked this to the need for a bigger role for women in security agencies.         
	Recent videos publicised by the Iraqi media showed a woman confessing she knew of al Qaida having used 28 of the 80 human bombs.         
	Officials discussed their experiences in Jammu and Kashmir with burqa-clad terrorists shooting at security forces. We did not know if they were men or women, said an NSG commando who was posted earlier in Kupwara.         
	Sources said the Intelligence Bureau and Research and Analysis Wing had been alerted on these potential threats alongside warnings about possible use of biological weapons.         
	The Mumbai attack was an audacious attempt by the Taliban-al Qaida-LeT combine to shape policies of three sovereign nation states that include the oldest democracy and the largest democracy, Dutt said.         
	The NSG chief said it was evident after the 9/11 attacks in the US that at least one group would stop at nothing. This thought process has been reinforced with the terror attack in Mumbai on November 26, 2008, he said.         
	Dutt also expressed concern about the threat from biological weapons, last known to be used in 1995 in Japan when over 10 people were killed in a Sarin gas attack in a subway by a domestic terrorist group.

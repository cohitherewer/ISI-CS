	New Delhi, Aug. 21: One hour of heavy rain today blew the roof off Delhis new airport and caused a yawning cave-in over an underground Metro tunnel, leaving two of the capitals showpiece projects in disarray.        
	The 15-foot-deep and 20-foot-wide crater that opened up on the arterial Raisina Road, metres from Parliament, offered a view of the pipes and metal beams that formed the Metro railways scaffolding below, as well as parts of a tunnel.        
	Its a busy stretch of road but, fortunately, water-logging had forced traffic to a crawl and there were no additions to the Metros ever-growing list of disasters.        
	The 87kph wind and 74mm rain that fell till 5.30pm Delhis first serious monsoon showers this season  swept away the temporary roof of the swank, Rs 500-crore domestic terminal, forcing passengers to wade ankle-deep water.        
	A flooded runway and a fall in visibility forced a two-hour disruption with several flights cancelled or rescheduled.        
	Due to high wind velocity and heavy rain, a few sheets of the roof came off in Terminal 1D. The maintenance team is working to clear the water and restore the displaced sheets, Arun Arora of Delhi International Airport Limited said. He added that 20 flights were delayed and 10 diverted.        
	The roof of the state-of-the-art domestic departure terminal, opened just three months ago, had leaked at several points even on July 26 when the city witnessed its first monsoon shower this year. The leaking water had caused the X-ray baggage-screening machines to stop working.        
	The stretch of Raisina Road that collapsed had been closed to traffic till a month and a half ago because of Metro construction. Its not clear if the road caved in because of the Metro construction or because of the heavy rain. Its too early to comment on this, said a Metro official.        
	Like the showpiece projects, the symbols of power too suffered. In the media room at the Congress headquarters, water leaked down the roof and gushed in through the open doors, aborting a news conference.        
	A short-circuit put paid to air-conditioned comfort, causing beads of sweat to form on the foreheads of All India Congress Committee office-bearers. B.K. Hariprasad, Congress general secretary, was holed up in his car for 30 minutes before he could step out.        
	Ordinary citizens, walking down waterlogged streets amid fallen trees and open drains, took the brunt.        
	I have been stuck at the India Gate circle for the past two hours, waiting for an auto. I am drenched and dont know what to do. I dont understand why every time it rains our civic system gives in. Why arent the authorities doing something? said Preeti, a college student.        
	Vehicles bobbed up and down in the water even in upscale localities such as the diplomatic enclave of Chanakyapuri and in Shanti Path, one of the widest city roads in the country. The US embassy looked like an island.        
	Massive traffic jams, such as the one on Parliament Street, extended up to 2km. However, the rain brought the temperature down from 35 degrees Celsius to 24 degrees.

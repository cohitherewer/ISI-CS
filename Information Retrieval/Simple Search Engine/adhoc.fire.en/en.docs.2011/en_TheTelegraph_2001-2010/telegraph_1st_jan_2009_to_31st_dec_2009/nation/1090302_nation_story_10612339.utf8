          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, March 1: Maoist rebels blew up railway tracks in a Bihar district and set a station on fire in another, disrupting services on the Patna-Howrah main line as they hit back against the recent arrest of several commanders.        
	The attack, which paralysed train traffic for over seven hours, came on a day the banned CPI(Maoist) called a bandh in Bihar, Bengal, Orissa, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh to protest the arrests.        
	Eastern Railway chief PRO A.K. Chandra said heavily armed guerrillas blasted the tracks near Bhalui halt in Lakhisarai district around 2 last night, barely 15 minutes after the Howrah-Mithila Express had crossed.         
	The blast uprooted both the up and down tracks, Chandra said. At least seven trains, including the Patna-Howrah Janshatabdi Express, were stranded for up to seven hours. Normal traffic was restored at 9.30am, Chandra added.        
	In Munger, dozens of guerrillas beat up the stationmaster of Ratanpur and set ablaze a portion of the station building last night.        
	The twin strikes gave railway minister Lalu Prasad a chance to lash out at his rival, chief minister Nitish Kumar. The law and order situation has gone haywire in Bihar, Lalu Prasad said.

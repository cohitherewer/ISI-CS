The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Congress meeting this week
                                                                                                               Congress meeting this week
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 25: Sonia Gandhi has convened a meeting of the Congress Working Committee tentatively on January 29.        
	While Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will certainly miss the sitting of the Congresss highest decision-making body, Sonia is checking to see if other senior members will be around on that date.        
	As the CWC last met shortly after the Mumbai attacks, sources said this meeting was expected to discuss the developments that followed and analyse their impact.        
	The Congress has taken note of a comment by Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi, who said a mere statement from Ajmal Kasab, the lone terrorist taken alive, did not constitute evidence under Indian laws.        
	The party demanded an apology from Modi and alleged that he helped Pakistan when it was getting internationally isolated.        
	The CWC was also expected to exchange notes on the state of election preparedness.

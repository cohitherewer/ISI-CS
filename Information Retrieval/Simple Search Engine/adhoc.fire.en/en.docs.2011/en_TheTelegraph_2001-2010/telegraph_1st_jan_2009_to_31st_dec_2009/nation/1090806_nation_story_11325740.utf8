The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Strike smog on banking 
                                                                                                               Strike smog on banking 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 5: Brace for nearly a week of crippled banking.        
	Some ATMs could run out of cash over the next two days and cheques may be held up longer as a result of the August 6-7 strike by nine lakh employees of public sector banks over wage hike demands.        
	The disruptions will not wait for tomorrow morning. We are going on strike from Wednesday-Thursday midnight. There will no night clearance (of cheques) today, said an SBI Staff Association leader.         
	The association is part of the United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBU), the umbrella organisation of five workers and four officers unions that has called the two-day shutdown.        
	ATMs within branches would be shut but the rest  standalone ones called offsite ATMs by bankers  are likely to be open. But nobody was offering guarantees.         
	We wont force the (offsite) ATMs to close, but our demonstration will continue, the union leader said.         
	Problems could arise even if they are open. The strike could pose hurdles to the normal refilling of cash. According to a bank official, depending on the location, cash needs to be filled in offsite ATMs two to three times a day.        
	An SBI official said the bank was refilling cash at its ATMs up to the brim on a war footing to avoid cash shortage on Thursday and Friday.        
	Cheque clearing, though, could be delayed till next week in a spillover effect because the strike will be followed by a weekend. It may take a few days from Monday onwards to clear pending cheques because of this strike, said an official at a public sector bank.        
	The cost to the economy from payment problems will be greater given that cheques worth nearly Rs 40,000 crore, of all banks combined, are cleared on average daily.        
	Net banking, normally immune to such disruptions, may be affected as servers could go on the blink if the officials manning them dont turn up.        
	New private-sector banks such as ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Axis Bank, which dont have unions, said they would stay open but didnt rule out the possibility of shutting down in case of trouble.        
	If there is a bandh or strike call from other banks, we may have to comply with that depending on the situation. However, we have got no official communication on whether we should keep our banks closed tomorrow and the day after. Well have to see the situation tomorrow, an ICICI Bank official said.        
	However, an HDFC Bank said from Mumbai that private banks had never been and wouldnt be a part of a strike called by public sector banks. Well work as usual.        
	PSU bank employees are demanding a 20 per cent hike and other benefits. The Indian Banks Association (IBA), which represents the management, had offered 17.5 per cent in June  subject to the Centres approval. But it cut the raise to 13 per cent at a meeting yesterday, on the Centres advice.

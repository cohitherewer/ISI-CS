The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | General faces amnesty anger 
                                                                                                               General faces amnesty anger 
          SUJAN DUTTA                                    
	New Delhi, Feb. 27: The Bangladesh Army is seething with rage after its chief General Moeen U. Ahmed accepted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasinas offer of a general amnesty to the mutineers who massacred officers, information reaching here from Dhaka suggests.        
	With anger mounting with the discovery of mass graves inside the Bangladesh Rifles headquarters today, Hasina has modified the amnesty offer.         
	The Prime Minister said the people directly involved in the killings will not be pardoned and would not be covered under the general amnesty.         
	If the modification fails to stem the resentment against the army chief, it will be bad news for India.         
	General Moeen Ahmed had broken the tradition of spurning invitations from the Indian Army and visited New Delhi exactly a year ago. He was received with great pomp and ceremony and granted audience not only by the service chiefs but also by the most senior political leaders.        
	The Indian Army that profiled his interests and learnt of his fondness for equestrian sports summoned its Remount Veterinary Corps and ordered it to find the choicest of thoroughbreds to gift to the general.        
	The gift horses signalled the resumption of a military-to-military relationship that began and ended with the Indian Army and the Mukti Joddha that drove Pakistan out of East Pakistan and gave birth to Bangladesh in 1971.         
	Indias favourite Bangladeshi general is today being accused in whispers which are in danger of rolling into a cacophony that he has given in to the political whim of a government in a country where the army has so often called the shots.        
	The tanks the army rolled out in Dhaka yesterday were meant to fire into Pilkhana where the Bangladesh Rifles mutineers were, not engage in an empty show of threat, the sources said.        
	The flipside of this argument was illustrated in a meeting the US ambassador to Bangladesh, James Moriarty, had with Hasina yesterday. Moriarty is understood to have praised her for acting with restraint despite the gravest of threats. The US ambassador also met the Opposition BNP chief, Khaleda Zia.         
	Elements of the BNP and the Jamaat are suspected to have fanned the mutiny outside Dhaka yesterday taking advantage of grievances BDR soldiers have on pay, perks and UN postings.        
	Details of the talks were not immediately available but the US has been keen that India plays a stabilising role in the South Asian region. It is in this context that the Indian effort to send a peace mission, not only for the security of the train service between Dhaka and Calcutta, but also in a larger context, preferably on an appeal from Dhaka, will be internationally acceptable to Washington.        
	The peace mission suggestion involving police forces in the train  essentially the Railway Protection Force  is fraught with technicalities because the agreement on the passenger service specifies that each country will be responsible for security in its own territory. But because the BDR is now practically without personnel beyond its officers, the offer from New Delhi carries some merit.        
	Delhi also understands that if Hasina were to make a public appeal for Indian help, she will throw herself open to Right-wing criticism from the BNP and the Jamaat.        
	For the time being, India and Bangladesh have decided that the Calcutta-Dhaka Moitree Express passenger train will run tomorrow, even if there are only a handful of passengers, with BDR officers manning the gates on the Bangladeshi side.

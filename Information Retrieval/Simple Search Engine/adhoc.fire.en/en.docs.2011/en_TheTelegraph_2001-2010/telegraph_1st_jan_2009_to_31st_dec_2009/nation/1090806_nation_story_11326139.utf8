                                                                                                               Imphal probe into encounter
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Imphal, Aug. 5: Manipur chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh today ordered a judicial inquiry into the July 23 police encounter that killed a Peoples Liberation Army cadre.         
	The chief minister, who took the step apparently under pressure from Union home minister P. Chidambaram and other Congress MPs whom he met in Delhi yesterday, also suspended six policemen, including one sub-inspector.         
	We have decided to conduct a judicial inquiry to find out the facts. The government does not want to hide the facts. More action will be taken as per the findings of the inquiry, the chief minister told reporters here.         
	Ibobi Singh said sub-inspector Punshiba Singh had reported that C.H. Sanjit had resorted to indiscriminate firing that killed Rabina Devi, a pregnant woman. The rebel was killed in the subsequent encounter.         
	But photographs published by a Delhi-based portal showed policemen leading Sanjit to a pharmacy and emerging with his body.        
	Street protests have rocked Imphal over the last few days with people clashing with the police and demanding a probe into the incident.

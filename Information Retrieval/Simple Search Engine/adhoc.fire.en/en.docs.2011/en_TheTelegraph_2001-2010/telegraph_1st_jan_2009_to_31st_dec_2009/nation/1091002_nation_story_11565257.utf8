          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Ahmedabad, Oct. 1: Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi today hijacked a Congress meeting on Sardar Patel to hit out at the Nehru-Gandhis, a move aimed at projecting himself as the torchbearer of the iconic leaders legacy.        
	Had Sardar Patel become the countrys first Prime Minister, the story would have been different. There would have been no terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir and farmers in Maharashtra would not have committed suicide, Modi said in a veiled attack on the Nehru-Gandhis.         
	The chief minister was speaking at a meeting organised by the Sardar Patel Memorial Society in the presence of President Pratibha Patil.         
	Modi was not initially invited to the meeting but, sources said, feelers were sent to Dinsha Patel, Union minister and chairman of the society, that the chief minister be called.        
	Modi began by praising Sardar Patel for his foresight and visionary leadership, but soon launched a vicious attack on Jawaharlal Nehru. He accused the first Prime Minister of being the root cause of all problems, especially terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir.        
	Modi said that a month before his death in December 1950, Sardar Patel had sent a letter to Nehru, warning him about the evil designs of China, a country the then deputy Prime Minister asserted shouldnt be trusted. Our defence policy towards China should have been changed, Modi said. Nehru, the chief minister pointed out, did not take the advice seriously. As a result we are facing the consequences today, he added.         
	In the same vein, Modi said that if Sardar Patel, the son of a farmer, had become Prime Minister, agrarian suicides would not have taken place.         
	Modis diatribe followed a message from Sonia Gandhi, who dismissed claims that Nehru and Patel had unbearable disagreements.        
	Sources in the BJP said Modi was keen to be seen as the carrier of the Sardars legacy, a role so far performed in the party by L.K. Advani.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Child food kitty gets bigger
                                                                                                               Child food kitty gets bigger
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 20: The Centre has doubled its financial commitment to the supplementary nutrition of every child under 6, accepting that its battle against malnutrition has proved inadequate even for those who have benefited.        
	The government will now spend Rs 4 a day on supplementary nutrition of every child instead of Rs 2 under the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS), women and child development ministry officials have said.        
	The notification for the increased financial support has already been issued and the ministry is finalising norms for the use of the extra money, the officials said.         
	The ICDS, launched in 1975, is the worlds largest programme for providing supplementary nutrition to children under 6. It is provided through some seven lakh anganwadi centres across the country, but its reach is still limited to 7 crore of the over 16 crore children under 6.        
	The Supreme Court has ordered the universalisation of the ICDS. India is also a signatory to the United Nations Millennium Development Goals, which include eradication of child malnutrition.         
	But studies over the past few years have repeatedly shown that the ICDS is failing to help prevent malnutrition even among those it reaches. The spread of malnutrition in India is worse than in many countries of sub-Saharan Africa, UN reports have said.         
	We want to try and ensure that the increased financial commitment can help correct this embarrassment, a senior ministry official said. Most studies, the official said, have shown that on an average, Indian children under 6 are 500 calories short on daily nutrition.        
	However, the ICDS, which aims to meet this gap through supplementary nutrition, has so far provided only 300 calories for each child per day. The new norms aim to provide 500 calories, the official said.         
	The ministry also hopes to finance an increased micro-nutrient intake from the hike in per-child expenditure. We hope the increased per child financial commitment can fund a combination of a hike in calories and more micro-nutrients in the supplementary nutrition, the official said.         
	The form of the changed nutrition is still uncertain as minister Renuka Chowdhurys move to introduce fortified pre-cooked food at anganwadi centres continues to remain mired in opposition from within the government.        
	The cabinet under Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had last year formed a group of ministers to prepare a blueprint for the universalisation of freshly cooked meals across anganwadis under the ICDS.         
	Chowdhury, sources said, has called for a meeting of the group of ministers where she plans to argue in favour of providing fortified food where fresh meals cannot be cooked because of lack of infrastructure.

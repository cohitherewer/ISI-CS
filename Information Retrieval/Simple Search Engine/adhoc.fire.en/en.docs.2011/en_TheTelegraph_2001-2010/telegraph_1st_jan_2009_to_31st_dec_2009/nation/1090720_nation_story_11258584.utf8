The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Smelling blood, BJP raises Pak tempo
                                                                                                               Smelling blood, BJP raises Pak tempo
          SANJAY K. JHA                           Advani: Tough talk                                  
	New Delhi, July 19: The BJP has demanded suspension of all talks with Pakistan till the neighbour takes credible action against the Mumbai attack perpetrators, sensing an opportunity to take on the Manmohan Singh government for the first time after the elections.        
	Leader of Opposition L.K. Advani led the offensive today, saying the decision to de-link terrorism from the composite dialogue process was unacceptable. He pointed to the Sharm-al-Sheikh joint statement, released after talks between Manmohan Singh and Pakistan Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani last week.        
	Advani said the national consensus to fight terrorism had been undermined by the UPA and most Indians, including a section of the Congress, were worried over the July 16 joint statement, which he described as a major diplomatic surrender on Indias part.         
	The BJP has decided to play up the issue before the Assembly elections later this year in Maharashtra, where the 26/11 attack had triggered protests against the Centres perceived soft approach towards terrorism.         
	Whatever Prime Minister Singh may have said later by way of clarification, he has agreed in black and white that India is ready to discuss all issues with Pakistan, including Kashmir, and that such a dialogue will not be linked to action on terrorism, Advani said.        
	He asked the government to seek the extradition of all those involved in cross-border terror against India and sheltered in Pakistan, such as Dawood Ibrahim.        
	The government must insist on time-bound dismantling of anti-India terrorist infrastructure on Pakistani soil, said a statement put out by the BJP after his speech at a programme in Pune.        
	Advani said the Sharm-al-Shelikh statement only spoke of action on terrorism without explicitly saying Pakistans action on terrorism. This, he said, was ominous because of what has been put down in the preceding sentence. Prime Minister Gilani mentioned that Pakistan has some information on threats in Baluchistan and other areas.        
	Advani said for the first time, India had allowed Pakistan to mention Baluchistan in a formal statement, and that too in a way that India is made to look like the sponsor of terrorism there. In other words, the perpetrator of terrorism, which is what Pakistan really is, has succeeded, with the Indian governments help, to project itself as a victim of India-sponsored terrorism, he said.

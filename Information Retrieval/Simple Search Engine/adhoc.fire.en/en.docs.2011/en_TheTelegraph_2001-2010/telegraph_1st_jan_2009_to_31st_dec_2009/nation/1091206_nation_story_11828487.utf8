          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Dec. 5: The first SOS had come from the chief minister  the Sun Temple was headed for ruin.        
	Now Orissa High Court has admitted a public interest petition that wants to know what steps are being taken to protect the 13th-century architectural wonder.        
	A month after Naveen Patnaik drew Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs attention to the temples neglect, a two-judge high court bench on Thursday issued notices to the director-general of the Archaeological Survey of India to file an affidavit in response to the PIL.        
	Naveens SOS had brought a high-level ASI committee headed by joint director-general B.R. Mani to inspect the heritage structure on October 20 and 21. But the report on the panels findings is yet to be passed on to the Orissa government.        
	The ASI is in charge of conserving the monument, visited by hundreds of thousands of tourists every year, but conservationists want an expert panel to be set up, which, in turn, would suggest a long-term plan to preserve the Black Pagoda, as the British named it.        
	Several memoranda for forming a committee had been submitted to the ASI, Union ministers and the state government, but the demands went unheeded.        
	The chairman of the Konark Notified Area Council, Japani Naik, and 28 local groups, including the Konark Surakhshya Samiti, have now brought the matter to the courts notice through the PIL.         
	The PIL is expected to bring into focus the necessity of forming a committee with representatives from the ASI, the Orissa government and local bodies to monitor the conservation process, counsel for the petitioners, P.K. Praharaj, told The Telegraph today.        
	The Surakhshya Samiti, which has been spearheading a movement for conserving the structure, says the ASI isnt serious about protecting the temple, built in black granite by King Narasimhadeva-I.        
	No concrete steps have been taken and the work done so far is superficial, which has caused more harm than good, it claims.         
	A proper drainage system has not been made causing submergence of major parts of the structure during rains. Water-logging is weakening the foundations and the super structure of the temple, said Samiti president Sarat Jay Singh.         
	Besides, cleansing on the outside is being done by unskilled workmen who use rough brushes, causing obliteration of many fine miniature sculptures.        
	The petition has also sought a directive to allow free daily worship of the image of the Sun God in the Chaya Maya temple within the precincts of the Sun Temple.

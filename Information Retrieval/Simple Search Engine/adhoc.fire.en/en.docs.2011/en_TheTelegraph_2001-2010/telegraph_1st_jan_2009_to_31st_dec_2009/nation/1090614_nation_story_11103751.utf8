The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Quota bane for rebels
                                                                                                               Quota bane for rebels
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, June 12: Few would have considered Laxmi Devi, 35, a land-less Dalit woman surviving on manual labour, as leader material, till the government reserved a seat for the likes of her in panchayats.        
	But Laxmi did become the mukhiya of Sakardas (Gaya) two years ago.        
	A fewer still realised the impact which a decision taken by the Nitish Kumar-led government to reserve 50 per cent seat in local bodies for women and introduce a quota-within-quota for SC, ST, EBC and OBC women would have.        
	While the suddenness of the decision caught the militant upper-caste Rajputs, who occupied the post of the Sakardas mukhiya for five decades, unawares, Dalits, serving as Maoist cadre, hurried to select a candidate.         
	The cheerful wife of a relatively vocal labourer, Wakil Ram, emerged as the communitys choice for the post and Laxmi won. Initially, Laxmi worked under the tutelage of her husband who officiated with the sobriquet mukhiya pati (mukhiyas spouse).         
	However, she came into her own eventually while dealing with the administration and block officials and scheme enforcing agencies. In two years time Laxmi emerged as a testimony to what empowering people at the grassroots can do for a government.         
	Sakardas panchayat, comprising 4,000 residents and divided into Nawada, Kobwa, Gharya, Majhauli and Sakardas villages, is now almost free of Maoists, a group that dominated there for three decades.        
	Laxmi, hailing from Mathura Tola, a part of Kobwa where only Dalits live, got all 200 Dalit families registered under the BPL list entitling them to free grain and employment under the NREGS. It is now difficult to draft youths in the cadre with them getting work elsewhere, said Vinit Rai (name changed), a central committee member of the CPI(Maoist),        
	Anthropologist Vijay Kumar Singh told The Telegraph: As far as I see, empowerment of the weak and women is the single-most important factor to decrease Naxalite clout. Laxmi replaced Kranti Singh, a land-owning Rajput, as the mukhiya and became an easier link between the people and the government machinery.        
	The transfer of political power from the feudal class to the weaker sections gave the rest of the weaker sections a feeling of being empowered.        
	At the presidential address to the joint Houses of the Parliament Manmohan Singh talked of the Bihar model of quota at the grassroots all across the country.         
	The measure if adopted will go a long way in establishing peace and prosperity in hinterlands. After all, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has described Naxalites as the biggest threat to internal security, Singh said.

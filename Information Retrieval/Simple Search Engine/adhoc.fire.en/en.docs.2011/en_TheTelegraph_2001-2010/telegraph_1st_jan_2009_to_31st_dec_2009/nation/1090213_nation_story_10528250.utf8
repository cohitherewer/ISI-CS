The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong smug but cautious
                                                                                                               Cong smug but cautious
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 12: The Congress is happy with Pakistans qualified acceptance of the Mumbai attack evidence but wary of the neighbours real intention.        
	A cabinet minister who summed up the mood in the government and the party said we have won on every front, while warning that you can never tell with Pakistan if its for real or a smokescreen for an insidious agenda.        
	Maybe, it (the acceptance of proof) is a ruse to tell the US we (Pakistan) have honoured our part of the bargain, now India should be cajoled to part with (Mohammed Ajmal) Kasab. Theyll probably say they cannot act upon the evidence unless Kasab is handed over. India will not do it. Otherwise, we have won on every front, he added.        
	Congress sources said the biggest political fallout of todays development was that it had punctured the BJPs nationalist plank. Islamabads gesture has come days after BJP leaders at the partys national executive in Nagpur accused the UPA government of not doing enough to force something concrete from Pakistan.         
	We came this far without jingoism or sabre-rattling. It is something the Opposition must pay heed to, said the Congresss Salman Khurshid. Sources said the next time L.K. Advani, Narendra Modi and others assailed the Congress for going soft on terror, the party was armed with a strong counterpoint.         
	Another Congress leader compared the Centres position on the Mumbai attacks with the 1999 Kandahar hijack. We only need to remind people of what (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee, Advani and Jaswant Singh did after the hijack, see off hardcore terrorists to their homeland in style. We stood our ground with Pakistan and won.         
	Party sources said they were particularly happy with foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee and home minister P. Chidambaram.        
	Not once did they sound out of step or speak at variance in projecting Indias case internationally. They kept Pakistan on its toes, said the Congress leader, scoffing at the BJPs suggestion that Islamabad had buckled under pressure from the US, not India.

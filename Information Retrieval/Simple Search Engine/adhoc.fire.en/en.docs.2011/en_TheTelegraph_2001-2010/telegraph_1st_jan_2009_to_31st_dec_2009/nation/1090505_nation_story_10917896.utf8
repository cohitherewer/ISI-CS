          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, May 4: The CPM has thrown its weight behind Kerala state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan in the SNC Lavalin power scam case.        
	At a meeting of the state secretariat yesterday in Thiruvananthapuram, also attended by party general secretary Prakash Karat, the CPM decided to go with the legal opinion given by the Kerala advocate-general against prosecuting Vijayan.        
	Sources said the partys calculation was other partners of the ruling Left Democratic Front would not object to such a stand.

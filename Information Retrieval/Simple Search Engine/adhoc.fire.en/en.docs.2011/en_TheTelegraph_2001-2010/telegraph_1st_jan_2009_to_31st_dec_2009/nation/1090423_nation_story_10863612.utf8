The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Quiet canvass for tribal votes
                                                                                                               Quiet canvass for tribal votes
          JAYANTH JACOB IN BETUL                                            
	Sureshi Yadav doesnt mind saying aloud he is a Congress supporter. But the resident of Chikla, a tribal village on the outskirts of Betul, says he came to know elections were on April 23 just two days back when he saw the closed-down liquor shops and the unusual number of policemen milling around.        
	Some 70km away in Ambada, Suraj Mankar, too, says neither the Congress nor the BJP has campaigned in his village of 120 tribal families.        
	Both the Congress and the BJP want to add tribal votes to their kitty across Madhya Pradesh, but campaigning for their support has been a quiet affair in Betul Lok Sabha constituency, though tribals account for 5.5 lakh of the 12-lakh electorate here.        
	In Chikla and Ambada, people speak about the rural employment guarantee scheme with a sense of gratitude. But people here tend to credit the BJP for the UPA governments flagship programme. We dont see any Congress worker telling us otherwise, says Navaal, a labourer.        
	I know the Congress is giving the jobs. But in my village of 80 families, people think otherwise, rues Yadav.        
	You cant blame them. While BJP chief minister S.S. Chauhan addressed four rallies in the constituency and party leader Sushma Swaraj visited twice, the only big Congress leader who was here was Kamal Nath  on the day party candidate Ozha Ram Ivne filed his nomination.        
	Congress leaders, however, say their candidate  a son of the soil  will win. His BJP opponent, Jyoti Dhruve, is not a real tribal, they say. Our candidate is a real tribal, says Vinod Daga, a former MLA.        
	Daga says the influence of the RSS among the tribals is on the wane and the situation is not like 2003, when the Congress lost all eight Assembly seats in Chhindwara, Naths stronghold. The tribals are realising the importance of being with the Congress.        
	 Betul votes on April 23

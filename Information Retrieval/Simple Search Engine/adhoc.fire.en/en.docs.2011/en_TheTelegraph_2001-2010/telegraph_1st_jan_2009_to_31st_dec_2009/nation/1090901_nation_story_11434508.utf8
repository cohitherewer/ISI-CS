The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Buta CBI nod
                                                                                                               Buta CBI nod
                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 31 (PTI): Buta Singh, the chairman of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes, today told Delhi High Court he was willing to be questioned by the CBI in connection with a bribery case involving his son.         
	Buta, who had earlier said the CBI did not have the authority to question a constitutional functionary without the Centres sanction, agreed to appear before the investigating agency after it clarified that he would be quizzed as a witness and not an accused.         
	He said he would be available to the CBI on September 10 at 11am in his office.        
	Justice Geeta Mittal, after recording the statement given by Butas counsel, asked the agency to question him on that day.        
	The CBI had arrested Butas son Sarobjit on July 31 for allegedly demanding a bribe of Rs 1 crore from a Nashik-based contractor to close an atrocity case against him pending before the commission headed by his father.        
	The high court had on August 26 sought a response from the CBI on a petition filed by Buta, accusing the agency of illegally summoning him.

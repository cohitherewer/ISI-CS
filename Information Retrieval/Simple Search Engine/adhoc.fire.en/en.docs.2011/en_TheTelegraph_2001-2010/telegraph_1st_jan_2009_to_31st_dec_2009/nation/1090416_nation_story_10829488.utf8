	Mumbai, April 15: A foreign student of a well-known Mumbai institution was allegedly raped by six youths in a flat away from the campus, she has said in her police complaint.        
	The 23-year-old claimed that the youths, who apparently gave her spiked drinks, were fellow students at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences. TISS has denied it.        
	Three of the youths, all said to be between 20 and 25, have been arrested. The rest are absconding. Deputy commissioner of police Dilip Sawant said one of those arrested had claimed he was from TISS.         
	The incident was reported on Monday morning. One of the three we have arrested has claimed he is a TISS student, the others are local residents. We are investigating the matter and establishing the identities of the accused, Sawant said. But TISS director S. Parasuraman told PTI those involved in the crime were outsiders.         
	Another police officer said the girl had not approached the police immediately as she was shattered and didnt know what to do.        
	The girl has said in her complaint that on Sunday she went with two of the boys, whom she described as friends in the complaint, to a restaurant in suburban Chembur, not far from where the institute is located.         
	After that, she went to an apartment owned by one of the two youths in Andheri, where the other four were already waiting, she said in the FIR. She has alleged that the duo had given her drinks while they were driving to the flat, DCP Sawant said, adding that the drink might have been spiked.        
	The police suspect the youth who claims to be a TISS student, identified as E. Kundan, planned the alleged assault. Sawant said a medical examination had been conducted on the victim and a report was awaited.        
	Joint police commissioner K.L. Prasad refused to divulge the victims nationality. It is not appropriate to reveal these details. Necessary information would be provided only after the investigation is over.        
	TISS issued a statement saying it condemned the incident and was taking all necessary steps to ensure that justice was done. The student (the victim) is being provided all support, including legal assistance and counselling, the statement said. It stressed the fact that TISS was committed to the well-being and safety of its students.         
	Parasuraman, too, said the victim, a postgraduate student, would get all support to protect her dignity. Justice should be given to the victim. Protecting her from further mental trauma is our first priority, he said.

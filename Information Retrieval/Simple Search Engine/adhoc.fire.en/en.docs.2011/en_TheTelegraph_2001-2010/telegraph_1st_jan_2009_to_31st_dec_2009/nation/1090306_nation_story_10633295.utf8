	 Bhubaneswar: The Biju Janata Dal is not telling if its 10-year alliance with the BJP, under strain after attacks on Christians by suspected Sangh supporters, is still on.           A hint was expected at the celebration of Biju Patnaiks birth anniversary on Thursday, but BJD chief Naveen Patnaik chose silence.          
	Pyari Mohan Mohapatra, a Rajya Sabha MP who is seen as Naveens principal adviser, asked workers to ensure the partys victory in at least 100 of the total 147 Assembly seats.           
	Led by Mohapatra, a section of the BJD has been demanding a bigger share of seats.           
	The BJP is insisting on the old formula  12 Lok Sabha seats and 84 Assembly seats for the BJD and nine Lok Sabha seats and 63 Assembly seats for the BJP.           
	Naveen said: Discussions are on and its premature to comment.          In what could strain ties further, two BJP MLAs have quit the party for the BJD. Dhaneswar Majhi, 68, and Sanand Marandi, 38, said the BJD has promised them Lok Sabha tickets.

	 Bangalore: Nirmala Venkatesh, sacked from the National Commission for Women after she commented on the attire of women attacked in a Mangalore pub by members of a saffron outfit, joined the BJP on Thursday. Venkatesh, who quit the Congress earlier in the week, said she hoped to contest the election. At least they (BJP) have recognised my honesty, she said.

Chandrababu Naidu hopes TVs will put him back in the picture in Andhra Pradesh.The Telugu Desam boss on Thursday promised free colour TVs to one crore poor families to drive ignorance and lack of information out of their lives if he was voted back to power.

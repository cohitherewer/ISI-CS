The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bengali ousts Bengali
                                                                                                               Bengali ousts Bengali
          AMIT ROY                          Isa in action                                  
	London, March 6: One Bengali girl has replaced another as the worlds top bowler, with Isa Guha, the medium pacer from England, taking over as leader of the pack from Jhulan Goswami of India.        
	There will be no claws at dawn, though.        
	They are good friends, very good friends, laughed Isas businessman father, Barun Guha, as he spoke to The Telegraph today from Wellington in New Zealand.        
	He said: Isa has been number one for about eight weeks  Jhulan was number one but was knocked out by Isa.        
	Barun, on his way to Australia for the womens World Cup with wife Roma, said: I took Isa to Calcutta in October and Jhulan came and spent a whole day with us.        
	Isa, now 23, was born and brought up in the UK where she has learnt her cricket but her parents emigrated to England from Calcutta.        
	Isa loves Calcutta  she loves being there, meeting her grandmother, eating fish and learning to speak Bengali, said Barun. Isa has indeed turned out to be a good Bengali girl  good at sport and good at studies.        
	She took a degree in bio-chemistry last year (from University College London), her father said. She had taken a year off from studies because of the World Cup but when she returns to England, she wants to do a PhD and after that do research in cancer.        
	For now, Isa is focused on the World Cup in which one of the opening games is England versus Sri Lanka in Canberra tomorrow. She was due to share a signal honour with another England player, Claire Taylor, a prolific scorer who heads the batting in the Reliance Mobile ICC ODI Womens Player Rankings.        
	Among bowlers, Isa is number one with 719 points and a bowling average of 18.43 while Jhulan has slipped to number three with 667 points and an average of 22.23, behind Australias Shelley Nitschke who has 677 points and an average of 22.30.        
	Incidentally, the fourth position is occupied by Australias Lisa Sthalekar, an Indian-origin player who was born in Pune. Lisa is second in the batting rankings, just ahead of Indias Mithali Raj, and number one among all-rounders.        
	Although relatively slight of frame, Isa uses her bowling technique to good effect. In the field, she is a quick mover and tends to pick up most catches.        
	According to a statement today from the ICC, when the ICC Womens World Cup gets under way on Saturday, there will be more than just team glory to play for as there will also be the battle for the coveted top spots. England teammates Claire Taylor and Isa Guha start the tournament in the lead positions in the batting and bowling lists, respectively, and to signify their status, both will wear the golden armbands awarded to the leading players in each category.        
	The women will wear dark armbands for the opening fixtures as a mark of respect to Sri Lankan cricketers hurt in the Lahore ambush.

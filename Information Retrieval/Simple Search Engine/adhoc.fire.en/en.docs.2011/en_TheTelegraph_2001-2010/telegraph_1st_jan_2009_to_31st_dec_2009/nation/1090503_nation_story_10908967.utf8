The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Apex court fast-tracks Gujarat riot cases
                                                                                                               Apex court fast-tracks Gujarat riot cases
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, May 2: The Supreme Court has refused to transfer eight major Gujarat riot cases outside the state but put them on fast track with stringent ground rules for free and fair trial, including appointment of new prosecutors.        
	The order, six years after the national rights commission had requested the court to shift the cases outside BJP-ruled Gujarat, also gave sweeping powers to the special investigation team it had set up to probe allegations of botched inquiry by state police.        
	Considering the nature and sensitivity of these cases, specially designated fast-track courts will hold day-to-day hearing of these cases. Trial shall be concluded as fast as possible, a three-judge bench said yesterday.        
	The order, in the middle of elections, came as fodder for parties on either side of the divide. While the Congress hailed it as historic and said the state government and chief minister Narendra Modi were on trial for the 2002 mayhem, the BJP claimed it was a slap in the face of those against Gujarat.        
	Among the cases where the accused will go on trial as soon as the states chief justice notifies six fast-track courts are the Godhra train burning case, the Naroda Gam and Naroda Patiya massacres, the Gulbarg Society mayhem and the killing of two British nationals in Sabarkantha district.        
	In its order, the bench said the special investigation teams opinion on the appointment of public prosecutors and protection for witnesses would be final and binding.        
	This is essentially to obliterate the apprehension that the public prosecutor is not fair in court or is not conducting the prosecution in a proper manner. (The) Gujarat government shall appoint public prosecutors in each of the cases in consultation with the SIT whose opinion shall be final and binding on the government, the court said.        
	The court  which had in 2004 transferred the Best Bakery massacre case to Maharashtra for retrial that led to the conviction of nine accused  said supplementary chargesheets would have to be filed in cases where the SIT has found investigations by state police wanting.        
	Supplementary chargesheets shall be filed in each of these cases as the SIT has found further material and/or has identified other accused against whom charges are to be brought, the bench said.        
	The SIT, it added, shall keep track of the progress of the trial in order to ensure that they are proceeding smoothly and shall submit quarterly report to this court.        
	The SIT had earlier reopened cases against several top Gujarat leaders, including minister Maya Kodnani, and recommended that bail of several suspects be cancelled.        
	The court, however, kept pending the petition seeking transfer of the cases, indicating perhaps that it might consider it at a later stage in a solace of sorts for the victims and a possible warning for the state government.        
	Modi contempt        
	Narendra Modi faces a contempt petition in the apex court for imputing in an election speech that its recent order to the SIT to probe allegations of his involvement in the Gulbarg Society massacre was part of a Congress conspiracy.        
	Riot survivor Jakia Jafri had filed a petition alleging that Modi, his cabinet colleagues and several state police officers aided and abetted the massacre in which her husband, Congress leader Ehsaan Jafri, was one of those killed.        
	In his speech, Modi had implied that since the re-look order followed Congress leader Kapil Sibals statement that the apex court should send him to jail, the court directive to the SIT was part of a Congress conspiracy. Jakia had then filed a contempt petition against the chief minister, which will be heard on Monday.

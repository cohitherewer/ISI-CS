The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Jaswant off panel helm
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Jaswant off panel helm
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Jaswant                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 16: Former BJP leader and Darjeeling MP Jaswant Singh today resigned as the head of Parliaments Public Accounts Committee (PAC), five months before his term in the post ended. Lok Sabha speaker Meira Kumar has accepted his resignation.        
	Singh was expelled on August 19 for being sympathetic to Mohammed Ali Jinnah and critical of Sardar Vallabhai Patel in Jinnah: India-Partition Independence, his book that was released days before the BJPs chintan baithak in Shimla under the RSSs scrutiny. He held Jawaharlal Nehru and Patel culpable for Partition and said Jinnah had been demonised in India.        
	After his expulsion, the BJP had pressured him to quit as the chairman of the parliamentary panel that scrutinises the governments spending. He refused.         
	The government couldnt prevail on him to resign because the issue was seen as an internal party matter. The post of the panels chairman has usually gone to the largest Opposition party since 1964. But while Singh remained a Lok Sabha MP, he ceased to be a BJP member after his expulsion.        
	When the BJP and its allies started boycotting the panels sittings, an embarrassed government felt the situation was becoming untenable. A Congress minister said the government couldnt afford to antagonise the major Opposition party for one individuals sake, more so because the Congress-led UPA was in a minority in the Rajya Sabha and needed to maintain a working relationship with the BJP to get legislations passed. The absence of members of the BJP-led NDA, the minister said, would have undermined the panels credibility.        
	Jaswant Singh was gently advised by whoever mattered in the government to give up the post in the interest of propriety, a parliamentary affairs ministry official said.        
	Singh told reporters he did not quit earlier because he wanted to establish the point that political parties must not be allowed to decide when a member should demit membership of a House panel according to their convenience.        
	The point is about establishing the primacy of autonomy of the parliamentary panels, he said, adding if parties pulled their members out, the committees functioning would be frustrated.        
	He dubbed quit orders from parties as an encroachment on propriety, privilege and prerogative of Parliament, saying tomorrow parties will say write this in your report or dont write this.        
	Asked if the move was meant to buy peace with the BJP and facilitate the way for his return, Singh said: I am surprised and saddened you should see everything in this kind of calculated mode. There is a life beyond calculations, yes in politics too.                           
	On whether his resignation would leave him more time to pursue Gorkhaland, he sounded a bit ambivalent. I was elected with the GJMs staunch support. I am supportive of the Gorkhaland demand but it doesnt mean I support everything they say on Gorkhaland.

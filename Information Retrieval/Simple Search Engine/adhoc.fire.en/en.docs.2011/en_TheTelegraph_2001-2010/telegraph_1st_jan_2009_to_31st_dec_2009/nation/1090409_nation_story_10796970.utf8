The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mountaineers to train glacial scientists
                                                                                                               Mountaineers to train glacial scientists
          G.S. MUDUR                              
	New Delhi, April 8: Skilled mountaineers may soon impart lessons to scientists on climbing through tricky snow and ice zones of the Himalayas in an attempt to hoist Indias glacial research to new heights.         
	The Indian Mountaineering Foundation today inked a pact with The Energy and Resources Institute (Teri) in New Delhi to train Teri scientists pursuing glacial studies in mountaineering skills to work in high-altitude regions.         
	For high-altitude glacial studies, scientists need to learn to climb mountains, walk across thick snow fields, and avoid crevasses, said H.P.S Ahluwalia, president of the foundation. Glaciers above 4,000 metres involve great risk.         
	The foundation will also provide mountaineers to assist scientists during their visits to glaciers.         
	It is hoping the agreement with Teri will serve as a forerunner for similar engagement with other academic institutions involved in glacial research.         
	A proposed Indian-Chinese science expedition to study the sources of the Brahmaputra and the Sutlej rivers in the Tibetan plateau may be among the first research trip where mountaineers will assist scientists, said Ahluwalia, an Indian mountaineer who had scaled Mount Everest in May 1965.         
	He said four Indian and two Chinese scientists were expected to travel to Tibet within a few months to study the sources of the two rivers under an agreement between the foundation and the Chinese Academy of Sciences nearly three years ago.         
	The Indian scientists are likely to be drawn from the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, Dehra Dun. The mountaineering foundation may also assist scientists at Teri in studying glaciers in Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Sikkim.         
	We depend so much on Himalayan glaciers, but we have very scanty research on them, said Rajendra Pachauri, director-general of Teri. We need more studies to understand changes in the glaciers and their likely implications.         
	Syed Iqbal Hussein, a scientist at Teri, said glacial research in India has suffered because of a disconnect between the science community and mountaineers.        
	Mountaineering has never been factored as a prerequisite  so although serious glacial studies began in India more than two decades ago, we still dont even have steady long-term data from even a single, small glacier, Hasnain said.         
	Researchers say the Himalayan glaciers are more challenging than most glaciers in Europe or North America. You can take a train or drive a car to a glacier in the Alps, Hasnain said. But most Himalayan glaciers are very hard to access.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Chidambaram in Jammu. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 4: The home ministry today asserted that P. Chidambaram wasnt present at the Deoband seminary yesterday when the resolution against singing Vande Mataram was passed.        
	The denial came in the form of a ministry rejoinder to BJP vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvis criticism that the minister, who had addressed a Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind conference at Deoband, sat through the session when the organisations 2006 fatwa against Muslims singing the national song was renewed.        
	The rejoinder also said Chidambaram was unaware that such a resolution was planned. P. Chidambaram was at the JUH (Jamiat) conference between 10am and 12 noon. No resolution was passed during that period. When he spoke, he was not aware of any resolution relating to Vande Mataram or womens reservation or cinema and television, the ministry said in its statement.         
	But the row didnt die down. Naqvi today demanded an apology from Chidambaram and said the BJP would raise the matter in Parliaments winter session starting from November 19.        
	The home minister should apologise to the country, he added.        
	The BJP leader picked on the word unaware in the ministry statement to suggest the minister had not taken enough care before going to a sensitive programme. It is unfortunate that a home minister who should have all intelligence inputs before attending a sensitive programme did not know what the agenda was.        
	Chidambaram insisted that he was reading from a prepared text and there was no occasion to depart from that text to suggest he wouldnt have known the agenda.        
	Naqvi also attacked the Jamiat over the fatwa, saying the organisation had insulted the national song.        
	Congress leader Shakeel Ahmed took a cautious line, saying the issue was very sensitive and there should not be any politics and controversy over it.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, July 8: The projects have been conceived, now a unit to monitor their delivery.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has set up a delivery monitoring unit in his office to review and assess the UPA governments flagship programmes like the national rural employment guarantee scheme.         
	The unit will also keep a watch on the Congress-led coalitions iconic projects and initiatives expected to take off within 100 days of the governments formation.        
	The decision to set up the unit follows the Presidents address to both Houses of Parliament last month that was basically a statement of intent.        
	A release by the PMO said the unit would review 18 flagship programmes/initiatives/iconic projects that include the National Rural Health Care Mission, the Universal Literacy Campaign, Bharat Nirman, the Rajiv Housing Scheme, the PMs Reconstruction Plan for Jammu and Kashmir and dedicated railway freight corridors.        
	The Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, National Mission on Female Literacy and the Multi-Sectoral District Plans for Minority Concentration Districts, a follow-up on the Sachar committee recommendations, have been listed, too. The shortlisted schemes also include infrastructure development in the Northeast and the Assam gas cracker project.        
	The cell has been told to ensure effective delivery of the programmes by monitoring outputs generated by the ministries concerned. It has also been told to brief the Prime Minister every four months on the performance of the projects and initiatives, evaluate their impact and disseminate information to ensure transparency and accountability.        
	The PMO made it clear that the unit would be an oversight mechanism and the primary responsibility for implementing the schemes and initiatives would remain with the relevant ministries.        
	The release was silent on how the unit would function and who would head it  it said the details of the format of reporting will be issued separately. But government sources said the mechanism would probably be overseen by Singhs principal secretary, T.K.A. Nair, and PMO officials already working with ministries they have been assigned.

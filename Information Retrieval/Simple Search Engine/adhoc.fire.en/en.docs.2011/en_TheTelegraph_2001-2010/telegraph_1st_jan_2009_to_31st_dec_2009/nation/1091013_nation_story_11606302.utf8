          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 12: There is not enough work for villagers in Orissa.        
	About 8,000 tribal women from 12 districts today took to the streets demanding 100-day work under National Rural Employment Gurantee Scheme (NREGS).         
	Last month they started a road work and we were asked to work for three days. That was all. We have been waiting for work ever since. Officers say there is no work for now, said Labanya Madhei from Khunta block of Mayurbhanj.        
	While observing the International day in defence of indigenous people and earth, the protestors, under the banner of Orissa Nari Samaj, demanded job cards to all BPL families within a month.         
	They also demanded disciplinary action against officers been neglecting duties to ensure work for all.         
	Announcing the formation of a state-level federation of workers, activists demanded compensation for all workers who have not received their rightful job, return of job cards within the next 15 days, work site facilities, social audit and punishment for officials and panchayat members not receiving applications from the beneficiaries.         
	We will defend ourselves and take exploiters and corrupt officials to task if the government is not going to take action and check irregularities, said Janaki Naik, the association president.         
	Over 4,000 village-level unions, 500 panchayat-level unions and 54 block-level unions have been formed in 12 districts. Corrupt officials will be sent petitions, with a copy to the Prime Minister, said Naik, who led a delegation of activists and presented a memorandum of demands before chief minister Naveen Pattnaik today.         
	A community cowshed, grain and seed banks in each village can be set up under the scheme to ensure food security. The shed may be used as a store for organic manure at all villages, suggested H. Alex of Thread, an NGO supporting the cause. Activists also suggested promotion of SRI  Systemic Rice Intensification  soil conservation, pisciculture and duck rearing under the NREG scheme.

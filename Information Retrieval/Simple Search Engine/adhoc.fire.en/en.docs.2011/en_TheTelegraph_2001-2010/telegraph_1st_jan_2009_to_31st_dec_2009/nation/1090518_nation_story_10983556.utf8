                                                                                                               Naveen sets ball rolling
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Naveen Patnaik pays tribute to father Biju Patnaik in Puri on Sunday. (PTI)                                  
	Bhubaneswar, May 17: Biju Janata Dal (BJD) that secured an absolute majority in the Assembly in yesterdays polls has initiated the process of forming a new government in the state. The party won 103 of the 147 Assembly seats.        
	Acting promptly, chief minister Naveen Patnaik today sent in the resignations of his council of ministers in order to facilitate the formation of the new government.        
	On his part, the Orissa Governor, M.C. Bhandare, has accepted the resignations and requested Naveen and his ministerial colleagues to continue in office until alternative arrangements are made, Raj Bhavan sources said.        
	On May 14, the council of ministers, headed by chief minister Naveen Patnaik, had recommended the dissolution of the 13th Assembly, which the governor did. The new Assembly will be constituted following the administering of oath of the newly elected members.        
	Chief minister and BJD boss Naveen Patnaik today visited the Puri Jagannath Temple and later proceeded to hold discussions with senior party leaders, including strategist Pyari Mohan Mohapatra, on the future course of action for his party and the new ministry.         
	BJD sources said the chief minister was likely to meet the Governor in the evening again, or tomorrow, to formally stake his claim to the new government. The election of the BJD legislative leader, a formality, will be held tomorrow.         
	After the governor formally invites Naveen Patnaik to form the new government, the swearing-in of the new ministers will take place. BJD sources believe that the ceremony was likely to be held on Tuesday. Meanwhile, aspirants have started lobbying for ministerial berths.         
	Choosing the ministerial candidates from the 103 elected party legislators will obviously turn out to be a difficult task for the leadership. It would be especially difficult to accommodate the many aspirants to different posts, since the cabinet ceiling is 22, said a senior party leader. The soon-to-be cabinet is expected to be a mix of old-timers, some of who would be re-elected, and young blood, being inducted for the first time.

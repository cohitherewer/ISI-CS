The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lid off list of Metro lapses 
                                                                                                               Lid off list of Metro lapses 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          The crane that overturned a day after the Metro bridge collapse in Delhi                                  
	New Delhi, July 17: The Comptroller and Auditor General of India today said the recent accidents at Delhi Metro project sites might have been avoided had the government not sat on its year-old report that cited lax quality control by the company.        
	The remark will strengthen suspicion that safety and quality were being compromised in the rush to beat the Metros Commonwealth Games deadline next year.        
	The CAG had last year handed the government a performance audit report on the Metros projects of 2006-07, stating the company had compromised on quality to keep its contractors happy. The report has not yet been tabled in Parliament.        
	They (the government) deliberately delayed tabling the report on one pretext or another. There were three sessions of Parliament after we submitted the report, deputy comptroller and auditor general A.N. Chatterjee told a news conference here.        
	He made it clear that had the government tabled the report in time, corrective measures could have been taken and accidents averted.        
	Six people died when an under-construction Metro bridge caved in last Sunday, and five were injured when a crane collapsed while clearing the rubble the next day. Some half-a-dozen accidents at projects sites in the past two years  including bridge collapses and falling beams  have killed at least four people.        
	Chatterjee said: To hasten the project, quality control procedures were relaxed deliberately. If these reports were presented in time, it would have been better as some of it has clear and direct links with what we are witnessing today.        
	He added: Accountability issues should not be placed at unreasonable risk in the interests of expediency.        
	The report said the Metro had scaled down testing requirements; its representatives did not witness tests; and that material was being tested in laboratories that lacked accreditation. It also said that the Metro did not preserve test reports on at least four projects to avoid having to take steps because the projects were already running behind schedule.        
	At this rate, the Metro cannot run for more than 30 years, the report said.        
	The CAG said the Metros unique administrative model  the company is free from government interference  had a flip side too: it created ambiguity in co-ordination and control and made the company immune from legislative accountability.        
	Officials at the CAG office also pointed to departures from norms in the bidding process to choose contractors for projects.        
	The report accused the Metro of acquiring land in excess of project requirements in some areas. The company had acquired 32.38 lakh square metres for Phase I of its extension project but did not maintain location-wise data of land use and property development, it said.        
	The CAG said that in nine locations, the company acquired 6.42 lakh square metres that were in excess of the project requirements by 14 to 354 per cent.        
	Officials of the Metro and the Union urban development ministry, which partly oversees the Metro extension project, refused comment on the ground that the report hadnt been tabled in Parliament yet.

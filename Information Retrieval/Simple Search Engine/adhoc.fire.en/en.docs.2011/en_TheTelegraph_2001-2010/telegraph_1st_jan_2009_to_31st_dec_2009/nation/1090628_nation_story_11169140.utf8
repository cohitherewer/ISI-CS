	Islamabad, June 27 (PTI): Indian death row prisoner Sarabjit Singh, who has been languishing in a Pakistani jail for the last 18 years, has got a new lawyer, days after the supreme court in Islamabad dismissed his appeal against capital punishment.        
	Sarabjits new lawyer Owis Sheikh said he would file a fresh petition in the court.

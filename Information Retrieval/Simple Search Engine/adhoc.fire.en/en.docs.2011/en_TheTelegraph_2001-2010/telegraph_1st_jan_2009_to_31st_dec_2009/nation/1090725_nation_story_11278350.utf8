                                                                                                               Hirakud water poses threat
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, July 24: With excess floodwater continuing to pour in to the state from the Hirakud dam, the administration is now closely monitoring the situation in the delta region of the Mahanadi spread over five districts.         
	Some 27 sluice gates of the Hirakud reservoir near Sambalpur were kept open today, as the Mahanadi crossed the warning level of 25.41m at the head of Naraj delta and flowed at 25.94m (against the danger-level of 26.41m) with a flow of nearly 7.5 lakh cusecs at Cuttack.         
	Hirakud reservoir, built on the Mahanadi, was receiving 236,967 cusecs of water, while the outflow was around 452,375 cusecs. The water level at Hirakud stood at 620.08ft, against a maximum capacity of 630ft, with nearly 63.5 per cent of the live storage capacity filled up.         
	Latest recordings indicated a water flow of around 576,000 cusecs at Khairamal and 710,500 cusecs at Barmul, while it was over 742,631 cusecs further down at Mundali before Naraj.         
	Water resources department officials conceded that if the Naraj delta head received water up to 9 lakh cusecs or more, there was the possibility of low-lying areas getting inundated downstream.         
	The next 24 hours will require close monitoring as the floodwater released from Hirakud on Thursday will reach the delta head tonight, the official said.         
	The Hirakud floodwater was let out starting from total outflow of 510,696 cusecs and stepped up to 511,950 cusecs in three hours. The discharge went up to 534,675 cusecs by noon, as inflow increased to 556,770 cusecs through 33 sluice gates.         
	Irrigation authorities had maintained 0.88ft as the flood gap with reservoir level at 622.12ft, against a maximum of 630ft.         
	The Mahanadi delta region has a network of 3,924km of river embankments comprising Mahanadi, Luna, Chitrotpala, Kathajodi, Daya, Bhargavi, Kushabhadra and Devi spread over Cuttack, Kendrapada, Jagatsinghpur, Puri, Khurda and Nayagarh in coastal Orissa.

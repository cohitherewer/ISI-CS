The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP to take grouse to Patil
                                                                                                               BJP to take grouse to Patil
                            
	New Delhi, July 27: The BJP leadership has decided to submit a memorandum to President Pratibha Patil complaining against a host of steps taken by the UPA government which the party thinks will hurt Indias long-term interests.         
	 The memorandum, which all the NDA MPs will submit to Patil at Rashtrapati Bhavan tomorrow, will mention the Indo-Pak joint statement recently adopted in Egypt that de-links action on terrorism from the composite dialogue. The other issues it will cite are the G8 resolution on enrichment technology, climate change restrictions and the end-use monitoring pact with the US.

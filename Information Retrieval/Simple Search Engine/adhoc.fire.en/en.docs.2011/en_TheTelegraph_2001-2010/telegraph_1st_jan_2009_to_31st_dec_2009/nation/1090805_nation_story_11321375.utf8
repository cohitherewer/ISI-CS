	Patna, Aug. 4 (PTI): Chief Minister Nitish Kumar today said that he had asked a panel comprising Tirhut divisional commissioner S.M. Raju and deputy inspector-general of Tirhut range V. Srinivasan to go into the reasons leading to the breach in the embankment of the Bagmati and submit an inquiry report at the earliest.        
	The high-level probe panel would apart from meeting the officials of Sitamarhi and Muzaffarpur districts also try to gauge peoples view on the reasons that lead to the breach, Nitish said.        
	He directed the authorities in Sitamarhi and Muzaffarpur districts to provide compensation package for the displaced persons on the pattern of the one made available to flood-hit victims in the Kosi belt last year.        
	Special arrangements have been made for around 8,000 flood-hit victims who were rendered homeless and taking shelter on the embankments of the Bagmati and Lakhandei, sources said, adding all those inundated by floods have been evacuated to safer places.        
	According to central water commission, the Bagmati will see a receding trend in the next 24 hours.

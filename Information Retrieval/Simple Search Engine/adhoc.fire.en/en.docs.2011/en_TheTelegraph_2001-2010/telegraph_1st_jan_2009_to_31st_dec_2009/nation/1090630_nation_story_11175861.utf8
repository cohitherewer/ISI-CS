          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 29: Everyday features such as buses, trains and traffic snarls came into focus as Jaipal Reddy unveiled his urban development ministrys 100-day agenda today.        
	Unlike some of his peers, Reddy looked to strengthen existing programmes rather than launch new ones, seeking an extra Rs 50,000 crore to bring 28 more cities under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission.        
	The mission now involves 65 cities with a population of over 10 lakh each; the ministry wants to include cities with populations between 5 lakh and 10 lakh.        
	The government has committed Rs 100,000 crore. However, we feel we will require Rs 50,000 crore more to include 28 more cities, Reddy said.        
	The bulk of the agenda concerns public transport, cheap houses for the poor and slum dwellers, and strengthening of Delhis sports infrastructure ahead of the 2010 Commonwealth Games.        
	For the first time, substantial assistance has been made for the purchase of 15,220 modern buses for 61 mission cities. These buses will be delivered by December 2009, Reddy said.        
	The agenda also looks to develop the Metro railway in Calcutta, Bangalore, Mumbai and Chennai, and to connect Noida and Gurgaon to the Delhi Metro.        
	Excellence centres        
	Work has started on the 13 centres of excellence to be opened in the IITs, IIMs and other institutions of national importance, Reddy announced.        
	The centres will focus on urban transport and urban affairs and the ministry will provide financial assistance for this, Reddy said.

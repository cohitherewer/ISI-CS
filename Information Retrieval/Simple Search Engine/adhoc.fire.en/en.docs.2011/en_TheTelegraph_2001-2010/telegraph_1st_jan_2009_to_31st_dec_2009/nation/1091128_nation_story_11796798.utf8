The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Panel seeks age review 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Panel seeks age review 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 27: A key Parliament panel has criticised the governments decision to raise the retirement age of teachers at central higher education institutions from 62 to 65, saying this will kill opportunities for young aspirants.         
	The parliament standing committee on human resource development has asked the HRD ministry to review its decision to raise the retirement age, rejecting its argument that it will help combat faculty shortage.         
	In a report tabled yesterday in Parliament, the panel, headed by Congress leader Oscar Fernandes, argued that ageing teachers may not be able to adopt teaching techniques needed today. These teachers perhaps would not be in a position to introduce innovative ways of teaching tuned to the changing times, the report said.         
	The panels report argues that instead of raising the retirement age, the government should focus on motivating the youth to take up teaching and on making the profession more attractive.         
	Reports of Parliament standing committees are recommendatory in nature but the government rarely defies the proposals of the panels.         
	 The HRD ministry will be required to explain what action it takes on the panels recommendation to review the retirement age hike, when the standing committee meets next.         
	The ministry in March 2008 issued orders raising the retirement age of faculty at all central higher education institutions from 62 to 65. This included central universities and institutions like the IITs, IIMs and the National Institutes of Technology.

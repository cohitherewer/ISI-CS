                                                                                                               BJD member joins Opp cry
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, July 20: To the embarrassment of the ruling bench, a senior BJD member today joined an Opposition attack on the Naveen Patnaik government for its failure to plug breaches on river embankments.        
	Ridiculing government claims about completion of the repair, senior BJD member Pradip Maharathy alleged that the work at Phulapal and Teisipur, in his Assembly constituency, was inadequate.         
	Contractors in connivance with staff of water resources department have looted the state exchequer and left the areas vulnerable this year again, charged the BJD legislator from Pipili. He demanded a probe into the scam and stringent actions against unscrupulous contractors and staff. During last years flood, as many as 512 breaches had been caused on major river embankments across 15 districts. The government claims that 508 breaches have been plugged so far.         
	The claims are false and ridiculous, said Opposition whip Prasad Harichandan, who set the tone for the Opposition attack. The government itself is providing contradictory figures. In a reply to one question, the government has claimed that 508 breaches have been closed, in another it quoted the figure as 492, he said. Harichandan represents Kanas and Satyabadi areas.         
	Responding on behalf of the chief minister, parliamentary affairs minister, Raghunath Mohanty reiterated the governments claim.         
	He added that the water resources department had spent Rs 97 crore on the repairs as against a budgetary provision of Rs 70 crore and release of funds to the tune of Rs 61 crore for this purpose.         
	This year, 702 vulnerable points and 37 very vulnerable points on major embankments were identified, said Mohanty, adding that departmental engineers and officials were keeping a close vigil on the places.

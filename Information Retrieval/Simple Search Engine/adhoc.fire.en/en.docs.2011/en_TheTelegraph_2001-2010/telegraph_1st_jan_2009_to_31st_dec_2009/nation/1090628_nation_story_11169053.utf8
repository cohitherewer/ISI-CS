          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Imphal, June 27: An award-winning Manipuri film actress was arrested with a senior militant leader from a New Delhi guesthouse last evening, police said today.        
	Devita Devi, one of Manipurs biggest movie stars, was nabbed with R.K. Raghunath alias Nongsaba of the Kanglei Yawol Kanna Lup (KYKL), a police source said.        
	They were found in room No. 204 at Sheeshmahal Guest House in Delhis South Extension area, he added. Nongsabas precise rank in the KYKL is not yet clear.        
	Devi has acted in more than 30 Manipuri films. Last year, she won the best actresss award for her role in Lakhipurgee Lakhipyari (Lakhipyari of Lakhipur) at the Festival of Manipuri Cinema. The film swept 11 of the 24 prizes.        
	Sources said Nongsaba and Devi had been staying at the guesthouse for the past week. The actress, who is from Moirang in Manipurs Bishnupur district, had left Imphal for Delhi a week ago to ostensibly meet a relative, other sources said.        
	Bishnupur superintendent of police K. Jayenta Singh, speaking over the phone, would only say: There has been some development but we are not in a position to reveal much.        
	A Manipur police team that had arrived in Delhi a few days ago made the arrests with the help of Delhi police. Unconfirmed reports said two more persons were picked up.        
	Another team of police commandos from Bishnupur left for Delhi today to help the first team in the investigations and bring the two accused back to Manipur.        
	It might take a couple of days to bring them back because we will have to apply for transit remand and finish other formalities, a police source said.        
	This is the second time this year that Manipur police have arrested militants in Delhi. On January 17, the force had arrested four senior militants of the Kangleipak Communist Party (KCP) in the capital. Three days later, they carried out a raid in Bangalore, nabbing two other KCP activists.        
	In March, the police arrested two activists of the Peoples United Liberation Army in Mumbai.        
	Earlier this month, a joint raid by Assam and Karnataka police had netted the chairman of the Dima Halam Daogah (Jewel), Jewel Gorlosa, from Bangalore with two alleged accomplices.

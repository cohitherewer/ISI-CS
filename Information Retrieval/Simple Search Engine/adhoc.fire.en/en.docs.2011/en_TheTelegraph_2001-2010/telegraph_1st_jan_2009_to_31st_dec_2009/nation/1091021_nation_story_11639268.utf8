	New Delhi, Oct. 20: The Supreme Court today decided to await the outcome of a judicial probe into the death of a key accused-cum-witness in the provident fund scam, rejecting a plea for an immediate CBI or independent investigation.        
	Ashutosh Asthana had died under mysterious circumstances in Ghaziabad jail on Saturday. The magistrate will submit his report to the court within eight weeks.        
	Lets have faith in some judicial officer, if not all. Lets first have a probe under the CrPC. If we are not satisfied, we will see later, said Justice D.K. Jain, who heads the special bench on the scam.        
	The court, however, directed jail officials to hand over Asthanas viscera to the CBI for tests at AIIMS.

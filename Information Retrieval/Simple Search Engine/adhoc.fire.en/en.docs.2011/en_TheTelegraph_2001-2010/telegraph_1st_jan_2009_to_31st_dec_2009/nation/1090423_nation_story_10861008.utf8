The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Coast readies for final lap
                                                                                                               Coast readies for final lap
          OUR BUREAU                               
	Bhubaneswar, April 22: On the eve of second round of polling in Orissa, the ruling BJD and Opposition Congress are busy making last-ditch efforts to capture power.        
	Tomorrows polling assumes significance, as voters of a more politically conscious coastal belt are ready to place their verdict for more than half of the total 21 Lok Sabha and 147 Assembly seats.         
	During the past two Assembly and three Lok Sabha polls, BJD won a number of the seats in Balasore, Bhadrak, Jajpur, Kendrapara, Jagatsighpur, Cuttack, Puri, Khurda and Nayagarh (25 out of 54 in 2004 Assembly polls) with backing from its former ally BJP.         
	It also bagged seven of the eight Lok Sabha seats located in the belt, while the rest was won by BJP.         
	Now, BJD is facing a tough triangular fight with Congress and BJP after the break of the 11-year alliance. In many seats, the friend-turned-foe has fielded rebel BJD candidates, like sitting MPs Braja Kishore Tripathy and Archana Nayak.        
	And BJP seems determined as a party leader, on condition of anonymity, said: We may not win so many seats, but we will ensure BJDs defeat.         
	Congress, which claims to have fared well in the first phase of polls in southern and western Orissa, is hopeful of improving its tally, taking advantage of the split. During the 2004 polls, Congress had won nine Assembly seats in coastal belt.         
	Leaders of the above three parties have been intensely campaigning in the coastal belt braving the mercury as it hovered above 42 degree Celsius.         
	The belt witnessed high voltage campaigns led by Congresss Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, BJPs L.K. Advani, Narendra Modi and Raman Singh and NCP boss Sharad Pawar.         
	BJDs sole star campaigner, chief minister, Naveen Patnaik, on the other hand, made it a point to touch each and every assembly segment.         
	Naveen Patnaiks BJD appears to have a distinct edge in at least four of the seven Assembly seats under the Cuttack Lok Sabha constituency in the second phase.        
	 An electorate of more than 1.45 crore will decide the fate of 85 candidates contesting for the 11 Lok Sabha seats and 688 Assembly candidates tomorrow.

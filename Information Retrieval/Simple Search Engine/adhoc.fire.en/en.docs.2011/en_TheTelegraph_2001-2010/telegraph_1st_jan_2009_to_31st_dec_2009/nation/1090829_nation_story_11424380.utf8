The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Maya police told to be polite 
                                                                                                               Maya police told to be polite 
          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                    Mayavati                          
	Lucknow, Aug. 28: When an Uttar Pradesh cop calls someone bhagwan ki aulad (son of god) or Harijan, not many would be surprised.        
	Now, however, that might change. Mayavati has moved to make the states police stations better places by asking the poorly behaved force to tone up their etiquette, especially when dealing with lower castes, women and children.        
	State police chief Vikram Singh has sent out elaborate instructions asking officers not to use abusive language.        
	The move came after Mayavati  herself a Dalit and into her fourth stint as chief minister  last week summoned Singh and expressed shock over the series of atrocities against backward castes.        
	She is also said to have told him that she was appalled by the way suspects and those who came to lodge complaints were treated.         
	The chief ministers rebuke followed complaints from rights bodies, including one from the New York-based Human Rights Watch in July that quoted a number of victims of the abuses.         
	The National Human Rights Organisation had also written to the government in May pointing out that it had received highest number of complaints from Uttar Pradesh.        
	DGP Singhs reaction was swift. Indecent manners of a policeman at the police station and use of harsh and abusive language downgrade the image of the department, he said after issuing the instructions.        
	But the police chief is confronting an old enemy. For years now, his force has got used to hurling words like bhagwan ki aulad  proscribed under the SC/ST Act  and the obviously offensive ganda gali ka kutta (a dog from a dirty lane) at Dalits.        
	A retired officer summed up the situation. Even after 32 years of my service, I dont feel like visiting a police station in Uttar Pradesh, said former inspector-general S.R. Darapuri.        
	He pointed out that having a Dalit as chief minister hadnt stopped the force from insulting lower castes. Even under Mayavati, a woman is called chamarin (someone who makes and repairs shoes and leather items).        
	Darapuri said police stations often turned out to be hellish for rape victims. Thana-level officers often ask a rape victim to count how many times she was raped and why she had allowed a man to rape her repeatedly, he said.         
	It was common, he added, for low-caste victims to be addressed as Tu and Teri instead of the genteel Aap.        
	Rights activists have claimed that any trip to a police station in the state doesnt pass without having to hear gender and caste slurs.        
	They also point to the discrimination: well-dressed visitors are greeted with respect and asked to sit on chair, the poor and backward castes are made to sit on the floor as they wait to file FIRs.        
	Now, DGP Singh wants that to end. In his instructions, he has also asked officers not to arrest the elderly and children under the Goonda Act, invoked in some districts.         
	But the Opposition has dismissed Mayavatis politeness diktat as a political gimmick. Leader of Opposition, the Samajwadi Partys Shivpal Singh Yadav, said the chief minister doesnt have patience to carry out reforms.

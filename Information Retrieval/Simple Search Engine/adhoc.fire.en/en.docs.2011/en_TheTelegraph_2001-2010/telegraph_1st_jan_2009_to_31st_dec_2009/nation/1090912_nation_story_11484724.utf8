	Jaipur, Sept. 11: Lalit Modi, the IPL commissioner, has been accused of disrespecting the Tricolour during an India-Pakistan ODI two years ago.        
	Nagrik Morcha, a non-government organisation, had lodged a police complaint, saying some foreign guests of the cricket official had used the flag as a table cover and kept liquor glasses over it during the match on November 18, 2007.         
	The NGO said since the guests were seated in the VIP lounge of the Sawai Man Singh Stadium, they were invitees of Modi, then president of the Rajasthan Cricket Association that organised the match.        
	India lost the match.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | LJPs Paswan-Yadav rift widens Nitish smile
                                                                                                               LJPs Paswan-Yadav rift widens Nitish smile
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Nitish Kumar: Smart poll moves                                  
	Patna, Feb. 26: Ram Vilas Paswan faces a revolt-like situation in his LJP, with party vice-president and parliamentary board chairman Ranjan Yadav deciding to sever ties with the party after Paswan moved to strike an electoral alliance with the RJD.         
	I will not be a party to the friendship with Lalu Prasad. He is a leader who has gone behind bars six times for the fodder scam and who, with Rabri Devi, created a jungle rule in the state, said Ranjan Yadav in a letter to Paswan.         
	Ranjan Yadav  a man elected as MP four times and a once bosom friend of Lalu Prasad for three decades  has cited instances when Paswan would describe the railway minister as a wound, a back-stabber and an enemy of development in his speeches before cadre and people.         
	This development should be sweet music to the ears of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar who is hoping to induct Ranjan Yadav in the JD(U) and field him against Lalu Prasad, if the latter opts to contest from the Pataliputra seat, besides Saran.         
	With a relaxed smile, Nitish Kumar said: Ranjan Yadavs revolt against his leadership is justified. He (Ranjan) has been opposing the move to have any tie between Lalu Prasad and his party.         
	The chief minister again smiled when asked if he would induct Ranjan in the JD(U). I am not supposed to answer obvious queries, he said.         
	Sources close to Ranjan Yadav revealed that he would soon organise a congregation of the Yadavs in Patna to demonstrate his clout and expose Lalu Prasad.         
	Observers believe that Ranjans move will help Nitish and his politics before the Lok Sabha polls.         
	In fact, Nitish Kumar has been working out to find candidates against UPA stalwarts in Bihar.         
	By inducting the socialist veteran and former chief minister Ram Sunder Das in JD(U), the party boss and states chief minister Nitish got a powerful candidate to field against Ram Vilas Paswan on the Hajipur seat.         
	Now, Ranjan Yadavs revolt is set to give Nitish a candidate in form of Lalu Prasads Man Friday to pit against Lalu Prasad.         
	Nitish knows the art of defeating the enemy with the latters weapons quite well, said a supporter.        
	Grapevine has it that Lalu Prasad has been making up his mind to contest the Pataliputra seat besides Saran in the coming polls. Pataliputra  a new constituency created by the delimitation commission  is dominated by the rural areas mostly comprising Yadavs, Muslims and dalits.         
	Nitish Kumar will obviously like an Yadav as the NDA nominee to contest against Lalu Prasad.         
	And who will be better than Ranjan Yadav who knows Lalu Prasad? asked a senior JD U leader, adding that: If it happens then Nitish has got a formidable opponent against Lalu, at least, on the Pataliputra seat.         
	Ranjan Yadav was the second in command in RJD till 2004 when he fell apart with Lalu Prasad to join hands with Paswan in his endeavour to liberate Bihar from Lalu-Rabri jungle raaj.        
	But the development proves the adage politics makes strange bedfellows true for Paswan and Lalu Prasad  UPA stalwarts  burying their hatchet in a battle against the BJP-led NDA.

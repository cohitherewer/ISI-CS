          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, April 19: The personal secretary of the Andhra Pradesh health minister has been caught on camera having sex with a contract nurse in the ministers chambers, according to a DVD doing the rounds.        
	Police said the scandal in the middle of elections had left minister Sambani Chandrasekhar dumbfounded and embarrassed, more so because the alleged sexual exploits took place right under his nose, and very near to the office of the home minister.        
	Only recently the minister was made aware of the fact and he was dumbfounded, a police official said. Sources said the minister was hauled up by chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy. The chief secretary has ordered a probe.        
	The DVD shows personal secretary Giri Raos activities with the nurse who the police said was seeking regularisation of service. Sources close to Chandrasekhar said Rao, now arrested, had been appointed a few months back after the earlier secretary retired.

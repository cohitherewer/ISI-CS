The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Spoiler on Scindias turf
                                                                                                               Spoiler on Scindias turf
          RASHEED KIDWAI                              Scindia (top), Laxman: Eyeball to eyeball				                                 
	Bhopal, March 1: The maharaja has to wait till summer to find out if a Laxman rekha exists for him too on his own turf.        
	Bhopals political circles are agog with the prospect of a contest between Jyotiraditya Scindia and former Congress chief minister Digvijay Singhs brother Laxman in Guna, which has been with the 38-year-old royal scion since he won a bypoll after his father Madhavrao Scindias death.        
	Laxman, 54, a four-time BJP Lok Sabha MP from adjoining Rajgarh, has reportedly expressed a desire to take on the maharaja of Gwalior.        
	The possibility of a showdown between the two in the Lok Sabha polls has intensified divisions in the Madhya Pradesh Congress, particularly the rivalry among supporters of Jyotiraditya and Digvijay, though the AICC general secretary has distanced himself from his younger brother.        
	Jyotiraditya had won by over 4 lakh votes in the 2002 bypoll but, in 2004, his victory margin had dwindled to just over 70,000.        
	This time, those opposed to Jyotiraditya said, Laxmans presence in Guna could act as a spoiler as local chieftains wield considerable influence. Moreover, delimitation has meant redrawing the maps of both Guna and Rajgarh.        
	Jyotiraditya was in Bhopal recently in connection with a government event. Asked about infighting in the state Congress, he said unity was not something that could be achieved by the mere presence of leaders on a platform. It has to come from the heart and be shown in action, he said.         
	Digvijay cut in, asking the younger leader to first bring about unity among Congress cadre in the Gwalior region. The AICC general secretary said he would be too happy to support Jyotiraditya if the maharaja managed to unite party workers in Bhind, Morena, Shivpuri, Guna and Gwalior.        
	The verbal scrap stunned state Congress leaders who feared a more intense and nothing-to-live-for battle during the April-May Lok Sabha polls.         
	The Arjun Singh camp, too, is polarised over the likely candidature from Satna of Veena, the daughter of the Union HRD minister. While Digvijay and Union minister Kamal Nath support Veena, Arjuns politician son Ajay has reservations.        
	Party sources said Ajay, a four-time MLA, had been questioning how a rookie like his sister could be considered for a Lok Sabha seat.

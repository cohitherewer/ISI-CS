The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Note racket traced to Bangladesh
                                                                                                               Note racket traced to Bangladesh
          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, Sept. 10: Probe into a currency racket has led state police to Malda in Bengal and, finally, to Bangladesh.        
	On Tuesday night, Raipur police arrested one Bhor Jahan, a resident of Malda (Bengal), for trying to circulate fake notes worth Rs 2.09 lakh in the local markets. His Bangladeshi accomplice, however, managed to give police the slip.Police interrogated Jahan yesterday and received information about a possible Bengal-Bangladesh corridor being used to circulate fake notes in the Indian market.        
	Based on what Jahan told us, we have evidence to establish that agents are mainly operating from Bangladesh and Bengal, said Amit Kumar, Raipur superintendent of police, to The Telegraph. A Raipur police team left for Malda, 8km from Bangladesh border, on Tuesday.         
	Jahan, in his early twenties, said that the Bangladeshi national (whose identity has not been disclosed) was a frequent visitor to Malda. The young man accompanied this man to Raipur on August 19 from Howrah by train looking for a job.         
	The duo stayed at a hotel near the station, where the Bangladeshi national asked Jahan to circulate 10 fake currencies of Rs 1,000 in the local market. The young man was asked to return eight notes of Rs 100 each against one fake note worth Rs 1,000. Jahan was paid Rs 200 daily for his job.        
	Jahan circulated the money among vegetable vendors.         
	He bought vegetables with the fake notes and got the balance in real money, said an investigating officer. The young man later disposed the fresh vegetables in the dustbin. The duo returned to Malda, where Jahan stayed back, while his accomplice travelled to Bangladesh, only to be back with fresh bundles of money. They went to Raipur again on Tuesday.         
	Officers from the Central Bureau of Investigation and National Investigating Agency are likely to visit Raipur, he added.

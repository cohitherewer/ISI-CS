The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nobel punch at hunger strike teachers   Sibal says no to IIT pay hike
                                                                                                               Nobel punch at hunger strike teachers 
  Sibal says no to IIT pay hike          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                   
	New Delhi, Sept. 22: An aggressive Kapil Sibal today rejected demands for better salaries by IIT faculty in a point-by-point rebuttal that suggested he was unwilling to bow to sustained pressure.        
	The HRD minister argued that the protests by the faculty were inappropriate for teachers at some of Indias best higher education institutions, and claimed the government had already conceded legitimate demands.        
	We want the faculty to produce future Nobel laureates, not spend their time on hunger strikes, Sibal said.        
	He said he was willing to meet the faculty to discuss any concern but indicated that the teachers should first call off a hunger strike planned for September 24.        
	The minister and the higher education secretary conceded that they might need to revisit a controversial recruitment rule that could bar the IITs and the IIMs from hiring as professors some of the worlds brightest minds.         
	Under the new rule, only those who have taught for four years as associate professors at a select band of Indian institutes are eligible for professor posts.        
	We will change this (rule) if necessary. I can assure the IITs that no one from an institute on a par or better than them will be barred from joining as professors, said Sibal, rejecting allegations that the ministry was trying to curb the autonomy of the IITs and IIMs.        
	I have always believed in promoting merit. Ever since I became minister, no one from my ministry has ever called an IIT or IIM and made any demand, he said.        
	But apart from the controversial rule, Sibal rejected every demand made by the IIT and IIM faculty.        
	The faculty have demanded that fresh PhDs be allowed to join directly as permanent teachers. The pay regime notified by the ministry on August 18 mandated that new teachers be hired on contract.         
	Contract jobs, the faculty argued, will prove unattractive in hiring young PhDs, also on the radar of recruiters at industrial firms. But Sibal argued the best higher education institutions across the world followed similar recruitment policies  hiring fresh teachers on a contractual tenure basis and granting them a permanent job after they had gathered some experience.         
	The faculty have demanded that the ministry lift a 40 per cent cap  placed under the new pay regime notified on August 18  on the number of professors eligible for a higher salary grade. The cap, they argue, could slow the promotion of young professors and lead to nepotism. (See chart).        
	But the minister used a set of statistics to buttress his argument against what he called an unjustified demand. The UGCs new pay rules place a 10 per cent cap on professors at central universities eligible for the higher pay grade. A similar 20 per cent cap has been placed for professors at the National Institutes of Technology.         
	Sibal said the ministry had actually raised the cap for IITs and IIMs beyond what was proposed by a central pay panel. The panel had restricted the higher pay grade to 3 per cent of the total faculty  a number that works out to 6 per cent for professors, who typically constitute half the faculty.        
	The ministers reference to the Mehta panel is significant because the ministry has drawn criticism from IIT and IIM faculty for snipping most other pay recommendations, including increments proposed by the panel.        
	A requirement that a minimum 10 per cent of all faculty be fresh PhDs hired on contract was introduced to effectively reserve faculty posts for such doctoral graduates, Sibal said.

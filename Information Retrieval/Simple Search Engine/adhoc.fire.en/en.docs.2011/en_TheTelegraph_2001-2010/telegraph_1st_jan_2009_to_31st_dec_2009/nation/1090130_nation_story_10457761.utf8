	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 29: The Orissa CID today filed a chargesheet against 10 accused in the Kandhamal nun rape case.         
	A 29-year-old nun was allegedly raped on August 25, 2008, during the communal violence in Kandhamal that followed the murder of a VHP swami two days earlier.         
	Inspector-general of police, crime branch, Arun Roy said the chargesheet was filed in the court of the subdivisional judicial magistrate at Baliguda in the district within the stipulated 120 days of the first arrest. Four persons were arrested on October 2.         
	The crime branch is likely to submit a petition for issue of arrest warrants against another 50 people, identified to be part of the mob that assaulted the nun, Roy said.         
	We will file a supplementary chargesheet after their arrest, said investigating officer Dillip Kumar Mohanty.         
	Jhuria Pradhan and his son Kartik, Saroj Bhadei and his son Muna, brothers Tapas Patnaik and Santosh alias Mitu Patnaik, and Biren Sahu, Somnath Pradhan, Gajendra Digal and Jharalal Behera were the 10 charged today.

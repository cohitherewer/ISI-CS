                                                                                                               Vote for India rebuff to China

	Namsai/Mechukha, Oct. 13: The day China cried foul, people flocked in droves to polling booths in Arunachal Pradesh, clocking a 74 per cent turnout.        
	Digyi, a voter, spent a week travelling from Mussoorie to hometown Mechukha, around 530km from Arunachal capital Itanagar, to exercise her franchise.         
	Seng Singpho reached home in nearby Miao from another part of Arunachal in 30 hours, including a boat ride on the Brahmaputra near Dibrugarh in neighbouring Assam.        
	Digyi will suffer a loss in her garments business near Mussoorie. Seng will be unable to distribute air-dropped food packets to officials near Manigong on the India-China border, where he is posted as an Arunachal government employee.        
	But both felt that the journey was worth it. Voting to karna padega na, har baar jaisa (like every election, one has to vote), said Digyi, trekking 2km of mountainous road as the vehicle she was travelling in broke down on way to Mechukha from Itanagar.        
	Asked about the outrage in Beijing, Seng laughed: Kya China, China, this is India yaar.        
	Octogenarian Yape Komi remembers the day Chinese troops trapped Indian soldiers between Mechukha and Tato on the banks of the Yargetchu. Their soldiers were good to us as they took shelter in our homes, but we were ignorant then. Not any more, I wont allow them in again, Komi said in native tongue Bokar through an interpreter.         
	There is little rhetoric or jingoism among the Arunachalese  they consider it silly to assume they are anything but Indians. All this despite Delhis neglect of the regions development for more than six decades.         
	Vote for India, giggled septuagenarian Yejap Ridda, combing her hair to pose for a photograph with her sister. Yejap was newly married in 1962 when Chinese troops occupied her husbands village Tato for a week. Since then, it has been peaceful.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lashkar threat from Pak persists 
                                                                                                               Lashkar threat from Pak persists 
  - Defence officials warn of 26/11-style attacks as militant network endures         LYDIA POLGREEN AND SOUAD MEKHENNET                                    
	Karachi, Sept. 30: Ten months after the devastating attacks in Mumbai by Pakistan-based militants, the group behind the assault remains largely intact and determined to strike India again, according to current and former members of the group, Lashkar-e-Toiba, and intelligence officials.        
	Despite pledges from Pakistan to dismantle militant groups operating on its soil, and the arrest of a handful of operatives, Lashkar has persisted, even flourished, since 10 recruits killed over 180 people in a rampage through Mumbai last November.        
	Indian and Pakistani dossiers on the Mumbai investigations, copies of which were obtained by The New York Times, offer a detailed picture of the operations of a Lashkar network that spans Pakistan. It included four houses and two training camps in this sprawling southern port city that were used to prepare the attacks.        
	Among the organisers, the Pakistani document says, was Hammad Amin Sadiq, a homeopathic pharmacist, who arranged bank accounts and secured supplies. He and six others begin their formal trial on Saturday in Pakistan, though Indian authorities say the prosecution stops well short of top Lashkar leaders.        
	Indeed, Lashkars broader network endures, and can be mobilised quickly for elaborate attacks with relatively few resources, according to a dozen current and former Lashkar militants and intelligence officials from the US, Europe, India and Pakistan.        
	In interviews with The Times, they presented a troubling portrait of Lashkars capabilities, its popularity in Pakistan and the support it has received from former officials of Pakistans military and intelligence establishment.        
	Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence directorate, or ISI, helped create Lashkar two decades ago to challenge Indian control in Kashmir.         
	Pakistani officials say that after September 11, 2001, they broke their contacts with the group. No credible evidence has emerged of Pakistani government involvement in the Mumbai attacks, according to a US law enforcement official.        
	But a senior American intelligence official said the ISI was believed to maintain ties with Lashkar. Four Lashkar members, interviewed individually, said only a thin distance separated Lashkar and the ISI, bridged by former ISI and military officials.        
	Some people of the ISI knew about the plan and closed their eyes, said one senior Lashkar operative in Karachi who said he had met some of the gunmen before they left for the Mumbai assault.        
	By all accounts Lashkars network, though dormant, remains alive, and the possibility that it could strike India again makes Lashkar a wild card in one of the most volatile regions of the world.        
	The dossiers show that at the level of the police, the two countries can cooperate, and have exchanged DNA evidence, photographs and items found with the attackers to piece together a detailed portrait of the Mumbai plot.        
	But the files are laced with barbs and recriminations, reflecting the increasingly acid tenor of their relations. Despite pledges to work together to fight terrorism, the Pakistani and Indian intelligence services are not on speaking terms, according to officials in both countries and the US.        
	The gaps heighten the risks of a new attack substantially, American officials fear.        
	The only cooperation we have with the Pakistanis is that they send us their terrorists, who kill our people, and we kill their terrorists, a senior Indian intelligence official said in an interview.        
	Asked how much his agency communicated with its Indian counterpart, a senior Pakistani intelligence official made an with his thumb and forefinger.        
	Zero, he replied.        
	The Pakistani investigation concludes beyond any reasonable doubt that it was Lashkar militants who carried out the Mumbai attacks.        
	According to testimony by the only surviving attacker, Ajmal Kasab, Lashkar recruits were vetted and trained around the country.        
	Working from Millat Town, a dusty, middle-class Karachi suburb on the eastern edge of the city, Sadiq organised the cadre. The Pakistani dossier says he was a committed Lashkar militant.        
	In an interview, his uncle, Lala Yasin, said the same thing, adding proudly that Sadiq was willing to do anything to liberate Kashmir from Indias grip. Lashkar-e-Toiba does not kill people without reason, Yasin said.        
	Pakistani authorities have arrested seven men linked to the Mumbai attacks, including Sadiq and Zaki ur-Rehman Lakhvi, a man known as the chief of operations for Lashkar. They are searching for at least 13 other suspects.        
	But their probe has come up short of the founder of Lashkar, Hafiz Saeed, the man accused of masterminding the attacks. Under continuing pressure, Pakistani authorities this month confined his movements. But they say they have no new evidence against him.        
	Indian officials say they have sent Pakistan a six-page summary of evidence of Saeeds complicity in the Mumbai attacks. One Hindustani boat has to be hijacked for going to Bombay from Karachi, the document says. Saeed also told the group it should aim to begin the assault around 7.30 pm.        
	At this hour there is considerable crowd at the places of our target, the document quotes him as saying.        
	Pakistani officials and legal experts say the evidence is not as clear-cut as India says. The case against Saeed rests almost entirely on the testimony of Kasab, and questions remain about the way the Indian police obtained his statements, they say.        
	Even as new details emerge about the Mumbai attacks, senior American military, intelligence and counter-terrorism officials express grim certainty that Lashkar is plotting new attacks.        
	The US warned Indian officials this year about a Mumbai-style attack by Lashkar against multiple sites in India, according to a senior defence department official and a senior American counter-terrorism official. Pakistani officials, however, say they have been kept in the dark.

	Kasab confession   
	Ajmal Kasab, the lone surviving 26/11 attacker, voluntarily confessed to his crime because he wanted others to derive inspiration from his action, the magistrate who recorded his confession said on Wednesday.   
	Additional chief metropolitan magistrate Rama Vijay Sawant Vagule told the special court conducting the Mumbai attack trial that Kasab had expressed his desire to confess when he was produced before her on February 17. He was given 24 hours to reconsider his decision.   
	On February 18, when Kasab was again produced before me, he reiterated his desire to confess. He showed no remorse for his crime and told me that he wanted to confess so that others may derive inspiration from his action, Vagule told the court.  
	The magistrate was examined as a witness because Kasab had later retracted his confession, saying that he had given it under duress.

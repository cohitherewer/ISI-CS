The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Aarushi report
                                                                                                               Aarushi report
                            
	New Delhi, July 7 (PTI): The Centre today told the Supreme Court that it would submit a status report on the progress of the Aarushi Talwar murder case.         
	Solicitor-general Gopal Subramaniam gave the assurance after a bench asked about the cases progress while hearing a PIL seeking a series of directions in the case.        
	Aarushi, the teenage daughter of a dentist couple, was found with her throat slit in her Noida home on May 16, 2008. A day later, police found the body of Hemraj, the domestic help they had suspected for the murder.        
	The bench asked today: What has happened to the case? What is the progress? But neither Surat Singh, the advocate who filed the PIL, nor the counsel for Aarushis father Rajesh Talwar could answer.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 22: A conference of the worlds communist parties has reaffirmed the traditional Marxist call of class struggle, rejecting Chinas emphasis on the redistributive power of reforms and the market.        
	No amount of reform can eliminate exploitation under capitalism. Capitalism has to be overthrown. This requires intensification of ideological and working class-led popular struggles, says the resolution adopted at the end of the three-day International Meeting of the Communist and Workers Party here today.        
	The rejection of the market forces as a means to spread wealth more evenly  signified by the word redistribution  comes a day after Ai Ping, the Chinese delegate at the conference, said it was wrong to underestimate the importance of the market.        
	We must take reforms and opening up as the driving force to promote all-round economic, political, cultural and social development. It is imperative to push forward economic and political reforms to realise social equity and justice and fill the country with vitality, he had said.        
	But his approach seemed to have few takers. The resolution exhorted the working class to intensify its struggle against the rule of capital.        
	The document, which reflected the dominant view among leaders at the conclave, sought to build support for the anti-market position by blaming the current global recession on a systemic crisis of capitalism. It (the recession) demonstrates the need for its (capitalisms) revolutionary overthrow.         
	The crisis, the resolution argues, vindicates the Marxist analysis that the capitalist system is inherently crisis-ridden, and the only way out is for the working class to intensify its struggles against the rule of capital.        
	The resolution also differs from the Chinese view that it is imperative to carry forward socialist democracy.         
	Socialist democracy continues to spread illusions about the real character of capitalism, advancing slogans such as humanisation of capitalism, regulation and global governance.               
	It ends with a call to people to declare socialism as the only alternative for the future of mankind.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP sees hand of Left
                                                                                                               BJP sees hand of Left

	New Delhi, March 8: Ditched by its partner of eleven years, the BJP today lashed out at the day-dreaming Left.        
	A core committee of the party met this evening to take stock of the situation after yesterdays thunderbolt from Orissa, convinced that the comrades plotted the BJDs betrayal with an eye on Delhi.        
	A statement the party released said the BJP had been steadfast in its commitment to the alliance with Naveen Patnaiks party. But it appears that Left parties and others day-dreaming about their post-election prospects in Delhi have misled Patnaik with the help of some of the (Orissa) chief ministers controversial advisers.        
	The suspects are two Rajya Sabha MPs  Pyarimohan Mohapatra and Jay Panda.        
	One thing is for sure, Naveen Patnaik will regret the decision, BJP spokesman Ravi Shankar Prasad told PTI.        
	Analysts said Naveens move to snap ties meant a huge blow to the BJPs election preparations though some leaders privately hoped the BJD boss would be accessible after the polls.        
	The BJP has taken care not to make any personal attack on the chief minister. Rather, it is blaming the Left. One senior leader said Naveenbabu was convinced by the Left that he could play a national role after the election and must remove the albatross of the BJP before he stepped out to do that.         
	Party leaders acknowledged that Naveens popularity was at an all-time high but said his decision to dispense with the 18 per cent support the BJP enjoyed in the state was irrational.        
	There are too many prime ministerial candidates in the third front and Patnaik is definitely not the shrewdest of them, said another BJP leader.        
	These leaders refused to accept that the BJD had snapped ties because of pressures from the Sangh parivar after VHP leader Laxmananda Saraswatis murder last year that triggered anti-Christian riots.         
	The statement by the core committee said Naveens unilateral decision was a gross betrayal of the trust reposed by the people of Orissa in the alliance for over a decade.        
	In the process, the statement added, the extraordinary anti-Congress legacy of Orissa has been betrayed, but warned the states moribund Congress party that its jubilation would be short-lived.

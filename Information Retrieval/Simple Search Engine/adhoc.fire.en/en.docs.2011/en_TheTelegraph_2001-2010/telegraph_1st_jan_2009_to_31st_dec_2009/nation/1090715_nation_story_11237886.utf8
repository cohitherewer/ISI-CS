The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | On debut, Azhar bats for hockey 
                                                                                                               On debut, Azhar bats for hockey 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Azharuddin                                  
	New Delhi, July 14: The casual elegance and lazy timing havent deserted Mohammed Azharuddin but his maiden Parliament speech may have taught the former cricket captain a new trait that Indian fans often wished he had while playing  patience.        
	Tasked with the unfamiliar role of night watchman  that too on debut  the middle-order batsman tackled issues as diverse as the budget, the Sachar panel recommendations, sports and his own constituency. And in characteristic Azhar style, even the final blow that directly tore into the Opposition was timed gently, evoking laughter, not anger.        
	Azhar had just started his speech on Pranab Mukherjees budget yesterday when the Speaker asked him to continue the next day. I have never before been a night watchman, so this was unusual. But I learnt something. One of the first things my coach had told me was patience. Today, I learnt that, he said.        
	The former India captain played the team man, starting by thanking his captain  Congress president Sonia Gandhi  and other selectors like Rahul Gandhi for giving me the opportunity to speak in this August House.        
	He ended with a neatly timed stroke. Parliamentarians in the general hall of the House had asked him to hit a six whenever he first spoke, Azhar said. But I must confess, I am not very good at hitting sixes. Navjot Singh Sidhu is much better at that. So I will leave that to him, Azhar said, to peals of laughter from across the political divide. He had chosen his time well: easily more articulate, Sidhu, a former teammate and now BJP MP, was not in the House at the time to respond.         
	But the man who began his Test career with three centuries and ended it with another, provided plenty of substance in the middle, too.         
	Moradabad, his constituency, is suffering from high unemployment rate because of the global slowdown, Azhar said. The town, famous for its artisans, has seen the global demand for its products go down, he said.        
	Those who silverplate or goldplate products (a big source of livelihood in Moradabad) are developing tuberculosis by 40. I request the health minister to set up a super-speciality hospital in the area to tackle this problem, Azhar added.        
	On the Sachar panel, he said implementing its recommendations would help improve conditions of the minority community.         
	But when it came to sports, the focus wasnt on cricket which, Azhar said, was well managed. Other games, especially hockey, however need more attention, he said. But most sports federations are run like monopolies by people who never leave their posts. And 80 per cent of money sent (by the Centre) to state governments is spent on salaries (of officials), not on sportsmen.        
	He highlighted the power of sport to unite people, referring to the role cricket played in rebuilding India-South Africa relations after the end of apartheid.

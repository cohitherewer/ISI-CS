                                                                                                               House surgeons on strike
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Feb. 8: Around 350 house surgeons at the three state-run medical college hospitals in Cuttack, Burla and Berhampur went on an indefinite strike today demanding a hike in their monthly stipend.        
	We had no other option but to take the agitation path. Our demand was submitted to the government. But there has been no response so far, said All-Orissa House Surgeons Association president Biswajit Mohanty.        
	The house surgeons have threatened to intensify the agitation till their grievances are addressed by the state government. They are peeved, as there had been no increase in their stipend even after implementation of the Sixth Pay Commission recommendations on the basis of the report of a fitment committee appointed by the state government.        
	The association has demanded a hike of 70 per cent of the present salary  Rs 5,000  of assistant surgeons. The Orissa Junior Doctors Association and Orissa Medical Teachers Association have expressed support to the demands of the house surgeons.

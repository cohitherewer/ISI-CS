	New Delhi, March 14: A US-based Indian professor could give Bollywood its next bright idea  a single storyline fleshed out into multiple versions by altering anything from camera angles to scenes to dialogue.        
	Armed with technologies to manipulate still pictures and moving images, computer scientist Ramesh Raskar is talking to people in Bollywood, hoping to kickstart a new class of movies in India.         
	He calls them programmable movies.         
	A programmable movie may branch out to present a storyline in different ways to different people, said Raskar, the associate professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab in Cambridge.         
	Raskar, who grew up in Nashik and studied engineering in Pune, is an expert in the science of combining real world images with computer graphics to produce what researchers call augmented reality.         
	Imagine a highly sophisticated version of dubbing, Raskar said on the sidelines of a conference on emerging technologies.         
	In dubbing, the narrative, the frame-by-frame scenes and the camera work remain constant, only a synchronised soundtrack of the original dialogue is inserted.         
	But technologies now under development and refinement will allow film directors to change specific scenes or introduce special effects in many different ways after cinematographers have recorded a scene just once.         
	Whether portraying humour or horror, filmmakers would be able to play with images and sound to present varying levels of themes.         
	A scene may have too much blood in it. They could remove a little bit or all of it. A scene with a joke that works in one part of India may not touch a chord in another. A different version of the scene could portray an alternative set of visuals or even dialogue.         
	Raskar declined to reveal the identities of the persons in Bollywood with whom he has discussed his ideas.         
	A collaboration may lead to our students working for short periods in Bollywood or production staff from India visiting our lab, said Raskar, who is also a co-director of the Media Labs Centre for Future Storytelling, an initiative made possible through a $25-million commitment from Plymouth Rock Studios.        
	The motion picture and television studio is expected to open in Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 2010.         
	Programmable movies fit in with the goals of the new lab that is seeking to make production more versatile and economic through new technologies.         
	A movie with several versions may contribute to both filmmaking and technology, said Paul Zacharia, a Malayalam writer who had attempted alternative endings in short stories he had written more than 20 years ago.         
	But Zacharia, who had written a story involving young love with a rather tragic ending and then offered readers a different happier ending, said he had been playing with the story form rather than thinking about readers when he first attempted it.         
	Any meaningful experiment that brings together films and technology is worthwhile but whether such a production could be commercial is unclear, he said.         
	Raskar said movies have in the past lent themselves to laboratory-level technology.         
	The bullet-time sequence of the 1999 movie Matrix  the scene in which actor Keanu Reaves dodges bullets  required camera movements faster than the bullets and, Raskar said, had exploited a lab-level technology called image-based rendering.

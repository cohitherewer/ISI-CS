	Under this system, students passing Class X will no more have to apply to different colleges through multiple application forms.         
	A common admission form to any of the Plus Two streams at the 60 colleges has been introduced from 2009-10 session, a senior official of the department said. The forms can also be downloaded from www.dheorissa.in, till July 15.                    
	The colleges include 50 government colleges, College of Basic Science and Humanities under Orissa University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT) and nine government-aided colleges at Rayagada, Nawarangpur, Sonepur, Baudh, Deogarh, Jharsuguda, Nayagarh, Jagatsinghpur and Kendrapada.        
	Sources said the 60 colleges offer 30,644 seats out of the 1,74,325 seats offered by the 1,146 junior colleges in the state.

The students can take the form from any of the 60 colleges and submit it indicating the preference of stream and the college, and admission will be granted on the basis of the ranking vis--vis cut-off marks in respective colleges, the official added.        
	The order of preferences can be made on the basis of options, but the cost of submission of forms would vary accordingly.         
	While Rs 50 will be charged for the first five options, charges would go up to Rs 550 for exercising nine options and Rs 950 for 13.

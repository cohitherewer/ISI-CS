          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Raipur, June 19: A team of Mumbai police reached Chhattisgarh yesterday to determine the age of the domestic help who slammed rape charges on actor Shiney Ahuja.        
	The girl, who is from Dumartoli village of Jashpur district, 450km north of Raipur, had travelled to Mumbai three years ago through an agent.        
	According to highly placed police sources, the Mumbai team reached Jashpur today, where they were busy verifying the girls birth records. The team would be trying to trace her birth certificate and visit the school where she supposedly studied. Sources added that the visiting officers were yet to receive the documents that could establish the girls age.         
	The visit has been kept a secret as Jashpur police superintendent Akbarram Korram said he was not aware of the latters movement.         
	If the officers manage to establish that the girl is a major then Ahuja may be let off less severely under the IPC, than if she is found to be a minor.

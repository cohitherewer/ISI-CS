The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | ITS OVER
                                                                                                               ITS OVER
										      The general election, lasting nearly a month, ended on Wednesday. The Telegraph finds   a few who are happy to bid farewell to the din and others who miss the excitement                                          
	Sweta Garg, 24  
	She is: A professional dancer and a party hopper  
	Why: I know it happens only once in five years, but this 40-day stretch has been just too long. Restaurants dont stay open late and last weekend, even nightclubs shut early. Plus, the constant campaigning on loudspeakers is quite irritating.        
	Life after the polls: Ill enjoy going back to normality and partying late.                  
	Siddharth Jain, 21  
	He is: A student who hates being disturbed while studying for his CA exams
    Why: Roads wont be blocked by poll rallies and the bhashan-baaji (poll campaigning), which makes no sense anyway, will stop.        
	Life after the polls: I will study in peace now that the elections are over.                    
	Amev Burman, 21        
	He is: A student who loves to drive around at night and hang out with friends at Sharma dhaba on Ballygunge Circular Road.        
	Why: I can finally drive around without having to bother about the heightened police bandobast.        
	Life after the polls: I shall resume my normal routine and enjoy my night chai at Sharmas (which has been shutting down early because of the polls).                    
	Nandu Kumar, 30        
	He is: A taxi-driver in Tollygunge, who just wants to earn his daily bread        
	Why: My taxi has been taken for election duty. Before it went, I used to earn Rs 200 every day. I have a mother and a wife to take care of. On election duty, I am slogging from 10am to 11pm but not being paid anything. They only give fuel, Rs 14 for naashta (breakfast) and Rs 35 for lunch.        
	Life after the polls: I will first take a break and go home to Munger in Bihar before returning to my normal life here.                    
	Amit Kumar Manjhi        
	He is: The route secretary on route numbers 29 and 17; also owns 15 buses operating on different routes        
	Why: Its a loss for us every time a vehicle is requisitioned. The buses are taken for three days. There is also the worry about damage to the buses, the condition of my drivers. Obviously, Ill be relieved when the elections are over.
    Life after the polls: Ill get my buses back and try to make up for the days lost.                    
	Subrata Sil        
	He is: An electrician, who was managing lights and sound at poll meetings         
	Why: The election month was good for us. It meant extra business of about Rs 30,000-40,000! So Ill be sad when it gets over.        
	Life after the polls: Work as usual; it just wont pay as much.                    
	Mrinal Karmakar        
	He is: A veteran artist who paints banners and signs        
	Why: I will miss being busy and the buzz around the elections. The work is very enjoyable, with cartoons and nice slogans.        
	Life after the polls: Ill go back to the monotony of work as usual.                    
	Indra Madhab Dutta, 58        
	He is: Convener of the CPMs Ward 23 committee, who designed saris, T-shirts and shirts with the CPM logo.        
	Why: This election provided a great opportunity for me to showcase my creativity. Now that its all over, I will have to just wait for the next opportunity to bring in more innovations.        
	Life after the polls: Lets see what happens on May 16, then...                    
	Pintu, in his 30s (refused to be photographed)        
	He is: An auto-driver at Park Circus who flouts road rules with impunity        
	Why: Police would have cracked down on autos carrying more than four passengers had it not been for the elections. The cops on this route are straining at the leash (held by their political masters), waiting for the elections to get over.        
	Life after the polls: A likely showdown with the cops.                    
	Sourish Ghosh, 23
    He is: A student who is more interested in political news than sports or celebrity gossip        
	Why: Being a student of IR (international relations), Ive been following the elections closely this time. The Bengal elections could be very close and so Im really interested in finding out what happens.        
	Life after the polls: Ill be following the developments on the 16th to see who comes to power. That is what Im most interested in. I dont know what Ill do after that.

	Not to forget the most relieved of them all: Security forces
                Security officials say the use of choppers by candidates (like Ram Vilas Paswan in picture) made their job easier      The people most relieved at the polls being over are the security establishment. Before the elections, intelligence inputs had suggested that almost everyone from Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh to L.K. Advani and Narendra Modi was a potential target for Pakistan-based terrorists. 
    But the only violence has been the Maoist attacks and stray political clashes in a few states, including Bengal. There hasn rsquo;t been a single terror strike. Home ministry officials attribute this to a ldquo;coincidence rdquo; mdash; the turmoil in northwestern Pakistan.
    ldquo;Pakistan is so preoccupied fighting the Taliban in Swat and other places that it is not in a position to plot terror attacks in India. This, we believe, is the single biggest reason for the terror-free polls, rdquo; an intelligence official said.
                The intelligence agencies did not report any immediate threat during the elections, nor were any terrorists arrested.
    This election saw lower paramilitary deployment than even last year rsquo;s November-December Assembly polls, courtesy the heavy security on the international borders following 26/11 and the developments in the neighbouring countries.
    The government struck down a proposal   for more forces on election duty mdash; one reason 
  the IPL was shifted out of India.
    ldquo;The number of paramilitary personnel deployed in Jammu and Kashmir alone during last year rsquo;s Assembly polls (600 companies) was the same as that posted across the country for the general election this time, rdquo; a senior home ministry official said.
                Security forces had geared up for a terrorist threat   to the elections but the polling passed peacefully      In the run-up to the polls, unprecedented security instructions were passed on to political parties and state governments. Helicopters and defence ministry aircraft were used to carry out surveillance and aid ground patrolling by the resource-strapped paramilitary units.
    Most top leaders of the political parties travelled by helicopter rather than by car, unlike previous years when the clouds of dust from their convoys signalled that it was election season.
    Officials denied that the home ministry had instructed the parties to arrange for choppers, but the change in mode of transport did help the security personnel.
    ldquo;If these leaders went around in cars, innumerable road-opening parties (those who check the routes for landmines) would have been deployed in the light of the threats, rdquo; a home ministry official said.

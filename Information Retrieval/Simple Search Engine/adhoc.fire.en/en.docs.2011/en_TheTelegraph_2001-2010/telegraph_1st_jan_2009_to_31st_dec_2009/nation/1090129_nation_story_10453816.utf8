The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Gehlot vows to fight pub culture 
                                                                                                               Gehlot vows to fight pub culture 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jaipur, Jan. 28: Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot today reiterated that pub culture would not be allowed to be promoted in the state.        
	On the sidelines of a Congress meet here, Gehlot took a dig at the previous BJP regime which, he said, allowed liquor shops to mushroom all over the state and even in shopping malls.         
	The chief minister said his government does not support pub culture and would try to reverse it.         
	The new excise policy unveiled by the Congress government says beer and Indian Made Foreign Liquor (IMFL) would carry a prohibitive 20 per cent VAT from the next fiscal, up from the current 4 per cent.         
	Bars and restaurants would also have to pay an increased licence fee, putting the burden on the consumer.         
	The number of outlets serving IMFL in city circles would be reduced from 1,800 now to 1,000, and the number of dry days increased to five in the state.         
	The government had earlier ordered closure of 156 liquor shops near educational institutions and religious places across the state.         
	Liquor shops are now allowed to stay open from 10am to 8pm, four hours less than in the BJP regime when they could stay open from 8am to 11pm.

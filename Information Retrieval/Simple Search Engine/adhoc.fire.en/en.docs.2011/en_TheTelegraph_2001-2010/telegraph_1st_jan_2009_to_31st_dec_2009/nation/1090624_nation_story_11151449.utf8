	Lucknow, June 23: The Mayavati government today ordered withdrawal of a ban on wearing jeans in four Kanpur girls colleges after 10 days of protests by the students.        
	Todays order was issued by governor T.V. Rajeswar, the chancellor of all universities in Uttar Pradesh. The order made it clear that no campus could issue such edicts.        
	Rajeswar had yesterday met chief minister Mayavati, who expressed her disapproval of such curbs.        
	There is no government ban on wearing jeans in colleges and colleges have been instructed not to implement such bans, the order said.        
	This afternoon, higher education secretary Kamran Rizvi said: There is no dress code prescribed for colleges in the state, hence no college can issue such a directive.        
	 Strict instructions have been sent to vice-chancellors and district magistrates to watch if any college was taking action against students wearing jeans, Rizvi said. He made it clear that even unaided colleges could not clamp such bans.         
	The four Kanpur colleges hadnt formally lifted the curbs till this evening but are likely to do so now.        
	The college girls were thrilled. We will go to college tomorrow wearing jeans as a mark of celebration. Surely we wont look indecent in such clothes, said Pratibha Srivastava of Juhari Devi Girls College, one of the four that had ordered the dress restrictions.        
	The colleges, which had also banned skirts and tight tops, argued that such outfits provoked eve-teasing. The decision (ban) had been taken to check eve-teasing and ensure discipline, DG Girls Degree College principal Meeta Jamal had said.Such dresses attract obscene comments. There are over 8,000 students in the (four) colleges and we cannot overlook their safety. A dress code will check eve-teasing.        
	The protests were sporadic and unorganised. It was a spontaneous outburst. Students gathered in front of the colleges and decried the ban, said Ameesha Tiwari from S.N. Sen Degree College.         
	Some wanted to move on, though. We want to put this (row) behind us as a bad dream and return to studies, said a student.        
	Former vice-chancellors had spoken against the ban. Roop Rekha Verma, a former vice-chancellor of Lucknow University, dubbed the move retrograde.

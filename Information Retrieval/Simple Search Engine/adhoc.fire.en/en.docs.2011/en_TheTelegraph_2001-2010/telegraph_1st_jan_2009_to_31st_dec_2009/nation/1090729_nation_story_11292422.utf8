                                                                                                               Towers blown up, red week begins
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, July 28: Reports reaching the Cuttack police headquarters said Maoists blew up two mobile service towers at Padmagiri in Malkangiri today.        
	The control rooms of the towers belonging to two private operators were set on fire to apparently disrupt communication in the area. Fearing attacks, public transporters kept their vehicles off the road in Gajapati, Rayagada, Koraput and Malkangiri.        
	Meanwhile, Orissa government has sounded a red alert in Naxalite-hit regions, especially in Malkangiri, Koraput and Rayagada, as the 37th Martyrs Week began from today. The week is observed by Naxalites every year to commemorate the death anniversary of Charu Mazumdar.        
	Director-general of police Manmohan Praharaj said a red alert was sounded yesterday. Security was beefed up to thwart possible attacks, as was done in the past, said the DGP talking to The Telegraph today.        
	Police machinery in districts was geared up and special patrolling was started in vulnerable pockets. Vehicles and people suspected of Naxalite links are still being checked.         
	Forces in Malkangiri, Rayagada, Gajapati, Koraput, Keonjhar, Sundergarh and Kandhamal, have intensified operations, besides tearing off scores of hand-written posters and banners that reportedly called for peoples participation.         
	Senior police officers in the concerned districts had reviewed the law and order situation to prevent any eventuality, official sources said.        
	The police have been on a high alert in areas bordering Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh. Search operations by armed forces at bordering villages are on. Combing operations are also on in Motu, Kalimela, Balimela and Chitrakonda.        
	Several companies of Central Reserve Police Force, Special Operation Group, Orissa State Armed Police and Indian Reserve Battalion had been deployed at police stations falling under rebel-hit regions such as Motu, Kalimela, MV-79, Chitrakonda and Potteru in Malkangiri.         
	Besides security at Malkangiri and Koraput jails, where several rebels are lodged, has been beefed up anticipating possible attacks. Measures have also been taken at armouries, official sources said.

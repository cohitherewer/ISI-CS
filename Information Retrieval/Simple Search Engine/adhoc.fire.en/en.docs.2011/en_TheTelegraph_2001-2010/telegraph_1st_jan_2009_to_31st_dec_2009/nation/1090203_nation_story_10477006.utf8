  - Law minister says chief election commissioner first among equals, enjoys no primacy        SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              Bharadwaj, Chawla				                                       
	New Delhi, Feb. 2: Navin Chawla will be the next chief election commissioner in keeping with the long-established convention of appointing the senior-most election commissioner as the CEC, the government said today.        
	Chawla will be at the helm of the Election Commission, overseeing the 2009 general elections, as soon as outgoing CEC N. Gopalaswami retires on April 20 despite the latters recommendation that Chawla be sacked over his alleged partisan conduct as election commissioner.        
	Law minister H.R. Bharadwaj said so in as many words on the sidelines of a conference of law secretaries and state registrar generals at the Vigyan Bhavan here. I will advise the President (through the Council of Ministers) to appoint the senior-most election commissioner as the chief election commissioner, Bharadwaj said.         
	His ministry, which forwards proposals for appointing and dismissing election commissioners, will process Chawlas appointment papers soon, he said. The government will also begin the process of appointing a third election commissioner to fill the vacancy that will be created by Gopalaswamis retirement, he said.        
	The government will not hesitate in processing papers for appointment of the next CEC and as per convention the senior-most gets it, Bharadwaj said.        
	Bharadwaj added that the government would stick by the affidavit given to the Supreme Court in which it had shrugged off allegations against Chawla.         
	Replying to a court notice on an NDA petition seeking Chawlas removal, the government had told the court on July 24, 2006: The allegations do not make out any case of illegality and/or impropriety which would warrant the initiation of further steps by the government to seek the removal of Chawla.         
	Today, the law minister said: As you know, once an affidavit is filed in court, it cannot be withdrawn. I have personally found nothing against him. What is the relevance of the Emergency now? The minister was referring to allegations that Chawla was party to misdeeds committed during the Emergency.        
	Bharadwaj, however, said his ministry was examining Gopalaswamis recommendation and would send a reply to the Election Commission in a day or two. Chawla is the senior-most member of the Election Commission. We have received a letter from his colleague against him. The law ministry is examining it and will send a reply to the EC in a day or two.         
	Article 324, which was cited by Gopalaswami in an earlier affidavit to assert his power to seek the removal of a colleague, only offers constitutional protection to the CEC against arbitrary removal by the government of the day, the minister said. It confines itself to stating that he can be removed by impeachment, Bharadwaj said.         
	It is intended to protect the independence of the Election Commission. It does not give the CEC the power to punish other election commissioners, he said. The CEC has no primacy. All are equals. Like the CJI (Chief Justice of India), the CEC is the first among equals.         
	He can write to the law ministry but his recommendation is not binding on the government, Bharadwaj said. Even Soli Sorabjee, who was attorney-general during the NDA regime has said so, Bharadwaj pointed out.        
	He said the process of removal of any election commissioner would have to be first initiated by the government. Even in such a case where the government has sought the CECs opinion on removal of the election commissioner, his opinion is not binding.

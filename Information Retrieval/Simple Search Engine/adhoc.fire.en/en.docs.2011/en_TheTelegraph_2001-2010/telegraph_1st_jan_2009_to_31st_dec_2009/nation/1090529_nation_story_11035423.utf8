The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mamata returns Tata cheque 
                                                                                                               Mamata returns Tata cheque 
          OUR BUREAU                            Tata, Mamata                          
	May 28: Mamata Banerjee has ordered Trinamul leaders to immediately return an election donation of Rs 28 lakh from the Tatas.        
	Didi flew into a rage and asked Mukul (Roy) to immediately return the cheque. She was very upset at the fact that an organisation that had blamed her for the Nanos exit had offered the Trinamul Congress money, a party MP said from Delhi.        
	Roy said he had sent the Tatas a letter today saying Trinamul doesnt take money in this manner from any organisation. The cheque had arrived day before yesterday, Roy said, on the ground that our partys performance had been very good.        
	The Tatas confirmed having offered the donation. The money was indeed offered to Ms (Mamata) Banerjee. However, please note that the Tatas do not distribute the money. The Tata Electoral Trust offers money to any party that meets the criteria laid down in its mandate, a Tata spokesperson said in Mumbai.        
	Tata firms provide money to the trust, set up in 1996 as one of Indias first corporate endeavours to bring about transparency in election funding, but have no say in its distribution.        
	The trust distributes 50 per cent of its corpus before the elections in the ratio of the seats that qualifying parties have in Parliament. The rest is handed out after the elections, in proportion to the seats won. If Trinamul received the money after the elections, it is possible that it either did not qualify or didnt have sufficient MPs in the last Lok Sabha. Mamata was the only one.        
	The Tata system of electoral funding is so transparent that funds were sent even to Trinamul, which had obstructed the implementation of the Nano project, a source said. He declined to say how much was given to the Congress or the Left parties.        
	The trust has three members: senior Supreme Court advocate Dinesh Vyas, industrialist Ardeshir Dubash and social worker Shirin Bharucha.        
	Another Trinamul source suggested that accepting the money wouldnt have made a difference since candidates spent much larger sums.        
	A Trinamul general secretary said the Rs 28 lakh was possibly worked out on the basis of Rs 1 lakh for each of the 28 nominees the party had fielded in the elections.         
	I am not a Tata stooge Because of this organisation, I had to undertake a 26-day fast (against the Singur land acquisition), a Trinamul general secretary quoted Mamata as saying.        
	Pharmaceutical major Ranbaxy also used to provide equal amounts to the Congress and the Akali Dal, as reflected in its 2004-05 books. It is not known if the company, sold to Japans Daiichi Sankyo last year, did so this time.

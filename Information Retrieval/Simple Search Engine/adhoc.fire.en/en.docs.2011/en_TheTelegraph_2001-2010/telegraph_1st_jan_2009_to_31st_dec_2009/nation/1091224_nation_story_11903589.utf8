The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cry to shield films from court cuts
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cry to shield films from court cuts
          ARCHIS MOHAN                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 23: Leading Hindi filmmakers want their movies to be insulated from any judicial intervention once these get the censor boards certificate.        
	Some, like Vishal Bhardwaj and Nagesh Kukunoor, today gave vent to their woes at an information and broadcasting ministry meeting.        
	The two wanted an end to the judiciary instructing directors to chop and change their films to suit the palates of sundry caste, community and professional groups, especially when the film has been cleared by the Central Board of Film Certification, known as the censor board.        
	Sources said the ministry, which controls the censor board, was sympathetic to the demand but added that the legal feasibility and framework for putting such a shield in place would need to be looked into.        
	Bhardwaj and Kukunoor flagged the issue at the meeting of a committee that was discussing revamping the National Film Awards. Both demanded the censor board certification be made unimpeachable in a court of law. They said at present any publicity-seeking individual or group moves court against a film with flimsy arguments. The two said such incidents lowered the censor certifications sanctity, said a source.        
	Others on the 10-member committee, chaired by Shyam Bengal, include Ashok Vishwanathan, Jahnu Baruah, Sai Paranjpye and Sharmila Tagore.         
	Another committee to revamp the International Film Festival of India (IFFI) also held its first meeting today. The panel includes Kamal Haasan, Karan Johar, Prasoon Joshi and Govind Nihalani among others.        
	Both Bhardwaj and Kukunoor had recently run into controversies related to their films. A song from Bhardwajs Kaminey kicked up a row after the Teli Samaj had objected to the lyrics. Kukunoor had to drop the word underwear from Bombay to Bangkok because a censor board member felt it could lead to trouble. Of late, there have been many instances of filmmakers having to bend to the wishes of the judiciary after interest groups filed public interest cases, or when the films have led to law and order problems.         
	The ministry is trying to revamp both the National Film Awards and the IFFI. The two committees are to recommend changes by March 15.

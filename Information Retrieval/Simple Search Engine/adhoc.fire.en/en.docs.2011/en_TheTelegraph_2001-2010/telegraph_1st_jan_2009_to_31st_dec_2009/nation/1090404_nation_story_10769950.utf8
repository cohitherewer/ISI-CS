The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | IITs demand quota waiver for select courses
                                                                                                               IITs demand quota waiver for select courses
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, April 3: The Indian Institutes of Technology have asked the Centre to exempt them from OBC quotas in select courses in a controversial demand that pits the institutions against the governments policies.        
	The IITs have demanded exemption for select courses from meeting the 27 per cent reservations required under the OBC quota law that divided the countrys academic community when it was mooted two years back.         
	The demand was made two months ago, but was deliberately kept under wraps by both the government and the IITs, top officials of the human resource development ministry and the institutes confirmed to The Telegraph.         
	The Central Educational Institutions Act  commonly known as the OBC reservation law  requires every central institution to reserve 27 per cent seats for backward classes by the 2010 session.        
	The law, enforced last year after surviving a bunch of court petitions, was grudgingly accepted by all affected institutions, and the IITs introduced 9 per cent OBC quotas in 2008. The IITs promised to raise reservation to 18 per cent by the 2009 session and 27 per cent by 2010.        
	But at the meeting of the IIT Council on January 26 this year, the institutes asked for the law to be relaxed for courses that were relatively unpopular among reserved category candidates in 2008. The council is the highest decision-making body of the IITs.        
	The IITs argued that increasing quotas to 18 per cent in these courses would only lead to a wastage of seats as the institutes had to struggle to fill even the seats reserved in 2008.        
	The controversial demand was left out not just from press notes on the council meeting but also from the first draft of the minutes prepared by the ministry, sources said.         
	IIT Kanpur director Sanjay Dhande, however, insisted the demand be included in the minutes, after the IITs objected to its exclusion from the draft, the sources said.         
	The final minutes of the meeting, which have just been finalised, clearly mention the IIT demand and have forced the HRD ministry into responding. The Telegraph has access to the minutes.        
	A note has been sent to the law ministry containing the IIT demand, with comments that reveal the HRD ministry is not in favour of the proposed exemption.        
	The HRD ministry has said in its note that the IIT demand appears contrary to provisions of the law  which does not allow the government to grant any exemptions even if it wishes to.         
	Officially, the HRD ministry sources said the opinion of the law ministry would form the basis for a reply to the IIT demand.        
	But in private, ministry officials dismissed the argument behind the IIT demand as ridiculous and silly. Just because fewer students from the reserved category applied for a particular course in 2008 does not mean the same pattern will repeat itself in 2009, an official argued.        
	The IIT demand is the latest instance of a conflict in perceptions over reservations between elite educational institutions, like the IITs and the Indian Institutes of Management, and the government.         
	The institutes have demanded exemption from quotas for faculty members, and several teachers have written or commented against the reservation policy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | French UN finger at Russia
                                                                                                               French UN finger at Russia
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 24: A high-ranking French politician today made an oblique comment that the US and Russia were against India getting a permanent seat in the Security Council when the UN body is expanded.        
	Jea-Pierre Chevenemet, a former defence and interior minister, is part of a visiting three-member French parliamentary delegation.         
	He said at a news conference that there were some constrains and hesitations that came up in the way of the UNSC reforms to give India a permanent seat.        
	Asked to explain those and the countries that are in the way of India, the French leader made an oblique reference to the US and Russia.        
	France cant change the opinion of the world. France and the UK have declared their support to India and China supported you at the Nuclear Suppliers Group discussions, etc. Now you can deduce the answer, he said.         
	This leaves the US and Russia as the suspects, as there are five members in the UNSC.         
	N-treaty thrust        
	A UN Security Council summit chaired by US President Barack Obama has approved a resolution calling on all nuclear weapons states to join the non-proliferation treaty. India reiterated its stand that it would not sign.        
	The resolution also called for an end to the proliferation of atomic weapons but did not name either Iran or North Korea, which Western countries regards as the top atomic threats.

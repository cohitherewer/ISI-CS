The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Day one of session stormy
                                                                                                               Day one of session stormy
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 9: The budget session of the Assembly that began today started on a stormy note with the combined Opposition interrupting the governors address and finally walking out.        
	As soon as Governor M.C. Bhandare began reading out his 32-page printed address, the leader of Opposition, Ulaka Ramachandra, stood up to make a parallel speech.         
	He was also heard urging the governor to not read a speech that was prepared by a government that won the civic polls by using money.         
	Ramachandra made an obvious reference to the recently concluded Cuttack Municipal Corporation (CMC) and Baripada municipality elections. Ruling BJD has swept both the polls on Friday.         
	But as Bhandare ignored the leaders plea, now livid members of the Opposition tore away the speech booklet and threw it to air. The members were in no mood to relent to the governors repeated pleas to stop the pandemonium and resorted to sloganeering instead. The members then stormed the well and thumped the Speakers podium to disrupt the address.         
	Why do you waste your time reading the speech that is far from reality and of false promises? We dont want to hear the speech prepared by the government which purchases its vote, said the leader of the Opposition.         
	The Opposition Congress, NCP, JMM, CPI, CPM and SUCI leaders staged an angry walkout and a boycott.         
	The governor, who read out his address for a marathon an hour and 20 minutes, claimed that the law and order situation had remained normal in the past year. He, however, admitted that Kandhamal had witnessed problems after the death of Laxmananda Saraswati.         
	As this was the governors last speech before the elections, the government chose to paint a rosy picture of the states economy and highlighted its achievements in industry, IT, irrigation, agriculture and tourism. There has been a 4 per cent rise in the arrival of foreign tourists and 12 per cent growth in inflow of domestic visitors despite global meltdown, Bhandare said.

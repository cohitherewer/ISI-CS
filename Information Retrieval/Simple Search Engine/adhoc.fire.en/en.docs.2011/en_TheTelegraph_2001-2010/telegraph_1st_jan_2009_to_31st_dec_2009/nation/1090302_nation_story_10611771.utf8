          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, March 1: A senior leader of the Lok Janshakti Party today joined the ruling Janata Dal (United) and could take on Lalu Prasad in the general election.        
	Ranjan Yadav, senior vice-president of Ram Vilas Paswans LJP and once Lalu Prasads bosom friend, announced his decision in the presence of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar and JD(U) chief Sharad Yadav.        
	Nitish is set to pit Ranjan against Lalu Prasad from Pataliputra, the Yadav-dominated Lok Sabha seat that the railway minister has been thinking of contesting from in addition to his current seat of Saran.        
	Ranjan blamed Paswan for his exit. I had joined the LJP to help him in the battle to liberate Bihar from the jungle raaj sponsored by Lalu-Rabri. However, it is now evident Paswan is on course to strike a friendship with Lalu Prasad. If that is the case, I have no business being in the LJP, he said.

                                                                                    Monday , November 16 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Delhi not in hurry to give clean chit
          OUR BUREAU AND PTI                          Assistant police inspector Sanjay Govilkar, who played a key role in arresting Mumbai gunman Ajmal Kasab. The first anniversary of the 26/11 attacks falls on Thursday next week. (PTI)                                  
	Nov. 15: The Centre today said no clean chit had been given so far to anyone, not even filmmaker Mahesh Bhatts son Rahul, in the probe into the activities of US terror suspect David Coleman Headley.        
	Details also emerged of the visit of his alleged accomplice Tahawwur Hassan Rana to Kerala 10 days before the Mumbai attacks.        
	In New Delhi, Union home secretary G.K. Pillai said: We have not given clean chit to anyone. Investigation is still on.        
	Bhatts son Rahul had on his own volunteered information to Mumbai police that he had come across a person named Headely in the city. The Bhatt family had said the police had given Rahul a clean chit but was upset by reports that central agencies had not yet pronounced an explicit all-clear.        
	Sources said Pillais statement today did not mean that Rahul was a suspect as there was nothing illegal in people interacting with visitors from abroad. The complexion of the case will change only if collusion or deliberate suppression of facts is established, a source said.         
	 But, the source added, the government cannot be expected to issue a clean chit until the probe is concluded in what is emerging as an almost cross-country trail of Headley and his alleged accomplice.        
	The National Investigation Agency (NIA), which has formed several teams to investigate the case, has reportedly questioned Rahul and three others, including the proprietor of gym where Headley is believed to have met the filmmakers son, the sources said. At least one of the three questioned is said to be related to a prominent family in Bollywood.        
	A case was registered against Rana and Headley by the NIA on November 11 under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and for conspiring to wage war against the country.         
	Pillai said four to six weeks would be required to complete the investigations. Investigations are on, it will take us at least, I will put it as something between four and six weeks, to complete the probe. Once that probe is completed, we will know the links, he said.        
	In reply to a specific question on Ranas movements, Pillai said the suspect had visited Kochi in Kerala and the probe to find out what he did while in the city was on.        
	Keralas director-general of police, Jacob Punnoose, said: A man named Tahawwur Hussain Rana had stayed in a hotel in Kochi on November 16. He also said the state police had not received any official communication from the central security agencies.        
	Records in Kerala showed that Rana checked in at a five-star hotel in Kochi on November 16 and left for Mumbai the next day. Officials were investigating whether the purpose of Ranas visit was to recruit youths for militant activities.        
	Some television channels in Kerala reported that Ranas wife had accompanied him to Kochi.        
	 Headley, a 49-year-old Pakistan-born US citizen, was arrested in Chicago last month by the FBI, which said he was part of a Lashkar-e-Toiba plan to carry out attacks in India, including Delhis National Defence College, Dehraduns Doon School and Woodstock School in Mussoorie.

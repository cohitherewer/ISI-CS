	Srinagar, Oct. 14: Home minister P. Chidambaram today reached out to Kashmir separatists with an offer of talks with every section but didnt call for laying down arms as he made a distinction between Northeast insurgents and political groups in the Valley.        
	In Kashmir, there are political groups, some of which may be advocating separatism. But we have made it clear that we will talk to different schools of opinion here and consult every section, the minister told an editors meet.        
	Chidambaram, however, made it clear there would be no talks with insurgent groups in the Northeast if they continue to insist on secessionism.        
	We have made it clear that insurgent groups in the Northeast have to give up demand for secessionism and lay down their arms and then only will we talk to them, he said.        
	Asked if the two conditions also applied for talks with Kashmir separatists, he said: There is no need to copy (in Kashmir) the solutions that have worked in other parts of India.        
	Kashmir, he explained, had a unique geography and history and needed a unique solution.        
	Moderate separatist leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, chairman of the separatist amalgam Hurriyat Conference, welcomed the ministers offer as a good step, but pro-Pakistan hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani said it was meaningless and insisted on tripartite talks aimed at self-determination.        
	Chidambaram set the stage for talks with separatists, saying amendments to the Armed Forces Special Powers Act had been finalised. The revocation of the act, which gives unbridled powers to security forces to arrest, raid or open fire without the permission of a magistrate, is one key demand of mainstream and separatist groups.        
	The amendments, he added, will be implemented uniformly, be it in Kashmir or the Northeast.        
	Chidambaram, on a two-day visit to the Valley, said the Congress-led central government wanted a honourable, equitable and acceptable solution to the Kashmir problem.        
	There will be political differences and political opinions. There will be shades of opinion, which are described as extremist. There will be some voices who will be pleading for a separate nation. We accept that and it is a reality.        
	There are groups, he said, that dont contest elections but have a point of view. We recognise there are several points of view and we will have dialogue with every section of society.         
	But the talks cant be held in the full glare of cameras. A dialogue can take place with quiet diplomacy, we have to hold it quietly, he said.        
	Although he didnt call for surrender of arms by militants in Kashmir, Chidambaram said the Centre had zero tolerance for violence.        
	Whatever the cause you have there is no place for violence, he said, listing the number of militant strikes this year. For the first nine months of the calendar year, around 395 incidents have taken place, (the) lowest in nine years. Sixty civilians and 66 security force men have died while 185 militants have been neutralised during this period.        
	Without mincing words, Chidambaram blamed Pakistan for infiltrations across the Line of Control and fomenting trouble in the Valley. The authorities in Pakistan are recruiting young boys, training and brainwashing them, he said, before pushing them into India to create mayhem.        
	The minister said the government might have to ban prepaid mobile phone SIM cards in Kashmir because of security reasons. At this moment there is no move to ban prepaid cards. But if our efforts to persuade people to switch over to post-paid cards do not materialise we may have to ban prepaid SIM cards in the Kashmir valley, he said.

	New Delhi, May 12 (PTI): Sanjeev Nanda, serving a five-year term for killing six persons in a BMW hit-and-run case, was granted three weeks bail by Delhi High Court today to attend the funeral of his grandfather Admiral S.M. Nanda.         
	Considering the patriotic and dedicated services rendered by Admiral Nanda, which is a well-acknowledged fact, I feel the sentence of the appellant deserved to be suspended for a period of three weeks, the judge said.

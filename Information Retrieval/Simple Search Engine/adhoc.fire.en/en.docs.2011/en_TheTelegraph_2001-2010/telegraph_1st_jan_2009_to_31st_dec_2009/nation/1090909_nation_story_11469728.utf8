          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 8: An Indian camera aboard the Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft tasked with mapping the entire lunar surface has covered 70 per cent of the moon during the 10-month mission, Indian space agency Isro said today.        
	But the area covered by the Terrain-Mapping Camera and Hyper Spectral Imager, instruments developed by Isro, was less than that covered by a US-built payload. The Moon Mineralogy Mapper, from Brown University and Nasa, covered more than 95 per cent of the lunar surface.        
	The Chandrayaan-1 has captured data of exceptional quality, Isro said in a statement at the end of a two-day meeting in Bangalore to analyse the accumulated data. Some of the data quality surpassed initial expectations, Isro said.        
	Scientists believe that analysis of the data, aimed at understanding better the characteristics and evolution of the moon, could take six months to three years.         
	The Chandrayaan-1, launched last October, orbited the moon 3,400 times and sent 70,000 images of the lunar surface before troubles started brewing on the spacecraft this April. On August 29, Isro said it had lost radio contact with the spacecraft. It is still orbiting the moon, but with no communication or control.         
	Scientists at the Bangalore meet said other instruments were able to conduct planned experiments during the mission.

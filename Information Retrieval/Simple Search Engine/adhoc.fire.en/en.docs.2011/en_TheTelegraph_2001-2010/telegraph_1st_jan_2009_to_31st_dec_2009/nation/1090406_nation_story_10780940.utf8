	Chennai: M. Karunanidhis eldest son, M.K. Azhagiri, has been nominated from the Madurai Lok Sabha constituency, now held by the CPM.    
	The DMKs list of 21 candidates released today also renominates Dayanidhi Maran, chief minister Karunanidhis grandnephew, from Central Chennai.    
	This means the DMKs first family will have two members in the fray.     
	Four sitting ministers did not get tickets and two  T.R. Baalu and A. Raja  had to move to new constituencies, the shift compelled by the delimitation exercise.    
	Two actors are also on the DMK list, which is an eclectic mix of sitting MPs and some new faces. Two long-time party activists, R.S. Bharathi and T.K.S. Elangovan, have been given a ticket for the first time, from Chennai South and North respectively.    
	The focus, though, will be on Madurai, where Azhagiri has emerged the undisputed strongman after helping pull off the victories of DMK and ally Congress in three byelections over the past two years  allegedly with muscle and money power.    
	With his supporters determined to ensure he wins by the largest margin in the state, the high-voltage Madurai contest could test the election commissions vow to ensure free and fair polls.    
	Azhagiris entry will also mean he will be the DMKs pointman in Delhi, overshadowing the likes of Dayanidhi Maran, Kanimozhi (Karunanidhis daughter) and T.R. Baalu. Also, if the DMK comes to share power, he is expected to be its first choice as minister.     
	Azhagiris emergence from behind the scenes will also queer the pitch in the succession battle within the DMK, after Karunanidhi.     
	Azhagiri is likely to challenge the authority of M.K. Stalin, his younger, but arguably more experienced, brother who is currently a minister in the DMK government.         
	New Delhi: Gods Own Country isnt short on variety. But there seems an exception  names.    
	Voters in Kozhikode and Kottayam should know  the two constituencies have six namesakes each. They are among 15 seats that have 38 candidates with similar names. The state has 20 seats.     
	Many have similar symbols, too. A shuttlecock has, for instance, has been chosen by some. This might be mistaken for the Congresss hand at a quick glance. In Kottayam, the CPMs K. Suresh Kurup is up against five namesakes. There are many more.

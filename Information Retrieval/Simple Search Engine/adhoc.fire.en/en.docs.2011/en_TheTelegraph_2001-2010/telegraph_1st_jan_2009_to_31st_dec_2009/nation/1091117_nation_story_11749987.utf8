          SANJAY K. JHA                           Koda in Chaibasa, Ranchi, on Monday (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 16: A combative Madhu Koda, premature leaks of investigation details and rumour mills have generated unease within the Congress, preventing party leaders from politically milking the ongoing anti-corruption drive in the run-up to the Jharkhand elections.               
	The apparent sluggishness in the probe may be a fallout of this thinking, though Congress leaders ridicule any suggestion that investigations can be remote-controlled in this manner. Sources say a section of Congress leaders, both at the state and national levels, worked hard to arrest the frenzied pace of investigations into the former chief ministers alleged huge wealth, at least till the elections were over. Kodas threat to reveal all also compelled the government to opt for a measured approach.        
	The Congress was prepared to confront the charges of politically nurturing Koda but what confounded the problem were reports suggesting involvement of its leaders in sharing the booty. The names of a few local leaders, a few from Maharashtra and a couple of central leaders were doing the rounds, forcing the party to adopt a defensive approach.         
	Party spokesperson Manish Tiwari today recalled the Supreme Court judgment in the hawala case which refused to take diary listings as evidence. This obviously is a cautious approach from a party that always iterates its zero-tolerance policy on corruption. Tiwari also said the former chief minister should reveal whatever he had before the appropriate authority.        
	Asked about the names in circulation, Tiwari said: This is the normal reaction of an accused. They try to intimidate investigators by making wild allegations. We are not intimidated by such threats or blackmail.        
	Congress sources, however, admit in private that the high command is aware of the close links Koda had with some UPA leaders and concede that some people have received favours. The Congress as a party cannot be blamed. If some individuals were close to Koda, they will face the music, one leader maintained.

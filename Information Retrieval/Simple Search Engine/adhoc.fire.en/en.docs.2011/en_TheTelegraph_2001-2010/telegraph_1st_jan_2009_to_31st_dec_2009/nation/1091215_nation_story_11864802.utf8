The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Africa cries for Kyoto
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Africa cries for Kyoto

	Dec. 14: Impassioned pleas by African delegates for a climate accord and a call by the British climate change secretary to countries to move from their entrenched positions today reflected the deep fissures that divide nations in climate change talks.         
	As negotiators and ministers from 192 countries began the second week of the climate summit in Copenhagen, African delegates articulated their fears that the summit was being steered to abandon the 12-year-old Kyoto Protocol  a legally binding agreement that imposes greenhouse gas emission reduction targets on industrialised countries, but not on developing countries.         
	The conference presidency (Denmark) and the developed countries are trying to pursue a track of negotiation that appears to be intended to end the protocol, Algerias chief negotiator Kemal Djemouia said.         
	The African group is completely disappointed, he said.         
	Industrialised countries have argued that the Kyoto Protocol leaves out the US which never ratified it and China which, as a developing country, is not obliged to take on any binding emission reductions.         
	Some developing country negotiators believe the summit appears aimed at laying the groundwork for a pact to replace the protocol, covering more nations and possibly incorporating domestic actions pledged by developing countries.         
	But negotiators have warned that a new pact could take years to come into effect.         
	Well be taking a risk. No one can ensure a new treaty will be ratified by all. The Kyoto Protocol took seven years to enter into force (in 2005). A new treaty could take longer, the Algerian delegate said.         
	We cannot, we will never accept the killing of the Kyoto Protocol, a delegate from Mali said. The killing of the Kyoto Protocol will mean, I can say, the killing of Africa  and before accepting that we should all die first.         
	British climate change secretary Ed Milliband today said continuing with the Kyoto treaty where some (countries) are left out would be a massive disservice to the planet. He said the central aim of the negotiations was to ensure that global (greenhouse) emissions peaked by 2020. We can only do that with countries beyond the Kyoto Protocol, he said.         
	The developing countries have charged the industrialised countries with not coming forth with either ambitious emission reduction targets nor clear plans for long-term finance to help the developing countries pursue clean energy options.

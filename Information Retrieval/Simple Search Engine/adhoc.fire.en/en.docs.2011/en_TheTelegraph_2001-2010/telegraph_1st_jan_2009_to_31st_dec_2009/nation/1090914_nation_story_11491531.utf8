          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 13: An ancient system of medicine rooted in Buddhist philosophy and widely practised in the Himalayan region may soon gain formal recognition in India, earning a status similar to other traditional systems of treatment.         
	The Union cabinet has approved a plan to hoist the Sowa-Rigpa system of medicine into the set of three recognised traditional systems  Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha  through an amendment to a 1970 law that regulates traditional medicine.         
	The legal recognition to Sowa-Rigpa will facilitate the preservation and propagation of this system of medicine, which is practised along the Himalayan region from Ladakh to Darjeeling and Sikkim to Arunachal Pradesh, a health official said.         
	Weve been waiting for this for so many years, Lobsang Thupten, a practitioner of Sowa-Rigpa in Darjeeling, said.         
	Formal recognition could help us reach out to more people, said Thupten, who studied for five years at an institution of Tibetan medicine in Dharamsala (Himachal Pradesh) and completed a year-long internship before joining the clinic in Darjeeling.         
	Practitioners of Sowa-Rigpa  called Amchis  in India currently operate through a network of about 55 small clinics across the country. We get patients with all kinds of illnesses, including chronic ailments, Thupten said.         
	It primarily uses herbal medication, including some plants that are found mainly at high altitudes, and has similarities with Ayurveda, said Surinder Sharma, adviser in the health ministry.         
	He said the cabinet approval indicated the government has appreciated the benefits of this system of medicine. It will become a fourth member in the family of the Indian systems of medicine, Sharma said.         
	The basic textbook for Sowa-Rigpa is a centuries-old treatise called the Rgyud Bzi, closely linked to Buddhist philosophy. Health officials said the formal recognition of this system of medicine would allow the government to promote standardisation of education, medical practices and research towards the development of formal pharmacological guidelines in Sowa Rigpa.         
	Well be able to focus on plants important in Sowa Rigpa, said Bikram Singh Sajwan, chief executive officer with an agency involved in supplying plants for the traditional systems of medicine.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Advanis reign faces questions 
                                                                                                               Advanis reign faces questions 
          SANJAY K. JHA                          Advani: Letter lash                                  
	New Delhi, June 1: A BJP veteran with Sangh links has raised questions in writing about L.K. Advanis continuance as leader of the Opposition, possibly articulating concerns in the parivar and the party.        
	Deepening the buzz in the BJP, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh today chose to receive separate reports on the poll results from Advani and party president Rajnath Singh.        
	Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat summoned the two leaders separately, a move to which party sources attached great significance.         
	They said Bhagwat wanted to know both viewpoints in the party before drawing a road map for the future.        
	One of the views is that the election campaign, managed by Advanis aides and Arun Jaitley, was completely detached from the party apparatus. Many senior party leaders feel that any attempt to cover up mistakes would harm the BJPs long-term interests.        
	Sangh veteran and Rajya Sabha member Pyarelal Khandelwal gave voice to this opinion in a letter to the BJP leadership, written to say he would not attend the parliamentary party meeting held on Sunday.        
	Sources said the ailing Khandelwal wrote he was not opposed to any individual but felt compelled to raise certain fundamental issues. His main concern was the manner in which Advani was declared leader of the Opposition without a regular discussion at any party forum.        
	Khandelwal requested the leadership to assess the gains and losses of this hasty decision and asked that his letter be read out at the parliamentary party meeting. Officially, the letter got buried but some leaders chose to leak its contents.        
	Many in the Sangh and the BJP are wary of a secret plan to continue with the status quo, with Advani at the helm, for much longer than initially thought.        
	Sources said Bhagwat today questioned both Rajnath and Advani on future courses of action, including the appointments of the partys deputy leader in the Lok Sabha and leader in the Rajya Sabha.        
	While Sushma Sawaraj is expected to become deputy leader in the Lok Sabha, there is no clarity about the Rajya Sabha so far.        
	The BJP faces another problem. Its plans to nominate a woman, Sumitra Mahajan, for the post of Lok Sabha Deputy Speaker seem to have got derailed after the Congress took the lead in playing the gender card and picked Meira Kumar as Speaker.        
	The BJP leadership has now decided to review its choice since it does not want to seem to be following in the Congresss footsteps.        
	However, aware of the importance of symbolism, the party wants to pick a Dalit, tribal or Other Backward Classes candidate. Karia Munda, Ramesh Bains and Hukumdeo Narain Yadav are being considered. Munda is a tribal leader from Jharkhand; Bains is from Chhattisgarh.

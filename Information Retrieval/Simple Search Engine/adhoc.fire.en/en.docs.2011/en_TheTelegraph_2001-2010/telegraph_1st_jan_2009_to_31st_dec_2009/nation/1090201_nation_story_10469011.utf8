The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pranab to visit Dhaka
                                                                                                               Pranab to visit Dhaka
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 31: Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee will travel to Dhaka on February 9 on a visit aimed at strengthening ties with Bangladeshs Sheikh Hasina government.        
	The trip will mainly help him understand the steps the new Hasina regime, perceived as being friendly to India, plans to take to improve ties with New Delhi, but many other issues of mutual interest could also be discussed.         
	The visit could lead to the announcement of a joint counter-terrorism group Dhaka has already proposed, government sources said. We are hopeful that this new group will effectively tackle terrorism. The Bangladesh government wants to raise certain economic issues and we hope to take care of that as well, said a government official.        
	The visit could coincide with a Bangladesh court ruling on a plea for political asylum by Ulfa leader Anup Chetia, whose detention ended in December. India has said it will intensify efforts to extradite him. Pranab is likely to seek cooperation in fighting terror and action against leaders of Northeast militant groups hiding in Bangladesh.

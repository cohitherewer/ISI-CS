          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 1: When Devendra Nath Dwivedi was appointed Gujarat governor on July 18, even his detractors in the Congress agreed it was time to pull him out of the doghouse.        
	Overjoyed, Dwivedi told journalists he had never imagined he would get such a position of honour in the sunset of my life and that too a state as important as Gujarat.         
	More to the point that Soniaji (Sonia Gandhi) believed that I deserved it. This makes the honour more worthy.        
	He said he would take the oath of office on July 23 and looked forward to interacting with a large cross-section of Gujarats civil society so that he could view the state through a fresh prism.        
	Two days later, Dwivedi was hospitalised for an infection he got when he was given a blood transfusion a couple of months after an internal haemorrhage, triggered by an overdose of painkillers.         
	His condition worsened. He died on Saturday morning, shortly before Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh was to call on him. He was 74.         
	The irony could not have been crueller.         
	The soft-spoken Dwivedi, regarded as one of the few cerebral Congressmen, worked out of a little space tucked away in a corner of the partys Akbar Road headquarters, hoping all the while he would be transported to a better place and given a weightier position than just being a permanent invitee to the Congress Working Committee (CWC).        
	Although the CWC is the partys highest policy-making body, a members importance is commensurate with his designation and those like Dwivedi came fairly low in the pecking order.         
	But because of his political perspicacity and articulation that Sonia Gandhi recognised and acknowledged with time, he often spoke at length on the issues of the day and the others heard him out in silence.        
	Dwivedis proximity to P.V. Narasimha Rao was his bane, although it was Indira Gandhi who brought him from Varanasi, his home town, to the Rajya Sabha.        
	Dwivedi was mentored by Kamlapati Tripathi, one of the most formidable Congress leaders of his time.         
	He would often say his life-long commitment to secularism was inspired by Tripathi, one of the few Congressmen to oppose the BJPs Ram temple agenda without fear of antagonising Hindus.        
	Dwivedi was part of a clutch of thinking Congressmen who included Rao and Pranab Mukherjee. With them, he set up the Saturday Club at the capitals India International Centre as an informal forum that would open his party colleagues eyes and mind to the world outside through weekly interactions with academics.        
	When Rao became the Prime Minister, Dwivedi, a lawyer by education and training, was made an additional solicitor-general. He later became a Congress general secretary.        
	Once Rao was ousted and Sitaram Kesri was in, Dwivedi fell by the wayside. He joined Sharad Pawars NCP in 1999 and became a general secretary and the partys chief spokesperson. But not seeing much of a future for a heartland Brahmin in a Maharashtra party, he left the NCP in 2001.        
	He returned to the Congress in 2003 but the homecoming was far from hospitable. It was not the association with Pawar but his proximity to Rao that made Dwivedi a suspect in the Sonia-led dispensation.        
	The Prime Minister had a soft spot for him as Dwivedi was among the first in the Congress to bat for the nuclear deal in a lucid and informed way without enmeshing his arguments in anti-Left rhetoric.        
	Dwivedi said he was going to Gandhinagar not to hold a high constitutional office but as a student of political history and sociology.         
	Destiny deemed otherwise.

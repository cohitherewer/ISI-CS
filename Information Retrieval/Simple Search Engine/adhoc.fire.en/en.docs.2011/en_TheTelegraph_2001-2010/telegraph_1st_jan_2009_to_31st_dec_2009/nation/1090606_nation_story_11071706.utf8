	New Delhi, June 5: The US state department yesterday sanctioned a $106,000 grant to an Indian NGO for Muslim women when President Barack Obama was seeking a new beginning in Americas relationship with followers of Islam in Cairo.        
	The grant was given also to non-government organisations in four other countries  Azerbaijan, Egypt, Pakistan and the Philippines.         
	Called the One Woman Initiative (OWI), the US scheme was envisages empowering women in countries with significant Muslim populations.         
	The grant, more than $500,000 in total, is the first such step by the US state department.         
	The OWI, set up last year, makes grants available to organisations with programmes to provide women access to legal rights, political participation and economic development.         
	Karnatakas Group for Urban and Rural Development (Guard) was selected for the grant. It will receive the $106,000 to provide Muslim women greater access to entrepreneurship training and jobs. Indias grant was lesser only than the Philippines.         
	Muslims receiving funds from the US was something looked down upon till now. But with Obama everything seems to have changed, said Sultan Ahmed, who works for Guard.         
	The OWI is supported by the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the US state department and leading private sector groups.         
	Guard works with five grassroots NGOs to disseminate information on Muslim womens rights under the Quran and the Constitution. It implements its programme through 700 self-help groups, 566 of which are womens groups.         
	Guard wants to develop an economic enhancement activity plan to further empower Muslim women. The steps will include building the capacity of womens groups to provide entrepreneurship training and linking the groups to available support agencies and government programmes for economic development.         
	Magbassa Kita Foundation Inc. in the Philippines will receive $124,500.

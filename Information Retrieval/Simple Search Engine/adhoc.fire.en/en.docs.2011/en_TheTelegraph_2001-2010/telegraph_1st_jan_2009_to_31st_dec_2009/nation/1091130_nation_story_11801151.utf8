          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	Patna, Nov. 29: Muskan brought real muskan (smile) on the faces of her poor parents Rajo Majhi and Munni, when they received a UTI mutual fund certificate thanks to her.        
	The certificate will be worth Rs 25,000 when Muskan turns 17. The UTI mutual fund certificate is being given to BPL cardholders for rearing a girl child under the Mukhyamantri Kanyadan Yojana. The scheme will help parents get their daughters educated or marry them off when they become adults.        
	Rajo and Munni happened to be in the first lot of families in Patna to benefit from the Mukhyamantri Kanyadan Yojana.        
	Patna district magistrate Jitendra Kumar said that at least 6,445 families in the district alone had been given UTI mutual fund certificates since chief minister Nitish Kumar launched this scheme for the poor early this year.        
	The government gathers information about the birth of girl children through the anganwadi service centres and subsequently the officials concerned hands over the UTI mutual fund certificates to the families.        
	The government has been executing the Mukhyamantri Kanyadan Yojana in co-operation with UTI in the state. Bihar is among many states where the male-female ratio is not impressive. Among poor families, female foeticide is common.         
	The scheme is being implemented to protect the girl child in the state.

                                                                                                               Showers lessen Bihar drought threat
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Sept. 7: Heavy rain across Bihar in the past two days has decreased the drought threat in 26 districts.        
	The showers have also lifted farmers spirits, who were living with the fear that they may have to face a situation similar to the 1967 famine.        
	The rain will also saved paddy saplings and the kharif crop that was planted in June and July.        
	Bihar had recorded 62 per cent less rain than usual in July, which had affected paddy planting process in 50 per cent of the farmlands.        
	The current spell has improved the situation and now Bihar is facing 26 per cent less rain, said Met experts.        
	Acting director of the Met office S.I. Laskar said that a deep depression had formed 100km north of Jamshedpur bringing heavy rain to Bihar.        
	The state will keep on witnessing heavy to moderate rain in days to follow, he said, adding: Patna alone recorded 29mm of rain yesterday evening.         
	Agriculture experts say that if the state recorded rains in Hathia nakshatra (a sub-season in monsoon) it will get rid of the draught threat to a great extent.         
	The Poorva nakshatra is currently underway and will be followed by hathia, which will last for another fortnight.        
	The rain will also prove to be a boon for rabi crops which will be sown in November and December.        
	Battling with the drought, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh demanding a package of Rs 14,000 crore for farmers.         
	The rain, if it continues till hathiya nakshatra, says the agriculture department, will lessen the burden on the chief minister.         
	Rain in the last leg of monsoon will benefit paddy and rabi crops, besides providing a boost to kharif crops, said S.S. Singh, a scientist at the Central Agricultural Research Council.

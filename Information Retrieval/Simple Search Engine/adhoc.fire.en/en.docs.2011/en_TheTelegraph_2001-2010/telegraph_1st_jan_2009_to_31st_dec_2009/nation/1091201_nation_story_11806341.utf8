The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sleuths question uninvited Salahis

                                        Secret Service chief Mark Sullivan (top), and Michaele Salahi                            
	Washington, Nov. 30: As part of a broadening inquiry into presidential security, Secret Service agents have interviewed the Virginia couple who sneaked into the White House state dinner last week, a senior federal official has said.        
	The interviews, which took place on Friday and Saturday, were conducted in a neutral location, neither the home of the couple, Michaele and Tareq Salahi, nor the Secret Services downtown offices, the official said. He would not comment on the content of the interviews or their length.        
	The Secret Service is also examining its own procedures in the light of the security lapse in the White House. The director of the Secret Service, Mark Sullivan, testified in March before the House Appropriations Committees subcommittee on homeland security that his agency was adapting to the Obama presidency, but he focused on how President Obama was likely to draw larger crowds than his predecessor.        
	Sullivan referred obliquely to Obama as the first African-American President, making note of the historical significance of the election as a reason the agency was especially concerned about providing appropriate security.        
	Exactly how the Salahis infiltrated Obamas state dinner for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh continued to preoccupy the capital and the country on Sunday, with no substantive details emerging.        
	The Secret Service is considering bringing charges against the Salahis, the senior federal official said, but the investigation is on. There are more interviews to do, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the continuing inquiry.        
	A former White House press secretary, Dana Perino, predicted a tough time for the White House social office as the holiday parties approached.        
	Perino, a press secretary in the Bush administration, said on Fox News Sunday With Chris Wallace that once the Salahis were on the White House grounds, the social office might have played a role in processing them through the receiving line.        
	What will be a concern for, I think, the social office going forward is they have their busiest season coming up, Perino said. Its the holiday season. Theyll have a lot of people coming through.        
	The Secret Services Office of Professional Responsibility is conducting interviews in the case, and a spokesperson for the agency, Jim Mackin, said that it would be at least Wednesday before the Secret Service would have anything to say. There will be a written report, Mackin said, but it probably will not be made public.        
	Mackin said a top-to-bottom review of the agencys protective department was ordered shortly after Obama began his term amid the highest threat level for any recent President.         
	Security experts called the breach an indefensible breakdown that will almost certainly lead to changes within the Secret Service. A source who had spoken to senior Secret Service officials said the Salahis were allowed inside in violation of agency policies by an officer outside the front gate who apparently was persuaded by the couples manner and insistence and the pressure of keeping lines moving on a rainy evening. Rather than stand there and get wet, he went ahead and let them go.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, Sept. 9: A Kalinga Nagar land scam exposed last month is proving to be an embarrassment for the state with an administrative probe confirming that land ownership records were fudged.        
	Jajpur collector Dhiren Das confirmed that Duburi revenue inspector Narahari Mahanta was placed under suspension for his involvement in the case.        
	Further investigation undertaken by Jajpur sub-collector S. Dwivedi has also revealed fudging of records, converting forested areas to agriculture land, a process that supposedly involved several revenue officials. Around 27.64 acres under Dhaqnurjayapur and Jampasi mauza of Danagadi tehsil were tampered with.        
	Using false documents, one Manmath Sil, a resident of Vyasanagar, was shown to be the owner of sal forests, which were later sold off to Sitaram D., the owner of an Andhra Pradesh firm.         
	The sales deed validated by the tehsildar labelled the land as biali, used for agriculture. Revenue of Rs 8.11 lakh was charged for the transfer and the amount was deposited to the exchequer.        
	Das ordered a probe after receiving a complaint that alleged forestland was being sold to private companies and that the illegal transaction was worth Rs 1 crore. The scam came to the fore after locals found labourers clearing apiece of sal forests.        
	Meanwhile, 1,270 cases have been received by the administration and the collector has cancelled over 500 leases.

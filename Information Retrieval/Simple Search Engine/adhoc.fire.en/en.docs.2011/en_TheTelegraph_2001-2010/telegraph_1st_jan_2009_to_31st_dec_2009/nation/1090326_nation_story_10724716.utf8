          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              Lalu, Mulayam: Poll axis				                                       
	New Delhi, March 25: Lalu Prasad and Mulayam Singh Yadav, who have both failed to seal an alliance with the Congress, could campaign for each other in the coming elections.        
	The RJD chief said in Patna he would go to Uttar Pradesh to campaign for the Samajwadi Party. Mulayam Singh Yadavji will also visit Bihar and Jharkhand to campaign for our nominees, he added.        
	Samajwadi leader Amar Singh said Lalu Prasad had spoken to him on the phone and offered to campaign for Mulayam even if he put up candidates against the RJD.        
	If Laluji comes to UP, we will also go to Bihar, Amar said. We also want to invite Ram Vilas Paswan to be with us, he added.         
	Amar blew hot and cold at the Congress. On one occasion, he said the Samajwadis and the Congress were made for each other and that no secular government was possible without Mulayam and Sonia Gandhi. On another, he said no one could keep Lalu Prasad and Mulayam out of the heartland.         
	The Congress is contesting both parties.        
	By coming together, the Yadav leaders are hoping to increase their bargaining power with the Congress after the elections. Lalu Prasad and Mulayam are also hoping to be able to consolidate Yadav votes.         
	The Samajwadis cannot join hands with the BJP for fear of losing their minority votes nor can they team up with the Left as long as Mayavati is part of the third front. That leaves the Congress we are made for each other, Amar said, adding the party had left for the Congress the Rae Bareli and Amethi seats as promised and two more  Mathura and Ghaziabad.        
	The Samajwadi and Congress talks failed after the two sides could not agree on the number of seats each should contest.        
	Like Lalu Prasad, the Samajwadi Party is training its guns on Congress leaders but keeping Sonia out of its line of fire.         
	Paswan, however, has been wary of talking loudly against the Congress.

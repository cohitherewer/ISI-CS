          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 3: Cashew in Orissa may soon get an organic tag.        
	Cashew in Dhenkanal and Koraput districts are grown mostly in hilly terrain with farmers rarely using any chemical fertilisers or pesticides.        
	To help improve marketing of this product, the Orissa State Cashew Development Corporation has identified a couple of plantations for organic certification.        
	A certifying agency is already working on the formalities, horticulture director J.D. Sharma said at a national seminar on cashew development in India, enhancement of production and productivity here.        
	At present, cashew plantation has been taken up over 1,40,000 hectares in the state. Of these, 30,000 hectares belong to the corporation.        
	The corporation has set up 13 high-quality cashew clonal nurseries with annual production of 16 to 20 lakh high-yield cashew grafts that are being supplied to Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Tripura, Andhra Pradesh and Bengal. We have set a target of covering 10,000 hectares under cashew plantation by the end of 2015, said agriculture secretary U.P. Singh, adding that the state occupied third position after Andhra and Maharashtra in cashew production and area under cultivation in the country.        
	However, cashew production in the state has not gone up much during the past few years. The average production is 865 tonnes per annum against the national average if 900 tonnes.        
	About 10,000 hectares of land where cashew was grown by the corporation was affected by salinity, agriculture minister Damador Rout said, adding that the lands needed to be rejuvenated.        
	Moreover, most of the cashew plantations in Orissa were taken up about 50 years ago and the plants have grown old. More private players should venture into this kind of plantation, he said.        
	Meanwhile, the state government is also thinking to use the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) to boost cashew plantation. In the recent past, substantial area expansion has taken place by taking funds from the MGNREGA. The state government has chalked out a programme for substantial area expansion in coming years, engaging funds from the scheme, Singh said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong, an ally favourite
                                                                                                               Cong, an ally favourite
          NALIN VERMA                               
	Patna, Oct. 27: Six months after receiving the cold shoulder from RJD-LJP combination during the Bihar Lok Sabha polls, Congress is now being wooed by so-called secular parties across Bihar and Jharkhand.        
	The RJD-LJP combination in Bihar and the JMM and Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM) of Babulal Marandi in Jharkhand are believed to be eager to tie the knot with Indias oldest party, reduced to playing second fiddle once in the states.        
	Congresss New Delhi sources believe that they might make adjustments with certain like-minded regional parties, but not at the cost of compromising on its seat quota or quest to establish its identity in the neighbouring states. During the Lok Sabha polls, RJD rebuffed Congress overtures and spared the party only three seats in Bihar. A smarting Congress decided to contest on all 40 seats. That humiliation has translated into a blessing in disguise for the Congress. That humiliation fired us to contest on all seats and led us to rediscover our strength, said BPCC chief Anil Sharma talking to The Telegraph.         
	Of late, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has been attacking Congress describing it as a clandestine ally of RJD-LJP combination.         
	The BPCC chief turned tables today by stating that Lalu and Nitish were hand in glove in the state.         
	They (Lalu, Paswan and Nitish) captured power in Bihar in the Nineties by driving the Congress out. Now, Nitishs survival lies in keeping Lalu and his concept of jungle raj alive in the citizens minds. Nitish wishes to state that RJD-LJP combination is the states only other option, but the state has yet another option, our party, Sharma said.        
	Once Lalu is finished politically, Nitish, too, will lose his reason to stay in power as he clings on to an anti-Lalu plank. The Congress would be directly benefited as secular votes would shift to Congress, Sharma added.

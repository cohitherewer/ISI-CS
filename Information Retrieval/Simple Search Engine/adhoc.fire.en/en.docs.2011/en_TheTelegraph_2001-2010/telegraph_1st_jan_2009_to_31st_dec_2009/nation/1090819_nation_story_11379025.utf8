          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Aug. 18: Payments for an Internet telephony account used by the handlers of the 26/11 terrorists were made from Pakistan, an American witness brought in by the FBI told the special court today.        
	The American national, who owns Callphonex, a New Jersey-based company that provides Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services for Net telephony, told the court he had received an email from one Kharak Singh on October 20, 2008, seeking to subscribe to some VoIP accounts on a wholesale basis.         
	Although the mail identified Singh as an Indian interested in reselling the VoIP facilities in India, the first pre-payment of $250 was wire transferred from Pakistan, said the witness, deposing via video conferencing from a hotel in Canada where he has gone on a holiday.        
	The identity of the witness has been kept secret on court orders.        
	We had provided them with three facilities, including 15 calls from computer to phone, 10 calls to common client accounts and direct inward dialling, he said while being examined by special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam.         
	The witness, born in Palestine who now holds US citizenship, said the usage of the VoIP accounts subscribed to by Singh was low initially, but it increased sharply days before the November 26 attacks and during the four-day siege.         
	Nikam told the court that the conspirators had made nearly 150 test calls between November 24 and 26 to check the sound quality.         
	Since Indians and Pakistani nationals have relatives in respective countries, I thought the money might have been sent by Singhs relative in Pakistan, the witness said, explaining why he did not initially doubt Kharak Singhs identity.         
	He said he had suspicions about Singhs identity after the second payment for the VoIP subscriptions was also made from Pakistan, but he did not deactivate the services for professional reasons.                     
	He said he became aware that the VoIP facility was being misused for terror attacks only after FBI sleuths questioned him.        
	The witness said there was no procedure to verify details provided by a customer seeking VoIP subscriptions before the 26/11 attacks. A procedure has now been laid down to ensure that the technology is not misused.        
	The witness is the fourth American who has reaffirmed Indias claim that the terror strikes were plotted on Pakistani soil.         
	Earlier, representatives of Nokia Inc and Yamaha Motor Corp from the US had deposed before the court stating that five mobile phones and a motor attached to the inflatable dinghy used by the 26/11 attackers were purchased in Pakistan.         
	The prosecution will also examine a special agent of the FBI who had carried out parallel investigations during and after the attacks.

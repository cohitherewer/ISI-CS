The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nun murder bail 
                                                                                                               Nun murder bail 
                            
	Thiruvananthapuram, Jan. 1: Kerala High Court has granted bail to all three accused in the Sister Abhaya murder case, observing that the probe had gone off the track and derailed.         
	A large crowd of supporters greeted Father Thomas M. Kottoor, Father Jose Puthrukayil and Sister Sephy when they were released after 42 days in custody.         
	But Justice K. Hema, while granting the bail plea, bound the accused by stringent conditions, including cancellation of bail if they made or received phone calls.         
	The three were arrested on November 19 in connection with the 16-year-old murder of Abhaya, an inmate of St Pius X Convent, Kottayam.         
	The CBI, which has changed its version several times, holds that Sister Sephy hit the victim with a small axe and all three dumped her in a well.         
	Investigation means carefully examining the facts. It is not to fix the target first and then hunt for evidence, Justice Hema said.

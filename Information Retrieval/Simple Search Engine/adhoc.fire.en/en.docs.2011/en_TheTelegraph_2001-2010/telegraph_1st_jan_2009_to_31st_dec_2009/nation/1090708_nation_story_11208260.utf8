The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | IIM plan for four states
                                                                                                               IIM plan for four states
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, July 7: Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Haryana and Tamil Nadu will receive Indian Institutes of Management in the first phase of plans to start seven new IIMs, junior human resource development minister Daggubati Purandeswari told Parliament today.         
	The announcement means that Uttarakhand, Jammu and Kashmir and Rajasthan may have to wait longer for the IIMs promised to them.        
	Under the Eleventh Five Year Plan, IIMs were assured to Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir and Meghalaya.         
	Of these, an IIM was started in Shillong last year.         
	Earlier this year, in an interim budget speech blooper by Pranab Mukherjee, first reported by The Telegraph on February 17, the Union government unintentionally announced an IIM for Rajasthan, too. With Lok Sabha elections on the horizon, the Union government agreed to also start an IIM in Rajasthan, adding to the six other IIMs in the pipeline.         
	The HRD ministry is at present preparing itself to present the proposal for the seven new IIMs to the cabinet.        
	Once the cabinet approval is obtained, the government can launch the institutions.

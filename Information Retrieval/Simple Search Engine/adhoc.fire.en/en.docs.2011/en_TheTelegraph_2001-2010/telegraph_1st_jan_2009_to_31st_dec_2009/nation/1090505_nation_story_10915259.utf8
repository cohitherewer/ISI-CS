The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Stalwarts on shaky ground
                                                                                                               Stalwarts on shaky ground
          NALIN VERMA                                     
	Patna, May 4: The biggest battle in the final lap of Bihars poll will be between Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan combination on one side and Sharad Yadav (JD-U) on the other.        
	The three stalwarts have two things in common: all three are bosses of their respective parties and are facing rough weather for now.         
	The battle to become the MP is nearly over for Ram Vilas Paswan and Sharad Yadav, as their seats  Hajipur and Madhepura  from which the LJP and the JD(U) bosses were contesting have gone to the polls already. For the RJD boss, contesting on two seats, the war is half-way through. While in Saran election is over, Pataliputra seat goes to the poll on May 7.         
	Sharad Yadav who was trounced by Lalu Prasad in Madhepura in 2004 is not quite sure of victory this time around.         
	Reason: a majority of the Yadavs, the numerically preponderant community in Madhepura, has been leaning heavily towards RJD-sponsored candidate and local boy Ravindra Charan Yadav. Aware of trend turn, the JD(U) boss was banking on Brahmins, Rajputs and Extremely Backward Castes (EBCs) who has been considering Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar as a new favourite.         
	But, to the misfortune of the JD(U) president, this time the delimitation commission added two Brahmin dominated segments  Mehsi and Saharas in Madhepura  and excluded two Yadav-dominated ones, changing the demographic profile of his seat.        
	Adding to this worry, Congress for the first time in 15 years fielded a Brahmin candidate in Tarananad Sada, offering a strong option to the Brahmins to return to the Congress  a party the caste had supported prior to the Nineties. An influential Rajput MLA from Sonbarsa joined the fray as an Independent cutting into the Rajput votes further.         
	In a way the JD(U) stalwart has been left depending on EBCs faith on Nitish Kumar to hit the parliaments portal.         
	For Lalu, too, the road has been rough. Due to a decision-making delay, Congress failed to field its candidate against Lalu Prasad in Saran.         
	But, his biggest challenge came from BSPs Saleem Pervez there. Now, Pervez holds the key to Lalus victory in Saran.        
	In the Yadav-dominated Pataliputra Lalu faces friend-turned-foe Ranjan Yadav, a battle that Nitish Kumar has made a prestige issue. The RJD boss is depending on the Muslim-Yadav combination, while JD(U) nominee is sure of the EBCs and upper caste votes.         
	Admittedly, LJP chief Paswan faced hostile voters in Hajipur due to his party hopping. He had a former Bihar chief minister Ram Sunder Das against him.

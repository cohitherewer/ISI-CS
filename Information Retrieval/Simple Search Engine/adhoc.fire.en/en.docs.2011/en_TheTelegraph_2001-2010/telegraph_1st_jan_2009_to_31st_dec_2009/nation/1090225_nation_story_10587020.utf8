The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Renuka pub fury at panel member
                                                                                                               Renuka pub fury at panel member
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           Renuka: Sack move                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 24: Renuka Chowdhury has written to the Prime Minister recommending sacking National Commission for Women member Nirmala Venkatesh, accusing her of failing in her duty while investigating last months attack on women at a Mangalore pub.         
	Venkatesh should be removed from her post as member of Indias apex government panel for womens concerns, the women and child development (WCD) minister said in her letter last week, The Telegraph has learnt.         
	If Manmohan Singh accepts the ministers recommendation, it would be the first instance of a member being removed from her post on disciplinary grounds in the 17-year history of the NCW.         
	Chowdhurys move comes after Venkatesh wrote a defiant reply to a WCD ministry notice, stating that she stands by her inquiry report where she controversially suggested that the attacked girls were inappropriately dressed.         
	Venkateshs name was suggested for the NCW post in 2005 by Congress president Sonia Gandhi.         
	The NCW is officially an autonomous body, but its chairperson and members are appointed by a central government committee headed by the Prime Minister.         
	Refusal to act (according to a given mandate) is one of the conditions listed in this clause, and Chowdhury, it is learnt, has cited this clause in her note to the Prime Minister.         
	Venkatesh was given the task of inquiring into the assault on the women in Mangalore, and she visited the coastal Karnataka city in January end.         
	But in comments to a television channel before submitting her report, Venkatesh suggested that the pub owner was responsible for the incident as he did not hold a liquor licence and did not have adequate security.         
	She did not meet any of the victims and in her report said that while the men who attacked the women should be punished, factors including the nude dresses of the women needed to be considered.         
	Chowdhury publicly objected to Venkateshs comments, which she said were on matters beyond the NCWs mandate. The commission, the minister argued, was not set up to examine the legality of serving drinks at a particular pub, but to ensure the safety and security of women.         
	Venkateshs report was rejected publicly by NCW member Girija Vyas at a news conference on February 5, and the WCD minister issued a show cause notice to Venkatesh.         
	Asked about the notice, Venkatesh had questioned Chowdhurys authority on NCW matters.         
	The notice initially asked for a response within 48 hours but Venkatesh was subsequently given time till early last week after she asked for an extension, sources said.         
	The notice, sources said, asked Venkatesh to explain why she insulted the minister, why she did not meet the victims in Mangalore and why she strayed from her mandate and commented on the legality of the pub.                     
	Venkatesh in her response has said she did not insult Chowdhury, but has maintained her defiance.         
	Her reply to the notice specifically mentions that does not care if the NCW rubbishes her report but that she continues to stand by her findings.

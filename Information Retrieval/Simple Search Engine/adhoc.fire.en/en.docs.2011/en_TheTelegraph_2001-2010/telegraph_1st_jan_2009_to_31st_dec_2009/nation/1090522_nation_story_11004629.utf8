The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | America approves Pak aid bill, drops India
                                                                                                               America approves Pak aid bill, drops India
                            Obama                            
	Washington, May 21 (PTI): A key US Congressional committee today approved a law that triples Americas annual non-military aid to Pakistan to $1.5 billion but appeared to water down the condition that Islamabad not let its soil be used for terror attacks on India.        
	The House foreign affairs committee approved the Pakistan Enduring Assistance and Co-operation Enhancement (Peace) Act 2009, but replaced the word India with neighbouring countries in relation to Pakistan not allowing the use of its territory to launch terror attacks.        
	The change was made apparently at the suggestion of the Obama administration after Pakistan raised objections, Congressional observers said, adding the bills meaning still remained virtually the same. They said India had to be deleted because the Obama administration had told lawmakers this could be counter-productive.         
	While the original bill asked the US President to give a presidential determination about the progress Pakistan had made in preventing cross-border attacks on India, Peace seeks an account of the progress by Islamabad over intrusion into neighbouring countries.         
	The bill seeks to bar the Pakistan military or intelligence from supporting any extremist or terrorist group.        
	It also asks Islamabad to provide direct access to Pakistani nationals connected with proliferation networks. The bill will now go to the House of Representatives for passage.

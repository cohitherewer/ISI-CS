	New Delhi, Dec. 23: Next time you are planning to walk into a restaurant in the capital, better carry a bullet-proof jacket.        
	Police today booked an Uttar Pradesh MLAs son for opening fire inside a bar in south Delhi after a row with the manager.        
	Delhi police officials said Vivek, son of BSP legislator Chandra Veer Singh, walked into Mocha, an upscale bar-cum-restaurant, around 11.45 this morning and demanded to speak to the manager. With him were his wife and sister who claimed she had left her purse in the restaurant last night.        
	Additional commissioner (south-east) Virender Singh said Viveks sister met the manager while Vivek and his wife waited outside in their car. When the manager showed her the CCTV footage of last night and assured her that she didnt leave anything behind, she got angry. She insisted the manager call the staff who were on duty last night. She later went outside and told her brother, the officer said.        
	He came in and after a brief scuffle with the manager fired at him, but missed and hit a wooden plank. We have registered a case of attempt to murder against him.        
	Singh said the two women had been detained for questioning, while Vivek was absconding. Later this evening, Vivek surrendered. Around 7.30, he walked into a police station accompanied by his father, after which he was arrested.        
	Chandra Veer Singh, MLA from Sardhana, Meerut, denied that his son had fired at the manager. My son was there at the restaurant with his sister and wife for lunch. There was an altercation when some people misbehaved with the ladies. There was no firing involved, he said over phone from Meerut.        
	Police officer Singh, too, had initially denied reports of firing inside the restaurant but conceded later that Vivek had indeed shot at the manager.        
	Sources in the police department said what was disconcerting was that Vivek could walk into Mocha in the crowded Satyam Cinema complex with a gun in his pocket without being stopped by the metal detectors at the gate.

                                                                                                               Pak border build-up
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 22: The Pakistan Army is massing troops along a stretch of the border in Rajasthans Jaisalmer considered strategically advantageous for India, BSF officials have said.        
	The build-up comes at a time when Islamabad has promised to look into Indias dossier of evidence in the Mumbai attacks and promised co-operation in the probe.        
	Security experts refer to the area as the bulge, since the international border at this point juts into Pakistani territory.         
	The Pakistani army is concerned about three specific threats: to the Indus flowing across the other side, to an arterial road connecting its Punjab and Sindh provinces and to an important railway line going to Sindh.        
	The deployments are being stepped up because of concerns that if India attacks, Sindh can be cut off completely, a BSF official said. The Karachi port, too, will become idle if the links snap.

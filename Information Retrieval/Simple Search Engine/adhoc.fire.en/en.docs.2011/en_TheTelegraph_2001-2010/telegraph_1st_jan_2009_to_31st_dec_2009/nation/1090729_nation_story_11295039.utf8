	New Delhi, July 28: The Centre today rejected a demand for a special law to deal with honour killings, saying these must be treated as murders and that society needed to be educated to stop the practice, reports our special correspondent.        
	Home minister P. Chidambaram, however, told the Rajya Sabha the Centre was willing to see if such crimes could be defined separately in law, and if the marriage act needed changes.

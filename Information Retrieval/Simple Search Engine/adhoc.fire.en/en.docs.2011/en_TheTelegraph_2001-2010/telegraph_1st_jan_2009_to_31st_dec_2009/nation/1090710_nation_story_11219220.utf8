The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Law hurdle to Mamata IIT
                                                                                                               Law hurdle to Mamata IIT
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, July 9: Mamata Banerjees plan to build an Indian Institute of Technology for the benefit of children of railway employees is riddled with technical loopholes that may render the proposal a non-starter, senior education officials cautioned today.         
	Responding to a debate on the rail budget in the Lok Sabha, the Trinamul Congress chief today said the railways might look to build an IIT among initiatives to improve opportunities for its employees and their wards.         
	Land is our main asset. We can build medical colleges and other institutions on our land. Both railway employees and the general public will benefit from this. We might even look at building IITs in the future, the railway minister said.         
	But unlike other medical colleges and institutions that the railways set up and which can reserve seats for wards of railway staff, an IIT cannot offer special benefits to these students under the IIT act.         
	The act  which applies to all IITs  requires the premier engineering schools to follow identical admission policies.         
	So, any new IIT that comes up will have to follow the admission policies of the 15 existing IITs, which do not allow any seat reservation on the basis of the occupation of a students parents.         
	The IITs are bound by the Constitution to follow government reservations for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes but quota demands for other sections have been turned down  including demands from the President.         
	On March 12, 2008, The Telegraph was the first to report President Pratibha Patils request for an IIT exclusively for women in her former Lok Sabha constituency, Amravati.         
	As reported subsequently by this newspaper, the Planning Commission and the Prime Minister vetoed the proposal, arguing that it was contrary to the concept of the IITs as the countrys apex engineering schools.         
	It is hard to imagine that the government will change its law to allow an IIT benefiting a certain employment sector, and its policies regarding what an IIT is aimed at achieving. If the President could not convince the government, it is unlikely that the railway minister will succeed, a senior human resource development ministry official said.         
	Allowing the railway proposal might also fuel similar demands from other government sectors, the official warned.

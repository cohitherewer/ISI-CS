	Patna, Aug. 4: In yet another show of political magnanimity, chief minister Nitish Kumar gave his nod to the selection of BJP veteran and noted lawyer Tarakant Jha, who was elected unopposed today as the chairman of the Bihar legislative council.         
	BJP has 14 MLCs against JD(U)s 30 in the 75-member House.        
	Last week, in his first step towards reconciliation, the Bihar chief minister sent the estranged JD(U) veteran and socialist George Fernandes to Rajya Sabha, despite the latter contesting as a rebel candidate from Muzaffarpur in the last Lok Sabha polls.        
	JD(U) posted an emphatic victory in the recently-concluded legislative council elections taking its tally to 30 in 75 member House. Its ally, BJP, barely had 14 seats leading the observers to speculate that the JD(U) that had gained a near total majority on its own in the upper House, would not let BJP to have its man on the coveted seat.        
	Nitish Kumar has truly honoured the coalition dharma by allowing his numerically weak ally to have its chairman of the council, said a Nitish Kumar supporter. The Assembly has JD(U)s Udai Narayan Choudhary as Speaker. JD(U)s Birendra Kumar Choudhary, too, was elected as deputy Speaker unopposed.         
	Nitish and the leader of the Opposition in the council, Ghulam Ghaus, escorted chairman (Jha) to the chair.        
	You have been a prominent lawyer and constitutional expert. We are sure that you will prove to be a worthy guide for the House, Nitish Kumar said, adding: The ruling NDA legislators will co-operate with you in the House.        
	When it came to seat politics, Tarakant Jha was not the favourite with the BJP general secretary Arun Jaitely-led camp in the faction-ridden party.         
	But, he was said to enjoy the backing of party national president Rajnath Singh which together with Nitishs generosity brought him the position he was yearning for.

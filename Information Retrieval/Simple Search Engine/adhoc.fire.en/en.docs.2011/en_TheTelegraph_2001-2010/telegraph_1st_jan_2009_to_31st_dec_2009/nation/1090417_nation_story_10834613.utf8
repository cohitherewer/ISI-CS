The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Strike at AIIMS heart unit
                                                                                                               Strike at AIIMS heart unit
                            
	New Delhi, April 16 (PTI): The cardiac surgery department of AIIMS today came to a standstill after perfusionists, who operate the heart-lung machine, skipped work demanding better facilities and higher pay.        
	At least 20 heart surgeries, barring an emergency one, could not be carried out at the Cardio Thoracic and Vascular Sciences (CTVS) centre, official sources said.        
	Thirteen perfusionists, excepting the one on emergency surgery duty, stayed away from work.        
	Barring one, all 13 of us are on casual leave for today. This is to protest the fact that our demands are being ignored by the AIIMS administration, a senior perfusionist said.        
	If the chief of the CTVS centre does not pay heed to our demands, we will go in for an indefinite strike after 15 days, he said.        
	CTVS chief Sampath Kumar refused to comment.        
	The perfusionists demands include a separate restroom, a duty roster, stipulated working hours on a par with central government employees, compensation for those on emergency and night duties, and revision of pay scales.        
	A perfusionist is an important person in a cardiothoracic surgical team. He is solely responsible for the circulatory and respiratory functions of the heart-lung machine, an AIIMS doctor said.

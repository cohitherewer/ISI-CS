The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Court snub to Jon
                                                                                                               Court snub to Jon
                            
	Los Angeles, July 8 (PTI): A Los Angeles court has dismissed an appeal for fresh trial by Anand Jon, the Indian-born fashion designer convicted for sexually assaulting upcoming models.         
	Jons lawyers had sought a new trial on the ground that a juror had improperly contacted the designers sister. But the Los Angeles county judge ruled that the jurors contact with the defendants sister before the verdict did not prevent Jon from getting a fair trial.        
	Defence lawyers alleged that juror Alvin Dymally reached out to Jons sister Sanjana twice towards the end of the trial, possibly seeking a date. He voted for a conviction after she refused to meet him alone, the Los Angeles Times has reported.        
	Jon, 35, was convicted on 16 counts of rape and other charges last year after allegations that he lured aspiring models to Los Angeles and sexually assaulted them.        
	After the ruling, prosecutors immediately filed a sentencing memorandum in which they demanded that Jon be imprisoned for the maximum possible under the law  three terms of 53 years and six months to life, the Associated Press said.        
	A teary Sanjana said: Its a travesty of justice. I didnt go meet up alone with him. If I had, this wouldnt be happening.

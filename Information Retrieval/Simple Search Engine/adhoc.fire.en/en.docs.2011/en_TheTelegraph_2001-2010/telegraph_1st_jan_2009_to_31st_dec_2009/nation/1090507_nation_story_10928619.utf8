The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Voice and song on hold
                                                                                                               Voice and song on hold
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          LK Advani and Manmohan Singh smile and greet each other in Parliament during the birth centenary celebrations of Motilal Nehru on Wednesday. On an earlier occasion, the two had refused to look at each other after BJP Prime Minister candidate Advani dubbed Singh the weakest head of government and the Prime Minister alluded to his weeping in a corner during the Babri Masjid demolition. The leaders, however, shook hands in the House today. (PTI)                                   
	New Delhi, May 6: On pause: Congress spokesperson Ashwani Kumar and campaign song Jai ho.        
	Kumar, the junior industry minister in the Union cabinet, has been taken off media briefings after he dubbed the ADMK, Janata Dal (United), Telugu Desam and a few other non-UPA parties secular.        
	The JD (U) is part of the BJP-led NDA. The other two were erstwhile BJP allies.        
	Veerappa Moily, who heads the Congresss media cell, reportedly took a dim view of Kumars description.        
	 Moily felt that Kumar had exceeded his brief and should have confined himself to praising the work of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, not his party JD(U).        
	Rahul Gandhi had picked out Nitish and Naidu for praise yesterday but had steered clear of any references to their parties.        
	Jai ho has been silenced apparently for having failed to click with the masses, though Moily claimed the plan was to run the A.R. Rahman chartbuster from Slumdog Millionaire only for 10 days.        
	But the partys campaign managers said they had received feedback suggesting that the song could go the way of India Shining, the NDAs 2004 campaign theme that flopped.        
	Moily suggested Jai ho was only one of several modules. It was used and that is it, he said, adding he wouldnt like to use the word discarded or abandoned.        
	Moily said the decision not to use the song any more was a sign of a dynamic process that would now focus on the aam aadmi plank.        
	Even the Jai ho campaign starts with the aam aadmi. We did not want the campaign to be static, we wanted it to be dynamic. So we decided to run the Jai ho ad for 10 days. It was decided before the campaign, he said.        
	The party had secured the rights to the lyrics and the tune of the song in March to spice up its campaign.

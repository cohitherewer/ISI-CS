The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | US hangs on to visa alert
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      US hangs on to visa alert

	Washington, Dec. 30: The US is adopting a wait-and-watch approach to amendments made on Christmas Eve to Indias earlier draconian visa rules which portrayed every arriving foreigner as a potential terrorist and will not immediately withdraw its advice to Americans that virtually asked them not to travel to India.         
	According to the US State Departments Bureau of Consular Affairs here, it will wait until January 21, 2010, to reconsider its advice that American travellers are urged to review travel plans in light of these new regulations, which require a gap of two months before they can enter India on a second visit.         
	Britains Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has also determined that recent announcements by the Indian government on visas rules have caused confusion and concern among British visitors.        
	It has warned British citizens of the possibility that as a result of the rules, travellers could be fined and may be prosecuted or detained and later deported.        
	What is worse, the FCO has flagged that single worst nightmare that every traveller to India who has gone through that experience dreads: They may also need to appear in person at the ministry of home affairs in Delhi.        
	Adding to the worries of potential British visitors to India, there is a further warning that its High Commission/Deputy High Commission may not be able to intervene in these cases.        
	On Christmas Eve, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) amended its most recent visa rules and announced that immigration authorities in all the immigration checkposts in India have been authorised to allow tourists to make two or three entries, as the case may be, based on production of an itinerary and documentation (ticket bookings) substantiating the need for tourism related travel.        
	Last month, the government had decided that a two month gap between two visits is mandatory for foreigners holding long-term multi-entry tourist visas for India.         
	This was a knee-jerk reaction by the Union home ministry to the free run that US terrorist David Coleman Headley and his accomplice Tahawwur Hussain Rana enjoyed in India and a response to revelations that not only Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, but also Masood Azhar, head of the Jaish-e-Mohammed, had easily visited India.        
	But the US governments decision to wait for at least a month before reviewing its travel advisory and the British governments continued insistence that Indian authorities are causing confusion and concern among its citizens amount to a declaration of no-confidence in New Delhis ability to manage the current visa tangle.         
	The US insists that Indian authorities are guilty of inconsistent implementation of the new rules and, as the Christmas Eve amendment shows, these rules are are subject to change.        
	Meanwhile, it is understood that the relaxation of last months draconian measures, which invited formal complaints from the British High Commissioner and the US deputy chief of mission in New Delhi in the wake of harassment of their citizens at Indian airports was made at the instance of Shashi Tharoor, the minister of state for external affairs, who had earlier privately expressed doubts about the Union home ministrys decisions.         
	Those chasing the paper trail in the MEA have told this reporter that the ministrys consular, passports and visa (CPV) division submitted a formal proposal to Tharoor on the morning of December 23 for relaxing the visa regulations for arriving foreigners.        
	The next day, MEA announced the proposal of the new rules to be implemented at entry points and at Indian Missions abroad with immediate effect.         
	Consequently, the latest criticism of Tharoor for his tweet on the issue has puzzled officials implementing the Christmas Eve changes.        
	Tharoor is formally in charge of the CPV division, which is the implementing authority for consular and visa rules where the MEA is required to play its part, said one MEA official who is part of the visa process.         
	When MOS-ST (South Block acronym for minister of state Shashi Tharoor) says something about visas, it is policy, because he is in charge. It is not some off-the-cuff tweet. He is the one who decides the MEA part of the visa policy.        
	Unlike on his earlier tweeting controversies, there is widespread support within the MEA over Tharoors latest tweet on visas.        
	One senior South Block official was puzzled by external affairs minister (EAM) S.M. Krishnas public criticism of his deputy yesterday, but did not obviously want to go on record against his minister.         
	The latest changes to visa policy did not even go to EAM. It was handled by MOS-ST. If the EAM does not like what the junior minister is doing, he should take CPV division away from him and then speak. But he should not gag MOS-ST in an area that is directly his job, the official said.

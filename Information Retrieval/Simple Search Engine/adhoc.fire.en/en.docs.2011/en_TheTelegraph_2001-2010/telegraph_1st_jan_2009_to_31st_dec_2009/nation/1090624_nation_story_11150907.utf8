The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP poll penalty, but in hills
                                                                                                               BJP poll penalty, but in hills
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Khanduri in Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, June 23: The BJPs Lok Sabha defeat has claimed a party chief minister with B.C. Khanduri asked to go following the Congresss 5-0 sweep in Uttarakhand.        
	Khanduri, who had offered to quit after the results but was asked to stay on by L.K. Advani, was today told by his Delhi bosses to step down.        
	However, Rajya Sabha MP and former chief minister Bhagat Singh Koshyari, who had been the first to demand Khanduris head, seems to have lost out in the race for the post despite having the blessings of party president Rajnath Singh.        
	Koshyari had resigned his Upper House membership in protest against Khanduris continuance in office but had withdrawn the resignation on Rajnaths advice. He was told that revolt and dissent would not be tolerated by a party looking to put its house in order, sources said.        
	Uttarakhands MLAs will meet here tomorrow to elect Khanduris replacement, possibly Ramesh Pokhriyal or Prakash Pant, who are ministers in the state government.        
	Both Pokhriyal and Pant are in their 50s, while Khanduri is 75 and Koshyari 71. The RSS has asked the BJP to have young leaders wherever possible.        
	Like Khanduri, Pokhriyal and Pant are Brahmins, whom the BJP doesnt want to annoy. Apart from his dissidence, what cost Koshyari was that he is a Thakur. State BJP chief B.S. Rawat too is one and the party did not want to seem too pro-Thakur.        
	Besides, Koshyari and Rawat are from the Kumaon region, and the BJP could not risk being accused of neglecting Garhwal, from where Khanduri and his prospective successors come.        
	Khanduri did not leave before making the point that the Lok Sabha seats were lost not because of poor governance but because of rebellion and dissidence.        
	He told a news conference that although the BJP had bagged only 2,000 votes from the Kalpot segment in the Lok Sabha polls, it had won the subsequent Kalpot Assembly by-election by over 6,000 votes.        
	This proves there was no anger against the state government. We lost because of internal sabotage, he alleged.

  - 20 teams fan out on terror trail, Curb on Rahul Bhatts movements        NISHIT DHOLABHAI AND SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                          TV footage of Headleys picture on his passport                                        
	Nov.16: Indian investigators claim they are inching towards linking alleged Lashkar-e-Toiba operatives David Coleman Headley and Tahawwur Rana to 26/11, knowing that they flew from Mumbai to Pakistan less than a week before the November 26 attack.        
	Establishing a 26/11 connection will help Delhi press its case for their extradition from the US, where the FBI arrested them last month.        
	The duo had travelled to Karachi and Lahore last year and may have shared details of their recce in India with their Lashkar handlers over the email, sources said.        
	Headley and Rana apparently reported to Harkat-ul-Jihadi Islami (Huji) operative Ilyas Kashmiri, who has been linked to 26/11 through intercepts of phone conversations between the Nariman House gunmen and their Pakistani handlers.        
	The duo belonged to the Kashmiri-headed 313 Terror Brigade, whose name first cropped up in these same intercepts, the sources said.        
	The 313 Brigade is a joint platform of Lashkar, Jaish-e-Mohammed and Huji that operates with the single agenda of carrying out terror strikes in India, a National Investigating Agency (NIA) official said.        
	The ISI funds and trains this brigade. The Nariman House tapes mention that the next attack in India would be carried out by the 313 Brigade.        
	According to Headleys emails quoted in the FBI affidavit to a Chicago court, Headley was so close to Kashmiri that he was heart-broken to hear reports of his death in US drone attacks on Pakistans western front.        
	He says in a note to an email group that after Kashmiris demise there was no hope for new operations (in India) any more. He said they were now like a company that had gone bankrupt, the NIA official said. It was later reported that Kashmiri had survived the attacks.        
	Mega hunt        
	More than 20 teams have fanned out across India to unearth Headley and Ranas trail. Headley visited India at least nine times while Rana accompanied him only once but travelled extensively.        
	Sources said that around November 16-17 last year, the duo were in Kochi, allegedly scouting for people interested in going abroad. They are suspected to have recruited youths to set up sleeper cells in target countries.        
	The NIA teams have to get every detail about whom they met in Kochi, Ahmedabad and Mumbai, and who and how many people they sent abroad, a home ministry official said. The hundreds who have met or known Headley need to be found out and questioned Rahul Bhatt (Mahesh Bhatts son) is only one of them.        
	Sleuths claim to have identified all the Indian hotels where the duo checked in last year and are now trying to pinpoint the private homes where they may have stayed.        
	Curb on Rahul        
	The NIA today restricted Rahul Bhatt from moving out of Mumbai. Sources said they were probing whether Rahul, a gym instructor who knew Headley, had accompanied the Pakistani American to places outside Mumbai.        
	We now know they were not just casual acquaintances as his father (Mahesh Bhatt) claims. Rahul did meet Headley through his co-instructor (Vilas) at a gym, but they became friends and Rahul introduced Headley to the sons of a host of Bollywood distributors and producers. They were a close gang of 10-12 who often went pub-hopping, the NIA official said.        
	Rahul has claimed the man he knew as Headley looked different from the passport photograph of the suspect. The Lashkar mans gym form did not have the mandatory photograph. We are trying to find out from the owners why and how this happened, the NIA source said. The NIA and police are searching for 4-5 white men who shared a Breach Candy flat with Headley.         
	Project Mickey        
	On December 7 last year, hours before leaving Pakistan for the US, Headley allegedly used one of his email accounts to store a detailed list of items that he titled Mickey Mouse, the FBI has found. Any Lashkar operative who knew Headleys password could have opened the mailbox. Project Mickey Mouse related to plans for an attack on a Danish newspaper that had published cartoons of the Prophet.        
	An FBI team led by its chief, Robert Mueller, will visit India on Wednesday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Koda effect: graft silence shrouds poll
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Koda effect: graft silence shrouds poll
          SHANTANU DATTA AND SUMAN SHRIVASTAVA                                             
	Ranchi, Nov. 24: Madhu Koda has been drawing huge crowds in the Kolhan region in south Jharkhand. Milking his home-turf advantage dry, the former chief minister is brazen. He mocks his detractors who have put him at the centre of an alleged Rs 2,000-crore scam that has a whiff of everything from hawala to nondescript mines in Liberia.         
	Thanks to the media for making me more popular all for free, he declared in front of a cheering crowd, some of whom perched atop buses that brought them to the Gandhi Maidan in Chaibasa, West Singhbhum.         
	Irrespective of whether the six greenhorns of his fledgling Jharkhand Nav Nirman Morcha win or not, Koda has managed the impossible. He has deftly manoeuvred his campaign to turn a seeming personal disadvantage into a virtue.         
	So, on the eve of the states five-phase Assembly elections beginning on Wednesday, Koda is basking in the glory of having successfully made himself the pivot of this campaign. No matter how much they try, both the Congress and the BJP dont quite know what to do with this adivasi, a former RSS man who is not only undaunted by the nationwide raids on his properties and those of his associates, but displays the gall to attain king-maker status.         
	When Rahul Gandhi came to campaign in Ranchi last week, corruption wasnt part of his discourse. The BJP, too, even though it has come into this election as favourites  it won eight of the states 14 Lok Sabha seats  is wary of going all out to pin down the Congress for having propped up the Koda regime.         
	Mining lease kickbacks, income tax and enforcement directorate officials believe, were one of the ways in which Koda and his clique amassed wealth. But before becoming chief minister in September 2006, Koda was mining minister during BJP chief minister Arjun Mundas tenure from March 2005. Maybe, thats why the BJP has fallen back on the aam aadmi and designed a manifesto that talks of free rice/wheat at Re 1 per kg and farmers loans at 2 per cent interest.         
	The Koda association has forced the Congress to strike an alliance with Babulal Marandi, the most credible face in Jharkhand politics today. His Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM) is contesting 19 of the 81 seats, according to the deal that many believe is the only hope for the Congress to try and shake off the baggage of having supported the inefficient and corrupt regime of Independents.         
	So nervous is it about an emboldened Koda that the Congress is despatching a host of senior leaders to convince the electorate of its good intentions. If the likes of Ajay Maken, a former party in-charge for Jharkhand affairs, went ahead and promised to bring back the money looted from the state if they were voted to power, the Congress leadership failed to showcase the administratively sound tenure of governor Sankaranarayanan.         
	The BJP-Janata Dal (United) alliance on the other hand is time-tested. Initial hiccups on seat-sharing notwithstanding, the NDA combine has more to lose in the first phase of voting for 26 seats, 14 of which are in the Santhal Pargana region where the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) is struggling to retain its hold.         
	Among the 26 seats, the BJP-JD(U) combine has sitting MLAs in 15. It is more concerned about Marandi, once the face of the BJP in Santhal Pargana before he quit in 2006. Realising the JVM has the potential to damage its prospects most, the BJP has gone to the extent of fielding weak candidates (in Jama, Jamtara, both in Santhal Pargana) to make it easier for the JMM.        
	The BJP-JD(U) combine has managed to project a united face. BJP stalwarts like L.K. Advani and Rajnath Singh have campaigned together with the JD(U)s Sharad Yadav and Nitish Kumar. The Congress has had one joint rally by Sonia Gandhi and Marandi in Dumka.         
	Outside Santhal Pargana, both the NDA and the Congress are running neck and neck. In the South Chotanagpur region, both parties are locked in straight fights in Ranchi as well as Hatia and Kanke, places close to the state capital.         
	In the Singhbhum region, state BJP chief Raghubar Das doesnt seem as confident as before in Jamshedpur (East), while sitting BJP MLA Sarayu Roy has trouble on his hands in the form of a Banna Gupta, a Samajwadi Party turncoat the Congress has fielded in Jamshedpur (West).         
	The real test of this election is to see if the Congress-Marandi alliance works. It will, Marandi told The Telegraph a week ago. The numbers may seem heavily weighed in favour of the Congress, and it may well be so. But keeping the ultimate objective (of forming a government) in mind, we agreed to such a deal, he said at his new party office, explaining the rationale behind the 19 seats the JVM agreed to contest.         
	Its do or die for Marandi and his JVM. The Congress can only hope for the best.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong must to beat Left, says Mamata
                                                                                                               Cong must to beat Left, says Mamata
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 9: Mamata Banerjee has stressed the need to stitch an alliance with the Congress to ensure the Lefts defeat in all 42 Lok Sabha seats in Bengal.        
	Over a week has passed since I discussed the seat-sharing deal with senior Congress leaders, but no response has come from them. I will have to wait for them to firm up the alliance because I strongly believe that an electoral tie-up with the Congress is necessary to ensure the Lefts defeat in all 42 seats, Mamata told a party workers meeting yesterday in her Calcutta South constituency. The Trinamul Congress chief regretted that Congress leaders were complaining that they were not offered winnable seats.         
	We had offered 14 seats out of 42 to Congress, including six already represented by the party. But they are complaining about the quality of seats. Tell me if they ask for all winnable seats, who will take those seats where chances of victory are less? she asked.         
	Instead of grumbling over seats, they (Congress leaders) should start building contacts with people at the grassroots to win their confidence. That is the only way of having a smooth sail in those seats.        
	Congress leaders, however, argued that all the eight seats offered  apart from the six it held  were traditional Left bastions. They were also not happy that four of the seats are reserved for the Scheduled Castes and Tribes.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 5: The Supreme Court today sent police a notice on the forced eviction of an 84-year-old academic, Lotika Sarkar, from her south Delhi house, allegedly taken over fraudulently by her tenant, Bihar IPS officer N.C. Dhoundial.        
	The case has drawn wide attention as a pointer to how vulnerable Delhis ordinary senior citizens may be if a well-known academic like Sarkar, former head of Delhi Universitys law faculty, can be treated in the way alleged.        
	An apex court bench issued a notice to the station house officer investigating the case, saying: Let him personally come and explain the status of the probe.        
	Dhoundial claims Sarkar had gifted the entire property, worth several crores, to his wife Preeti through a gift deed. Sarkar, who left the house in January this year, has denied gifting it to the Dhoundials. Her well-wishers allege the tenants had obtained her signature on the deed by fraud, taking advantage of her age and poor health.        
	Dhoundial, an inspector-general with Bihar police, isnt the only claimant to the property. Sarkars maid too has entrenched herself in the house and claims the childless and widowed academic used to treat her as a daughter and had intended to give it to her.        
	He (Dhoundial) is claiming she used to treat him like a son and she (the maid) is claiming that she was like a daughter while Sarkar herself has been forced to stay with her old students, Sarkars lawyer K.K. Venugopal told the court.        
	Dhoundial has filed an application in a lower Delhi court seeking Sarkars custody. He claims that a couple from Mumbai have taken Sarkar in and cut off all communication channels between the academic and the IPS officer.        
	One of Sarkars lawyers, Anupam Lal Das, however, told The Telegraph that the academic was very much in Delhi, was aware of everything going on and had attended a conference yesterday.        
	When Venugopal said the Dhoundials entire case was based on the allegedly fraudulent deed, the apex court suggested that Sarkars lawyers contest the deed in a lower court.        
	Venugopal alleged the probe was progressing slowly since Dhoundial was an influential officer and demanded a CBI probe. He said Dhoundial was facing a departmental inquiry in Bihar for going on unauthorised leave.        
	Hes taken leave for an indefinite period to take possession of the house, the lawyer said. The court, however, declined to order a CBI probe for now.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Montek peels layers off Pratibha plan
                                                                                                               Montek peels layers off Pratibha plan
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               Patil and Ahluwalia				                                 
	New Delhi, Sept. 23: A flagship government plan first proposed by the President to streamline the delivery of Indias myriad women-related schemes may prove self-defeating, Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia has warned.        
	The proposed structure of the National Mission for Empowerment of Women aimed at ensuring easier access to schemes and rights for women could strangle its very aim, government officials have quoted Ahluwalia as saying.        
	Multiple layers of bureaucracy envisaged under the mission to monitor the implementation of schemes could end up binding them in red tape, defeating its streamlining agenda, Ahluwalia has said.        
	The Planning Commission deputy chairman articulated his concerns to women and child development ministry officials at a recent presentation on the mission, the government sources said.         
	The commissions concerns are significant because its approval is generally a prerequisite for the finance ministrys nod to any new central government programme.        
	President Pratibha Patil had late last year proposed a new mechanism to streamline the delivery of existing womens programmes.        
	Patil set up a committee of governors to prepare a national blueprint for such a mechanism. The committee recommended a national mission. A group of ministers backed this recommendation.        
	In her address to the joint session of Parliament on June 4, the President announced the mission and said the government would initiate action within the first 100 days.        
	The Prime Minister will head the National Mission Authority (NMA) at the apex of the project, under the structure proposed by the WCD ministry. The NMA is followed by four layers of hierarchy at the Centre.        
	A central advisory group is to be headed by the WCD minister over an empowered committee of secretaries headed by the cabinet secretary, a mission directorate and a national resource centre for women.        
	An identical five-tier hierarchy follows at the state level, headed by a state mission authority under the chief minister.        
	Another mission authority  headed by the zilla parishad chairman  and a gender resource centre constitute the proposed hierarchy for each district. A panel involving the block development officer is proposed to monitor the national mission at the village level.        
	We wanted multiple layers to check against any corruption or delivery leaks, and also to ensure participation down to each village, a senior WCD ministry official said.        
	But Planning Commission sources said Ahluwalia was concerned that the multiple layers of hierarchy could emerge a parallel bureaucracy that may strangulate delivery of womens programmes.        
	Ahluwalia, the Planning Commission sources said, had suggested focusing on greater central implementation with less role for states in the mission structure.        
	India runs a slew of schemes targeting women  to counter trafficking, house destitute women, provide childcare centres and arrange hostels for working women.        
	The integrated child development scheme also provides nutrition for lactating women. Most government health programmes have components focusing on women and their concerns.

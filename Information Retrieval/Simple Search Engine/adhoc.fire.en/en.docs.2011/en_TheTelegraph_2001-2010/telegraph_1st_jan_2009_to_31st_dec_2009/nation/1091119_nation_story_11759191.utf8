                                                                                    Thursday , November 19 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Mulayam meets Ajit, sparks tieup buzz
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 18: Mulayam Singh Yadav today met NDA partner Ajit Singh, setting off a buzz about a possible realignment of political forces on the eve of Parliaments winter session.        
	Although both heartland leaders insisted they talked about raising sugarcane farmers woes in the House, observers said the huddle could lead to a sweeter outcome for both.        
	The one-hour meeting was being seen as an attempt by Mulayam  who drove down to Ajits residence  to give concrete shape to an informal understanding reached during the recent Firozabad byelections.         
	Ajit was said to have rallied his forces behind Mulayams daughter-in-law Dimple. Although she lost to the Congresss Raj Babbar  who had crossed over from Mulayams Samajwadi Party  a new friendship was forged between Mulayam and Ajit.        
	Ajit is seen to gain little by staying with the BJP, which leads the NDA. With Mulayam, he could create a block that could help him wield greater influence. For Mulayam, Ajits Jat votes, in combination with his own Yadav support, could help improve his fortunes.        
	Their sons benefit, too. Mulayam is trying to establish son Akhilesh as his successor, while Ajit sees son Jayant as his political heir. Together, both young leaders could stop a resurgent Congress under Rahul Gandhi in Uttar Pradesh, sources said.

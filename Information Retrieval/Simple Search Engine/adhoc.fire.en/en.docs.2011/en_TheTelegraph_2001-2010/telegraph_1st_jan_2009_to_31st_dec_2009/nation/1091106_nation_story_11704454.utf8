          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Nov 5: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik today reiterated his governments stand to combat the Maoist menace, even as rebels observed a 48-hour bandh in the southern fringes of the state, protesting against government-sponsored offensives against them.         
	For some time now we have been combating the (Maoist) menace, which is thoroughly illegal, and will continue doing so, Naveen told reporters here after returning from New Delhi this afternoon. Naveen was the sole chief minister (of seven invited) who attended a meeting held to discuss tribal welfare and related issues such as Naxalite menace at New Delhi.         
	Talking to the reporters, the chief minister checked off steps, including recruitment and training of personnel, that his government has undertaken for the citizens welfare. He said that he requested the Centre for long-term deployment of seven more battalions of central paramilitary force to counter Left-wing terrorism. But, he rued that the plea fell on deaf ears.        
	We are raising our forces to counter the rebels, he said. A fortnight ago, Naveen had ruled out dialogues with the rebels until they shunned the path of violence. Maoists in India are following the path of violence. How can the talks be possible in such an atmosphere? he asked.         
	When his attention was drawn to the tribal uprisings at Narayanpatna, Naveen said: The movement was basically over land rights. Our priority is to distribute patta to tribals on a mission mode. Pattas have been distributed to 55,000 tribals during the last three months and more than 2.5 lakh applications were under scrutiny.

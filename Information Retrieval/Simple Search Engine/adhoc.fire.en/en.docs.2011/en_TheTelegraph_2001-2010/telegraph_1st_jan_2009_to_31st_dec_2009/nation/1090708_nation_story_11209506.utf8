The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Water, water but 30% less to drink 
                                                                                                               Water, water but 30% less to drink 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, July 7: The financial capitals residents have been slapped with a 30 per cent cut in drinking water supply from today following low rainfall that has affected lakes which slake the thirst of the metropolis.         
	The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai had imposed a 10 per cent water cut in June, and increased it to 20 per cent from June 20, but the deficient monsoon has forced the civic authority to resort to a 30 per cent cut  the highest in two decades.         
	The corporation, covering the city and its suburbs that got flooded last week after heavy rain, had imposed a 25 per cent cut in 1992 and again in 1996 when the monsoon played truant.         
	This year, the civic authority is grappling with another poor season of rainfall and has announced the cut as a desperate measure to ensure that the water stock in the six lakes feeding the city lasts longer.        
	Calcutta residents need have no such fears as the municipal corporation says there is no shortage of drinking water. Mathematically, we have more than sufficient supply of potable water. At times, there are temporary shortages in some pockets because of leakage in water pipes or fall in pressure. But overall Calcutta is a water-surplus city, said municipal commissioner Alapan Bandopadhyay.        
	 The impact of the Mumbai cut is yet to be felt since most residential buildings are equipped with tanks that can store up to two days of drinking water.         
	Residents of upscale south Mumbai, home to industrialists and many of Mumbais elite, which receives round-the-clock water supply, did not face any problems. But in middle-class pockets, which get water only for one to four hours a day, residents panicked and stocked up.        
	Rumi Joshi, 21, who stays in the plush Breach Candy area of south Mumbai, said: Our building has large water tanks, and we get drinking water round the clock. I did not face any problem.         
	Agreed model-turned-actress Pooja Bedi, who lives in a highrise in Versova. We did not face any problems because our housing society has adequate storage. If needed, the society gets water tankers to supply water, she said.         
	Jayashree Ranade, a resident of Girgaums middleclass chawls, is feeling the pinch. We get water for about an hour early morning. We have to wake up at dawn and stock up water. Today, we got water only for 45 minutes, she said.         
	The corporation has issued directives to BEST  the state utility service which runs buses  not to use potable water for washing its vehicles, and asked five-star hotels and clubs to desist from using drinking water to fill swimming pools. Supply will also be restricted to commercial establishments, government offices, and railway stations.        
	Mumbai receives about 3,300 million litres of water from six lakes  Modak Sagar, Tansa, Vihar, Tulsi, Upper Vaitarna and Bhatsa. Civic officials said water levels in the lakes were four to 10 metres lower than last year.

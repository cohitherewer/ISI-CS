          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, April 9: A 72-year-old candidate from Bhubaneswar (Central) was allegedly attack by unidentified miscreants while she was in a temple before beginning her campaign.        
	Susama Nanda is contesting as an Independent after she was denied a BJD ticket. Grey haired and wrinkled Susama is now down with a broken wrist. She has filed a complaint at the Kharavelanagar police station stating that two motorcycle-borne youths intercepted her on her way to a nearby temple. I go to the temple everyday. I also begin my campaigns after seeking the lords blessings. The men who attacked me must have known my routine, she said today. They injured my hand and when I cried for help, the men whizzed away, before I could identify them, she added.        
	Identification was even more difficult as the men were wearing helmets and the senior citizen could not note down the vehicle number due to the distance.         
	The men apparently threatened Susama to withdraw her candidature or face consequences.         
	The incident occurred close to the Unit-4 market and residents rushed to the spot after hearing her shouts and helped to carry her to the Capital Hospital. X-ray reports showed a fracture in her left hand and a ligament injury on her wrists.         
	The incident, however, has not deterred Susama from fighting against political bigwigs such as former industries minister Biswa Bhushan Harichandan of the BJP, Bijoy Mohanty of the BJD and Alok Jena of the Congress  also contending from the same area. Many, however, see the incident as a way to garner sympathy votes.         
	Inspector-in-charge of Kharavela Nagar police station Pramod Rath said: We are investigating the case and looking into her request for extra security cover.

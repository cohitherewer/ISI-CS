The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | House talk on meal scheme
                                                                                                               House talk on meal scheme
                            
	Patna, June 30 (PTI): The allegation of misuse of funds meant for the midday meal scheme will be probed by a House committee, the Bihar Speaker said today.        
	Houses question and call attention committee will inquire into the allegation within a specified time-frame, said Speaker Udai Narain Choudhary after Opposition members raised a hue and cry over the issue.        
	Earlier in the day, state HRD minister Hari Narain Singh said the government had sought detailed reports from district authorities regarding the midday meal scheme for schoolchildren.        
	Replying to a short notice question by CPM MLA Ramdeo Verma, Singh said stern action would be taken against those found guilty.        
	Alleging large-scale irregularities and misuse of funds in schools, Opposition members said the turn out of students were being inflated in order to defalcate the money earmarked for the project.         
	Chief minister Nitish Kumar later proposed to hold an all-party meeting to discuss the issue. Nitish added that he had assigned the job of providing midday meals to external agencies, as it would help teachers to concentrate on their teaching jobs.        
	On complaints that private coaching institutions are charging exorbitant fees from students, the HRD Minister said: We will not allow this practice to go on and we are considering proposals to introducing uniform fee structure for coaching centres operating in the state.        
	He also threatened that stern action would be taken against the teachers of the state-run colleges, if they were found working in coaching institutes during their assigned duties on working days.        
	Nitish also sounded a word of caution against imposing a ceiling on the number of BPL families, while addressing the Centre plan to impose a legislation to guarantee food security to the poor. Any flaw in the proposed act leading to unintended exclusions of genuinely poor will result in discontent at ground-level, he said in a letter to Union food minister Sharad Pawar.         
	Instead, he suggested that a system of direct cash transfer to beneficiaries should be adopted instead of resorting to the complex delivery mechanism which, he said, was fraught with possibilities of default and errors.

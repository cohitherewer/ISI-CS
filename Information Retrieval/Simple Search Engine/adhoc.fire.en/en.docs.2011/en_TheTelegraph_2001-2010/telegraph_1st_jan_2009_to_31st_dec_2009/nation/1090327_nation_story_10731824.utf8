          OUR BUREAU AND PTI                              
	New Delhi, March 26: Union minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, who had suffered a cardiac arrest six months ago, is showing unique signs of recovery not usually seen among patients in his condition, Apollo Hospital sources said.         
	Das Munshi, 62, who was brought to Apollo in October last year in a critical condition that had necessitated ventilator-assisted life support until this January, has shown further improvement, the sources said.         
	Hes opening his eyes and moving pupils on his own  something he wasnt able to do when he was brought here, a source said. But there appears to be no recognition.         
	Das Munshi had been moved to Apollo from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences where he was revived after a massive heart attack. His cardiac arrest, doctors suspect, had affected blood flow to the brain.         
	The survival rate of such patients is really very less, PTI quoted Vinit Suri, consultant neurologist, as saying today. Das Munshi has shown an impressive will power to defy the near-death condition, Suri told PTI.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | President seal on new varsities 
                                                                                                               President seal on new varsities 
  - Pitroda panel objects, but   ordinance gets poll push        CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                           
	New Delhi, Jan. 16: President Pratibha Patil has promulgated an ordinance allowing the government to establish 15 new central universities despite last-minute objections by the National Knowledge Commission that the ordinance would hurt higher education.         
	The President signed the ordinance late last night even as the commission headed by Sam Pitroda tried to convince the Prime Minister and senior government officials against the move.         
	Patils signature triggered a chain of events today that saw the human resource development ministry launch a process of selection of vice-chancellors within hours.         
	It has also set off fireworks between the commission and the ministry, which the commission believes is keen to retain control over universities while officially calling them autonomous.         
	The HRD ministry, as first reported by The Telegraph on January 2, 2009, is rushing to finalise the launch of the universities before the Election Commission announces the Lok Sabha polls.         
	The government is keen to start classes at the universities in the 2009 academic session, said the ministry note to the President.         
	The ministry, a top HRD official said, will bring the ordinance before both Houses when Parliament meets briefly in February. We want the ordinance to be cleared by both Houses in the narrow slot for which the Parliament is meeting so that we can start classes from 2009, the official said.         
	An ordinance needs parliamentary ratification within six months.         
	The HRD ministry had introduced an umbrella legislation, the Central Universities Bill, 2008, in December to launch 16 new universities, one in each state without a central university. Of the 16, four would be upgraded state universities in Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Goa and Uttarakhand. But within days of the bill being listed in Parliament, Goa asked the Centre to withdraw Goa University from the list of varsities to be upgraded.         
	The bill was not tabled as it needed to be amended. The ordinance signed by the President mentions only 15 new central universities  12 to be started, three to be upgraded.         
	But the knowledge panel has alleged that the draft legislation repeats earlier mistakes and compounds persistent problems of higher education in India. In letters to the Prime Minister and key policy makers, it said the draft legislation ignored key recommendations by it for reforms in higher education.         
	Therefore, this draft legislation needs to be reconsidered and reformulated in consultation with all stakeholders, the commission said.         
	But the language in the ministrys note may have tilted the scales in favour of signing the ordinance, sources said. The note made it explicitly clear the ordinance needed to be promulgated immediately since starting the universities may take a month  the time the government needs before announcement of polls.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rural job with food offer in drought zones
                                                                                                               Rural job with food offer in drought zones
          CITHARA PAUL                           A farmer scans the sky in a drought-hit village in Uttar Pradesh                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 18: The duration of the rural job scheme and the nature of remuneration are expected to be changed to help fight the drought.         
	The National Rural Employment Guarantee (NREGA) programme could have a food grain component in drought-affected districts, where the number of guaranteed workdays under the scheme could also be increased from 100 at present to 150.        
	The plan, a brainchild of rural development minister C.P. Joshi whose home state Rajasthan is one of the worst hit, aims to turn NREGA into a food-for-work programme in the districts declared drought-affected by states. So far, 177 of the countrys 626 districts have been given the tag.        
	Several states, including the Congress-ruled Rajasthan, have demanded the Centre raise the number of workdays to 200 in the dry zones.        
	We are thinking of including a food component in the scheme as it is imperative to insulate the rural poor from drought and its after-effects. When people are struggling to have even a single meal a day, providing food for work is the best and quickest solution, an official in Joshis ministry said. Wages under the scheme have so far been paid only in cash.        
	The grains to be provided in return for work will come from the buffer stock lying in warehouses. Stocks are more than enough in Food Corporation of India godowns, the official said.         
	He, however, said the exact ways to transform the NREGA into a specific food-for-work scheme were still being worked out. All details, including the ratio of food component, keeping market food prices in mind, have to be worked out, said the official.         
	Similarly, the procedures of collection and distribution of food grains have to be finalised, he added. Sources said the Congress leadership is backing Joshi on the changes.        
	Our information is that the Congress leadership, including Rahul Gandhi, totally agrees with the ministers suggestion as the party thinks it will be crucial in boosting the rural economy, said the official.         
	A final decision is expected by Rajiv Gandhis birth anniversary on August 20, when a national convention on the scheme has been organised by the rural development ministry in the capital.        
	Demand for work under the plan has increased in recent weeks because of the drought, the official said. More people, including small farmers unable to carry out cultivation, are looking to NREGA for livelihood, said the official.         
	Another proposal doing the rounds in the ministry seeks to lay emphasis on water conservation works under NREGA by providing additional incentives.         
	We want to make NREGA not just about drought relief but also about floods by stressing more on water conservation, the official said         
	The idea is to tailor the scheme in such a way that it offers succour during natural calamities.         
	The government is also considering a special drought package for rural landowners. This may include subsidised electricity or diesel to help run pump sets.

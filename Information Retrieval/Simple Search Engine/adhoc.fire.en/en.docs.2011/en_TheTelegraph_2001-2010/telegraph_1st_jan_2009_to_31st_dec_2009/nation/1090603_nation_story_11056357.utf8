The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Civic elections in hills find no contestants
                                                                                                               Civic elections in hills find no contestants
          OUR BUREAU                              
	June 2: The hills are headed for civic elections this month-end but none has signed up to contest them.        
	Not a single candidate from any party has filed nomination for the June 28 municipal elections in Darjeeling, Kurseong and Kalimpong, though today was the last day for doing so.        
	No one has filed nomination in any of the three municipalities, Darjeeling district magistrate Surendra Gupta said.        
	The boycott possibly stems from the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha demand that the dysfunctional two-tier panchayat system in the hills be turned into a three-tier one as exists in the rest of Bengal.        
	Morcha president Bimal Gurung had earlier issued a threat that unless this was done, his party would not allow municipality elections to be held in the hills.        
	In Calcutta, municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya said it was not clear to the Bengal government what exactly the Morcha wanted. Morcha representatives are to meet chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee tomorrow. We are yet to know what the Morchas demand is, he said.         
	Between 1984 and 1994, the municipal polls had not been possible because of the Gorkhaland agitation.        
	There cannot be elections to the Darjeeling, Kurseong and Kalimpong municipalities as nomination papers have not been submitted. So, there is no question of holding elections, Bengal home secretary Ardhendu Sen said today.        
	A state poll panel official added: We have communicated to the state government that elections cannot be held.        
	Observers said it would not be easy to meet the Morcha demand as conversion to a three-tier panchayat system not only called for a constitutional amendment but also dissolution of the Siliguri Mahakuma Parishad.        
	In the Siliguri sub-division of Darjeeling district, a three-tier system is in place but the zilla parishad has been replaced by the Mahakuma Parishad. The Constitution has clearly said there can be only one zilla parishad for each district, a lawyer said.        
	The observers said the only option left for the state government was to appoint an administrator to run the municipalities. The present boards, elected in 2004, will be in office till July 13.        
	At the moment, there is no functional panchayat in the hills. A system comprising gram panchayats and panchayat samitis was in place in Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council areas, but no election has been held since 2000.        
	Till then, polls were held only to the gram panchayats as the Gorkha National Liberation Front that ran the DGHC felt the powers of the panchayat samitis would overlap with the councils.

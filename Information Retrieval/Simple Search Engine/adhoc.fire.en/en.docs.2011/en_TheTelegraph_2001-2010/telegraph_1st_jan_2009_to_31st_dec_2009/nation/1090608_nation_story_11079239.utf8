	Dhaka, June 7 (PTI): A key aide of Dawood Ibrahim was arrested in the Bangladesh capital today while a hunt was on to nab other members of the D-gang based on disclosures by two detained operatives, police said.        
	We arrested Arif alias Chachcha from the Mohammadpur area of the city, a police spokesperson said.         
	Arif is alleged to be one of the top operatives of the 100-strong D-gang in Bangladesh. He has been living in Dhaka identifying himself as a member of the Urdu-speaking stranded Pakistani community, or Bihari, since 2001 when he fled India, the police said.        
	Police sources said Arif had revealed during interrogation that he was in touch with Dawoods second-in-command Chhota Shakeel.

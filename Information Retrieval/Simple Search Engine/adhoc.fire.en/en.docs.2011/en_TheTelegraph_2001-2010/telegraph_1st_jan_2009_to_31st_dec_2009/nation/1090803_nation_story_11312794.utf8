  - Less takers for colleges in south, west          OUR CORRESPONDENT       
	Cuttack, Aug. 2: The department of higher education is struggling to accommodate a steady flow of applicants all waiting to join the Plus-Two streams in government colleges in coastal Orissa, while institutes in western and southern Orissa are struggling to fill up seats.         
	The government introduced a common e-admission policy for 60 colleges in 2009. Under the system, Class-X students could apply to any stream at 60 colleges through a common form.         
	Colleges under the purview of the system include College of Basic Science and Humanities under Orissa University of Agriculture and Technology (Ouat) and nine government-aided colleges at Rayagada, Nawarangpur, Sonepur, Baudh, Deogarh, Jharsuguda, Nayagarh, Jagatsinghpur and Kendrapada.         
	We didnt have to draw up a cut-off list for 12 colleges, as applications received were less than expected, said a senior official. In fact, no one applied for the 128 seats at Government Junior Science College at Jiranga of Gajapati, he said.         
	Sources said 1,017 applications were received for 2,028 seats offered by 11 colleges, while 13 applications were received for 128 seats at Government Junior Science College at Kutra in Sundergarh district.         
	Ravenshaw (Cuttack) and BJB Junior College (Bhubaneswar) on the other hand had emerged as the top favourite. While 2,686 applications were received for the 1,152 seats in Ravenshaw, 2,883 applications were received for the 1,184 seats in BJB. Fakir Mohan (Balasore), Government Junior College (Bhadrak), SCS (Puri) and Khalikote (Berhampur) had received more than 2,000 applications.         
	Sources said for 30,644 seats offered by the 60 colleges, 49,172 applications were received, as against the 87,000 applications received in 2008. Since 49,172 applications exercised as many as 1.12 lakh options this year, number of applications in real term was higher in 2009, an official explained.         
	Order of preferences could be made on the basis of options. Students were allowed to exercise as many as 13 options.         
	Admission is being granted on the basis of the ranking vis--vis cut-off marks in respective colleges.

	Bhubaneswar, March 12: The festival of colours passed off peacefully in the capital as commoners and politicians alike came out on the streets in large numbers to celebrate.         
	The splashing of colours, accompanied by drumbeats and songs, continued till late in the afternoon among revellers in spite of the scorching sun overhead. Water-filled balloons were hurled down from rooftops and balconies of colonies accompanied by shouts of Bura na mano, Holi Hai!        
	Thousands of tribal children gathered at the Kalinga School of Social Sciences to play and celebrity guests, including Oriya album actors Sabyasachi, Bobby Mishra, Barsha and Jina, dropped in to celebrate with them. We also had the matka phodo ritual. It was fun, said a girl.        
	Orphan children at the SoS Children Village also had a fun time. Despite our ongoing exams, Holi was a stress buster. We enjoyed a lot, said Renu, an inmate. The inmates of Jharpada special jail, too, had a great time. Thandai, bhang, and matka phodo were a part of the arrangements on several engineering and management campuses. In several parts of the state  including Kendrapada  Muslims joined the fun. The commisionerate of police in the city remained alert but no cases were booked.

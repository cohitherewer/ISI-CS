                                                                                                               Stricter rules in twin cities
  - Helmet debate hots up          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                     
	Bhubaneswar, April 28: Heres a directive that might heat things up further in summer.         
	Police commissionerate for Bhubaneswar and Cuttack has come out with a notification making it compulsory for two-wheeler riders to wear helmets. The final word of caution also contains a direction for pillion riders to wear an ISI-certified helmet. We will be strictly enforcing traffic and vehicle rules from May 1. The violators will have to cough up a fine of Rs 500 to Rs 1,000, said assistant commissioner of police (traffic) Nirmal Satpathy.         
	Despite the fact that it protects head from injuries, many are not happy. Wearing helmets is a mindless proposition, especially in summer its more like a head trap. Its irritating, said Priyabrata Rath, an engineering student. At least there should be some relaxation during summers, he added.        
	Rukmani Jena, things that homemaker, is plain angry. I do not understand the need for pillion riders to wear helmets. It leads to hair loss.         
	For some like Priyanka Baisakh, the helmet conduces her to drive faster. It irritates me and I feel like driving faster to reach my destination and get rid of my helmet, said Priyanka Baisakh, a student of BJB College.        
	Minorities such as Sikhs, too, are worried. We are not supposed to wear anything other than a turban on our heads, said Gurpreet Singh, a Sikh businessman.         
	Undoubtedly, the sale of helmets have gone up in the city in the past few months, but several people have been complaining of neck and back pain due to prolonged use. The answer may be to switch to white or silver helmets that reflect the suns rays more than the dark-coloured ones, said Soubhagya Mishra, a helmet dealer.         
	Besides making helmets compulsory, the new set of rules also makes driving licence compulsory, while driving. Commuters will also be penalised for jaywalking.         
	Several campaigns have been carried out in the past to sensitise the public about regulations. Offenders this time will be duly fined, warned assistant commissioner of police Satpathy.        
	Use of mobile phones and music players while driving is banned, while seat belts are compulsory for drivers of four-wheeler. The commissionerate has also directed public vehicles to not carry passengers beyond the prescribed number and avoid illegal parking.         
	The commissionerate police system has already collected Rs 1,20,59,240 as fine from 1,09,170 violators in the twin cities within a year.

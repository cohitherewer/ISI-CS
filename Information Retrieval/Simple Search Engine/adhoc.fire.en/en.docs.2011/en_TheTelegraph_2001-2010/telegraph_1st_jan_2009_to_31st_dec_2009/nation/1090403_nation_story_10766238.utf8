The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tytler riot clean chit heat on Sonia
                                                                                                               Tytler riot clean chit heat on Sonia
          PTI AND OUR CORRESPONDENT                      Tytler: Off the hook                          
	New Delhi/Chandigarh, April 2: The CBI today gave Congress leader Jagdish Tytler a clean chit in a 1984 anti-Sikh riot case, triggering protests from victims, Sikh religious bodies and Opposition politicians.        
	The agency said it lacked sufficient evidence against Tytler, 65, who had been forced to resign as minister from the UPA government after a riot probe panel indicted him.        
	The CBI sought the closure of the 25-year-old case in a report filed before the additional chief metropolitan magistrates court, which had rejected an earlier clean chit in December 2007 and asked for a fresh probe.        
	During further investigation sufficient evidence regarding the involvement of Jagdish Tytler did not come up on record, a CBI spokesperson said in a statement. He said the statements of two of the witnesses were inconsistent, unreliable and unworthy of credit.        
	The court will consider the report on April 9.        
	The Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC) accused Sonia Gandhi of orchestrating the CBI move while Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal urged the countrys Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, to act.        
	His silence at this hour could prove to be a historic failure to discharge his basic constitutional responsibility, Badal, chief of the Shiromani Akali Dal, said.        
	Three persons were directly involved in the massacre in 1984 and Sonia knows the role they played, SGPC president Avtar Singh Makkar said. H.K.L. Bhagat is dead. Sajjan Kumar and Tytler, whose roles have been established beyond doubt by witnesses, are felicitated and even rewarded with tickets.        
	The reference was to Tytler receiving Congress nomination from a Delhi seat.         
	The moment the Congress gave Tytler a ticket it was clear the government would force the CBI to give him a clean chit, riot victims lawyer H.S. Phoolka said. The CBI seems hand in glove with the accused.        
	A group of riot victims demonstrated outside the Karkardooma court complex.        
	The truth has come out once again. I was given a clean chit earlier also but a political conspiracy was hatched against me, Tytler said.        
	In December 2007, the court had demanded a fresh probe since Jasbir Singh, a witness declared untraceable, had surfaced.        
	The California-based witness had claimed to have overheard Tytler making a comment relating to the killing of Sikhs in his then constituency, Delhi Sadar, on the night of November 3, 1984.        
	BJP spokesman Balbir Punj said the clean chit had shaken the faith of the common man and exposed the hypocrisy of the Congress.        
	The CBI opposed Phoolkas demand for a copy of the final investigation report, filed in the court on March 28, saying he was not entitled to it. Phoolka said he was representing the riot victims, who had a right to know the reports contents.

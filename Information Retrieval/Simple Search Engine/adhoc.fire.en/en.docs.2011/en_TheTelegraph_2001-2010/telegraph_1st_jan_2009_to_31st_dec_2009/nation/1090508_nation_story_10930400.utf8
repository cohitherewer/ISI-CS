                                                                                                               Nun seeks venue change
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, May 7: The nun who was allegedly a victim of a gangrape during the 2008 Kandhamal riots, has filed a fresh petition in Orissa High Court urging shift of venue for the test identification (TI) parade from Baliguda.         
	The 29-year-old Catholic nun who did not attend the TI parade at Baliguda sub-jail today, has stated that she did not feel safe to travel to the district.         
	She had moved the high court after the court of Baliguda sub-divisional judicial magistrate rejected her earlier petition on May 1.         
	Baliguda has not been safe for me after August 25, 2008, she has said in her plea.        
	Earlier, the high court had allowed the TI parade venue to be shifted to Choudwar central jail (Cuttack) instead of Baliguda and there the nun had identified two of the 10 accused on January 5, 2009. The TI parade was held in the Choudwar jail.        
	According to reports, the nun was raped at K-Nuagaon under Baliguda police station on August 25, 2008.         
	Ten people were later arrested and two were identified by the victim at a TI parade.         
	A second TI parade had become imperative as five more accused had since then been arrested.         
	Last month, the nun had moved the high court asking it to shift the trial from Baliguda to Cuttack.         
	In an interim order, the high court had imposed restrictions on proceedings involving deposition by the victim nun in the trial court.        
	Meanwhile, the trial had started before the fast-track judicial magistrate court at Baliguda on April 20.         
	Six persons, including the block development officer of K-Nuagaon, had deposed in the sub-divisional court in connection with the case in three days of proceedings before this.

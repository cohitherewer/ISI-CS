          JAYANTH JACOB                      Abdulla Kutty                          
	New Delhi, Nov. 10: Keralas man of surprises sprang another today.         
	A.P. Abdulla Kutty, fighting against the might of his former party in Kannur, had declared that the CPM can kill him, but it cant defeat him.         
	The life threat may have been a trifle exaggeration, as the badlands of Kannur are as familiar to him as its blood-smeared politics, but Kutty today showed that his bravado wasnt all bluster.         
	Kutty, a two-time CPM MP who was expelled from the party, won in style defying the government machinery which worked overtime to defeat him. Pitted against CPM stalwart M.V. Jayarajan, the 42-year-old Kutty stole the march with a margin of close to 13,000.         
	When in the CPM, Kutty sprang surprises, not all of them pleasant, on old-school communists. His nights were at times longer in Delhi, and he revelled in them.         
	When comrades questioned his meeting with an astrologer, he said it was curiosity that had prompted him to do what communists wouldnt do in public.         
	He even surprised Mullapalli Ramachandran, a veteran Congress leader with a clean image, in his maiden Lok Sabha elections in 1999. Then 32, Kutty floored Ramachandran, a five-time MP. The result was the same in 2004, with the margin of victory zooming from 10,285 to 83,000.         
	The surprises continued: he made personal visits to religious places and publicly spoke out against bandhs, earning CPM censure.         
	Then came the biggest surprise.         
	Kutty said Narendra Modi, a pariah for the Left, stood for development. All hell broke loose and the axe of the CPM fell on him early this year. Some in the CPM believe the party didnt make use of a potential Muslim leader, who could have been handled with care.

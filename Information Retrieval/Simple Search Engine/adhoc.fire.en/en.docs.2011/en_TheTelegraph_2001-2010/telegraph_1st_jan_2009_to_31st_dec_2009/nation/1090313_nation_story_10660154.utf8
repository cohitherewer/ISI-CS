	Cuttack, March 12: The high court has directed the state to pay a compensation of Rs 3 lakh to the wife of an accused who died in police custody at Mahanga police station six years ago, a day after he was arrested for theft of a TV set.        
	The death had triggered public uproar as the police did not hand over the body to the family members after postmortem at the SCB Medical College Hospital in Cuttack, but cremated it at Khannagar without their consent.        
	Villagers of Bhakuda, Daulatpur and Mukundapur had protested by blocking National Highway 5 near Bhakuda under Balichandrapur police station. Orissa Pradesh Congress Committee had demanded a judicial inquiry to find out the truth. The high court had ordered the inquiry after the victims wife filed a writ petition seeking compensation for the death.         
	Pitambar Pradhan, a resident of Bhakuda village was arrested on the charges of stealing a colour TV set from the house of one Jayanta Bal of Alinagar under Mahanga police station in Cuttack district on January 30, 2003. He was found hanging from the fan at the police station next morning. The police claimed he had committed suicide.        
	Justice C.R. Pal in his probe report concluded that had there been proper watch, it would not have been possible for the man to commit suicide. ASI Pitambar Nayak and constable Bipin Bihari Nanda were suspended on charges of negligence and dereliction of duty.         
	Allowing the writ petition by Ahalya, wife of the deceased the two judge bench of Justice B.P. Das and Justice R.N. Biswal said the utter carelessness and indifferent attitude of the policemen in preventing the person in custody to commit suicide had been clearly established by the inquiring judge in the report.        
	The state is liable to pay the compensation for criminal negligence, the court said in its order on Tuesday. The compensation should be paid within a period of three months, the order said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Maoists pick out poll targets
                                                                                                               Maoists pick out poll targets
          OUR BUREAU                              
	April 15: Maoists stormed a BSF shelter in Bihar, triggered landmine blasts in Jharkhand and called an Orissa bandh in a multi-pronged offensive targeting the first phase of polls tomorrow.        
	The attacks left 18 persons, including two security personnel, dead.        
	In Bihar, at least 10 rebels were killed in an encounter that began when they fired rocket-launchers  for the first time, according to police  on a school housing BSF men on poll duty in Rohtas.        
	Landmines were used to blow up a bus carrying ration for central paramilitary forces in Jharkhands Latehar district, leading to an encounter that killed two CRPF men and at least six others.        
	In Bihar, the rocket attack in Rohtas triggered an encounter that lasted four hours from 1am today.         
	Unable to match the BSFs firepower and demoralised at the 10 casualties, the rebels retreated into the hills, Rohtas police chief Vikas Vaibhav said. One jawan was injured and has been shifted to Patna.        
	The district headquarters of Rohtas is Sasaram, from where Union minister Meera Kumar is contesting the polls on a Congress ticket. The district borders Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand, from where the police suspect some of the 300 guerrillas might have come.        
	Inspector-general (Patna zone) Sunil Kumar said the BSF jawans had demolished two rebel camps in the area in a pre-poll, flush-out operation days back. This mornings attack might have been in retaliation to that raid.         
	An Air Force plane will fly over the area keeping a watch during tomorrows voting, Kumar said.        
	In Jharkhands Latehar, 200km from capital Ranchi, the 6.15am blast ripped apart the bus with the CRPF ration, killing its civilian driver and the lone jawan on board.        
	Suspecting the area could be booby-trapped, the other jawans, around 100 of them, chose to walk the 20km route from their camp at a nearby school to booths in the Chatra Lok Sabha constituency, of which Latehar is a part.        
	After the blast, the jawans engaged the rebels, who were on higher ground, in an encounter. We were fortunate to find some walls which we used to guard ourselves. Otherwise we would have suffered more casualties, said a jawan.        
	Eight CRPF men were injured and airlifted to a Ranchi hospital, but one died on the way. The jawans claimed to have killed at least five guerrillas, but DIG (Palamau) Nandu Prasad wouldnt confirm this.        
	Villagers alleged the five werent Maoists but local residents hiding in trenches while the encounter was on. CRPF personnel dragged them out of the trenches and killed them in a fit of rage, one villager said.         
	In Orissa, Maoists blocked roads in Koraput, Kandhamal and Malkangiri, bordering Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, with tree trunks. Some other roads were dug up. They have called a bandh tomorrow.        
	Malkangiri collector Nitin Bhanudas Jawale said the blockades had made it difficult for poll officials to reach their destinations. The authorities plan to fly poll officials in a chopper to rebel-infested areas tomorrow, if needed.

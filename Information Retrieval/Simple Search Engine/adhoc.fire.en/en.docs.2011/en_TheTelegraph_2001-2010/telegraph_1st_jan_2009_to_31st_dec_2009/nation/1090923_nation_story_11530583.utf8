The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sachin-coated pill, er, pickle...
                                                                                                               Sachin-coated pill, er, pickle...
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                    
	New Delhi, Sept. 22: Even being compared to Sachin Tendulkar can leave you feeling in a bit of a pickle, L.K. Advani has found out.        
	Manohar Parrikar, one of the BJPs rising stars, yesterday drew parallels between the innings of Advani and Indias best batsman.        
	That was no doubt a great advance on a comparison to Humpty Dumpty  as rebel MP Arun Shourie had recently dubbed the party brass  but Parrikars next comment would have left Advani with a sour taste in the mouth.        
	A failure to retire in time may turn even a great career into spoilt pickle, the former Goa chief minister told a Konkani channel last night.        
	The BJP, now used to its leaders brawling in public, put up a stoical face but off the cameras, officials admitted themselves flummoxed.        
	Parrikar, a possible candidate for BJP president in RSS eyes, today translated the interview for The Telegraph. It all apparently began when he named Advani as his favourite leader in an answer to a question.        
	I praised Advani for his integrity and character and said he is currently playing an excellent innings. I spoke of my second love after politics, which is cricket, and named Tendulkar as my favourite player, he said over the phone.        
	Tendulkar is maturing day by day but even the best player has his limitation and has to stop playing some day. Its like pickle. It tastes best for a year after maturing but spoils after two years.        
	Parrikar stressed that the reference to spoilt pickle came in relation to his comments on Tendulkar and not Advani. There were enough hints in the interview, however, that party elders should now fade away.        
	I was asked if a young person is suited to take over as (party) president. I replied, Yes, ideally between 45 and 55, the 53-year-old said. He added that Advani should think of mentoring the BJP.        
	Parrikar is the first BJP leader to publicly echo RSS chief Mohanrao Bhagwats suggestion for a generation change at the top in the BJP.         
	Sources denied that Parrikar was positioning himself in the race, arguing the reference to youth was just a way of nudging Advani to consider Bhagwats proposal seriously.        
	The RSS has said what it had to, and it is for Advani to take it from there. If hes not prepared to do it, the Sangh will start pressure him through more such interviews, a source said.        
	Advani himself had virtually compared himself to Tendulkar last August, saying: When we lost (the polls), people were disappointed the way they get disappointed whenever Tendulkar gets out in the 90s.        
	It prompted a critic to say that unlike Tendulkar, who withdrew when he realised he was a better batsman than captain, Advani was unwilling to let the party move on under a new captain.

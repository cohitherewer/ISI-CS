The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | US accuses Pak of modifying missile with India on radar 
                                                                                                               US accuses Pak of modifying missile with India on radar 
          ERIC SCHMITT AND DAVID E. SANGER                              
	Washington, Aug. 30: The US has accused Pakistan of illegally modifying American-made missiles to expand its capability to strike land targets, a potential threat to India, according to officials.         
	The charge, which set off a new outbreak of tensions between the US and Pakistan, was made in an unpublicised diplomatic protest in late June to Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani and other top Pakistani officials.         
	The accusation comes at a particularly delicate time, when the administration is asking Congress to approve $7.5 billion in aid to Pakistan over the next five years, and when Washington is pressing a reluctant Pakistani military to focus its attention on fighting the Taliban rather than expanding its nuclear and conventional forces aimed at India.        
	While American officials say the weapon in the latest dispute is a conventional one  based on the Harpoon anti-ship missiles that were sold to Pakistan by the Ronald Reagan administration as a defensive weapon in the Cold War  the subtext of the argument is the growing concern about the speed with which Pakistan is developing new generations of both conventional and nuclear weapons.         
	Theres a concerted effort to get these guys to slow down, one senior US administration official said. Their energies are misdirected.        
	At issue is the detection by American intelligence agencies of a suspicious missile test on April 23  a test never announced by Pakistan  that appeared to give the country a new offensive weapon.         
	American military and intelligence officials say they suspect Pakistan has modified the Harpoon anti-ship missiles that the US sold to the country in the 1980s, a move that would be a violation of the Arms Control Export Act.         
	Pakistan has denied the charge, saying it developed the missile itself.         
	The US has also accused Pakistan of modifying American-made P-3C aircraft for land-attack missions, another violation of US law that the Barack Obama administration has protested.        
	Whatever their origin, the missiles would be a significant new entry into Pakistans arsenal against India. They would enable Pakistans small navy to strike targets on land, complementing the sizeable land-based missile arsenal that Pakistan has developed.         
	That, in turn, would be likely to spur another round of an arms race with India that the US has been trying, unsuccessfully, to halt.         
	The focus of our concern is that this is a potential unauthorised modification of a maritime anti-ship defensive capability to an offensive land-attack missile, said another senior administration official.         
	The potential for proliferation and end-use violations are things we watch very closely, the official added. When we have concerns, we act aggressively.         
	A senior Pakistani official said the American accusation was incorrect. The official said the missile tested was developed by Pakistan, just as it had modified North Korean designs to build a range of land-based missiles that could strike India.         
	He said Pakistan had taken the unusual step of agreeing to allow American officials to inspect the countrys Harpoon inventory to prove it had not violated the law, a step US administration officials praised.        
	Some experts are also sceptical of the American claims.         
	Robert Hewson, editor of Janes Air-Launched Weapons, a yearbook and web-based data service, said the Harpoon missile did not have the necessary range for a land-attack missile, which would lend credibility to Pakistani claims that they are developing their own new missile. Moreover, he said, Pakistan already has more modern land-attack missiles that it developed itself or acquired from China.         
	Theyre beyond the need to reverse-engineer old US kit, Hewson said. Theyre more sophisticated than that.         
	Hewson said the ship-to-shore missile that Pakistan was testing was part of a concerted effort to develop an array of conventional missiles that could be fired from the air, land or sea to address Indias much more formidable conventional missile arsenal.         
	The dispute highlights the level of mistrust that remains between the US and the Pakistani military. A central element of the American effort has been to get the military refocused on the internal threat facing the country, rather than on the threat the country believes it still faces from India.         
	Pakistani officials have insisted they are making that shift. But the evidence continues to point to heavy investments in both nuclear and conventional weapons that experts say have no utility in the battle against insurgents.         
	Over the years, the US has provided a total of 165 Harpoon missiles to Pakistan, including 37 of the older-model weapons that were delivered from 1985 to 1988.        
	The countrys nuclear arsenal is expanding faster than any other nations.         
	In May, Pakistan conducted a test firing of its Babur medium-range cruise missile, a weapon that military experts say could potentially be tipped with a nuclear warhead. The test was conducted on May 6, during a visit to Washington by President Asif Ali Zardari, but was not made public by Pakistani officials until three days after the meetings had ended to avoid upsetting the talks.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rajnath defuses Shourie bomb
                                                                                                               Rajnath defuses Shourie bomb
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 19: BJP president Rajnath Singh narrowly averted another letter-bomb from exploding in the leaderships face on the eve of a critical two-day session of the national executive, but senior partyman Arun Shouries salvo is smouldering away on a short fuse sure to run out tomorrow.        
	Following Yashwant Sinhas angered resignation from all party posts, Shourie has shot off a missive which is learnt to allege that the BJP is in the hands of a coterie.        
	Senior, and disgruntled, leader Jaswant Singh began reading out the letter at a meeting of office-bearers this afternoon when Rajnath stopped him short, arguing it wasnt the proper forum to raise such matters.        
	Rajnath also made it plain he would not take it up for discussion at the national executive. Instead, he has formed a party committee headed by vice-president Bal Apte that will look into all the letters recently received by Rajnath raising contentious factional and organisational issues.        
	Shourie is believed to have demanded a debate on internal issues, the working of the party and the real reasons for its political debacle. Sources also revealed that the issue of Shouries letter was to be raised in a party meeting but Rajnath did not allow the circulation of the letter.        
	Shourie allegedly said the real issues plaguing the party were being brushed under the carpet and sought an open discussion.        
	He also demanded that Arun Jaitley, recently elevated to the rank of leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, be present at the national executive, something Jaitley, currently vacationing in Europe, is in no mood to oblige him on.        
	Also absent from the conclave will be Yashwant.        
	That the two leaders primarily responsible for the current turbulence in the party will be abstaining from the crucial meeting gives you an idea of what is happening in the party, an executive committee member said.        
	Former foreign minister Yashwant has quit all party posts in protest against its premium on failure  a dig, partly, against chief poll strategist Jaitleys elevation in the Rajya Sabha despite the election defeat. Not being an office-bearer, Yashwant would have needed a special invite to attend the conclave. He is on a visit to his constituency.        
	Jaitley too quit as BJP general secretary after being attacked for the poll debacle, the official reason for the resignation being he did not want to hold two jobs. He could still have attended the executive on the strength of his House post.        
	Many view Jaitleys resignation as a way of avoiding the meeting, which is likely to see demands to fix responsibility for the poll defeat.

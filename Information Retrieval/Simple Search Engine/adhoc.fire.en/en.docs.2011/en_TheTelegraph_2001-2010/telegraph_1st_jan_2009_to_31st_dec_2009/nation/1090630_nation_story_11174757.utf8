          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar June 29: Tension gripped the proposed Posco steel plant site, some 130km from the state capital, today after a late night clash left 15 people injured, eight of them seriously.        
	The clash broke out at Govindpur near Paradip few hours after midnight after when Posco supporters entered an argument with a rival group. While arrests in this connection are yet to be made, inspector Anil Mishra of Kujung police station confirmed that some people had been injured.        
	Those seriously hurt have been shifted to the Kujang hospital, he said, adding that interrogation into the incidents was on and action would be taken against those guilty.        
	On May 14, members of Posco Pratirodh Sangram Samiti and members of the pro-Posco group had come to blows at the same village.         
	Posco signed an MoU with the Orissa government on June 22, 2005, to set up a 12-million tonne steel plant with an investment of Rs 51,000 crore near Paradip. However, resistance from residents stalled construction work since then.         
	The project area, spread over 15 villages in three gram panchayats  Govindpur being one of them  under Ersama block, had been out of bounds for government staff, police and Posco officials till November 2008.         
	Though socio-economic survey and land demarcation has been completed, construction is awaiting court clearance for the allocation of 3,000 acre of forestland.

          SUJAN DUTTA                                    (From top) Chinese guided missile destroyers Haikou and Wuhan, which reportedly forced an Indian kilo-class submarine to surface off the coast of Africa				                                 
	New Delhi, Feb. 4: An Indian submarine played cat-and-mouse with two Chinese warships off the coast of Africa last month before it was spotted and forced to surface in the latest round of cold-war games between the two countries.        
	Neither India nor China has officially confirmed or denied the reports. But Chinese media have reported the incident and an Indian Navy source has said we do not discuss our deployments.        
	Two guided missile destroyers of the navy of Chinas Peoples Liberation Army were earlier this month deployed to the Gulf of Aden and in the waters off Somalia to escort Chinese merchant vessels crossing the piracy-threatened stretch.        
	This was the first time that Chinese warships were sailing up the Arabian Sea, so close to India, after setting off from Hainan, the base of Chinas southern fleet, and passing through the Straits of Malacca. The Haikou and the Wuhan destroyers were also accompanied by a supply ship and are prepared for a long deployment.        
	When the Russian-origin kilo-class Indian submarine started spooking the Chinese warships is not known. But the Qingdao Chenbao, a Chinese daily, reported that the submarine was forced to surface on January 15 near the Bab Al-Mandab Strait after more than 30 minutes of manoeuvres. The kilo-class diesel-electric submarines are the quietest in Indias fleet.        
	There are many ways of tracking ships and I can tell you that the submarine that surfaced was not ours, a senior Indian naval officer said. It is unlikely that the Indian  or any other navy  would admit that they were spooking another navys warships. Navies also use maritime reconnaissance aircraft to track the movement of ships.        
	The officer said India does monitor the movement of warships on the Indian Ocean sailing from the Straits of Malacca to the Gulf of Aden and the other way round.        
	China itself adopts such tactics. In November 2007, China shocked the Pentagon when one of its Song-class submarines surfaced within sight of the aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk during exercises in the Pacific between Japan and Taiwan.                    
	The Chinese submarine had broken through the protective shield that US aircraft carriers have around them as they sail in battlegroups.        
	The South China Morning Post reported that when the Chinese destroyers spotted the Indian submarine armed with 20 torpedoes they scrambled onboard anti-submarine helicopters. It was only after that the submarine surfaced.         
	Indian Navy officers say their warships are often buzzed by aircraft  sometimes from Pakistan  when they sail through the Gulf. Between India and Pakistan, this is almost a routine.         
	But the rarity of the event with the Chinese arises from the rarity of the Chinese deployment in the Arabian Sea. While the piracy off Somalia has given China good reason to send its navy up Indias western seaboard, the presence of the Chinese ships offers the Indian Navy an opportunity to record their signatures.

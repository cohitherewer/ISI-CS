The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | A piece of India, near ice continent

	New Delhi, Aug. 20: A micro  continent that lies submerged   beneath the southern Indian   Ocean near Antarctica was   once a part of the Indian land  mass that was sundered and   sunk by ancient geological   processes, studies have re  vealed.  
	 Scientists from India, the   US and Australia have recon  structed the history of the   break-away micro-continent   using clues from the Bay of   Bengal, Indias Eastern Ghat   mountains, and the undersea   plateau that seafloor mappers   have named Elan Bank.				   
	Elan Bank is about 140,000   square kilometres in area    nearly the size of Bangladesh   and lies about 1,200m below   the sea surface, about 1,000km   from eastern Antarctica.				   
	In the latest study, scien  tists from the National Insti  tute of Oceanography, Goa,   and the Space Applications   Centre, Ahmedabad, have de  scribed the tectonic history of   the breakup of India from   Antarctica 130 million years   ago and the excision of Elan   Bank from eastern India 120   million years ago. They re  ported their findings earlier   this year in the Journal of   Geophysical Research.  
	 All the evidence put to  gether tells us that Elan Bank   tore itself away from a region   along the east coast of India   between Orissa and Andhra   Pradesh, said Kolluru Sree   Krishna, a senior NIO scien  tist.  
	 The earliest hints of   Indias lost land had emerged   eight years ago when geo  chemists at the Massachusetts   Institute of Technology and   the Free University of Brus  sels had discovered fragments   of continental crust in Elan   bank rocks.  
	 It was a great surprise to   find continental crust deep   under the ocean, said Freder  ick Frey, professor of geo  chemistry at MIT. The rocks   from Elan Bank were old and   did not appear anything like   oceanic rocks, Frey told The   Telegraph.				   
	Frey and his collaborators,   Dominique Weis, a geo  chemist at the Free University   of Brussels and her doctoral   student Stephanie Ingle, pub  lished a paper in The Journal   of Petrology in 2002 where   they reported that chemical   signatures in rocks from the   Elan Bank have similarities   with rocks from Indias East  ern Ghats.  
	 A year later, Irina Borisso  va a scientist with Australias   national geological survey   generated fresh data to sup  port the continental origins of   Elan Bank . Geologists know   that oceanic crust is thinner   than continental crust. The   crust beneath the ocean is   only about 6km thick. Borisso  va found that Elan Bank crust   was at least 16km thick, and its   top two kilometres were made   up of volcanic rocks.  
	In their new study, Krishna   and his colleagues have used   gravity patterns and structur  al features beneath the seabed   in the Bay of Bengal to de  scribe how India first separat  ed from Gondwanaland  the   Australia-Antarctica-India su  percontinent  and then lost   Elan Bank.  
	 This new work adds geo  physical evidence for those   events, Frey said.  
	 India separated from   Gondwanaland about 130 mil  lion years ago and drifted   northward to eventually col  lide with Asia 40 million years   ago. But early during its move  ment, Elan Bank broke away.				   
	The Indian landmass is it  self made up of smaller conti  nental blocks  the Dharwar,   Bundelkhand, and Bastar cratons, among others. These are small landmasses that came together between two billion and four billion years ago to give India its peninsular shape  long before the era of Gondwanaland .  
	 The areas joining these cratons are relatively weak and may give way to tectonic adjustments, Krishna said. Elan Bank may have been such a distinct craton-like continental block that was a part of India.    As Indian continental plate continued to draft northward, Elan Bank remained close to Antarctica. Scientists are still unclear when it went under the sea, but the process is likely to have occurred over several million years.				   
	The studies by Borissova and her colleagues who have drilled into Elan Bank indicate that extensive volcanism occurred around 108 million years ago and significantly altered the micro-continent.  
	Volcanism may have contributed to the submergence of Elan Bank, said Krishna. Extensive volcanism would have added enormous weight to the micro-continent, which might have eventually caused it to sink into the sea, he said.

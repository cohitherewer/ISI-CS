          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 27: Bt brinjal is unsafe for human consumption and its release into the environment puts human and animal health at high risk, said US-based Institute of Responsible Technology executive director Jeffery Smith.        
	Smith requested a wake-up call, as Orissa was going to be the experiment ground for Bt brinjal cultivation.         
	Prompted by Bt seed dealers, primarily from neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, farmers here have been taking up commercial cultivation of Bt cotton in a big way. Orissa University of Agriculture and Technology has recently started research on genetically modified food and its commercial cultivation in the state.        
	The feedback from farmers in Bolangir, Rayagada and Nuapada districts of show erratic yields, failed cops, increased pest incidence, new diseases among others. Besides, there have been reports about death of cattle after grazing on harvested Bt cotton fields and those handling the crop have come down with severe allergies. While the situation resulting out of Bt cotton cultivation is getting increasingly critical, the government instead of halting the cultivation, is going to allow Bt brinjal in the state, Smith rued.        
	Bt Cotton was introduced in India in 2002 and five states, including Gujarat, Maharashtra, Punjab, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh, have officially allowed its commercial cultivation. While the Andhra Pradesh animal husbandry department admitted that the sheep deaths in Warangal district were caused by Bt toxin, doctors of Jana Swasthya Abhiyan in Madhya Pradesh have confirmed that Bt cotton is behind the allergies witnessed among cotton farmers there, Smith said.

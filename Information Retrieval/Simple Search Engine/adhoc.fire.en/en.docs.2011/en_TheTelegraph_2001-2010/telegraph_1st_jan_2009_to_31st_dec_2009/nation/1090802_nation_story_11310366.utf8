	Calcutta, Aug. 1: A CPM state committee meeting today witnessed several members asking for aged and ill ministers to be dropped and those with multiple portfolios to shed their extra burden, apparently under encouragement from the leadership.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and state CPM secretary Biman Bose stayed silent on the subject but party secretariat sources said the leadership had orchestrated these demands on the floor to break resistance to a shuffle within the ministry.        
	The secretariat is already discussing the need for changes, and some secretariat members who are also senior ministers have now volunteered to offload their additional burden, a leader said.        
	The committee, however, felt a shuffle alone would not suffice, and Bhattacharjee himself admitted a gap between his governments claims on development and the reality, blaming the partys weakened contact with the grassroots and the unreliability of bureaucratic feedback. Time is running out, he was quoted as saying.        
	According to sources who took part in the meeting, Bhattacharjee stressed speeding up the governments development and welfare projects that directly impact the lives of the poor but did not mention the changes needed in the ministry to achieve it.        
	Sources said power and labour minister Mrinal Banerjee and parliamentary affairs minister Sailen Sarkar, both seriously ill, and a few junior ministers such as Bankim Ghosh and Benoy Biswas were among those who could be dropped. Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty and health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra, who hold three portfolios each, are among senior ministers who may be asked to offload extra burden.        
	Party general secretary Prakash Karat and politburo member Sitaram Yechury attended the two-day meeting, which began today and will tomorrow discuss an organisational revamp and rectification campaign.        
	The meeting discussed possible course corrections in the functioning of the state government to win back the partys traditional support base among farmers and the rural poor before the 2011 Assembly polls.        
	Referring to his recent visits to the districts, Bhattacharjee said he could see the gulf between what the bureaucrats said about the governments delivery mechanism and the reality of rural Bengal.        
	Our process of party feedback based on contact with the grassroots has become weak and the governments dependence on the bureaucracy has increased, a participant quoted Bhattacharjee as saying.        
	Citing Lalgarh, Bhattacharjee said the funds allocated for development were sufficient but they were left largely unspent, the sources said. I have taken an initiative to rejuvenate the task force to execute projects on a war-footing in the troubled area. I hope to see a change in months, he said. Bhattacharjee, however, said the joint security operation would continue and that the state wanted the central forces to stay on for a few more months.         
	Some cautioned the government against taking over fertile land in the future. Bhattacharjee made it clear that no such drive would be undertaken without consulting the district party units. He expressed anguish and concern at the rising political violence in the state even as some members rued the police and administrative inactivity.        
	Karat spoke on the party central committees review of the factors behind the poll setbacks in Kerala and Bengal.         
	He urged his Bengal comrades not to be disheartened and highlighted the need to ensure speedy implementation of welfare projects. Karat also cautioned against retaliatory violence and asked the government and the party to galvanise the masses by focusing on the rural and urban poor.

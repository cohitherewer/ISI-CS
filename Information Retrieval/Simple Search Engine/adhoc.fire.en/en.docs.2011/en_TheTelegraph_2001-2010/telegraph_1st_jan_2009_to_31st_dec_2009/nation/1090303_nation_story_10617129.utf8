          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, March 2: With 40 Lok Sabha seats, Bihar will have its elections from April 16 to May 7, to be conducted in four phases, the Election Commission (EC) announced today.         
	The four-phase poll evoked a mixed reaction among officials. Some stressed that the phase-wise election will enable them to conduct a peaceful poll, others believed that the protracted exercise would keep the state machinery off work for a long time.         
	The first phase to start on April 16 will witness polling in 13 constituencies, while 13 more seats will be up for election in the second phase to start from April 23. The constituencies to undergo polling for the first and second phases are evenly divided through the north and south of the Ganga in Bihar.         
	The seats going to polls in the first phase include Gopalganj, Siwan, Maharajganj, Arra, Karakat, Jehanabad, Gaya, Jamui, Nawada, Saran, Aurangabad, Buxar and Sasaram. While Balmiki Nagar, East and West Champaran, Madhubani, Hajipur, Ujiyarpur, Samastipur, Sheohar, Seetamarhi, Jharkharpur, Vaishali, Darbhanga and Muzaffapur will go to polls on April 23.         
	As many as 11 constituencies will undergo polling in the third phase (April 30) in Supaul, Madhepura, Araria, Kishenganj, Khagaria, Katihar and in Purnea and border areas of Begusarai, Banka, Munger and Bhagalpur.         
	Only three seats  Nalanda, home to chief minister Nitish Kumar, Pataliputra and Patna Saheb  would go for polls in the final phase to start from May 7.         
	Chief minister Nitish Kumar said: We had suggested that the EC hold a three-phase poll in Bihar. But, we have no objection to ECs decision and will help them conduct a fair poll.         
	However, Nitish pointed out that an election conducted over a smaller period of time would have freed the government to get back to normality, sooner.

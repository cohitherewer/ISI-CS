The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | MBBS seat slash in the pipeline
                                                                                                               MBBS seat slash in the pipeline
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, July 12: The prospect of a slash in MBBS seats at VSS Medical College and Hospital by the Union health ministry has become imminent following the submission of an adverse compliance verification report by the Medical Council of India (MCI).        
	MCI teams had submitted compliance verification reports after inspecting the medical college in Burla, SCB Medical College in Cuttack and MKCG Medical College in Berhampur in May-June.        
	The reports had given clearance for 150 seats each in SCB Medical College and MKCG Medical College but recommended to the ministry for reduction of 43 seats in VSS Medical College as it failed to meet the requirements laid down by the MCI.        
	The MCI had noted persisting vacancies in teaching faculty with 14 posts of professors and three posts of associate professors lying vacant and inadequacies in infrastructure like shortage of beds in the casualty and other such lacunae, a senior health department official said.         
	The ministry had allowed the three state-run medical colleges to raise their respective intake from 107 to 150 for MBBS course.         
	But it was on condition expecting the institutions to meet the MCI norms every year for renewal of permission till completion of five years.        
	The VSS Medical College was allowed to increase intake from 107 to 150 in 2007-08 and 2008-09 academic sessions.         
	It wouldnt be surprising if the medical college is disallowed to continue with the increased intake this year as the SCB Medical College was prohibited for two academic sessions under similar circumstances, said a former director of medical education and training.        
	SCB Medical College was allowed to increase the seats from 107 to 150 in 2002-03. But the permission was not renewed for 2003-04 and 2004-05. Subsequently, it was allowed to retain the 150 seats uninterruptedly since 2005-06, official sources said.        
	Waking up to the threat of seat slash, the state government yesterday issued transfer orders of at least 17 doctors posted in different discipline at SCB Medical College and MKCG Medical College to VSS Medical College.        
	The transfer orders asked the doctors to join forthwith without availing joining time.         
	The BJD government in the state had come under heavy flak over the VSS Medical College MBBS seat issue. In fact, the Opposition, while moving notice for adjournment on Thursday, had squarely blamed the state government for failing to comply with the MCI stipulations since 2007.

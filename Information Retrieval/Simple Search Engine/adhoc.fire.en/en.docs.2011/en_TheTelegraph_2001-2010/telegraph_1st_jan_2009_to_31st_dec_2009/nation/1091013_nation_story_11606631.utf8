          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 12: Expressing concern over the lack of maintenance, chief minister Naveen Patnaik today urged Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to depute a team of experts to visit Konark temple and suggest remedial measures.        
	Chief minister wrote to the PM today following reports that a stone slab fell from the ancient temple on Sunday near the horse gate. The 12th century monument is being maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).         
	In his letter, the chief minister pointed out that Konark was a world heritage site. He added that the ASI was not taking appropriate steps for its upkeep.        
	He alleged that serious incidents such as the one that occurred on Sunday shows that there are lapses in the maintenance.         
	Under such circumstances, Naveen requested Singh to depute a high-level team to conduct a through check-up of the entire temple and draw up a long-term action plan for the preservation of the monument.        
	Sundays incident is not a one-of-a-kind in the state.        
	On June 4, 2009, four stone slabs had fallen from the temple, said members of Konark Suraksha Samiti, comprising locals who are fighting for proper maintenance of the monument.        
	However, ASI officials are now questioning the authenticity of the Sunday incident. Dismissing reports as baseless, ASI superintending archeologist A.K. Patel claimed that the Central agency was regular and meticulous in its maintenance task.         
	We have taken up several measures for conservation and beautification, he added.

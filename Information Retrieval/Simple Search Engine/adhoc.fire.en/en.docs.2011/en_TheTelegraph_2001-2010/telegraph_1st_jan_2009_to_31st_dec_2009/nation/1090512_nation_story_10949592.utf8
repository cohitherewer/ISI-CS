The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP slams Posco grant
                                                                                                               BJP slams Posco grant
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, May 11: The BJP today demanded penal action against chief minister Naveen Patnaik, and errant officials, for favouring South Korean steel maker Posco and violating the code of conduct by recommending a mine lease during polls.         
	In a memorandum submitted to the chief election commissioner (CEC), Alaka Panda, today, the BJP drew the CECs attention to an order granting prospective licence for 25sqkm of mines at Kandhahar in Sundargarh on April 19  between first and second phases of polls held on April 16 and 23.         
	However, state steel and mines minister Pradip Kumar Amat dismissed the allegations as baseless. The government has not violated any code and has not recommended any lease grant during the election. The order under reference was just in compliance with the court order in an ongoing case, said he.         
	Earlier, addressing a news conference today, BJP Orissa president Suresh Pujari alleged that the circumstances and timing of the order smacked of a malafide intention to favour a foreign multinational company. Circulating a copy of an official note sheet and the April 19 order, supposedly passed by Naveen, Pujari claimed that concerned file was initiated on April 2, cleared by the chief secretary on April 4, and was put up before the steel and mines minister. Pujari, who was in the middle of his campaigning at Boudh, rushed to Bhubaneswar to put his signature the very next day.         
	The file was with the chief ministers office for 13 days (from April 5-19) and Naveen allegedly put his signature on April 19. He did not get any prior approval of the Election Commission, alleged the BJP president.         
	The chief minister owes an explanation to the people of Orissa regarding the urgency of his decision and that too, three days prior to the polls, said former minister Bijoy Mohapatra.               
	Former union steel minister Braja Kishore Tripathy said the government had flouted guidelines that state a lease will not be recommended unless those invested spent at least 25 per cent of the total project cost.         
	While files related to mining leases in favour of Rourkela Steel Plant and Kudermukh Iron Company Limited are still pending, Posco files have been cleared in no times, he added.         
	BJP national vice-president and former union minister Jual Oram alleged that a kick back was involved in the deal.         
	BJP leader and former industries minister Biswa Bhusan Harichandan urged the Election Commission to stay the controversial order, call for all Posco records and leases and summon the chief minister, the departmental ministers and officials for an explanation.

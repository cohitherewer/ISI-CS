                                                                                                               Chennai   cheer for Congress
          G.C. SHEKHAR                                    
	Chennai, March 28: The Congress received a fillip today after the alliance fiascos in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, with the DMK allotting it 16 seats in Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry, six more than the 10 it had contested in 2004.        
	The deal was clinched at a two-hour meeting between Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad and DMK president M. Karunanidhi. The DMK will contest 21 seats, six more than in 2004. The increased shares were made possible by the PMK, MDMK and the Left parties quitting the front.        
	We are more than satisfied with the formula, Azad said. The Congress will contest 15 of Tamil Nadus 39 constituencies and the lone Pondicherry seat, which went to the PMK the last time. Dalit party VCK will contest two and the Muslim League one.        
	Karunanidhi said the constituencies would be identified in a few days. He was confident the alliance would sweep all 40 seats, as in 2004.        
	Sudden siblings        
	PMK chief S. Ramadoss today met Jayalalithaa with a bouquet and addressed her as dear sister, eight years after dubbing her a rotten apple. The ADMK chief addressed Ramadoss as Doctor annan (elder brother).        
	In 2001 too Ramadoss had come to meet her with a bouquet after the Assembly polls had returned Jayalalithaa to power. Ramadoss wanted a Rajya Sabha seat for son Anbumani, but she made him wait an hour at the secretariat before turning him down.

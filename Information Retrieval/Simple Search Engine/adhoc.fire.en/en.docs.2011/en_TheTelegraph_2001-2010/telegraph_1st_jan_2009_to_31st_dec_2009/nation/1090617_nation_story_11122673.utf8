The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Plea to divert quota cash
                                                                                                               Plea to divert quota cash
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, June 16: The human resource development ministry that shepherded OBC reservations in higher education now wants fresh funds intended for the quota implementation to be diverted for new institutions it is setting up.         
	The HRD ministry plans to ask the finance ministry to allocate a majority of the fund hike it is expected to receive in the upcoming budget for the new institutions. Top officials said the HRD ministry was desperately short on finances to run the new campuses while sitting on more than Rs 1,500 crore of unused money for OBC quotas.         
	We want the expected increase in our allocation to focus on new institutions and not on the OBC expansions. Any more money for the reservations will only lie idle, a top HRD ministry official said.         
	The ministry was allocated Rs 7,600 crore for higher education in 2008-09 and was allocated an identical amount for this financial year under the interim budget presented in February. Of this amount Rs 2,522 crore, nearly a third of the total higher education budget, was allocated for expansion in infrastructure to meet an increase in students because of the OBC quotas.         
	The OBC quota law requires central institutions to increase their student intake by 54 per cent to ensure that there is no reduction in seats for general category students.         
	However, the HRD ministry has failed to utilise most of the funds allocated for the quota expansion. The Telegraph on October 16 last year first reported that the finance ministry had rapped the HRD ministry for failing to utilise most of the quota funds.         
	At present, the HRD ministry has over Rs 700 crore unused OBC quota funds for the National Institutes of Technology and over Rs 800 crore for the IITs, sources said. Rules dictate that this money cannot be utilised for any other project, such as funding any of the eight new IITs, six new IIMs or 10 new NITs that the ministry is starting.         
	During discussions for the interim budget, the HRD ministry had asked finance minister Pranab Mukherjee to allocate Rs 2,000 crore over the Rs 7,600 crore for higher education last year, a ministry source said. But the finance ministry cited the Centres funds crunch to allocate Rs 7,600 crore exactly.         
	The HRD ministry is now, however, set to receive the extra Rs 2,000 crore for higher education, according to indications from the finance ministry and the Planning Commission, top officials said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Court rap for state clinic
                                                                                                               Court rap for state clinic
  - Hospital fails to implement waste management norms          OUR CORRESPONDENT      
	Cuttack, Oct. 11: Treatment and disposal of biomedical waste continues to be a half-hearted affair at SCB Medical College and Hospital.        
	The hospital was the first in the state to adopt biomedical waste management and handling rules nearly a decade ago. But it has since shown laxity in implementing the same. The high court has been monitoring treatment and disposal of biomedical waste while adjudicating a PIL.         
	The court had appointed advocate P.R. Das as amicus curie to submit periodic reports on the status of the disposal system at SCB.         
	While biomedical waste were being disposed without properly segregating it into different coloured bags, as is mandatory, also syringes were not being broken and needles were not being cut before being discarded. The incinerator installed at the hospital two years ago has not been functioning for some months now. But it was neither repaired nor replaced.        
	Though certain amount of waste was being segregated, it was not done uniformly in all wards, hospital officials concede.         
	In fact, SCB Medical College and Hospital is among the 27 private and government-run hospitals that had been issued notices by Orissa State Pollution Control Board recently for violation of biomedical waste (management and handling) rules.         
	The board which oversees waste treatment facilities in hospitals also submitted a report, following which the high court recently directed the government to set up a liquid biomedical waste treatment plant in the hospital.         
	Hospital superintendent D.N. Maharana, however, said steps are underway to streamline treatment and disposal. The hospital was the first to implement the bio-waste rules, it would take some time for the system to start functioning without lapses, he said.         
	The hospital administration had out-sourced treatment and disposal of biomedical wastes to a private party and was spending around Rs 1 lakh per month for it. Sources said the hospital was being charged Rs 2.95 paise per day per bed. The hospital has 1,249 beds.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Coconuts amp; chants to ring in Raju
                                                                                                               Coconuts amp; chants to ring in Raju
  - Priest flown in from Andhra          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Pallam Raju (right) takes over as junior defence minister after a puja by a priest flown in from Andhra                                         
	New Delhi, June 1: Three coconuts were cracked  one at the door of the first floor South Block office, one under the desk and one under the chair  and Sanskrit verses recited as Mallipudi Mangapati Pallam Raju took over as junior defence minister at the auspicious minute of 8.36am.        
	Pallam Raju will serve his second stint as minister of state  as he did his first  under an atheist senior, A.K. Antony. Raju is the only junior defence minister this time.         
	Rao Inderjit Singh, who was minister of state for defence production, has been left out in the cold, though he has been re-elected.        
	Raju, an electronics engineer and a management graduate from Temple University, Philadelphia, flew in a priest from his constituency in Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh, for the shubh muhurat.         
	He was sworn in on May 28, but had been waiting for the right moment.        
	His brief this time is likely to be bigger as there is no minister for defence production. Last time, he was in charge of the Border Roads Organisation. This evening, his job description was being finalised.        
	But immediately after taking over and distributing laddoos and barfis, Raju expressed concern at a US congressional research report that said Pakistans nuclear arsenal was increasing. He said there should be diplomatic pressure on Islamabad. It was known, he said, that China and Pakistan were collaborating, but India was keeping a watch.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rage as 4 held for ragging 
                                                                                                               Rage as 4 held for ragging 
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, March 14: Some 200 students of an engineering college demonstrated before police today, demanding the release of four girls detained after a junior alleged ragging and attempted suicide.        
	The protesters claimed that first-year student M. Triveni, 20, had made up the story about being forced to dance naked in her hostel.        
	The parents of Triveni, who drank hair dye two weeks ago and is still in hospital, denied their daughter was lying, and appeared to be backed up by a hostel employee.        
	The demonstration before the police headquarters in Bapatla, 320km from Hyderabad, by students of the Government Agriculture Engineering College lasted an hour.        
	Shortly afterwards, however, the police formally arrested all the four senior girls under anti-ragging laws, senior officers said. A fifth accused is apparently out of town.        
	The agitating students claimed Triveni had been using ragging as an excuse after failing in three papers in the recently released first semester results.        
	Its a lie that she was asked to dance nude. She is only passing the blame for her failure in studies on her seniors, a girl student alleged.        
	Trivenis parents claimed she had been asked to dance for six hours, and that college authorities had brushed her complaint aside. The parents alleged that after Triveni drank the dye and was taken to hospital, the college did not inform them for two days till her condition worsened.        
	Police sources said a hostel employee had confirmed the college tried to hush up the suicide bid. The employee said Triveni, who comes from rural Srikakulam, had been the butt of jokes because of her accent.

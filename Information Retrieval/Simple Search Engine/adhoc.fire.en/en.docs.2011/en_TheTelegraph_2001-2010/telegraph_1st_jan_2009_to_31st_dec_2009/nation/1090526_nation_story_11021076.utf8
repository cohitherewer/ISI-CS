The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Taj Mahal becomes disabled friendly 
                                                                                                               Taj Mahal becomes disabled friendly 
          CITHARA PAUL                                    
	New Delhi, May 25: Many people with disabilities who came to see the Taj Mahal could only gaze at it from the entrance. Not any more.        
	The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), custodian of the 17th-century monument to love, has now built ramps leading into the mausoleum so that the differently able can have a closer view.        
	Nine ramps of different sizes and lengths have been built, the longest being 48 feet. Around 40 wheelchairs have also been made available.         
	According to Javed Pervesh, an ASI official, around 30 physically challenged tourists come to see the Taj on a daily average. We are planning to advertise the new avatar of the Taj and we are sure that the new Taj Mahal is all the more attractive (for the ramps), he said.         
	The initiative to make the Taj disabled-friendly started in September last year.         
	Pervesh said foreign tourists with disabilities who come to visit the Taj bring their own motorised wheelchairs and move around freely without assistance.        
	But that is not the case with most domestic tourists. We have seen many such tourists who feel disappointed at not being able to have a closer look. Some even cry. Seeing all this, we took the decision to make the Taj disabled-friendly.        
	Activists working for the welfare of the physically challenged lauded the ASIs initiative.        
	It is rarely that we get to see such gestures. We appreciate this, said Javed Abidi, who has headed several campaigns for the disabled and is now spearheading a campaign to make Parliament disabled-friendly.        
	Many heritage monuments and tourist spots across the world  like the Coliseum (Rome) and Disneyland (California)  are already disabled-friendly.

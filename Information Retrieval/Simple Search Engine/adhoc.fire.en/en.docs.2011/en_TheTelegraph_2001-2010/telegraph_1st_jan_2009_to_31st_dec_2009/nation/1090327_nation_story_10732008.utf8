The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Advani debate dare
                                                                                                               Advani debate dare
                                          
	Seppa, Arunachal Pradesh, March 26 (PTI): L.K. Advani today dared Manmohan Singh to a live TV debate, similar to the ones presidential rivals have in the US.        
	Advani (in picture) threw the gauntlet at an election rally here, where he again dubbed the Congress leader the weakest Prime Minister the country ever had.        
	The BJPs prime ministerial candidate said he was ready for a live televised debate on an entire range of issues. Advani also said Singh should enter Parliament by contesting Lok Sabha polls, instead of taking the Rajya Sabha route.         
	He said Singh would be more acceptable to the common people if he became a member of the lower House.        
	Congress spokesperson Jayanti Natrajan said it showed the BJP seemed to be obsessed with everything US, but added that it was up to the Prime Minister to respond to the challenge.

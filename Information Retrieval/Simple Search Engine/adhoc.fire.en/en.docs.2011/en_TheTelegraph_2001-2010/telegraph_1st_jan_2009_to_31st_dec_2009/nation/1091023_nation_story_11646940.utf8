The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP adrift in denial mood
                                                                                                               BJP adrift in denial mood
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              Sushma Swaraj and Vijay Goel				                                 
	New Delhi, Oct. 22: As it lurched to its latest poll debacle, the BJP appeared stunned by the enormity of the Maharashtra defeat and was wringing its hands at what might have been in Haryana.        
	In 2004, the BJP-Shiv Sena had notched a respectable 116 seats but this time the combine got stuck at 90. The BJP can hardly take consolation from winning two seats more than the Sena, or from having doubled its Haryana tally from two to four.        
	In Haryana, former ally Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), whom the BJP had dumped after the Lok Sabha polls, won 32 of 90 seats  just eight less than the Congress, which failed to gain absolute majority. In any post-mortem of the mistakes that led to the alliances severance, the feeling will be inescapable that the party may have missed a golden opportunity to put the Congress under pressure in Haryana.        
	Expectedly, the BJPs response to todays defeats was a laconic: We have to reflect on our weaknesses and analyse the verdict with humility.        
	The closest spokesman Ravi Shankar Prasad came to a hint at the weaknesses was: For the sake of our workers and supporters, we must speak in one voice.        
	Sources, however, said that the lack of verbal consonance was just one of the issues.        
	Its the tip of the iceberg. The problems run deeper and have to be handled with (a degree of) honesty, integrity and ruthlessness that nobody at the top seems capable of at the moment, a source said.        
	The party put off a meeting of its parliamentary board (its apex decision-making body) that was to discuss just one of the many decisions facing it  the resignation of Vasundhara Raje. We are in denial mode as always, a source acknowledged.        
	In Maharashtra, the BJP is officially blaming the defeat on the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena dividing the Opposition votes, but sources privately concede that the reasons run deeper. They have to do with the leadership crisis blighting both partners.        
	If the BJPs Delhi brass was confused, its Maharashtra leaders Gopinath Munde and Nitin Gadkari, who buried their differences for the campaign, failed to lift worker morale, sources said. Neither leader has the stature of Pramod Mahajan, the only BJP heavyweight Maharashtra had thrown up. As for the Sena, Balasaheb is a shadow of himself. He has been unable to come to grips with the emergence of Raj . He was not visible during the elections, save on voting day, a source said.        
	Asked if the BJP would fix culpability, and at what level, a source answered: When we havent done anything after two successive Lok Sabha setbacks, how big a deal are the Assembly polls?        
	There is, however, concern at the way the Haryana alliance was handled, first by Sushma Swaraj and later Vijay Goel, the general secretary looking after the state.        
	Sushma had persuaded the leadership to dump Om Prakash Chautalas INLD. Goel had dallied briefly with Bhajan Lals outfit but turned cold after he insisted that his son, Kuldeep Bishnoi, be projected as the candidate for chief minister.        
	Indications, however, are that far from being prodded into action, the BJP will remain passive till a new president takes over from Rajnath Singh at the year-end.

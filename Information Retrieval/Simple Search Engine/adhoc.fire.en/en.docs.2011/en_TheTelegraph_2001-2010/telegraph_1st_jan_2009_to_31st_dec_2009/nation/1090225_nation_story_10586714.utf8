          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Feb. 24: The agitation begun by the members of Orissa Police Havildar Constable and Sepoys Confederation intensified after receiving the support of the Orissa Police Association.         
	The association would be supporting the confederations strike and cease work call. After a daylong fast, the confederation had served an ultimatum to the government threatening to cease work from February 25, if their pay-related demands were not met by then.         
	The cease work threat assumes significance as the confederation draws its members from the 40,000 employees and members of Orissa police and Orissa State Armed Police from the ranks of havildars, constables and sepoys. The Orissa Police Association constitutes officers in the ranks of assistant sub-inspectors, sub-inspectors and inspectors.         
	We are left with no option but to go in for the strike as our demands have not been addressed even after the February 9 fast in which family members participated as well, said confederation president Padmanav Behera.                          
	At the same time we had also served a notice to the government and had demanded the formation of a committee to review the salary structure of ground-level staff. But no one heard our requests, he added. The association supported the confederations demands at a general body meeting on Sunday. A co-ordination committee constituted since then has threatened to continue the strike for an indefinite period.        
	Though a fitment committee report was accepted by the state in December 2008 to revise pay scales of state employees according to the recommendations of the Sixth Pay Commission,no change was noticed.        
	The government had ended up granting constables a revised pay packet that was at least Rs 3,000 less than his counterpart in the Centre.         
	Also, the salary of a sub-inspector was similar to that of a peon at the Centre, inspectors were granted less salary than their counterparts in the Centre, rued members of the coordination committee.

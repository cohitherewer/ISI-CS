	New Delhi, June 30: A recession-hit shoe exporter teamed up with his three former Delhi University friends to kidnap his cousin for a Rs 25-lakh ransom before the hostage fled and the two accomplices were arrested.        
	Navin Singh, 25, lured his cousin, banker Rahul Kumar, 22, on the pretext of having a party, police said.        
	He sent his friend, Kuldeep Sharma, 26, to pick Rahul up outside his bank on Friday and kept him hostage for two days at various places between Delhi and Haryanas Bahadurgarh. Rahul managed to flee from there yesterday.         
	Navin and Kuldeep were held soon after and charged with kidnapping for ransom. The offence is non-bailable and carries punishment of up to a life term.         
	Two more youths are still at large. According to Delhi police officers, the four had planned to murder Rahul after the ransom was paid.         
	The officials said orders for Navins shoe exports had dried up since the downturn deepened late last year. Kuldeep had no such problems: he worked in a call centre and was doing well for himself, but the lure of easy money from crime proved too tempting.        
	Navin had run up huge losses because of the meltdown while Kuldeep had debts of over Rs 5 lakh. Kuldeep earned quite a bit but their lifestyles of partying and shopping led them to want more. They, along with the two others, planned this, said deputy commissioner of police (south district) H.G.S. Dhaliwal.        
	Navins family in Haryana has real estate business worth crores, Dhaliwal said, adding Kuldeeps parents in Delhi were just as well off.        
	Rahul was last seen by colleagues at HDFC Banks Vasant Kunj branch in south Delhi, getting onto a bike with Manoj, one of the two yet to be arrested.        
	On Sunday afternoon, his 54-year-old-father, Suresh Kumar, received calls saying his son had been kidnapped and that he pay up Rs 25 lakh to get him back. The family informed the police.        
	The caller spoke in Bihari (the Kumars hail from Bihar) and seemed to know the familys financial and personal backgrounds. This raised our suspicion that it could be a person related to the family, said Dhaliwal. The suspicion fell on Navin.         
	Rahul was being moved around places in Navins Alto, first between Delhi and Haryanas Rohtak and finally Bahadurgarh. Rahul was also hurt during the scuffles he had in the car and while being taken in and out of hideouts, said Dhaliwal.         
	Seven teams tracked the calls made on Sunday, during which the kidnappers kept changing the point where they wanted the ransom paid.        
	Finally, Navins cellphone was tracked to Bahadurgarh, but before the cops could get there, Rahul escaped. The cops got Navin and Kuldeep, not the other two.        
	During interrogation, it emerged that Kuldeep had made the ransom calls. Navin, fearing he would be recognised easily, never came into the picture but co-ordinated all the planning and movements. The ransom was to be equally divided among the four.

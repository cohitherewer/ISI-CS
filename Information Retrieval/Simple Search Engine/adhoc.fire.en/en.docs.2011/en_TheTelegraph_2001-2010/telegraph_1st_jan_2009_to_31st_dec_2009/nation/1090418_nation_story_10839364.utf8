The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP toys with Varun leash
                                                                                                               BJP toys with Varun leash
          SANJAY K. JHA                           Varun: Still a debutant?                                  
	New Delhi, April 17: A cautious BJP is reluctant to exploit the newfound stardom of Varun Gandhi because it feels that shifting focus from the peoples miseries would help the Congress.         
	Most middle-rung leaders want Varun to be reined in because they are wary of his growing popularity among hardcore Sangh parivar workers. Arun Jaitley, the BJPs key strategist, has made it clear that the campaign would firmly focus on the UPAs failures in governance.         
	Internal surveys by the party show that economic issues, mainly food prices and unemployment, remain the biggest concern of the majority of voters, followed by national security and agriculture.         
	The party is convinced that ideological issues should only be used symbolically for regrouping the committed Hindutva constituency.         
	The BJP sought to buttress its argument by pointing out that the five short films released by the party today for the electronic media revolved around governance issues. The films, shown to the media, deal with themes like the girl child, rice for the poor, tax relief, black money and farmers.         
	BJP spokesperson Sidharthnath Singh claimed no campaign material focused on ideological issues because the leadership wanted to fight the election on the plank of governance.         
	Another spokesperson Balbir Punj dismissed suggestions that the BJP was planning to launch a propaganda to exploit the controversy sparked by Varun. He said the party believed that the application of the National Security Act was disproportionate and vindictive and that the message had reached the people.         
	Asked if Varun would campaign in other constituencies, Punj said: Campaigning by Varun in other constituencies will depend on his comfort level. It is between the candidates and Varun because the party is not using him as a star campaigner.        
	Although Varun is in demand in Uttar Pradesh, sources said he would not get much time because his 15-day parole would be spent in Pilibhit and mother Maneka Gandhis constituency of Aonla.        
	Varun clarified that he did not plan to target the minorities. Let me make it clear I do not and have never advocated violence as a tool in politics. What I have advocated, and firmly stand by, is that all Indians should unite to face the threat of terrorism from neighbouring countries, he said in a statement.        
	We need to rise and face this menace boldly and I shall continue to raise my voice against anti-national forces.         
	He also sent a reminder to the party that he was now more than a debutant struggling to win his seat. His statement said: The immediate task is to help return (elect) a government that will be in the best interests of India.         
	 Varun did not forget to invoke his family legacy either. History shows that my family has always been strengthened by times of adversity. I, too, am being tested and shall not be found wanting, he said.        
	Welcoming the relief granted by the Supreme Court, he said he was looking forward to shortly being fully vindicated by the highest court of the land in regard to this illegal detention.

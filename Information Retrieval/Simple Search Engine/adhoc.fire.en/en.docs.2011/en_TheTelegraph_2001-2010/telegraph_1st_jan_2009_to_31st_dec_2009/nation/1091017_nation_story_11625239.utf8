          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 16: Foreign secretary Nirupama Rao today said India and China were determined to resolve their border dispute through dialogue, and sources suggested Manmohan Singh and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao would meet soon.        
	The developments come days after Delhi protested a Chinese statement criticising the Prime Ministers trip to Arunachal Pradesh, which Beijing claims as its own territory, and against the backdrop of Indian media reports of border incursions by China.        
	Sources said Singh would meet Wen on the sidelines of the Asean and East Asia summits this month. Petroleum minister Murli Deora, who met Wen in Beijing on Wednesday, said the Chinese leader had shown keen interest in meeting the Prime Minister during the Asean summit in Thailand, where Singh will travel on October 24.        
	Rao told All India Radio: I can say it with all honesty (that) both governments are convinced that there is no other way to resolve this without dialogue.        
	She said there had to be a realistic acknowledgement that there were differences between the two countries on their perception of the Line of Actual Control (LAC).        
	It is a good development and it is a positive factor that both countries are determined to resolve these issues, she said.

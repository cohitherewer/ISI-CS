The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Enter, vice-chief and next boss buzz
                                                                                                               Enter, vice-chief and next boss buzz
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 1: The most decorated soldier in the Indian Army took over as its vice-chief today.         
	When Lieutenant General P.C. Bhardwaj took office today, speculation on whether his appointment would cut the chances of Lieutenant General V.K. Singh, currently army commander in Fort William, Calcutta, to be the next chief, was revived.         
	Singh is the senior-most army commander and is next in line to take over from General Deepak Kapoor as the army chief. An army chief need not have served as vice chief, sources at the army headquarters said, and the eastern army commander continues to be the next in line for the top post.         
	An official announcement on the next chiefs appointment will be due only early next year.         
	An army media release today described Bhardwaj, who was the northern army commander based in Udhampur, as the most decorated soldier in the Indian Army.         
	The general has several firsts in his list of accomplishments. He was commissioned in the First Battalion the Parachute Regiment on June 14, 1970. A special operations expert, he was the first army officer to go through a commando divers course at Naval Diving School. He excelled in the course and qualified as an instructor.         
	Bhardwaj was awarded the Vir Chakra for conspicuous bravery as a second lieutenant in the 1971 war with Pakistan.

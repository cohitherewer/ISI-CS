	New Delhi, May 28: India flexed its muscle in the international arms bazaar today, telling Russia and Israel, its biggest suppliers, that new purchases of equipment would depend on timely delivery of pending orders.        
	Defence minister A.K. Antony turned a celebratory event  the induction ceremony of the Phalcon airborne warning and control system (AWACS), a joint venture between Russia and Israel for the Indian Air Force  into a stage to point fingers at the two sellers who have been frequently slipping on delivery schedules.        
	The Indian defence establishment opened a new season of big-ticket military purchases this week. Over the next five years, the army, navy and air force are embarking on a modernisation programme that could see more than $50 billion spent in new military technology. It could also mark a major shift from a dependence on mostly Russian military technology to western military technology.        
	The delivery of the Phalcon AWACS, an Israeli system mounted on the Russian IL-76 aircraft, is 18 months late.        
	Looking at the ambassadors of Russia and Israel who were in the audience at the air force terminal at Delhi airport this morning, Antony said: This agreement (to procure the system) was signed in 2004. It is five years. Now five years is too long a time. There are two more AWACS that are yet to be delivered. I hope they will be on time.        
	The ambassadors of Russia and Israel are here. I wish to convey my anxieties over the delays in the supply of equipment. I can say that if deliveries are on time there will be more orders.        
	Defence secretary Vijay Singh is scheduled to lead a team from the ministry and the navy to Moscow on Sunday for meetings to hasten deliveries of military hardware India has contracted from Russia that have slipped on schedule.         
	Antony said that in his last meeting with the Russian defence minister, there was an agreement to hasten deliveries. However, the Gorshkov aircraft carrier price hike is still being negotiated after the Russians asked for an additional $2.9 billion.        
	Antony said he was seeking to convey to all military suppliers that we have to further speed up the procurement as the security scenario around us demands that we must equip our armed forces with most modern equipment.

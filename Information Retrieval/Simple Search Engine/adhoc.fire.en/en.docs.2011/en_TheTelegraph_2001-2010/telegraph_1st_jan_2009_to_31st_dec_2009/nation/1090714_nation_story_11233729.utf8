          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Metro chief Sreedharan at the crash site. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, July 13: Gammon India, the contractor of the Metro line in south Delhi, has come under the scrutiny of the central government.        
	We will not spare anybody. When I say anybody, it is anybody that includes Gammon India, provided we receive a report by the committee, said urban development minister S. Jaipal Reddy.        
	If found guilty, the punishment could range from a ban that prevents the contractor from undertaking future projects to fines.        
	Gammon India, which claims to have constructed the foundation of the Gateway of India in Mumbai, had been under the scanner twice earlier. The company was probed for alleged lapses that led to the collapse of scaffolding in an under-construction flyover in Hyderabad in September 2007. It was also served a notice by Patna High Court in 2006, on the basis of a PIL, for allegedly using substandard materials to construct a bridge linking the Bihar capital with Hajipur.        
	Gammon India is headed by Abhijit Rajan, who sources said was a classmate of industrialist Anil Ambani. Originally from Allahabad, Rajan stays near Amitabh Bachchans house in Mumbai.        
	Gammon India has issued a statement saying the company would co-operate completely with the investigations.        
	We followed the highest safety measures and have safety engineers. Prima facie, I dont find any mistake on our part, said Umesh Gupta, the vice-president of Gammon India.        
	Sources familiar with the Delhi Metro project said even if a ban was imposed, it was unlikely to change matters on the ground.        
	Delhi Metro, which has to complete the project before the Commonwealth Games in October next year, has only a few big contractors on board who can handle this kind of work. How will they finish if they start banning companies? Its also a fact that since very few of them meet the criteria, they are overloaded with work both here and abroad, said a Metro official.        
	Even after a committee probing an October 2008 Metro accident in the capital blamed another contractor, Afcons Infrastructure, the company was not blacklisted completely.        
	The contractor was only banned from pitching for any new projects for one year.        
	At that time, E. Sreedharan, the chief of the Delhi Metro Railway Corporation, had conceded that it was virtually impossible to blacklist companies. Removing the agency would have adversely affected our expansion plans. We have blacklisted them for a year and may even extend it later, he had said.        
	Gammon India is the main contractor not only for the section that collapsed yesterday, but is also handling a corridor connecting the line to Noida.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, May 23: A four-member medical board today started an inquiry into the curious case of a 12-year-old boy whose parents have alleged that his right kidney was allegedly removed after an appendicitis operation three years ago.        
	Preliminary investigations indicated that Abhinash Natha was admitted to a nursing home in Cuttack on October 29, 2006. A surgery was performed on him to remove his appendix on October 31 and he was discharged on November 11, 2006.        
	While an ultrasound test before the surgery had shown two kidneys, a post-operation test conducted later  the boy complained of pain in his abdomen  showed the boy was left with only one kidney.        
	D.N. Mishra, a paediatric surgeon of the SCB Medical College Hospital, had performed the appendix surgery at the nursing home in Deula Sahi. He had taken the nursing home on lease from one Dr Guru Mohanty and was running it for the past three years.        
	Both have been detained for interrogation. Efforts are on to locate the anaesthetist and the nurse who were present during the operation, the police said.        
	Abhinashs father, Babuli Natha of Tirtol in Jagatsinghpur district, lodged his complaint before the Cuttack-Bhubaneswar commissioner of police on Thursday. Cuttack DCP A.N. Sinha referred the case to a medical board.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJD boys debut in House 
                                                                                                               BJD boys debut in House 
          LALMOHAN PATNAIK                               
	Cuttack, May 19: Sons are rising in coastal Orissa.        
	Nearly all of them in their early forties, the scions of three prominent leaders made their debut this time and successfully made it to the Orissa Assembly.         
	Veteran JD(U) leader late Ashok Dass son, Pranab, won from Jajpur constituency on a BJD ticket.         
	His father a Biju loyalist who had won from the neighbouring Korei in 1977, 1980, 1990, 1995 and 2000, passed away in December 2008.         
	I am grateful that Naveen Patnaik bestowed his blessings on me at a time when the political stage is set to welcome new entrants, said Pranab.         
	Voters of Korei (Jajpur) had voted a BJP candidate in 2004. But this time they voted in favour of Pritiranjan, the son of Prafulla Ghadei, another prominent BJD leader.         
	It was the good governance that enabled me to win, said the junior Ghadei humbly, after winning the elections. His father is the finance minister, who won from neighbouring Sukinda for the fifth consecutive time.         
	Senior BJD leader Kalindi Beheras son Chandrasarathi Behera won from Salipur constituency in Cuttack.         
	His father shifted to Cuttack (Sadar) seat reserved for Scheduled Castes after his constituency  Salipur was de-reserved.         
	But, BJD strategist Pyarimohan Mohapatra picked up junior Behera for Salipur and the move paid off.         
	Senior Behera who was elected from Cuttack Sadar seat had won from Salipur in 1977, 1990, 2000 and 2004.

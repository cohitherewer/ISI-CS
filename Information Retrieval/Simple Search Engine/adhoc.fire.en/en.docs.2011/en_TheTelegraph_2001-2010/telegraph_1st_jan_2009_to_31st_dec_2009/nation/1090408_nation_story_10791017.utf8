The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Front seat, though not on assignment 
                                                                                                               Front seat, though not on assignment 
          RASHEED KIDWAI AND GAJINDER SINGH                              
	New Delhi, April 7: Jarnail Singh was not assigned to cover the media conference of P. Chidambaram this morning but the Dainik Jagran defence correspondent arrived well in advance to occupy the front seat facing the home minister.        
	For almost half an hour, he spoke little or shared anything with two persons who were sitting on his right and left.        
	My action was not pre-planned. What I did I feel now was not right. Chidambaram was happy at Tytler being given a clean chit but he had nothing to say about the victims of 1984. Whatever happened took place in the heat of the moment, Jarnail later told The Telegraph.        
	Dainik Jagran issued a statement promising disciplinary action against the journalist. It said Jarnails conduct was unbecoming of a journalist and against professional ethics.        
	Those who knew Jarnail said that that for past few days, he was upset. He was known to be an admirer of Manmohan Singh and also the home minister till he across remarks attributed to Chidambaram that the case against Jagdish Tytler was not strong.         
	The journalist is said to have veered round to the view that the CBIs move to provide a clean chit to Tytler was based on political considerations.        
	At his place of work, his colleagues said the young man was deeply religious and felt strongly about his faith.         
	By the evening, the Akali Dal announced Rs 2 lakh reward to Jarnail and offered a parliamentary ticket. Jarnail said he would not take up the offers although the prospects of his continuation as a correspondent now appear bleak.        
	Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal said the journalists action should serve as an eye opener for the Congress.         
	The incident portrays the depth and of pain over clean chits given to those guilty of the 1984 massacre of Sikhs by Congress goons.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT AND AGENCIES                          A train set on fire by protesters in Jalandhar. (AFP)                                  
	May 25: Followers of a Sikh religious sect went on the rampage in Punjab today, angered by the murder of a senior priest in Vienna.         
	The violence claimed two lives and prompted the state administration to call in the army.         
	Sant Ramanand, the second-in-command of the Jalandhar-based Dera Sach Khand sect, was shot yesterday in a gurdwara in Vienna. At least 16 others were wounded, among them six of the priests attackers and Sant Niranjan Dass, the 66-year-old chief of the sect.         
	Sant Ramanand died in hospital around midnight.        
	The Dera Sach Khand sect has a Dalit following. Witnesses to the shooting said the attackers were Sikhs from a higher caste who accused one or both the preachers of being disrespectful to their holy book.        
	Last night itself, curfew had been clamped in Jalandhar as authorities feared trouble would break out. But the prohibitory orders did not deter the protesters, who stoned buses, burnt a train and a police car. A wary Punjab government asked the army to send 33 columns of the force.         
	In the violence, one person was killed when army personnel opened fire in Lambra village near Jalandhar. The protesters had set a police superintendents car on fire, prompting security personnel to fire 20 rounds, the police said. The second person was killed in Jalandhar Cantonment station where the police opened fire on protesters.        
	Prohibitory orders were also issued in Ludhiana, Phagwara and Hoshiarpur.        
	In Jalandhar, bogies of the Jammu Kanyakumari Himsagar Express were set ablaze after passengers were forced out by the arsonists. The engine of the Sonepur-Jammu Express was set on fire by another band of protesters who forced the driver to get off by pointing a sword to his head.         
	Shops and commercial establishments downed shutters following a Punjab bandh called by the sect.         
	The Delhi-Lahore bus service was stopped at Ludhiana as a precaution.         
	In Vienna, the police said the attack on the 57-year-old priest was planned.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said he was deeply distressed by the attack and the subsequent violence. Whatever the provocation, it is important to maintain peace and harmony, he said.         
	Austrian foreign minister Michael Spindelegger called up foreign minister S.M. Krishna and said his government would make all efforts to bring the attackers to justice.

	Bhubaneswar, June 25: Maoists blasted a railway station and three mobile towers at two places in the rebel-hit district of Koraput, hours before the scheduled visit of Union home minister P. Chidambaram to the state.        
	The rebels blew up parts of the Kakiriguma railway station between Baiguda and Laxmipur stations of Rayagada-Koraput section around 1.30pm. Six armed men swooped on the station and forced two railway staff on duty to move out of the building before using detonators to blow it up.        
	They forcibly removed A.K. Prusty, the station manager on duty, and Surya Narayana, another railway staffer on duty, some 500m from the station and then blew up the station building, said East Coast Railway spokesperson M.D. Sahu.        
	The blast left two battery rooms, a panel board and a relay room of the station severely damaged. Communication to the station from the railway control room was completely snapped.        
	Following the blast, the Bhubaneswar-Koraput Hirakhand Express, which was stopped at Rayagada, had to be rescheduled. The train will now run as Koraput-Bhubaneswar Hirakhand Express at 10.45pm from Rayagada to Bhubaneswar.         
	Similarly, Koraput-Howrah Samaleswari Express, scheduled to leave Koraput today, was cancelled between Koraput and Titlagarh. Howrah-Koraput Samaleswari Express was stalled at Titlagarh and will return as Koraput-Howrah Samaleswari Express from Titlagarh to Howrah.         
	Rayagada-Koraput Passenger has been cancelled today, while Koraput- Rayagada Passenger has been stalled at Baliguda to return as a passenger special to Koraput.        
	Visakhapatnam Koraput passenger has been short-terminated at Rayagada and will return as Koraput-Visakhapatnam passenger from Rayagada to Visakhapatnam.        
	Railway officials have already begun efforts to restore normality of train services, which will begin after state police give its clearance.         
	Rebels also ransacked the Narayanpatna block office yesterday midnight and looted the office. Hundreds of Maoists, including women, went on a rampage in the block office and damaged computers and documents. The mayhem continued till 12.30am. The rebels then decamped with office bicycles and grain stored for midday meals.         
	On their way, rebels torched control rooms of two mobile towers and damaged a signal panel board near the village. The control rooms and the signal panel board were damaged, said deputy inspector-general of police Sanjeeb Panda.         
	At least 125 villages have remained cut off from the rest of the state since June 16 after Maoists felled more than 30 trees on three roads that connect the region to the district headquarters of Koraput.        
	The government has been airlifting food and essential commodities for the 100 Central Reserve Police Force and 60 Orissa State Armed Police personnel stationed at Narayanpatna, along with local policemen, owing to the blockade. Helicopters have been carrying rice, lentils, sugar, kerosene and dry food.

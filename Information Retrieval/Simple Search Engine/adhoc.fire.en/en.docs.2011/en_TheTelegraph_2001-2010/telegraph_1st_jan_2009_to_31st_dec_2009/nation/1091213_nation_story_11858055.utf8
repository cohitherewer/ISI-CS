          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Dec. 12: Praveen Mahajan, convicted of killing political stalwart brother Pramod, suffered brain haemorrhage late last night and slipped into a deep coma today, when he was to have returned to jail after a fortnights parole.        
	Praveen, 50, has been put on life support at the multi-speciality Jupiter Hospital in Thane, where doctors described his condition as severely critical.        
	Praveen, serving a life term for the murder of Pramod, complained of severe headache and dizziness before losing consciousness late on Friday at his Thane home.        
	His blood pressure was unbelievably high. That led to a pontine (brain) haemorrhage, said a doctor. He is on ventilator and cannot move or communicate because of complete paralysis of nearly all voluntary muscles.        
	Asked about the possibility of foul play, another doctor said: That is ruled out as there is no external injury.        
	Praveen, who was granted parole on medical grounds on November 27, had given several television interviews. He was being seen by many as having taken undue advantage of the ill-health provision. The police had opposed his parole, saying he might try to jump it, said Rakesh Maria, crime branch chief.

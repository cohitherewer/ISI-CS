The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Demolition Kalyan now an outcast
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Demolition Kalyan now an outcast
          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                          Kalyan Singh                                  
	Lucknow, Dec. 6: Seventeen years ago this day, he had been the key player in all the action while feigning inactivity and innocence.        
	Today, on the 17th anniversary of the Babri Masjid demolition, Kalyan Singh was languishing in political wilderness while desperately pretending he could still revive temple politics in Ayodhya.        
	The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister  dumped by the Samajwadi Party, indicted by the Liberhan Commission and till now cold-shouldered by the BJP which he wants to rejoin  spoke of floating a new party to try and build a Ram temple in Ayodhya.        
	I will accomplish my mission on Ayodhya by launching another vigorous temple movement. If the BJP doesnt take me back, I will have my own party to do it soon, he told reporters.        
	The scale of his isolation is underlined by the way one-time protg Kusum Rai, now a BJP Rajya Sabha member, has avoided visiting Kalyan even once since the Samajwadis disowned him last month.        
	Kalyans proximity to Kusum had hurt his image as a chief minister and even last year, Kalyan had been instrumental in getting her the Rajya Sabha nomination in the face of opposition from many BJP leaders.        
	When contacted today, Kusum refused to comment on Kalyan.        
	Officially, the BJP hasnt shut the door on the man who was chief minister when the mosque was pulled down. It may take a combined policy decision on him, Uma Bharti and Govindacharya, all of whom want to return to the party.        
	Kalyan, however, has powerful adversaries in the party, such as Rajnath Singh, Kalraj Mishra and Lalji Tandon. Besides, many in the BJP are unhappy about the apology he had issued for the Babri demolition after tying up with Mulayam Singh Yadav in January 2009.        
	Now, his talk of building a Ram temple at Ayodhya sounds farcical, a BJP leader said.        
	That puts Kalyan in a bind, because even if he forms a party, the Liberhan indictment means he cannot expect support from any outfit outside the Sangh parivar.        
	The commission has found him and his handpicked bureaucrats guilty of denuding the state of every legal, moral and statutory restraints and wilfully enabling and facilitating the wanton destruction and the ensuing anarchy.        
	Sources, however, said the BJP may not want to let Kalyans sizeable Lodh support slip away and may therefore offer membership to his son Rajveer, who is now an unattached MLA after quitting the Samajwadi Party. If that happens, and Rajveer accepts the offer, Kalyan may find it difficult to float his own party.        
	Kalyan put up a brave face today, saying his supporters wanted him to form an independent political outfit with Hindutva as its chief agenda.        
	He took up BJP leader Vinay Katiyars challenge to visit Ayodhya and do penance for his apology over the demolition. I will surely visit Ayodhya. Once I get the new party registered with the Election Commission, I will visit Ayodhya to reiterate my commitment to the construction of a grand temple at the site, Kalyan said.        
	But a sense of despondency came through as he regretted having quit the BJP twice. I have committed several mistakes in my life, but I believe in learning from my mistakes, he said.        
	Kalyan left the BJP in December 1999 and formed the Rashtriya Kranti Party (RKP), which he merged with the BJP in 2003 and was welcomed back warmly. But feeling sidelined by the middle of 2008, he quit the party again last January.

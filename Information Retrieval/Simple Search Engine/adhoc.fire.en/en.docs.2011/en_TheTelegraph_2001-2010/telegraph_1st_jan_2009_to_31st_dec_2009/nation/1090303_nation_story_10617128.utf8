The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lalu wary of Bengal fury
                                                                                                               Lalu wary of Bengal fury
          GAUTAM SARKAR                              
	Bhagalpur, March 2: Lalu Prasads railway bonanza for Bihar, especially the Bhagalpur division to be carved out of Malda, has sparked tension in the UPA camp, especially in Bengal.        
	Congress and its ally, Trinamul, have threatened to launch protests against the railway minister for his step-motherly attitude towards Bengal, while the states ruling Left government has castigated Lalu for his attitude.        
	Resentment has been brewing in Bengals political lobby over the proposed downsizing of eastern railways Malda division. Lalu Prasad, too, seems to be aware of the tension. Though he laid the foundation stone for the new Bhagalpur division yesterday, he refrained from announcing details  areas under the new division, its working capacity and jurisdiction limit.         
	On the same day, the minister laid the foundation for another division at Thabay in Gopalganj where he furnished every detail and also released a booklet.        
	For now the railway has appointed an officer on special duty Kushiram at the new division and an office has been set up on the Bhagalpur station premises. Kushiram, along with general manager of the eastern division Dipak Krishna, who visited Bhagalpur station recently, has evaded questions related to the development, so far.        
	By announcing the new division Lalu Prasad has managed to carve a niche in an NDA bastion.        
	On the other hand, in Bengal, Congress and Trinamul workers have begun agitation against the downsizing of the Malda division. On the day when the interim railway budget was passed, workers of both parties blocked trains and threatened to disallow trains from Bihar to Bengal.        
	In the eighties, the then railway minister and Congress MP from Malda, A.B.A. Gani Khan Choudhury, created the Malda division and shifted railways control from Sahebganj (Jharkhand) to Malda. At that time, like Lalu, Gani Khan Choudhury had to face severe criticism.

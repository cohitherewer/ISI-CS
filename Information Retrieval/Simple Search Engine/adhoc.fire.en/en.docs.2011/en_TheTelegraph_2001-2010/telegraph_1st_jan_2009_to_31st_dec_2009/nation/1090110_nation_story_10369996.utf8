The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mumbai lessons for NY cops
                                                                                                               Mumbai lessons for NY cops
                            
	Washington, Jan. 9 (Agencies): New York police have begun training officers in heavy weapons to help its elite security force fight off a commando-style attack like the Mumbai siege, commissioner Ray Kelly has told Congress.        
	Kelly and federal officials told a Senate homeland security committee hearing that the huge publicity and paralysing impact of the attacks, which killed over 170 people over three days, could inspire al Qaida and other militant groups to try such tactics in the US.        
	Charles Allen, the homeland security departments under secretary for intelligence, said: Response to a similar terrorist attack in a major US city would be difficult.        
	Kelly said New York and Mumbai shared attractions and vulnerabilities: two densely populated financial and media centres that are also major ports.         
	New Yorks Emergency Service Unit, an elite force, might become stretched too thin in a prolonged siege, Kelly said.         
	If the attacks continued over many hours, we would need to relieve our special units with rested officers.        
	He said the department was now giving all its recruits basic training in heavy weapons.         
	 Part of the reason the gunmen were able to inflict severe casualties in Mumbai was that, for the most part, the local police did not engage them, he added. Their weapons were not sufficiently powerful and they were not trained for that type of conflict.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chennai, Nov. 5: A newborn dumped by his middle-aged father desperate to hide the fact that hed sired a child at this late age survived a night of rain and slush to be found without a scratch.        
	M. Nagoormeeran, a 45-year-old farmer in Thiruvarur district, had thrown away the baby along an irrigation canal fearing ridicule from friends and relatives as he was already a grandfather with three daughters and a son. His eldest daughter, who is 18, is married and has a kid.        
	Nagoormeerans wife Rani, 37, had delivered the baby boy at their home in Manjakollai village, around 350km from Chennai, last night.         
	Today, Nagoormeeran initially tried to mislead the police saying he had buried the stillborn baby. But he confessed after further grilling.         
	Since I am already a grandfather, I did not want to be ridiculed by friends and relatives that I had fathered a baby at this stage in my life, he told the police.         
	The cops were stunned to find the newborn without a scratch. We had heavy rains last night and it is only because of Gods grace that the baby is alive, said inspector P. Rajasekar.

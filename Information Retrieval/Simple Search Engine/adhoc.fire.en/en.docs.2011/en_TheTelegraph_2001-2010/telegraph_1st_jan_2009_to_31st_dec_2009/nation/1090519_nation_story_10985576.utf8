                                                                                                               Film reward for generous soul
          PRIYA ABRAHAM                          Swapna Pati: Model way to social work                                  
	Bhubaneswar, May 18: Swapna Pati is a PYT with a fetish for fashion, junk food, romantic novels and long chats.         
	But, there is a more humanitarian side to the young woman thats reserved for inmates at Ashraya, an orphanage at Dumduma, for residents at a Patia Kanyasharam and for senior citizens at Naharkanta Vridhashram.        
	Swapna, 21, who travelled to Bhubaneswar to make a career in biotechnology three years ago, was drawn towards social work after meeting a few street children and orphans.         
	It all began three years ago. Swapna would spend a lot of time with our inmates and would contribute whatever possible to help us. She even started collecting funds from her family, friends, relatives and acquaintances and sent in that amount as donations, said an official at Ashraya.        
	After a while that fund dried up and people started to make up excuses to not pay. That was when I decided to opt for an alternative, Swapna said. As I was yet to complete my studies, it was difficult for me to find a full time job. Therefore, I gave modelling a shot, she said.         
	Soon, the girl was flooded with advertisement offers. The money I earned was for the homes. I would either buy utility items such as ceiling fans or gas ovens, or hand over the money, said she.        
	One such assignment got her to Calcutta, where she caught the eye of an NRI director Imroz Hussain who offered her a role in his film.         
	Its an English film about a village girl who struggles to carve out a niche for herself in theatre. She succeeds professionally, but in the process makes a few personal sacrifices, said Swapna. I am excited about the project and love the script, she said.         
	What is truly impressive about this beauty with brains is her heart  she plans to donate the entire sum that she would earn from the film to the orphanages.         
	Besides the Indo-European venture, Swapna has also been offered a Telegu and a Bengali movie. However, acting will be for that extra cash, while I seriously wish to pursue a career in bio-technology, said the young woman with determination.

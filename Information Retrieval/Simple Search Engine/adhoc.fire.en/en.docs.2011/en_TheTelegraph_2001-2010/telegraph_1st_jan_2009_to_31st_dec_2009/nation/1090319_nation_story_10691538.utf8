	Lucknow, March 18: Varun Gandhis alleged public outburst against Muslims and his defence of being a proud Hindu has its roots in the redrawing of the constituency map which has altered the voter profile of Pilibhit.         
	Sources said Varun, who has inherited the constituency from mother Maneka Gandhi, a five-time winner, got the jitters after the delimitation exercise took away a sizeable chunk of Hindu voters.         
	Varuns worries began when the Hindu-dominated Assembly segment of Puwain, which was part of Pilibhit and voted vigorously for Maneka, had to go with Shahjehanpur parliamentary constituency following delimitation.         
	In its place, Bahedi Assembly segment from Bareilly, which has a majority of Muslim voters, got tagged with Pilibhit.         
	Bahedi has over one lakh Muslim voters, which has swelled the communitys numbers in Pilibhit, a district bordering Nepal. The constituency now has a little over 2.5 lakh Muslim voters among the total electorate of around 13 lakh.         
	This change in voter profile of the constituency has caused a sense of insecurity in Varun. He was in close touch with some workers of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and BJP to work out strategy. He thought of polarising the Hindu and Sikh voters in his favour, said a senior BJP leader in Pilibhit.        
	Sources pointed out that Maneka, in spite of winning five terms  Indias only lady MP to win as many elections from the same constituency  seldom played an overt-Hindutva card, though she banked on the Hindu and Sikh votes. Sikhs comprise around 9.3 per cent of the electorate.         
	Adding to his fears, the Congress has again fielded Virendra Mohan Singh, a former personal secretary to Maneka. Known as VM, Singh, a Sikh, has been a strong farmer leader in the region and has taken up their cause at various forums. On a series of land dispute issues, he had petitioned Allahabad High Court and ensured justice for Sikh and Hindu farmers.        
	In 2004, Singh fell out with Maneka and joined the Congress. He contested against his former boss from Pilibhit and bagged 1,06,186 votes, considerably narrowing Manekas margin of victory.         
	Maneka has been contesting from Pilibhit since 1989 and except in 1991, when she lost by a small margin, she has won with massive numbers, garnering between 55-60 per cent of the votes. It was only in 2004 that her share of votes came down to around 38 per cent  though she won the seat by a margin of over a lakh  because of the division in Sikh votes caused by Singh.                     Maneka: Son trouble      
	Singhs clout coupled with the addition of Muslim voters who are likely to support the Samajwadi Party is what got the young Gandhi, fighting his first election at 29, worried.         
	During his recent visits, sources said, Varun discussed the issue with his election management team and decided to launch a tirade against the Samajwadi candidate, Riaz Ahmed, a four-time MLA from Pilibhit. Without naming him, Varuns speech allegedly bracketed him with Islamic terror.        
	Sources said the young BJP leaders defence in Delhi today, citing attacks on Hindus in the constituency after the 2007 Assembly polls and demolition of three temples in Pilibhit, was weak. Local sources claimed the only temple that was destroyed in the jungles of Maho in Pilibhit was back in 2004. Maneka, they said, knew about the incident but chose not to make it an issue.        
	Also, the local sources said, Varuns alleged promise to chop off the hands of communal forces was apparently provoked by the rape of two girls in Barkheda area of Pilibhit in the third week of February this year. The rape was unnecessarily given a communal twist by the BJP, said a resident.

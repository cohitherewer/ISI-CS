										      SUJAN DUTTA                                                 
	New Delhi, March 19: In the excellently appointed chamber of the defence minister in South Block with a sweeping view of the Boat Club lawns right up to India Gate, Pranab Mukherjee had to spare a thought for the gutters of Jangipur when he stepped in as defence minister right after his first victory in a Lok Sabha election in 2004.         
	On his first day in office  May 22, 2004  among those in the high-ceilinged room was Adhir Chowdhury, the Congress strongman who helped him win.         
	Dada, Chowdhury exclaimed to Mukherjee in that twang that cuts between the colloquial and the formal. You are now the military affairs minister, he marvelled, chewing a mishmash of betel and tobacco.         
	Clearly, there was more coming from the MP of Behrampore.         
	Just imagine, Chowdhury was coming up with the punch line, just how much arms and munitions will be at your command!         
	Mukherjee smiled a wan smile.         
	For months, there used to be a collection of small-time politicians from Jangipur, Mukherjees constituency, and other towns of Bengal with whom the defence minister of India had to hold discussions on the problems of winning panchayat and civic polls  and hence the talks on improving the gutters of Jangipur.         
	Then he decided to take the bull by the horns and despite the support of the Left with gnashing teeth to the UPA government, Mukherjee visited the US and quietly signed the 10-year New Framework Agreement for the India-US Defence Cooperation.         
	Nobody knew before his visit that that life-changing agreement for India-US diplomacy was on the cards. In one stroke, Mukherjee had severed the traditional pro-Russian tilt in military ties and effected a fine pirouette Pentagon-wards. The demand to scrap that agreement is in the Lefts manifesto in this poll.         
	 When Mukherjee left for the external affairs ministry, with the civilian nuclear deal just about signed, the Left at its angriest and the defence portfolio a hot potato, Arackaparambil Kurian Antony was given the hot potato on October 24, 2006.         
	In just about a year he fainted.         
	The man reputed to be among the cleanest of politicians in the country, often called Saint Antony in the Kerala media, quickly earned the epithet Faint Antony among journalists. Defence ministry bureaucrats telephoned by journalists took the joke smartly.         
	In usual courtesies on telephone calls before being asked the news, they responded to the question how are you by replying havent fainted yet.         
	Army officers, of course, recalled the pun of the passing-out parade after Antonys indisposition on May 31, 2008, at the National Defence Academy, Khadakvasala, near Pune.         
	Grossly unfair to the minister who is so modest in his mien and mannerism that his sincere humility would put even clerks in his ministry to shame. Antony treats personnel below officer rank  as jawans are officially classified  with utmost respect. They feel humbled. In the rigid hierarchy of the armed forces, such humility is rare. Unlike George Fernandes, he did not need to fly in the MiG 21 or spend a night undersea in a submarine to earn respect.         
	But his humility does not absolve Antony of his faults.         
	The symbolism of the defence minister fainting in public is too much for a nation repeatedly hit by terrorist strikes. Doctors said it was out of exhaustion. But it was his responsibility to have rested adequately for that mornings programmes.         
	Antony has shown mettle elsewhere, though. He has claimed credit for actualising indigenous products  the main battle tank Arjun, which the army is now ready to induct, and the light combat aircraft Tejas that flew for the first time last month at Aero India like the fighter aircraft it is meant to be. Both projects are delayed by at least a decade but they are both homegrown and have come to look like fighting machines in Antonys tenure.         
	He has also shaped a defence procurement policy that will streamline acquisitions.        
	But he has delayed taking decisions on big-ticket acquisitions. The controversy over the pricing of the Admiral Gorshkov aircraft carrier that India has contracted is unresolved; the process of buying 126 medium multi-role combat aircraft is delayed; as is the process for acquiring about 300 helicopters and heavy artillery.        
	Antony has also allowed backdoor entries for US watchdog policies on imports of American military equipment. He has done little that is right, not much that is wrong but has put into place policies that will take much longer to fructify.

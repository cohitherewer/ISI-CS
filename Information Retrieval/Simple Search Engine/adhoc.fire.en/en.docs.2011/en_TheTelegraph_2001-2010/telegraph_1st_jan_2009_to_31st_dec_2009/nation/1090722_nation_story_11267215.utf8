The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Modi minority play gets Junagadh jolt 
                                                                                                               Modi minority play gets Junagadh jolt 
          BASANT RAWAT                               
	Ahmedabad, July 21: Narendra Modi today received a blow with the BJP losing the Junagadh municipal corporation elections that the Gujarat chief minister had turned into a referendum of his attempt at projecting a liberal face.        
	This is the first time the BJP has lost control of the municipality, a result that could raise questions about Modi trying to shed his aggressive Hindutva stance and reaching out to Muslims.         
	Modi had fielded five Muslim candidates. All of themlost their deposits. The chief minister also got senior leaders such as Bhavna Chikhaliya, a five-time MP from Junagadh and former central minister, to contest.         
	Chikhaliya won but will have to remain content being a councillor.        
	The Junagadh Mahanagar Palika has 51 seats, of which the Congress bagged 26, 10 more than what it had last time. The BJP managed only 21, down from its previous tally of 35 seats. Three candidates of the BSP and one Independent nominee also got elected.         
	The Congress had fielded seven Muslim candidates, of whom six won. The only Muslim candidate who lost was defeated by a rebel Congress face from the minority community who contested as a BSP nominee.        
	It is a clear signal that Hindus have rejected Modis affair with the minority community. Muslims remain steadfastly loyal to the Congress, said a BJP source.         
	So focused was Modi on the civic polls that he got almost his entire council of ministers and some 60 MLAs to campaign in Junagadh.         
	A senior BJP functionary said the Junagadh defeat would be the biggest setback for Modi in his tenure of eight years as chief minister.        
	The defeat could turn out to be a major headache for Modi as he has ignored the discontent among grassroots workers and party cadre who are not happy with the way the chief minister refuses to share power. Their discontent might erupt in any form, he said.        
	BJP spokesperson Vijay Rupani, while accepting the mandate, said: The people of Junagadh have rejected us but we will continue to serve them and introspect why we lost.

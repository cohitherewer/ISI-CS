The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP spares Jaswant
                                                                                                               BJP spares Jaswant
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Jaswant                                  
	New Delhi, June 12: The BJP has ruled out acting against Jaswant Singh for his oblique criticism of L.K. Advani and Arun Jaitley over the election defeat.        
	On Wednesday, Jaswant had appeared to question the installation of Advani and Jaitley as the leaders of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, and called for parity between inam (reward) and parinaam (result). He had demanded that responsibility be fixed on those who managed the polls.        
	Advani was the BJPs candidate for Prime Minister and the focus of a shrill, personality-oriented campaign, while Jaitley was the principal poll strategist.        
	Speculation that Jaswant could be in trouble began when party president Rajnath Singh met Advani this morning. Hours later, spokesman Rajiv Pratap Rudy denied any punishment was in the offing.        
	Since there is no proposal that action should be taken against Jaswant Singh, there is no question of taking action, he said.        
	Rudy maintained that Jaswants words, penned in a letter circulated at a core committee meeting, were not accusations against party leaders and therefore did not amount to a misdemeanour.        
	Jaswant had written of a growing tendency among BJP leaders to become too self-centred to serve the public cause. He had quoted a couplet by Tulsidas that said those who preached to the world but could not live up to their ideals counted for little in public life.        
	The letter also said that before the BJP had introspected on its performance, its ideologues were analysing the causes of the defeat in the media. It alluded indirectly to a magazine article by Sudheendra Kulkarni, Advanis key political aide, that put some of the blame on the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh for not backing his boss fully.        
	Rudy ticked off Kulkarni but added that the question of acting against him did not arise because he was not a party member.        
	Kulkarni, however, told The Telegraph: I am a member of the BJP but not an office-bearer.        
	A senior Advani aide pleaded ignorance: I am not sure if he is a member or not.        
	However, this aide and Rudy admitted that Kulkarni had been a member of the election strategy committee and was closely associated with the Advani for Prime Minister project.        
	Kulkarni was part of the campaign strategy committee and suddenly decided to write (the article) as an independent journalist. His contentions are unacceptable because before casting aspersions on others, he should blame himself, Rudy said.        
	Sources said that after the Jinnah controversy in 2005, Advani had dropped Kulkarni from the BJP national executive to buy peace with party and Sangh. In less than a year, Kulkarni had wormed his way back into the BJP leaders charmed circle and regained his position as one of Advanis principal political advisers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CPM blames state factors
                                                                                                               CPM blames state factors
          JAYANTH JACOB                              
	New Delhi, June 19: The CPM central leadership today pointed a finger at state factors for the partys poll debacle in Bengal and Kerala as the politburo met ahead of the two-day central committee meeting starting tomorrow.        
	The meeting has been convened primarily to analyse the partys worst performance in the Lok Sabha elections.        
	Despite criticism of the decision to forge a third front, identified by many quarters in Bengal as the pivotal reason for the debacle, the central leadership stressed that the Left parties and the CPM have to be a rallying force behind such an alternative.         
	It admitted lacunae in cobbling such a coalition in haste but analysed election results in detail, going down to the percentage of votes polled even in Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra, to argue that the space for a non-BJP, non-Congress policy platform still existed, sources said.         
	In the report on the election setback placed before the politburo today, the leadership said organisational factors as well as policy decisions being misused by the Opposition contributed to the worse-than-expected setback in Bengal.         
	A source said the central leadership felt there was a disconnect between the state leadership and the local leadership, and between the local leadership and the masses, that contributed to the huge defeat. It also called for a rectification campaign.         
	Because of the disconnect the party couldnt gauge the mood of the people, like it used to, and this led to the extent of defeat being totally unexpected, the sources added.         
	Confusion over land acquisition continues to haunt the party and the Bengal government, the leadership added.        
	In Kerala, the party now admits its poll pact with the PDP of Abdul Nasar Madani alienated a section of Muslims. CPM state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan played the key role in deciding the tie-up.         
	The state party unit alienated the Christian community and there is a need to reach out to them, the leadership said.         
	The SNC Lavalin corruption case against Vijayan was also mentioned, with the report saying confusion on the issue contributed to the defeat.

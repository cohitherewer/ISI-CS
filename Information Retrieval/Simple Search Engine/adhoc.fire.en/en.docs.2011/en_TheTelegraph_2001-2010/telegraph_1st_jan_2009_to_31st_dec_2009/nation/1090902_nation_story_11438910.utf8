          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 1: An analysis of pandemic H1N1 flu fatalities in India has shown that more than half of the patients who died were between the age of 26 and 45, a pattern comparable to the deaths in the US.        
	The Indian Council of Medical Research has written to four international vaccine makers indicating the country would like to conduct clinical trials of candidate vaccines against the pandemic H1N1 virus, a senior health official said.         
	The pandemic flu analysis, released today, of 82 deaths in August in different states has shown that 42 patients (51 per cent) belonged to this age group, while 18 patients (22 per cent) were between 46 and 64 years.         
	The distribution of H1N1 fatalities is similar to the pattern in the US where an analysis of 268 deaths by the centres of disease control (CDC) has indicated that the proportion of deaths is highest among people between 25 and 49 years.         
	The analysis by the National Institute of Communicable Diseases, New Delhi, has also shown that 36 out of the 82 patients had underlying diseases  17 had diabetes, 11 had heart disease, 8 had lung disease.         
	Almost all who died had received the antiviral oseltamivir five days after onset of symptoms and a large number of patients had been to two private clinics before turning to designated hospitals, said Shiv Lal, director general of the National Institute of Communicable Disease.         
	These results allow us to repeat what weve been telling people  patients at high risk of severe disease or those with symptoms of severe illness should go to the designated facilities early, Lal said.         
	The clinical trials of candidate vaccines would be aimed at establishing their safety and ability to trigger an immune response against the flu virus in the Indian population, Vishwa Mohan Katoch, director-general of the ICMR, said.         
	Weve heard from GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis. They appear willing to consider trials in India. If the trials are approved, we expect them to begin sometime in October or November, Katoch said.

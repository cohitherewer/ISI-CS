                                                                                                               BJP barbs for betrayer
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, March 27: Former Union minister Dillip Ray and former NCP state president Bijoy Mohapatra, who formally joined the BJP here today, appealed to the people to teach betrayer Naveen Patnaik a lesson in the coming elections him.         
	Addressing a rally at the state BJP headquarters, Ray said the decision of forging an anti-Congress alliance in Orissa was taken in the presence of legendary leader Biju Patnaik at his (Rays) residence in New Delhi. The idea took shape soon after his death.         
	I was very close to Biju Babu and he used to stay at my residence till his death. Bijoy Mohapatra and myself had played a crucial role in the formation of BJD and its alliance with BJP. But we were stabbed in the back by none other than the great leaders son, Naveen, whom we had made our party president, alleged Ray.         
	Describing Naveen as a two-headed snake, he said such a person should be taught a lesson.         
	Mohapatra, regarded as the prime opponent of the BJD chief, alleged that Naveen was just a puppet in the hands of bureaucrat-turned-politician Pyari Mohan Mohapatra and was driving the state to the brink of disaster.         
	Welcoming the duo, BJP national vice-president and former Union minister Juel Oram said that he had broached the idea of forging an anti-Congress alliance in Orissa before the then Janata Dal leader, Biju Patnaik. The idea was strongly supported by Mohapatra. Naveen had betrayed party colleagues Mohapatra and Ray first. Now, he completed the circle by breaking the 11-year alliance, said Oram, describing Naveen as a betrayer and serial killer.

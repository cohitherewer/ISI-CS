The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Multiple-choice test plan on CBSE table 
                                                                                                               Multiple-choice test plan on CBSE table 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 4: The Central Board of Secondary Education is planning to make its optional examination for Class X students completely multiple-choice in a move that could end subjective marking even in history and languages.         
	Students will face multiple-choice questions of three difficulty levels in the optional Class X test under an examination pattern the CBSE is proposing, top government officials said.         
	Officials in both the CBSE and the human resource development ministry emphasised that the exact pattern under their consideration had not yet been finalised, and may need tweaks before implementation.         
	But ministry sources confirmed they were working towards making the optional examination multiple-choice based. They also said the Class X board examination was likely to become optional only by 2011  at the earliest.         
	At present, the qualifying public examination at the end of Class X is mandatory for all students at CBSE schools  Indias largest school board.         
	Apart from an internal assessment section, and practicals in the sciences and math, the main examination at present is completely subjective  or long-answer style, as the pattern is popularly referred to.         
	The board has issued a directive to all affiliated schools to prepare a bank of 500 multiple-choice questions in each of the subjects.         
	The board has over 10,000 affiliated schools; so the move will help the CBSE create a bank of over 5 million questions in each subject, without including repetitions.         
	The science questions must include equal representation of physics, chemistry and biology while the social sciences bank must do justice to history, geography and civics.         
	The questions in each subject are to be divided into three segments  very easy, average and higher order thinking skills (HOTS).         
	The multiple-choice questions are all required to have only one correct answer.         
	Such a shift to a multiple-choice based examination will end all subjectivity in marking that invariably leads to controversies each year, a ministry source said.         
	Officials, however, admitted that the move would be relatively easier in the sciences, math, geography or civics as compared to history or languages like English, Hindi or Sanskrit.         
	Under the HRD ministrys plan to make the board examination optional, students will be graded according to a CBSE-prescribed common grading system in Class X.

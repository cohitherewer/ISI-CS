The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Singers daughter commits suicide
                                                                                                               Singers daughter commits suicide
          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                              
	Mumbai, May 29: Tragedy has struck ghazal artiste Chitra Singh again with her daughter hanging herself last night, 19 years after the death of her son had caused the singer to retire prematurely.        
	Police said Monica Chowdhary, 50, Chitras daughter from her first marriage, hanged herself from a ceiling fan at her Bandra home, unable to cope with the failure of her marriage.        
	Chitra and her second husband Jagjit Singh, the ghazal maestro, are believed to be abroad. Jagjit still performs but Chitra quit singing soon after their son Vivek died in a road accident in July 1990.        
	Although Chitra had divorced her first husband four decades ago, she had kept in touch with Monica and was a regular visitor to her sixth-floor flat in Perry Cross Road.        
	Police sources said Monica had married a Bollywood cinematographer, Jehangir Chowdhary, and had two sons  Arman, 18, and Umed, 12. In 2005, she divorced Chowdhary and married a Briton, Mark Atkins, who was then working with an MNC in Mumbai. In 2007, she filed a police complaint against Atkins alleging mental and physical torture.        
	Atkins fled the country. A red-corner notice was issued through Interpol, an officer said.        
	Monica went into severe depression. No suicide note was found, but prima facie it appears to be suicide.

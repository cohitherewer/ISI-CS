                                                                                                               Case against cops in MBA death 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Aug. 5: The Central Bureau of Investigation has filed an FIR against several Uttarakhand police officers, a month after a management graduate was shot dead in an alleged encounter hours before a visit by the President.        
	In a preliminary report to a court, the agency said a prima facie case existed against the officers and investigators hadnt found any evidence that could support the police claim that Ranbir Singh pulled a gun on them during a vehicle check.        
	The alleged July 3 encounter in Dehra Dun had triggered an uproar and the 24-year-old MBAs mother said the cops had shot her son just to earn brownie points ahead of President Pratibha Patils visit to the hill state.        
	An autopsy report had revealed that Ranbirs body had 24 injury marks, including 10 bullet marks, a couple of them in the head.        
	Sources in the CBI said a special investigation team led by SP Nilabh Kishore had on August 1 and 2 searched the so-called encounter spot in a forest area.        
	A source said the six-member team found around a dozen used cartridges of automatic rifles in an area not more than 200-250sqm. This goes to show that the firing was done on the young MBA graduate from a very close range, the CBI said in its preliminary report to the chief judicial magistrates court in Dehra Dun.        
	The CBI team also found that no firing was done from the revolver of an inspector shown as snatched by Ranbir, the source said.         
	Dehra Dun police had claimed they had to fire at Ranbir  who family sources said was to take up a job of a trainee manager a few days later  as he was firing from a revolver snatched from an inspector on duty.         
	Besides this, no bullet shots of police were found in other areas of the jungle which also seemed to challenge the authenticity of the encounter, the report said.        
	The CBI, which began probing the alleged encounter on July 31, three weeks after Uttarakhand chief minister Ramesh Pokhriyal handed over the case to the agency on July 8, is learnt to have so far recorded statements of 18 people. A chargesheet will be filed within a month, a source said.        
	On July 5, Uttarakhand police had registered a case of murder against 14 policemen, all from Dehra Dun. The state government has already benched the 14.         
	The CBIs FIR makes the state police case irrelevant. It is, however, not clear if the CBI would retain this list of 14 or expand it. We will state that in our chargesheet, said a CBI officer.

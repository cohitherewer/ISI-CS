	Dec. 10: Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao held separate telephone conversations with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to discuss climate change.        
	The three leaders expressed willingness to enhance co-ordination and co-operation at the Copenhagen conference, Xinhua news agency said.         
	Indian official sources told The Telegraph the unexpected phone call from Wen lasted about 10 minutes.         
	A Sudanese diplomat representing the G77 group of developing countries pitched a challenge to Barack Obama, citing the Nobel Peace Prize he accepted less than two hours ago.         
	We ask the US to take on commitments comparable to (other) industrialised countries, said Lumumba Stanislaus Di-Aping, chair of the G77 group.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rabri under abuse glare
                                                                                                               Rabri under abuse glare
          OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES                          Rabri Devi                                  
	Patna, April 5: Rabri Devi came under the Election Commissions glare today for alleged calumny after charges that she made offensive remarks about Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar at a campaign rally.        
	Nitishs Janata Dal (United) complained to the poll panel along with footage of Rabris speech in Saran, where the former chief minister was campaigning for Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) president and husband Lalu Prasad. An FIR has also been lodged.        
	In its complaint, the Dal (U) demanded a campaign bar on Rabri and her expulsion as MLA. It has also threatened to sue her for alleged defamation.        
	Lallan Singh is the brother-in-law of Nitish ... and Nitish is the brother-in-law of Lallan. That is why both of them are always seen holding each others hands, Rabri is seen telling people in the footage.         
	Nitish and Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lallan Singh arent related, but the description of them being brother-in-laws has been made in an indecent manner, the Dal (United) said.        
	We have sent the CD to the state election office and the Election Commission for action for violation of the model code of conduct, a Dal (United) leader said.        
	An enraged Nitish, who swept Rabri out of power in 2005, declared he and his party would take recourse to law to rein such foul-mouthed campaigners. The JD-U and its ally (the BJP) would take the recourse of law to keep the abusive campaigners in check, Nitish said tonight.        
	Some said Rabri had always been a loose cannon. This isnt the first time that Rabri has spoken like this. She is yet to learn how to speak in proper political lingo, said Shivanand Tiwary, a Dal (United) general secretary who was once one of Lalu Prasads closest aides.        
	It is quite surprising that a leader like Rabri, who ruled Bihar for over seven-and-a-half years, is using such abusive words against opponents, Tiwary, who sent the complaint to the poll panel, said.        
	Panel censure        
	The Election Commission has disapproved of Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadavs remark against an Uttar Pradesh district magistrate and issued notices to home minister P. Chidambaram and BJP leader Jaswant Singh for alleged violation of the model code.        
	The panel told Mulayam to be more cautious and noted that his reply to its notice was not satisfactory.        
	Chidambaram was slapped the notice for allegedly offering sops during a visit to Rajasthan for a security review. The commission sought his reply by 5pm tomorrow.         
	BJP leader Jaswant Singh was issued a notice for allegedly distributing money during a public meeting in Rajasthans Barmer district.

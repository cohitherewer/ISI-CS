The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Superfast resignation overshadows mishap
                                                                                                               Superfast resignation overshadows mishap
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          The site of the Metro bridge collapse in Delhi. Picture by Prem Singh                                  
	New Delhi, July 12: When a tidal wave smashed parts of the Pamban bridge connecting Rameshwaram with mainland Tamil Nadu in 1963, a 31-year-old civil engineer from Kerala was given six months to repair it.        
	He did it in 46 days.        
	Thus began the legend of E. Sreedharan, the man who ate deadlines for breakfast, and the boss whose resignation today left his colleagues, from Metro official to ordinary worker, shocked and in tears.        
	However, hours after the Metro Man had accepted moral responsibility for the bridge collapse, the state government asked him to stay on.        
	Many believe, though, that the 77-year-old Delhi Metro chief knew all along that his resignation would be rejected  it was just a ploy to keep the media from asking uncomfortable questions.        
	After all, the whole state cabinet had begged him to stay on after he put in his papers in 2002 following a public spat with railway ministry officials.        
	And sure enough, his announcement stunned even the media at Metro Bhavan today, and the accident almost took back seat for a while.        
	Sreedharan was calm and composed as he walked in for the packed news conference, leaving a meeting where, for the past one hour, his colleagues had been trying to persuade him to change his mind.        
	Its my personal decision; please do not interfere, is what sources say were his last words before he walked out to address the media.        
	I have sent (my resignation) to Lt Governor Tejinder Khanna and Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit, the man who has headed the Delhi Metro since its birth in November 1997 told the reporters.        
	Junior officers wept openly. Its a shock for us. We never expected such a hard decision from him, an ordinary Metro worker was quoted by PTI. He was a very simple man and his decision has demoralised every worker.        
	Sreedharan told the reporters: If it had been the first instance, I wouldnt have taken this step. This is a repetition of the incident in October 2008 (a bridge collapse that killed two and injured 16). This is more serious and an even bigger jolt.        
	But a government source laughed the resignation off. It will not be accepted. Without him, the Metro project will never be complete. He is indispensable for the Delhi government.        
	Sreedharan told the news conference that no one was indispensable but accepted that his exit could hurt the Metro, which needs to complete a huge extension project before the October 2010 Commonwealth Games.        
	Perhaps, if I quit and the new man comes in  it may be a setback to the projects but my personal conviction about this cannot be compromised on, he said. He could not be contacted after Dikshit rejected his resignation.        
	Sreedharan, a classmate of former chief election commissioner T.N. Seshan, began his career as a lecturer in civil engineering at the Kerala Polytechnic in Kozhikode. He moved to Bombay Port Trust as an apprentice and later joined the railways as an engineer.        
	He was deputy chief engineer in charge of the implementation, planning and design of the Calcutta Metro in 1970, and was later chairman and managing director (CMD) of Cochin Shipyard. He retired in 1990 but the government appointed him CMD of Konkan Railway.        
	The Palakkad native was awarded the Padma Shri in 2001 and the Chevalier de la Legion dHonneur (Knight of the Legion of Honour) by France in 2005.        
	Flooded site        
	The accident site was flooded this morning, hampering salvage operations, as falling concrete burst a water pipe.        
	Thank God its a Sunday was the refrain in the Lajpat Nagar neighbourhood, where the bridge runs between the Lady Sriram College and Blue Bells School.        
	If this had happened on a weekday at, say, 8pm, the toll would have been far higher, said Ketaki Mehta, who takes the road below the bridge every day at 8am to reach her school. The road to her home, about 500 metres from the site, was blocked by concrete slabs and iron beams and rods.

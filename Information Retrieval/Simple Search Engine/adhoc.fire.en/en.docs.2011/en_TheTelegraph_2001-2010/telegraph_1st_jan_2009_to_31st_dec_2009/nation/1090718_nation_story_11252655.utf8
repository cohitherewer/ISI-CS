The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Snub amp; balm for Joshi
                                                                                                               Snub amp; balm for Joshi
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          Rahul Gandhi with supporters in Rae Bareli on Friday. (PTI)            
	Lucknow, July 17: Rahul Gandhi today distanced himself from the alleged derogatory remarks made by Uttar Pradesh Congress president Rita Bahuguna Joshi against Mayavati but launched a scathing attack on the chief minister by renewing his call for bijli-sadak-pani in the BSP-ruled state.        
	During a thanksgiving visit to Amethi which re-elected him to the Lok Sabha, Rahul described as unfortunate Joshis purported remark two days ago that when Mayavati gets raped, I will pay her Rs 1 crore.         
	The state Congress chief, who is said to have Rahuls ears, was speaking at a public rally in Moradabad where she was criticising the paltry compensation of Rs 25,000 paid to Dalit rape victims.         
	Rahul, however, signalled that the issue of compensation would continue to be a part of the Congresss campaign in the state. Her (Joshis) comments on Mayavati are unfortunate but they might have been prompted by her anger against the government, he said during a chat with reporters at the Sanjay Gandhi Guest House in Amethi. I can understand her anger in dealing with the government because for all practical purposes it is not operational.        
	Rahul, however, steered clear of the controversy during his public speeches.         
	Instead, he spoke on his pet theme of development  adequate electricity, good roads and sufficient water.        
	Crores of rupees released by the Centre for the development of Uttar Pradesh have been wasted by the state government. That is why no improvement took place all these years in the power sector or in strengthening civic amenities like roads and water supply, Rahul said.         
	He ridiculed Mayavatis obsession with statues. You know what all she (Mayavati) is busy doing, Rahul said. There is a place for statues and elephants but there is no space for development.        
	Mayavati upped the ante against Joshi, saying legal action would continue. She took a dig at Sonia Gandhi, saying though the Congress president had expressed pain and anguish over the remarks, her disapproval was more of a compulsion in the wake of the declining political graph of the Congress among the people, especially Dalits.         
	The bail hearing of Joshi, who is lodged in Moradabad jail, could not be taken up because of a strike by lawyers.

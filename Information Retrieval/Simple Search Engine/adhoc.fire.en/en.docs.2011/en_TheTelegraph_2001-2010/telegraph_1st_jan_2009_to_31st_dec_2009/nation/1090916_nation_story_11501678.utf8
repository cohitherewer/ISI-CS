The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cabinet had cleared land bill, says CP 
                                                                                                               Cabinet had cleared land bill, says CP 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          CP Joshi                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 15: Rural development minister C.P. Joshi today said the Union cabinet had approved the land acquisition bill despite opposition from Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee.        
	As far as the land acquisition bill is concerned, it has already been approved by the cabinet, Joshi said while presenting the quarterly report on his ministrys performance.        
	Now, the question when it will be introduced in Parliament has to be addressed by the parliamentary affairs ministry.        
	But Mamata, who had allegedly walked out of a cabinet meeting over certain provisions of the bill, questioned why it had not been placed before Parliament yet.        
	Why has it not been tabled in Parliament so far? Mamata, whose Trinamul has led protests against land acquisition in Bengal, said.         
	One of the provisions she had opposed was that private developers had to acquire 70 per cent of the land for a proposed industrial project directly from farmers and landowners. The remaining 30 per cent is to be acquired by the state government.        
	The railway minister also rejected allegations that her department was acquiring land by force. If there is a dispute we will not acquire land forcibly. If the people give their land, then we will purchase it, she said.        
	Joshi said his ministry wanted to catalyse development in backward areas by providing infrastructure and promoting agrarian reforms.         
	Asked about nominating Congress MPs to the apex body that oversees the implementation of the governments flagship rural employment guarantee (NREGA) scheme, Joshi said it was his prerogative as a minister. Ours is a political government and policies are always political, he said.        
	Welfare measures, he added, were executed on the basis of the strength of a party and hence it was natural to recommend politicians.        
	Joshi said his ministry had held workshops and extensive consultations to keep the focus on critical issues and priority areas highlighted by the President to strengthen the employment scheme.        
	Till July 2009, the minister added, 2.53 crore households have been provided work and 87.09 crore person-days generated. Joshi also pointed out that the average daily wage across the country had increased from Rs 75 to Rs 87 in the last three years.

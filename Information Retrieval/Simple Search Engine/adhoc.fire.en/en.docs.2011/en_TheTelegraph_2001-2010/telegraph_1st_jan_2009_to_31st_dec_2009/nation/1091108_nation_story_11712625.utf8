          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          The family of a slain farmer in Sambalpur. (A file picture)                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 7: Faced with an Opposition allegation of neglect leading to a spate of farmers suicide in the state, the government is now mulling provision of co-operative loans to share-croppers, who were earlier deprived of the facility since they owned no land.        
	Meanwhile, the number of farmers suicides has gone up to 18, due to alleged kharif crop failure after an erratic rainfall and pest attacks.         
	The Opposition parties have lambasted the Naveen Patnaik government for the suicides.        
	Even a BJP central team, once an ally of the ruling BJD, charged the government of murder when it recently visited the state for a survey.        
	Agriculture minister Damodar Rout told The Telegraph today that the proposal for providing co-operative credit to share-croppers was discussed at a meeting chaired by him to discuss the Five-year Perspective Plan for the agriculture sector, to be submitted to chief minister Naveen Patnaik.         
	The proposal will be placed before the chief minister for his final approval soon, he added. Provision of co-operative loans for share-croppers will help solve credit problems faced by them, hoped Rout.        
	Most farmers who took their lives in the past three months were share-croppers, forced to avail private loans from money-lenders as they were denied credit from the co-operative banks.        
	These farmers allegedly ended their lives after failing to repay the loans as well as pay for the land rent following kharif crop failure.        
	Though the government is contemplating the move to provide co-operative loans to the share-croppers, they have to fulfil certain conditions. In this case, landlords will have to identify the share-croppers applying for the loans and certify that the latter has taken the land on rent for cultivation.         
	It has been also being proposed that a list of share-croppers would be made, which will help the government to formulate policies for them. Meanwhile, the state has decided to raise loan amount to be disbursed during rabi season from Rs 1,095 crore to Rs 1,124 crore.         
	It is also formulating a package for the farm sector on the basis of recommendation of agriculture production commissioner and a fact-finding committee of the ruling BJD that visited the affected areas in Sambalpur and Jharsuguda districts.        
	These two areas saw the maximum number of suicide cases being reported.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Vasundhara defiance bares BJP turmoil
                                                                                                               Vasundhara defiance bares BJP turmoil
          SANJAY K. JHA AND RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR                          LK Advani                                  
	New Delhi/Jaipur, Aug. 13: Vasundhara Rajes refusal to resign as leader of the Opposition in the Rajasthan Assembly despite a directive from BJP president Rajnath Singh is the latest sign of the central leaderships weakening grip over the party organisation.        
	Rajnaths decision to remove the former chief minister has the support of L.K. Advani and the Sangh parivar.        
	Party sources have tried to dismiss suggestions about the leaderships waning authority by arguing Raje has neither said anything on record nor questioned the high commands decision internally so far.        
	She would be sacked if she formally communicates her disagreement, a senior leader said, adding that Raje should be given time to make up her mind.        
	But the majority view is that it is an open act of defiance by Raje who was asked to quit four days ago. She initially tried to ignore Rajnaths directive and is now trying to muster support of party MLAs.        
	The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and Rajnath wanted her to go soon after the Assembly election defeat but she survived thanks to Advanis support. Sources say that even Advani is now convinced that her continuance is untenable because of her style of functioning.        
	But Raje seems to be following in the footsteps of Advani, who is resisting Sangh pressure to step down as leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha.        
	The Rajasthan BJP is divided on the issue. New state unit president Arun Chaturvedi publicly admits the high command has asked Raje to step down.        
	Although there is no official intimation, what we have unofficially heard is that Raje has been asked to put in her papers, he said.        
	But Raje has been camping with her supporters and MLAs at her residence and is saying she has not received any orders to step down.        
	Staunch Raje supporter and former minister Rajendra Singh Rathore said: Till now there is no official indication of resignation. Why should she be asked to resign? It is the right of the MLAs to choose their leader in the House, and we have 60 MLAs out of the total 78 on our side.        
	Chaturvedi, however, said: There is no room for defiance in the BJP.        
	One senior BJP leader in Delhi admitted: The ugly tussle among senior leaders, the mutual distrust, and the diminishing moral authority of both Advani and Rajnath have created a mess in the party. This cannot be redeemed till a clear hierarchical line is drawn and all top leaders demonstrate unity of purpose.                  Vasundhara Raje      
	This is an unusual situation for the BJP, which ran for decades on the strength of the moral authority the Vajpayee-Advani duo commanded in the party.        
	Advanis future too is uncertain and Rajnaths authority has been perpetually in doubt. The organisational flux has deepened over the past few days amid speculation over Advanis meeting with Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat.        
	Although Advani has reaffirmed he would continue as leader of the Opposition for five years, sources discount this possibility, saying all senior Sangh leaders except Madan Das Devi want a change.        
	The sources said a meeting of top Sangh leaders was scheduled in September to discuss BJP affairs, and that it would take far-reaching decisions even if the August 17-19 chintan baithak is an eyewash.

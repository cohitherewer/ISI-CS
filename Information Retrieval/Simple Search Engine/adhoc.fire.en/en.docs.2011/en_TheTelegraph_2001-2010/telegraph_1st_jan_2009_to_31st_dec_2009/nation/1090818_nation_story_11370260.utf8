	Cuttack, Aug. 17: A watchman of a destitute home was arrested yesterday for repeated sexual assault on a 15-year-old inmate.        
	The FIR lodged with Mahila police station states that Kashinath Bhoi alias Banku, the guard of Vasundhara Destitute Home at Gatirautpatana, had forceful sexual intercourse with the teenager in a room at the home on August 14 morning. Her screams for help went unnoticed.        
	Vasundhara took in the victim following a request from her mother two years ago. The girl from Buguda area near Berhampur was reportedly suffering from mental illness and the destitute home had undertaken her treatment.        
	She narrated her plight to a schoolteacher, Kalyani Rout, who rescued her near railway tracks at Kandarpur, 10km from from the home, on August 14 evening.         
	The complaint lodged by Rout alleged that Banku had earlier raped the girl several times during the past three months.

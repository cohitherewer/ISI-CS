          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug 18: Assam governor Syed Sibtey Razi today denied the Prime Minister had asked him to quit.         
	I have neither been told to quit, nor am I going to quit till October (when his term ends), he said after meeting home minister P. Chidambaram.         
	Razi took over as Assam governor on July 27 amid controversy surrounding his former aides in Jharkhand. They have been charged with corruption.        
	There was a buzz that Manmohan Singh had asked him to quit after the furore.        
	Today, he said: Yeh bilkul galat hai (this is absolutely false).         
	Sources in the PMO also said there was no truth in reports that Razi was told to go.         
	Razi had himself been the centre of controversy as Jharkhand governor when he refused to let the NDA form a government in the state.

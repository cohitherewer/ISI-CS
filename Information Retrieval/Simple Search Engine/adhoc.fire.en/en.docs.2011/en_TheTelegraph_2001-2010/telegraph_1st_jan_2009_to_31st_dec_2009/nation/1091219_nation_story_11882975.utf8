          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Energy factor                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 18: Paucity of funds has prompted the Orissa government to seek a Rs 5,000-crore assistance from the 13th Finance Commission for upgrading the transmission and distribution system.        
	Orissa has 84,000km transmission line, of which around 62,000km are more than 40 years old, which require immediate replacement. An estimated Rs 2,000 crore is required for upgrading of transmission system in the state by 2014-15.        
	Besides, it needs Rs 3,400 crore for strengthening distribution network by 2014-15.        
	Though the power distribution system has been privatised in the state, private companies have not come forward to finance strengthening of distribution network. The government has, therefore, sought Rs 5,000-crore assistance from the 13th Finance Commission for upgrading the transmission and distribution system, said energy minister Atanu Sabyasachi Nayak.        
	Since there is a need for heavy capital investment, the finance department has suggested to the Orissa Power Transmission Corporation Limited, a state-owned enterprise, to avail the benefits of the central scheme for upgrading infrastructure through public-private partnership.        
	Chairing a high-level meeting to take stock of power infrastructure in the state, chief minister Naveen Patnaik today asked officials to speed up upgrading transmission and distribution system to cope with additional power generation as well as the growing demand because of rural electrification.        
	By 2014-15, six to seven mega thermal power plants are expected to generate additional 10,000MW power.                          
	A target has been set to electrify all villages by 2010 end under the Rajiv Gandhi Gramin Vidyutkaran Yojana.        
	Meanwhile, the OPTCL has been sanctioned a Rs 700-crore loan from the Power Finance Corporation and the Rural Electrification Corporation for strengthening transmission system, the energy minister said.

	Panaji, Dec. 25 (PTI): Two Russian women have alleged that a taxi driver tried to rape them at Anjuna beach when they were returning from a Christmas party last night.        
	The girls said in their complaint, lodged at Anjuna police station, that they jumped out of the taxi to escape and hid in the woods for almost five hours waiting for dawn.        
	Olga Tyurina, 29, and Irina Babayan, 25, were returning from a discotheque at Saligao in north Goa after attending a Christmas party.        
	The girls, who know little English, have told the police that the cabbie they had hired to drop them at their hotel in Baga took them to Anjuna beach, where British teenager Scarlett Keeling was found dead after suspected rape in February 2008.        
	The Russian girls said the taxi driver initially had agreed to take them to their hotel for Rs 300, but took them down another road on the pretext of avoiding a police picket at 2.20am. He then stopped at Anjuna beach and demanded Rs 1,000, they said.        
	When they protested, he tried to grab them.         
	We were horrified and jumped out of the taxi and took shelter in the woods nearby, one of the girls said. The girls said they were in the jungle for almost five hours and came out only in the morning. The police complaint was lodged at 7am today.         
	The police confirmed that a complaint of attempt to rape had been lodged. We will soon get his custody, an officer said.        
	Earlier this month, a 25-year-old Russian was allegedly raped by Goa politician John Fernandes, who is on the run.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Telangana storm drives films to TN 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Telangana storm drives films to TN 
          G.C. SHEKHAR                              
	Chennai, Dec. 27: The statehood storm has brought smiles to the celluloid world in neighbouring Tamil Nadu.        
	Many Telugu film production houses are planning to shift their shoots, disrupted by the Telangana violence, to Chennai. At least one Tamil filmmaker scheduled to shoot in Hyderabad has preferred to stay put in Chennai.        
	Sasikumar, Tamil cinemas most successful producer-director in the last two years, had leased a large portion of the Ramoji Rao Film City for an untitled venture.        
	But once he heard about the attacks on film units and personalities by pro-Telangana agitators, he decided to shoot in and around Chennai. I normally can a movie within four months so I cannot afford to have any unpleasant surprises, said Sasikumar.        
	Since most of Telugu cinemas heroes are from the non-Telangana region, their movies and production units could become targets of the pro-statehood agitators.        
	A set worth Rs 1.30 crore erected for a film starring Mahesh Babu and Anushka at Vikarabad in Ranga Reddy district of the Telangana region was destroyed after being set on fire by pro-statehood agitators. In a separate incident, the farmhouse of actor Pawan Kalyan at Shankarpally, outside Hyderabad, was attacked.         
	Angered by Praja Rajyam leader Chiranjeevis decision to campaign for a samaikya (integrated) Andhra, Telangana activists attacked the crew of Varudu, a film in which the superstars nephew Allu Arjun is playing the lead, at Anshanapally near the Ramoji Film City.        
	The spate of attacks has brought shooting of Telugu films in and around Hyderabad to a standstill, forcing producers to look for safer zones. Chennai became a natural choice because of the long association Telugu and Kannada cinema has had with the city.         
	Till the early 80s, most of the Telugu and Kannada films continued to be shot in Chennai, then called Madras. N.T. Rama Rao, the Andhra star who founded the Telugu Desam, and Kannada matinee idol Rajkumar had houses in Chennai. The Telugu film industry shifted to Hyderabad in the late-eighties, during the Congress regime of M. Channa Reddy who offered land and soft loans to build studios and cinemas and constructed housing colonies for technicians and artistes.        
	At least 25 per cent of the Telugu cinema production is likely to come to Chennai. Already many production managers are calling their counterparts in Chennai to line up shooting spots and equipment, said V.C. Guhanathan, president of the Film Employees Federation of South India. Those who wish to continue to shoot in Andhra are moving their schedules to Visakhapatnam or Tirupati, he added.        
	Many Tamil films are also regularly shot in Hyderabad, especially at the Ramoji Rao Film City. The two superhits of Rajnikanth and Kamal Haasan  Sivaji and Dasavatharam  were shot there. A few scenes of Rajnikanths under-production film Enthiran were also filmed in the facility.        
	 Any disruption in the schedule amounts to a huge loss of money, not just because of damage to property but also because the call sheets of top stars need to be rearranged, said D. Ramnarayanan, president of the Tamil Film Producers Council.

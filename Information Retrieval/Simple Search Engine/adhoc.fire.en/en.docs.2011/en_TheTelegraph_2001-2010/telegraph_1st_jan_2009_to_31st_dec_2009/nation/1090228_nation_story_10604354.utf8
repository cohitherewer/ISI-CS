          NISHIT DHOLABHAI AND AGENCIES                          Congress president Sonia Gandhi matches steps with tribal women at Kothagudem in Andhra Pradesh, where she held a public meeting on Friday that virtually launched the partys election campaign in the state. Vote for Congress, she said in Telugu at the end of her 30-minute speech in which she spoke of the work the partys government has done for the poor in the past five years.

	New Delhi, Feb. 27: Home minister P. Chidambaram today made it clear the UPA would not pass up the chance to make a poll plank out of Pakistans red face.        
	Setting the tone for the election campaign at a monthly media briefing, he liberally patted the government  and his ministry  for forcing a confession out of Pakistan that the Mumbai attacks were partly plotted on its soil.        
	That admission was a signal victory for the UPA governments cerebral foreign policy and coercive diplomacy, he said.        
	Countering cross-border terrorism is, to a large degree, a mind game. Our diplomacy has yielded results.        
	Harping on the diplomatic victory as one of the UPAs biggest achievements in the run-up to the elections, Chidambaram said Pakistan seemed to have made a virtue out of prevarication till it ran out of options.        
	After prevaricating for several weeks, Pakistan was forced to admit that its territory was used to plot and carry out the terrorist attacks.        
	He used the context to sting Pakistan Navy chief Admiral Noman Bashir for claiming there was no proof that captured terrorist Ajmal Kasab had reached Mumbai through Pakistani territorial waters.        
	I am sure somebody will deny tomorrow what the naval chief has said. This is part of prevarication, he said, possibly reminding the audience that extracting the 26/11 admission from Pakistan had taken some doing.        
	In a different meeting, junior foreign minister Anand Sharma played up the same point. He said the UPA had not only managed to get a UN Security Council resolution on the attacks in a short time, it had got key countries speaking in one voice for India. We were clear-headed, he said.        
	Chidambaram also talked of measures taken to beef up safety in the attacks aftermath. He said a 100-day action plan had been launched on February 21 to tighten intelligence gathering and tone up the security apparatus.        
	We will back our diplomatic efforts with a high degree of preparedness to meet any terrorist threat or attack.        
	He said some steps taken in the US after 9/11 would be replicated in India in consonance with conditions prevailing here.        
	On Indias reply to the 30 questions raised by Pakistan, he said the answers were still being formulated, but many were available in the Mumbai police chargesheet.        
	Pressed on when they would be ready, he said: When I am satisfied with the answer. I feel by next week I will be satisfied.

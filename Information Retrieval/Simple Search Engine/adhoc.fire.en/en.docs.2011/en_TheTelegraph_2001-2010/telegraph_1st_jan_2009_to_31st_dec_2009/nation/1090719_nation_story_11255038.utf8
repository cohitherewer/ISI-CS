The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | The loads now on Sibals class
                                                                                                               The loads now on Sibals class
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           Kapil Sibal                                  
	New Delhi, July 18: Tasked with spearheading an unprecedented expansion in Indias education, the human resource development ministry is fortifying itself  through its own expansion.         
	Burdened with responsibility for more education institutions and programmes than ever before, Kapil Sibals HRD ministry is beefing up its strength of bureaucrats and trained experts to pacify officials complaining about inhuman workload.         
	The ministry has approved a demand from officials for a technical support group for the school education departments landmark Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan aimed at universalising secondary education, ministry insiders said.         
	And the higher education department has demanded a whole new bureau in charge of only central universities which are set to more than double under the XIth Five Year Plan, sources said.         
	It is the expansion before the expansion. And believe me, it is absolutely necessary, a source said, arguing that the ministry with its existing strength  in number of trained personnel  simply cannot manage the inhuman workload it is now finding itself under.         
	Consider the dizzying, almost overnight, hike in the ministrys workload.         
	The department of school education and literacy, one of the ministrys arms, has this entire decade focussed its energies on the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan to universalise primary education and on the mid-day meal scheme.         
	It also looks after adult education and general schooling. But apart from basic policy, most schemes and plans for schools are monitored by officials of autonomous school bodies that come under the ministry.         
	These bodies include the Central Board of Secondary Education, the Council for Indian School Certificate Examination, the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan, the Navodaya Vidyalaya Sangathan and the Central Tibetan Schools Authority.         
	Last year, the mid-day meal scheme, initially started for students of Classes I to V, was extended up to Class VIII under a long-pending plan.         
	And earlier this year, the RMSA  which aims at replicating the success of the SSA in secondary schooling  was launched, with the challenge of retaining in school every child who completes class V.         
	But the departments biggest new challenge is on the horizon. Once the Right to Education Bill, to be tabled in Parliament next week, is passed, the department will be legally responsible for providing schooling to every child between 6 and 14.         
	Higher education department officials are cringing under the XIth plans pressure, too.         
	Sixty-one years after Independence, India had seven IITs, six IIMs and 24 central universities  the countrys apex higher educational institutions  till 2008.         
	In a month from now, the number of IITs would become 15  with two fresh institutes starting this year in addition to six that started last year.         
	The number of IIMs, seven as of today  with an IIM in Shillong started last year  is set to go up to 14, more than doubling the number of 2008 like in the case of the IITs.         
	Seven new IIMs  including the one in Shillong  had been promised under the plan, but a budget speech error has resulted in Rajasthan additionally earning an IIM.         
	This years academic session will see 15 new central universities join the 24 existing ones. These 15 include three which were state universities till recently, and have been converted.         
	And the government has committed to adding another 14 central universities of world-class standards under the plan.         
	In addition, the number of National Institutes of Technology are set to rise by 10, from 20 to 30. The department is also in charge of opening 20 new Indian Institutes of Information Technology.

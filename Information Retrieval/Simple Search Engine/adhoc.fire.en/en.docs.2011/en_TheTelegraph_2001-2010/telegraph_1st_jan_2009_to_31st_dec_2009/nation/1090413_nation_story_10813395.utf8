The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rice politics stokes anger at twin crooks   Suicide belt spots ploy
                                                                                                               Rice politics stokes anger at twin crooks     -  Suicide belt spots ploy
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI IN YAVATMAL                           Tukaram Rawaji Mesharam (left) and Nitin Deshmukh in Pandharkoda, Yavatmal district                                        
	Mention the rice subsidies both the Congress and the BJP are offering in their manifestos, and run the risk of fiery glares from the otherwise jovial Nitin Deshmukh and the quiet Tukaram Rawaji Mesharam.         
	The Congresss offer of 10kg of rice for Rs 35 for the poor and the BJPs repartee promise of Rs 25 for the same quantity may help the countrys two largest parties attract voters elsewhere.        
	But in the heart of Indias farm suicide belt, these promises are a red rag for farmers like Deshmukh who fear that cheap agricultural produce for the poor in Delhi or Mumbai could mean more deaths in Vidarbha.         
	In 2004, Deshmukh supported the BJP like many other farmers in Vidarbha, leading to the rout of the Congress, which won only one of the 11 Lok Sabha seats from the region.        
	But this time, Deshmukh minces no words in his combined disgust for both the Congress and the BJP, symbolised in his anger over the competitive rice promises the two parties have made.         
	Both the Congress and the BJP have shown themselves to be labad (crooks), making fools of us farmers, said the 45-year-old.         
	Mesharam, a cotton farmer, said farmers had falsely believed for several years that government subsidies for the poor were independent of the market rates at which farmers sold their produce.         
	What happens is something quite different. Instead of buying our produce at market rates and then subsidising it for the poor, the government first imports produce and pumps it into the market to push down prices, alleged Mesharam.                     
	The Vidarbha Jan Andolan Samiti, an NGO that has called for national focus on the suicide-stricken region, blames the lack of price security for the farmer suicides. Vidarbha has witnessed over 4,000 farm-related suicides since 2004, according to the Samiti. Cotton and rice are the regions most widely grown crops.        
	The Prime Minister had announced a Rs 3,750-crore relief package for Vidarbha in 2006. But several NGOs, academics and farmers have labelled the package an eyewash. They accuse the government of failing to address the principal reason behind the suicides  the mismatch between cost incurred by farmers and the prices offered for their produce.         
	In 2008, then finance minister P. Chidambaram announced an unprecedented loan waiver for debt-ridden farmers, a scheme that was expected to help the worst hit in Vidarbha. But a year later, farmers across the region complain that the richer areas of western Maharashtra and Marathwada have benefited the most.        
	We have been left high and dry yet again, cried Renubai Kalbande, pleading not to be photographed. Why are these people offering more subsidies for city people? We are poor, but at least I still have my husband (he hasnt committed suicide like many others). I dont want to lose him, too.

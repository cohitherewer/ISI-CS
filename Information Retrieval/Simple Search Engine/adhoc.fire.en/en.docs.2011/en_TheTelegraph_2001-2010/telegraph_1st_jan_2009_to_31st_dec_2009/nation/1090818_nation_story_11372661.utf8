The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | School assembly bar for flu
                                                                                                               School assembly bar for flu
          OUR BUREAU                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 17: The government will issue a fresh flu advisory to schools asking them to stop assemblies and events that involve large congregrations such as cultural or sports gatherings, health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad said today.         
	Azad hinted that his ministrys advisory would emphasise that schools need not shut down but that they need to take other steps to prevent the possible spread of the pandemic flu among students or staff.         
	Assemblies will be temporarily suspended, Azad said, and teachers would be asked to check each student to find out who appears to have symptoms of flu and make arrangements to send them home.         
	Sources said the government appeared to have drawn on a set of guidelines, issued by the Centers for Disease Control in the US, to derive the new advisory.         
	The American advisory issued on August 7 mentioned several ways of increasing social distance within the school environment such as dividing classes into small groups, moving desks further apart and moving classes to larger spaces.         
	Actions like these are unlikely to be implemented in Indian schools with crowded classes, a public health expert said. Instead, a temporary curb on assemblies and large gatherings would be considered feasible.         
	But medical experts also questioned the uniform application of such guidelines across India. We have to ask whether such measures are justified in small towns where there is no flu at all? an expert asked, speaking on condition of anonymity.         
	Health screening today found the H1N1 flu virus in 220 new patients from 17 cities, including three in Calcutta.         
	Only two patients in Mumbai have a history of foreign travel  the other 118 patients picked up the virus locally.         
	The infection has killed 25 people in India so far.

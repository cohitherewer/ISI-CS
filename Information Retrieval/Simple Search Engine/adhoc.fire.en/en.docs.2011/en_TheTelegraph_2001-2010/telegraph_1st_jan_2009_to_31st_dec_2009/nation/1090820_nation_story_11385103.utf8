          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhopal, Aug. 19: If you want to carry live cartridges on a flight, Your Highness, you have to declare them.        
	T.S. Singhdeo, former maharaja of Sarguja, was stopped at Raja Bhoj airport here this morning while going through the security check. The Congress legislator from Ambikapur Assembly segment in Chhattisgarh was carrying 10 live cartridges of a .270 bore rifle.        
	Popularly addressed as T.S. Baba or Baba Saheb, the ex-royal initially did not appear to understand the fuss as he kept insisting that the cartridges belonged to his wife, who reportedly has an arms licence.        
	But Singhdeos wife was not accompanying him. The MLA, whose family is highly respected in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, was arrested under sections of the Arms Act, Bhopal police chief Jaideep Prasad said.        
	Under the act, carrying firearms or ammunition without a written declaration at the time of checking in at a restricted area like an airport is against the law. Punishments vary from fine to imprisonment or both.        
	Singhdeo, 58, was handed over to Bhopal police by the CISF and later released on bail.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 4: The Supreme Court has said it is unable to stop politically timed release of inquiry reports and asked the Centre to explain if commissions can submit more than one report on an incident.         
	The court was hearing a petition filed by an NGO, Citizens for Justice and Peace, challenging the release of the Nanavati Commission report. The commission was set up by Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi to probe the Godhra train fire and the riots that followed.        
	In an interim report, the commission had given a clean chit to the chief minister and his council of ministers.         
	Earlier, the U.C. Banerjee panel, set up by then railway minister Lalu Prasad, had dubbed the incident purely accidental. The Supreme Court had stayed that report.        
	At the hearing today, Aparna Bhatt, the counsel for the NGO, sought action against the release of inquiry reports to further political motives.         
	What can we do about that? a bench, headed by the Chief Justice of India, K.G. Balakrishnan, asked.         
	The court said the NGO could challenge the final findings of the Nanavati commission once they were made public.        
	The court, however, wondered whether a particular inquiry commission could present several reports on one incident. Or can a commission give one report and another later depending on political convenience? the court asked.         
	At this point, solicitor-general Gopal Subramanium, appearing for the Union government, said: Commissions were expected to do quick inquiries but now they represent a part report, an interim report etc.         
	The court has granted three weeks to the Centre to file its reply.

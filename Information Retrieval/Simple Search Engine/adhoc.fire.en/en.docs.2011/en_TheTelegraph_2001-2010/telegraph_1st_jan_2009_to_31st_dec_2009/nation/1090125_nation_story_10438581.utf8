                                                                                                               Family amp; strangers keep vigil 
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                      Gurmeet Singh, a resident of Jungpura in New Delhi, walked into AIIMS on Saturday wearing the Prime Minister rsquo;s trademark blue turban, white kurta-pyjama and Nehru jacket. ldquo;I have come here to wish our Prime Minister. I hope and pray that the operation becomes successful, rdquo; Singh rsquo;s lookalike (in PTI picture) said. The father of two was stopped by the SPG who told him he could write down his wishes for the Prime Minister in a diary provided at the hospital, which he did.                           
	New Delhi, Jan. 24: The clock had just struck seven.         
	Outside, a thick blanket of winter-morning fog hung heavy. Inside, you could hear a pin drop.        
	With 7,000 patients visiting the hospital every day, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences buzzes with activity. Today, things were different.        
	Patients, relatives and even bystanders outside the hospital kept their silence as the countrys top surgeons readied the Prime Minister for surgery, as if even their mild stirrings could affect the concentration of the 11 doctors at work on their leader.        
	The chaiwallah outside knew it was time for prayer. I saw on TV the PM was going to be admitted here. Yes, I have been worried. I have seen many patients go in there. Some come back, some dont. Their relatives talk about all that standing here in my shop. I always say a silent prayer for them, said Ratul Gupta.        
	The PM is special. I have been asking the policemen standing here how he is at regular intervals, but they dont know much. But I am sure he will come back healthy, he has the best wishes of all of us.        
	The Prime Ministers wife, Gursharan Kaur, his eldest daughter Upinder, a professor of history at St Stephens College, and her husband Vijay Tankha kept vigil at the private waiting room near Singhs hospital bed.        
	The Prime Ministers elder brother, Surjit Singh Kohli, arrived from Punjab. He looked tense as he walked out of the hospital during the day, his grave face sending a frisson of fear among the people waiting outside.        
	Sources in AIIMS said Singh, 76, woke up around 6 this morning and greeted the attendants and his family. He then prayed before the doctors started preparations for the surgery. It was 6.45.        
	Just over an hour later, the operation had started.        
	Over the next several hours, people trooped in and out of the hospital. Some just waited at the front gate. The bolder among them walked up to security officials to ask how the surgery was going.        
	I came straight from the gurdwara. I said a prayer for him, wishing that he gets home soon. Thats the only thing commoners like us can do, said Ranjit Singh, who didnt enter the hospital but waited at the gate for about 30 minutes.        
	Late in the evening, doctors said the prayers had been answered and the surgery was successful.

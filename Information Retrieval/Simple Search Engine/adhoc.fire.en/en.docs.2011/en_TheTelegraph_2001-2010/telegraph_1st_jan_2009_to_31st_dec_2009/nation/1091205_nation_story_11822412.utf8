	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 4: Barely 12 hours after World Disability Day celebrations, a 20-year-old visually challenged woman was allegedly raped by a taxi driver at Bhubaneswar railway station here today.        
	The victim had boarded a train from Jagatsinghpur and had got down here this morning. She told the police that a taxi driver, Bikash Behera, misled her and took her to an unknown place and raped her.        
	The woman, a resident of Jagatsinghpur, was going to her relatives place in Dumduma on the outskirts of the city when Bikash, spotted her moving on the platform, offered to take her to Dumduma.        
	Instead, he took her to an isolated place and forced himself on her.        
	Later, a few local residents helped her to reach the Government Railway Police, which referred the case to Mahila police station. She said the man took her to an unknown place and raped her. She said she could not identify the accused, as she is visually challenged. We took her to a government hospital, where she was examined to confirm sexual assault. The reports are yet to come, said Mahila police station inspector Madhuri Samal.        
	Behera was arrested later and interrogation was on, said a police officer. A case has been registered, the officer added. The victim was admitted to a private hospital, said a woman rights activist.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PIL to ban pen using Gandhi for profit 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      PIL to ban pen using Gandhi for profit 
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 3: Mahatma Gandhi is a symbol of simplicity and therefore cannot be used to sell exorbitantly priced luxury ware, a PIL filed in the Supreme Court has said, challenging Mont Blancs decision to put his face on its limited-edition pens, priced at Rs 12 lakh each.         
	The German company had released 241 pens made of 18-carat gold in the Indian market recently to commemorate Gandhis 140th birthday.        
	The petition rejected Mont Blancs claim that the company intended to honour Gandhi by putting a picture of him with a walking stick and his signature on their pens.         
	It is totally false that this project is intended to honour the man, the PIL, filed by two lawyers, said. The company has kept the prices high to encash maximum profits, it said. In the garb of honouring the man, some people were using the Mahatma as a poster boy for commercial gains, the PIL charged.         
	The petitioners attached a copy of a booklet released by the company, featuring several of Gandhis widely quoted lines along with the caption that said: The pen is mightier than the sword.         
	The brand and the people associated with the project must apologise to the Mahatma for using him for commercial gain, the petition said.         
	Section 3 of the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950, says Gandhis pictures cannot be used for the purpose of any trade, business or profession, the petition said.         
	The petition requested the court to direct the Union government to restrain the company from using the image of the Mahatma.         
	The Supreme Court is expected to hear the petition on December 7, 2009.

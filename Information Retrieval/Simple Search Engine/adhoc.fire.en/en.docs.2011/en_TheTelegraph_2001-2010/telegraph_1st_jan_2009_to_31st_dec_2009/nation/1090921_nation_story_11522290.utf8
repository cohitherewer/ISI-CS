The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | First-class line-up for economy Krishna
                                                                                                               First-class line-up for economy Krishna
          K.P. NAYAR                            Krishna, Clinton                                 
	New York, Sept. 20: He may be arriving at New Yorks John F. Kennedy airport by cattle class, but that will not stop S.M. Krishna from being the second most popular foreign minister  after Hillary Clinton  at the 64th UN General Assembly during the next seven days.        
	Of the 192 foreign ministers who will be competing for their place under the sun here at the biggest gathering of leaders, Krishna has received 54 requests for bilateral meetings with his counterparts from all over the world.        
	That number is exceeded only by Americas Clinton, who received 86 requests for bilateral meetings, according to a source at the US permanent mission to the UN.        
	No other foreign minister has received nearly as many requests for bilateral meetings, according to multiple sources at the high-level segment of the General Assembly which will open on Wednesday to be addressed, among others, by President Barack Obama.        
	The interest in Krishna has been closely matched by a keenness to engage Indias new foreign secretary, Nirupama Rao, in substantive dialogue.         
	Rao arrived in New York this morning for the General Assembly, but was immediately spirited away by the Americans to Washington for detailed discussions on Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs visit to the US in November.        
	Perhaps empathising with Krishnas cattle class fatigue on the long haul from New Delhi to New York, Rao travelled to Washington from the Big Apple today by a chair car-equipped Acela train, the US version of Rahul Gandhis now famous rail trip by Shatabdi Express to Ludhiana last week.        
	The Americans usually discourage foreign leaders and officials arriving in New York for the General Assembly from visiting Washington as an incidental add-on to their trip, but in Raos case the reverse has happened.        
	Her counterpart, the US under-secretary of state for political affairs, William Burns, was very keen to follow up the outcome of Clintons recent trip to India in the context of Singhs visit, away from the distractions of UN work in New York, although the bigwigs at the state department are already at the world body and will remain there for the next 10 days.        
	Although Krishna had asked Rao to join the Indian delegation for talks with Clinton in July as an officer on special duty while she was waiting to take charge as foreign secretary, this will be her first solo engagement with the career leadership of the US diplomatic corps. An American source said Burns and his boss, the deputy secretary of state, James Steinberg, were keen that as a goodwill gesture this should take place at Foggy Bottom, the seat of the state department and not at a third party venue in New York.        
	Although Krishna received 54 requests from other foreign ministers to meet him in the next seven days, Indias permanent mission to the UN has not been able to accommodate all the requests since the minister has a very tight schedule at the UN, which includes a climate change summit on Tuesday, attended by 124 countries, many of them at the level of heads of state, a Group of 15 (G15) summit and his own address to the General Assembly.        
	Ironically, however, Krishna will actually end up meeting more foreign ministers than Clinton. This is because he will meet 53 Commonwealth foreign ministers at a single meeting, which is being called in view of the Commonwealth summit to be held in Trinidad and Tobago in November that will be attended by the Prime Minister.        
	In addition, Krishna will represent Singh at the G15 summit, attend a Bric luncheon and interact with the foreign ministers of Brazil, Russia and China, attend a ministerial meeting of Ibsa, the group binding India, Brazil and South Africa, have a collective political dialogue with his Gulf Co-operation Council counterparts and attend ministerial meetings of the Group of 77 and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, to list a few programmes on his itinerary.         
	Of course, Krishna will have a separate meeting with Clinton.        
	In order to accommodate requests from a wide cross-section of others, Indias permanent representative to the UN, Hardeep Puri, is hosting a reception on Thursday for the minister.        
	In addition to Rao and Puri, Krishna will be assisted at the General Assembly by the minister of state for environment and forests, Jairam Ramesh, and the special envoy to the Prime Minister on climate change, Shyam Saran.

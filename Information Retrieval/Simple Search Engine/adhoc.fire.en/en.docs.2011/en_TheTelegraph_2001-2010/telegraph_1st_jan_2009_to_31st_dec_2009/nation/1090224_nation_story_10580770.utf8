          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                      
	Calcutta, Feb. 23: The state government today announced a Rs 5,100-crore fiscal stimulus package, pledging rice at Rs 2 a kg to the poor and promising to recruit 50,000 primary teachers.        
	It hiked part-time and para-teachers salaries and aid to workers of closed factories and tea gardens. It announced two universities in Jalpaiguri and Purulia-Bankura, and promised new primary and higher secondary schools, junior and high madarsas, and 1,000 vocational training centres.        
	Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee called the move an election gimmick and a stunt, but the state finance minister dismissed the proximity to the polls as a strange coincidence.        
	It just so happens that the recession and elections are at the same time. If theres such a strange coincidence, I cant help it, Asim Dasgupta said, announcing the package after a meeting with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.        
	The main objective is to grant specific relief and assistance to 33 sectors of the state economy.        
	Dasgupta said this would cost the exchequer Rs 5,106 crore, and promised to get implementation started before the fiscal ended on March 31.        
	Dasgupta announced a pension rise from Rs 500 to Rs 750 for the aged, widows and the disabled, and a hike in honorarium for practitioners of homoeopathy, Unani and Ayurveda at the panchayats from Rs 5,000 to Rs 8,000.        
	A housing scheme for below-poverty-line and other low-income groups will be launched in rural and urban areas. For this, Rs 1,000 crore has been earmarked. We plan to build and repair houses for 1.5 lakh people every year.        
	The rise in aid to workers of closed factories and tea gardens takes care of an assurance given to the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha. The package includes development funds for north Bengal, Paschimanchal and the Sunderbans.        
	Dasgupta said the state would bear a fifth of the cost of implementing the revised University Grants Commission pay scales for college and university teachers. It will upgrade roads and bridges and contribute funds to the East-West Metro project.        
	The package includes an interest slash from 9 to 4 per cent on loans to self-help groups, a land bank for large and medium industries, and help for the IT sector to expand the e-governance network.

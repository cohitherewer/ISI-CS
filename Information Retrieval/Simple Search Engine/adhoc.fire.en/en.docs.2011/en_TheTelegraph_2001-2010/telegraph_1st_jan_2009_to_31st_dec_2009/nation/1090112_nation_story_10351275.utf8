  - Rs 1.51cr to improve police infrastructure          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 11: Special cells for serious physical violence, cyber crime, economic offences, violence against women and children, land grabbing and property offences are being viewed as the new additions to police commissionerate of the twin cities of Bhubaneswar and Cuttack by next year.        
	A proposal to this effect has already been placed before the state government, said police commissioner Bijay Sharma, after releasing comparative crime figures under 10 major heads on the completion of its first year.        
	A total of 6,636 crimes were reported in 2008  a distinct dip of 10.45 per cent from the number of crime reported in 2007 that stood at 7,411 Notwithstanding the impressive numbers, the crime graph has shown an increasing trend in murder, dacoity, rioting and rape.        
	While the incidence of murder has increased by 23 per cent, dacoity, rape and rioting have risen by 69, 18 and 4 per cent, respectively. However, avoidable offences, including robbery, burglary, theft, swindling, motor vehicle accident and miscellaneous cases, showed a marked decline.        
	Describing the overall crime situation under control, Sharma gave the credits to effective enforcement and the compounding power of the commissionerate. With urbanisation and more awareness among public, the increase in the number of cases is obvious. But the efficiency of police is to be judged by its capacity to check the preventable offences and detection rates, Sharma said.        
	The murder and rape detection rates stand at 96 per cent, while for robbery and motor vehicle accidents, the detection rates stand at 64 per cent and 90 per cent, respectively.        
	The commissionerate is also quite positive about its new Dial 100 scheme for the twin cities. We will provide specialised training for personnel handling it. They will be trained how to handle a call and how to respond better, said Sharma. The Rs 1.51-crore scheme would involve improved tracking and monitoring. There are also plans to increase the number of police control room vans.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Memory trip for Hillary
                                                                                                               Memory trip for Hillary
          K.P.NAYAR                          Hillary                                  
	Washington, July 16: When US secretary of state Hillary Clintons special aircraft touches down in Mumbai tomorrow night on her three-day visit to India, it will be a trip down memory lane for the only woman who came almost a heartbeat away from being Americas President.        
	Contrary to the custom of US embassies in host countries and the state departments vast machinery putting together their secretarys overseas tour schedule, Clinton personally chose what she would do in Mumbai, according to US officials who have knowledge of how her itinerary was constructed here.        
	Again, contrary to diplomatic correctness, Clinton decided that she would spend two days in Mumbai as opposed to only one day in Delhi where her routine programme of meeting leaders of the UPA, its government and the leader of the Opposition has been left to her staff to organise.        
	Clinton wants to leave a personal imprint on her first visit to India as secretary of state because she fervently believes that it was she  not her husband Bill or his successor George W. Bush  who began the transformation of Indo-US relations after the end of the Cold War.        
	In her book, Living History, Clinton recalls the start of her trip to India as First Lady, which, she insists in private conversations, launched what has now become of Indo-US relations at its zenith.        
	On a cold afternoon late in March 1995, I took my first extended trip overseas without the President. Forty-one passengers filled a vintage government jet and took off from Andrews Air Force Base for a 12-day official visit to five countries in South Asia.        
	On Saturday, in Mumbai, Clinton will relive her most vivid memories of that trip which were not of the Taj Mahal, breathtaking as it was but of two visits I made in the city of Ahmedabad.        
	She writes in the book of how she was overwhelmed and uplifted by a visit to the Self-Employed Womens Association (SEWA). At the end of her meeting, Ela Bhatt, SEWAs founder, announced that the women there wanted to express gratitude for Clintons visit.        
	In a stunning flash of moving colour, they all sprang to their feet and began singing we shall overcome in Gujarati... For me, they were a living affirmation of human rights. When Clintons trip to Indiawas being crafted in the last several weeks, she insisted that she wanted to meet the women of SEWA again. She will do so in Mumbai this weekend.        
	During her eight years as a US Senator from New York and as co-chair of the Senates India caucus, Clinton developed a close bond with Ratan Tata, who headed the Indian side of the joint CEOs Forum and helped push a number Indo-US private sector initiatives.        
	As a result, she will probably spend more time in the company of Tata than with any Indian minister or political leader. She will also stay at a Taj hotel, the Taj Mahal, in Mumbai.        
	The worry, however, is that officials from Washington, political appointees who have no institutional memory of Clintons initiatives on India as First Lady 14 years ago, are capable to upsetting her political apple cart. Contrary to what Clinton would have liked, from some accounts, the US assistant secretary of state for South Asia, yesterday played down the symbolism of her visit to Mumbai. There will be a much wider range of activities beyond simply any kind of commemoration of what happened there, Blake told reporters yesterday. It goes well beyond simply the commemorative aspects that you talked about.         
	Politically, Clinton needs to make her India trip a grand success, going beyond signing agreements in New Delhi and being photographed with prime minister Manmohan Singh and others. A month of limited exposure from a fractured elbow has enabled Vice-President Joe Biden to move to the centre stage of US foreign policy at a time when Clinton was already struggling to live down the impression that President Barack Obama  and not the secretary of state  was this administrations top diplomat.         
	In this context, an Indian signature on the end-use verification agreement for US defence supplies would add substance to non-political aspects of the visit, which Clinton is very good at.

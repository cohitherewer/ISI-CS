The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | 22 MLAs miss Orissa tickets
                                                                                                               22 MLAs miss Orissa tickets
          SUBRAT DAS                               
	Bhubaneswar, April 9: As and when dates for the election were declared, as many as 22 sitting MLAs had not imagined that they would not get an opportunity to fight.         
	Four-time BJD MLA from Athgarh Ranendra Pratap Swain was granted a party ticket, but was debarred from the polls on technical grounds. Swains nomination was rejected by the returning officer as he had not submitted the original copy of his ticket. The harrowed leader rushed to the chief electoral officer challenging the decision, but came back disappointed. Then Swain moved the high court that eventually refused to intervene and referred the matter to the election commission that rejected his appeal.         
	Swain is now reduced to waiting for his next opportunity. Its unfortunate that a politician is forced out of race on mere technical grounds, he rued. The firebrand leader defeated veteran Congress leader J.B. Patnaik from Athgarh Assembly in 2000.         
	Swains BJP colleague from Nilgiri, Pratap Chandra Sarangi, however, was luckier. Though he had failed to submit his ticket while filing for nomination, he filed a fresh set of papers as an Independent. Though he could not contest on his party ticket, he is at least in the electoral race. War-horse and cabinet minister Surendra Nath Naik was forced out of race in a dramatic fashion after he filed his papers with a BJD ticket from Bhubaneswar (north) on April 3 and learnt the next day that his ticket had been withdrawn and given to Bhagirathi Jena.         
	While Naik, who had been elected to Assembly seven times, described the BJD move as a conspiracy, BJD general secretary Narendra Swain explained that Naiks ticket was withdrawn as a decree was issued against his son in a loan default case in which he was the guarantor. Naik, however dismissed the explanation.         
	Besides Naik, the BJD has denied tickets to 16 legislators including cabinet minister Chaitanya Prasad Majhi citing the winnability factor. Other deprived MLAs include Parameswar Sethi, Ajit Hembram, Nagendra Pradhan, Kishor Tarai, Bikram Burma, Dharmananda Behera, Sashi Bhusan Behera, Sarat Paikray, Jyotirindra Nath Mitra, Madhabananda Behera, Ladukishore Swain , Ramesh Chandra Majhi, Saroj Samal and Niladri Nayak.        
	Opposition Congress also denied tickets to veteran leader and three-time chief minister J.B. Patnaik and party MLAs, Tara Parasad Bahinipati, Nimain Sarkar, Purna Chandra Majhi and Rabindra Nath Mallick.         
	While Bahinipati has quit the party and is contesting on a BJP ticket, others are waiting for the next elections.         
	NCP, which had only two members in the Assembly, has denied ticket to party MLA from Kendrapara, Utkal Keshari Parida.         
	BJP, on the other hand, has granted tickets to its sitting MLAs, while CPI and CPM have fielded their lone sitting legislators.

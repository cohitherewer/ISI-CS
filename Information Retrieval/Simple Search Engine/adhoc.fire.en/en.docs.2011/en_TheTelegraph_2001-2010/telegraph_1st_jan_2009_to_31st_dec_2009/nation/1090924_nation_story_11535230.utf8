                                                                                                               Young major dies in Valley shootout
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                              
	Srinagar, Sept. 23: A young army major who had got married just a year ago died in an encounter with militants in a swampy north Kashmir area as gun battles raged in the Valley after months of relative calm.        
	Three other soldiers were killed in the encounters, sources said, while the rebels lost four men, including a Hizb-ul Mujahideen senior commander, Pasha, and Lashkar-e-Toiba militant Musa.        
	Seven soldiers, including two majors, were injured in the clashes in Bandipore and Baramulla districts, the sources added.        
	Police said Major Suresh Suri, of 13 Rashtirya Riffles, died of wounds suffered in a gunfight that broke out yesterday after troops he was leading cordoned off Banyari village in Bandipore district on a tip-off that Pasha and Musa were hiding in a house.        
	The regiment also lost another man, Naik Khushal Singh, who, too, succumbed to injuries.        
	The major and a soldier received gunshot wounds and both later succumbed to their injuries, a source said.        
	The two had planned a blitzkrieg entry through the attic but ran into a spray of bullets as they entered the wooden room.        
	Defence spokesperson Lt Col J.S. Brar said it was a difficult operation as the village, on the banks of Wullar Lake, is surrounded by swamps.         
	The militants knew the area well and we had to be careful to avoid collateral damage, he said.         
	Army sources said Suri, 30, from Hyderabad, had got married just a year ago. He was a brilliant soldier who was also an instructor in junior command and counter-insurgency, the defence spokesperson added.        
	Naik Khushal Singh, 32, from Uttarakhand, is survived by his wife and a two-year-old daughter.        
	Sources said Pasha and Musa gave the forces a tough time as they kept slipping from one house to another. Pasha was the first to be killed this afternoon before the troops cornered Musa and blew up the house he was hiding in.        
	Pasha was a district commander of the Hizb-ul Mujahideen and was carrying an award of Rs 11 lakh on his head, a source said.        
	Police sources said two other majors, Gautam Raj Reshi and Kamlesh Kumar, a non-commissioned officer, Mahipal Singh, and a sepoy, Naveen, were injured in the shootout in Bandipore district, 60km from Srinagar.        
	The toll in another encounter that started on Monday evening in the woods of Baramulla rose today after a marine commando died. One militant was also killed in the exchange of fire.         
	On Monday, one soldier died after militants ambushed a search party in the Ladoo-Panzla forest area, about 40km from district headquarters Baramulla.        
	Baramulla police chief Viplaw Kumar said the dead (in the Baramulla encounter) included two soldiers and two militants while three jawans were injured.         
	One of the slain soldiers is a marine commando, he added.        
	The injured have been shifted to 92 Base hospital in Srinagar.        
	Police sources said the operation at Rafiabad, 90km from Srinagar, was still on as the army suspects some more militants are hiding in the area.        
	Fierce encounters are still going on. We are sure these militants have recently infiltrated from PoK (Pakistan-occupied Kashmir), an army source said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Alliances based   on need: Rahul
                                                                                                               Alliances based   on need: Rahul
          SANJAY K. JHA                           Rahul at a news conference in Chennai. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, Sept. 10: Rahul Gandhi has once again put the Congresss coalition policy in perspective, clearly indicating that alliances will be need-based, situation-specific and not at the cost of partys long-term interests.         
	This will put to rest speculation about the Congress preparing to go alone in the rest of the country after the success of the Uttar Pradesh formula.        
	The idea that the UP concept can be applied universally across the country is a shallow idea, Rahul said in Chennai today.        
	The BJP had generated a lot of noise before the last general election about the collapse of the UPA, warning the existing allies against the Congresss anti-coalition mindset.         
	Rahuls comments today acknowledge the compulsions of the coalition era and reject the concept of a blanket ban on alliances.        
	I think you have to look at every state and look at the dynamics within each state. Each state is different. Uttar Pradesh has a particular balance, a particular politics and we were in discussions with the Samajwadi Party. Once we had assessed all the options, it became clear to us that the better option for us was to fight it alone, the Amethi MP said.        
	He underlined the fact that the Uttar Pradesh experiment, to contest alone, was not impulsive political adventurism but a calculated selection of a better option.        
	Congress leaders viewed the remarks as a measure of Rahuls maturity and recalled that he was not opposed in principle to the alliance with the Samajwadis, but had insisted that his party must protect its interests in any agreement.        
	At the Congress Working Committee meeting that had discussed the issue before the election, Rahul had argued that coalition did not mean abdication of partys role and vacating political space to the dominant partner. He had even advocated a destructive role if the Congress did not get adequate space in coalition.        
	In both Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, the Congress had almost abdicated its political responsibility and survived at the mercy of the dominant partner. While both the Samajwadi Party and the BSP grew at the cost of the Congress in Uttar Pradesh, the Rashtriya Janata Dal did the same in Bihar.        
	The strong presence of the BJP in these states put a premium on Muslim votes and driving the Congress out of the frame became the primary objective of the Samajwadis, the BSP and the RJD.         
	The Congress had to win back this vital space and the process was hastened because of the partys antagonistic relations with both Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mayavati.        
	On the contrary, RJD chief Lalu Prasad maintained good relations with Sonia Gandhi but decimated the Congress in Bihar. Rahuls belief was that reviving the party by risking a few seats was a better option.         
	But this was not the case in Maharashtra, where the state government depended on the NCP for survival. Party leaders feel the continued engagement with Sharad Pawars party is a political imperative.         
	In Tamil Nadu, though, the Congress is in a complimentary role and stands to gain nothing by antagonising both the ADMK and the DMK.        
	In Bengal, the Congress sees Trinamul as a natural ally. The long-term perspective envisages a merger of the two parties.

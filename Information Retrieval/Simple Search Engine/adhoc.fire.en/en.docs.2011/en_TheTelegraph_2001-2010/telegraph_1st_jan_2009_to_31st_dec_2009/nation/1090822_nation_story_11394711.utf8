          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Imphal, Aug. 21: Lured by a militant groups offer of Rs 5,000, a jawan hurled a grenade at people in front of a hospital here this morning.         
	The blast injured five persons, two of them  an eight-year-old girl passing by and a patients relative  seriously.        
	The jawan, T. Munal, a rifleman of the 2nd India Reserve Battalion, who was arrested by police on suspicion of having lobbed the grenade, later confessed to having received the money from the Kangleipak Communist Party (Military Council).         
	He also admitted to having lobbed grenades at people in front of hospitals and clinics twice earlier.        
	Today, the grenade exploded about 20 feet from the main entrance of Chamber Hospital, Medical Care and Research Centre around 6.30am. The site is only 150 metres from the Manipur Assembly.        
	The KCP (MC) had also left a pinless hand grenade at the entrance of the hospital targeted today on August 15 morning. It had stated the next day that the grenade was a warning to the hospital for not complying with its rules and regulations.        
	I was in the operation theatre. The blast shook the hospital. I ran, not knowing where I was heading. Everybody inside the hospital started crying, a nurse said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Temple seize charge on Prachanda 
                                                                                                               Temple seize charge on Prachanda 
          J. HEMANTH AND AGENCIES                          Pashupatinath temple                                  
	Kathmandu, Jan. 4: A key ally in Nepals ruling coalition today alleged that the Maoist-led government was trying to capture Pashupatinath temple by replacing its Indian priests with Nepalese nationals, but the Prime Minister denied this.        
	The appointment of Nepali priests in place of Indians is mere coincidence, said Prachanda.        
	The Prime Minister, a Maoist, said he did not intend to displace the south Indian Bhatta Brahmins who have been conducting the worship of Pashupatinath for nearly three centuries.        
	Foreign minister Upendra Yadav, a leader of the Madhesi Peoples Rights Forum that represents Indian-origin Madhesis, told an Indian news channel: The CPN-Maoists and its cadre are responsible for this attack. This is against Hindus and Hindu sentiments. This is an anti-religious mob and they are trying to capture the Pashupatinath temple to disturb religious activities there.        
	Prachanda claimed he had got the appointments of the Nepali priests approved by the chief patron of the Pashupatinath Area Development Trust (PADT). The member secretary of the PADT was asked to recommend names for the vacant posts and the appointments were done accordingly. As such, no procedures were violated, he said.        
	What the Prime Minister did not say was that the Nepal Supreme Court has ordered a stay on the matter, on an appeal against the removal of the Indian priests, which the government violated.         
	An Indian priest, Ganesh Bhat, today quit after being allegedly threatened by the Maoist youth wing, the Young Communist League.         
	Bishnu Prasad Dahal has been appointed the priest in the main temple and Saligram Dhakal is to conduct worship in the Basuki temple.        
	Prachandas comments came a day after Nepals dethroned king, Gyanendra, appealed to the people not to politicise the dispute.        
	A Gyanendra aide quoted the deposed king as saying: I request and urge the Nepal government, devotees and all others to keep the Lord Pashupatinath temple above politics. Faith, tradition and religious practices are matters closely linked with the right and responsibility of our life and nationalism.         
	Maoist minister Gopal Kirati said the government would allow Nepali priests to conduct worship despite the Supreme Court stay. The minister for culture and state restructuring said he would file a petition against the interim order and not reinstate the sacked Indian priests.        
	Regular worship at the temple has suffered over the past week after junior priests started protesting against the replacement of the Indian chief priest.        
	The pagoda-roofed temple, a world heritage site, draws thousands of pilgrims from Nepal and India every year.

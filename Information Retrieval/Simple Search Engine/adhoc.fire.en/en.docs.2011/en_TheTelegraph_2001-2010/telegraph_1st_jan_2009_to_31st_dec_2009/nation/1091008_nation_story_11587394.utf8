The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | RSS noose tightens around BJP
                                                                                                               RSS noose tightens around BJP
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, Oct. 7: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sanghs (RSS) decision to choose Bihar as the venue for its first karyakari mandal (working committee) conclave, to start from October 9, has raised eyebrows in states political circles.        
	RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and the top brass of the right-wing Hindu outfit have already reached Rajgir, the venue for what the Sangh Parivar mandarins describe as a historic conclave. The three-day conclave will conclude on October 11 and will be attended by over 350 members, including general secretary Bahiyaji Joshi, said RSS spokesman Manmohan Vaidya. The meeting agenda, Vaidya said, would be internal security, terrorism, Naxalite threat and border disputes with China and Pakistan.         
	However, Sangh Parivar sources said that the RSS had chosen Bihar as it also had Bihar-centric agenda. It seems that the outfits top brass believe that the RSS ideology had weakened in Bihar despite the BJP sharing power with Nitish Kumar-led JD(U) in the state.        
	Sources add that the RSS was anxious, as the BJP had allegedly forgotten issues such as infiltration of Bangladeshi nationals into Kishenganj, Katihar, Purnea and Araria despite staying in power with the Nitish government. The infiltration issue, ISI and cow slaughter in seemanchal areas were topics close to BJP heart, before it joined the Nitish-led government.        
	RSS ideologues are apparently not happy with Bihar BJP toeing the line of Nitish and appeasing minorities and escalated ISI activities on the India-Nepal and India-Bangladesh borders.        
	The Rajgir conclave is also being described as a fundamental shift in RSS strategy. RSSs top decision-making body had granted autonomy to the BJP to carrying forward its agenda. The RSS no longer finds the BJP, dogged by indiscipline and infighting, capable to pursue the Sanghs policies, said a source.        
	Bal Apte, Ramlal, V. Satish and Saudan Singh will represent BJP in the conclave, said Vaidya. The RSS has not invited any senior BJP leader from Bihar to participate in the proceedings.        
	The RSS will have separate meetings with the Bihar BJP, said Vaidya, defending the action. He refused to comment on the issue further. RSS sources said the outfit will evolve a formula to tighten the noose around the Bihar BJP.        
	However, a section of BJP ministers and senior party leaders are expected to attend the inaugural session on October 9.         
	But, they will not be a part of the deliberations which will be a close-door affair confined among the RSS top brass, besides Bal Apte, Ramlal and Satish, said the source.        
	Though the Nitish government provided security to the RSS chief on his journey from Patna to Rajgir, the chief minister is believed to be less enthusiastic about RSS choosing Bihar for its conclave.         
	Nitish apparently apprehends that the conclave might prove to be a weapon in the hands of rivals Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan to pillory the NDA government for allowing the anti-minority outfit to spread its tentacles here, a state that has seldom been a comfortable with the right-wing philosophy.

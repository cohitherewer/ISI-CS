                                                                                                               BJP success baffles pollsters
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Raipur, May 17: Psephologists have been taken aback by Chhattisgarh poll results where the BJP made a clean sweep yesterday.         
	For, in the past four months after the government came to power, there were no heavy development activities that could have tilted voters favour towards the BJP, experts believe. However, the fact remains that BJPs vote share increased by a six per cent margin since last time.         
	Chief minister Raman Singh assumed office for his second term on December 12, 2008. A month went in cabinet formation and celebrations of the partys win. In January, the government was busy finalising the annual budget outlay and preparation for the budget session of the Assembly that started in early February.         
	When it was time to start work on development, Election Commission (EC) had already imposed the code of conduct for the general elections (March 2) and the state went to the polls on April 16.        
	The Raman Singh-led government may not have much development work to its credit in the four months since it assumed office in December 2008, however, during this period the ruling BJP did successfully increase its vote bank.         
	If one compares the November 2008 polls results to this years, BJP secured 11 more Assembly constituencies. Opposition Congress, on the other hand, lost 14 seats, while BJP also bagged a lead in 61 Assembly constituencies of the 90 in the Lok Sabha elections.        
	Just four months ago, the BJP had bagged 50 seats and retained power in the state in the November 2008 state polls.         
	On the other hand, Congress performance has dipped further. While the party won 38 seats in the 2008 Assembly poll, it is now confined to 24.         
	BSP, which had two members in the Assembly, failed to maintain that lead.        
	BJPs vote share also changed drastically While the party shared about 39 per cent votes in the Assembly elections, it went up to 45 per cent in the Lok Sabha elections that bestowed 10 of the 11 seats to the BJP.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, Oct. 12: A former IBM engineer deep in debt committed suicide along with his wife and their five-year-old son after harassment at the hands of credit card collection agents, police said.        
	Rama Rao, 35, Neelima, 25, and son Nitish were found hanging in their flat at Dindigul on the citys outskirts last night, hours after the collection agents allegedly took away household items and insulted the family in front of neighbours.        
	A suicide note found in the house mentioned the familys financial problems and the humiliation by the collection agents.         
	Rao had lost his job in June this year and had been hard pressed ever since, said a police official.         
	Police sources linked Raos job problem to the IT slowdown, saying he had left after being demoted with a 30 per cent pay cut. They added, however, that this could be confirmed only after a probe.         
	We are probing with all angles in mind, the official added.         
	Neelima was working in an IT firm in a non-technical position, but her income didnt appear to be enough to pay off the debts and support the family, the police said.        
	At present, though, the inquiry is focusing on the collection agents, who are said to have visited the Raos flat yesterday and caused a ruckus.         
	Relatives of the family, which hailed from Eluru in West Godavari district, said the embarrassment in front of neighbours was too much for the Raos to bear.        
	Other police officers suggested the Raos werent the only ones facing the slowdown heat. According to them, a lot of unemployed IT workers with apartments in the upscale Nizampeta, and Dindigul areas have been selling their houses and even electronic goods to make ends meet.         
	Some have taken to catering, supplying food packets to IT employees in Hitech City, the citys technology nerve-centre.        
	The police have decided to step up vigil in the residential areas of Hitech City, worried that more such suicides by distressed IT workers are possible ahead of Diwali.        
	An IT industry source said nearly 30,000 employees have been removed in Hyderabad in the past two years.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Scientist candidate riled by PMs spoiler tag
                                                                                                               Scientist candidate riled by PMs spoiler tag
          SATISH NANDGAONKAR IN MUMBAI                          Ghosh: Reformer role                                   
	Sailen Ghosh, former Bhabha Atomic Research Centre scientist, believes that Independents like him can do for Manmohan Singh what Jyoti Basu once did for then Bengal chief minister Bidhan Chandra Roy.        
	Namely, show the Prime Minister where he is going wrong.        
	Which is why the candidate from Mumbai South Central is riled by the Prime Ministers advice to Mumbai, during a visit two weeks ago, not to vote for Independents who are spoilers and cannot win.        
	What right does he have to say that? Independent candidates like me are not spoilers; they are reformers. In comparison, party MPs merely toe the line their leaders take. They are dependent, only we are truly independent, Ghosh, 61, said.        
	He explained his point: Once, when Jyoti Basu lost an election, Bidhan Chandra Roy had said he would miss him in the Assembly. If he is not there, who will correct me? Roy had said. The Prime Minister too must remember that only the Independents can tell the mainstream parties where they are going wrong.        
	Ghosh, who retired as head of biotechnology process development at the BARCs food technology division in January, decided to fight the elections after the November terror attacks.        
	After 26/11, Mumbais citizens were angry with politicians and everyone wanted change. I decided I would be that change, he said at his small flat at the BARC staff quarters in Anushakti Nagar.        
	I dont have campaign funds like the political parties have, but I at least expected the media to support me and hear what I have to say. But the media are focusing on the same party candidates they wanted out five months ago.        
	Ghosh said an NGO had wanted to field Hemant Karkares wife Kavita from Mumbai South Central but she declined at the last moment.        
	If she had contested, I would not have filed my nomination. Now, they (the NGO) have promised to support me. I have support from government officials, but service rules dont allow them to campaign for me.        
	The former researcher has visited some areas in his constituency with his wife and attended a few meet the candidate programmes organised by the NGO, but his campaign has largely been confined to emails, blogs and phone calls.        
	He says that ironically, it was something the Prime Minister had said during a visit to the BARC four years ago that inspired him to implement an idea mentioned in his eight-point manifesto. If elected, he wants to create a model for senior citizens homes, called Tapovan.        
	Singh had awarded some retired staff (at the BARC), and on learning that senior citizens were leading scattered lives, suggested they should live and work together for society. That was how I thought of developing a model like Tapovan, which can be implemented in every constituency, Ghosh said.        
	The former scientist  who has served on the Union environment and forests ministrys infrastructure development committee and set up the All India Department of Atomic Energy Officers Association  also wants the research-and-development infrastructure in the country overhauled.        
	Scientific bodies should be made accountable. Homi Bhabha always said that over the years, R amp;D should stop using government funds and generate wealth for the nation. But 60 years after Independence, our scientific bodies are still government-funded.        
	He cites the example of Bengals arsenic problem. No solution has been found even after so many years. If they cant find a solution, why are the scientists there? If the Bengal chief minister tells the Prime Minister he wants a solution within six months, and the message goes out to the scientists that be accountable or perish, there could be a solution. Look at how Israel has found agricultural solutions in the desert, Ghosh said.        
	Ghosh is pitted against the sitting MP from the Congress, Eknath Gaikwad, and Shiv Sena MLA Suresh Gambhir. More than half the 14.9 lakh voters in the constituency, which includes Dharavi, live in slums.        
	He knows he cannot compete against the political apparatus of his opponents, but says that a defeat for him would be a loss for Mumbai. If I lose, it is the voice of Mumbai that loses  the voice that wanted change.              
	 Mumbai South Central voted on April 30

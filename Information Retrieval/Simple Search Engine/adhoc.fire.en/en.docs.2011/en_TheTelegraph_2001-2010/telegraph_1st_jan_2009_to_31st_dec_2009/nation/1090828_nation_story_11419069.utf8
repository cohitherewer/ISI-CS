          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 27: A rapid analysis of 30 deaths from pandemic flu in India suggests most of the patients who died reported for treatment in a severe condition, about five days after symptoms began, senior health officials said today.         
	India has recorded 3,396 laboratory-confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus and 78 infected people have died in seven states. Medical experts have expressed concern at the lack of investigations into the circumstances of the deaths.         
	Government health officials said today that investigations of flu fatalities were under way and a preliminary analysis indicated that the patients who died had developed viral pneumonia  with cough and breathlness as the main symptoms.         
	In most cases that we have examined, patients arrived late for treatment  about five days late, said Rakesh Srivastava, director-general of health services. Patients moved from one private clinic to another before seeking treatment  this should not happen. The focus should be on early detection and recognition and treatment of severe cases, he said.         
	The government has sent stocks of the antiviral oseltamivir to handle up to 10,000 patients in each of the six metropolitan cities  Calcutta, Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, and Hyderabad  and up to 1,000 patients in each of 35 towns.         
	Fifteen private laboratories have been certified by the government as capable of performing the diagnostic test for the H1N1 virus  four in Delhi, nine in Tamil Nadu, and two in Karnataka.         
	The entry of private laboratories in flu diagnosis is expected to ease the strain on government laboratories. But private laboratories will charge for the tests, unlike government laboratories where diagnosis is free.

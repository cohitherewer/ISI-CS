          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Nov. 7: An IAS officer who had launched a crusade against corruption in the bureaucracy sprang a surprise today by disclosing his assets, days after judges of the Supreme Court did so.        
	Vijay Shanker Pandey, a 1979 batch officer, was joined by three others in what is the first attempt at bureaucratic transparency in the country: colleagues Sunil Kumar and Renuka Chaudhary and IPS officer Jasbeer Singh.         
	Pandey is at present additional cabinet secretary and principal secretary (information) in the secretariat of chief minister Mayavati.         
	Chaudhary and her husband Sunil Kumar, who are from the Uttar Pradesh cadre, are on central deputation now.        
	Singh, posted as deputy inspector-general (training) in the state, had shot into the spotlight in the nineties when he publicly termed feudal lord-turned-politician Raja Bhaiya as one of Indias Most Wanted.        
	The officers have sent out their declarations to the cabinet secretary and asked for their assets to be put up on the website of the personnel ministry.         
	Pandey, who, as president of the state IAS association in 1997, had launched a campaign against the most corrupt bureaucrats of Uttar Pradesh, said he wanted to start this healthy practice which is in the larger interest of ensuring transparency in the bureaucracy.        
	We have written letters to the central cabinet secretary and have demanded that all public servants, whether a government officer or political leader, should disclose their moveable and immovable assets, PTI quoted the officer as saying.        
	Pandey hoped his colleagues would come forward and do the same and called for an arrangement that would help public servants disclose their assets.         
	The move caught bureaucrats in Uttar Pradesh by surprise. This may be the beginning of a process for other bureaucrats across the country to volunteer information about the assets held by them and their immediate families, said an IAS officer, who did not wish to be named.         
	So how much is Pandey worth? The officer said he has Rs 1.17 lakh in a bank account and Rs 2.5 lakh in post office deposits. Besides, he owns a 1990 model car.        
	Details of the assets of the other three officers could not be ascertained.        
	The officers move comes weeks after Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan and 20 other Supreme Court judges voluntarily declared their assets.

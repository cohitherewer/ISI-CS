          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, June 24: A 25-year-old answered a knock on the door last evening to find three of her husbands estranged cousins who barged in and took turns to rape her, according to a police complaint filed by the victim.        
	The assault, the ninth alleged violation of a young woman in the capital this month, came barely a day after a 24-year-old complained that she had been gangraped by five policemen in a police station.        
	Police officials probing yesterdays incident said the woman, Smita (name changed), had said in her FIR that she and her husband had separated from their joint family in Bulandshahr and come to stay in Farsh Bazaar, east Delhi, some time back.        
	At Bulandshahr, her husband Jaswant had a longstanding feud with his parental uncles three sons  Subhash, Rakesh and Mukesh  over some money matters. On Tuesday evening, when her husband was out for work, the three, all in their mid-20s, arrived at her house without any prior intimation, at about 6.30pm. She was surprised to see them but let them in, nevertheless, said an official of Farsh Bazar police station.        
	They then started asking for Jaswant and demanded their money back. When she told them that her husband was not at home and she could not give them any money, they raped her in front of her three-year-old son and left. They also threatened her with dire consequences if she revealed anything.        
	When the womans husband came back around 10, he found her crying on the terrace. When she told me what had happened, I called the cops, he said.        
	Smita was then taken to Guru Tegh Bahadur hospital where a medical examination confirmed rape. Police sources said a case had been registered and a hunt was on for the three men.        
	The incident came barely weeks after Delhi police chief Y.S. Dadwal claimed that there had been a drop in women-related crimes in the capital.        
	The officer, whose two-year term ends on July 25, had said that while rape cases had fallen by 17 per cent compared with last year, molestation cases had come down by 32 per cent.        
	About the complaint against the five policemen accused of rape, the crime branch said it would not immediately arrest the main accused, former station house officer Pradeep Kumar of Inderpuri police station, until discrepancies in the alleged victims statements were scrutinised.         
	Sources said investigations had not yet been able to establish the events leading to the alleged rape.        
	The sources also said that investigators had evidence to prove that the woman was not on the police station premises at the time she claimed the rape took place.         
	The evidence, according to police officials, had been sourced through footage from CCTV cameras installed in the station.

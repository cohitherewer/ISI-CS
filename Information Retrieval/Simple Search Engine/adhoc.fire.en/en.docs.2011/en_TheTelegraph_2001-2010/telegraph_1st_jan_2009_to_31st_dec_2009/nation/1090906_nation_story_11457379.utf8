The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rosaiah packs punch in Jagan praise
                                                                                                               Rosaiah packs punch in Jagan praise
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                          K Rosaiah                                  
	Hyderabad, Sept. 5: The son has many qualities of his father, but is too young to lead, interim Andhra Pradesh chief minister K. Rosaiah said today.        
	The statement appeared to be a carefully crafted reply to the concerted campaign for elevating Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddys son Jaganmohan amid indications that the Congress high command had frowned on the open jockeying for the 36-year-old.        
	Union minister and party in-charge of Andhra affairs M. Veerappa Moily is understood to have told Jagan loyalists to defer their campaign till the weeklong mourning for the late leader was over.        
	Rosaiah struck soon after, seeking to nip the coronation clamour for Jagan when he told a television channel that YSRs son was very young to head the state.        
	Jagan is very young but has many qualities of his father, the 77-year-old veteran said. (But) the high command will think in different angles before taking final stock of the situation.        
	The interim chief ministers comments came a day after all 35 members of Rajasekhar Reddys cabinet, including Rosaiah, and over 120 of the 156 party MLAs had signed a memorandum appealing for Jagans appointment.                        Jaganmohan Reddy      
	Highly placed sources said the high command could persist with Rosaiah as an interim arrangement for a few months till elections were over in Maharashtra, Arunachal Pradesh and Haryana next month.        
	As Jagan is an MP, the high command, the sources added, could ask him to get elected from Pulivendula, his fathers Assembly seat.        
	The sources said this would help the leadership delay a decision and avoid friction in the state.        
	Other sources hinted that the young MP could be accommodated in the central cabinet, which would also help avert a face-off with the pro-Jagan group.        
	Some senior Congress leaders are said to have objected to comparing Jagan with Rajiv Gandhi, who became Prime Minister after Indira Gandhis assassination in 1984.        
	One cannot compare Jagan with Rajiv Gandhi. Rajiv earned the peoples support because of the sacrifices made by his family for the nation, Rajya Sabha MP V. Hanumantha Rao said.        
	Rosaiahs comments to the television channel came hours after Hanumantha Raos remarks.        
	Rosaiah has already sent to the high command for approval the names of all those who were in the YSR cabinet as a fresh council has to be sworn in. Legal experts said the members would have to take oath afresh.         
	An attempt to hold an impromptu meeting of the legislature party and pass a resolution in favour of Jagan was thwarted at the last minute by the high command, and the organisers had to convert the meeting into a padayatra (march) and a memorial gathering.        
	We are not going to do it (choose a new chief minister) during the mourning period, PTI quoted Congress central leader Moily as saying. Let the mourning period be over. Then we will apply our mind. Till that time we are not going to apply our mind on the successor.        
	While YSRs funeral took place at his family estate in Pulivendula, his admirers held similar rituals in at least 16 places across the state.        
	Portraits of the late chief minister, who died in a helicopter crash on Wednesday, were taken out in processions in places like Karimnagar, Warangal, Rajahmundry, Srikakulam and Vizianagaram and later buried.

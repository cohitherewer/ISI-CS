          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 3: The Supreme Court today ticked off students for focusing more on politics than on studies.        
	Are you studying or contesting elections and litigating? a three-judge bench wondered while hearing a petition filed by two students against the Delhi University election officers decision to disqualify them from contesting in polls scheduled tomorrow.        
	The apex court refused to overturn the decision to disallow the two for alleged violation of the Lyngdoh committee guidelines, saying students these days deserved no sympathy.        
	Deepak Negi and Umesh Tanwar had filed nominations for the posts of president and vice-president, respectively.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Dibrugarh, Oct. 4: The Congress-Trinamul spat in Bengal is resonating in far-off Arunachal Pradesh, with clashes occurring in an Assembly constituency where their candidates are rivals.        
	Curfew has been clamped in Tezu amid three days of violence and tension, with attacks on the Congress candidates home, a police station and a market after an alleged Trinamul supporter was beaten up for tearing Congress posters. Over 50 people, including police personnel, have been injured.        
	The Bengal Congress, which recently formed the civic board in Siliguri with Left support, has been accusing Trinamul of creating the rift by fielding nine Congress dissidents for the October 13 Arunachal polls.        
	Most of the violence between the UPA allies took place yesterday while Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was campaigning 150km away in Pasighat.        
	The trouble began on Friday in Tezu, where sitting Congress MLA Kariko Kri is pitted against Trinamuls Nakul Chi, a fellow member of the dominant Mishimi tribe. Kri, returning from his campaign rally, noticed a man tearing up party posters.        
	The Congress MLAs supporters caught hold of the man, who turned out to be a Trinamul supporter, and beat him up, Lohit district superintendent of police (SP) Issac Pertin said over the phone.        
	After the news spread across the town on Saturday, 150-odd Trinamul workers and supporters, armed with sticks, sharp weapons and stones, laid siege to Tezu sadar police station around 3pm. They ransacked nearby shops and beat up traders before the police beat them back.        
	Curfew was clamped and deputy commissioner Kaling Tayeng met representatives of all political parties in his office. Around this time, Trinamul supporters attacked Kris home, damaging a portion of the house and a few vehicles.        
	We had to fire in the air. A few policemen received minor injuries, SP Pertin said.        
	Curfew was re-imposed in Tezu this afternoon after a six-hour relaxation in the morning, and the army staged a flag march. The police have so far arrested four people, all Trinamul workers.Trinamul is contesting 26 of the 60 seats after Mamata Banerjee gave tickets to nine Congress dissidents who were refused nomination by Pranab Mukherjee. The Congress is contesting all the 60 seats.

                                                                                                               Heat and blast mar elections
                            
	April 23 (Agencies): Maoist rebels detonated a landmine in Bihars Muzaffarpur district, killing at least two policemen escorting a vehicle packed with voting machines after polling as the second round of Election 2009 ended on a bloody note.        
	The heat also exacted its toll as two poll officials died of sunstroke in Orissa on a day some 10 crore people voted in 140 Lok Sabha segments across 12 states. Election officials said at least 55 per cent voters cast their ballot in this round  the biggest of the five-phase election.        
	Block development officer Mohammed Kabir said the Maoists detonated the mine at a culvert. We have information that two policemen have been killed.        
	No major violence had, however, been reported during voting during the day barring stray rebel attacks in Jharkhand and Bihar.        
	In Rahul Gandhis constituency Amethi, the turnout was 40 per cent, initial reports said, lower than the 44.4 per cent in 2004. Sister Priyanka blamed it on the heat and denied voters were unhappy with Rahul. But she accepted there was a problem in Bahadurpur village, where many had refused to vote. They have asked me to come to the village after the election, she said.         
	In Kashmir, Hurriyat moderates asked people to stay away from the polls, less than a week after deciding not to call a boycott.

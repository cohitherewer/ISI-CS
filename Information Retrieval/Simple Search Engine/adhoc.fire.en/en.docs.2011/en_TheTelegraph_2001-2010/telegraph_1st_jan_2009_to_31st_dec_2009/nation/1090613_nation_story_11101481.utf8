          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 12: Inordinate delay in revision of the BPL list sparked an uproar in the Assembly today with the Opposition demanding immediate publication of the same.        
	Opposition chief whip Prasad Harichandan complained that the list that was identified in 1997 was still in force and that the government was yet to finalise a revised list prepared in 2002. As a result of which lakhs of families were being deprived of benefits such as subsidised rice, free treatment, houses under Indira Awas Yojana and old-age pension.        
	Harichandan, a former minister, alleged that 7 lakh senior citizens were being deprived from the Centres Indira Gandhi National Old-age Pension Scheme, as the government had failed to send the finalised BPL list.        
	Afterwards an agitated Opposition demanded the immediate publication of the revised list in the current session of the Assembly. Senior Congress member Anup Sai urged the Speaker to direct the government to publish a revised list within a specific deadline.        
	Responding to the demand, panchayati raj minister Prafulla Samal assured that the 2002 BPL list would be updated soon and the deadline would be announced during the current session. Explaining the reason for the delay in finalisation, the minister said that though 41.56 lakh families were identified in a survey, Union rural development ministry allowed the state to include 38 lakh households, as a result of which 3.56 lakh families were left out.        
	The government had, therefore, requested the Centre to revise the number of households from 38 lakh to 41.56 lakh, a request that the Centre was yet to accept.

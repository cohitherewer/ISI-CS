The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | India to miss New Year US nuclear gift
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      India to miss New Year US nuclear gift
          K.P. NAYAR                               Manmohan Singh, Barack Obama				                                 
	Washington, Dec. 17: Barack Obamas good wishes to Manmohan Singh for 2010 will not be accompanied by the New Year gift which the US President had hoped to send to the Prime Minister in the form of a nuclear deal, completed and ready to be put into operation.        
	Elements within the Obama administration opposed to the principles behind the nuclear deal, although unable to stop it or roll it back, have managed to delay a round of talks that would have led to the finalisation of a bilateral agreement for the reprocessing of spent US nuclear fuel by India, which is the next step towards operationalising the controversial deal.         
	The delay is embarrassing for the Prime Minister, who had declared at his news conference in Washington at the end of a state visit on November 25 that I am confident that in the next couple of weeks we can sort out these things and complete the deal.         
	National security adviser M.K. Narayanan had elaborated on the Prime Ministers remark in Port of Spain three days later and told reporters that it is almost done. The difficulty is in the legalese. It can take up to a week, it could take a little longer.        
	But foreign secretary Nirupama Rao said in New Delhi yesterday that the next round of talks has not been scheduled as yet. It will be done shortly. We hope to finalise the agreement at the earliest.        
	Following the public announcements of a deadline by the Prime Minister and his national security adviser, it is understood that India approached the US state department for immediate dates for a round of talks to resolve sticking points which were holding up the agreement.         
	Aware that Obama was keen to fulfil his commitment to Singh that he would stand by the nuclear deal finalised between the Prime Minister and former US President George W. Bush as it is without any changes, state department officials were at their sweet best in responding to the Indian request.        
	But elements within the department, working in concert with others in the administration and the US Congress who are firmly opposed to even minor adjustments in the existing global non-proliferation regime, decided to resort to that time-honoured tool of bureaucrats that is used to thwart the will of their political bosses: delay, delay.        
	The Americans told their Indian interlocutors of the difficulty in persuading negotiators from Washington to travel half way round the globe to India for a nuclear dialogue around Christmas time, which is sacred family time here.        
	And then, there are the New Year holidays soon after, they pleaded.         
	The Indians said of course, and showed sensitivity to the plight of any hapless American who would be asked to be away from stateside during the Christmas and New Year season.         
	Then they offered to send an Indian delegation to Washington, instead, so that the Americans would not be inconvenienced. The real aim of the Indian interlocutors, though, was to salvage the Prime Ministers public commitment in Washington that in the next couple of weeks, the stalemate would be resolved.         
	No, the officials of the state department firmly told the Indians at this stage. Nothing doing. We will see in the new year, was their reply.         
	And to make sure that the Indians do not pile more pressure and twist the arms of the Obama administration, these elements, which want to delay the nuclear deal  if they cannot stop it  persuaded the state department to take a public position on this issue, just as the Prime Minister and his national security adviser did.         
	The state department spokesperson was made to say at his daily briefing that the US and India continue to negotiate reprocessing arrangements and procedures as provided for by Article 6 (iii) of the US-India Nuclear Cooperation Agreement.        
	He then added that the President (Obama) and Prime Minister Singh discussed their mutual commitment to implementing the US-India Civil Nuclear Cooperation Initiative. In this connection, the United States is confident that the arrangements and procedures will be concluded well in advance of the August 2010 deadline.        
	In language that will be well understood by those familiar with the clauses of the nuclear deal, the spokesperson was telling India: Dont rush things. We have our time-table. We will do things at our pace, in our time. Yesterday, the foreign secretary conceded the US argument. She said: I am talking about the agreement on arrangements and procedures  and it will certainly be within the timelines of the bilateral agreement on civil nuclear energy. The agreement basically provides for these talks to conclude within one year, basically before July 2010.        
	On February 3, then foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon wrote to the US under secretary of state for political affairs, William Burns, asking for reprocessing talks to start under the terms of the nuclear deal.         
	The US had six months to start the talks and the state department took its own time to do so, but stuck to the terms of the deal. Now, they have time until August 2010 under the deal to complete the negotiations and sign a reprocessing agreement.         
	By waiting until this deadline and not hurrying with the talks, hardcore non-proliferationists within the Obama administration hope to watch how India behaves in the run up to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) review conference next year as part of their firm belief that New Delhi ought to sign the NPT, although they are probably aware that this will not happen.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Andhra blow to Congress
                                                                                                               Andhra blow to Congress
                            
	Hyderabad, March 8 (PTI): The alliance of the TDP, TRS, CPI and CPM got a boost with the Madiga Reservation Porata Samiti (MRPS) deciding to join it in Andhra Pradesh.        
	This is a blow to the Congress, which could lose the crucial support of the predominant Scheduled Caste group, the Madigas, in the state.        
	MRPS chief Manda Krishna Madiga today said his party would support the alliance to defeat the Congress. The MRPS, which represents the Madigas, was unhappy with the Congress for failing to bring a law for classification of SCs into sub-categories.

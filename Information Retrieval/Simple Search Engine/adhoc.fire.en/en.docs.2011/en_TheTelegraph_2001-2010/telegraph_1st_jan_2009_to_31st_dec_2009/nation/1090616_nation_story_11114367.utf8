          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, June 15: The more than a decade-old anti-liquor movement at Raghunathpur in Jagatsinghpur has gained fresh momentum following the excise departments decision to open an Indian Manufactured Foreign Liquor (IMFL) shop in the area.        
	Residents of Raghunathur, who till date have managed to foil attempts by the state to start an IMFL outlet in the area, are up in arms again against the administrations fresh bid.        
	Led by Nishamukti Abhijan Committee, a citizens panel, residents have threatened to intensify their movement if the administration goes ahead with its decision.         
	Authorities, on the other hand, said that the proposed shop at Ragunathpur is among the nine IMFL outlets and seven country liquor outlets approved for district as a part of the states attempt to generate revenue.        
	Such certified liquor outlets would check the sale of illegal liquor in the rural pockets of Jagatsinghpur. Such illicit trade results in loss of revenue for the state, said Natabar Behera, the excise superintendent for Jagatsinghpur.        
	The residents have complained that there have been no liquor shops in Raghunathpur in the past.         
	They added that the concept of a liquor shop would be opposed by one and all.         
	The residents also believe that the peace and harmony of Raghunathpur would be harmed by the absence of a liquor shop.        
	The administration, in its past attempt in 1996, had tried to open an IMFL outlet at Jagannathpur under Ranghunathpur police station area.        
	But, it was closed after the public complained and began an agitation that was led by Nishamukti Abhijan Committee. Two other unsuccessful attempts were made in 1988 and 1989.        
	We are prepared to continue our battle against any liquor shops in the area and will intensify our protests, if the administration goes against our demand, warned an activist of Nishamukti Abhijan Committee.

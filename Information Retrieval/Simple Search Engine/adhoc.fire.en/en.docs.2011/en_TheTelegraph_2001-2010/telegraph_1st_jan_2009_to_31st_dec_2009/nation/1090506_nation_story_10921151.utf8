          OUR BUREAU                              
	May 5: Repoll in Malkangiri today was marred by an exchange of fire between Maoists and central paramilitary forces at Bhejangiwada.         
	Polling was disrupted at five booths at Bhejangwada under Malkangiri Assembly segment for about an hour due to the gun battle, Malkangiri superintendent of police Satyabrata Bhoi told The Telegraph over phone. The police chief said Maoists began firing at 9.30am near Bhejangwada polling station. However, they fled into the nearby dense forests after CRPF personnel returned fire. No untoward incidents were reported from the other 12 booths in Malkangiri, said district collector Nitin Bhanudas Jawale. A low turn out of 26 per cent was reported in the district till 3pm, said the collector, adding that data of three more booths were awaited.         
	Repolling was held in 17 booths under Malkangiri and Chitrakonda Assembly segments as the first pahse of polling was disrupted on April 16 due to a rebel attack.         
	Bhoi said choppers belonging to Indian Air Force and Border Security Force were pressed into service, while 1,100 CRPF personnel were deployed.         
	Polling was disrupted at Nimasahi booth under Barabati-Cuttack Assembly segment in Cuttack city due to clashes among cadres of BJD, BJP and Congress. Police had to resort to a mildlathi charge to disperse the warring groups.        
	No voter turned up to cast their vote in Mantriamba polling booth in Koraput district, apparently to protest against the lack of development in the area. However, repoll in six other polling stations in Nayagarh and Koraput was peaceful, said a senior official in the chief electoral officers office here. Around 65 per cent voters cast their votes in Nayagarh and 60 per cent at Cuttack, said the official.         
	In a related incident, polling for panchayat election was also held in Dhinkia gram panchayat, the epicentre of anti-Posco agitation.        
	The polling was held after two years. It could not be conducted with the rest of the state on February 21, 2007, due to wide-spread violence by anti-Posco agitators.        
	Jagatsinghpur collector P.K. Meherda said polling was peaceful though there was apprehension about clash between the anti-Posco protestors and the plant supporters. Six platoons of armed police forces were deployed to maintain law and order, said Jagatsinghpur superintendent of police R.K. Sharma.

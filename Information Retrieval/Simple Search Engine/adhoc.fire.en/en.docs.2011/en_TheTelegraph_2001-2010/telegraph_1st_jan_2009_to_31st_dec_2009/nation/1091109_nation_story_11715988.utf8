          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Guwahati, Nov. 8: Delhi and Dhaka have struck a tacit deal under which Bangladesh will not arrest Northeast rebels hiding in that country but secretly hand them over to India, a top home ministry official told The Telegraph today.        
	This will be the trend from now, the source said from Delhi four days after Dhaka quietly handed over Ulfa finance secretary Chitrabon Hazarika and foreign secretary Sasha Choudhury to the BSF on the Tripura border.        
	With top Ulfa leaders such as chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa, commander-in-chief Paresh Barua and his deputy Raju Barua believed to be in Bangladesh, Delhi expects more such unofficial handovers.        
	We now have an understanding that Bangladesh will not arrest any (Indian) militant in that country. They will simply detain them and hand them over to us in the manner most suited at the time, the official said.        
	The formality of arrest has stood in the way of India getting custody of the militants because Dhaka and Delhi do not have an extradition treaty.        
	Once someone is arrested, the extradition treaty comes into play but at this moment we do not have one. That is why India has not been able to pursue the handover of Ulfa general secretary Anup Chetia who was arrested way back in 1997, the source said.        
	The recent understanding has been helped by the installation of a friendly government in Dhaka, led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed, the official said. The previous Prime Minister, Khaleda Zia, had once described Ulfa cadres as freedom fighters and pledged to support them.        
	Some Indian sources, however, have been more circumspect over the past few days, suggesting that Hasinas scheduled India trip next month could be the immediate reason for the handover of Choudhury and Hazarika.        
	The home ministry official said that after Hasinas Awami League returned to power last December, India had opened diplomatic channels seeking visible action against the Northeast rebels, especially Ulfa and the Ranjan Daimary faction of the National Democratic Front of Boroland.        
	Once the understanding was reached, the Bangladesh government started looking for the rebels, most of whom have assumed Muslim names and have started businesses, the official said.        
	Hazarika called himself Ashfaqul Hossein, and Choudhury had adopted the name Rafiqul Islam. Both were picked up from a house in Dhaka on the night of November 1 and detained before being passed on to India.        
	Officially, there is no mention of any detention in Dhaka, and Bangladesh can safely say that its government had nothing to do with the capture of the two Ulfa leaders, the official said.        
	After their handover on Wednesday, the duo were held at the BSFs Gokulnagar camp. They were produced in a Guwahati court on Saturday, and are now in 10 days police remand.        
	Political will is the deciding factor. As long as we have the co-operation of the Bangladesh government, such actions will continue to take place, the official said.        
	He added: Rajkhowa and Barua are definitely in Bangladesh. They are not in a position to shift base. They are deeply embedded there because of their business interests.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitish opposes bill for babus
                                                                                                               Nitish opposes bill for babus
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, June 9: Nitish Kumar may object to the Centres reported move to insulate the civil services from the states political establishments, but the Prime Minister has the chief ministers support when it comes to the former opting for a Bihar model on the womens quota bill.         
	The Centre is reportedly readying a Civil Services Bill-2009 that aims to loosen the state governments control over IAS and IPS cadre and empowers Parliament to scrutinise bureaucratic appointments, transfers and postings.         
	I have not seen the draft yet, but I will oppose any move that dilutes a governments authority on civil servants, said the chief minister. State governments are elected by the people and as such should have authority over civil servants working in their respective jurisdictions.        
	While talking of the womens bill it was a more mellow Nitish Kumar who put in a good word for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and thanked him for lending credence to the Bihar model of the womens bill. Bihar was the first state to have introduced a quota for women in local bodies.         
	Though the chief minister did not immediately react to the Prime Ministers Bihar reference in his thanksgiving speech in the Lok Sabha today, sources close to Nitish revealed that he was pleased by it. The PM today said that special priority would be granted to Bihar. The Prime Ministers reference is also being interpreted as Congresss ongoing plan to keep the chief minister happy. After all, the JD(U) alone has 20 MPs in the Lok Sabha. However, the Manmohan Singh ministry has no representation from Bihar so far.         
	Having ministers from Bihar in the Union government is no guarantee of a states development, Nitish said, adding: Our people voted for development by defeating those who were obstacles in the path to progress.

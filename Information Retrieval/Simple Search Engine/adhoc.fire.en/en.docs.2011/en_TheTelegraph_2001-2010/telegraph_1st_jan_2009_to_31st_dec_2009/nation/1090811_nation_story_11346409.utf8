The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Maoists impeding India ties: Nepal
                                                                                                               Maoists impeding India ties: Nepal
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR       
	New Delhi, Aug. 10: Nepali foreign minister Sujata Koirala has said that her countrys Maoists have become an impediment to improving ties with India.        
	They have created an atmosphere in which even Nepali nationalists, senior leaders of the Nepali Congress like (former Prime Minister) G.P. Koirala and me hesitate to talk freely about having good relations with India, Koirala told The Telegraph today. This tactic might be serving the narrow political interests of Maoists but it is not good for the region and for Indo-Nepal relations.         
	Koirala arrived here on a four-day trip today to lay the groundwork for Prime Minister Madhav Nepals India visit starting on August 18. Apart from her counterpart, S.M. Krishna, Koirala will also meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, defence minister A.K. Antony and commerce minister Anand Sharma during her official stay.        
	India is our closest neighbour in every sense and we want to restore the good ties that we have always had, Koirala said. But of late, there has been a lot of anti-India sentiment whipped up in Nepal, almost to the degree that we have to politically fight it out. Poor ties with India and mutual suspicion is not helpful to anyone.        
	Koiralas broadside comes at a time Maoist sentiment in relation to India lies freshly inflamed. All of last fortnight, Maoists have been alleging that the Madhav Nepal government had entered into a secret deal for resuming arms supplies to the Nepal Army.        
	Any resumption of arms supplies  lethal or non-lethal  constitutes a violation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, which became the political basis for the Maoists giving up guerrilla war and joining the mainstream.        
	Even though Prime Minister Madhav Nepal has officially denied any move to have supplies from India resumed, Maoist spokespersons have persisted in alleging a covert deal, which they see as a move to strengthen the hands of the army in preparation for a forced disbanding of the Maoist Peoples Liberation Army (PLA), currently in UN-monitored barracks.        
	Nepali defence minister Bidhya Bhandaris recent visit to India served to bolster Maoist allegations that the army was being covertly armed with Indian help to neutralise the PLA. (Under the terms of the agreement, PLA cadres are to be absorbed into the national army.)        
	The row over Nepal seeking resumption of arms from India wasnt helped by defence minister Bhandaris statements that the Nepal Army was in need of arms and ammunition for training purposes and that she had approached the Indian government for help to ensure that the army does not have to compromise on training requirements.        
	Koiralas attack on Maoists could fetch another angry backlash from the former guerrillas who blamed their own ouster from the government in May and the accession of the Madhav Nepal-led dispensation on an India-aided conspiracy.        
	Maoist ideologue and former finance minister Baburam Bhattarai has demanded that New Delhi stop supporting and co-operating with the current government if it wants democracy to prosper in Nepal.        
	India is a great democracy, but it has worked to destabilise the democratically elected Maoist government in Nepal and promoted a government led by defeated, status quoist and pro-monarchist forces in Kathmandu, Bhattarai had said in an exclusive interview in June. Support to this government must end if India wants democracy to prosper in Nepal.        
	The Maoists have stalled the peace process in Nepal since Prachanda resigned and have forced the Madhav Nepal government into limbo by refusing to participate in the Constituent Assembly.        
	Koirala blamed the Maoists for resorting to anti-democratic methods to disrupt the peace process, which envisages, for a start, the finalisation of a new republican-democratic constitution for Nepal by next year.The Maoists are not participating in the parliamentary process, they are looking for excuses to take to the streets, they are the ones who do not seem to want a democracy prosper in our country, Koirala said.        
	 She added, though, that efforts were on to get the Maoists on board and the task of drafting an agreed constitution back on track. We have recently formed a high-level all party committee and Prachanda has promised to join it. If that happens, we will probably have a body that will be able to sort out inter-party differences on major issues more smoothly. But the Maoists have to co-operate, they have to realise that we cannot betray the peace process by creating a situation of anarchy in the country, Koirala said.

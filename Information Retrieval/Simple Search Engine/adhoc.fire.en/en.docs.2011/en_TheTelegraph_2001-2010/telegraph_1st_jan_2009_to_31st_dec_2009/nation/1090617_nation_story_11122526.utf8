          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Ahmedabad, June 16: A man driven to desperation by debt killed his mother, wife and 12-year-old son and then hanged himself early this morning in Ahmedabad.        
	Minutes before going on his killing spree, computer seller Avinash Patel had sent a text-message to elder brother Bhavesh Patel in the US, saying: We all are going to die very soon.        
	The 38-year-olds two-page suicide note said he had lost Rs 45 lakh in the stock market, and that he feared there would be nobody to look after his family once he had taken his own life.        
	Around 1am, Avinash left his flat and went to his 65-year-old mothers home, where she lived alone, a short distance away. He hit Hansaben on her head with a stick and then slit her wrists with a blade, police said.        
	Avinash then returned to his flat in Pritamnagar and strangled Mona, 32, and schoolboy Shyamal.        
	By then, Bhavesh had called a friend, Nilesh, in Ahmedabad to find out if his brother was in any sort of trouble. Nilesh, who had duplicate keys to the flat, let himself in around 4am to find all three occupants dead, the police said.        
	Mona and Shyamal lay on the bed and Avinash was hanging from the ceiling fan. Nilesh informed the police around 5am.        
	Police sources said that Avinash had also borrowed about Rs 25 lakh from his friends and was repaying them in monthly instalments of Rs 45,000. He apparently lived far beyond his means.

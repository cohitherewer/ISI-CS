	 New Delhi, Nov. 2: The Centre has warned Calcutta, Bangalore, Mumbai and Gujarat police of a possible terror attack from the sea.           
	Sources said the advisory, issued by the home ministry last week came soon after the arrest of Lashkar-e-Toiba operative David Coleman Headley by the FBI at Chicago airport late last month.           
	Calcutta has always been on the radar of terrorists who have a well-entrenched network of operatives in Bangladesh.           
	Security agencies feel terror outfits will not miss an opportunity to carry out another attack since there has been no strike after 26/11.           
	Although work on building coastal security capabilities has moved quickly, the job is far from complete.                   
	 Riyadh(PTI): India and Saudi Arabia have decided to issue multiple-entry visas to businessmen in a bid to overcome regulatory hurdles blocking the growth of two-way trade. Adnan A. Al-Nueim, secretary-general of the Asharqia Chamber, said Saudi Arabias trade ties with India would grow further with the reciprocal visits.                  
	 Ballia (PTI): Two pilgrims were killed and six others injured when their jeep collided with a tractor in Uttar Pradeshs Ballia district on Monday. The pilgrims were going for a holy dip in the Ganga on the occasion of Kartik Purnima.                  
	 Bangalore (PTI): A security guard at a Bank of India ATM has been arrested on the charge of murdering a colleague. Gyanendra, 20, had shot dead Mohan Raj before trying to rob the bank. Gyanendra, who was arrested from Madhya Pradesh, was unsuccessful in his attempt to carry out the bank robbery.                  
	 Kochi (PTI): A Kerala High Court judge resigned on Monday citing personal reasons. Justice V. Giri, 49, who became a permanent judge in April, has requested the President to accept his resignation with immediate effect.

	New Delhi, Dec. 5 (PTI): A woman was burnt alive and her husband, both from Bengal, seriously injured when their car caught fire in south Delhi today.         
	Subha, 32, and her husband, S.K. Kanji, who works for a trading company in Gurgaon, were in the car when it caught fire, a senior police officer said. Kanji, who was driving the car, is in hospital.        
	Prima facie, it appears that the car caught fire because of a petrol leak.        
	The car was completely burnt. When the fire was doused, the woman was already charred to death. Her skull was visible. She probably could not come out of the car because of the seat belt, the officer said.        
	Before Kanji was able to take his car to the roadside, it caught fire and both failed to get out of it, the officer added.

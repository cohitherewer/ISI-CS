The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Telangana leader issues grim warning 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Telangana leader issues grim warning 
  - Rao tells Delhi not to somersault        G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                          Rao                                        
	Hyderabad, Dec. 17: Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao today dared the government to go slow on statehood, saying in case New Delhi went back on its word the movement would turn so violent that no police or military force would be able to contain it.        
	The TRS chiefs threat came hours after chief minister K. Rosaiah said the samaikya (integrated) Andhra campaign was more visible now while the Telangana agitators were lying low.        
	Addressing reporters for the first time since breaking his fast on the night of December 9, Rao said the state government should not be taken in by the silence of the TRS.        
	It is only a strategic silence on the request of (UPA chairperson) Sonia Gandhi and (Prime Minister) Manmohan Singh to enable them to set their house in order, he said.        
	The statehood spearhead said there was no going back on Telangana because of a vertical split in the states polity. You have seen how advocates fought in the Andhra Pradesh High Court. It will be foolish to flaunt the flag of a samaikya Andhra after all these happenings, he said.        
	Actor Chiranjeevi sought to keep the flag of united Andhra flying by sending his resignation as MLA to the Speaker.         
	Rao said the agitation against Telangana had been ignited by business groups with vested interests to defeat the movement. The Andhra movement is being carried on with the help of hired goons and it does not have any popular support, he said.        
	The TRS chief announced he was preparing a master plan of action to take the agitation further. If Rosaiah thinks that the Telangana agitation has been quelled with one statement from Delhi, he is mistaken. Hum eent ka jawab patthar se denge (We will reply to bricks with stones), he said.         
	Rao said he rested for two days after breaking his fast and had been eating rice for the past two days. It will take another two days for me to be fully energised and begin my daily routine. If need be, I will take vitamins to resume the agitation, he said.        
	The TRS plans to launch its own television channel  Telangana TV  on January 26. It will be our official channel even after Telangana is born, he said.        
	Raos threat came after the chief minister sought to douse the flames by appealing to the protesters in the name of the common man.         
	Rosaiah conceded that the protests had choked development and welfare activities and affected transport, education and industry, besides depleting revenues to the state exchequer.         
	The worst affected is the NREGA scheme which has hit daily wage earners all over the state, he said referring to what is seen as Sonia Gandhis pet scheme. The dislocation of transport services has caused prices of vegetables and essential commodities to shoot.         
	Sources in the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) said the loss of revenues to the IT, BPO and service sectors was around Rs 1,200 crore. These sectors, for which delays translate into revenue loss, suffered heavily on account of the agitation, primarily because of low attendance.         
	The Federation of Andhra Pradesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry estimates the state government lost around Rs 750 crore in revenues in the form of VAT and excise collections in the bandh and protests since November 29, when Chandrasekhar Rao began his fast. Excise losses alone account for nearly Rs 325 crore, said a spokesman for the federation.        
	Agriculture too has been hit. Losses to agricultural commodities such as the tender coconut trade has been heavy.        
	 We used to export 50 lorries of tender coconuts to Hyderabad and Telangana districts. But with the agitation, the entire supply has been stopped for two weeks, said a coconut trader from coastal Andhra.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, June 25: The school examination reforms endorsed by Kapil Sibal and meant to reduce pressure on students as well as parents are rooted in a 23-year-old policy that remains elusive even today.        
	Reforming an examination system inherited from colonial times formed a crucial section of the National Policy on Education of 1986, drafted under Rajiv Gandhis premiership.         
	The objective will be to recast the examination system so as to ensure... de-emphasis of memorisation and the use of grades in place of marks, says Section 8.24 of the NPE, the blueprint of Indias education policy.         
	Continuous and comprehensive evaluation that incorporates both scholastic and non-scholastic aspects of education should be adopted instead of terminal examinations, the policy document adds.         
	Several years later, in 2003, then Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE) chairperson Ashok Ganguly proposed, under the NDA regime, replacing Class X boards with grading based on continuous evaluation.         
	Ganguly, who remained CBSE chief under the first UPA government till August last year, worked to implement that proposal in phases over the next five years.         
	Grading was introduced instead of marking up to Class VIII for the CBSE, and internal assessment has been introduced in most subjects up to Class X, reducing the number of marks dependent on the board examination. Twenty per cent of the final marks are taken from the internal assessment and the rest from the board examinations.         
	The 2005 National Curriculum Framework to transform school teaching also proposed scrapping the board examinations.         
	But state education boards, which together represent more schools and students than the centrally run CBSE, are keen to retain their identity, and even compete with the CBSE, a retired education secretary said.         
	In several states, Class XI represents junior college where students have to gain fresh entry. In such states, students will need to continue to take the Class X board examination.         
	State boards also compete in terms of which examination system grants marks more liberally. They are unlikely to want to give up that power so easily, the retired secretary said.        
	The 100-day agenda unveiled by Sibal today is a mix of stale and new promises that his own officials admit will be hard to meet.         
	The plan includes formulating policies on at least 10 diverse sectors within education, drafting five new laws, passing three other laws, establishing 100 model colleges, 700 polytechnics and starting two planned IITs and 12 central universities.         
	But the single most significant new promise in school education is likely to be the assurance to draft a national curriculum framework for teacher education to modernise teacher training  an often neglected sector.        
	Today, we have 50 crore youths. The country will face troubled times ahead if we cannot educate and employ this massive group of people, Sibal said.        
	A panel will be set up to examine the option of mandatory accreditation  a form of ranking of institutions  of schools and higher educational institutions.         
	Like the move on examination reforms, mandatory accreditation has been promised earlier, too, to assist students and parents choose the best institutions. Accreditation for schools may, however, be voluntary to start with, Sibal hinted.         
	He promised to build consensus on the sensitive plan to introduce an All India Madarsa Board that will centrally regulate education at Islamic seminaries without interfering in religious teachings.         
	Proposed first in 2006, this plan, aimed at ensuring minimum standards of modern scientific teaching in madarsas, has repeatedly failed to take off because of opposition from powerful clerics.         
	The ministry will try to ensure that the Right to Education Bill, tabled in the Rajya Sabha, is passed in the coming budget session of Parliament, Sibal said. A policy for public private partnerships in schools education will be finalised.         
	The HRD ministry will draft laws to set up a unified higher education regulator subsuming existing regulators, and to amend the Copyright Act to meet long-term demands of artistes who complain that producers are currently favoured.         
	Laws will be drafted to punish misleading claims and other educational malpractices of higher educational institutions, and to settle grievances between teachers and their institution management.        
	Long-pending laws to regulate entry and operation of foreign education providers in India and to strengthen the national commission for minority educational institutions also find focus in Sibals 100-day agenda.         
	Broadband connectivity will be provided to 5,000 colleges in this period, while 100 colleges and 700 polytechnics will be set up and a Manipur campus of the Indira Gandhi National Tribal University will be established.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hurriyat leader booked 
                                                                                                               Hurriyat leader booked 
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Srinagar, July 21: The Jammu and Kashmir government has slapped the Public Safety Act (PSA) against Syed Ali Shah Geelani that could put the Hurriyat hardliner behind bars for up to two years without trial.         
	The Omar Abdullah government has accused Geelani, 79, of instigating people against India during last years anti-Amarnath land agitation and the recent protests over the Shopian rape and murder case, disturbing education and business in the Valley and taking money from the ISI.         
	He has been booked under the PSA but the tenure of his detention will be determined by the home department, Srinagar district magistrate Mehraj Ahmad Kakroo said.         
	Hurriyat spokesperson Ayaz Akbar said the National Conferences political vendetta against Geelani was the prime reason for his arrest.         
	Omar Abdullah has done only what his father Farooq Abdullah and grandfather Sheikh Abdullah has done before. The National Conference has a long history of targeting Geelani. He was last arrested in 2002 (during Farooqs rule) but the Mufti government released him next year, Akbar said.

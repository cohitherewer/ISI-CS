          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           Banaras Hindu University: Upgrade hurdle                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 3: The Centre plans to shelve the promised upgrade of Banaras Hindu Universitys engineering school to an Indian Institute of Technology, citing opposition from the IITs top decision-making body.        
	The upgrade was opposed last week at a meeting of the IIT Council by R. Chidambaram, member of the Prime Ministers Scientific Advisory Committee, government officials have said.         
	Now, the human resource development ministry plans to cite the opposition to freeze the transformation of one of Indias best and oldest engineering schools into an IIT.        
	The ministry had prepared a note seeking the expenditure finance committees clearance for the upgrade but is now likely to argue that the plan be kept in abeyance, a top ministry official said.         
	The committees clearance is a precursor to seeking the mandatory approval from the cabinet. The ministry, the official added, has no plans of approaching the cabinet.        
	The Institute of Technology, BHU (IT-BHU), has admitted students based on the IIT Joint Entrance Examination since 1971 and is widely regarded as the best government engineering college after the IITs. But at the council meeting, sources said Chidambaram argued the government was opening too many IITs together  six were started in 2008 and two more are planned in 2009.         
	Chidambaram also argued that IT-BHU was a crucial component of the varsity, the sources said. Separating it would hurt the university, he said.        
	A decision to backtrack from the promised upgrade is, however, unlikely to please Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati, now opposed to the ruling UPA. Mayavati is learnt to have written at least once to HRD minister Arjun Singh voicing concerns over the delay in the upgrade.         
	Early in 2008, first the Prime Minister and then Arjun had announced the government was starting eight new IITs besides converting the IT-BHU into an IIT. But in July last year, when the cabinet cleared starting eight new IITs, it did not take a decision on IT-BHU.        
	Today, a senior IT-BHU administrator questioned the opposition to the upgrade. Officially, BHU has not opposed the separation of IT-BHU, required for the conversion, he said.

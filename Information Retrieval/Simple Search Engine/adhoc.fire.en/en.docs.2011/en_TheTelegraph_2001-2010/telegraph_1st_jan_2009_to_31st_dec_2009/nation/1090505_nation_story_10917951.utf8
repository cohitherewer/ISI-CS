The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hema dances in to take Dharam place 
                                                                                                               Hema dances in to take Dharam place 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI IN BIKANER                            Dharmendra, Hema Malini: All in the family                                 
	In between gulps of chilled water from a steel lota at the BJP office here, local leader Tarun Ram winked in response to a question on how the party planned to repeat its 2004 win from the seat.        
	Tab Dharam ne jitaya, ab shayad Dharam patni jitayegi (Dharam won us the seat the last time, this time his wife may win it for us), he guffawed, playing on the phrase used for a wife in north India.        
	Superstar of yesteryears Dharmendra contested and won here for the BJP last time. He had campaigned for the party elsewhere in north Rajasthan, too.          
	But over the past five years, Dharam, as he is popularly known, showed up in his constituency only once, leading to criticism from people and the rival Congress.   
	In 2009, delimitation has made Bikaner a Scheduled Caste reserved constituency, saving the BJP the question of whether to field the actor again from the seat, which straddles the green belt of the north and the desert of the west.        
	And for star power, Dharams actress-cum-dancer wife Hema Malini was flown in to address rallies in major north Rajasthan constituencies, including Bikaner, on May 2.        
	We are extremely confident of winning the Bikaner and Churu seats of north Rajasthan. These are seats where the Vasundhara Raje government between 2003 and 2008 worked a lot on development, a state BJP leader said in Ganganagar.        
	The BJP candidate in Bikaner this time is former collector Arjun Meghwal, who quit the bureaucracy to join the party. But like Dharmendra five years ago, Meghwal faces the charge of being an outsider candidate  he isnt from Bikaner.         
	But unlike Dharmendra, who had the advantage of instant recognition and a fan following, Meghwal is relatively unknown among ordinary people, a cause of worry for the party, BJP leaders admit.        
	Like elsewhere in the country, it is in the urban centre of the constituency, Bikaner city, that the BJP is expecting maximum returns.        
	A small lake next to Bikaner fort  a source of pride for locals  that was once used by royal women as a bathing pool had turned into the citys sewage dump over several years.        
	In 2007, the Raje government cleaned the lake and beautified it into a modern-day sightseeing spot. Pedestrian paths have been built along streets and the construction of bridges over railway crossings was started.        
	But the Congress, which in 2004 won only Jhunjhunu of the five north Rajasthan seats  Ganganagar, Sikar, Churu and Bikaner are the others  is accusing the BJP of neglecting the villages.        
	In Bikaner, Congress candidate Rewat Ram Panwar, like the BJPs, appears to enjoy little name recognition among people.        
	But the Congress is pinning its hopes, not just in Bikaner but throughout north Rajasthan, on a combination of a new campaign strategy that leaders say is based on Twenty20 cricket and history.        
	Traditionally, campaigning in the region has involved focusing almost exclusively on areas and communities that have voted for the Congress in the past, said party leaders.        
	This time, we are following the 20Twenty approach just as every run, every quick single, counts in this format of cricket, our approach is that we must not neglect a single vote, said K.C. Sharma, a regional Congress veteran.         
	So campaign teams are making quick visits even to villages that have voted against the Congress traditionally to try and earn individual votes, if not the support of entire communities.         
	But in history may lie the greatest ally of the Congress. Here we look for change very quickly every few years. You will not find many seats that have been won repeatedly by one party, said hotel receptionist Ramesh Singh in Bikaner.        
	The five seats of the region voted 4-1 and 3-2 in favour of the BJP in 2004 and 1999 respectively. In the previous two Lok Sabha polls, the results were exact mirror images, with the Congress winning 4-1 and 3-2 in 1998 and 1996 respectively.        
	Assembly polls, generally held just months before the Lok Sabha elections, usually throw up results that both the Congress and the BJP view as pointers to whether there is a mood for change.         
	In December 2003, the BJP won a majority of seats in the Assembly, unseating the Congress government. A few months later, the region voted for the BJP comprehensively in the Lok Sabha elections.        
	In the state polls of December 2008, it was the Congress that triumphed in the region, equally comprehensively.        
	 Bikaner votes on May 7

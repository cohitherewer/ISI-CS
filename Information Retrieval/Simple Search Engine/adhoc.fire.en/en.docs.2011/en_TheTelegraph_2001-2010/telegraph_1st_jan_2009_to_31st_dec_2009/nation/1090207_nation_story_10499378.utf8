	Lucknow, Feb. 6: Forty-eight hours after the Ranchi-bound Garib Rath began its bizarre run from New Delhi, railway officials are still clueless on who was authorised to drive the train.         
	Sources said the baffling sequence of events could be traced to the bitter rivalry between the railway zones which try to get their personnel on board every time a new train is introduced.         
	The superfast express, on its maiden journey to the Jharkhand capital, left New Delhi at 5.10pm on Wednesday with Northern Railway driver Ram Swaroop, whose presence in the cabin has been challenged.         
	Shafeequl Alam and Manoj Kumar Singh have claimed they were supposed to have driven the train and had produced authorisation cards issued by the crew control office of Allahabad division under North Central Railway.        
	Swaroop, sources in North Central Railway claimed, had said he too had an authorisation card issued by the crew control office in Ghaziabad  under Northern Railway  but could not produce it.         
	They said Swaroop was an assistant driver who was not equipped to handle fast trains such as the Garib Rath. He drove 440km to Kanpur, the trains first stop, where he was intercepted by railway and police officials alerted by Alam and Singh giving chase on a Rajdhani Express.         
	Northern Railway sources in Delhi said two drivers, Swaroop and Rameshwar, had been assigned to man the train. However, the second driver was not to be found when the train pulled in to Kanpur on Wednesday night.         
	Only Swaroop was questioned in Kanpur, officials said, and clarified that he was not drunk as alleged by Alam and Singh.         
	Asked what their inquiries had revealed, Allahabad divisional railway manager Deepak Dave said: What inquiry? What result of probe are you talking of? It wasnt as if the train was hijacked.        
	If everything was normal, then why was Swaroop being subjected to questioning and why wasnt action being taken against Alam and Singh?         
	Dave did not give a clear response. Yes. Lets see No action has been taken so far. It is not important to take everybodys ranting seriously.        
	Railway veterans said zonal rivalry was at the root of the trouble. An official explained that whenever a train was launched, guards and drivers of various divisions tried to take control of its operation.         
	Once drivers of a division get their names listed on the roster, the entire staff of that division, including travelling ticket examiners and guards, are also picked to be part of that train, he said.        
	All of them are entitled to additional allowances for distance covered over and above their monthly salaries. For instance, drivers of superfast trains get around Rs 300 for every 100 kilometre of distance they cover.        
	Sources said a bitter war between the North Central and Northern zones broke out last night. Northern Railway officials wanted Alam and Singh to be suspended, while those from North Central wanted action against Swaroop.        
	But senior officials intervened and prevented what could have snowballed into a major row. It is now understood that the railway board chairman has summoned the zonal officials concerned to ascertain the truth, said an official, who did not wish to be named.

                                                                                                               BJP sees a huge crisis amp; betrayal
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 16: The BJP today said the government had dumped the country into an unprecedented economic crisis and betrayed the common man despite the massive Rs 1,31,317 crore allocation the Congress-led regime announced for social sector schemes.        
	Shadow Prime Minister L.K. Advani said the aam aadmi was the worst sufferer even as his fellow party leaders slammed the UPA for unbridled price rise, loss of livelihood, economic insecurity and insecurity of life and limb.        
	A joint statement issued by Jaswant Singh, Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie said the interim budget had proved that the budget P. Chidambaram presented in 2008 was a sham.        
	That budget is in tatters today both on the expenditure as well as the revenue side. By under-funding various items of expenditure and not funding at all various others, he claimed the virtue of being within the FRBM (Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management) targets, the statement said. The FRBM Act was enacted by Parliament in 2003 to bring in fiscal discipline.        
	The statement said that far from putting the economy on a path of sustained growth of 7 to 8 per cent, the UPA was leaving it with a slowdown caused by mismanagement.         
	Lollipop, says Left        
	CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury said the budget was a perorative (pompous) pre-poll document. CPI leaders called it a lollipop before polls.

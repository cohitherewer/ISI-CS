The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Taslimuddin quit blow to Lalus RJD
                                                                                                               Taslimuddin quit blow to Lalus RJD
          NALIN VERMA                                        Mohammad Taslimuddin      
	Patna, Aug. 28: Mohammad Taslimuddin, the RJDs Muslim face and former Union minister, today quit the party, dealing a blow to its already weakened Muslim Yadav base in Bihar.         
	Taslimuddin was perhaps the most recognisable Muslim leader in Lalu Prasad party.         
	Hailing from the Muslim-dominated Araria, he was the source of RJDs clout in the seemanchal (border) area Kishenganj, Purnea, Araria and Katihar  near the India-Nepal and India-Bangladesh borders.         
	Lalu has turned the RJD into a family affair. It (the party) has no respect for leaders outside the family, Taslimuddin said, explaining his reason for quitting.         
	Defeated in the Lok Sabha polls by political greenhorn and Congress debutant Md Asrarul Haque, the four-term MP was bargaining hard with the RJD boss for a party ticket for his son.         
	Taslimuddins next step is not yet known but rumours are that he will favour Nitish Kumars Janata Dal (United) in the run-up to the by-polls to the 18 Assembly seats to be held on September 9 and 10 and the 2010 Assembly elections.         
	If he joins the JD(U), he will add to the partys growing clout among Muslims and erode Lalu Prasads Muslim-Yadav base further.         
	RJD sources believe that Muslim leaders are no longer safe in Lalu Prasads party as they have failed to get a single seat in the last Lok Sabha polls.

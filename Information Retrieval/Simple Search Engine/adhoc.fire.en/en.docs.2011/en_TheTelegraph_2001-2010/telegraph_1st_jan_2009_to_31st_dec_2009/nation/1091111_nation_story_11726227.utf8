          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, Nov. 10: Security personnel today gunned down seven suspected Maoist guerrillas after a fierce gun battle that took place in Dantewada district.        
	Police constable Manmohan Sonwani was seriously injured in the encounter and was airlifted to Jagdalpur for further treatment. There, he has been admitted to Maharani Government Hospital, where his condition is reported to be critical.        
	In the meantime, the team (numbers withheld) comprising district police jawans and special police officers recovered all seven bodies that were gunned down.        
	Dantewada superintendent of police Amresh Mishra told The Telegraph that the encounter took place early in the morning around 9am near Telemargu area within Kisteram police station limits of Dantewada, 450km south of the state capital.        
	The jawans of district police and special police officers were on a regular patrol and search operation in and around the area when the rebels camping in the thickly-forested pocket opened fire. The number of rebels is not known, Mishra said.         
	The security personnel immediately took the position and retaliated. It was a heavily fought battle that lasted for an hour, Mishra said, adding that seven rebels were gunned down in the operation.         
	The killed rebels were in uniform.         
	Mishra said the Maoists who fell to police bullets were not identified yet, and that the process was underway. Two rifles, country-made pistols, Maoist uniform and a large quantity of explosives and detonators were recovered from the spot.        
	Constable Sonwanis condition is slated to be critical.

                                                                                                               Border fire at intruders
                            
	Srinagar, Jan. 25: BSF jawans opened fire last night for the first time since the Mumbai attacks along the border point through which militants had sneaked in for last Augusts shoot-and-siege mission in Jammu, reports our special correspondent.         
	BSF sources said the troops opened fire twice after they noticed suspicious movements by two to three intruders on the Pakistani side in the Kanuchak area of Jammu.        
	The BSF will lodge a formal protest at a meeting with Pakistani commanders likely to be held soon.

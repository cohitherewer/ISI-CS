                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Mamata, Left get PM ear on Bengal
          OUR BUREAU                            Manmohan Singh and Mamata Banerjee                                
	New Delhi, Dec. 4: Teams from the Trinamul Congress and the Left Front met the Prime Minister today, each armed with evidence and allegations of how the other was stoking violence in Bengal and hobnobbing with the Maoists.        
	Mamata Banerjee, deeply upset that the home ministry team that came to the state to assess law and order did not step out of Calcutta, met Manmohan Singh with her MPs in his Parliament chamber for over 40 minutes.        
	Sources said the Trinamul MPs did not directly complain against P. Chidambaram or his home ministry but indicated to Singh their unhappiness at the central team ignoring their concerns. Mamata had specifically requested that central officials visit Khanakul in Hooghly.        
	Trinamul handed the Prime Minister a 160-page document titled The murder of democracy, which listed alleged instances of the Bengal governments complicity in the violence in the state.        
	At the meeting, Mamata tried to play on the Lefts withdrawal of support to the first UPA government  amid bitterness with the Prime Minister  to stress how different the Trinamul was as an ally.        
	We told the PM we are completely behind you in the government. But please ensure that the state government follows rajdharma, Mamata told reporters outside Parliament House after the meeting.        
	Mamata also alleged her party had evidence that a senior CPM leader, who was involved in talks with Nepal Maoists, had met the Indian Maoists in the Dalma forests on the Bengal-Jharkhand border.        
	She did not name the leader, but Trinamul sources said she appeared to be hinting at CPM leader Sitaram Yechury, who had participated in talks leading to the Nepal Maoists entering the political mainstream.        
	Less than an hour before the Trinamul team met Singh, a Left delegation led by Yechury had met the Prime Minister with allegations of Trinamul-Maoist links. They claimed Trinamul was using violence to expand its base in Bengal.        
	The Left team later told reporters that Singh had assured them he would forward the documents and CDs they had given him to the home ministry for a probe.        
	The Prime Minister has been repeating that the Maoists are the biggest threat to Indias internal security. But on the other hand, members of his own cabinet and the Trinamul Congress are not only openly engaged with but are patronising the Maoists, Yechury said.        
	Asked what the Left expected the Prime Minister to do when Mamata was a partner in his coalition, Yechury said: We all talk of political morality, and we talk of the Prime Minister as a statesman. So for the sake of the countrys interests and security, he will be doing what is to be done.        
	A memorandum the Left leaders gave the Prime Minister cited the recent declaration of Maoist leader Kishanji that since they have provided support to the AITC (Trinamul) at Nandigram against the CPI (M), the AITC should come forward and help them at Lalgarh and adjacent areas.

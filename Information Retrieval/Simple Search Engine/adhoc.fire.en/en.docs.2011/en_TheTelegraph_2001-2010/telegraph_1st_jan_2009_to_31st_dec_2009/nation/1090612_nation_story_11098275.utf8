	Hyderabad, June 11: A 20-year-old man pushed his girlfriend of one year from the first floor of the historical Charminar after a two-hour quarrel today, reports our special correspondent.         
	Sameera Begum, 18, suffered severe injuries to her head and feet and is admitted in Osmania General Hospital.        
	In a statement to Charminar police, the intermediate student said Harshad Ashraff, her neighbour in the Talabkatta area of the Old City with whom she had been in love for a year, had pushed her in an attempt to kill her.        
	The two had come to the 400-year-old monument around 2pm and had quarrelled for over two hours, she added.        
	Harshad has been detained for questioning.

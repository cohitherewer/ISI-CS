The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Poorvanchal letter to PM
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Poorvanchal letter to PM
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Lucknow, Dec. 13: Mayavati wrote to the Prime Minister today seeking to create Poorvanchal, the proposed state in Uttar Pradeshs east that didnt figure in her letter last week on the formation of Bundelkhand and Harit Pradesh.        
	Rivals were quick to slam the move. The Congress called it theatrics, while Samajwadi MP Jaya Prada accused Mayavati of treating Uttar Pradesh like a cake to be cut into pieces on her whims.         
	The CM has requested him (Singh) for permission to create Poorvanchal, Bundelkhand and Harit Pradesh and expedite the procedure at the earliest, additional cabinet secretary Vijay Shankar Pandey said, releasing copies of todays letter. The BSP government, he said, will move a resolution in the Assembly after the Centres clearance.        
	Mayavatis last letter, sent on Friday, had focussed on Bundelkhand and Harit Pradesh, but was silent on Poorvanchal in the states east. But she rushed to make amends, sensing the omission could cause her damage in the region.        
	Like Bundelkhand, proposed to be made up of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh with a larger portion of the latter, Poorvanchal was originally meant to include some Bhojpuri-speaking belts of Bihar, including Ara and Buxar. But Uttar Pradesh leaders are not mentioning it now fearing resistance from the government of Bihar.        
	In Uttar Pradesh, Poorvanchal is to have 17 districts, which include Varanasi, Mirzapur, Gorakhpur, Deoria, Azamgarh and Ballia.        
	The creation of Poorvanchal is necessary for better administrative management and keeping in mind the expectations and aspirations of the local populace, Mayavati said in her letter.        
	Pandey suggested the move to carve more states from Uttar Pradesh wasnt new, claiming the government had made its opinion clear on the issue during a debate in the Assembly on October 31, 2007.         
	The first letter from the chief minister to the Centre seeking Poorvanchal, Bundelkhand and Harit Pradesh had been sent on March 16 this year, a month before the general elections, in an apparent attempt to woo the voters.        
	The Congresss scorn for the move was voiced by state party chief Rita Bahuguna Joshi. Mayavati should concentrate on develop- ment rather than these theatrics.        
	Jaya Prada, the Samaj-wadi MP, said from her constituency Rampur: Is this (Uttar Pradesh) her political cake that she will cut into pieces and dish out on her whims?

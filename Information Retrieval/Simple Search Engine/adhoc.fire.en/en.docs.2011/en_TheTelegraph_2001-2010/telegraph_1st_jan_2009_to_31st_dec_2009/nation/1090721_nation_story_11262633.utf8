	New Delhi, July 20: Arms or apparel, nothing fazes Hillary Clinton when it comes to a hard bargain.        
	In her twin stops in India  Mumbai and Delhi  the US secretary of state shopped for stuff worth Rs 20,285 and bargained for nearly every piece that caught her fancy, according to sources who accompanied her.        
	Clinton reached Dilli Haat, one of south Delhis most sought-after tourist destinations, last evening and entered through the back gate, which had been specially opened for her. She rummaged through a variety of kurtis, made by refugees from Myanmar and Afghanistan, before choosing a short green one with sparkling stars.        
	The shopkeeper had asked for Rs 200; she paid Rs 150. Regulars at Dilli Haat would vouch that shopkeepers there rarely relent on prices.        
	Clintons hard bargain came as Indian and US negotiators were trying to clinch a deal on an end-use monitoring mechanism for military hardware Delhi buys from Washington.        
	Indian apparel seemed to be high on the former US First Ladys shopping list in Mumbai, too, where she bought a red kurta for her husband Bill Clinton, a corset for daughter Chelsea, a yellow-and-green quilt and a scarf made of locally produced fabric. Sources, however, said she didnt bargain for any of these and paid Rs 20,000 for her purchases.        
	But in Dilli Haat, Clinton clearly had her way. Soon after she reached, a set of brass bangles caught her eye. But a source accompanying her said she felt that the Rs 200 price tag was too high.        
	The shopkeeper wasnt too keen on selling the bangles for anything less. Clinton hung on and, after minutes, the bangles were hers  for Rs 135.        
	An old gramophone and an antique watch also caught her eye, but she bought neither. Police officials around her say Clinton raised her eyebrows quite a bit when the owner of the curio shop asked for Rs 2,700 for the gramophone and Rs 2,500 for the watch.         
	When Clinton leaves for Bangkok tomorrow, a colourful apron designed by artist M.F. Husain will also be on the flight. The apron is a gift from a chef at ITC Maurya where she went for dinner last night.

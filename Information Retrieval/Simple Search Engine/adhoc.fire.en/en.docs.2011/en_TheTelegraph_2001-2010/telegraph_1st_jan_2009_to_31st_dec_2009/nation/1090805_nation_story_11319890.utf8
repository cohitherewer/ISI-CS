                                                                                                               Kosi floods haunt citizens
          GAUTAM SARKAR                              
	Saharsa (Bihar), Aug. 4: For Archana, a victim of the 2008 Kosi floods, Raksha Bandhan has no meaning.         
	The daughter of Bhawan Das of Beheriganj village under Madhepura district lost her only brother to the floods. Last year, she had tied the rakhi on brother Abhisheks wrists, but the breaking of the Kosi embankment on August 20, 2008, and the devastating floods afterwards swept Avishek away from her.        
	Their father, who is now trying to get his life back on tracks, is worried about his daughter. She literally lost her head and would visit the river banks and pray to the river to return her brother, said Das.         
	A year has past since the Kosi floods, but several people who lost their family members are still haunted by the nightmare of the devastation.        
	Suraj Anand, a resident of Murliganj, lost his sister, Sangita, to the floods. Sangita, who was married to a resident of Supaul, was swept away with two members of her family.         
	Every year I would visit Supaul during rakhi. Now, there is no one waiting for me at Supaul, he said.         
	Surveys conducted in relief camps by voluntary organisations last year, found out around 2,726 people missing from Kosi and Purnea divisions, out of which 728 were children.         
	The organisations had found 250 girls in relief camps whose parents were missing. Similarly, they found 400 boys in camps orphaned by the floods.         
	A official of Bihars social welfare department, on the condition of anonymity, disclosed that organisations assigned by the department to conduct relief work and the survey, hardly managed to hand over 20 to 22 per cent of such children to their next of kin at that time.         
	The remaining 78 to 80 percent of the orphaned children are still without their families, he pointed out.         
	Rakhsa Bandhan happen every year and remind me that I have lost my only sister in the last years floods, said Dayanand Thakur, a government teacher at Puranibazaar.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong finds foothold in north Bihar
                                                                                                               Cong finds foothold in north Bihar
  - Supporters expect more votes this election
          NALIN VERMA                               
	Motihari (Bihar), April 21: Though it may not lead to a seat, there is a distinct murmur of support for the Congress in north Bihar constituencies in Bihar.         
	Voters, particularly minority and upper castes, are making a loud whisper for the party in the run up to the second phase of election. The upper castes have been the proverbial oxygen to Congress in the region for 40 years, before it linked its fate with Lalu Prasad.         
	We never deserted the Congress, the party left us, leaving RJD and LJP as options against a communal BJP. We are happy to find a Congress candidate this time, said Md Izharul Haq, a muezzin (an official who calls the community for prayers) at Taqui Baba mosque in Mahnar, a part of Hajipur.         
	Izharul, who supposedly represents his zamat (community), argues that his people never thought of voting for any other but the Congress, before the demolition of the Babri mosque in 1992 after which Lalu Prasad emerged as a champion of minorities.         
	The Congresss fall coincided with the upsurge of the saffron party, compelling the former to align itself with the Mandal forces in its battle against the Kamandal (Sangh parivar), creating a Hobsons choice for its traditional supporters. While the upper caste voters shifted to the BJP, minority voters sided with Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan who got majority votes in Mithila and Vaishali.         
	The JD(U) by ignoring the upper castes, particularly Brahmins, has created disenchantment against the NDA. We will vote for the Congress without considering the caste and creed of the candidate, said Ram Pukar Singh, a Bhumihar of Raxaul in West Champaran, which has Lalu Prasads brother-in-law, Sadhu Yadav, as the Congress nominee against LJPs Prakash Jha and BJPs Sanjaya Jaiswal.        
	Despite the presence of RJD nominee Abdul Bari Sidiqui and BJP nominee Hukumdeo Narayan Yadav, Congress candidate Shakeel Ahmed is hopeful of winning from Madhubani (Mithila). It is because of the support assured to him by his community members and Brahmins.        
	What may let the Congress convert its support base into winning seats is the fact that the party has been playing absentee landlord for long in the state, leaving Lalu and Paswan to guard its turf.

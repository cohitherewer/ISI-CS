The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | US envoy calls on Advani, Naidu
                                                                                                               US envoy calls on Advani, Naidu
          OUR BUREAU                              
	May 13: US charge daffairs Peter Burleigh today met L.K. Advani, fuelling speculation that Washington was keen to improve ties with the BJP as the countdown began on who would form the next government in New Delhi.         
	PTI quoted sources as saying the two discussed bilateral ties and regional matters, particularly developments in Pakistan. The meeting was part of routine consultations, it quoted a US embassy spokesperson as saying.        
	Burleigh, a seasoned South Asia hand who speaks Hindi, Bengali, Nepali and Sinhalese, took over as chief of mission in New Delhi over a month ago after David Mulfords term as ambassador ended.         
	Sources said the meeting was significant since Advani, the BJPs prime ministerial hopeful, has softened his stance on the nuclear deal, which he had earlier vowed to renegotiate if the BJP came to power. Advani now says it will not be easy to disregard the deal because governments are a continuing matter.         
	Sources said the Obama administration realises that the previous George W. Bush regime committed a tactical blunder by not keeping the BJP abreast on the nuclear deal. This, they reasoned, was a key reason for the BJPs opposition to the deal. The Obama dispensation, they said, would fortify defences on all sides.        
	The BJP-led NDAs 1999-2004 tenure was marked by a dramatic improvement in Indias relations with the US after a brief period of strain following the Pokhran nuclear tests in May 1998.        
	Burleigh has also stirred a controversy with his two-day visit to Hyderabad from Monday when he met Andhra leaders Chandrababu Naidu (Telugu Desam) and Chiranjeevi (Praja Rajyam).         
	The meetings, each lasting almost two hours, were officially described as courtesy calls, but party sources said Burleigh asked the two leaders not to back any third front government in which the Left parties were a part and support the NDA or the UPA. Sources in the Desam said the US visitors had suggested the party should support only a stable front which was globally acceptable.         
	They only said Telugu Desams support would be crucial to any front in pursuing sound external affairs policies, particularly with the US, said Desam leader Ravula Chandrasekhar Reddy.        
	Sources said Washington was worried about the Left wielding influence in the next government.         
	The Left parties, which tried to topple the Manmohan Singh regime over the nuclear deal, have promised to review the deal and scrap the 2005 defence framework agreement if a government is formed with their support.         
	US consul-general in Hyderabad Cornelius Keur told a news conference this afternoon the meetings were a matter of courtesy and routine in nature.        
	Hyderabad consulate spokesperson Phalguna Hari Jandhyala said: Burleigh met Naidu for routine consultations. The US categorically denies any attempt to interfere in Indias political and democratic process.

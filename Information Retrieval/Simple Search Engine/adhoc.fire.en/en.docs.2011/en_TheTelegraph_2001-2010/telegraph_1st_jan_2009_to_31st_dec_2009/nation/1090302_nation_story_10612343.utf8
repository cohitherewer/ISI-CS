The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sword off Chawlas head
                                                                                                               Sword off Chawlas head
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Chawla: On course                                  
	New Delhi, March 1: Navin Chawla is expected to become poll panel chief next month after the President today rejected outgoing chief election commissioner N. Gopalaswamis recommendation to remove him as election commissioner.        
	Gopalaswamis recommendation came in late January on a BJP petition accusing Chawla, a former bureaucrat, of pro-Congress bias. The Prime Ministers Office, after consulting the law ministry, had advised President Pratibha Patil that Chawla should not be removed.        
	A Rashtrapati Bhavan communique today said the President, after careful consideration of the report of the CEC, the governments recommendation, constitutional provisions and the Supreme Court judgment, arrived at a considered opinion and has accepted the recommendation of the government.        
	With Gopalaswami due to retire on April 20, Chawla may oversee most, if not the whole, of the general election, expected in April-May. The Centre is expected to name a new election commissioner to succeed Chawla in the three-member Election Commission, whose third member is former IAS officer S.Y. Quraishi.        
	The Presidents decision comes hours before tomorrows likely meeting of the full commission, which may announce the poll schedule in a day or two. Chawla, on leave because of a knee cartilage tear, was expected to be back in Delhi tonight.        
	The Centre had earlier said the CEC was not empowered to seek a fellow commissioners removal unless the President made such a reference to him. Legal experts too had deplored Gopalaswamis move.        
	The BJP today accused the government of taking a political decision on a strictly constitutional matter.        
	Scheme spree        
	Parties are frantically flagging off schemes and announcing sops before the code of conduct kicks in with the announcement of the poll schedule. If the dates are delayed beyond this week, it will allow the government to continue with its advertisement blitz on print and TV, having booked ad space till March 6.        
	Sonia Gandhi today laid the foundation stone for a womens medical college on the Bhagat Phool Singh University campus in Khanpur Kalan, Haryana. Shipping minister T.R. Baalu did his 21st flagging-off in 15 days and Pranab Mukherjee his eighth.        
	Lalu Prasads score is nearly 75 in one month.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Jab at Marxist solution
                                                                                                               Jab at Marxist solution
  - Left rule not answer to Naxalism: Jharkhand governor        SHANTANU DATTA                          Sankaranarayanan                                        
	Ranchi, Oct. 12: Jharkhand governor K. Sankaranarayanan has refused to blame police for their inability to curb Maoist violence in a state that is groping for a fitting response to the guerrillas murder of a special branch inspector, but acknowledged the need to reassess priorities towards development.         
	Jharkhand isnt the only state where Naxalism is present, said the governor who is heading the administration of the state that is under extended Presidents rule.        
	It is an acute problem, he admitted in an interview with The Telegraph, elaborating the different nature of problems in other states where he had served as governor.        
	Arunachal had its own problems, Assam has the Bodo issue and the Ulfa Orissa and Bihar have Maoists, he explained.        
	After a long period of Marxist rule, Naxalism is rising again in Bengal. So, Marxist rule is not the answer for all this, he pointed out.         
	Then he added: Any rule is not the answer.        
	Refusing to be drawn into a controversy over perceptions that enough hadnt been done to rescue inspector Francis Indwar who was beheaded, the governor said: The police have their limitations. Under the circumstances, they are doing their best. It is very easy to kidnap a person.        
	His long-term answer to extremism was what the Centre and the Prime Minister have been stressing on. Development, development, development, the governor said.        
	Jharkhand deserves a stable government with a national outlook. A government that can co-ordinate effectively with the Centre. Thats the prescription from a governor who is facing considerable flak from the Opposition BJP, that sees a Congress pre-election design in every project he implements, every grant he sanctions and every subsidy he announces.        
	The governor counts among his achievements bread-and-butter issues such as regular sugar distribution through the public distribution system  a first in Jharkhand where sanctioned stocks were allowed to lapse for want of storage capabilities  and formation of fair price shops.        
	By and large, these measures have been welcomed, barring the BJP. The BJP has a point when it castigates the Centre for not holding elections in Jharkhand along with Maharashtra and dubs its excuse of citing the coming National Games an eyewash.         
	How can they criticise me for doing my job? I know politics better than these people and if I wanted to be in politics, I would go back to my state of Kerala, countered Sankaranarayanan who has displayed his troubleshooting skills as the convener of the United Democratic Front (a Congress-led coalition now in opposition in Kerala) for 16 years.        
	Investors threats to pull out of Jharkhand dont worry him as he feels he doesnt have a mandate to adjudicate and decide on matters such as industry and land, although the debate has stalled most of the 50-odd memoranda of understanding (MoUs) signed when the state had propped up unstable coalitions.        
	MoUs are not decisions. They are only an understanding. I dont think its a loss for the state if investors move out, Sankaranarayanan said, referring to ArcelorMittal chief L.N. Mittals recent hints that the company may explore options elsewhere.         
	The only solution lies in meaningful discussions held in a positive atmosphere, the governor added.

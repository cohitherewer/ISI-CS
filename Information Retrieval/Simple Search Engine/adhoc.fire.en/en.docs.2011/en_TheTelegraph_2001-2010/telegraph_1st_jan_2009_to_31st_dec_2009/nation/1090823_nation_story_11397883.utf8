                                                                                                               Cong Babbar punch at Mulayam 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 22: The Congress has nominated former Samajwadi leader Raj Babbar from Firozabad for the Lok Sabha bypoll due in November.         
	The seat has been vacated by Samajwadi MP Akhilesh Singh Yadav, who contested and won from both Firozabad and Kannauj.        
	Babbars nomination confirms the perception that the Congress and the Samajwadi Party are moving away from each other because the former film star is a red rag to Mulayam Singh Yadav and Amar Singh.        
	Babbar was in the Samajwadi Party for several years but left in protest against Amars alleged high-handedness and joined the Congress, shortly before the last parliamentary elections.        
	The star-turned-politician was a sticking point in the Congress-Samajwadi equation when negotiations over seats were on. One of Amars conditions was that he should not get a ticket even if he joined the Congress.         
	But the Congress went ahead and fielded him from Fatehpur Sikri. Babbar, however, lost to a Bahujan Samaj Party candidate.        
	The Congress, sources said, is banking on the calculation that Muslims, who account for 1.5 lakh votes in Firozabad, one lakh upper caste votes and Babbars caste-neutral appeal might see him through.

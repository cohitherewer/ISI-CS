The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP drags feet to chasten Jaitley
                                                                                                               BJP drags feet to chasten Jaitley
          SANJAY K. JHA                                          (From top) Advani, Jaitley, Uma, Rajnath: What next?				                                 
	New Delhi, March 17: The BJP central election committee today cleared candidates for many states, ignoring the boycott by Arun Jaitley who refused to bend despite persuasion and pressure from the RSS and other colleagues.        
	The committee did not touch on the issue even when candidates for Bihar, which is under general secretary Jaitleys charge, were decided.        
	There was pressure on party chief Rajnath Singh to resolve the issue before todays meeting, but the dominant view was the BJP should not be seen as capitulating to individual blackmail.        
	Sources said Prime Minister candidate L.K. Advani had asked Rajnath to remove Sudhanshu Mittal as co-in-charge of Assam affairs immediately as the negative publicity was harming the partys image.        
	Advani is worried about the growing impression that the BJP is a divided house. But Rajnath, emboldened by support from Murli Manohar Joshi, Sushma Swaraj, M. Venkaiah Naidu and Jaswant Singh, was in no hurry to act.        
	The sources said Rajnath might ultimately ask Mittal to quit but not before the message is driven home that Jaitleys whims had caused irreparable damage to the party.        
	Rajnath also wanted to show that work was going on normally despite Jaitleys protest and that the party chiefs authority could not be undermined, the sources said.        
	Jaitley is, however, too precious for the BJP and Mittals being Assam co-in-charge hardly means anything in terms of poll gains and losses. Sources said Mittal would be persuaded to quit soon so that the crisis blows over.        
	Jaitley got another jolt today as rumours about Uma Bhartis return to the BJP swirled again. Her comeback would hurt Jaitley more than minor irritants like Mittal.        
	Uma had listed Jaitleys off-the-record briefings to select media persons as the main reason for her disillusionment with the BJP. Her return has become a topic of discussion after she backed Advanis candidature for Prime Minister.        
	Although Uma is not likely to be taken back now, Rajnath aides hinted it would be done after the elections. This appears a ploy to nettle Jaitley as Uma would be Rajnaths natural ally. But Swaraj and Naidu are not too fond of her.

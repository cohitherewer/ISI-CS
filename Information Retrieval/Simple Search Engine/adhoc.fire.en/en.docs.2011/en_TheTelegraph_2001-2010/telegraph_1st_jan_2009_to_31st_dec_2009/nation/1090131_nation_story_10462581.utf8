                                                                                                               Hearing on baby food research
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Jan. 30: Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) will hear a petition seeking ban on pro-biotic food supplement to infants in Khurda and Sundargarh districts for research purposes.        
	ICMRs advisory committee has scheduled the hearing on February 11 in pursuance of an Orissa High Court order on a PIL petition.         
	Committee for Legal Aid to Poor, a Cuttack-based legal support advocacy outfit, had filed the petition. We will present our grievances to ICMR in New Delhi on that day, CLAP executive president Bikash Das said.        
	An American company had engaged Global Network for Women and Childrens Health Research Association to conduct research on newborn in the two districts by giving pro-biotic, a liquid baby food. The research could play a key role in checking neo-natal deaths.         
	CLAP had sought judicial intervention through the PIL alleging that the supplement violated the Infant Milk Substitute and Infant Foods Supply Act, 2003.

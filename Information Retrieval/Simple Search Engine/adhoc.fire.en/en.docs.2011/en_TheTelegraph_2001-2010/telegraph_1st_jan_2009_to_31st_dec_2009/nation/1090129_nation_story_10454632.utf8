          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Jan. 28: A young call centre employee was stabbed to death this morning allegedly by her boyfriend whom she suspected of having stolen her ATM card.        
	Pauloma Fernandes, 26, was attacked by her boyfriend of one and a half years, Aquin Martis, 22, when she returned home in the wee hours , police said. The young man later stabbed himself but is out of danger in hospital.        
	The two had been having frequent quarrels since Pauloma lost her card days back and told Aquin she suspected him, friends and relatives have told the police.        
	Their families knew about their relationship and they were to marry soon. About four or five days ago, Pauloma lost her ATM card and she suspected that Aquin stole it. They had been having repeated fights over this, according to friends and witnesses, which led to the incident. We have registered a murder offence, sub-inspector Mustaq Shaikh, who is handling the case, said.        
	The incident took place around 4am in Paulomas housing complex on Mira Road, a booming residential hub on Mumbais fringes, after she returned from office at Malad, home to a large number of call centres in Mumbai.        
	The police said Aquin had reached the building before Pauloma and was hiding behind the staircase to her flat. She apparently asked the guard to escort her to her apartment after being dropped at the main gate by an office car.        
	Taking them by surprise, Aquin stabbed Pauloma and, when the watchman tried to overpower him, bit him in a bid to escape. He then slashed himself with the knife. Both Pauloma and Aquin were rushed to hospital but the girl was declared brought dead. Pauloma, who hailed from Goa, had met Aquin when they were colleagues at a Malad call centre, sub-inspector Shaikh said.         
	The police havent found out which call centre Pauloma worked for, if she had a large amount in her bank account and whether Aquin, who is said to have left his job, had tried to withdraw the money.         
	It isnt clear which ATM card (the bank that had issued it) Pauloma was using or which call centre she was working for. We are still recording the statements of witnesses, Shaikh said.

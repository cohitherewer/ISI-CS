          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Sambalpur, April 19: Voting has been completed in most parts of western and southern Orissa. And it is now time to study the voting trends and results of the first phase of the Lok Sabha polls.        
	In spite of the scorching heat and Maoist threat, it is encouraging to see numbers that have turned up at the polling booths. The state witnessed nearly a 62 per cent turnout with Malkangiri, a red-hit zone, witnessing 41 per cent turnout. Election observers, however, are worried about the trend of city dwellers, who have maximum demands but refrain from voting.         
	Sambalpur, the headquarters of western Orissa, may well serve as an example. While the average turnout of the district was 64 per cent, Sambalpur Assembly constituency, comprising Sambalpur town and Burla and Hirakud NACs, witnessed 45 per cent of polling against rural constituencies of Kuchinda, Rengali and Rairakhol that saw turnouts of 66, 63 and 63 per cent, respectively.         
	The polling percentage in all district headquarters and major towns in western Orissa was also low, compared to the rural areas of Bargarh, Balangir, Jharsuguda and Rourkela. Commenting on the mindset of city voters who refrained from voting, a former DU professor and socio political worker Bhawani Shankar Dixit said: When people want everything from the government, they should also voluntarily come forward to present their mandate. High polling in election symbolises a healthy democracy.         
	When people are conscious of their rights, they should be equally conscious of their duties for the country, said Dixit. Even if they have no candidate of their choice, they can mention the same according to the new provisions, he said.         
	At least in towns, where more educated people reside, there should be a screening of people who have not voted and no importance should be given to their grievance or demands in future since they keep themselves away from the democratic process of governance, suggested Dixit.         
	New DRM         
	A.V. Siva Prasad has taken over as the new divisional railway manager of Sambalpur division under East Coast Railway. He succeeded B.K. Patnaik who has been transferred from here.         
	A degree engineer in electronics and telecommunication, Prasad joined the Indian Railway Service in 1981. He has extensive field experience in railway electrification projects and construction in the South Central Railway.         
	He attended improved training programmes on heavy haul operations in South Africa and railway safety in Sweden. He was also the senior professor in Indian Railways Institute of Signal and Telecommunication, Secunderabad, and served the Railways in different capacities.

	New Delhi, July 16: If Rita Bahuguna Joshi had not been from an upper caste, her remarks against Mayavati would have been mere verbal abuse, not a crime.        
	Mayavati could then have sued Joshi for defamation but she could not have locked her up under the stringent SCs and STs (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989.        
	A Supreme Court judgment passed on February 19 this year makes all that plain.        
	The judgement held that the SC/ST act applied only if the accused were neither from a Scheduled Caste nor a Scheduled Tribe. The court then quashed a police case against a person only on the ground that his caste had not been recorded.        
	Section 3(1)(x) of the act says that whoever intentionally insults or intimidates a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe, with an intent to humiliate him or her, in any place in public view commits an offence. Technically, Joshis speech meets all the criteria for invoking this section. It was made at a public place and it was intended to humiliate Mayavati.        
	Whats worse, the offences listed under the 1989 act are not bailable. People booked under this law must cool their heels in a police lock-up or a jail until and unless a court grants them bail.        
	Joshi has been refused bail and sent to 14 days judicial custody. Courts are more lenient when it comes to bail in defamation cases.        
	The SC/ST law, which applies throughout the country except Jammu and Kashmir, makes a range of acts a criminal offence  a caste slur, a gesture or act that offends the targets human dignity, incitement of people against SCs and STs, use of force against these communities.        
	The punishment can range from six months to five years. A repeat offence carries a minimum jail term of a year.        
	The act empowers a government to extern (banish) an accused from a particular area or throw him out of it  and even to attach his property. The courts too have been extremely strict in dealing with such cases.        
	The Supreme Court has even laid down the nomenclature to be used while referring to the Scheduled Castes. The word Harijan is unconstitutional and the correct terminology is Dalit, the court has said, recognising the right of these oppressed castes to dignity.

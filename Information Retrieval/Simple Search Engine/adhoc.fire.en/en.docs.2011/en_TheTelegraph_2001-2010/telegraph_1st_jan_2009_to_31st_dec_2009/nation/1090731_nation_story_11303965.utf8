The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Security kickoff with Infosys
                                                                                                               Security kickoff with Infosys
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, July 30: Infosys will become the first private company to hire a central force for security when 101 Central Industrial Security Force personnel are inducted tomorrow at the software giants headquarters in Bangalore.        
	The move follows appeals from private industrial houses, hotels and hospitals for central security after last Novembers Mumbai attacks and several other companies are likely to receive CISF security soon, sources said.        
	Infosys will have to shell out Rs 2.53 crore a year for the deployment, a sum that includes the personnels salaries which the company will pay every month. Infosys will retain its private security, with the CISF men providing a back-up in case of a terror attack.        
	The personnel, headed by an assistant commandant, have undergone training in anti-terrorist and anti-sabotage action like other specialised CISF units in the department of atomic energy and department of space, CISF spokesperson Rohit Katiyar said.        
	They have also been briefed about the culture and working of private companies, which are different from those of public or joint-sector enterprises.        
	Till now, the CISF protected all the airports, major dams and monuments, ports, power projects and atomic power plants. The government amended the CISF Act last January to enable the force to offer its services to private companies.         
	Seventy-nine companies have requisitioned CISF services, and about 15 of the applications have been primarily cleared by the home ministry. Reliances refinery at Jamnagar (Gujarat) and Wipros facility in Bangalore are among those next in line, sources said.

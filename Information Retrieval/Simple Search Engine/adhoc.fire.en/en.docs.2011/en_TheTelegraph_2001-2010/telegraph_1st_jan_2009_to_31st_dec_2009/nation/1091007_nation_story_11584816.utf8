The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hurriyat sees talks progress
                                                                                                               Hurriyat sees talks progress
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                              
	Srinagar, Oct. 6: Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq today claimed considerable progress in back-channel talks with New Delhi for the formal resumption of a dialogue between the separatists and the Union government.        
	The talks between New Delhi and the separatists for resolution of the Kashmir issue broke down in 2006 after the Hurriyat refused to join a roundtable conference, organised by the Centre, saying they would not share the table with mainstream politicians.        
	It had then said the mainstream politicians should have no say in the resolution process as the Centre already represented their position.         
	Mirwaiz returned to Srinagar on Saturday after attending a meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC) in New York, which has ruffled many a feather in the capital.        
	Official sources said the Centre has taken strong exception to the role played by Mirwaiz in making OIC appoint a special envoy, Saudi national Abdullah Bin Abdul Rahman Al Bakr, for Kashmir and his alleged pro-Pakistan rhetoric. This is likely to be a spoiler for the resumption of the talks, the sources added.        
	The back-channel contacts with the separatists were established during home minister P. Chidambarams visit to the Valley in June and it was moving in the right direction, a source said.         
	The Hurriyat chairman, however, said for the past one month, considerable progress has been made so that dialogue should restart.

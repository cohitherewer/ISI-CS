The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Terror delinked from Pak dialogue but split on spin 
                                                                                                               Terror delinked from Pak dialogue but split on spin 
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                           Gilani and Singh in Sharm-al-Sheikh on Thursday. (AFP)                                  
	Sharm-al-Sheikh, July 16: India and Pakistan signed a painfully drafted joint statement delinking terror from the composite dialogue process today but almost immediately put contrary interpretations on its implications.        
	The Pakistanis emerged from the three-hour meeting between Prime Ministers Manmohan Singh and Yousaf Raza Gilani, elated that India had agreed to resume composite dialogue, but Prime Minister Singh was quick to puncture any such impression.        
	There is no commitment to resuming the composite dialogue, Singh told Indian journalists shortly after the joint statement was released. There is no way ahead but to talk, but we are being cautious. Composite dialogue cannot resume until Pakistan takes sustained, credible and effective action against the perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks and dismantles the infrastructure of terror operating from Pakistani soil.        
	Singh said he had received assurances from his Pakistani counterpart and a delegation of parliamentarians that the neighbour would act against terror, if only because it was in their interest too.        
	But the Prime Minister indicated he was yet to be convinced about Pakistani promises. We are quite clear that there can be no composite dialogue unless action is taken.         
	The Pakistani Prime Minister claimed a diplomatic victory.        
	Asked about Pakistans contrary spin on the joint statement, Singh said: That is not my interpretation. We have said that they should not bring up composite dialogue when we bring up our concerns on terror.        
	To a query on whether he thought India-Pakistan ties had entered a state of thaw, Singh said: That only time can tell. We have begun a process because we think talks are the only way, but I cannot predict its outcome, our history is full of accidents.        
	Singh allayed suggestions that India had enacted a climbdown at Sharm-al-Sheikh, saying: All we have done is to decide to talk. We will review the dossier we have received from Pakistan, the foreign secretaries will meet and report to the foreign ministers who will meet on the sidelines of the UNGA. Composite dialogue will depend on the progress we have made during these talks, the Prime Minister said.         
	But the Indian interpretation of the joint statement notwithstanding, it appears that New Delhi has walked three-fourths of the way, rather than Singhs promised half, to accommodate Pakistan, agreeing to unambiguously delink its terror grouse from the composite dialogue process and even acceding to an unprecedented mention of Pakistani concerns on threats in Balochistan in a joint statement.        
	The key para in the statement said: Both Prime Ministers recognised that dialogue is the only way forward. Action on terrorism should not be linked to the composite dialogue process and these should not be bracketed. Prime Minister Singh said that India was ready to discuss all issues with Pakistan, including all outstanding issues.        
	This is one of those rare joint India-Pakistan statements in which Kashmir does not find specific mention but the Pakistani side has the freedom to argue the Kashmir issue stands automatically included in the category of all outstanding issues.        
	The shadow of US pressure to get talking hovers all over the agreed statement which reveals a climbdown by New Delhi  it is no longer holding out action against the Mumbai plotters and dismantling of the terror infrastructure in Pakistan as conditions for talks which the Prime Minister repeatedly said were the only way out.         
	Clearly, the Indian side is seeking shelter in terminological differences that might lie between talks and composite dialogue. There doesnt appear much cache to the Indian interpretation of the delinking today because India had linked the composite dialogue process to terror in the first place.        
	Until late last night, foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon was clearly foregrounding these issues as a prerequisite for resuming the composite dialogue. The joint statement suggests a radical shift in the Indian position overnight, or during the extended and hectic three-hour negotiations that took place between the two sides this morning at Golf Resort Hotel.        
	The scheduled one-on-one between Singh and his Pakistani counterpart quickly dissolved into an unstructured dialogue as the two delegations scrambled to draft a joint statement.        
	Foreign secretaries Menon and Salman Bashir were constantly in and out of the summit room as the two delegations waited for them to get the wording of the statement right. When officials emerged, it became immediately clear that the Pakistani side had taken away more than India might have been prepared to concede.         
	Indeed, instead of addressing Indias oft and loudly voiced problems with the Pakistan-based terror infrastructures activities, Pakistan appears to have extracted virtual parity status with India as a terror victim state.         
	Both leaders agreed that terrorism is the main threat to both countries. Both leaders affirmed their resolve to fight terrorism and to co-operate with each other to this end, the statement said. Crucially, it makes no mention of the consistent Indian demand that the Pakistanis dismantle the terror outfits operating from its soil.        
	Instead, both countries have agreed to share real time credible and actionable information on any future terrorist threats.         
	It is in this context that the Pakistani side managed to insert a line raising Balochistan. Prime Minister Gilani mentioned that Pakistan has some information on threats in Balochistan and other areas, the statement said. The Pakistani establishment has intermittently alleged a covert Indian hand in violence-ridden Balochistan, where secessionist elements have been operating for long.        
	India, on its part, iterated the need to bring the perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks to justice and secured plain assurances from the Pakistani Prime Minister on the issue. Prime Minister Gilani assured that Pakistan will do everything in its power in this regard. He said that Pakistan has provided an updated status dossier on the investigations of the Mumbai attacks and had sought additional information/evidence. Prime Minister Singh said the dossier is being reviewed, the statement said.

          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 23: The human resource development ministry has convinced the Prime Ministers Office to allow key higher education reform bills to precede a proposed new overarching regulator  defusing a stand-off threatening to delay the reforms.         
	The HRD ministry convinced the PMO on allowing the passage of the reform bills into Parliament before the proposed regulator at a meeting between officials of the two government arms today, officials told The Telegraph.         
	The outcome of todays meeting has paved the way for cabinet consideration of three proposed legislations that are central to HRD minister Kapil Sibals reforms blueprint for higher education.         
	The cabinet may next week consider bills to punish institutions that charge capitation fees or mislead students with false claims and promises, and to set up special tribunals to settle educational disputes.         
	A third bill creating a new accreditation regime may also be taken up by the cabinet soon. The ministry hopes to introduce the bills in the current session of the House.         
	The PMO, while agreeing in principle with the contents of reform legislations, had questioned the sequencing of the bills.         
	It had suggested that the proposed National Commission for Higher Education and Research (NCHER)  an overarching regulator to subsume myriad existing regulators like the University Grants Commission  should be created before introducing other reforms.         
	The NCHER would also contribute to policy-making, the PMO argued.         
	The ministry argued that reforms to check unfair practices in higher education, to set up educational tribunals and to create a new accreditation regime were largely independent of the NCHER.         
	The ministry argued that the bills to enact these proposed reforms took into account the creation of the NCHER and referred to the successor of current regulators.         
	But punishing cheat colleges, settling educational disputes expeditiously and putting in place a robust accreditation regime should not be delayed while the government works on creating the NCHER, the ministry argued.

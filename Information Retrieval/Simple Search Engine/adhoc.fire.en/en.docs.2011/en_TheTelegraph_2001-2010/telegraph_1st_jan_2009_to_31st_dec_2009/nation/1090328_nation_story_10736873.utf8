The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PM debate rebuff
                                                                                                               PM debate rebuff
                            
	New Delhi, March 27 (PTI): The Congress today dismissed as a political gimmick L.K. Advanis challenge to Manmohan Singh for a live TV debate and ridiculed his efforts to emulate US President Barack Obama through online campaigning.        
	It is a political gimmick, party general secretary Digvijay Singh told reporters.        
	However, the Prime Minister said he personally felt like going to such a debate to call Advanis bluff. But such debates did not take place in a parliamentary democracy, Singh said.        
	Singh said Advani had sought to emulate Obama by campaigning online but claimed the effort had been a failure as his website could enrol only 3,100 supporters in two years.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Raipur, Oct. 30: Maoist guerrillas killed a senior Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) office-bearer Jaisingh Manjhi, 40, and his relatives in Dantewada late last night.        
	This is the first time that rebels have targeted a senior functionary of the RSS in the BJP-ruled state.         
	According to police who spoke to the members of the Manjhi household, approximately 60 heavily-armed men entered the home at midnight.         
	Manjhi was a resident of Chindgarh village, 40km from Dantewada, and lived in an extended household.        
	The rebels allegedly took Manjhi, his brother and nephew to a nearby field. The rebels, it seems, slit the throats of Manji, his brother, Pileshwar, 37, and nephew Livir, said a police officer in Dantewada.         
	The villagers discovered the bodies in the field early in the morning. Sources said that the villagers refused to touch the bodies till the police reached the spot at 9am. The bodies were sent for post-mortem at the district headquarters hospital of Dantewada.         
	Manjis wife Jamuna is the vice-chairperson of Janpad panchayat and was in New Delhi for official work. RSS sources said that Jamuna Manjhi returned by flight to Dantewada. Pileshwar was a panchayat secretary in Kirkirpal village panchayat.        
	The murders came as a shock for the Sangh Parivar. A number of Sangh Parivar affiliates such as Vanvasi Kalyan Ashram has been working in the tribal belts for the welfare of the residents.

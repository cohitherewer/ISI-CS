The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | US measles vaccine test in India
                                                                                                               US measles vaccine test in India
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 17: A US research team has announced plans to test a dry powder inhalable vaccine against measles in India next year, describing it as a new technology to treat a disease that still kills children here.         
	Robert Sievers at the University of Colorado, Boulder, has developed a process to mix a weakened measles virus with part-gas, part-liquid carbon dioxide to produce microscopic bubbles that are dried into an inhalable powder.         
	The powder is packed in a small plastic container. A child could be vaccinated through one deep breath from the sack (container), Sievers said yesterday at the national meeting of the American Chemical Society. Human clinical trials are expected to begin next year in India after animal safety studies are completed this year, he said in a statement issued through the society.         
	But sources at the Serum Institute of India, Pune, which is collaborating in the project, said they would reserve comment on the clinical trials until they were clear about the status of the project in the US. Wed like to first understand exactly what has been achieved in the US before we can discuss clinical trials here, a source said.         
	Indian laws dont allow tests on humans after only animal trials in another country.

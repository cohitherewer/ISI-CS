The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Delhi open to discuss draft, not climate core tenets
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Delhi open to discuss draft, not climate core tenets
          JAYANTA BASU                          Jairam Ramesh                                  
	Copenhagen, Dec. 13: Environment minister Jairam Ramesh today signalled that India would not abandon the core tenets of its climate policy but was ready to discuss a draft text for a possible accord that has emerged at the climate change summit here.         
	India is ready to accept the draft as negotiating text, although it has reservations on some clauses in the document released on Friday by a group of negotiators, Ramesh said this evening in a break from parleys with delegations from some 50 countries.         
	But hopes of a legally binding deal emerging from the 12-day summit here appear to be fading amid the impasse in negotiations on multiple issues.        
	The conference, now past its midway mark, is intended to hammer out a climate accord to reduce emissions of Earth-warming greenhouse gases in the period beyond 2012.         
	The head of the UN agency for climate change indicated late on Saturday that a legally binding pact in Copenhagen appeared unlikely before the summit closes on December 18.         
	Ramesh said the onus is now on the developed countries to seal the deal in Copenhagen and insisted that China, Brazil, South Korea, Singapore and France and many of the developing countries in G77 have broadly shared Indias stand.         
	We are not here to discuss a new protocol or convention. We are working on a document based on the Kyoto Protocol, the Bali Action Plan, and the recently released Long Term Co-operative Action plan draft, Ramesh said.         
	He said India is agreeable to all but six of the 46 paragraphs in the draft text. He said paragraphs 3, 4 and 8 were not acceptable to us, as in their present shape there are no options given to us on them.        
	He said there could be discussions on paragraphs 20, 24, and 39.         
	While clause 3 states that all parties should collectively agree to a minimum of 50 per cent cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 from 1990, clause 4 wants to finalise emission peaking timeline for all countries though leniently for developing countries.         
	Clause 8 asks for comprehensive international review on actions by all countries on emissions cuts, the first such review set for 2016.         
	The other three clauses 20, 24 and 39  mainly talk about the responsibility of developing countries about taking domestic mitigation measures.         
	If we have to do mitigation and adaptation of our own then we will only remain answerable to our Parliament, though we will definitely abide by international guidelines, said Ramesh, sticking to the per capita stand of India.         
	Ramesh also said today that the text of a political statement would be ready before Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and other leaders reach Copenhaghen for the final phase of the summit, PTI reported.         
	I have clearly and categorically stated on behalf of the Government of India that our Prime Minister is not coming here to negotiate the text, Ramesh said. We must get an agreement in 2010, he said, adding that the text of a political statement should be ready by December 15.         
	The negotiations have exposed sharp differences over the Kyoto Protocol, the 12-year old treaty that imposes legally binding emissions reductions on industrialised countries, but not on developing countries.         
	Developing countries want the continuation of the Kyoto Protocol, but industrialised countries and small island states want a new agreement seeking more action from countries such as India and China.         
	Its a make-or-break situation. If we dont find some resolution to this basic problem  Kyoto or no Kyoto  nothing will be finalised on core sectors, warned an Indian negotiator. Both sides know they have to make concessions, but both want the other to make the first move. It has almost become a nerve war.         
	Yvo de Boer, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, outlined on Satur- day night the criteria to proudly walk away from Copenhagen.         
	He said if the Copenhagen conference delivered a set of decisions that immediately launch action on adaptation, technology and finance, and decisions that formulate emissions reductions targets for industrialised countries and actions by developing countries, we can very proudly walk away from Copenhagen.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mystic politician talks seat, poll fight
                                                                                                               Mystic politician talks seat, poll fight
          SUBRAT DAS                                         Prasanna  Patsani  a.k.a  chicken Baba.  Pix:  Sanjib  Mukherjee      
	Bhubaneswar, April 17: He may be known as Chicken Baba, but he is not a politician to chicken out of a good fight.         
	Prasanna Patsani (also Chicken Baba) insists that his name is a misnomer, especially since he has quit eating chicken for several years now  but Bhubaneswar voters would not refer to him in any other name.         
	Apart from the meaty name, his saffron attire and a wand in hand add that mystic twist to his personality, earning him the prefix of baba, even though he is not an ascetic. Patsani remembers he was christened when he was still with the Congress, in days when he ate chicken. I have known him for three decades now and always have referred to him as Chicken Baba, admitted Krushna Chandra Pradhan, 53, a resident of Baghamari village in Khurda district.         
	Patsani made his political debut in the Assembly in 1980 on a Congress ticket from Khurda constituency. Subsequently, he represented the area in the Assembly for three consecutive terms. He was also a cabinet minister in Biju Patnaik ministry (1990-95).        
	Later, he switched over to the Lok Sabha and scored a hattrick from the Bhubaneswar parliamentary constituency on a BJD ticket. He is now seeking re-election for the fourth term.         
	Patsani, who has been on a blow-hot, blow-cold relation with BJD boss Naveen Patnaik, has managed to get a ticket this time. Perhaps, his ready wit has worked in his favour, at least it seems to work in the Bhubaneswar Lok Sabha constituency home to politically savvy voters.         
	A versatile and interesting personality, Chicken Baba is considered a crowd-puller and an entertainer. Perhaps, it is for this reason that he has been accompanying Naveen Patnaik to election rallies across the state.        
	Though born in a small village  Ghiakhola  on the banks of the Chilika, Patsani doggedly pursued his education completing his DLit degree. An established poet, he has been awarded by Orissa Sahitya Akademi for his composition Dekhahele Kahibi Se Katha. Patsani has also published an c collection of English poems Horizon of My Himalayan Dawn.         
	Known for his off-the-cuff remarks, Patsani recently raised mirth by advising people to stay away from cellphones and laptops to boost their sex life. Mobile phones and laptops bring a lot of tension, said he.         
	Despite, remarkable statements, Chicken Babas popularity is dipping. He is seen at meetings and rallies, but never in his constituency. I have not seen him visit our area in the past 10 years, said Madhusudan Rout of Bolgarh.         
	He has no contact with his voters, said his BJP rival, Archana Nayak, hopeful of cashing in on the anti-incumbency factor against Patsani.        
	Yet another candidate banking on negative votes against Patsani, Congresss Santosh Mohanty said: Patsani has done nothing for Bhubaneswar except deliver speeches. His floor performance in the Lok Sabha was not satisfactory.        
	I have changed Bhubaneswar in the past 10 years and the voters can see that for themselves, said Patsani, listing out his achievements.        
	Achievements include the establishment of a regional centre of AIIMS, IIT-Bhubaneswar and Khurda Road-Bolangir rail line.         
	Denying the anti-incumbency factor, the three-time BJD MP said: I have not faced any hostile crowd during my campaigning. I am accessible to everybody.        
	There is a popular joke among Patsanis supporters  he had forwarded a letter to Yamaraj once.

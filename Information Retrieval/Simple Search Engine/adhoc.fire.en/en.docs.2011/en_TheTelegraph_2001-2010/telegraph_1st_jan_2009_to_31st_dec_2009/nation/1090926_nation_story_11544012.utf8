  - Online centre to solve problems in days        MUZAFFAR RAINA                                                 Omar inaugurating the grievance cell        
	Srinagar, Sept. 25: Post your grievance now: chief minister Omar Abdullah is just a click away, waiting to redress it.        
	Omar has created a call centre where people can register complaints online from any part of the world and see the results in days. The centre is accessible 24x7 through the Internet and receives toll-free phone calls eight hours a day.        
	Javed Ahmad Mir of Lalpora Beerwah had been applying in vain for restoration of drinking water supply to his village. Then I posted my complaint on September 16. There was action in three days, he said.        
	Asgar Ali, Omars political secretary, said the chief minister was personally monitoring the grievances. In cases where there is no action, he directs the officials concerned to act, he said.        
	Since its September 4 launch, the centre has received 1,465 complaints. Of these, about 400 have been disposed of and the action taken conveyed to the complainant. The rest of the complaints are in various stages of progress, an official said.        
	The moment we receive the grievance, we forward it to the department concerned for action or reply within five days. We send a reminder about pending complaints within a week, said Ram Sevak, the official in charge of the call centre.        
	The only complaints not entertained are those about employment and transfers. Most of the grievances posted are about lack of development and restoration of drinking water or power supply. Even people who have been booked under the Public Safety Act have approached us.        
	Ali said it was still an evolving concept in a state where two decades of militancy had affected work culture. Six months on, you will find the centre has become an effective means for solving peoples problems, he said.        
	The centre is connected with 120 community information centres in as many blocks, many in far-flung areas without Internet or telephone access. The complainant gets to know about the status of his complaint anytime he connects to the official Uniform Resource Locator.

                                                                                                               Makeover for Dyers fort
          GAJINDER SINGH                              
	Chandigarh, March 2: The fort where the man behind the Jallianwala Bagh massacre lived is being made ready before its doors are opened to the people.        
	The 250-year-old Gobindgarh Fort in Amritsar, which was handed over by the army to the civil administration last October, is being renovated before it is thrown open to visitors. The repairs and renovation work could take a year to be completed, a Punjab tourism department official said.        
	The state government plans to turn the fort into a national museum on the freedom struggle. It has sought the Centres help to renovate the fort and also asked for Rs 50 crore for its conservation. We want to conserve buildings of historic value in their original form and it will take time. We cannot throw the fort open to the public immediately, an official said.        
	Built in 1760, the fort was put under the armys command by the British in 1849. After Independence, the Indian Army continued to occupy it. It will still be there inside the fort, but on a smaller scale.        
	A bungalow inside the fort served as the residence of Brigadier General R.E.H. Dyer, who ordered his troops to open fire on hundreds of peaceful protesters on April 13, 1919, killing hundreds.        
	There is also a phansi ghar, which evokes memories of British brutalities. Many who lost relatives after summary trials have started scouting for information  they believe their relatives were hanged inside the fort.         
	We want to know what happened to those who disappeared under the British. We believe they were hanged inside the fort, city resident Hukam Singh said.         
	Dyer is believed to have derived pleasure by watching the hangings. The administration, however, has no list of those hanged inside the fort.

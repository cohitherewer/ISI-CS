The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Zeal-hit Sibal to seek seal
                                                                                                               Zeal-hit Sibal to seek seal
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                          Sibal                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 5: Kapil Sibal plans to seek the approval of the countrys apex education advisory panel before proceeding with his planned reforms in a bid to quell criticism that the proposed changes are being introduced without adequate consultations.         
	The human resource development minister has called the first meeting of the Central Advisory Board on Education (CABE) under this government to place before the panel reform plans that have run into a storm of criticism.        
	Sibal intends to ask the CABE to discuss his controversial plans to move towards making school education curricula more uniform, viewed by some states as a bid to centralise education, government sources said.        
	The CABE meeting is scheduled later this month in the capital, ministry sources said, tentatively suggesting that the body could meet around August 20. The board last met in January this year, under then HRD minister Arjun Singh.         
	The ministry is desperate to hold the meeting as soon as possible to get the views of members on Sibals 100-day agenda, welcomed by some but criticised by others either as too ambitious or controversial.         
	The idea is to be as ready as possible with drafts of all that we have said we will do in a 100 days when we go to the CABE meeting. Once we get broad approval from the CABE, we can officially move on the plans without allegations of unilateralism, a senior official said.        
	The CABE consists of education ministers of all states and Union territories apart from union ministers of science and technology, and HRD  who is the chairman  educationists and civil society representatives.         
	The meeting of the board will give state governments an opportunity to discuss their concerns over Sibals proposed reforms with the minister and other officials. Our idea is not to push through something unacceptable to states. But we believe we can convince states that there is merit in reforming traditional structures of our education system, a source said.         
	In 2004, after the UPA came to power for its first term, then HRD minister Arjun had revived the CABE, lying defunct through the NDA years.         
	But the first meeting of the CABE under Arjun proved tumultuous, with representatives from BJP-ruled states openly accusing the minister of politicising education.        
	Arjun was at the time just starting his desaffronisation campaign aimed at cleaning out alleged RSS sympathisers from influential posts in education.        
	Sibal is not under fire for politically controversial statements or moves, but ministry officials say they expect several states to raise concerns over the ministers proposed reforms.         
	The minister has argued repeatedly in favour of making school curricula more uniform than it is, and has said he personally believes a single education board will be more beneficial than having multiple ones.         
	He has argued that while at present, many state boards lack standards required for their students to compete with others under a uniform board, India must move towards a single board.                     
	The plan has, however, been criticised by several state governments not all run by Opposition parties  which have argued that a single board will be incapable of addressing concerns of diversity.        
	The BSP, which rules Uttar Pradesh, has said its existing single state board struggles to meet the aspirations of that vast state even now, questioning Sibals concept.         
	The BJPs Murli Manohar Joshi, a former HRD minister, has criticised Sibals 100-day agenda as superficial and violative of the tenets of federalism.        
	The CPM and other Left parties have criticised Sibals plans to encourage public-private partnerships in schools and allowing foreign universities to set up campuses here as neo-liberal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Exit Gen. Gin, enter three General Lands
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Exit Gen. Gin, enter three General Lands
          SUJAN DUTTA                          Rank of scandal: Army soldiers march on Republic Day in Delhi. File picture                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 26: A game to coin names for tainted members of the military top brass in India often ends in prefixing or suffixing their rank with the commodities they are said to have illegally traded in. So there is a Lieutenant General Daal (pulses), another three-star officer for poultry and a General Gin, a major general who parcelled booze.        
	For the first time, however, an army investigation has called to question the actions of three lieutenant generals in a suspected Rs 300-crore land scam in Bengal.        
	In coffee canteens in South Block, where officials and soldiers often gather for a break, the game of naming has hit a block  three General Lands!        
	There are about 200 major generals and 70 lieutenant generals in the army. So far, there had been cases against nine major generals and two lieutenant generals. The number of three-star officers who are now subjects of inquiry has suddenly risen to five. And only this week, another major general has been named in an army inquiry into a land scam in Ranikhet.        
	Inside the defence ministry in South Block, the phrase corruption in general is taking on an entirely new meaning right under defence minister Saint Antonys charge.        
	Army headquarters and subsequently the defence ministry now have to decide what to do after the report of the court of inquiry into the land scam.        
	Antony was closeted with the army chief, General Deepak Kapoor, after a quick visit to the Air Force Academy in Hyderabad this afternoon.        
	That military secretary Lt Gen Avadhesh Prakashs role had to be investigated in the alleged land scam along with those of Lt Gen P.K. Rath, who was a deputy chief-designate, and corps commander Lt Gen Ramesh Halgalli, has rocked South Block. The military secretary is a principal staff officer (PSO) and a key aide to the army chief.        
	Lieutenant generals and major generals are powerful officers, often commanding tens of thousands of junior officers and soldiers who look up to them. Apart from leading their men in war, these officers are also vested with judicial authority under military law to try soldiers.        
	Soldiers have been sentenced to death in courts martial headed by superior officers, usually for fragging killing a comrade or a senior  though none of the sentences have been executed because they are inevitably challenged in civilian courts.        
	Junior officers have been court-martialled for faking encounter deaths. For the first time this July, the army court-martialled a lady officer on charges that she had brought false allegations of sexual harassment against her seniors.        
	But now that these leaders and commanders are being scrutinised and their actions have been called to question, the government is worried about the impact it might have on morale.        
	This is not the first time that lieutenant generals have been reported to have been indicted. In September 2007, Lt Gen (now retired) S.K. Sahni, who was director-general (supplies and transport), was found guilty in a court martial of making money out of dry rations.        
	That court martial was headed by Lt Gen V.K. Singh, now the eastern army commander, who is next in line to be army chief though his appointment is yet to be announced. Lt Gen Singh convened the court of inquiry that summoned the military secretary and the two other generals to Calcutta.        
	The court martial also recommended administrative action against another lieutenant general, S.S. Dahiya. Both Sahni and Dahiya have since retired and have gone to court.        
	Allegations of corruption in the top hierarchy of the military play along with the intense lobbying and jostling for top jobs. The age of superannuation for major generals is 58 years and for lieu- tenant generals, 60 years. The army chief serves till the age of 62.        
	The sharp pyramid at the top of the military hierarchy means that most officers, from the rank of brigadier upwards, have to retire if they are not found eligible for promotion. At least seven major generals have gone to court challenging orders to deny or delay promotions in their absence.

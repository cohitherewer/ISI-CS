The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Question to Left: Is imperialism passe?
                                                                                                               Question to Left: Is imperialism passe?
          SUJAN DUTTA                          America-bashing                                  
	New Delhi, May 16: As the Left picks up the pieces of its shattered dreams and goes into introspection-mode, a big question that it will ask itself is: is anti-imperialism passe?         
	Is Prakash Karats campaign against US-dictated policies, the India-US civilian nuclear deal, globalisation no longer on the Indian voters political agenda?        
	The single-most important issue around which the Lefts campaign was centred for nearly all of two years in the run-up to the election was the nuclear deal.         
	Just as the Manmohan Singh government was singularly focussed on concluding it, so was Karat focussed on scuttling it.         
	But while the UPA government was successful, the Left has been a failure. It withdrew support to the government, took a campaign to the people. But even in the red forts of Kerala and Bengal that campaign did not help it mobilise votes. Maybe it lost them votes.        
	In Bengal, the election was contested on an agenda set by Nandigram. The CPM and the Left was playing on a pitch queered by Mamata Banerjee. The acquisition of land for industry at gunpoint  that was the overriding issue.         
	The CPM referred to the nuclear deal and alleged pro-US policies in an effort to mobilise Muslim votes.         
	But even that does not appear to have worked because of, first, the Sachar Committee report that showed that the welfare of minorities in the Left Front regime was wanting, and, second, the botched Rizwanur Rehman murder case made the state police suspect.         
	In other words, local issues, and not anti-imperialism appear to have dictated voter behaviour. There was also a perceived mismatch between the Lefts rhetoric and its reality.         
	While the Left rails against globalisation, its regime in Bengal bends over backwards to invite global capital (Salim) for which it tries to acquire land forcibly.        
	Similarly, the Lefts campaign among Keralas diverse polity, too, was aimed at winning Muslim votes. But corruption in the LDF regime combined with intra-party politics had become a larger issue than anti-imperialism. Pinarayi Vijayans apparent pro-liberal policies contrasted to much with his bete noire chief minister V.S. Achuthanandans more frugal ways and the CPMs inner wars were so public that the Congress could easily exploit them.        
	The risk that a revision of the anti-imperialist campaign runs, of course, is that the second edition of the UPA government can turn more brazen with its policies.         
	Even as the elections were on, the US has been pushing controversial agreements to the top of the agenda for the next administration in Delhi.        
	Among these are the Logistics Support Agreement that will allow US military machines a much greater degree of access to Indian military installations. It will also allow Indian fighter aircraft and warships to refuel in the US military bases.

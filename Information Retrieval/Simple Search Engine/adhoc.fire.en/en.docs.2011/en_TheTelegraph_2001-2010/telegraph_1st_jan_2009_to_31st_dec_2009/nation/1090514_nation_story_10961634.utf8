The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Karat on the phone to hold on to friends 
                                                                                                               Karat on the phone to hold on to friends

	New Delhi, May 13: Talk. Phone a friend. Make sure the friend is still a friend. Hope.        
	Got the drift?        
	Thats what Prakash Karat and his third front partners have been doing as polling ended for the 15th Lok Sabha today.         
	With the Telengana Rashtra Samiti already out and H.D. Kumaraswamy meeting Sonia Gandhi yesterday  though both he and father H.D. Deve Gowda swore allegiance to the front  it was a hectic day for Karat and company.         
	The CPM general secretary, who went into a huddle this morning with fellow Left counterparts from the All India Forward Bloc and the CPI, held telephone talks with Janata Dal (Secular) chief Gowda, Telugu Desam leader N. Chandrababu Naidu, ADMK boss Jayalalithaa and the BJDs Naveen Patnaik.        
	Patnaik and Naidu also held separate talks even as Jayalalithaa appeared to be keeping her options open.        
	The former Tamil Nadu chief minister, whose ADMK had an alliance with the Left, said she had got feelers from many places but would prefer to wait till the results were out on May 16 and then decide what to do after consultation with her allies.        
	Naidu called up Karat and urged him to issue a statement about a meeting of third front leaders in Delhi on May 18.        
	The meeting, a day after the CPM politburo meets, has been billed as the first round of discussions of third front parties and will also be attended by Mayavatis BSP.        
	The parties with whom the Left has electoral alliance  TDP, ADMK, BJD and JD(S)  will meet on May 18 along with the BSP. This is the first round of discussions among these parties after the elections, Karat told The Telegraph.        
	The CPM chief said he hoped a third front-led government would be in place before long and brushed aside queries about a change in stand if the results were too close. We broke away from the Congress on certain policy matters. Nothing has changed since then, and the Congress is continuing to be on the same path, he said.        
	After the results, he added, the Left parties and the allies will sit together and discuss the future course of action.        
	Asked if leaders from other parties were being contacted, Karat said: That all will happen after May 16.        
	Left leaders said though Kumaraswamy met Sonia yesterday, the Dal (Secular) was very much with the front.        
	The TRS has switched sides. But the Dal (S) is very much with us, said All India Forward Bloc general secretary Debabrata Biswas. Deve Gowda spoke with the Left leaders and said he is working to ensure a non-BJP, non-Congress government.        
	Some Left leaders were, however, not convinced by Kumaraswamys explanation  that he met Sonia to discuss state issues  and pointed to the timing, just days before the results are out.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, May 10: The police have busted an inter-district foodgrain racket, which diverted rice meant for public distribution to the open market.        
	City police seized over 1,350 bags of rice  each weighing 50kg  from the premises of an abandoned factory at Jagatpur industrial estate yesterday. Three persons have been arrested and 14 others detained.        
	A preliminary investigation has revealed that they were meant for distribution at Rs 2 per kg under the subsidised scheme among below poverty line (BPL) people.        
	The seizure indicated a racket involving pilferage of PDS rice involving that thrived on a close nexus between unscrupulous traders, middlemen and transporters, A.N. Sinha, the Cuttack deputy commissioner of police said.        
	The state government had introduced a subsidised rice scheme under which those having BPL category ration cards are provided rice from PDS shops at Rs 2 per kg. Instead, the rice is being smuggled into the open market for Rs 10-12 per kg.        
	Sources said one part of the seized rice had already been transferred from PDS-marked rice bags to unmarked bags and was ready for release to the open market. The other part was still in bags marked as PDS rice. Investigations further indicated that the Jagatpur factory was rented out to a Cuttack-based trader for godown purposes.         
	No valid document for the stock was available.        
	A sizeable part of the seized rice bags had originated from Balasore on April 27. After transferring the PDS rice into unmarked bags they were intended to be further transported to Angul and Barbil to be disposed of in the open market, the sources said. Investigations are on to trace the origin of the other rice bags

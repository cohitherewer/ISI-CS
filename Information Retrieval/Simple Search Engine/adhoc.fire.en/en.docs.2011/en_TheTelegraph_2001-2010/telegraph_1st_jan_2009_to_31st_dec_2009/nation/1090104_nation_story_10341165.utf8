                                                                                                               Capital fog hits flights, trains
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 3: Several flights and trains were cancelled as a thick blanket of fog engulfed the capital today after a relatively clear yesterday.        
	While 19 domestic and international flights were cancelled, 31 were delayed and three diverted to Mumbai.        
	The Northern Railway cancelled six trains from Delhi and announced the cancellation of another 13 from tomorrow till January 31. Several others were delayed.        
	The Udyan Abha Express running between Sri Ganganagar and Howrah was among the trains cancelled today.         
	The trains which will be cancelled from tomorrow include the Delhi-Malda Farakka Express.         
	The flights were cancelled as the runway visibility range dipped to 100 metres in the wee hours against the minimum requirement of 150 metres, said airport sources. The situation improved after 10am.        
	The capital also remained in the grip of cold wave with the minimum temperature settling at 5.4C against yesterdays 4. The cold wave is likely to continue during the next few days because of snowfall in the hill areas.        
	Late running trains include the Rajdhanis from Mumbai, Howrah, Sealdah and Rejendra Nagar (Patna).         
	Several east-bound trains, including the Poorva Express, Purvottar Sampark Kranti Express, Kalka Mail and the Northeast Express, are also running several hours late.

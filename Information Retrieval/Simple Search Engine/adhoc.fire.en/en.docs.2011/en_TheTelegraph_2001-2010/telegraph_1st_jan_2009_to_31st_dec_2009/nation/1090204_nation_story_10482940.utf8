The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pak a terror hub: Antony
                                                                                                               Pak a terror hub: Antony
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 3: Defence minister A.K. Antony today called Pakistan the epicentre of international terrorism and said all-out wars were no longer the norm to settle political disputes despite the systematic use of terrorism and irregular warfare as state policy aimed at India.         
	Antony said the Mumbai terror attacks showed that Pakistan was using militant outfits against India.         
	Antony is the latest in a long line to use the phrase epicentre of terrorism to describe Pakistan. It has been a favourite of Delhi since it was used by Jaswant Singh, then foreign minister in the NDA government in May 2002.         
	On December 11, Manmohan Singh told Parliament we have to galvanise the international community into dealing sternly and effectively with the epicentre of terrorism which is located in Pakistan.         
	Last month, the US embassys regional security officer in Islamabad, Michael Evanoff, used it in an interview.         
	The phrase resonated once again today in the Asian Security Conference at the Institute for Defence Studies and Analysis, an annual international gathering of strategic experts organised by the think tank of the defence ministry.         
	It is part of Indias campaign to mobilise global opinion to get out of Islamabad diplomatically what it cannot get out by coercion. Antonys observation that all-out wars cannot be the norm to resolve disputes is an acknowledgement of the limits of Indias coercive policy.         
	That major attacks of large magnitude can be planned and executed by elements in Pakistan totally undermines the solemn commitments to us made by its leadership that territory in its control would not be permitted to be used for terrorism, said Antony.

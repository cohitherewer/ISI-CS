	New Delhi, Nov. 2: Fight, win, wait and wait.        
	Eleven days after the election results, the Maharashtra script can be aptly titled Wait.        
	Sonia Gandhi is waiting for a few more portfolios to fall into the Congresss lap.        
	Chief minister-designate Ashok Chavan is waiting for the letter of support from ally NCP.        
	NCP boss Sharad Pawar is waiting for the Indian team to grab the ODI number one slot by beating Australia at Mohali.        
	And the governors office in Mumbai is waiting for a request for the swearing-in.        
	Tomorrow, November 3, is the deadline for constituting the Assembly.        
	Sources said Chavan and deputy chief minister-designate Chhagan Bhujbal would take oath tomorrow to fulfil the constitutional obligation of putting a government in place. The rest of the cabinet would follow after the allies strike a deal on portfolios.        
	For the past three days, no negotiations have taken place. While the Congress was busy on Saturday, Indira Gandhis 25th death anniversary, Sunday was taken as a day off.        
	Today, Sonia was preoccupied with the coming Jharkhand elections while Pawar drove to Mohali to watch the ODI.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Advani picks Arun, Sushma 
                                                                                                               Advani picks Arun, Sushma 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Sushma                                
	New Delhi, June 3: Arun Jaitley has been named the leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, while Sushma Swaraj will be the deputy to L.K. Advani, who will lead the Opposition in the Lok Sabha.        
	The decisions were taken by Advani, authorised by the BJP parliamentary party to make the choices.        
	S.S. Ahluwalia will be Jaitleys deputy. Maya Singh will be the partys chief whip in the Rajya Sabha and Ramesh Bais in the Lok Sabha.        
	Party leaders dubbed the selections obvious choices. Sushma was tipped to get the post as Advani does not trust Murli Manohar Joshi, the other contender.        
	Jaswant Singh, earlier the leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, has been elected to the Lok Sabha this time, but he wasnt considered because he lacks political clout in the party organisation.         
	Rajnath Singh is also in the Lok Sabha but, being BJP president, cant be given the dual responsibility of the leader of Opposition.        
	Besides, Sushma is considered better equipped to handle the parliamentary job, with the added advantage of being an effective speaker. Many in the BJP believe that she will eventually succeed Advani as the leader of Opposition.        
	The Rajya Sabha choices also appeared obvious. Jaitley, a powerful speaker, has a thorough understanding of constitutional niceties and parliamentary conventions.         
	But some confusion arose earlier because of reports that Jaitley was not interested in the job, allowing M. Venkaiah Naidu to throw his hat in the ring. There were reports that Jaitley wanted to avoid the office-of-profit hassles as he wasnt willing to give up his flourishing legal practice. Senior leaders rubbished the theories later.        
	They also contested suggestions that Jaitley should be held singularly responsible for the electoral defeat as campaign in-charge.         
	The party has invested so much in Sushma and Jaitley and how can they be abandoned after one defeat. They form the core of our frontline leadership, said a Rajya Sabha party MP.        
	It is true the BJP didnt have any leader in the Rajya Sabha who could have matched Jaitleys stature. Jaitley, considered a media face and a legal brain till some time ago, has built his stature over time by working in the organisation and managing elections in important states.         
	Apart from Advani, he is also close to many powerful BJP chief ministers, including Narendra Modi.         
	But another BJP hierarchy will emerge after Rajnath relinquishes his post by the year-end. Both Sushma and Jaitley could be contenders.

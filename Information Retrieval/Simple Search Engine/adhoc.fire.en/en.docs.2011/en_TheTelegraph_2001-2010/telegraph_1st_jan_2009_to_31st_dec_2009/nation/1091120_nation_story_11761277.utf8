	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 19: Be sure to keep an eye on the wildlife wardens office and Maneka Gandhi, if you plan to monkey around with animals.        
	The office of the Orissa Wildlife Warden today issued a showcause notice to Orissa University of Agriculture and Technology authorities for staging a ramp show on November 7 in which animals and birds were used as props.        
	The show, organised as a part of the universitys annual day celebrations, saw students walk the ramp with tame and wild animals, inviting criticism from activists, including Maneka Gandhi.        
	Two hares, a cobra, a rat snake and parakeets were exhibited, displayed in what the activists have labelled a very indecent manner on November 7. During the show, students also awkwardly clutched on to hens, cocks, turkeys, ducks, cranes and snakes, besides rabbits, parrots, dogs, cats and calves. The animals were displayed amid blaring music and heavy lights which scared the animals and birds.        
	Students on the ramp belonged to the universitys veterinary college.         
	It is a violation of state rules regarding performing animals. It is illegal to use any animal for public display without taking permission from the animal welfare board first. Also, display of wild animals is a cognisable offence, said Maneka Gandhi while talking of the incident.         
	The offence is grievous, especially because it was committed by an educational institution that teaches animal welfare. Animals should not be taken for granted or used for entertainment, Maneka added.        
	The showcase has been issued to Biswanath Pradhan, the dean of Veterinary College, who was also the chairman of the organising committee.         
	The charge has been filed under Section 92b of the Wildlife Protection Act-1972 punishable under Section 51 of the same act.         
	Member secretary of the People for Animals Sanjib Kumar Das has also filed an FIR in this connection.

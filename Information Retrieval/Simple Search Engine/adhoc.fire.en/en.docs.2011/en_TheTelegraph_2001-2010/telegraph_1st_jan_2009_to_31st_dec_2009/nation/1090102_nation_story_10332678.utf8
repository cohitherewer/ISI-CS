	Patna, Jan. 1 (PTI): Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar today said that he would proceed on a vikas yatra or a development march from the third week of this month.        
	Government at the door-step would be my slogan when I start my development march, Nitish said.        
	The chief minister further added that every effort would be taken to provide succour to the Kosi flood victims in the second phase of the government-sponsored relief operations.         
	During the yatra, I would make on-the-spot assessments regarding problems and try to reach a solution to those problems, he added.

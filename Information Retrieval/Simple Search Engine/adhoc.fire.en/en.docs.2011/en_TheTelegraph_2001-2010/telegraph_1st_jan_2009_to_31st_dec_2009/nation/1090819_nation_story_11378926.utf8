	Patna, Aug. 18: Bihar has reported its first confirmed case of swine flu with a senior IAS officer testing positive for the H1N1 virus.        
	Additional finance commissioner A. Santosh Mathew has been quarantined in a government accommodation here and is being administered Tamiflu  the antidote for swine flu.        
	Health department principal secretary C.K. Mishra said that the Bihar-cadre officer was infected with H1N1 virus while he was in London from where he returned last week. It appears that the officer was carrying the disease when he landed here, Mishra said.        
	Patna Medical College Hospital collected his swab samples and sent it to the National Institute of Communicable Diseases, New Delhi, which found the IAS officer to be infected with the H1N1 virus and subsequently reported it to state government officials.        
	The authorities soon quarantined Mathew in a separate government accommodation deploying a peon and a cook to take care of him.         
	His attendants have been administered prophylactic doses of Tamiflu and have been advised to use face masks, a doctor attending to Mathew said.        
	In Orissa, two more swine flu cases were confirmed today. While one is a BTech student of NIT, Rourkela, the other is a 28-year-old youth from Soro in Balasore district.

	Patna, Feb. 17: A teacher who was beaten up on her school premises by a neighbour and his accomplices died today at a public health centre in south Bihars Nawada district.         
	One Ajay Kumar Verma, with his relatives, barged into the Berauta government middle school under Narhad police station area of Nawada and beat up Munna Kumari, 35, on February 12.         
	Ajay, Munna Kumaris neighbour, alleged that the teacher had taken a loan of Rs 40,000 and had refused to return the amount despite repeated demands.         
	Students and teachers, after a while, rescued the teacher and admitted the fatally wounded woman to a local public health centre. Kumari died today in the hospital due to severe stomach and chest injuries.         
	Ajay was arrested today after the victims husband, Mahesh Choudhary, lodged an FIR at the police station. Mahesh was away on business when Ajay and his relatives assaulted his wife.

	A fast track court today awarded life sentence to two, including the lover of the murdered man. ADSJ (fast-track court 4) Satyendra Kumar Pathak held Meena Devi and her neighbour, Asharfi Kamti, guilty of murdering Ramsunder Singh and sentenced them to rigorous life imprisonment.        
	Public prosecutor Shyam Kishore Pradhan said Shiv Shanker Singh, a resident of Chanaur village under Manigachhi police station area, had complained that his brother Ramsunder Singh was killed by Asharfi Kamti, Prayag Kamti and Meena Devi for an illicit relationship with Meena.

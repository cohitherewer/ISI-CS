          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND PTI                      Women at a protest in Srinagar on Sunday. (AFP)                          
	Srinagar, Feb. 22: A murder case was filed against the army and curfew clamped in Sopore today after troops allegedly fired on civilians, killing two youths and wounding a third critically.        
	Residents alleged that a team of soldiers, travelling in a bullet-proof vehicle, had fired without provocation near a bus stand last evening. The army said militants in combat fatigues had fired first at the troops.        
	Curfew has been promulgated in Sopore town as a precautionary measure, the deputy commissioner of Baramulla, Baseer Ahmad Khan, told PTI.         
	The move came after thousands hit the streets at Bomie-Sopore in the north Kashmir town this morning, demanding punishment for the soldiers who had allegedly fired at the youths. Mohammad Amin Tantray and Javid Ahmad died while Firdous Ahmad was injured.        
	The protesters, who were carrying the body of one of the slain youths, demanded withdrawal of troops from the area.        
	An FIR under Section 302 (murder) has been lodged against the army at Sopore police station, police sources said. The army, too, has ordered an internal inquiry, a spokesperson said.        
	The police said the situation was tense but under control. Chief minister Omar Abdullah has ordered a magisterial inquiry and sought a report within 15 days.        
	This is the first major incident involving civilian deaths after Omar took over the reins of the government early last month.        
	He (the chief minister) has said exemplary punishment would be given to those found guilty. He expressed shock at the incident (and) immediately got in touch with GoC 15 Corps and senior civil officers to ascertain the details, a government spokesperson said.        
	The deputy inspector-general of police (north Kashmir), A.G. Mir, said two persons died in the incident while a third was critical.        
	We are investigating how the firing took place. The civilians claim the firing by the army was unprovoked while the army claims that there was firing by militants from the crowd, he added.        
	An army officer from 22 Rashtriya Rifles said the force had specific information about the presence of militants in the area.         
	When our team reached the spot, they asked some youths to lift their pheran (a Kashmiri dress worn during winter) to find out if they were armed, the officer said.        
	Suddenly, there was firing from the crowd  by some militants -- and one of the civilians died. Our men returned the fire and we are ascertaining how the others suffered injuries.        
	A villager, however, said it all began when several people returning from a shrine at nearby Tujjar village were frisked.        
	Some youths on motorcycles started hooting at the armymen. The soldiers got irritated and opened fire on civilians, the villager said.        
	The incident sparked protests in the town last evening following which paramilitary forces fired on the agitators, injuring five people, officials said.        
	Tehreek-e-Hurriyat acting chairman Mohammad Ashraf Sahrai was placed under house arrest to stop him from visiting Sopore and leading the funeral of one of the youths. A police team arrived at Sahrais home in uptown Srinagar and asked him not to step out, officials said.        
	Mirwaiz Umer Farooq, chairman of the moderate faction of separatist conglomerate Hurriyat Conference, condemned the killing of the youths.        
	The incident at Sopore exposes the governments zero-tolerance policy, the Mirwaiz said.

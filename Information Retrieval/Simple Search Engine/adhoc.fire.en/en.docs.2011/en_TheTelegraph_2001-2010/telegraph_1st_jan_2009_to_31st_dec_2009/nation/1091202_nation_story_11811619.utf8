          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chennai, Dec. 1: Your first callers in the morning, the humble milk vendor and newspaper boy, have come under the poll scanner ahead of two byelections in Tamil Nadu this month.        
	The Election Commission has asked the returning officers of Tiruchendur and Vandavasi to keep an eye on those delivering milk and newspapers after complaints they could be used as conduits to distribute bribes to voters. The ADMK is the main challenger to the ruling DMK in the December 19 polls to the two seats.        
	According to the directive issued by the states chief electoral officer, Naresh Gupta, parties were likely to try new methods of reaching money to voters as the candidates or their campaigners have been banned from placing money on the camphor-lit plates during the traditional welcomes or aaratis. Tokens given to those performing the aaratis have also been forbidden after it emerged that these were exchanged for cash later.        
	Gupta has also asked the officials to clamp down on distribution of saris and dhotis at marriage halls, and on feasts for voters.        
	Even the payment under NREGS should be made three days ahead of the voting day, not after that, the officials have been told. Women self-help groups should be closely watched to ensure they arent used to bribe voters.        
	The scanner turned on milk vendors and newspaper agents after complaints that some candidates, finding their well-tested bribe routes closed, were approaching them to reach cash envelopes to voters two days before voting. Our cadres came to know that DMK functionaries were asking milk and paper vendors if they would be interested in delivering (cash) envelopes to voters at the rate of Rs 10 for one. an ADMK leader said.

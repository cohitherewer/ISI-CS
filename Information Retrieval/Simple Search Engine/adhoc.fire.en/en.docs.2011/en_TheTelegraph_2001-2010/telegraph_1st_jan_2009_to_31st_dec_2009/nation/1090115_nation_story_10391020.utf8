          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 14: Foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon will reach Colombo on Friday for a two-day visit for talks with the Sri Lankan leadership.        
	Lankan troops today captured the last remaining Tamil Tiger-held area of Jaffna, establishing total government control over the strategic northern peninsula.        
	With this, the last land on Jaffna has been liberated from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a military spokesperson said.        
	Menon will hold deliberations with Lankan foreign minister Rohitha Bogollagama and other senior officials. Sources said he could also call on President Mahinda Rajapakse.        
	Bilateral issues will be discussed. We have always held that there is no military solution to the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka. The civilian fallout of the issue should be addressed, an official said.

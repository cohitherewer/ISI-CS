The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lalit rivals strike back
                                                                                                               Lalit rivals strike back
  - Meeting firm on polls, bars cricket czar from contesting        OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Modi: On bouncy track                                        
	Jaipur, Feb. 4: Nearly two-thirds of the Rajasthan Cricket Association members held an emergency meeting in a hotel here today to roll back decisions president Lalit Modi had taken.        
	The meeting, presided over by RCA secretary Subhash Joshi passed a resolution to go ahead with elections on February 22. It overturned Modis decision to strip Joshi of his authority and also sought to bar him from contesting the election.        
	Twenty-one of the 32 RCA members attended the meeting. They wrote a letter to Modi requesting him to comply with the decisions taken.        
	Eighteen secretaries and three presidents of district associations were there. Despite Modis threat and claims that the meeting would be illegal under the RCA constitution, they came at such short notice proving we enjoy majority, Joshi said.        
	The tenure of the current RCA executive ends on February 21, and the majority led by Joshi had agreed to a February 22 election. Modi overruled this, and had sought to buy time saying he would first seek the Supreme Courts opinion since a case was pending about the last election.        
	Yesterday, he wrote a letter to Joshi telling him to stay away from an Indian Premier League workshop. As you have been divested of (the) powers of RCA secretary, you need not come to Goa for the IPL workshop from Feb. 5-8, the letter said. A copy was marked to BCCI secretary N. Srinivasan.        
	The meeting presided over by Joshi also decided to write letters to banks where the RCA has accounts. The banks have told me Modi has written a letter claiming I had been divested of the powers of RCA secretary. The executive will decide who will operate the accounts. If required, we will submit the certificate from the registrar of societies regarding the change in constitution, Joshi said.         
	The members thanked the Ashok Gehlot government for reinstating the earlier RCA constitution that vested all powers in the executive committee. Modi, after he took over in 2005, had introduced amendments giving the president absolute powers.         
	The meeting passed a resolution barring Modi from contesting the next election for not disclosing he was once convicted of possessing drugs in the US and also because he was not a domicile resident of Rajasthan.        
	Modis rivals are led by Kishore Rungta, who held sway over the RCA for 40 years till he was unseated in 2005 when Modi convinced then chief minister Vasundhara Raje to hand the voting rights in the RCA to the district associations. Earlier, a panel of 80 individual members, most of them loyal to Rungta, would vote.         
	Rungta said: The meeting was held today to pass a resolution against Modi and his orders but I dont know what happened at the micro level as I am out of Jaipur.        
	Sources said Modi was informed of the meeting but declared it illegal. RCA vice-president Bimal Soni, a Modi loyalist, feigned ignorance.        
	His supporters are smelling a witch-hunt by chief minister Gehlot, who publicly accused the RCA president of having close ties with Raje.        
	Modis problems have been piling up of late. The new Congress government has formed a committee to probe property deals struck during the Raje regime, which could include one giving the Modi-led RCA the right to lease out Sawai Mansingh Stadium.        
	Government sources said Modi was also likely to be in trouble for his reported illegal purchase of two havelis in the vicinity of the Amer Fort, whose ownership rests with the state and cannot be transferred to private individuals.

                                                                                                               Varun debut in hate speech glare     -  Maneka son cries doctored tape
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY, SANJAY K. JHA AND TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                          Booked: Varun Gandhi. File picture                                        
	March 17: An FIR was filed today against Varun Gandhi, who is set to make his election debut this summer, for a hate speech he allegedly delivered at a campaign stop.        
	Acting on a complaint that the BJP candidate from Pilibhit had threatened to behead Muslims, the full Election Commission ordered a criminal case to be immediately registered against him under the Indian Penal Code and the Representation of the People Act, 1951.         
	Brij Lal, the Uttar Pradesh additional director-general of police, later said a case had been registered at Barkhera police station in Pilibhit for the speech made on the morning of March 8.        
	Varun has been booked under IPC Section 153A (prompting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion).         
	He could additionally face charges under Sections 153B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration) and 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) of the IPC as also Section 125 (promoting enmity between classes in connection with election) of the RPA.         
	Varun denied the comments attributed to him. I unequivocally state that that is neither my voice nor my language. The tape in question appears to have been doctored, he said in a statement, as the BJP stood by him, ignoring the angry protests of its Muslim faces Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and Shahnawaz Hussain.        
	Once an FIR is filed, the case has to go for trial unless a superior court quashes the charges. All these offences carry a maximum jail term of three years or a fine or both. If Varun is convicted and sentenced to two or more years in jail, he will be ineligible to contest an election for six years from the date of conviction.        
	However, the trial is unlikely to be completed before these elections. Since no one is usually arrested immediately for poll-related charges, it is possible the only consequence now could be a stern warning from the Election Commission not to repeat such speeches.         
	Since an FIR has been filed, Varun will have to list it while filing his nomination. The returning officer has the option of rejecting the papers or referring them to the Election Commission.        
	Nominations will open after the poll panel issues a notification on March 23.        
	Varun questioned why the complaint came so late. The speech was made on March 8. On March 12, the complaint reached the Election Commission office in Lucknow. On March 14, the poll panel sought a report from the district administration. The report was sent today.         
	The Election Commission transferred two district officials and suspended two for dereliction of duty.         
	It also served notices on Varun and the BJP to explain why action should not be taken against them for violation of the model code of conduct.        
	Mother Maneka Gandhi, a five-time MP from Pilibhit who left her seat for Varun, refused to comment today.        
	Varun was in Pilibhit till 11am when L.K. Advani, the BJPs candidate for Prime Minister, called and asked him to rush to Delhi. Before leaving, Varun met his mother who was campaigning in Bareilly.        
	BJP sources admitted the tough fight by the BSPs Muslim candidate in his mothers safe seat had rattled Varun.         
	Senior BJP leader M. Venkaiah Naidu parroted Varuns line that his speech had been distorted.         
	Naqvi, a party vice-president, did not buy the denial. His comments are not akin to the culture, principles and ideology of the BJP, he said.         
	Shahnawaz Hussain demanded a public apology, saying Varun Gandhi has abused the entire Muslim community.

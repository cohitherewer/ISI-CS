	Patna, Nov. 4 (PTI): Two days after expelled BJP leader Jaswant Singh admitted that he was opposed to L.K. Advanis rath yatra and the partys move to forge an alliance with Shiv Sena in Maharashtra, party leader Shahnawaz Hussain today rubbished the comments saying it held no merit.        
	These comments have no merit. Jaswantji, who I respect a lot, never voiced opposition at any level in the party against our leader, Advanis, rath yatra, Hussain told reporters here.        
	Jaswantji also did not utter a word about the party aligning with the Sena in Maharashtra, he said.        
	On November 2, the former external affairs minister at a release of the Urdu translation of his controversial book Jinnah, Partition and Independence had said that he had strongly disfavoured Advanis rath yatra and had also opposed the partys move to tie-up with Shiv Sena in Maharashtra.        
	Referring to Jaswants advocacy for Muslims, Hussain said: I have never heard Jaswantji raise issues related to Muslims when he was in the party... BJP has done a lot for him and instead of working for its interests, he wrote a book. The party rewarded him with posts, and in return, he should have shown interest in its growth.

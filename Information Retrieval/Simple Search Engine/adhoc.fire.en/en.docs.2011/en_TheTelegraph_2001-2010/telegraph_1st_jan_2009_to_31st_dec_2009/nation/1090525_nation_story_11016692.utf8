The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Axe on Azam 
                                                                                                               Axe on Azam 
                            
	Lucknow, May 24: The Samajwadi Party today expelled senior leader Azam Khan for six years for allegedly indulging in anti-party activities.         
	During the Lok Sabha elections, Khan had campaigned against Jaya Prada, the Samajwadi candidate from Rampur, angering party general secretary Amar Singh.        
	The party, while announcing the expulsion, did not mention Jaya Prada or Khans opposition to inducting Kalyan Singh, the former BJP chief minister during whose tenure the Babri mosque was demolished.        
	Samajwadi state president Shivpal Singh Yadav said Khan was expelled for anti-party activities.         
	Senior leaders earlier admitted that Khans tirade against party chief Mulayam Singh Yadavs friendship with Kalyan had hurt its fortunes in the general elections.        
	Khan had been informed about the partys decision, said Shivpal, Mulayams brother.         
	This morning, he also resigned from the post of deputy leader of the party in the Assembly. I dont know why I am not being sacked, Khan was heard telling some of his supporters.         
	According to party sources, the decision to expel him was taken by Mulayam this morning soon after receiving his resignation. The action follows Khans refusal to attend party meetings for the past six months despite reminders, said senior Samajwadi leader Ashoke Vajpayee.         
	Khan is suspected to be behind a police complaint in Rampur that accused Amar Singh of trying to instigate Jaya Prada to end her life if she lost the seat. His campaign, though, could not stop Jaya from retaining the seat.        
	Khan, the Muslim face of the Samajwadi Party, had also dubbed Kalyan a murderer as the Babri Masjid was razed during his tenure. Vajpayee said Khan continued his campaign against the party after the polls.         
	Mulayam is said to have warned Khan, and Amar, who was humiliated by the leaders slander campaign, said he would quit if no action was taken against him.         
	Khan, who resigned as member of the Samajwadi parliamentary board and national general secretary on May 17, said in Rampur today that he was relieved of an unnecessary burden that he was carrying as a member of the Samajwadi Party.         
	Asked if he would join the Congress, Khan said he would not immediately join any party and his campaign against Kalyan would not stop.

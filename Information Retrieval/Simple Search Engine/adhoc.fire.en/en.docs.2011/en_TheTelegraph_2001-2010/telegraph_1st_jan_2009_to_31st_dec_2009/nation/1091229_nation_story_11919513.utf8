          CITHARA PAUL                                        Caption      
	New Delhi, Dec. 28: The Centre is firming up a skill development scheme for poor rural youth who will be given technical training by the government for possible round-the-year employment in industry.        
	Christened Skill Development Programme for Rural BPL Youth, the scheme when implemented would go a step further than the rural job scheme under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) by creating the possibility of employment all through the year for the rural youth. In a way, this scheme is more significant than the NREGA. If NREGA aimed at providing 100 days of work, this scheme is targeting to provide 365 days of work, said an official in the rural development ministry.        
	The training, for a maximum of three months, would include basics imparted in ITIs. We want the youth to be good in all basic technical skills  a good draughtsman, a good electrician, a good plumber, said another official in the ministry.         
	The Congress believes the rural job scheme won it support in the last Lok Sabha elections, hence the massive placement-linked skill development drive targeting rural voters.        
	The objective of the skill development programme would be to ensure time-bound training and a capacity building programme for bringing a specific number of BPL families above the poverty line through placement and ensuring regular wage employment, a draft note on the scheme said.         
	Any youth from a BPL family would be eligible for training that would be conducted in villages. During job placements, SC/STs will get preference.        
	The draft assured placement for at least 75 per cent trainees. One of the main prerequisites of the programme is the commitment of industrial houses to employ the trained persons, it said.         
	For this, the government was in touch with industry, said an official. According to him, their reaction had been positive. We are concentrating mainly on industrial houses that outsource work. The rural development ministry will get the assignments from industrial houses and route these to clusters of trained persons through gram panchayats, said the official.        
	The trainees, required to be between 18 and 35 years, would be selected for placement after a test of their skills. They would also go through a screening earlier to decide what type of training each should get.         
	They would get certificates from third-party agencies acceptable to the industry. Independent assessment is important as it ensures that the candidates meet high quality standards and employment. No business house will like to recruit an inefficient person. So it is important that a third party does an assessment, the official said.        
	The Centre would bear 75 per cent of the costs, the states would bear the rest. The plan will be sent to the states.

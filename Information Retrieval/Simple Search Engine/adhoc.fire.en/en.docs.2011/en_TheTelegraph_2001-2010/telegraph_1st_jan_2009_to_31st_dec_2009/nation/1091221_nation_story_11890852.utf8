          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Dec. 20: Dissidents stepped up their campaign to replace Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) chief Anil Sharma, raising their voice for a change in the party leadership at a meeting here today.        
	The dissension was witnessed by Congress general secretary in charge of Bihar, Jagdish Tytler, who attended the meeting as did district congress chiefs. It happened despite the fact that the Congress has of late been faring well in the hustings in the state and trying to revive itself.        
	As the BPCC meet began, a section of party leaders shouted at the top of their voice, demanding Sharmas removal. They disrupted proceedings in spite of Sharma and other senior leaders requesting them to restore order.        
	Sharma should go for he has been ignoring dedicated leaders. Moreover, he lacks a mass base and clout to carry the party on to the path of revival, a party leader said, adding: We have been opposing him since his appointment as state party chief this year.        
	The dissident leaders also claimed that they had written a letter to party chief Sonia Gandhi, demanding Sharmas replacement. But Kokab Kadri, who had allegedly signed the letter, refused to testify his signature on it. Some mischievous elements in the party had forged my signature. They had sent a letter in my name. I had not signed it, Kadri said.        
	Tytler, defending Sharma, said the AICC had not received any letter against the BPCC chief. The Congress is doing well in Bihar and there is no complaint against Sharma, Tytler said.        
	Sharma, however, alleged that the Congresss arch-rivals, Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar, had planted moles in the party. The dissidents represent the voice of disgruntled elements, which had joined Lalu and Nitish but have staged a comeback, seeing the Congresss brighter future, he said. The dissension within the Congress, however, is disturbing for the party, which is engaged in the exercise to form a secular government in Jharkhand and gearing up to revive itself in Bihar.

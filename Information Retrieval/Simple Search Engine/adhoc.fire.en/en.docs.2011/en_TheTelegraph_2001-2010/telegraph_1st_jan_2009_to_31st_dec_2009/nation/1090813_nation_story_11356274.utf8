The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Techie dies in jail, family cries foul 
                                                                                                               Techie dies in jail, family cries foul 
          OUR BUREAU                                          Subhankar and Nandini		    
	Aug. 12: An online marriage portal had brought Jamshedpur youth Subhankar Katyayan and Vadodara girl Nandini Jha together two years ago.         
	On Saturday, months after their relationship apparently soured, the software professional died a lonely death in a Bangalore prison, triggering a controversy over whether it is a case of suicide or custodial death.        
	The 33-year-old MCA graduate, working for Tata Consultancy Services, was arrested on July 20 for allegedly harassing his wife and attempting to murder her. He went into depression awaiting a hearing on his bail plea and was admitted to the jail hospital on Friday.         
	Jail officials said Subhankar took an overdose of anti-depressants he had been prescribed. But his family has refused to buy the explanation. They have decided to move the National Human Rights Commission for a probe into what they suspect to be a case of custodial death.        
	According to Bangalore police, Nandinis mother, Neelam Behan, lodged a complaint with the police on June 12, accusing Subhankar of assaulting her daughter and creating a scene. The techie was also accused of asking for money from Nandinis family and sending her obscene emails. Nandini had initiated divorce proceedings.         
	The two had got married in 2007 and stayed at Rajajinagar in Bangalore for some six months before Subhankar left for Canada on a years assignment. According to the police, the two had many a spat, including one over whether their child should be born in Vadodara or in Subhankars parents house at Namda Bustee in Golmuri, Jamshedpur.         
	The techies visit to Nandinis house after their son, now seven months old, was born had ended up with the local police having to work out a compromise between them.         
	Three months ago, Nandini returned to Bangalore with her son, but stayed in a separate house. The couple were called in for a session of counselling by Bangalore police after Nandinis family complained of harassment.         
	Subhankars brother Diwakar denied the allegations.

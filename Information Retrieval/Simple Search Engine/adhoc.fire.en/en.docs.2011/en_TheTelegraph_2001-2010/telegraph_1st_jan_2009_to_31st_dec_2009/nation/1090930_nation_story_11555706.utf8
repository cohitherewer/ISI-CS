The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Doctors resign en masse
                                                                                                               Doctors resign en masse
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bangalore, Sept. 29: Nearly 3,700 government doctors in Karnataka resigned today in protest against the states inaction over their demand for higher pay.         
	The doctors carried out the threat to resign despite an assurance by Karnataka chief secretary Sudhakar Rao that chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa would hold talks with them on October 4.         
	Yeddyurappa and his ministers have gone to a village near Mysore for a three-day BJP party meeting being attended by senior leader Arun Jaitely and Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi.         
	The doctors, however, said they would continue to work till October 14, the deadline they had set for the government to meet their demands.         
	They are demanding that the pay of entry-level doctors be increased to Rs 35,000 from Rs 18,000.         
	We submitted a memorandum to the government on August 11. Today they came to know the seriousness (of it), said G.A. Srinivasa, secretary of the state government medical officers association.

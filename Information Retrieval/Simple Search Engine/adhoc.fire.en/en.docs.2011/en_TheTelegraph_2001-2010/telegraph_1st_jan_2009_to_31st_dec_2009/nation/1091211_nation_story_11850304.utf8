          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Dec. 10: The Centres decision to initiate the process for forming a Telangana state has recharged similar aspirations among regional leaders in Uttar Pradesh who want the heartland to be trifurcated.        
	While one of the demands is a Bundelkhand state, the other two are for a Harit Pradesh in the west and a Poorvanchal in the east.        
	The Bundelkhand Mukti Morcha (BMM), which has been agitating for a new state comprising 15 districts of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, is led by Raja Bundela, a regional Congress leader.        
	The BMM today announced a 300km padayatra from Chitrakoot in Uttar Pradesh to Khajuraho in Madhya Pradesh from December 16 to January 1, and called a two-day kisan maha-panchayat from January 16 in Orcha on the border between the two states.        
	Once the kisan maha-panchayat in Orcha on January 16-17 is over, a delegation of the Morcha will meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Congress president Sonia Gandhi and leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha Lal Krishna Advani in the last week of next month for their intervention for early creation of a separate Bundelkhand state, Bundela said from Mumbai.        
	The Rashtriya Lok Dal, too, has revived its demand for a separate Harit Pradesh in the western parts of Uttar Pradesh.        
	RLD president Ajit Singh said from Delhi his party would now ask the Centre to expedite the process for creation of a new Harit Pradesh.        
	In the east, regional leaders are demanding a Poorvanchal state comprising 14 districts around Varanasi.

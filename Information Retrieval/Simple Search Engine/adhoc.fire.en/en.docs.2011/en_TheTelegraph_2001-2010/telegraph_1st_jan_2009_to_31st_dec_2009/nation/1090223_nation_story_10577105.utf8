	New Delhi, Feb. 22 (PTI): A businessman was shot dead by unidentified assailants this afternoon as he stopped his car near a park to drink water.        
	Police said a financial dispute probably led to the murder of Ankit Minocha, a resident of Mehrauli.        
	Minocha was hit in the head and the back. One of his three friends in the car was injured. The police said Minocha and his friends were returning after a quarrel with two car dealers in Karol Bagh over non-payment of debts.

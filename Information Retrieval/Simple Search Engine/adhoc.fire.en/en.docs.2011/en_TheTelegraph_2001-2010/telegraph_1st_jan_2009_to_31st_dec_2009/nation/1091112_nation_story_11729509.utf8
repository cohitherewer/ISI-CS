          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar inaugurates the National Education Day celebration in Patna on Wednesday. (Deepak Kumar)                                  
	Patna, Nov. 11: The Bihar government has taken up the onus of caring for physically challenged people in the state.         
	Each and every person with disabilities, including children, will be paid Rs 200 as pension per month, said chief minister Nitish Kumar on education day today, declaring physically-challenged citizens as the states responsibility.         
	There will be no discrimination with regard to the pension. Such people of all ages and caste will be entitled to pension, said Nitish.        
	The birth of a special child becomes a source of despair in poor families of Bihar, but no more. The pension should enable parents to raise their child with care, said the chief minister.         
	The move is Nitishs way of expanding his constituency ahead of the Assembly election to be held in 2010. He already has a base among Mahadalits, EBCs and women voters through his innovative schemes promoting them.         
	He has sanctioned free houses for Mahadalits, a low caste Dalit, and has reserved 50 per cent seats in local bodies for women. The government has hiked the EBC quota in jobs and institutes. The state also granted bicycles to girls (students) from economically weak backgrounds and sources close to the chief minister said that a similar scheme would be launched for boys soon.

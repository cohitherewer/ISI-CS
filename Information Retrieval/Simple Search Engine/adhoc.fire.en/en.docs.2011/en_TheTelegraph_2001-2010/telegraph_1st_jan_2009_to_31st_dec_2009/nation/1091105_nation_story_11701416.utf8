          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jaipur, Nov. 4: An aspiring doctor stabbed to death a classmate he had been trying to befriend after she turned him down yesterday, before jumping off the roof of a campus hostel in Rajasthans lake city Udaipur.        
	Classmates of Jai Prakash, a second year MBBS student of Rabindra Nath Tagore Medical College, said he stabbed Kamla Kumari several times before racing to the roof of the boys hostel.        
	College officials and students rushed both to the hospital located on the campus but couldnt save them. Principal S.K. Kaushik said it was a sad and unfortunate incident. We made all efforts to save them but in vain.        
	Witnesses said classes had just got over on Tuesday noon and all the students were walking towards their hostels when Kamla fell a few steps behind. That was when Jai caught up with her and proposed. But she refused. Jai then caught her by the hair and, before she could run, stabbed her repeatedly.         
	A friend of Kamla, who didnt want to be named, said Jai had been pursuing her for some time. He used to call up on her mobile but she hardly responded. She had even complained about him to a cousin and her father who came to the campus and asked Jai to behave and stay away from her, the classmate said.        
	The friend also said Jai had called up on Monday and threatened her but Kamla didnt pay much attention.        
	Both Jai and Kamla came from Sikar district but were from different towns. While Kamla, who came from a business family, was from Nawalgarh, Jai, a postal employees son, was from Phagalwa.        
	Kamlas friends said she was studious and never talked about love. Friends of Jai, who too was doing well, said he listened to music most of the time and never discussed girls, especially his interest in Kamla. Police have closed the case as both students are dead.

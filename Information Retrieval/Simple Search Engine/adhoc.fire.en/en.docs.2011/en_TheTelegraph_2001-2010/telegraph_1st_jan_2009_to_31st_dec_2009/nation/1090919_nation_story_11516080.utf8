          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          The IED being taken away. (Eastern projections)                                         
	Imphal, Sept. 18: A lucky tip-off to police averted a disaster today after a militant drove a car bomb into the Raj Bhavan, parked it 200 metres from the governors office-cum-residence and left undetected.        
	Governor Gurbachan Jagat was at the Raj Bhavan at the time. The bomb, stuffed inside the cushion of the cars back seat, was powerful enough to destroy several buildings and kill scores of people, sources said.        
	The police found the 25kg improvised explosive device (IED) about half an hour after the car glided into the parking lot, having been waved in at the CRPF-guarded main gate which has no metal detector and where vehicles or visitors are not searched.        
	Senior superintendent of police (SSP) L. Kailun said the police had been tipped off about a suspicious vehicle in the Raj Bhavan parking lot, but did not name the source.        
	The Kangleipak Communist Party (Military Council) claimed responsibility, blaming the governor for the alleged rise in fake encounter killings since he assumed charge in July last year.        
	According to the visitors register at the main gate, the grey Maruti 800 (MN01W5048) arrived at 10.45am. The driver said he had come to hand a petition to the governor on behalf of a local club. He signed his name as Th. Karen, resident of Wangkhei in Imphal East.        
	Its not clear how he left. Sources said another car had followed the bomb-laden vehicle and the man may have left in it. The police later defused the bomb.        
	Sources said the IED was made of gelatine and contained iron nails and bolts. It was attached to three hand grenades, several detonators and two mobile handsets. It seems the plan was to explode it by dialling the mobiles numbers, SSP Kailun said.        
	This is the first time militants have used a car bomb to target a vital installation in the state. The security breach happened despite the Raj Bhavan being put on high alert since a grenade attack by Kangleipak last December.         
	Sources said visitors enter the Raj Bhavan freely to meet friends and relatives of officials at the quarters inside the complex.        
	A senior police officer accused the personnel posted at the Raj Bhavan of negligence. The governor has asked the director-general of police to review the security measures.

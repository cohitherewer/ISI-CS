          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Kalawati                                  
	Mumbai, Sept. 25: Will she, wont she contest that is?        
	Vidarbhas farmer widow Kalawati Bandurkar, who shot to national spotlight  and received financial assistance  after Rahul Gandhi mentioned her during last years trust motion debate, filed her nomination for the Maharashtra Assembly polls after being hospitalised since last night which triggered speculation that she wasnt keen to contest.        
	Kalawati, 48, was reportedly under intense pressure from the Congress  against whom she will contest  to withdraw from the fray. Some reports, later denied by her, had quoted Kalawati as saying she did not want to fight the polls but was being forced to do so.        
	Her decision to contest has dissenters, notably Bindeshwar Pathak, the founder of Patna-based sanitation NGO Sulabh International, who advised her to refrain from joining politics and do social work if she wished to help Vidarbha farmers. The NGO had extended financial assistance to her after Rahul highlighted her plight in his Lok Sabha speech.        
	Speculation about Kalawati intensified since last night when she could not be traced and was later found admitted in a hospital with complaints of chest pain. Today was the last day for filing nominations.        
	This morning, Kalawati, accompanied by a doctor, was driven in an ambulance from the hospital in Pandharkawada in Yavatmal to Wani constituency for filing the nomination, said Vidarbha Jan Andolan Samiti president Kishore Tiwari, who has supported her candidature.         
	She will contest on a ticket from Sharad Joshis Swantantra Bharat Party, the political outfit of the farmers organisation Shetkari Sanghatana, and fight against the Congress and the Shiv Sena.        
	The doctors said she has hypertension and seemed mentally disturbed. There is intense pressure on her from Congress leaders. She fears that Sulabh may withdraw the financial aid if she defeats the Congress candidate, alleged Tiwari. Kalawati, however, was not available for comment.        
	The last date for withdrawal of nominations is September 29, and in case Kalawati withdraws, the samiti has kept other options open. Babytai Bise, who lost her husband and demonstrated in front of the Prime Ministers house, and I have filed nominations in case Kalawati withdraws, said Tiwari.        
	Rahul had paid a surprise visit to Kalawatis house in June 2008 and days later gave her example in justifying the UPA governments quest for the Indo-US nuclear deal during the trust motion debate. Rahul said nuclear power could help alleviate poverty and change lives of widows like Kalawati who struggled to educate and marry off their children. He also mentioned the struggles of Shashikala Ringne, a daily wage labourer from Vidarbha, and her husband to educate their three children with their meagre income.        
	Soon after Rahuls speech, Sulabh Internationals Pathak announced that the NGO would deposit Rs 30 lakh in fixed deposit for Kalawati and would pay her the interest of Rs 25,000 per month. Pathak also announced that his NGO would create a similar account worth Rs 20 lakh for Ringne, and provide assistance of Rs 15,000 per month to her.         
	As promised, Sulabh then handed over Rs 6 lakh for 2008-09 and 2009-2010 to Kalawati and Rs 4 lakh to Ringne though fixed deposits for both would be opened in November, sources said.

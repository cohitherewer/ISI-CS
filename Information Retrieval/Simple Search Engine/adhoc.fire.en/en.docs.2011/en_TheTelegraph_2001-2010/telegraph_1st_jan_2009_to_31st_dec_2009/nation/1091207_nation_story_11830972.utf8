	Mumbai, Dec. 6 (PTI): Air India has proposed a 10 per cent cut in the salaries of its 150-odd expat pilots under pressure from pilots unions, sources said.        
	The airline is also considering slashing the foreign pilots bonuses by half and stopping the reimbursement of their travelling allowances, they said. The Indian Commercial Pilots Association and the Indian Pilots Guild want compatibility between the pay packages of Indian and foreign pilots, and say that pruning the expats packages can be a cost-cutting measure.        
	Air India plans to implement the proposal from January and has written to the various international pilot recruitment agencies, the sources said. The expat pilots are paid through these agencies, which are given a monthly fee. The agencies have sought time to consult the foreign pilots before accepting or rejecting the proposal.        
	Five Indian airlines  Air India, Jet Airways, Kingfisher Airlines, IndiGo and SpiceJet  now employ 810 expat pilots. Air India has around 153 foreign pilots besides 1,253 Indian pilots and about 200 trainees.

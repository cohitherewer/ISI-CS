	Cuttack, April 23: The monsoon may be less than two months away, but Cuttack Municipal Corporation is yet to carry out excavation of silt from all surface water channels here despite water logging problems in many areas.         
	The delay is important as more than two lakh people were trapped in their homes and over a lakh rendered homeless for over two days last year, when overflowing drains flooded their homes.         
	The civic body had kept in abeyance the silt clearing operation, sanitation measures and malaria control work citing election code of conduct, a senior CMC official said.         
	The work would start by the first week of May, another official said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, June 28: The Orissa government is expected to submit a report in the high court tomorrow in compliance with an order to reinstate the doctors who had been dismissed for chopping off palms of five tribals killed in the 2006 Kalinganagar police firing.        
	The compliance report is warranted for the secretary of health and family welfare department to avoid sentence for not implementing the court order issued more than a year ago.        
	The court had fixed June 29 as the date of hearing for pronouncement of verdict after finding that there had been deliberate violation of the order and rejecting the showcause reply to contempt notice on May 20.        
	Sources said the government had withdrawn the dismissal order and issued directions on Friday to reinstate the three doctors.        
	The five tribals were killed on January 2, 2006, after police opened fire on a large gathering protesting against land acquisition for a Tata Steel plant. Two days later, the tribals were handed over the five bodies with palms chopped off.        
	Pressure from rights groups had prompted the government to suspend the three doctors  Bibekananda Swain, Shantanu Kumar Sahu and Anup Kumar Nathsharma  who had chopped off the palms. The suspended doctors challenged the suspension order in the high court claiming that they had cut off the palms during post-mortem to take finger prints, a mandatory practice in cases of unidentified bodies, and that the directive had come from the administration and the police.         
	The high court had on February 27, 2008, allowed their petition and issued directions to the government to reinstate them.         
	But the government dismissed the three doctors on October 24, 2008, following submission of a report by the Orissa Human Rights Commission.        
	Subsequently, contempt petitions were filed in the high court.         
	Taking strong exception to non-implementation of order the division bench of Justice B.P. Das and Justice B.P. Ray had initiated contempt proceedings against the secretary of health and family welfare.

                                                                                                               MP son killed in Bastar attack
          SHEENA K.                                            
	Raipur, Sept. 26: Suspected Maoists shot dead the son of a Chhattisgarh BJP MP high on their hit list in an attack authorities said could have been triggered by the governments plans for a massive offensive against the rebels.        
	Another son of Baliram Kashyap, a four-time MP of the ruling party, was seriously wounded in the Ashtami morning strike at Bastar today, but doctors said his condition was stable.        
	The incident was the result of frustration among Maoists in the wake of the governments plan to launch a massive operation against the rebels, state home minister Nankiram Kanwar said. Since Baliram Kashyap is the local MP, his sons became the target, he added.        
	Sources said the assailants struck after Dinesh, Tansen and Kedar, three sons of the MP, had left the temple of their ancestral deity the family visits every year in Gurghora village on the eighth day of Navratri. Kashyap, 73, didnt go as he is not keeping well.        
	As Kedar is a state minister, heavy security arrangements had been made in the village, 30km from district headquarters Bastar. But he left after completing the rituals and his security personnel followed him. Dinesh and Tansen stayed back.        
	As soon as the force left the area, four men appeared from among a crowd that had gathered and fired point-blank at the two brothers. Three bullets slammed into Tansen, while one hit Dinesh.        
	Eyewitness Sujuram Kashyap said the assailants, who had come on bicycles, then fled into nearby forests.        
	The brothers were rushed to a hospital but doctors could not save Tansen.        
	Surgeons extracted the bullet from Dineshs body. His condition remains stable, inspector-general of police (headquarters) R.K. Vij said.        
	The pattern of the operation makes us suspect the action team of the Maoists is involved, the officer said, adding that the police had launched a hunt to catch the killers.        
	Residents said Tansen, 25, who held an important panchayat post, was a popular leader.         
	According to reports, hundreds of villagers had entered the forests in search of the assailants.                    
	Sources said the guard assigned to protect Tansen was on leave for the past four days but local police had not bothered to send a replacement. Senior officials said the matter would be probed.        
	Home minister Kanwar said public representatives had been asked to be vigilant as Maoists might launch attacks in retaliation for the governments planned operation against the guerrillas.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Gorshkov deal buzz
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Gorshkov deal buzz
                            
	Moscow, Dec. 6 (PTI): India and Russia have reached an agreement on aircraft carrier Admiral Gorshkovs price and are expected to sign a civilian nuclear pact during tomorrows summit talks between Manmohan Singh and President Dmitry Medvedev.        
	Sources said that while a general agreement had been reached on Gorshkovs price, seen as an irritant in ties, a pact was unlikely to be signed during Singhs visit here.         
	The Prime Minister landed in Moscow this evening on a three-day trip, his sixth to Russia since 2004, that will see three defence pacts signed, including one to end problems in servicing Russian military equipment.        
	The civilian nuclear pact will be significant as it will ensure uninterrupted uranium fuel from Russia, the sources said. The planned deal is considered by India as a major improvement over the 123 pact with the US under which components and fuel already supplied have to be returned if the accord is scrapped.         
	The nuclear deal, the sources said, is marked by forward-looking language in matters relating to reprocessing, nuclear equipment and transfer of technology.         
	Singh underlined its importance before leaving Delhi, telling reporters that atomic co-operation was a key pillar in bilateral ties. On Gorshkov, he said he was confident a practical solution to the price deadlock would be found.         
	India had contracted the warship in 2004 for $974 million (Rs 4,500 crore at the current rate) but Russian shipyard Sevmash hiked the price twice since 2007. It is now demanding an additional sum of over $2 billion (around Rs 9,260 crore).        
	Anti-terrorism steps and measures to boost sluggish trade are high on the agenda of the summit talks.         
	Singh and Medvedev will discuss the problem of terrorism emanating from Pakistan and Afghanistan. The Prime Minister is expected to urge the Russian leadership to ask Pakistan to stop terrorism targeting India.        
	The annual summit is the principal mechanism for the advancement of our strategic partnership with Russia. This is a partnership based on the solid foundation of long-standing friendship, deep mutual trust and strong convergence of interests, Singh, who will also meet Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, said in Delhi before taking off for Moscow.         
	Over the years, Indo-Russian multifaceted cooperation has acquired greater depth and maturity through joint efforts. We seek to strengthen these ties further... I am confident that my visit will be yet another step forward in consolidating our cooperation with Russia and in reinforcing the fact that India-Russia strategic partnership is a factor of peace and stability in the evolving international situation, he said.         
	The two leaders will also hold talks on a range of issues, including nuclear energy, at a private dinner the Russian President will host for Singh and his wife Gursharan Kaur at his countryside residence in Barvikha, outside Moscow, tomorrow. The dinner is significant as such an event has so far been held only for Barack Obama.

  - Rajya Sabha relaxes norms to avoid lapse of starred queries        RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                    
	New Delhi, Dec. 13: The Rajya Sabha will introduce a rule from Monday to ensure that starred questions do not lapse or go unanswered in the absence of the members who raised the queries.        
	Starred questions are answered orally by the minister of the relevant department or his deputy, or another minister authorised to do so with the Chairs permission, during the daily Question Hour. The ministry concerned also circulates a written reply to the question raised by the member.        
	The member and others then have the opportunity to orally ask supplementary questions in the House to which the minister replies orally.        
	So far, Rule 14 of the rules of procedure on Question Hour stated that if a member who had listed a question was not around, no other member could raise it unless he had written permission from the original questioner and the Chair allowed it. If no such request was received from the absent member, the question was passed over, although the written reply was circulated.        
	Even supplementary questions could not be asked in this case. Neither could the question be re-listed or rephrased.        
	The new rule will allow anyone among the MPs to ask three supplementary questions related to the starred one that could not be answered orally. Also, the supplementaries can be crafted in a manner to include all aspects of the main question.        
	However, the number of supplementaries in such cases will be scaled down from the regular five to three to avoid repetition.        
	A general purposes committee decided at two back-to-back meetings to amend the old rule, perturbed by the frequency with which questions were lapsing because of members who played truant or kept away under alleged extraneous pressure once their queries became known.        
	On November 30, the Lok Sabhas Question Hour lasted 25 minutes of the allocated one hour because only four of the 36 members whose names were listed had shown up.        
	On December 8, the scene was re-enacted in the Upper House, prompting Chairman Hamid Ansari to ask if the absenteeism virus had infected his House too. Six MPs didnt show up, although some of them were around in Parliament.        
	Some MPs felt that because questions were the only direct instrument that allowed the legislature to hold the executive accountable to people, they should not go waste.        
	The procedure for putting up questions is elaborate.         
	The questions submitted by members are processed by a designated committee in the Rajya Sabha secre- tariat.        
	One of the criteria for inclusion is that the question should relate to matters of public importance within the special cognisance of the minister to which it is addressed. The information sought should relate to the past three years but not to the routine, day-to-day working of public undertakings and government bodies.        
	The questions are chosen by drawing lots on specific dates in the presence of an MP.

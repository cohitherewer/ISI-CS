	New Delhi, Sept. 4: Dressed in a pink salwar kameez, Anjali looked like any other working woman, only she was handcuffed and in police custody.        
	The 31-year-old was arrested today by Delhi police for being involved in several carjacking cases.        
	Anjali, the daughter of a teacher from Unnao in Uttar Pradesh, started working as a call girl to make quick money. She lived in Delhi with her mother and uncle and over the years formed a team of four. All were arrested today for luring men and robbing them at night.        
	Anjali would stand by the roadside late at night and ask for lift, especially from men driving alone. After getting into the car, she would lure the driver for sex to a pre-planned isolated place where her gang would be waiting. They would wait till the duo were in a compromising position and then strike.         
	They would beat up the driver and steal whatever valuables they could lay their hands on. He would finally be left without his car, and sometimes even his clothes.        
	According to the police, Anjali was the planner of the gang. She thought out its every move and took the lions share of the loot from over 10 such carjacking cases.         
	Anjali, who studied till Class VIII, also had contacts in the capital who helped her sell the cars.         
	She hired the services of 26-year-old Ravi Malik, a property dealer, who joined her gang after his business suffered because of the economic downturn, the police said.

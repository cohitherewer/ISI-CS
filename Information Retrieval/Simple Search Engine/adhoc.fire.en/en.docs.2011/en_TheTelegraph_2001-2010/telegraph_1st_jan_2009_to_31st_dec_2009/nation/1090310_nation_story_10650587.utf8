The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Seat battle hots up before polls
                                                                                                               Seat battle hots up before polls
  - Bihar triumvirate to discuss nominations after Holi        NALIN VERMA                                                           Trouble among power trio        
	Patna, March 9: Trouble stares at the UPA and the NDA over seat-sharing, even as key leaders of both the camps  Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar  say that they will sit again after Holi.         
	In fact, both Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad have decided not to celebrate Holi to express their solidarity with the millions who suffered the worst floods caused by the Kosi in five north Bihar districts in 2008.        
	In response to LJPs bellicose claim of not settling on anything less than 16 Lok Sabha seats, the RJD boss, Lalu Prasad, displayed relative calm and persuasive posture.         
	I will meet Ram Vilas Paswan after Holi and decide on the seat sharing issue again, Lalu Prasad said, adding: The RJD wants all secular forces to fight together against the communal alliance in Bihar.         
	But, the trouble in Bihar is that LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan has been claiming to have control of at least four Lok Sabha seats in his partys share which the RJD had won in 2004 Lok Sabha polls.         
	And the RJD winners of 2004 polls are understandably putting pressure on Lalu Prasad not to spare the seats that have sitting RJD MPs.         
	Lalu Prasad said that alliance was not the compulsion of the RJD.         
	But we want an alliance among secular parties  Congress, RJD, LJP and NCP  to ensure that the secular votes do not get split in our battle against the communal forces.         
	Thus, Lalu Prasad adopted a persuasive posture against Paswans time and again demand of either contesting on 16 seats or on all 40 Bihar seats.         
	Paswan, probably senses that Lalu Prasad, who stands relatively weaker in the wake of his loss of power to Nitish Kumar, will eventually concede some ground and spare more seats to the LJP in comparison to eight seats that the RJD had spared to it in the 2004 polls.         
	On the other hand, the Bihar chief minister, Nitish Kumars, meeting with the BJP general secretary and in-charge of Bihar affairs, Arun Jaitely, over seat sharing a couple of days ago in New Delhi failed to cut the ice at the  least for the time being.         
	Nitish Kumar said: We will sit again after Holi to decide on the issue in Bihar.         
	The Bihar chief minister, however, hoped that Bihar will not witness a situation such as Orissa where the 10-year-old BJP-BJD alliance was broken. The BJP and JD(U) will fight in unison in the state.         
	The Nitish-led party initially asserting that the party had gained popularity among Muslims vote bank after the governments largesse to them, the JD(U) claimed for the Muslim-dominated seats.         
	The party has asked for 26 seats, against 24 it contested in the 2004 polls.         
	The BJP, too, followed suit staking its claim to the 18 seats against the 16 it contested in 2004.         
	Nitish Kumar, however, said: There will be no dispute over the seats as the JD(U) and BJP will contest in complete alliance. We will declare our candidates after Holi on all seats.

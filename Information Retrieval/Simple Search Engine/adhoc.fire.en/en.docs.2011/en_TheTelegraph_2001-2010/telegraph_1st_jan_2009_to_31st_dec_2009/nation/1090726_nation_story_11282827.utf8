                                                                                                               Judge assets bill gets CJI nod
                            
	Chennai, July 25 (PTI): Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan today said he supported a law making it mandatory for the higher judiciary to declare their assets and liabilities.        
	Asked about the proposed judges assets bill, which is before the cabinet, he said: We have already been doing it (declaring assets)... judges declare assets to the Chief Justice of India when they are appointed as judges. We want it to be made into a law.        
	Under the proposed bill, high court judges will have to disclose their assets and liabilities before the chief justice of their court. The high court chief justices will send the details of their assets to the Chief Justice of India.        
	Failure to declare or declaring false details can be presumed to be a misconduct on the part of the judge and this can be a ground for the removal of the judge, Balakrishnan said.        
	However, such declarations are not subject to provisions of Right to Information (RTI). We dont want judges to be harassed, he said.

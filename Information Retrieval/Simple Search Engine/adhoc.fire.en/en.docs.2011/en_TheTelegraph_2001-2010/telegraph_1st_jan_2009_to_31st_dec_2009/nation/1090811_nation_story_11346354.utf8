	New Delhi, Aug 10: The health ministry today asked all adults and children with symptoms of influenza to stay home, get themselves assessed by doctors and avoid work and socialising in a move to prevent the spread of pandemic influenza.         
	 The ministry has also decided to borrow senior administrators from other government departments and fly them to state capitals to persuade the states to speed up the process of expanding medical facilities to handle swine flu.         
	A review meeting of medical experts and health officials chaired by the cabinet secretary left it to local authorities to decide whether schools should be closed.         
	But school closure is not a solution, health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad said, outlining decisions taken at the meeting.         
	 If students continue to move around and socialise outside, closures would have be of no use. Instead, parents should ensure children with symptoms remain home, he added.        
	The stay-home-if-sick advisory will also apply to all adults, Azad said. The advisory comes at a time when public health experts believe the pandemic flu virus is beginning to expand.         
	Health authorities today confirmed 95 additional cases in eight cities, taking the cumulative count to 959. Seven people have died so far. At least 60 of the new infections today involved local spread.         
	Medical experts said a stay-home advisory would work well if it was accompanied by clear directives to the medical community on how to manage mild flu and spot signs of serious infection. Azad indicated that the health ministry was unhappy with states pace of preparedness.         
	Weve been writing letters. Now well send officers who will work with state authorities to identify government and private hospitals which will be able to manage the flu, Azad said.         
	The review meeting has recommended that while India waits for three local companies to produce a vaccine against H1N1, the government will pursue the import of a vaccine if it becomes available earlier. The imported vaccine stocks will be first used to protect all doctors, nurses, and paramedical staff involved in managing the flu, Azad said.         
	The meeting also decided that the government would circulate guidelines for testing the H1N1 virus to private laboratories so that they could set up capabilities for diagnosis. India has only 18 government laboratories that offer H1N1 tests.         
	The review meeting has also recommended the import of 22,000 H1N1 test kits in addition to the 27,000 which had been recently procured. The Indian Council of Medical Research has been asked to examine local development of a test kit.

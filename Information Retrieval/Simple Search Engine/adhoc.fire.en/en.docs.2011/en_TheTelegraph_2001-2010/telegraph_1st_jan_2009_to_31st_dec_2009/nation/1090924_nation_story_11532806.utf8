	Melbourne, Sept. 23 (PTI): A man accused of kidnapping his girlfriend in Australia was caught by the Indian airport authorities after he had dodged the customs official at Sydney airport and boarded an India-bound plane.        
	Julian Matthias Buchwald, 23, who was sentenced by a court in Australia, used a fake Indian passport and disguised himself with dyed hair and a fake tan.        
	Buchwald was on bail and awaiting sentence after a jury found him guilty of kidnapping his girlfriend and holding her captive in East Gippsland, the Herald Sun reported today.        
	The alarm about his disappearance was raised last week when he failed to appear at Latrobe Valley County Court.        
	Buchwald allegedly flew out from Sydney last Wednesday to India via Singapore.        
	The Indian officials refused Buchwald entry after realising his passport was fake. He was flown back to Singapore, where his true identity was confirmed, and authorities returned him to Melbourne.        
	In his absence last Friday, Buchwald had been sentenced to a minimum of five years and three months jail for the staged kidnapping.

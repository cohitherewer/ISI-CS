The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Out in cold, fourth front huddles 
                                                                                                               Out in cold, fourth front huddles 
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                               Lalu Prasad, Mulayam Singh				                                 
	New Delhi, May 17: Fourth front partners today tried to find warmth huddling together after signs that the Congress could leave them out in the cold.        
	The talks took place amid reports that Lalu Prasad had conceded to leaders of his Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) that there was little chance he would get a ministry.        
	The discussions among the fourth front allies followed a meeting of Samajwadi Party leaders Mulayam Singh Yadav and Amar Singh with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to offer support earlier in the day.        
	However, the hour-long fourth front meeting, which was held at Lalu Prasads residence and included Ram Vilas Paswan, seemed to have achieved little.         
	Amar, trying to remove the impression that the talks were about the loaves and fishes of power, said: We are not after power, we are for a secular government.        
	The Congresss Uttar Pradesh and Bihar units have expressed strong reservations about including the Samajwadis and the RJD in the cabinet. And, unless Congress chief Sonia Gandhi decides otherwise, they are likely to remain out of the new government.         
	Till late tonight, Lalu Prasad had no signal from the Congress that he would be made a minister. The railway minister, who had angered the Congress by offering it only a handful of seats in Bihar before the polls, hoped to get a letter inviting him to a UPA meeting. But that was hardly a guarantee of getting a ministerial berth.         
	Staring at the prospect of being cold-shouldered, RJD leaders blamed Lalu Prasads close aides like Premchand Gupta and Jaiprakash Narayan Yadav, both ministers, for the decision to dump the Congress. The two were also accused of not respecting the coterie around Sonia Gandhi. Since we did not respect them (the leaders close to Sonia), will they allow our leader (Lalu Prasad) to return? asked an RJD leader.         
	Publicly, though, Lalu Prasad put up a brave front, telling reporters after landing in Delhi today that he had called Sonia to congratulate her on her partys performance. Hours before, when he was about to leave Patna, he had claimed it was the other way round  Sonia had telephoned him.        
	But he did not say when he planned to meet Sonia or the Prime Minister. Whatever assistance is needed in forming the government, we will give, he added.         
	For the Samajwadis too, the fruits of power seem out of reach. The party, with 39 seats in 2004, had bailed out the UPA last July after the Left pulled the plug over the nuclear deal. This time, with its tally reduced to 23 seats, the party cant expect rewards. The Samajwadis refusal to spare more seats in Uttar Pradesh is fresh in the Congresss mind.

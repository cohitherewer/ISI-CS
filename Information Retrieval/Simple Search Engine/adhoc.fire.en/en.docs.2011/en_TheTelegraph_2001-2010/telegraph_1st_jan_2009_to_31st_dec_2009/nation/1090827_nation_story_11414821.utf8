The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Guantanamo cry in azaadi pitch
                                                                                                               Guantanamo cry in azaadi pitch
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mehbooba Mufti                                  
	Srinagar, Aug. 26: Peoples Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti today championed the cause of the separatist brigade, saying azaadi sentiment cannot be crushed by force.        
	Mehboobas defence of the pro-azaadi lobby is the strongest by any mainstream leader after Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs assertion on August 15 that there is no place for separatist thought in Kashmir.        
	Separatist sentiment in J amp;K cannot be addressed by filling jails or muzzling the voice of dissent but it needs a bold political handling to reach out to the people. Sixty-two years of our suffering should be enough for us to raise the level of debate on Kashmir from petty partisan bickering to an informed joint effort for dignified life, Mehbooba said on the floor of the Assembly.        
	In a statement issued to the media later, the PDP leader said: azaadi sentiment cannot be crushed by force.         
	Mehbooba was apparently referring to the arrest of Hurriyat hardline leaders, including Syed Ali Shah Geelani, who have been booked under the Public Safety Act which allows their detention without trial for up to two years.        
	The rabble-rousing PDP leader has in the past criticised the government for arresting the ailing separatist leader.         
	Taking that discourse forward, she said the denial of justice to the victims had turned the state into a virtual Guantanamo Bay (the notorious US detention centre in Cuba) of (the) Indian legal and political landscape.         
	Azaadi sentiment cannot be tackled without understanding its genesis and responding to it with an alternativeAll institutions ranging from (the) police station to the highest judicial forum of the country have been unable to protect the dignity, life and honour of the residents of J amp;K, the PDP leader said in the Assembly.        
	Mehbooba said youths were being arrested in and outside the state on flimsy or no grounds merely because of their name. Nobody ever knows what happens to these unfortunate young men, she added.        
	The PDP president blamed the policies of the Centre for giving birth to the demand of plebiscite or azaadi.         
	The Centre through a series of acts has shaken the confidence of the people of the state which fed alienation among them, she said.        
	Mehbooba sought to pre-empt any adverse reaction to her remarks. It has become a fashion to dub anybody trying to speak up for the people of J amp;K as separatists. It would not deter my party to pursue that agenda, she said.        
	When we asked for double currency, there was uproar all around and even the Prime Minister inquired about it from me. It has becoming (sic) a necessity that cannot be avoided, she said.        
	Mehbooba appeared critical of former Chief Minister Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah for handing over Kashmir to India on a platter.        
	Abdullahs grandson Omar, the current chief minister, today joined the proceedings after staying away from the House for quite a long time following the PDPs accusation that he figures in the 2006 sex scandal.

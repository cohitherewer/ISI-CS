                                                                                                               Murder news Maoist trap
          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, Aug. 14: Maoists allegedly spread a rumour of the murder of eight members of a family to trap security personnel in the Koilibeda area of Kanker district.        
	Ramain Vishwakarma, a villager from Kesekodi in Koilibeda, stunned the state on Wednesday by lodging a complaint with Kanker town police, stating that Maoists had killed eight members of his family.         
	While state director-general of police Vishwa Ranjan confirmed the complaint, chief minister Raman Singh was quick to condemn the incident. Kanker SP Ajay Yadav was, however, wary of confirming the deaths before a spot visit.        
	The personnel were moved in with extreme caution as Koilibeda is located in an isolated and rebel-hit area. Instead of rushing to the spot on Wednesday itself, the force began their journey on Thursday morning and reached the village in the morning today.         
	After talking to villagers, the team established that all eight members of Vishwakarmas family were alive. Police spoke with Vishwakarmas wife and daughter, both supposedly butchered by Maoists. Police are interrogating the members to establish why Vishwakarma chose to misguide us, Yadav said.        
	Sources said either the man was a member of a Maoist group or was threatened by rebels. Either way, the rebel hand is clear in the case.         
	It was a well-planned attempt to ambush us and inflict casualty before I-Day, said inspector-general (headquarters) R.K. Vij.         
	The personnel, however, had taken all precaution before proceeding to the village, he added.

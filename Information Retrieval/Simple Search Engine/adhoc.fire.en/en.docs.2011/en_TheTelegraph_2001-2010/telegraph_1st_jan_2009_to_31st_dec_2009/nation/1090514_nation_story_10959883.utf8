The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Court respite for mongrel
                                                                                                               Court respite for mongrel
                            
	Purnia (Bihar), May 13 (PTI): A dog, which was required to appear before a Purnea court along with its owner in a case of breaching peace of Tatmatoli locality of the town area, got a reprieve from making rounds of the courtroom after the case was dropped.        
	Sub-divisional officer (SDO) Ashwini Dattatrey Thackeray yesterday dropped the case against Chhotus mistress, Raj Kumari Devi, on the ground that the time frame fixed, under Section 107 of the CrPC, for the case hearing had expired.        
	The six-month time-frame has already expired in the case and hence the case was being dropped against Raj Kumari Devi, the SDO said in his order.        
	The case has been dropped on technical grounds as it was never heard on its merit. Its hearing has been deferred umpteen times during floods and elections since its filing in July 2008, counsel for the dog and its mistress, Dilip Kumar Dipak, said.        
	The court had earlier ordered that the mongrel should be produced on every date along with its mistress, but since the case stood no longer, the pet would not be required to appear in the court, the counsel said.

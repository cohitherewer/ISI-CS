The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | glory of green dust   Change is in Calcutta air
                                                                                                               Glory of green dust     Change is in Calcutta air
                                                  A Trinamul supporter flashes the victory sign in Calcutta on Saturday. Picture by Pabitra Das      
	Now that Mamata Banerjee and the Congress have pulled it off, change must be here.         
	What did it look like on Day One?         
	Mamata Banerjee looked the same. The same crushed sari. She ended a TV interview mentioning a Tagore song: Amar matha noto kore dao he tomar chorono dhular pore (bow my head upon the dust of your feet).         
	If Didi means change, she didnt look it outside.         
	But other things looked quite different.         
	For the first time in 32 years, publisher Khokon Patra has won a five-year sponsorship of his coffee at Coffee House. Patra is sitting at Coffee House and is jubilant because he has won a bet with his friend, retired gynaecologist Jayanta Ray. Patra had predicted the Trinamul-Congress alliance would win 22 or more of the 42 seats in Bengal. Ray had said they wouldnt even touch 20. Ray now has to treat Patra to coffee at Coffee House till the next general election.        
	Patra was a former CPM supporter, now he doesnt identify with the Left.         
	For the first time since they have been around, Trinamul supporters advanced like an army in the city as their rivals retreated from counting centres.         
	Its 9.10am, in front of Chandpal Ghat, near Netaji Indoor Stadium, the counting centre for Calcutta North, where the contestants are Mohammad Selim of the CPM and Sudip Bandyopadhyay of Trinamul. Number of CPM supporters: 12, number of Trinamul supporters: 23.        
	Its 11am. Bandyopadhyay has a firm lead of over 40,000. Trinamul supporters have started growing in number. Only seven CPM supporters are standing under a tree.        
	Its 1pm, and its all over. Two CPM supporters leave on a motorbike while three board a bus. Before leaving, they dig in the party flags at the base of the tree and abandon another at a roadside tea shop, which falls into a puddle.        
	But 1,500 Trinamul supporters have gathered near the Netaji Indoor Stadium gate, breaking three barricades, chanting slogans for their party, Mamata Banerjee, Sudip Bandyopadhyay, Debashis Sen and the BSF jawans.        
	For the first time in many years, a Bengal party has got an artist for a spokesperson. We have seen how Mamata Banerjee has opposed the arrogance of the government. This may be an indication of what to expect in the next Assembly election, said artist Suvaprasanna.        
	For the first time in many years, the Trinamul will party like this.         
	Kunwar Singh Azad, a Trinamul supporter, has ordered 100 haris of rosogolla from KC Das and 50 packets of sandesh from Nakur. I have also ordered a 100-pound cake from Kathleen, and will present it to Mamata Banerjee and Sudip Bandopadhyay, who will cut it in the evening.         
	For the first time ever, so much green abir was seen on Calcutta streets. Who were the manufacturers?         
	For the first time ever, Trinamul bandannas seem to have become a fashion statement.         
	For the first time ever, theres such expectation from Mamata.         
	The mood is upbeat among students of Calcutta Medical College and Hospital.         
	The Trinamul deserve a chance to prove themselves. The time between now and the next Assembly election will determine whether Trinamul is capable of ruling Bengal, says Tanmoy Biswas, a final-year student.         
	The CPM had become like an unshakeable establishment in Bengal in the last 32 years. Democracy was getting eroded. Bengal needs a change and today the only alternative is Mamata. So, if she can provide that change, I dont mind her becoming chief minister, says Ratul Banerjee, another final-year student.         
	All change is not growth. But Didi, a lot depends on you.                    TAMAGHNA BANERJEE AND SAMHITA CHAKRABORTY LAHIRI IN CALCUTTA

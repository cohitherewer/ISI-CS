The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Headley visa mystery deepens 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Headley visa mystery deepens 
          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 17: The Centre today tied itself in knots over the alleged disappearance of the visa documents of terror suspects David Headley and Tahawwur Rana from the Chicago consulate.        
	The foreign ministry said it would not be accurate to conclude that these visa applications are missing. The home ministry took a similar line, hinting the visa papers were not missing but were probably lost in the pile of documents at the consulate.        
	The statements capped a day of conflicting versions, starting with foreign minister S.M. Krishnas declaration in Parliament that a preliminary inquiry was on. Later, junior minister Shashi Tharoor struck a different note, telling reporters that while Ranas papers were very much with the consulate, Headleys were yet to be traced.        
	Foreign secretary Nirupama Rao and home secretary G.K. Pillai said Chicago consular-general A.K. Attri had been asked to submit a factual report.         
	Not long after this, the consulate denied that the papers had disappeared, with Attri telling PTI the details of the papers had been given to the government.        
	Wife visit        
	Headleys alleged wife, a Moroccan woman, flew in from Pakistan and spent a night with him at Mumbais Taj hotel during one of his 2008 visits for the 26/11 recce, home ministry sources said. She came separately and stayed with him for just one night, an official said. Investigators suspect that the findings of the recce mission were conveyed to Headleys Lashkar-e-Toiba handlers in Pakistan through her.        
	The possibility emerged on a day the CIA said it had never engaged Headley, the denial following media reports suggesting the Pakistani American may have been a double agent. CIA spokesperson Marie E. Harf said: I cant comment on an ongoing investigation, but any suggestion that this individual worked for the CIA is flat wrong.        
	But a home ministry official said: He had an American connection, whatever it may have been, the CIA or the FBI or something else.        
	Indian officials cited how the FBI had failed to tell Delhi about Headleys visit to India in March this year.

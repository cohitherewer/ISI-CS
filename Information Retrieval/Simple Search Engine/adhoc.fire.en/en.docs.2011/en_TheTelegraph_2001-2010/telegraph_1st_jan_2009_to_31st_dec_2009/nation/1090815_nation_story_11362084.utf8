          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, Aug. 14: The Intermediate Reference Laboratory (IRL) at SCB Medical College Hospital, the only standardised laboratory in the state for testing drug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis, has received Centre accreditation, thus giving Orissa the final go-ahead to launch Dots+ strategy across the state.         
	Dots+ is the second line anti-TB treatment for such cases.         
	The state is expected to offer treatment for MDR-TB under the Dots+ strategy to patients as a part of the Centres plan to treat all TB cases by 2010.        
	MDR-TB is a strain that is resistant to at least two of the first and best anti-TB drugs  Isoniazid and Rifampicin  used to treat persons as a part of the Direct Observation Treatment Short Course Chemotherapy (Dots) under the Revised National Tuberculosis Programme (RNTCP) since 1997.        
	Currently, nearly 2,500 MDR-TB cases are reported in Orissa every year.

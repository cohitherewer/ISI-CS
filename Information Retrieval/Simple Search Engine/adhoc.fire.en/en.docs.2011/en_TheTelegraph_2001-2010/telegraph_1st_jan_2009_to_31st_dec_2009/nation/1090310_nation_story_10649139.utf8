	New Delhi, March 9: The Supreme Court has directed local authorities to make special provisions for preferential and concessional land allotment for the physically challenged in all schemes.        
	The court, however, stopped short of specifying what percentage of the allotment should be set aside, leaving it to the discretion of state governments.        
	The allotment could be for houses, offices and recreation centres for the disabled, lawyer Rohit Kumar Singh said.        
	Section 43 of the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995, mandates governments to do this (make such land allotments). Unfortunately, the authorities were not listening, Salil Chaturvedi, who had moved court to get the provision implemented, said.

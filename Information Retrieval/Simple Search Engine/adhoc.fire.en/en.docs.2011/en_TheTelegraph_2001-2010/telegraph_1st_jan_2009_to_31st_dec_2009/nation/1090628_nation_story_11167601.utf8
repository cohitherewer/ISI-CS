          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, June 27: The Chhattisgarh police recovered about 270 cartridges from a pond in Durg district yesterday evening, about 25km from the state capital. They suspect Maoists dumped the ammunition.         
	Sources said a villager found an unclaimed gunny bag lying in a pond in Charoda village of Durg district. The villager informed senior Congress leader Bhupesh Baghel, who was in the village on an official visit at that time.         
	When villagers opened the bag, they were stunned to find cartridges inside. Baghel immediately informed Durg SP Deepanshu Kabra, who rushed with senior police officers to the site. The cartridges are of 12 and 315 bore rifles, which are largely used by Maoists, Kabra said.         
	Baghel has demanded a CBI probe.

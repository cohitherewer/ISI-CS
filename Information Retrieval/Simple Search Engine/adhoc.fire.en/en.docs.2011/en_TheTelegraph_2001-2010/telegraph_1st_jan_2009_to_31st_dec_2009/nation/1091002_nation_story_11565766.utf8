          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 1: Home minister P. Chidambarams reference to the Indo-Tibet border at a media conference yesterday was a mistake, the ministry clarified today.        
	It is clarified that an inadvertent error had crept in, which is regretted. The reference was to the India-China border, a home ministry statement, issued by officer on special duty S.A. Rizvi, said in response to a report published in The Telegraph on Thursday.        
	Chidambaram, reading from written text, had referred to the completion of road construction on the India-China border during his monthly media briefing.        
	With the clarification, the home ministry has indicated that there is no change in the official line that Tibet is a part of China.

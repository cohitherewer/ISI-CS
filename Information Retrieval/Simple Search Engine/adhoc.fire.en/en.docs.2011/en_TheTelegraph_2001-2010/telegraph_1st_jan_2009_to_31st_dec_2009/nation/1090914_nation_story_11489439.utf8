          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 13: Trying to change an age-old custom, activists working for the cause of differently abled people have urged Puris Jagannath temple administration to allow wheelchairs into the 12th Century shrine.        
	The temple prohibits the entry of non-Hindus and people carrying leather articles, cameras, mobiles and, for some unknown reason, wheelchairs, into its premises. The practice is that family or servitors physically carry a devotee, if the person is unable to walk.        
	Talking to reporters today, Shruti Mohapatra, the country vice-president of Disabled Peoples International, leading the campaign, said: Thousands of pilgrims seeking darshan often return after listening to taunts of the servitors.        
	On October 2, activists have planned to hold a silent rally and start a campaign at Puri to press for their demand.         
	Siddhi Vinayak temple, Vaishno Devi Akshardham temple and Shridi Sai temple allows physically challenged person to enter on wheelchair. But, Jagannath temple is not the only temple that has a wheelchair bar.        
	A number of letters have been sent to the administration seeking permission. But, our requests has fallen to deaf ears, said Mohapatra, adding that wheelchairs are not made of leather. So, according to temple rules, there should ideally be no bar on them.         
	It is undignified and discomforting for a person with any form of disability to be carried by persons, she said.

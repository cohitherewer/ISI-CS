                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Defiant Koda arrested, BJP loses campaign weapon
          RUDRA BISWAS AMP; AMIT GUPTA                          Madhu Koda in Ranchi where he was brought after arrest on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	Ranchi, Nov. 30: The Jharkhand vigilance bureau today arrested Madhu Koda, robbing the BJP of its key weapon against the Congress two days before the second phase of voting in the state elections.        
	The former chief minister, who has been ducking summons from the enforcement directorate and the vigilance bureau on the pretext of campaigning, was arrested from his residence in Chaibasa in West Singhbhum district and remanded in 14 days judicial custody by a special vigilance court.        
	His former ministerial colleague, Kamlesh Singh, was arrested in Husseinabad in Palamau district and will be produced in court tomorrow. Both face charges of possessing assets disproportionate to their known sources of income, though Koda and his associates have also been charged under the Money Laundering Act for amassing wealth to the tune of Rs 2,000 crore.        
	Koda, brought to Ranchi in a bullet-proof car amid tight security in view of a 48-hour Maoist bandh that was to end at midnight tonight, was produced before the court of special judge (vigilance) Binoy Kant Khan.        
	Its an effort to keep me away from the elections, Koda said while coming out from the judges chamber, dressed in a white shirt, black sweater and a scarf and looking tired after the over five-hour journey. He was sent to Birsa Munda Jail in Ranchi.        
	The Congress, accused by rivals of having supported him in power, was quick to drop the Koda hot potato moments after his arrest was announced. We are committed to the law. The Congress has zero tolerance towards corruption, said information and broadcasting minister Ambika Soni in New Delhi. In Ranchi, state party chief Pradeep Balmuchu echoed the sentiment when he declared the party would have no truck with tainted leaders.        
	The BJP, however, dubbed the arrest an eyewash. Its MP from Jamshedpur and ex-chief minister, Arjun Munda, alleged that the arrest of Koda was drama being enacted at the behest of the Congress with an eye on the elections.        
	Former Union finance minister Yashwant Sinha said Kodas arrest was unlikely to benefit the Congress at the hustings.         
	The people of the state fully understand that the law has taken its own course and that the Congress had no role in it, Sinha, the BJP MP from Hazaribagh, said.        
	Voting will take place in 14 constituencies on Wednesday as part of the five-phase elections that end on December 18. The results will be declared on December 23.        
	 We had sought arrest warrants against Koda and Kamlesh Singh from the special vigilance court. Once the warrants were issued, they were despatched to the superintendents of police of Chaibasa and Palamau for execution, Neyaz Ahmad, director-general of police (vigilance), said.        
	The state vigilance bureau had summoned Koda for interrogation on December 4 after he failed to appear before it on November 27. Earlier, he had given the slip to officials of the Income Tax and Enforcement Directorate, who are probing the money laundering charges.        
	Koda has put up seven candidates, including his wife Geeta, in the elections. He has floated the Navnirman Morcha, a party that is yet to be registered.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sibal gears up for next 100 days
                                                                                                               Sibal gears up for next 100 days
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 10: Dont expect Kapil Sibal to slow down now that the first 100 days of this government are over.         
	The human resource development minister has asked his ministry to set internal targets for the next 100 days to avoid slackening off a zealous pace that has invited appreciation from the Prime Minister.         
	Sibal today showcased his ministrys work since the UPA returned to power, arguing he had fulfilled almost every promise he made when he took over.         
	We have achieved 100 per cent of our 100-day targets, he claimed, addressing a media briefing to place before the nation the first quarterly review of the UPAs flagship programmes, announced by the President. But yesterday, at a meeting with his officers to finalise the ministrys review presentation, Sibal declared that he wanted them to set fresh departmental targets to maintain the momentum.         
	Whats the plan for the next 100 days? Sibal is learnt to have asked his officers.         
	Sources indicated to The Telegraph that the targets which the ministry sets for itself for the next 100 days may not be unveiled publicly  unlike the promises for the first 100 days.         
	But Sibal, they said, is keen that bureaucrats work towards tough targets in order to retain the pace that has seen the ministry draft four promised laws and several policies over the past 100 days.        
	The ministry has drafted laws to set up a new overarching higher education regulatory body, create an independent accreditation regulator, start tribunals to resolve educational disputes, and to punish institutions that cheat students.         
	All these drafted laws have been circulated among stakeholders, and the bill to punish institutions that mislead students with false claims may be placed before the cabinet soon.         
	The ministry has initiated discussions with Muslim leaders and MPs on a proposed authority to regulate non-theological education at madarsas and formulated policies on areas of concern such as distance education and tackling faculty shortages.         
	Sibals ministry and the Central Board of Secondary Education have announced plans to make Class X board examinations optional for CBSE school students.         
	Parliament has also, in this period, passed the Right to Education Bill making schooling a fundamental right for all students between six and 14 years.         
	On Tuesday, Manmohan Singh publicly lauded Sibal and his deputy, Daggubati Purandeswari, as nation builders, referring to them as among the finest minds in this government.         
	But the HRD minister, it is learnt, has indicated to his bureaucracy that he wants them to maintain the tempo the ministry has picked up.         
	He said we should reach a stage where not working at this pace would trigger withdrawal symptoms, a source said.

                                                                                                               Swadeshi turn
          SANJAY K. JHA                          Advani                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 12: The BJP was back singing the swadeshi tune today, with L.K. Advani doing a virtual about-turn from what he had told Indias business leaders last year.        
	Swadeshi, re-interpreted creatively, is the answer, Advani told business chamber Ficci. The new (and) entrenched developmental challenges cannot be met by carrying the influence of either free-for-all capitalism or freedom-killing communism.        
	At the 2008 Ficci AGM, Advani had extolled liberalisation, recalling how the BJP had unhesitatingly backed Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh when they showed the courage to reverse Nehruvian policies.        
	Today, he said: Swadeshi means the centre of gravity of our economy must shift from India to Bharat  to agriculture, revitalisation of villages, small and medium enterprises, and unorganised and informal sector of the economy.

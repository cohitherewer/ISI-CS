The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | First in India: Sack advice against lady army officer
                                                                                                               First in India: Sack advice against lady army officer
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 11: The army has for the first time in India court-martialled a lady officer and recommended her dismissal for disobedience and on charges that she tried to frame her superiors by alleging they had harassed her.        
	A court of inquiry before the court martial had also concluded that Captain Poonam Kaur, of the 5682 battalion of the Army Service Corps (ASC), was a habitual offender and psychologically unfit to carry out her duties.        
	Kaurs lawyer, Colonel (retired) S.K. Aggarwal, said the court of inquiry that preceded the court martial had turned her, the complainant, into the accused.         
	He cited a case in Jalandhar, where a lady officers allegations of sexual harassment against her superior had been dismissed.        
	Kaur, 27, daughter of a retired army havildar, can challenge the court martial ruling in a civil court after the western army commander confirms it.        
	Another lady officer of the army, Major Dimple Singla, is also facing a court martial on corruption charges, but the proceedings against her are currently stalled.        
	In February 2006, Anjali Gupta, then a flying officer, was the first woman to be court-martialled and dismissed from the military in India.        
	Gupta  charged with indiscipline, insubordination and fraud though she had alleged that she was being framed  was with the air force.        
	In June 2006, a batchmate of Kaur, Lieutenant Susmita Chakravorty, also an officer of the Army Service Corps, committed suicide by shooting herself after snatching the rifle from a guard at the Northern Command headquarters in Udhampur.        
	Kaur was posted to the ASC unit in Kalka, Himachal Pradesh, in October 2007 after a stint in Misamari, Assam. In July last year, she accused her commanding officer, Colonel R.K. Sharma, the second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel Ajay Chawla, and adjutant, Major Suraj Bhan, of mental and physical harassment.        
	She also alleged that her mother, Hardev Kaur, and younger brother, were forced out of the accommodation given to her.        
	The army said Kaur had been granted quarters meant for married officers  though she was unmarried  on compassionate grounds.        
	Kaurs case was brought to the notice of the defence minister, A.K. Antony, after her mother went public. The minister ordered an independent inquiry that ran parallel to an army court of inquiry.        
	The army inquiry found that she objected to orders asking her to go to Pathankot to take charge of a detachment.        
	Kaur was to report to Pathankot on July 11 last year. She pleaded for an extra day to assume her responsibility but even on July 12 did not take charge.        
	Kaur made a representation to the ASC major general in the Western Command headquarters because, she said, she did not trust her immediate superiors. But, the army argued, when Major General Kamal Mohe visited Kalka, Kaur did not meet him.        
	The court of inquiry looked into her record of service and found that Kaur had complained against her superiors when she was posted in Misamari too, army sources said.        
	One of the 21 charges brought against Kaur was that she talked to the press. Another charge was that the officer had an affair in Pathankot with a driver, who is not an officer.        
	Aggarwal said the court martial, held in Patiala, found her guilty on 10 counts.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Train derails, adds to Metro jinx
                                                                                                               Train derails, adds to Metro jinx
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 12: A train on the trouble-scarred Delhi Metro derailed this afternoon but none of its 39 passengers was injured.        
	The incident came exactly a month after two back-to-back accidents in an under-construction Metro project, the first claiming six lives and the second leaving five labourers injured. A foreman was seriously hurt when a steel beam fell on him at another site two days ago.        
	Todays mishap, which occurred around 3.15pm at Dwarka, a terminal station in the citys south-west, was blamed on manual error that officials said happened because the driver had started the train without waiting for the signal. An inquiry has been ordered.         
	The train was moving at slow speed. He (the driver) should not have started at that time because there was no signal. He tried to jump the signal, Delhi Metro spokesperson Anuj Dayal said. The derailment of the train, bound for Yamuna Bank in central Delhi, took place only 10-15 metres from the Dwarka station.        
	The accident could have been more serious if the four front wheels of the first coach had derailed by more than the 6 inches that it did, officials said. In that case, the passengers may have been seriously injured.        
	Prima facie, the cause of the derailment appears to be the driver starting the train on the manual mode without waiting for ATP actualisation (after signal) and crossing the signal, Dayal said.         
	A PTI report quoted Dayal as saying this was the drivers first trip.         
	I heard a loud noise and saw people coming out of the train using emergency doors. Some concrete parts (from the pillars holding the overhead cables) also fell, Dilsukh Gehlot, a local, told PTI.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Patil nod for campus probe
                                                                                                               Patil nod for campus probe
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 18: Pratibha Patil has approved a CBI probe into alleged irregularities in the management of Nagaland University, taking the rare decision after an internal government inquiry found varsity officials guilty.        
	The President has also ordered the HRD ministry to issue a show-cause notice to vice-chancellor K. Kannan, under whom the administration is alleged to have spent crores to start new campuses without central sanction.        
	Government officials said the order would set in motion a series of disciplinary measures against Kannan and other key NU officials.        
	Kannan has denied the charges, calling them a conspiracy by people who want to run a parallel administration.        
	The HRD ministry, however, is likely to issue a show-cause notice to Kannan tomorrow, asking him to respond within a week, sources said.        
	The presidential approval for a CBI probe puts NU into a rare group of varsities run by Delhi that have had the agency prowling on their campus. In 2007, a CBI probe was ordered into the murder of a student at Aligarh Muslim University.        
	The Visitor (President) calling for the CBI probe is like a father asking the police to investigate his son. It is an indicator of the seriousness of the allegations, an HRD ministry official said.        
	NU Teachers Association president Rosemary Dzuvichu welcomed the order but feared Kannan might try to influence the CBI investigation.

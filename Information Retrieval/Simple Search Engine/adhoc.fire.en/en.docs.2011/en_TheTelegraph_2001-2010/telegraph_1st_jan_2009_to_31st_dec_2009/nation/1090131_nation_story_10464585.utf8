          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 30: Lalu Prasad today broke his silence on the Samajwadi Party teaming up with Kalyan Singh, a face of the Babri Masjid demolition.        
	I would not have accepted him, he told reporters after a meeting with Sonia Gandhi at 10 Janpath.         
	That should put Mulayam Singh Yadav on the backfoot as the Yadav leaders, along with Lok Janshakti Party chief Ram Vilas Paswan, were only recently looking at a grand alliance for the heartland states.        
	Asked if he thought Kalyan was guilty in the Babri demolition, Lalu Prasad pointed out that the former chief minister had been to jail for his role.         
	The comment should be a signal to the Congress that while it has not opposed the Samajwadis ties with Kalyan, the allies wont be happy.         
	The Congress has made it clear it believes Kalyan is guilty in the Babri demolition but has said the decision to join hands with him is the Samajwadi Partys internal matter.        
	Samajwadi general secretary Amar Singh spoke up for Kalyan again today, saying that if he was chief minister when Babri fell, the Congresss P.V. Narasimha Rao was the Prime Minister.         
	The RJD chief sought a clarification from the Congress on its leader Janardhan Dwivedis statement yesterday that there would not be a national alliance for the election. Lalu Prasad said he had an assurance from the Congress president that parties would contest the polls under the UPA umbrella.

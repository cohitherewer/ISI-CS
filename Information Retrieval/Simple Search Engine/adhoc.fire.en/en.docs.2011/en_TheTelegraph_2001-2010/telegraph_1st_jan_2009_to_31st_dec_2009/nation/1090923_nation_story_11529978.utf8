The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Visa sword over Chinese workers
                                                                                                               Visa sword over Chinese workers
          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 22: Thousands of Chinese workers may have to head home if the Centre stays firm that they cannot continue working in India too long without employment visas.        
	Beijing has sought more time from Delhi so that these Chinese employees can get their business visas converted to employment visas, a long-drawn process that can take up to a year. But Delhi has held out so far, although it has set no concrete deadlines on when the errant workers have to leave.        
	Chinese envoy Zhang Yan today called on home secretary G.K. Pillai to discuss the issue.        
	Only employment visas, issued by the home ministry, allow foreigners to draw regular salaries in India, but getting them is time-consuming.        
	So, some 25,000 Chinese are working in India on business visas, issued by the embassy in Beijing and valid for 60 days with a multiple-entry provision. Most of them are professionals, engaged in engineering and technical services in the petrochemical, power, gas and steel sectors, sources said.        
	Of them, only about 3,000 have applied for employment visas. The Chinese have asked that the remaining 22,000-odd, who continue to hold business visas, be given more time.        
	A senior home ministry official, however, said: The rest will have to go back.        
	He indicated that no deadline had been set yet.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Unexplained orbit shift for moon craft
                                                                                                               Unexplained orbit shift for moon craft
          G.S. MUDUR                           Chandrayaan-1                                  
	New Delhi, May 20: Indian space engineers have raised the orbit of Chandrayaan-1 from 100km to 200km above the lunar surface, taking the spacecraft away from what was intended to be its orbital home for two years.         
	Isro said today the orbit was raised after the successful completion of all major mission objectives, but mission scientists said significant amount of mapping and observational tasks remained incomplete.         
	Three scientists engaged in observing the moon using Chandrayaan-1s onboard instruments said they were unaware of the technical reasons that had necessitated the orbit-raising manoeuvre.         
	Indias first lunar orbiter, in orbit since November 2008, carries five Indian and five foreign-made scientific payloads.         
	The 200km orbit is stable and requires very little maintenance, and could thus help increase the life of the spacecraft, an Isro official said. We have completed one cycle of observations. Instead of repeating them from the same orbit, were going higher.         
	In the higher orbit, the spatial resolution  the size of the smallest detectable feature  of some payloads will change, showing less detail in images. The resolution is a measure of the ability of an instrument to capture fine detail  the smaller the resolution, the sharper the image.         
	An instrument for mineral mapping designed for a resolution of 80 metres will now be able to deliver images of resolution 160 metres from the higher altitude.         
	Isro did not specify why it decided to raise the orbit but merely stated that the higher orbit would enable studies on the gravitational field variations of the moon and mapping with a wider swathe.         
	Some scientists were speculating whether the change had anything to do with the heat the spacecraft had experienced in the 100km orbit. Several instruments were shut down in November for several weeks to prevent overheating.         
	The new orbit may make life easier for the spacecraft, said Martin Wieser, a scientist from the Swedish Institute of Space Physics, Sweden, who helped build a payload on Chandrayaan-1. The 100km (orbit) is inherently unstable and you need to make frequent corrections to stay in orbit.

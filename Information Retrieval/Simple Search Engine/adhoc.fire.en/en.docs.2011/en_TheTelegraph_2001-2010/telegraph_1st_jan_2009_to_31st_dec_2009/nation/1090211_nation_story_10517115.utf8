The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Konar sees a big challenge
                                                                                                               Konar sees a big challenge
          BISWAJIT ROY AND OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 10: CPM state secretary Biman Bose today downplayed the significance of a possible alliance between the Congress and the Trinamul Congress but another veteran conceded that it would pose a big challenge.        
	Her (Mamata Banerjees) claim that she has parted company with the NDA will be credible only when she formally writes to the NDA severing her ties, Bose said.        
	But Benoy Konar, a CPM state secretariat member, articulated the partys concern. It (todays development) represents a big challenge. There is no denying that there will be a rise in the Oppositions share of votes. But we will have to invent ways to counter this alliance and convince people why it is inimical to the interests of Bengal.        
	Konar said the Left would decide on a pre- and post-election approach to the Congress on the basis of the ground realities.         
	Observers said that in the event of the Congress and Trinamul coming together, the CPMs best bet lay in the same factors that soured a similar alliance in the 2001 Assembly polls.         
	In 2001, the official candidates of the combined Opposition were defeated in a large number of constituencies because of sabotage by those who had either felt ignored or had to vacate seats to accommodate new faces.         
	This year, another challenge before the Opposition will be the fallout of delimitation, which has led to large-scale geographical changes in constituencies.        
	Many constituencies now have thousands of new voters in areas unfamiliar to the leaders and workers of the two Opposition parties.        
	In contrast, the CPM and its allies are thought to have tracked the changes better.

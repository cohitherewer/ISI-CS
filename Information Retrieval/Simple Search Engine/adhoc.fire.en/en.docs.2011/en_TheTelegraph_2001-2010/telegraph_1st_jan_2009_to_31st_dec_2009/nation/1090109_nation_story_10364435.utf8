The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pranab push for PM Rahul
                                                                                                               Pranab push for PM Rahul
          OUR BUREAU                                                LK Advani, Rahul Gandhi: Grim and grin      
	Chennai/New Delhi, Jan. 8: The Congresss Pranab Mukherjee today said the day is not far off when 38-year-old Rahul Gandhi would be Prime Minister, even as the BJPs elders continued to squabble over who among them would be the partys candidate for the post.        
	Asked by a delegate at the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas about the prospects of young leaders, Mukherjee pointed out that Omar Abdullah had become chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir at 38 and, before him, Prafulla Kumar Mahanta had become chief minister of Assam when he was a postgraduate student. Rajiv Gandhi had taken over as Prime Minister when he was 40, Mukherjee added.         
	So the day is not far off when Rahul will follow in the footsteps of his father, the external affairs minister said in Chennai, triggering speculation whether this was a signal that the young Gandhi would be the partys candidate in the elections this year.        
	So far, the Congress has held that it will not project a prime ministerial candidate but that if it were to return to power, Manmohan Singh would be the natural choice.         
	After all, he is the incumbent with an unblemished image and acceptable to all, a cabinet minister said.         
	The Congress and the UPAs philosophy and programmes will be symbolised by the Manmohan-Sonia-Rahul triumvirate, sources said. Each of them represents unique attributes which are complimentary and not contradictory, a source said.        
	Sonia Gandhi had on August 15 made it clear Singh would be the partys choice for the post. The Prime Minister was asked if he would be back at Red Fort for the Independence Day address in 2009. Before he could respond, Sonia said: Certainly.        
	But Congress leaders have off and on tried to push Rahul for the post.         
	Party spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi suggested Rahul would be the partys face in 2009 when he commented on the tussle between L.K. Advani and Bhairon Singh Shekhawat on who should be the BJPs choice for Prime Minister. In a country where 70 per cent of voters were young, the spectacle of octogenarians jockeying for power even before they were within striking distance was unseemly, he said.         
	Those claiming to be in the know said Rahul was not inclined to become Prime Minister now, but that he would become a minister if the Congress were to return to power.         
	However, Congress sources admitted there would be a problem if they needed the Lefts support again  Prakash Karat and Singh are not best of friends. Then itll be interesting to see who the consensus candidate could be, a source said.

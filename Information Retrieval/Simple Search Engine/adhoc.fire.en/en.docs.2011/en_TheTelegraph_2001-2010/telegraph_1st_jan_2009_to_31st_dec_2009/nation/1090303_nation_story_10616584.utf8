	New Delhi, March 2: Slumdog Millionaires dream run isnt over: Jai ho and slumdog have aced the list of top Hollywords to have influenced the English language in 2008.        
	The catchy refrain from the Oscar-winning A.R. Rahman number and the word depicting a youngster from Mumbais poor underbelly have bagged the first and second slots on an annual list of top Hollywood words put out by a language monitoring group.        
	According to the Global Language Monitor website, Jai ho, translated as Let there be victory, comprehensively beat words like Hmong (a mountain tribe in Laos) from the Clint Eastwood movie Gran Torino, Nuke the Fridge from Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull and Twinkie defense from Milk.        
	2008 was a remarkable year for words in films, with a Hindi phrase, the name of a Laotian tribe, a West African drum, and a modified quotation from Frederick Nietzsche all making the list, the Global Language Monitor said in a release.        
	The monitor, which uses an algorithm to track the frequency of words and phrases in the print and electronic media, said it was rare for two words from the same movie to be ranked in its annual list.        
	The top Hollyword in 2007 was Call it, Friendo, from No Country for Old Men. The 2006 topper was High Five!!! Its sexy time! from Borat!        
	After doing the film festival rounds, Slumdog Millionaire initially had a limited North American release on November 12 last year.         
	After earning critical acclaim, it had a nationwide release in the UK on January 9 and in the US on January 23. It premiered in Mumbai on January 22.         
	Slumdog Millionaire won eight Academy awards, including the best picture award, last week.

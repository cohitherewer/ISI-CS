The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Chavan delivers but Deshmukh can give a scare

	New Delhi, Oct. 22: The battle for Maharashtra has been won, but the race is just beginning for the Congress-NCP.        
	If incumbent chief minister Ashok Chavan is delighted that the allies reached the halfway mark, the election result has dismayed other aspirants.        
	This, however, doesnt mean that Chavans coronation is certain as his rivals can still make the going tough for him.         
	Congress leaders in both Mumbai and Delhi agreed that the numbers had bolstered Chavans chances and he would be the high commands first choice. But they also said Vilasrao Deshmukh would emerge as a key player because he had the support of most MLAs and nursed ambitions of becoming chief minister for the third time.        
	If Sonia Gandhi expresses her reluctance to fall back on him, Deshmukh, sources said, could marshal all his resources to block Chavan.        
	Although many leaders said Chavan would eventually pull it off, they conceded this would happen only after a fierce internal tussle and deft political management by the high command.        
	If we go by strength, Chavan will finish last. But the high commands choice does matter a lot. Chavan has done well in the last few months, a senior leader said, summing up the mood.        
	A more experienced leader like Deshmukh would have been required in case we fell short of a majority. Now things have become much simpler.        
	Deshmukhs strategic alliance with the other powerful contender, Narayan Rane, can also make things difficult for Chavan. Sources said Deshmukh might finally settle for Rane as chief minister and a cabinet berth for his son Amit Deshmukh, a first-time MLA.         
	But this, they said, could be a difficult bargain as Rane, who has a Shiv Sena background and a mercurial temperament, faces an acute trust deficit with Sonia.        
	Rane has tried to keep a low profile in recent months and done everything to convince Sonia of his unflinching loyalty. If Deshmukh backs him firmly, it would be difficult for the high command to brush aside his claim, the sources said.        
	They pointed out that Deshmukh and Rane could count on the loyalty of at least 17 of the 30 rebel candidates who have won, apart from the majority support they enjoyed in the legislature party. The sources also said Deshmukh was determined to teach Chavan a lesson for his brazen attempts to sideline his supporters.        
	The Congresss internal dynamics apart, the NCP is unlikely to throw its lot behind Chavan. Party boss Sharad Pawar has personal reasons to oppose the chief minister as his father, S.B. Chavan, was his fiercest rival.        
	Although Deshmukh, too, is a staunch Pawar-baiter, sources said the NCP would prefer him to a younger and more determined Chavan. However, the biggest factor that goes in Chavans favour is his proximity to Rahul Gandhi.        
	Other contenders like Sushil Kumar Shinde carry the basic disadvantage of not being a Maratha. The Congress and the NCP are both dominated by Marathas and they dislike being ruled by a Scheduled Caste.        
	Shindes supporters are, however, trying to turn this handicap into his strength by arguing that the party should send a positive signal to Dalits ahead of the next big battle, the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections. But this may not prove to be a decisive factor as Shinde, despite his long political career, hardly enjoys any support among Dalits.        
	The leadership question is not the only issue tormenting the Congress leadership. They expect a bitter bargain with the NCP over portfolio distribution as the 50-50 formula for ministerial berths is being sought to be altered.         
	The Congress wants proportional representation in the ministry, which means lesser berths for the NCP, and also plans to snatch the important home portfolio from its partner.         
	These negotiations will require time and the next government may not come about before a week.

          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 20: 																								 University proposal to launch   a European studies centre has 
  divided sociologists, with   some suspecting a surreptit  ious initiative at a ldquo;neo-liber
  al rdquo; take-over of the universi  ty rsquo;s famed sociology depart  ment in its 50th year.
    
	The proposal to collaborate   with the European Union to   expand the sociological study 
  of that continent in India has   also attracted allegations that   the plan dismisses Indian sociology as not accommodative   enough of thought from other   countries.
    
	The project proposal ar  gues that sociology teaching   and research in this country   has traditionally been viewed   as India-centric.							   
	Over 570,000 euros or Rs 4   crore would be needed to start   the new centre. Under the pro  posal, approved by DU vice-  chancellor Deepak Pental, the   EU would be requested to fund   53 per cent of this investment. ldquo;This is terribly danger  ous. This proposal has the po  tential to adversely shape the   way future generations in In  dia study sociology, rdquo; said Vijay Singh, a member of the DU   academic council, the university rsquo;s highest academic au  thority.
    
	But proponents of the   move say these concerns are   unfounded and dismiss 
  allegations that   the project is being   pushed through in violation of   the standard rocedures relat   ing to the introduction of new   academic courses. ldquo;I disagree entirely that 
  this project negates the importance of Indian sociology or   accepts European sociology as   superior, rdquo; Rajni Palriwala,   head of DU rsquo;s sociology depart  ment, told The Telegraph.
    
	 ldquo;By opening up more to   Europe, we are trying to make   sure we do not repeat the mis
  take of the West in ignoring   work in other parts of the   world. rdquo;
    
	The DU sociology department, started in 1959 by   Mysore Narasimhachar Srinivas, one of India rsquo;s best-known   sociologists, has over he past   decades evolved into a leading 
  centre for the subject in the   country.
    
	Individual scholars and  faculty at the department have   in recent years worked on al
  ternative science and technol  ogy in Europe, studied second  ary schooling in France and   researched on the Dutch welfare state.
    
	But students have largely   had to depend on secondary   sources, such as texts, in their 
  study of Europe.  The proposal argues that   the ldquo;dearth of active collaboration rdquo; with European universities is hurting Indian sociology. It says students and faculty at the department need to   engage with European students and faculty to enrich   their understanding of European life and society.
    
	The department has for the   past few years been planning   to expand its repository of 
  books and research material   on Europe and the proposal   may provide the necessary
   financial and intellectual capital, Palriwala said.
    
	The plan involves using   the proposed European centre   to offer MPhil and PhD cours
  es to sociology students at the   department, and to other post  graduate students in DU colleges.
    
	A unique feature of the   programme, Palriwala said,   would be that the proposed 
  centre would bear all the   academic costs of the students.
    
	But some faculty members   in the department, and other   eminent sociologists from var
  ious parts of the country, have  criticised the proposal and the ldquo;opaque rdquo; manner in which, 
  they allege, the university approved it.
    
	A department faculty   member alleged that in a devi  ation from standard practice, 
  the proposal was not discussed in detail at faculty   meetings till recently. The 
  teacher also alleged that the   minutes of faculty meetings   under Palriwala did not 
  record dissenting views on the  proposal.  
	 Eminent Assamese sociologist Hiren Gohain has demanded an ldquo;intensive scruti
  ny rdquo; of the proposal before it is   placed before an EU panel next   month for funding support.
    
	 ldquo;What are those cutting-  edge theories (that the project   aims to introduce Indian 
  students to)? Will there be scope   to interrogate and examine   them critically? rdquo; Gohain has   asked in an email to a fellow   critic.
    
	Sociologist K. Gopal Iyer   too has expressed concern  about the proposal, and has 
  demanded that it be discussed at   the All India Sociological Conference.
    
	But Palriwala has argued   the proposal is not being   pushed through hurriedly. 
  ldquo;Not at all. Proper procedure   was followed in obtaining   sanction from the university.   Minutes of meetings generally only record outcomes, rdquo; she   said.

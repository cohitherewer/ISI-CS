                                                                                                               Govt to review panel report
                            
	Patna, Sept. 22 (PTI): Under attack from the Opposition on issues related to sharecroppers, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar today said his government would take a fresh view on the matter once a high-level committee, appointed to make suggestions on the issue, submitted its final report.        
	After receiving suggestions from the committee, we will decide what to do, he told reporters and added that the D. Bandopadhyay Commission had made several recommendations on land-related issues in Bihar, but the government had only endorsed suggestions on ceiling surplus land and bhudan land. The panel suggested 75 per cent share for sharecroppers in the yield and bank loans keeping the land they tilled as mortgage.         
	Nitish said the suggestions of the report related to tilling of land by sharecroppers had been handed over to a committee for vetting and suggestions. CDs of commission report was circulated among legislators in the monsoon session after cabinet approval, Nitish said today, adding that the action taken report from the government was also in the CD.        
	LJP president Ram Vilas Paswan yesterday had asked the government to clarify its stand on the report. A section of BJP leaders, including Rajya Sabha MP C.P. Thakur, were also of the opinion that the commissions report had caused fear among landowners and to a great extent spoiled NDAs performance in the recent bypolls to 18 Assembly seats.         
	But Nitish remains unfazed by the NDAs losses in the bye-elections. He said: I see the bypoll as a practice match we lost. JD(U)-BJP won six of the 18 seats.

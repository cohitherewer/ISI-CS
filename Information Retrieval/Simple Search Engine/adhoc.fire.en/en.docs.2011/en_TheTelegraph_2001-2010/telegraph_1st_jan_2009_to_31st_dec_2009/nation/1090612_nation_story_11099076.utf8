          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sonia Gandhi with Priyanka Vadra in Rae Bareli. (PTI)                                  
	Lucknow, June 11: Closed shops and petrol stations greeted Sonia Gandhi in Rae Bareli today as her thanksgiving trip to her constituency coincided with a traders bandh against power cuts.        
	The protesters did not intrude into Sonias path but stayed confined to the heart of the town as the Congress president, accompanied by daughter Priyanka Vadra, took the bypass from Fursatganj to Firoz Gandhi Degree College.        
	But the protest  aimed against the Mayavati government  was timed to draw Sonias attention, and local Congress leaders ensured it did.        
	The power cuts lengthened after the poll results. The people believe they are being punished for voting for Sonia Gandhi, claimed Raj Kumar Dikshit, a Congress secretary in Rae Bareli.        
	The Vyapar Mandal, a non-political body of traders that organised the protest, said the power cuts were causing huge losses to all traders  whether they owned factories, petrol stations or hotels.        
	Residents said the constituency received round-the-clock electricity during the polls but began witnessing power cuts for 4-6 hours immediately after the results and, since the last week of May, for over eight hours every day.        
	State officials said they were helpless  the Centre was not supplying enough power, and Rae Bareli was no worse off than other towns of similar size such as Ayodhya and Faizabad. We are following a common roster applicable to all districts like Rae Bareli, a power official said.        
	Sonia and Priyanka attended a closed-door meeting with local party leaders where they were told about the power cuts and the protest. Sonia promised to meet the traders during her next visit. This time I have been able to spend only 4-5 hours but the next time, I shall stay for 2-3 days and visit the villages too, she later told a gathering at the Firoz Gandhi Degree College.        
	Rae Bareli had no power for almost the entire duration of Sonias stay, except for a one-hour period from 1.30pm. The traders bandh was called off at 1pm.        
	Later, asked about the power situation by the media, Sonia said: I am aware of the problem and I would do the needful after consulting the energy department.

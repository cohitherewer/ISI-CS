          OUR BUREAU                      Farooq Abdullah shakes hands with players of the Jammu and Kashmir cricket team before the scheduled Ranji Trophy match in Srinagar on Tuesday. (PTI)                          
	Srinagar/New Delhi, Nov. 3: Next time a cricket team refuses to play in Kashmir, it can say even soldiers had chickened out.        
	An armed forces XI scheduled to play a Ranji Trophy match today at Sher-e-Kashmir stadium didnt turn up, apparently because of security reasons, drilling a hole in the armys claims that the situation in the state had returned to normal.        
	Services was to have taken on the hosts but kept officials, umpires and the rival players waiting for an hour and a half this morning before the Indian cricket board awarded the match to the state team.        
	The BCCI later disqualified Services  which includes soldiers of the army, navy and the air force  from this years Ranji Trophy.        
	The pullout  a setback for Kashmir which has been trying to get back on the international cricket map  came days after an under-22 state cricketer was detained in Bangalore on suspicion of carrying explosives in his kitbag. Parvez Rasool was freed after nothing incriminating was found.        
	Late this evening, the armed forces apologised for todays fiasco, which they blamed on a clerical misunderstanding, and requested fresh dates, apparently after an advisory from the Prime Ministers Office and discussions involving the defence minister and the army chief.         
	Sources said Farooq, too, had spoken to Manmohan Singh.         
	We have been in error. It was an administrative lapse. The Services Sports Control Board (SSCB) apologises to the BCCI, a defence source said. We are requesting fresh dates for the match.        
	The SSCB has apparently conveyed to the defence ministry and the BCCI that it was an administrative slip-up.        
	A PTI report, however, said the cricket board wouldnt lift the ban on Services despite the apology.        
	We have taken the decision to disqualify the Services team from playing in this years Ranji Trophy. Since the decision has already been taken we will not change it, BCCI spokesman Rajiv Shukla said.        
	Earlier, Farooq Abdullah, who heads the Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association, lashed out at the army.        
	There is a much larger picture attached to it: is Kashmir normal or not normal? Services are showing it is not normal. Then what the hell are they doing here, he fumed, in an apparent dig at the army that has been repeatedly claiming that the state had returned to normal after years of insurgency.        
	The Union minister blamed vested interests who wanted Kashmir to burn so they remain our masters, and called for a probe.         
	They (Services) have been advised not to come. It needs to be investigated who advised them not to come when everyone was here, including players and umpires. It negates the Prime Minister, defence minister and the home minister who said conditions are much better, Farooq said. I will take up the issue with the Prime Minister, home minister and the defence minister.        
	At the defence headquarters in South Block, the sense of embarrassment among serving officers was palpable. I know you media guys will write that the soldiers chickened out of playing cricket in Kashmir, said a senior officer. But there must have been a definite intelligence input  about a threat to the team or something.        
	Although officers argued that players security at the Kashmir stadium was the responsibility of the state police, the implications of the Services teams refusal to play were lost on none.        
	First, of course, is the inference that the armed forces are less than confident of guaranteeing security to their own team.        
	There is also a sense of unease over the flawed showcasing of Kashmir as a state where normality is returning.        
	Next time England or Australia or some other team refuses to play in India because of a terror threat, they will point to Kashmir and tell us even your soldiers are scared to play there, said an official in South Block.        
	The state cricket team plays Haryana next on November 10 at the same venue. The match is expected to go ahead as scheduled.

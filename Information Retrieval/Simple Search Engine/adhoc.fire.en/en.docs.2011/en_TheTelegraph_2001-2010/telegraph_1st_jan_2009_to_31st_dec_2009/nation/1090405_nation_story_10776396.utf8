	Sultanpur (Uttar Pradesh), April 4: Looks like Rahul Gandhi may not be able to return the favour a Dalit couple did him a while back. At least, not rightaway.        
	The Nehru-Gandhi scion, who had famously spent one night in a Dalit home in Amethi in January, today declared in his nomination papers that he did not own a house of his own.        
	Scrawled in the house/apartment column of his papers was the word: Nil.         
	Arriving in a shower of rose petals along with Sonia Gandhi to take a second shot at Amethi, Rahul declared that he owned movable and immovable assets worth Rs 2.25 crore, including farmhouses in Mehrauli and Faridabad.        
	According to the affidavit, the Indira Gandhi Farm House at Mehrauli in south Delhi was worth Rs 9.86 lakh on March 31, 2008. Rahul has an undemarcated share of 50 per cent in the property.        
	The second farmhouse, in Mauja-Hasanpur village in Haryanas Faridabad, is spread over six acres and is valued at Rs 28.22 lakh.        
	Among commercial properties Rahul owns are two ground-floor shops at Metropolitan Mall in Saket in New Delhi, estimated to be worth Rs 1.63 crore.        
	He has also declared Rs 70,000 in cash, besides Rs 7,744 in SBI, Rs 7.42 lakh in Citibank and Rs 3.41 lakh in HDFC Bank.        
	He does not hold bonds, debentures and shares, but has invested Rs 10.29 lakh in financial instruments such as National Savings Certificates and LIC policies.        
	An MPhil in Development Economics from Trinity College, Cambridge, Rahul does not own a car. But he has jewellery worth Rs 1.5 lakh and other assets worth Rs 7.29 lakh.        
	He also has declared a liability of Rs 23.35 lakh in the form of bank loans. According to the affidavit, he had taken a loan of Rs 70 lakh from HDFC, which was disbursed on December 15, 2006.        
	In the assessment year 2008-2009, he paid an income tax of Rs 11.20 lakh, sales tax of Rs 5,32,596 and property tax of Rs 97,115, the affidavit said.        
	Rahul was received warmly by the people, who strained to shake hands with him. Please vote for me again and help me contribute to the growth of the constituency, he said.

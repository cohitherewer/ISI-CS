	A bed-in with Youngos? Seminar with Bingos? Or perhaps an in-depth take on climate science with Ringos? Delegates face a bewildering range of people trying to sway their opinions. The talks hall can hold 15,000 people and is packed most days.  
	Indigenous activists in colourful traditional costumes wander past negotiators in sharp suits. Everyone who is anyone has an acronym. There are the youth non-governmental organisations (Youngos), business and industry non-governmental organisations (Bingos), and research and independent non-governmental organisations (Ringos).        
	Some dont have quite the same ring-, like Undrip, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples

	Green-faced extra-terrestrials with bouncy antennae wandered to the Japanese delegation and demanded: Take me to yourclimate leader.        
	The stunt by environmental group Avaaz.org comes as Japan grapples with setting its contribution to a fund to help poor nations badly exposed to climate damage.        
	Under the gaze of bemused Danish security guards, the aliens were admitted to the delegation office where they said they had come to deliver a warning from Planet B, destroyed by climate change. We have been searching all month for climate leaders, and today Japan is looking like our best hope, said a costumed ET

	The world should at least halve world greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, according to a draft text proposed by a chair of one of two main negotiating tracks on Friday.        
	The text, proposed by Michael Zammit Cutajar, says developed nations should take the lead with deep cuts by 2020 and 2050. The text offered a range for global cuts of either 50, 85 or 95 per cent by 2050 for leaders to decide on next week at a closing summit on December 18. Parties should collectively reduce global emissions by at least (50/85/95) per cent from 1990 levels by 2050 and should ensure that global emissions continue to decline thereafter, says the text

	Three US Senators have outlined a bipartisan framework for a climate bill to show solidarity with US negotiators in Copenhagen but details are sketchy. Democrat John Kerry, Republican Lindsey Graham and Independent Joe Lieberman aim to get a bill to cut emissions using a cap-and-trade system

	Think melting arctic ice caps are the biggest threat from global warming? Dangers to polar bears? Think again. To film director Michael Nash and others, bigger issues are national security and the prospect of millions of refugees displaced because of world weather changes.        
	Nashs documentary Climate Refugees will play for a private audience of leaders and scientists at Copenhagen. The film, looking at the human toll of warming, heads to its world premiere in January at Utahs Sundance Film Festival where climate change documentary An Inconvenient Truth debuted in 2006 before going on to box office success and Oscar glory.        
	The film shows how the coastalvillage of Kanhapura in Orissa has vanished. It also features Tuvalu

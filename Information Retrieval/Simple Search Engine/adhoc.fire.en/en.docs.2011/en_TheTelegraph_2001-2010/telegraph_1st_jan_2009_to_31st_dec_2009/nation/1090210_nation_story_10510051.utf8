The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Karat on Ambani
                                                                                                               Karat on Ambani
          JAYANTH JACOB                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 9: Bengal didnt figure in Mukesh Ambanis general discussion yesterday with Prakash Karat where the main theme was the economic slowdown.        
	Ambani discussed the present financial crisis and his ideas for the development of the country, the CPM general secretary told The Telegraph today while outlining the likely political alignments after the Lok Sabha elections this summer.        
	Ambani had expressed his desire to meet the CPM leader sometime back but sources said Karat wasnt able to find a convenient time for the Reliance Industries boss.        
	Karat felt there would not be a repeat of the 2004 polls after which the CPM had supported the Congress-led UPA. Instead, he spoke of the possibility of a repeat of 1996, when the United Front, a non-BJP secular government not led by the Congress, had come to power.        
	The CPM leader said: We will not support a Congress-led government. We are trying for a non-BJP, non-Congress government.

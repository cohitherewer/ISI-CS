The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Principal hauled up for roof collapse
                                                                                                               Principal hauled up for roof collapse
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, Feb. 20: A criminal case has been registered against principal of Konch Government Middle School Ram Swaroop Prasad, block education officer Mohammed Iqbal and against Rajiv Sharma and Kumari Savita, the president and secretary of the district education committee.         
	The case lodged under Sections 288 and 308 was registered after the roof of a classroom in the Konch school collapsed injuring 42 girls of Class VI and one teacher. Twenty-one injured girls are still being treated at the Anugrah Narain Magadh Medical College and Hospital in Gaya.         
	Whereas Section 288 deals with negligent conduct and carries six months of imprisonment, Section 308 deals with attempt to commit culpable homicide punishable with seven years in jail and is a non-bailable offence.         
	Tekari sub-divisional police officer Hari Shankar Kumar, confirming the case, added that no arrests have been as yet, as the accused are absconding. The incident has left the education department red-faced, as it comes a few weeks after teachers created a bonfire of textbooks (meant for distribution) to beat the cold in the same district. A case was registered after the book-burning incident, but no headway has been made into the case even after six weeks.         
	The roof collapsed at a time when a group of mentors of the Nalanda University project was to meet at Bodh Gaya, some 13km from the medical college and hospital where the injured girls are being treated. The mentors meeting venue was hastily changed.         
	Education of the girl child figures high on the list of priority of the Nitish Kumar government that has also introduced schemes such as cycle distribution.

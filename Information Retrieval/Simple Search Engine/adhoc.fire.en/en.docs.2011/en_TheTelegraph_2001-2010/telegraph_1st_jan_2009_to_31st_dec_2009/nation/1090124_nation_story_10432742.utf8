	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 23: Orientation of students should remain India-focused, rather than west-focused, said Atomic Energy Commission chairman Anil Kakodkar.        
	Addressing the 41st convocation of Utkal University here today, Kakodkar said: The domestic links between high level of research activity and its conversion into new innovative technologies can be nurtured only on the basis of such an orientation, as otherwise there is a continuing possibility of Indian brains contributing to western technologies with attendant higher costs in accessing them for domestic development. In many cases such technologies are not even appropriate to our needs and environment.        
	Stressing the need of building technologies out of our own knowledge pool within the country, Kakodkar said that if we remain dependent on foreign technologies, we can never become world leaders.         
	We cannot survive the global competition unless we achieve global leadership at least in some areas where we have strength, he said, adding: This is the challenge before our education system to produce empowered youths who can pull the country up the ladder and not baggage causing a drag to upward moment.        
	There can be no stopping of a large country like India from getting to top position once we are successful in creating an environment of learning that nurtures excellence in knowledge and its application, he said.        
	The Department of Atomic Energy has enhanced the budget of the board of nuclear sciences, which supports the research and development in university system several folds in the past few years to facilitate co-ordinated research of interest, he said.        
	India holds one of the largest human resource pools of experts in nuclear science and technologies and the countrys contribution to scientific publications in the area of pressurised heavy water reactors, fast breeder reactors and thorium utilisation technologies is quite large, he said.         
	We also need professionals for supporting the growth of our power programme which is destined to be an order of magnitude larger programme in coming decades, Kakodkar said, adding that the new exciting programmes should attract young scientists and engineers in larger numbers and thus bring in benefit in terms of comprehensive new technological capability in the country.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Three-pronged push for climate research
                                                                                                               Three-pronged push for climate research

	Bangalore, Oct. 18: The Indian Space Research Organisation plans to start the countrys first comprehensive climate research programme that will involve launching satellites to measure greenhouse gas emissions, setting up a dedicated institute and ramping up monitoring stations for Himalayan glaciers and forests.         
	The programme  to be planned and funded jointly by Isro and the Union ministry of environment and forests  is also aimed at reducing dependence on western data and comes amid Indias opposition to legal bindings on its emissions ahead of UN negotiations on climate change in Copenhagen this December.         
	Our aim will be to build a world-class institution which will be a data house for all issues relating to climate change, Jairam Ramesh, the Union minister for environment and forests, said.        
	Isro chairman G. Madhavan Nair today said the space agency would set up a National Institute of Climate and Environment (NICE), planned as a research centre, in Bangalore with around 100 scientists to synergise the work of various institutes.         
	This will be the second such institute dedicated to climate change studies. The department of earth sciences has just set up a Centre for Climate Change Research at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune.         
	Its very important to build local capacity  for instance, India would have to quantify how its (greenhouse gas) emissions change over time and well need expertise to do this, said Jayaraman Srinivasan, a senior atmospheric scientist at Bangalores Indian Institute of Science. Not many young scientists are opting for environmental sciences. Such institutions might help change that.         
	Isro, whose research groups are working on some 20 years archives of data on glaciers, water bodies and coastlines, says the NICE project will aim to expand existing infrastructure such as automated weather stations across the Himalayan ranges and monitoring stations in forests that act as a carbon sink.         
	We hope to initiate this activity in the current financial year, Nair said, adding that Isro would launch a micro-satellite next year to study aerosols (soot particles), followed by a comprehensive satellite, slated for launch in 2011, to monitor gases such as carbon dioxide and methane.        
	Ramesh stressed the need for local data and also said that Isro would be part of the negotiating team at Copenhagen to rebut scientific issues with scientific observations.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bhujbal junior set for water test
                                                                                                               Bhujbal junior set for water test
          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                          Pankaj Bhujbal                                  
	Nandgaon (Nashik), Oct. 8: Water holds the key for this dynasty scion whose political journey hasnt quite followed the usual script.         
	Having been humbled in his first foray five years ago, Pankaj Bhujbal hopes to be second time lucky, banking on the work done by his father  Maharashtra deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbal  in areas affected by drought.        
	Pankaj, unlike Vilasrao Deshmukhs son Amit and Sushil Kumar Shindes daughter Praniti, is not contesting from a constituency nursed by his father over the years. Instead, the 36-year-old Bhujbal scion, of the NCP, has opted for the newly created Nandgaon, which borders his fathers Yeola constituency.         
	Among the 50-odd kin of prominent politicians in the poll race, Pankaj, an engineer, is different from the other VIP children. He made his debut in 2004, but lost by a slender margin to the Shiv Senas Bala Nandgaonkar.         
	In 2004, the senior Bhujbal chose drought-prone Yeola in Nashik district as his base and brought substantial development to the constituency. As the public works minister in Vilasrao Deshmukhs government, Bhujbal funnelled in funds to change the face of the constituency starting with the basic need of the people  water for drinking and farming.         
	He also worked as the guardian minister for Nashik and created a launch pad for nephew Sameer Bhujbal, who became the MP from Nashik this May, and now his son.        
	Nandgaon constituency has been carved out of neighbouring Malegaon, Chandwad and Manmad and has an 80,000-strong Maratha population followed by 60,000 OBCs, 20,000 Muslims and 2,000 Sikhs.         
	Manmad is the second largest railway junction, has the largest warehouse of Food Corporation of India, and is the supply centre for petrol, diesel and kerosene to seven neighbouring districts. Yet, Manmad gets drinking water once in 12 days. People have to travel to Yeola, 25km away, for a good school. Roads and hospitals here are in poor shape, said Sameer, seated in an airconditioned conference room at Manmads plush Shree Leela Hotel, the base for the Bhujbal brothers as they pore over maps and constituency statistics.         
	The constituency faces seven hours of load-shedding and there is no water, said the first time MP.         
	While Sameer handles the backroom strategies, Pankaj has been busy doing padyatras, battling the Shiv Senas sitting MLA Sanjay Pawar, his principal opponent and a Maratha.         
	It is always difficult to fight a sitting MLA who knows the constituency well. My opponents tried using the Maratha card and sent text messages asking the community to unite against me, but they didnt get support. I covered 190 villages with the message of overall development, and it has negated any caste and party barriers. People expect me to replicate the development in Yeola, and I will work towards it, said Pankaj, who supervised the construction of the Yeola Rural Hospital in his fathers constituency.        
	Along with the hospital, the Bhujbals got Rs 9.64 crore sanctioned from the central government for improving water supply, created an industrial training institute, a sports complex, a boat club, a centre for promoting handmade Paithani saris made in Yeola and implemented what they call tehsil sachivalaya.         
	Like the Mantralaya, which houses all departments in one complex, we centralised all government offices in the tehsil in one complex built over 17 acres. Now people dont have to run from pillar to post to get their work done, said Sameer, getting ready for a rally for the NCPs Sharad Pawar, the only big leader who has visited the constituency so far.        
	Pankaj had no qualms about being the third family member to enter politics. People ask questions about that, but I chose Nandgaon because it is in dire need of development. I had offers from people of Sindhkheda, Vaijapur, Chandwad and Malegaon to contest from their constituency, too, said Pankaj, who, with Sameer, has been handling his fathers strong organisational network and Samata Parishad, a welfare organisation popular among the OBCs.        
	Nandgaon is one of the nine seats Raj Thackerays MNS is contesting among Nashiks 15 seats. But the Bhujbals dont seem to be unduly worried about MNS candidate Pankaj Khatal.         
	The development line we have taken is strong enough to counter any other factor. I dont expect a threat from the MNS. Women voters are strong here, and they say that even if their men vote for any party, they will vote for a Bhujbal, Pankaj said.

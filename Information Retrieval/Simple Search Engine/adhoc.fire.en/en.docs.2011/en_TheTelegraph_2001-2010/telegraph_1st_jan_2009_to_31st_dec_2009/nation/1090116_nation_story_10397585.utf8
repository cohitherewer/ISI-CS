The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP steps up heat on Soren
                                                                                                               BJP steps up heat on Soren
          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                          Shibu Soren at Apollo Hospital in Ranchi                                  
	Ranchi, Jan. 15: Jharkhand spent yet another day amid political uncertainty with caretaker chief minister Shibu Soren working the phones from his hospital bed to prevent the imposition of Presidents rule, while the BJP upped the ante by threatening to gherao Raj Bhavan tomorrow to pressure the governor into taking a decisive action.        
	Senior BJP leaders held meetings throughout the day to ensure tomorrows campaign was a success.         
	People are fed up with the impasse and development work or even routine functioning of the government had come to a halt. Instead of finding an amicable solution, the Centre was only promoting horse-trading, said leader of the Opposition Arjun Munda.        
	Therefore, the BJP has decided to gherao Raj Bhavan tomorrow and the agitation would be intensified throughout the state during the coming days, he added.        
	For Soren, who for all practical purposes was sticking to his stand of projecting Seraikela MLA Champai Soren as the JMMs choice of chief minister, had reason to cheer as the lone Forward Bloc MLA and minister of drinking water and sanitation and science and technology Aparna Sengupta came out in support of the JMM.        
	A Bloc delegation led by Sengupta met Governor Syed Sibtey Razi and said that though her party was with the UPA and favoured the formation of an alternative government, it disapproved of both the Congress and BJP.         
	Later talking to The Telegraph, she explained her stand, which effectively meant that the Bloc would not support a chief minister either from the BJP or the Congress though outside support from them was welcome.         
	She also urged the UPA to end the political impasse at the earliest.         
	Sources close to Soren said state Congress chief Pradip Kumar Balmuchu, who is camping in New Delhi, sent an emissary in the afternoon to request him to choose another person for the top job since Champai wasnt acceptable to the UPA partners.        
	Human resource development minister Bandhu Tirkey also sent in feelers to say that the RJD wanted two names for the chief ministers post other than Champais.         
	The state is steadily heading towards Presidents rule. The UPA leaders in Delhi want talks with Soren, but he is not willing to come. Under such circumstances, the Centre will be forced to take a unilateral decision, said Congress chief whip Niel Tirkey over telephone from Delhi.        
	Soren, who had few visitors today including Madhu Koda, Sudhir Mahto and wife Rupi, seems to have decided not to yield to any kind of pressure either from the Congress or the RJD.         
	His press adviser Shafiq Ansari, however, maintained that he still stood by his recommendation (Champai), but added that the JMM was fully prepared to face Presidents rule as well.         
	A communiqu from Apollo Hospital said Sorens condition was stable. His blood pressure was under control and he was feeling better.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, Oct. 10: An Andhra youth who had gone to New Zealand for higher studies has been untraced for the past nine days amid fears that he may have fallen victim to a racist attack.        
	Srikanth Rayadurgam had left home for college on October 1 but has not returned till date, his father told reporters in Hyderabad yesterday.        
	The familys anxiety has increased since authorities in New Zealand informed them that some personal belongings of the hotel management student, such as his wallet, mobile phone and a shoe, had been found by a cyclist.        
	The 23-year-olds mysterious disappearance comes after a series of unprovoked attacks on Indians in Australia, though the latest near a stadium saw the Indians retaliate and bash up two Australians.        
	The reports in New Zealand newspapers suspect it might be a racist attack, and we are worried, a member of Srikanths family said.        
	Srikanth, who graduated in hotel management from the Indian Institute of Culinary Arts in Begumpet, had left for New Zealand in February for an advanced diploma course at AUT University, Auckland. He had been staying with his sister R. Padma Priya and brother-in-law Nagesh Babu, who live there.        
	On October 1, around 1pm, my son left home for college but has not returned till date, his father Chakrapani Rayadurgam said yesterday.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          People wade through waterlogged streets after heavy rain in Patna on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	Patna, Aug. 24: Even as chief minister Nitish Kumar today reeled off the measures he was undertaking to tackle drought in 26 districts, the flood situation in the north worsened with swollen rivers inundating fresh areas.        
	We battled unprecedented floods last year. We face the possibility of battling worst drought after 1967 if the state fails to register required rainfall in September, Nitish said anxiously, adding: We succeeded in turning last years calamity into opportunity. We will tackle the drought situation similarly.        
	On the sidelines of the janata durbar, Nitish today told reporters that he interacted with the central team, which had surveyed the drought-hit districts recently. I apprised them of the states demand of Rs 23,000 crore to deal with the drought situation.        
	Nitish explained that the government had decided to give a quintal of foodgrain and Rs 250 each to drought-affected people, which will cost Rs 10,000 crore. I hope that the central team has assessed the situation properly and the Centre will come forward with adequate funds to our drought-hit state.        
	The government, he said, was chalking out plans to ensure fodder for the cattle in the drought-hit areas.         
	Meanwhile, three more people  two in Purnea and one in Darbhanga district  drowned yesterday, taking the toll in the current spell of floods in seven north Bihar districts to 14.         
	An official release said that swirling waters entered several villages under Terhagachhi, Bahadurganj, Dighabank, Kochadham and Potahi blocks of the Kishenganj district.         
	Over 50 villages were affected by floods under Palasi, Jokihat, Araria, Forbesganj and Kursakata block in Araria district. Many villages were submerged in Banmankhi and Krityanandnagar blocks in western Purnia by turbulent Kosi, which is being filled by waters descending from Nepal is under the spate these days.        
	Swirling waters of the Adhwara group of rivers inundated the national highway near Khirma village in Keoti block in Darbhanga district causing temporary suspension of traffic.

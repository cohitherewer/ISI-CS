The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Security amp; temple on Advanis agenda
                                                                                                               Security amp; temple on Advanis agenda
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Feb. 15: L.K. Advani today kicked off the BJPs Uttar Pradesh campaign in Gorakhpur, trashing the UPAs handling of internal security and lending his ear to supporters shouts of Jai Shri Ram.         
	Given the name of the rally  Rashtra Raksha Vijay Sankalp rally  it was clear that security would figure prominently in the BJP prime minister candidates speech. Advani said if the BJP came to power, the party would get rid of two things  jihadi terrorism and rampant corruption.        
	Turning his gun on Pakistan, he said Islamabad will have to probe the role of the ISI in the Mumbai attack. The Pakistan government recently claimed a few arrests have been made in the Mumbai terror attack case. The basic question is whether the role of the ISI has been probed in this attack. Unless the ISIs role is put under the scanner, this probe has no meaning, Advani said.         
	He alleged the Pakistani government had so far not even investigated the assassination of Benazir Bhutto and was also silent on the ISIs role. The government of India should not take the words of the Pakistani administration at face value. How can India value the so-called probe carried out there?         
	Security was on his lips but the supporters chants of Jai Shri Ram did not escape Advanis ears. Gathered in thousands, his audience had begun chanting the slogan. As if in reply, he said: The slogan of Jai Shri Ram can only be meaningful now after the construction of the Ram temple.                          
	Party president Rajnath Singh, who had invoked Ram at the BJP national council earlier this month, left Gorakhpeeth Dham, the venue, just when Advani began to speak. Rajnath, who had reached the rally spot before Advani, said he had to leave as he had to address a Dalit rally in New Delhi in the evening.        
	The UPAs perceived Muslim appeasement stance also came under fire. Advani said he was disgusted with the government for not hanging Afzal Guru, convicted in the Parliament attack case. The day we come to power at the Centre, we will not wait for a day to execute Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru. Till date Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has not given any reason for the delay in the execution of Afzal when even the Supreme Court has upheld capital punishment (awarded to him), he said.

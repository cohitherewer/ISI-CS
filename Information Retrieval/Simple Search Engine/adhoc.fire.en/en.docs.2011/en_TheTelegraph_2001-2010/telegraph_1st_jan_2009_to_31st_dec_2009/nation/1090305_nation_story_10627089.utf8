The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Centre clears acid attack air
                                                                                                               Centre clears acid attack air
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, March 4: Acid attacks can leave victims disfigured for life but they cannot be treated on a par with rape  at least, the home ministry thinks so.        
	The ministry has turned down a suggestion to insert a special section in the penal code to deal with increasing cases of acid attacks on women, insisting that existing laws were adequate to tackle the offence.        
	The Law Commission and the National Commission for Women had come up with the suggestion but the ministry said it would be difficult to equate a victim of (an) acid attack with a rape victim and that such offences could be stringently dealt with under Section 326.        
	The section deals with voluntarily causing grievous hurt by means of  any corrosive substance.        
	An affidavit, filed on behalf of the ministry in response to a court notice, conceded the need to curb all kinds of crime including crime of acid attacks but said there was no requirement of amendments to deal with such offences.        
	A Supreme Court bench had asked the government to examine a suggestion by the lawyer of an acid attack victim to insert a special provision dealing with such attacks.        
	The victim had spurned a marriage proposal, triggering the assault that left her badly disfigured even after four major reconstructive surgeries.        
	The Law Commission had said that Section 326 was not broad enough to cover all kinds of injuries and did not punish intentional throwing of acid if there was no injury.         
	But the home ministry insisted that Section 326, under which an accused can be jailed for life or sentenced for 10 years with a fine, was enough to deal with the offence. Section 307  attempt to murder  could also be invoked in cases of disfigurement, the ministry added. The maximum punishment under this section is life in jail.        
	The Centre also turned down a plea to put curbs on sale of acids. It said it would not be practicable to restrict free sale of acids or to make accessibility difficult since acids in different forms are used for many household purposes.         
	The affidavit said that since criminal law and criminal procedure were enumerated as entries on the concurrent list, the ministry had finalised its views after discussing the proposal to amend these laws with state governments and Union territories.        
	The ministry also claimed that the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill, 2006, now pending before Parliament, would address issues related to compensation and rehabilitation of acid attack victims.         
	Under this law, the affidavit said, state governments would draw up schemes for compensating victims and also take care of the social and psychological aspects of their rehabilitation.

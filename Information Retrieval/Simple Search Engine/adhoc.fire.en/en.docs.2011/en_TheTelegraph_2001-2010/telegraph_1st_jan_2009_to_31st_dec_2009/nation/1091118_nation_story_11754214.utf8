The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | RSS revival pill: Bharatiya Mamata Party
                                                                                    Wednesday , November 18 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            RSS revival pill: Bharatiya Mamata Party
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                              Mohanrao Bhagwat, Mamata Banerjee, Nitin Gadkari: A leaf from Trinamul?                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 17: If the RSS could rename the BJP, what would it be? Bharatiya Hindutva Party? Hindutva Dal? No. Bharatiya Trinamul Party, perhaps.         
	As the Sangh grapples with what seems like a long-drawn revamp job of its political progeny, a source privy to the exercise said the Sangh would ideally want to use elements of the Trinamul Congresss approach and strategy.         
	Our understanding is Mamata Banerjees entire focus is on building bricks at the grassroots by identifying peoples problems, the target of their anger, the people on the ground who could channel such feelings against the ruling coalition and grooming them into leaders. Unless the BJP sheds its top-heavy obsession with the Delhi leadership and puts the bricks in place, there is no hope. Trinamul is as loaded in symbolism as it is in substance.        
	However, unlike the Mamata-centred Trinamul, in the post-Rajnath Singh phase, the RSS wants a BJP that revolves around itself and, specifically, Sangh chief Mohanrao Bhagwat, not L.K. Advani or his proteges. Nor even the prospective president, Nitin Gadkari, who is likely to be seen more as Bhagwats alias.        
	The Sanghs view, not shared by many in the BJP, is that the cabal of four Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley, M. Venkaiah Naidu and Ananth Kumar  thwarted Rajnaths working. The implication is that they had foiled the Sanghs plan to take the BJP back to its roots, politically and ethically. The Sangh sees them as Delhi leaders out of touch with ground realities. BJP sources contested the perception, saying Jaitley had steered the party to victory as a general secretary in several state elections  Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Punjab. Sushma, earlier a Sangh favourite, was the biggest crowd-puller after Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the sources pointed out.        
	In an attempt to curtail the interventions of the four, the sources said the RSS planned to separate the party organisation from its parliamentary arm. The leaders, the sources said, would be at liberty to run the parliamentary party in whatever manner they liked but they would be expected to keep off the day-to-day running of the organisation.         
	The first casualty of the changes expected to kick in after Rajnaths imminent exit might be Kumar, the senior-most general secretary. The sources said the RSS hadnt taken too kindly to Kumars role in the recent Karnataka crisis as he was a detractor of chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa and was reportedly stalling a resolution for one reason or another. Egged on by Kumar, the sources said, the Reddy brothers of Bellary kept insisting that Yeddyurappa be replaced. The Sangh was opposed to the idea.         
	Bhagwat checkmated the ploy by iterating that the next BJP chief would be from outside Delhi and not one of the four. It was a message to the Bellary brothers that the power centre was shifting. They got the message and agreed to let the chief minister stay with some riders, the source said.        
	But in a sign that the Delhi four were not pushovers, Kumar was today inducted into an oversight committee set up by Rajnath to coordinate affairs between the BJP and the Karnataka government. Its other members are Yeddyurappa critics like Jagdish Shettar and K.S. Eswarappa.

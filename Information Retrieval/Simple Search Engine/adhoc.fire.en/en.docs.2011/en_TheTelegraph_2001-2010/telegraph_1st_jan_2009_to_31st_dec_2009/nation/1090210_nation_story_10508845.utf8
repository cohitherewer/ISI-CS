The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJPs return to Ram unites UPA
                                                                                                               BJPs return to Ram unites UPA
          NALIN VERMA                            New alliance: Ram Vilas Paswan, Lalu Prasad                                 
	Patna, Feb. 9: While the BJP move to bring the Ram temple issue back into spotlight has created fissures in the NDA, the same has worked as a catalyst in uniting warring UPA constituents.        
	We will not allow the BJP to build temples on the debris of the mosque, said Lok Janshakti Party chief Ram Vilas Paswan. He added: What next? The BJP will seek the demolition of Lal Quila and Taj Mahal.        
	In the same vein, Paswan added: We have no problems working with Lalu Prasads RJD. My only condition is that the LJP should be allowed to contest on at least 16 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar.        
	Senior NCP leader Tariq Anwar, too, landed in Bihar recently to announce that the UPA constituents should fight in unison, as the saffron party intents to break the social and communal harmony of the nation.         
	It is interesting to note that Paswan had officially maintained that his party would maintain a no liaison with either RJD or BJP route in the state ever since the 2005 Assembly election. He went to the extent of describing Lalu Prasad as an wound in the leg and the BJP as an wound in head, emphasising that both needed to be removed from public domain.        
	BJPs return to the Ram mantra has provided a pretext to the LJP to get close to secular RJD. The grapevine has it that Lalu Prasad and Paswan have been confabulating on the number of seats they would share in the coming Lok Sabha election. Lalu Prasad, while reacting to BJPs Nagpur conclave in which the party resorted to its Hindutva symbol, said: Munh mein Ram, bagal mein chhuri (Ram on lips and knife lurking in sleeves).        
	Asked how many seats RJD, LJP, Congress and NCP are willing to share among themselves, he said: It is not the time to discuss such matters before the media. What I can tell you is that we (UPA constituents) will get together and contest to defeat the communal forces.        
	When his attention was drawn towards Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, Lalu said: Unhi ke saath power mein baithe hue hain, aur apne ko alag bata rahe hain. He (Nitish) is sharing power with the BJP and describing himself as different. He ridiculed Nitishs remarks on the BJPs stand on Ram temple.        
	The NCP has only one seat at stake (Katihar) that Tariq Anwar had won in the past. Tariq is confident that the UPA will readily spare that Muslim dominated seat for him.         
	We are aware of our strength in Bihar. I am sure that the UPA will spare the seat in accordance with our strength.

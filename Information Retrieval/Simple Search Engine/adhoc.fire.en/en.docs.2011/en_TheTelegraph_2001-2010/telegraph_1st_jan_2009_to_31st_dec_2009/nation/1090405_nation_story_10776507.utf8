          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, April 4: Sharad Pawar is planning to share a platform with Naveen Patnaik and Left leaders at the launch of a joint campaign in Orissa on April 8, NCP officials said.        
	Pawar, the NCP chief, would join the Left and Patnaik in Bhubaneswar to dispel speculation that he may have buckled under Congress pressure to stay away from the Third Front, the officials added. The NCP and the Congress are allies in Maharashtra and Goa.        
	Pawar was scheduled to address a rally with the Orissa chief minister, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat and CPI chief A.B. Bardhan yesterday but did not turn up, citing a helicopter snag.

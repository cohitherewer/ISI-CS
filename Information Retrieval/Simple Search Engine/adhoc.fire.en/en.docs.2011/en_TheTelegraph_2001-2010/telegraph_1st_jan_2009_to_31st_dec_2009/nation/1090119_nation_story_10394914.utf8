          GAUTAM SARKAR                              
	Madhepura/Supaul, Jan. 18: Chief minister Nitish Kumar has only assurances to offer to flood victims, while several of them cry for food and medicines nearly five months after the Kosi calamity struck the region.        
	Victims have termed Nitishs visit to these two flood-ravaged districts last week a political gimmick. Nitish inaugurated the second phase of distribution of relief at Udhakushanganj in Madhepura last Wednesday. I have asked officials to investigate the alleged lapses and fraudulent acts by the persons concerned during distribution of relief among flood victims. R.K. Singh, the commissioner of crisis management unit, is probing it, Nitish said.        
	Raniya Devi, whose husband Mahendra Sharma (45) had died of starvation on January 2, was still hopeful, as some officials apparently told her that her plight would be taken care of soon.         
	A native of Bharatpur village under Lalganj panchayat at Chatapur block in Supaul district, the family lost everything in the floods. A landless daily wage labourer, Mahendra became sick in December and even after his death the family was not able to conduct his last rites. The family took shelter at a relief camp along the NH-57, but they were driven out in November, as the situation improved. Begging for two square meals a day was not sufficient for Mahendra and his family.         
	Supaul district magistrate N. Sarwan Kumar later asked Trivaniganj sub-divisional officer to conduct a probe in Mahendras starvation death.         
	Hundreds of families of Bhambra Tola, a colony of under-privileged communities located some 8km from Goalpara block in Madhepura, still spend chilly nights on makeshift bridges in their waterlogged fields. We have to cross precarious bamboo bridges to reach our villages, said Sitaram Rishidev, a villager.

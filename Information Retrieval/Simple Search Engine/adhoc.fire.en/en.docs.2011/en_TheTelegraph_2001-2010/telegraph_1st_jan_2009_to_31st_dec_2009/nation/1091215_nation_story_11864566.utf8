          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, Dec. 14: At least six armed criminals burgled cash and valuables worth around Rs 15 lakh from the house of a refuelling station owner Baiju Prasad Gupta last night.        
	In a complaint lodged with Kotwali police station, Gupta  also the district Congress treasurer  said that he was sitting with his friends when the criminals, some of them wearing masks, entered the house in a crowded locality on NH-83 and bolted it from inside.        
	The dacoits stuffed his family members in rooms and took Rs 8 lakh in cash, the sale proceeds of the last two days from the petrol pump owned by him near Bodh Gaya.        
	The dacoits also assaulted two persons, including the victims driver. The dacoits, according to Guptas complaint, also took away jewellery, cellphones and other movable valuables from the house. The entire operation was conducted in a carefree manner as the criminals remained in the house for nearly half an hour from 10pm.        
	Gaya superintendent of police Sushil Khopade said that they were trying to identify the gang for which sniffer dogs were put in service.         
	Fingerprint specialists have also been requisitioned and the team was likely to reach Gaya tomorrow. Khopade said that the injured two were discharged. The driver told the police that the criminals also possessed dagger/knife and one of the two injured persons had a cut mark on his palm.        
	Virtually ruling out any political dimension of the daredevil crime, he said that prima facie it appeared to be an act of pure crime. A similar dacoity committed in the White House locality of the town more than a year back remains unsolved.        
	District Congress chief Chiraghuddin Rahmani convened an emergent meeting, demanding immediate police action so that the culprits could be brought to justice. Rahmani also criticised the sushasan claims of chief minister Nitish Kumar.

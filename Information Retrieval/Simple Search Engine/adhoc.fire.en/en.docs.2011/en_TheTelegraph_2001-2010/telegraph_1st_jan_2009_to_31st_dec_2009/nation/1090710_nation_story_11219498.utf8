The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Legal leash on deemed varsities 
                                                                                                               Legal leash on deemed varsities 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, July 9: The University Grants Commission has ordered all deemed universities to legally commit that they will not violate any rules and will not issue misleading advertisements, holding out the threat of legal action for the first time.         
	The UGC has asked each deemed university to provide a legal undertaking that they will follow existing rules and not issue misleading statements, top commission officials said.         
	Human resource development minister Kapil Sibal has already announced that his ministry will introduce a law against educational malpractices  including misleading claims and capitation fees. The Telegraph had first reported plans for this law on June 15.         
	But the law, which is being drafted, will take time before it can be cleared bureaucratically and then by Parliament.        
	The UGCs demand for a legal undertaking, however, means that the government may have at least some legal teeth to prosecute deemed universities breaking rules or misleading students before a law comes into force.         
	In a letter to deemed universities  127 in all  the UGC has listed a set of norms that it fears are being violated, and then asks for a legal undertaking within a month of receiving the letter.         
	Unlike full-fledged universities, deemed universities are not allowed, under the UGC Act, to affiliate colleges or other higher educational institutions. But the HRD ministry has received many complaints that these deemed universities are indeed affiliating colleges.         
	According to complaints received by the ministry, several deemed universities are also starting off-campus centres, and distance education courses without obtaining required permission from the government.         
	Some of these centres are opened even in the absence of proper physical and academic infrastructure, the UGC letter says.         
	Several deemed universities also routinely issue advertisements making misleading claims.         
	The UGC Act at present empowers the commission to recommend to the HRD ministry withdrawal of the deemed university tag from institution found violating rules. But the UGC and the HRD ministry cannot seek prosecution under any law.         
	Misleading claims are not even covered by the UGC Act.         
	A legal undertaking will allow the UGC to seek action in a court of law against an institution that violated its commitment  amounting to perjury.         
	It will give us a weapon, which though much weaker than the proposed law against educational malpractices, does give us some teeth to target institutions wilfully cheating the country and its students, a senior commission official said.         
	Within a week of assuming office as HRD minister, Sibal ordered a probe into deemed universities.        
	During the five years under Arjun Singh, private deemed universities mushroomed on an unprecedented scale. Frequent allegations of corruption in the grant of the status swirled in the HRD ministry corridors especially over the past two years.         
	On April 28, The Telegraph first reported the governments decision to allow deemed universities to drop the prefix that distinguishes them from full-fledged universities, effectively allowing them to confuse students.         
	Junior HRD minister D. Purandeswari yesterday confirmed the decision before the Rajya Sabha, in response to a question based on this newspapers report.

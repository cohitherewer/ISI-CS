The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Delhi keen to pave Husain way
                                                                                                               Delhi keen to pave Husain way
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 31: The Centre will request the Supreme Court to speed up pending cases against M.F. Husain so that the painter might be able to return to India, a senior home ministry official said.        
	But Anil Relia, a friend of Husain, said the painter was sceptical about ever being able to return.        
	Husain left India in 2006, and now lives in London and Dubai, after several lawsuits were filed against him for his depiction of the Bharat Mata in the nude. The Supreme Court has thrown out three cases but four are still pending.        
	I heard the government is doing something but he is doubtful about the results, Relia told The Telegraph from Ahmedabad. He said the matter has perhaps gone too far, become too political for him to return to India.        
	Relia said Husain had spoken to him yesterday from London, where the painter has just showcased two 17ftx7ft paintings, together titled Indian Civilization, on political and social issues.        
	Husain flew to Qatar today and could not be contacted. He is preparing for a show in Qatars capital, Doha, and in New York, sources said.

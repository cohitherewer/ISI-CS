	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 27: Six pilgrims on their way to Kapilash, a religious centre, were killed after the jeep they were travelling in collided head-on with a truck coming from the opposite direction.        
	The mishap took place at 2am in Rairakhol, Sambalpur, early this morning. While six of them, including four women and a child, died on the spot, six others were found unconscious.         
	As many as 20 passengers were travelling in the jeep that skidded off the road after the collision. Such was the intensity of the accident that a few bodies had been thrown out of the jeep. The deceased were identified as Bilasini Bhoi, Bharkuli Bhoi, Dukhi Bhoi, Sanju Bhoi and her son Mukesh, and jeep driver Pintu. The jeep driver apparently lost control near NH-6, said the inspector in-charge of Rairakhol police station, Girishchandra Swain.        
	The injured were rushed to the district headquarters hospital and the bodies have been sent for autopsy, said Swain, adding that the truck driver managed to flee with his vehicle after the accident. Efforts are on to nab him, he said.         
	The passengers were on their way to Kapilash from Dhakara village of the district. The Indian Red Cross has extended a help of Rs 2,000 for each of the victims.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sadhus in tribal varsity tug of war
                                                                                                               Sadhus in tribal varsity tug of war
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 7: The outcome of a tug of war between two bands of sadhus may determine the final location of Indias first university dedicated to the study of tribal culture.         
	A year after education minister Arjun Singh laid the foundation stone for the Indira Gandhi National Tribal University at Amarkantak in Madhya Pradesh, land acquisition for the project is caught in a tussle over religious sentiments.         
	A sadhu samaj in the pilgrim town has opposed plans to grant land for the university in an adjoining forest tract, arguing that chopping trees would displease the gods.         
	It has written to both the state government, which has to provide the land, and the Centre, which is funding the project.         
	In mythology, when Lord Shiva destroyed Tripura (the three cities), the ashes of one of the cities fell at Amarkantak, transforming it into thousands of shivalingas.         
	The religious opposition to the project sparked concerns at the Centre  before human resource development ministry officials came up with what they believe is an apt solution.         
	The HRD ministry has now convinced a band of sadhus friendly to its cause, to write to Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, countering the charges of the opposing bunch of ascetics, The Telegraph has learnt.         
	It is unorthodox, but an apt solution, a ministry source said.         
	A suspicion has gripped some officials that the BJP government in the state has played a role in persuading the sadhu samaj to oppose the grant of land. If they can coax sadhus into stalling our project, we can do the same to get the university plan back on track, argued an official.         
	Urging the state government to release the land required for the central university, the sadhus friendly to the HRD ministry have argued in their letter that Amarkantak and Madhya Pradesh cannot afford to lose the project.         
	The idea of a tribal university was first mooted in 2005 by Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik, and accepted, in principle by Arjun.         
	Several north-eastern states and Jharkhand were also interested in receiving the university.         
	But the picturesque town of Amarkantak  where the Vindhyas and the Satpuras meet, and the Narmada and Sone rivers are born  was picked for the project, bringing Arjuns home state, Madhya Pradesh, the project.         
	Classes in select subjects started last year from a temporary campus. The HRD ministry has decided on opening campuses of the tribal university in other parts of the country, but is keen on keeping the headquarters in Amarkantak.                                 
	The tribal university is a much coveted project. If Madhya Pradesh doesnt want it, the university will have to be shifted elsewhere. The sadhus who share our concerns know that, a ministry official said.         
	The HRD ministry has also roped in a BJP member of Parliament, Dalpat Singh Paraste, in its attempts to obtain land for the tribal university.         
	Paraste is a tribal MP from the Shahdol constituency, which till recently included Amarkantak.

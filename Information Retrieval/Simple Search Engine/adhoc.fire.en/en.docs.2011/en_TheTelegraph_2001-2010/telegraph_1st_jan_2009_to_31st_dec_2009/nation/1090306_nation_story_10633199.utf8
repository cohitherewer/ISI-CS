The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Eye for an eye: whatever it takes
                                                                                                               Eye for an eye: whatever it takes
          CITHARA PAUL AND PRIYA ABRAHAM                          Ambika Soni                                  
	March 5: The Mahatma Gandhi memorabilia were apparently bought by Vijay Mallya at an auction in New York tonight, capping hours of drama that went against many ideals espoused by the Father of the Nation.        
	The personal effects were sold for $1.8 million, against the reserve price of $20,000 to $30,000, television channels reported around 2am (Indian time).        
	The sale to Mallya, who had bought Tipu Sultans sword in London and may hand over the Gandhi memorabilia to the Indian government, was reported a few hours after the collector agreed to withdraw the items but the auction house stuck to its guns.        
	At one point, unspecified threats were said to have been levelled at the American collector  it was not clear whether non-violence was involved.         
	At another point, a cabinet colleague quoted Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as having told her to do whatever possible to reclaim the Mahatmas personal effects. Again, it was not clear if the Prime Minister was being misquoted as whatever possible goes against the very essence of a concept cherished by Gandhi: the end does not justify the means.        
	It took forgotten Gandhians to inject some sense of sobriety. The Gandhians said that instead of the silly pursuit of the Mahatmas personal belongings  metal-rimmed glasses, a pocket watch, a pair of sandals and a plate and bowl  the country should try to follow and spread his core principles.        
	Its not the Zenith pocket watch or the steel-rimmed spectacles that are important but his ideals  the Mahatma changed his spectacles and watch a number of times, Gandhian Narayan Desai, 85, said in Bhubaneswar.        
	Gandhiji cared little for material things. He would have been happier had the government spent the money on the uplift of the poor than on getting those things back, said Gandhian philosopher K.P. Shankaran, almost echoing the spirit of the conditions set by the articles owner, James Otis.        
	I have always wondered why the Gandhi Museum has kept Gandhijis tooth on exhibition while his books are being paid scant attention, Shankaran, who guides the Gandhi Student Society, added.        
	Try telling that to tourism minister Ambika Soni who claimed the mandate to do whatever possible.        
	Earlier, the Centre also rejected the condition set by the five articles American owner to stop the auction  that India spend more on its poor  saying it infringed on the countrys sovereignty.        
	Soni said the memorabilia were tokens given to individuals in recognition of their Gandhian values, and the sale meant commercialisation.        
	Soni had told reporters: The Prime Minister has directed me to do whatever possible the bottom line is to procure the memorabilia. We will offer whatever it takes. We will enter the auction if required as a last resort.        
	But R.S. Nanda, professor of philosophy at St Stephens College, said: If Gandhiji had personally given away those items, what right do we have to demand them back? Besides, Gandhiji would have been happier if we had made a request instead of protesting.        
	Shankaran criticised the governments decision to bid: Gandhiji would have strongly objected to the government spending large amounts on silly issues like this.        
	Sociologist Deepankar Gupta said the Centres handling showed that it had lost its priorities and that India as a nation had not imbibed the philosophy of Gandhiji.        
	Instead of spending time and money on silly issues, he said, the Centre should have done something to create awareness of Gandhis ideals.                    
	This too was part of Otiss deal but no one would bet whether he was serious or not. The Californian peace activist and documentary maker had written to Indias consul-general Prabhu Dayal in New York, promising to donate the memorabilia to Delhi if it agreed to two conditions.        
	One, India must shift priorities from military spending to health care for the poor over the next decade. Two, it must promote events in 78 countries  one for each of Gandhis years alive  to promote Gandhian non-violent resistance and encourage the study of Gandhian non-violence.        
	Junior foreign minister Anand Sharma, however, said: The government cannot enter into agreements where it involves specific areas of allocation of resources. (Gandhi) would not have agreed to conditions.        
	If Gandhiji were alive, he would never get worked up over this like the government, Gupta said. The government is going to spend a huge sum on getting back those items in the name of national heritage even though most of our national monuments are getting destroyed because of the governments laxity.        
	Gandhian Purushottam Aggarwal, though, felt the government should try to bring back the Mahatmas belongings because they have great symbolic value. But he added: Of course, it should not go overboard this should not be done at any cost.        
	Gandhian activist Dilip Simeon found the controversy quite silly and said he didnt want to be part of it.

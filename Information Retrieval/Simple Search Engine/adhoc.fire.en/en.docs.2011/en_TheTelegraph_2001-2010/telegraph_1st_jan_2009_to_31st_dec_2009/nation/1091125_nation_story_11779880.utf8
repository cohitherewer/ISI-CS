          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          CPM general secretary Prakash Karat and Bengal agriculture minister Naren De in Bhubaneswar on Tuesday. (Sanjib Mukherjee)                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 24: The Left today launched a campaign against price rise, farmer suicides and food insecurity, while criticising the Naveen Patnaik government for its anti-farmer and pro-MNC policies.        
	Six months ago, the Left had forged an electoral alliance with Naveen-led BJD after the regional party broke its 11-year-old tie with the BJP.        
	Addressing a joint rally in front of the Assembly here today, CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan alleged that the BJD government had failed to address the farmers problems forcing 36 of them to commit suicide in three months.        
	Though Orissa was full of rivers, the government had failed to provide irrigation to agricultural land. In western Orissa, water from Hirakud dam was being allotted more to industries than to farmers, said the CPI stalwart.        
	Bardhan also criticised Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for his surrender to dollar hegemony and said the Left would launch a campaign against the UPA governments pro-capitalist policy.        
	His CPM counterpart Prakash Karat also flayed Singh for his invitation to US capitalists to invest in retail business, banking and insurance sectors.        
	Karat blamed the liberal economic policy of the UPA government for the price-rise of essential commodities and farmers woes. More than 2.5 lakh farmers had committed suicide in the past 10 years, he said. He also suggested following the Kerala model to address farmers woes. The Kerala government has enacted a law and constituted a commission for loan waiver of distressed farmers.

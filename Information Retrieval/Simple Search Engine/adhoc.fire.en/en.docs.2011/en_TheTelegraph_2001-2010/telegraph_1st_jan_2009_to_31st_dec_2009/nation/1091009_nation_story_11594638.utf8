          OUR BUREAU AND PTI                                        Mamata      
	New Delhi, Oct. 8 (Agencies): Mamata Banerjee today forced the Union cabinet to give an in-principle nod to lower the minimum qualification for semi-skilled and unskilled workers to Class VIII from Class X, a concession that will benefit her key constituency and lead to the recruitment of 47,000 people in the railways.        
	The Sixth Pay Commission had recommended the merger of Class D into C after raising the minimum educational qualification from Class VIII to Class X.        
	However, the railway minister today made a strong case for retaining the old eligibility for recruitment to Group D (now Group C) during the meeting, resisting implementation of the pay commission recommendations.        
	As a result of her forceful argument, the cabinet gave the go-ahead in principle for recruitment of around 47,000 personnel on the minimum qualification of Class VIII, a source in the railway ministry told PTI.        
	However, no announcement was made in this regard in view of the Assembly elections in Maharashtra, Haryana and Arunachal Pradesh.        
	The recruitment process was on hold because of the pay commission recommendations for the merger of the grades. If the cabinet decision goes through without a hitch, it will help Mamata fulfil a big campaign promise of finding jobs for youths and counter criticism that her politics of agitation had derailed employment opportunities.        
	The railways had sent a note to the cabinet requesting it to change its decision and grant permission to appoint workers in line with the criteria that existed before the pay commission submitted its recommendations.        
	Mamatas department is one of the worlds largest employers with over 14 lakh employees. More than 60,000 posts in Group C are lying vacant since the merger of the two grades.

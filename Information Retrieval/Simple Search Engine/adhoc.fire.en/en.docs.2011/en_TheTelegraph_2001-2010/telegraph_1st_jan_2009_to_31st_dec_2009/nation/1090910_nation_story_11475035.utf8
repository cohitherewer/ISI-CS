The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Obama taps Mahatma
                                                                                                               Obama taps Mahatma
          K.P. NAYAR                          Obama                                  
	Washington, Sept. 9: Embattled US President Barack Obama leaned on Mahatma Gandhi to be accepted by tens of thousands of American parents who vigorously objected to him directly addressing schoolchildren on the day they returned to studies after summer vacation.        
	Obama took the opportunity offered by a question from a ninth-grader at a school in Virginia to talk of how Mahatma Gandhi was an inspiration for him, of non-violence, of the Mahatmas influence on American history and on the movement for civil rights here.        
	The ninth-grader, Lilly, asked the president during the Q amp;A after Obama spoke to students at Wakefield High School in an address that was originally meant to be aired in every school across America: Hi. Im Lilly. And if you could have dinner with anyone, dead or alive, who would it be?        
	Obama replied: Dinner with anyone dead or alive? Well, you know, dead or alive, that is a pretty big list. You know, I think that it might be Gandhi, who is a real hero of mine. Now, it would probably be a really small meal because he didnt eat a lot, the President noted amidst peals of laughter from students in a country where obesity is major problem among boys and girls.        
	But he (Gandhi) is somebody who I find a lot of inspiration in. He inspired Dr. (Martin Luther) King, so if it hadnt been for the non-violent movement in India, you might not have seen the same non-violent movement for civil rights here in the United States. He inspired Csar Chvez (a Mexican American labour leader and civil rights activist), and he  and what was interesting was that he ended up doing so much and changing the world just by the power of his ethics, by his ability to change how people saw each other and saw themselves  and help people who thought they had no power realise that they had power, and then help people who had a lot of power realise that if all they are doing is oppressing people, then that is not a really good exercise of power, the President said, reducing big ideas into language that school children can comprehend.        
	So I am always interested in people who are able to bring about change, not through violence, not through money, but through the force of their personality and their ethical and moral stances. And that is somebody that I would love to sit down and talk to, Obama concluded.        
	Obamas 16-minute speech and 28-minute discussion with students afterwards had created a huge controversy since plans for the event were unveiled about a fortnight ago, exposing an ugly side of America.        
	It was clear judging from the geographical distribution of objecting parents and school districts that although nobody said so openly, many white parents and authorities did not want a black President talking to their children.        
	Racial and ideological rifts in American society, which appeared to have been papered over after Obamas historic election have forcefully resurfaced with the President pushing for health care reform and unveiling economic policies which conservatives view as socialism.        
	It is now common at rallies to explain health insurance reform to see protesters carrying pictures of Obama which are altered to sport a Hitler moustache or placards describing the president as a Nazi.        
	Worse, in some conservative states, local police have refused to arrest protesters arriving at Obamas rallies with loaded rifles and pistols on the ground that the US Constitution gives people the right to bear arms.        
	However, those carrying guns have been barred by the US Secret Service from actual spots where Obama is present because the premises occupied by the President at any given time are designated as federal territory under the direct control of the Secret Service.         
	Although Obamas speech to the students was to have been watched in every school, many school districts chose not to air it live in response to allegations from parents that the President was trying to brainwash their children with radical ideas.        
	Many schools, which aired the speech made arrangements to sequester students whose parents did not want them to watch the President in rooms where there was no television.        
	Under pressure, the White House released the text of Obamas prepared remarks a day earlier to assure parents and conservative school authorities that the president was not going to talk politics with young people.        
	In the end, it turned that Obama was motivational with school students, emphasising hard work and the need to overcome challenges. Replying to questions from students, he gave advice on how they could become Presidents and what it was like living in the White House.

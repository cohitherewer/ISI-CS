          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                    
	New Delhi, Dec. 27: Women and child development minister Krishna Tirath is writing to all chief ministers urging them to join the ambitious child protection scheme, frustrated over the governments failure to kickstart the plan.        
	In an internal note to her ministry, Tirath has accepted that progress on the Integrated Child Protection Scheme is not satisfactory, and has effectively questioned her own ministrys efforts, The Telegraph has learnt.        
	Tirath has also suggested involving the Prime Minister in the efforts to convince states to sign up for the scheme. In the note, dated December 18, Tirath has claimed she has been pushing her ministry to launch the scheme  part of the Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007-12)  since July.        
	But the note suggests that her ministry only gives her details of the schemes progress when she asks. Tirath, in the note, also asks what is the point of the scheme if the government cannot implement it.        
	Tiraths concerns come after the ministry failed to meet its own target of convincing all states to sign memorandums of understanding (MoUs) for the scheme by November 14. So far, such agreements have been signed only with Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Nagaland and Manipur.        
	Ministry sources said Bengal, Tripura, Assam and Goa had indicated their willingness to sign up but the agreement, essential for the scheme to be launched in those states, is yet to be finalised. Tirath now plans to write to all chief ministers, chief secretaries, and state women and child development ministers urging them to sign the MoUs soon.         
	The minister has also suggested to her ministry that she could write to the Prime Minister urging him to persuade chief ministers to sign up.        
	The scheme was incorporated in the Eleventh Plan as the governments response to the gruesome Nithari killings in December 2006. It consists of a series of measures aimed at improving and strengthening institutional structures, like childcare homes, and building a cadre of professionals trained in child protection.

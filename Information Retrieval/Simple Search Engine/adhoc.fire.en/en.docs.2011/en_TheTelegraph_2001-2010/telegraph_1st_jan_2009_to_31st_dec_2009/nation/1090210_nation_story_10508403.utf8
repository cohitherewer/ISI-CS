          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 9: Apparently terrified at seeing a new caretaker inside its cage, a spotted dear crashed into its rails and died today at the Nandankanan Zoo that has been forced to make do with volunteers in view of an ongong workers strike.        
	Thirty-four volunteers  all trainers from a forest guard training school and other voluntary organisations  were pressed into service after casual workers at the zoo launched an indefinite strike yesterday to pres for their demands that include regularisation of jobs, medical facilities and insurance benefits.        
	The 131 ground-level staff, though pained at hearing about the deers death, said they would not withdraw their agitation untill their demands were met.         
	They, however, blamed the zoo management for death of the deer. At least five animals died last week and the zoo authorities are responsible for it, said Nandankanan Pragatisheel Shramik Sangh general secretary Ramakant Nayak.        
	He said a deer, a blackbuck, a jaguar, a cheetah and a Royal Bengal tiger had died in the past seven days, and todays death raised the toll to six.        
	Zoo officials initially refused to comment on the figures. There has been no untoward incident on the zoo premises because of the strike, said Ajit Pattnaik, the zoo director. But eventually, he confirmed the death of four animals  two deer, the jaguar and Royal Bengal tiger  citing old age and not the volunteers as the reason.        
	The animals are like our children and it pains us to hear of them being mishandled by unknown men, leading to their death. We know the pulse of our animals and how they behave. No unknown person should be allowed to feed the animals in our absence, said Nayak.        
	While many animals were responding to the food served by the new volunteers, some had apparently stopped eating. While tortoises and snakes are taking food, crocodiles and alligators have been reacting against it, said Suvendu Behera of Snake Helpline. Some bears too had reportedly refused food.        
	The zoo has 20 permanent employees, who are at present manning the affairs, with the assistance of volunteers. The casual workerforce constitutes caretakers, cleaners, gardeners and security persons.

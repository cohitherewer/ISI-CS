The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Serial murder stench in Goa 
                                                                                                               Serial murder stench in Goa 
                            
	Panaji, Oct. 14 (PTI): Police found bodies of two children in a city creek this evening, taking the count to 10 over the past three days amid mounting fears that a serial killer might be lurking in the shadows of the Goa capital.        
	The morning had thrown up two more bodies  of a 35-year-old woman and a 50-year-old man  from the same creek.        
	Ten bodies have been found since Monday, seven of them of young women. All the bodies, three of them burnt apparently to destroy evidence, were found within a 30km radius of the city.         
	The police today set up two special teams to investigate the killings.        
	Superintendent of police, PRO, Atmaram Deshpande confirmed that the two bodies found this evening were of a seven-year-old boy and a four-year-old girl. He said the four victims may have been related to each other as the bodies were found on the same day and from the same spot.        
	The murders  months after the arrest of alleged serial killer Mahanand Naik who is accused of killing 18 young women  have sent ripples across the state ahead of the tourist season with the police not ruling out the hand of another serial killer.        
	We dont rule out the possibility of serial killing in these murders. In the case of Mahanand Naik, it was a systemic failure, which we are trying to mend, director-general of police B.S. Bassi said.        
	We have learnt lessons from the Mahanand case which will not be repeated. We are saddened, but at the same time Goa police have been doing a wonderful job in protecting people.        
	Records available with the police indicate that 18 people have been missing since the last fortnight. The state police chief said the deaths were being investigated from all possible angles.        
	Bassi, who was addressing a media conference with chief minister Digamber Kamat and home minister Ravi Naik, dismissed concerns that Goa was unsafe for women. Everyone is safe in Goa. Anyone can walk freely in Goa. There are no safety concerns that need to be raised, he said.        
	Similar concerns about safety had been raised earlier, too, after the murder of British teenager Scarlett Eden Keeling early last year.         
	A few months later, the mutilated body of a Russian girl was found on railway tracks.

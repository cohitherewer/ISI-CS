          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, July 30: A massive combing operation was launched by Keonjhar district police and Special Operation Group in Brahmanipal area following the death of a policeman at the hands of suspected Maoists last night.        
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik told the Assembly today that assistant sub-inspector Muralidhar Bastia and home guard Haribandhu Mohanta had been found injured near Tinkulia, some 6km from Brahamanipal beat-house under Daitari police station on Paradip-Daitari express highway.         
	They were rushed to the Tata Hospital where doctors declared them brought dead.        
	Quoting the preliminary investigation report, Naveen said Bastia had sustained a gunshot wound and injuries caused by sharp weapons, while Mohanta was hit by a blunt object. One empty bullet case was recovered from the spot.        
	Though no posters, flags or any literature were found, the possible involvement of Maoists is being investigated.        
	A case has been registered under Section 302 of the IPC and sections 25 and 27 of the Arms Act and investigation is on, he said. The murder of two unarmed personnel deserves condemnation. We shall take all steps to bring culprits to the book, he added.         
	The victims next of kin will receive compensation, ex gratia and a government job.         
	Earlier raising the issue, leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh expressed his concern over the growing instance of Maoist violence in the Orissa. How long will the policemen be made martyrs, he asked.         
	Supporting the demand, senior Congress legislator S.S. Saluja said the state should take precautionary measures especially during the martyrs week that began from July 25.

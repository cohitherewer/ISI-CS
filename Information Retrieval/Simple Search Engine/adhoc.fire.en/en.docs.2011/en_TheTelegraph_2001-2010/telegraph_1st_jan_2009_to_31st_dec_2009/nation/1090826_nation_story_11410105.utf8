          K.P. NAYAR                           External affairs minister SM Krishna, foreign secretary Nirupama Rao and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at the diplomats conclave in New Delhi. (PTI)                                        
	Washington, Aug. 25: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh put his foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon in an unenviable situation on July 16 at the end of his meeting with Pakistani Prime Minister Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani when he let Gilani outline the framework of their joint statement and then failed to make what Singhs critics would describe as corrective amendments to Pakistans formulations on Balochistan and terrorism.        
	The outlines of the joint statement, as proposed by Gilani to Menon and Pakistans foreign secretary Salman Bashir, were at odds with a draft that Menon had carried with him from New Delhi, according to those familiar with that draft.        
	Bashir had by and large rejected Menons draft during negotiations in Sharm-el-Sheikh in the two days preceding the prime ministerial summit.         
	This correspondent has been unable to confirm whether Singh had actually seen the original draft that was prepared in South Block as he was constantly travelling: to Italy from July 8 to 10, to France on July 13-14 and then to Egypt directly from France.         
	One can only surmise that the Prime Minister, who believes in delegation of work, left the original drafting to his minister for external affairs and the foreign secretary, who were in Sharm-el-Sheikh by the time Singh arrived there.         
	Very few people in the Indian delegation to Egypt are privy to what transpired at the end of the one-on-one meeting between the two Prime Ministers, but according to the sequence of events pieced together from accounts of those who know, Menon did not say a word to his Prime Minister or to Gilani, but left with Bashir to write the joint statement as directed by the two heads of government.         
	Those who defend Menon argue that he could not have done anything else. It would have been impertinence bordering on insubordination for the foreign secretary to even appear to have a difference of opinion with the Prime Minister in front of Gilani. And the two foreign secretaries were in a race against time to produce the joint statement.         
	But one question begs an answer. Why did India agree to any joint statement at all when not all previous Indo-Pak meetings have ended with a joint statement? Besides, in its final form, the Sharm-el-Sheikh joint statement is neither joint  as its differing interpretations in New Delhi and Islamabad showed  nor is it a statement in the conventional sense. It turned out to be merely a record of what the two Prime Ministers discussed.        
	Menon decided that it was discreet not to question what he was told to put into the joint statement because Singh, despite his genteel exterior, can be cutting when he needs to be, according to those who have worked closely with the Prime Minister over a long time.         
	When Singh had his first meeting with General Pervez Musharraf in New York in September 2004, his foreign minister, Natwar Singh, was one of the last to know that there would be a one-on-one meeting at the summit level before the delegation-level talks. Natwar objected to it with an intemperate that cannot be. The Prime Minister calmly but decisively cut his foreign minister to size by responding: Natwar, let me decide what can be and cannot be. End of discussion.         
	Years earlier, when he was finance minister, Manmohan Singh sent a file to South Block for an opinion from then external affairs minister Madhavsinh Solanki. Foreign secretary J.N. Dixit, who believed that he was both making foreign policy and running it, sent the file back to the finance ministry with his comments.         
	Singh wrote on the file that while he appreciated the foreign secretarys views, he would like to have an opinion from the external affairs minister. The file was returned to Dixit.        
	Days before his retirement, Menon had no desire to be pulled up by the Prime Minis-ter and hung out to dry. So he decided against speaking the truth to power as the memorable Quaker phrase coined during the Cold War went.         
	Defenders of the Prime Minister recall a joint news conference after he met Musharraf at the New York Palace hotel on September 14, 2005. The summit-level talks had broken down and Singh made a few grim remarks. Then Musharraf, hoping to repeat his nationally televised circus in Agra in 2001, began answering a question from a Pakistani journalist. The dictator-President was into his first sentence when Singh walked off the stage. Musharraf was forced to follow as he was in Indian space and Singh was the host.         
	The incident is being cited to show that the Prime Minister knows what he is doing and is no pushover. Singhs defenders insist that the Prime Minister has a clear game plan for eventually settling with Pakistan or at least having a continuous working relationship with Islamabad and that Balochistan and delinking terrorism from the Composite Dialogue are part of that plan.         
	However, these sources are not prepared to lay their cards on the table on the ground that it is premature.         
	Unfortunately for Singh, he does not have many supporters of any such strategy, at least as of now, with even some members of his cabinet harbouring reservations about any such plan.

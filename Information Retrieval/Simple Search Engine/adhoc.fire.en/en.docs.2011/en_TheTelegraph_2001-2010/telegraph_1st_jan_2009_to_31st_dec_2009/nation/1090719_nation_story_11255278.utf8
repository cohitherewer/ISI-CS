          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 19: Gandhi family loyalist and Uttarakhand governor B.L. Joshi will be the new occupant of the Lucknow Raj Bhavan at a time the Congress is emerging as Mayavatis main adversary.        
	Margaret Alva will replace Joshi in Dehra Dun  a virtual rehab for her after being sidelined since last year when she had alleged that party tickets for the Karnataka Assembly polls had been sold.        
	Alva was among four new governors announced tonight. Devendra Nath Dwivedi will replace Nawal Kishore Sharma in Gujarat where the Congress, as in Uttar Pradesh, is looking to make a comeback in the state elections.        
	The others are former Rajasthan chief minister Jagannath Pahadia, who replaces A.R. Kidwai in Haryana, and Iqbal Singh, a national secretary who will fill the vacant post in Puducherry.        
	The decision to pick party members rather than bureaucrats or police or army officers arose from a desire to reward the faithful instead of outsiders after the election victory. Sources said that when the perks of power were parcelled out in future, party members would get priority.        
	Also, the leaders felt that those who had spent a lifetime in the Congress must not be allowed to fall by the wayside in the sunset of their lives. However, neither Shivraj Patil nor Arjun Singh were on the list.        
	Sources said that while Arjun would be made to cool his heels for a while before being considered worthy of a position, Patil was still on Sonia Gandhis political radar. Both are Rajya Sabha MPs.        
	Jharkhand governor Syed Sibtey Razi goes to Assam whose governor Shiv Charan Mathur died recently. Nagaland governor Kattekkal Sankaranarayanan, who also held temporary charge of Assam, will come to Ranchi.        
	Joshis appointment came as a surprise to many in the Congress. He had served as the Lt Governor of Delhi and the governor of Meghalaya and Uttarakhand during the UPAs first term in power. Many expected him to retire and return to Rajasthan, his home state, because of his indifferent health.        
	However, given the caste equations in Uttar Pradesh and the perception that many Brahmins had returned to the Congress along with the Muslims during the general election, the dominant view was that a Brahmin should be sent to Lucknow as governor.

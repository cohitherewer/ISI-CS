                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      SC spurs sex workers to appeal

	New Delhi, Dec. 13: Sex workers have decided to appeal before high courts in five states for the first time see-king removal of certain clauses in the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, spurred by a Supreme Court remark urging legalisation of their trade.         
	The All India Network of Sex Workers, to which 18 sex workers organisations across 10 states are affiliated, has made the resolution of approaching the high courts in Delhi, Calcutta, Bangalore, Chennai and Mumbai.         
	The cases, to be filed simultaneously in January 2010, would cite police atrocities on the sex workers under the guise of some clauses in the act.         
	On December 9, in a striking remark, the bench of Justice Dalveer Bhandari and Justice A.K. Patnaik of the apex court said: They (sex workers) have been operating in one way or the other and nowhere in the world have they been able to curb it by legislation. In some cases, they are carr-ied out in a sophisticated manner. So why dont you legalise it?         
	S. Jana, a Calcutta-based activist and adviser to the All India Network of Sex Workers, said: We believe the Supreme Court is right in its observation and it is an encouragement for all the sex workers we have been working with. It is a fact that no amount of punitive action has or can prevent prostitution. This has only led to violence and criminalisation of the trade. For the first time, we are going to approach the high courts asking it to revoke certain sections under the act relating to eviction of sex workers, raids and rescue operations, soliciting and others.         
	Appearing for the government in the Supreme Court on December 9, solicitor- general said he would work on the issue and discuss it with various agencies before filing the governments opinion.         
	Legalising it (sex trade) will help curb the spread of HIV. Medical interventions can be a success when you decriminalise the trade, said Jana.         
	When the Centre can legalise gay sex, what prevents them from doing the same for prostitution? Thousands of poor women will benefit, said Khairati Lal Bhola, chief of the Bharatiya Patita Uddhar Sabha.         
	A recent government study has shown that the number of sex workers has risen from two million in 1997 to three million in 2003-04.         
	Many prostitutes were found to be children, enter- ing the sex trade as young as 12. Andhra Pradesh and Bengal together account for 26 per cent of the total num-ber of prostitutes in the country.         
	Sunidhi, a prostitute working in Delhi, said her organisation was fighting to make prostitution legal. On one hand police use force and violence against us. The society also discriminates against us because of our profession. All this violence and discrimination will end once our profession is legalised, she said.         
	Mrinal Kanti, a sex worker from Calcutta currently in Delhi to participate in a health conference, feels that there is a need to include various members of society in the sex workers network to facilitate awareness.         
	The All India Network of Sex Workers that meets every three months in different states has also decided to launch advocacy centres by January 2010 where they are planning to involve politicians and academics to speak for their cause.

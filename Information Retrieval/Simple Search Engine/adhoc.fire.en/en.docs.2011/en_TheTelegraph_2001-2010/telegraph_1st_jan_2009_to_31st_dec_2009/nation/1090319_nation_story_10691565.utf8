          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Keshava Rao                                  
	New Delhi, March 18: A day after ally Lalu Prasads put-down in Bihar, the Congress has hit back in next-door Jharkhand.        
	The party has left only two seats for Lalu Prasads RJD and nothing for Ram Vilas Paswans Lok Janshakti Party in a UPA seat-sharing arrangement for Jharkhand announced unilaterally today. The two allies had left just three seats for the Congress in Bihar yesterday.        
	The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) was an unwitting beneficiary of the spat, getting five seats, one more than what had been earmarked for it earlier.         
	The Congress has kept seven. It has thus pocketed an extra seat from the two given to the CPI in 2004 when the Left had an arrangement with the Congress and the RJD. Lalu was initially given to believe he would get three seats and the JMM four. The state has 14 Lok Sabha seats.        
	K. Keshava Rao, the Congress leader in charge of Jharkhand who announced the seats at a news conference, didnt say if the deal was meant to spite Lalu Prasad but left little doubt the RJD chief hadnt been fair.        
	Asked if Lalu Prasad had been handed his comeuppance, Rao said: It is a principled arrangement. We have given the sitting MPs their seats. We havent reacted to what happened in Bihar but they (the RJD) must learn to reciprocate. An alliance isnt a political business, its a meeting of minds and a true friendship to give a fight to forces inimical to our ideology.        
	Rao justified giving the LJP nothing, saying Paswan had no votes in the state as the Dalits had mostly backed Babulal Marandis Jharkhand Vikas Party in 2004.         
	Lalu Prasad and Paswan havent reacted to the Congresss riposte.        
	The Congress is now trying to salvage its alliances in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.         
	A meeting that went on until midnight yesterday among Congress leaders and NCP boss Sharad Pawars confidant, Union minister Praful Patel, is believed to have covered some ground. But loose ends need to be tied up, said a source. It wasnt clear if Pawar and Sonia Gandhi would meet to seal a deal.        
	In Tamil Nadu, the Congress is trying to bring the PMK and actor Vijayakanth on board the DMK. Central ministers from the state and Ghulam Nabi Azad, the general secretary in charge, are leading the efforts.        
	Asked why the Congress president wasnt appearing as pro-active on alliances as she was in 2004, a source said: There is no need. We have not deceived anyone. And for those who have let us down, we are not responsible for what happens to them during and after the elections.

                                                                                                               Rita gets interim bail
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Lucknow, July 18: A Moradabad court today granted interim bail to Rita Bahuguna Joshi, kicking off a debate if the charges slapped on the Uttar Pradesh Congress chief under a stringent law really applied to her.        
	Joshi, arrested under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, for alleged casteist remarks against chief minister Mayavati on Wednesday, will have to apply for regular bail on July 29 when the case comes up again.        
	The Congress leader was also booked under sections dealing with inflammatory speeches and abusive language after she reportedly said she would pay Mayavati Rs 1 crore when she gets raped while criticising the too little compensation of Rs 25,000 to rape victims.        
	Manoj Singh, an advocate with Allahabad High Court, said bail under these sections was difficult to get before a fortnight unless the process of levelling the charges or the basis of applying these sections was flawed legally.        
	Defence counsel R.M. Shukla drew the courts attention to a legal flaw in the FIR, which had been drawn up by a deputy superintendent of police in charge of the intelligence department, an officer not authorised to do so. Only officers attached to a police station can draw up FIRs.        
	The defence also cited the 59-year-old leaders ill health.

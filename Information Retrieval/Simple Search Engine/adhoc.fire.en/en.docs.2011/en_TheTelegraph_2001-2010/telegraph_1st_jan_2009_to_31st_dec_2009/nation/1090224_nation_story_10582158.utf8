The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Resul is us, the unknown Indian
                                                                                                               Resul is us, the unknown Indian
          SHYAM G. MENON                          Resul Pookutty exults with his trophy. (Reuters)                                  
	For long I had remained a fan of the movies, taken for granted in the country that produces the highest number of films. Kate Winslet, an actress from elsewhere, summed up my condition best.        
	In her acceptance speech at the Academy Awards, she recalled days when as a child she had gazed into the bathroom mirror, held a shampoo bottle in her hand and said thanks to a fictitious jury.        
	A lot of Indian film stars must have done the same thing. The difference is  Kate Winslet became an actress; our stars became the shampoo bottle. Literally so, for being a brand and endorsing products are what they aspire for. When have they acted? I now pay money to see a Bo-llywood film out of mere curiosity for the hype, not anticipation.        
	Minutes later, Robert De Niro struck relevance. While introducing Sean Penns best actor nomination, he said: Being a movie star can get in the way of acting; but not for Sean.        
	I dont have to tell you who all in Mumbai I was thinking of. Your guess is as good as mine for we are all the same audience, whose intelligence has been systematically trashed by coteries of actors and directors, ganging up with pliant media, to sell a product to carefully spliced markets.        
	Where else in the world do you have directors specialising in big fat weddings for an expatriate Indian audience? Elsewhere they would have remained wedding planners; here they are movie directors. I recall a TV news segment showing Bollywood stars offering their opinion on what actually turned out to be the best Bollywood film of the year  Slumdog Millionaire.        
	To reduce the noise in my life, I usually watch TV on mute. Even so, the words of superlative praise forming on the lips of the rich and the famous was easy to make out. What do you say of celebrities who are quick to praise Danny Boyle but lack the appetite to endure for art except to say that they slimmed or put on muscle for a role? I suppose a lot of film technicians and directors without inheritance suffer.         
	That is why I felt so much for Resul Pookutty. He was the unknown Indian, on stage to get an Oscar for excellence. He was us. He had none to sell him or hype him. Which adds to the lustre of the recognition awarded; like that much-delayed Oscar for Satyajit Ray.        
	You dont ask for it; you get it.        
	Having got it, Pookutty didnt forget to say for all of us, that it wasnt just another award, it was history.        
	To my mind, the music in Slumdog Millionaire wasnt A.R. Rahmans best. I dont care greatly for song and dance and certainly that last Jai Ho sequence in the film was a jarring end. Some sort of an afterthought to reinforce a Mumbai ambience. But then Rahmans work has been extensive and wide-ranging. I firmly believe his best is yet to come.        
	Switching to a news channel when Los Angeles took a commercial break, I heard Sudhir Mishra say that an angle often overlooked by viewers was Jamal Maliks character  a boy with the memory of an 80-year-old man. Good thought. It put a finger on a force making and breaking us in this congested, old country  memory.         
	As the best film was announced, my take-home from the Oscar show was the whole alchemy of Slumdog Millionaire and what that meant for me, living in India.         
	This film has had a magical run amidst a reality plagued by terror attacks; the volatility of an election year, violence against women and that constant irritation in the background  conservative religion.        
	While we were busy bickering and courting the absurd, a British director quietly assembled a cast of largely unknown Indians, filmed in Mumbai and brought home eight Oscars, with our citizens featuring in three categories.        
	I loved that. For a brief time at least, it should remind us of India.

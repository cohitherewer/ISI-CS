The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Politics? Rashmin wont mind
                                                                                                               Politics? Rashmin wont mind
          RITH BASU                                    
	Calcutta, May 16: Manmohan Singhs victory today inspired at least one young Calcuttan studying business administration to think of joining politics  his grandniece Rashmin Sahani.        
	The first-year student of St. Xaviers College had never seriously considered a career in politics till the election results came tumbling out of the television set this morning.        
	We expected the UPA to do well but this is beyond imagination. I am not absolutely certain yet but yes, I might join politics one day, she told The Telegraph, glued to the TV in her Behala Chowrasta home.        
	The 19-year-old was surrounded by her grandmother Gobind Kaur, 68, the elder of the Prime Ministers two sisters in Calcutta, her father Ravinder Pal Singh Sahani, mother Kuki and cousins Gundeep and Gulsheen.        
	The mood, tense when the counting began, had turned euphoric by 10am for the family that had settled in Calcutta in 1947 after moving here from Rawalpindi post-Partition.        
	I was absolutely sure my brother would win he has such a lot left to do for the country and the people have shown faith in his leadership, said Gobind Kaur, unable to suppress a smile.         
	We will offer a sukrane de ardaas (a prayer of thanks) at a gurdwara first, and then in a few days, invite some close relatives and friends to celebrate the win.        
	It was time for double celebration at the Parnasree home of Pritam Kaur, 62, the younger sister who lives 15 minutes away from Gobind Kar.        
	We couldnt have asked for a better anniversary present! Pritam and I were married on this day 46 years ago, beamed Manmohans proud brother-in-law Vidyarattan Singh.        
	The full family  Vidyarattan and Pritams two sons, daughter and grandchildren, Grusha Kaur, 10, Gurmann Kaur, 7, Pavnit, 12, and Japneet, 14  was cheering on their most famous member.        
	I hope this proves once and for all that Manmohan Singh is not a weak Prime Minister and that you dont have to get your pictures clicked working out in the gym to be strong, said Pritam Kaurs son Jasdeep about his maternal uncle.        
	The last time the countrys busiest brother spoke to his sisters was around two weeks ago, but Bhabhiji (his wife Gursharan Kaur) calls once every week and enquires about everyone individually, said Gobind Kaur.        
	As the UPA tally mounted and the congratulatory messages poured in, Gurneet Singh Chadha, 19, ditched his study room for the TV room.        
	Its great that the people here too have voted keeping in mind that they are choosing the Union government. The divisive power has lost and secularism has won, stated the first-year student of mass communication and videography at St Xaviers College.        
	So would Verdict 2009 nudge him, like cousin Rashmin, towards politics?        
	Thats not important on a day like today, the teenager smiled shyly.

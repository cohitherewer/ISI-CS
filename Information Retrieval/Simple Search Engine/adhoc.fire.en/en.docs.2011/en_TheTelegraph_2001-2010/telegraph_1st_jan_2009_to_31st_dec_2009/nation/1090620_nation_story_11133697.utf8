The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP MLAs stage walkout
                                                                                                               BJP MLAs stage walkout
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 19: The Opposition today stalled Assembly demanding discussion on yesterdays landmine blast engineered by Maoists that killed nine police personnel near Palur in Koraput.         
	Members stormed the well and shouted anti-government slogans, forcing six adjournments in 75 minutes, as the Speaker rejected their demand at all times. Earlier, the BJP had staged a walkout to protest against alleged government callousness towards the Maoist menace.        
	As soon as the proceedings began, Congresss S.S. Saluja wanted to raise a point of order that the Speaker disallowed. He asked Saluja to wait till the end of the question hour. As his pleas went unheeded, Saluja rushed to the well and sat on the table of an Assembly reporter to draw the attention of Speaker Pradip Kumar Amat, who continued to ignore him.         
	After the question hour, Congress members trooped into the well. Saluja said the government was asleep while Maoists went on a killing spree.         
	He flayed the chief minister for claiming that the situation was under control.         
	Referring to yesterdays blast, the Opposition said that the incident had demoralised the police force.         
	Stating that the Opposition had submitted a notice to discuss an adjournment motion on the issue, Opposition whip Prasad Harichandan demanded that the matter be taken up immediately.        
	However, the Speaker ignored his plea and called BJD member Pradeep Maharathy to raise other issues. He said the adjournment motion could not be taken up, as the chief minister was in Koraput.        
	Senior BJP leader and former minister Jaynarayan Mishra said the state was facing a volatile situation, reminding all of the killing of the Sambalpur sub-inspector three days ago.         
	Naveen Patnaik is reading out statements drafted by police officers and is skipping questions raised by us. We, therefore, do not want to participate in the proceedings, said Mishra.

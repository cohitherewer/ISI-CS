	Bangalore, Dec. 26: If riding a bus to office sounds unattractive for the upwardly mobile, how about catching one from a swanky mall that doubles as a bus station?        
	The city bus service in Bangalore, whose roads are chock-a-block with private cars, plans at least 35 large stations that will also be centres for shopping and perhaps entertainment. It hopes to get more working people to shun their cars, earn more revenue from rentals and, possibly, to make bus rides cheaper.        
	Some of the existing bus depots now house retail outlets such as Big Bazaar, but the new stations will also have large car parks to tempt people to get off their personal vehicles and take a bus to work.        
	A top official of the state-run Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation, the first to introduce a luxury bus service on city routes, said the stations had been planned as public-private partnerships (PPPs). The Traffic and Transit Management Centres (TTMCs), as they will be called, will come up mostly on land owned around the city by the transport corporation. The first 10 centres have been planned at a cost of Rs 440 crore.        
	Preliminary work is under way at the first one at Hebbal, a locality in north Bangalore near the international airport, which will have a built-up area of at least 2.5 million square feet.        
	The centres will be a one-stop shops, said Padam Kumar Garg, director (projects) with the corporation, one of Indias few profit-making state-run transport bodies. We are awaiting formal approval to float the tenders.        
	Garg said the Hebbal project had been planned on a design-build-own-operate-transfer basis.        
	The transport corporation runs services at several price levels but the occupancy is just 35 per cent on its most expensive service, run on Volvo buses that ply 58 routes including the IT corridors of Electronics City and Whitefield. In December, when the Volvo fares were slashed, the sale of monthly passes rose from 400 to 1,200.        
	The TTMCs were mooted two years ago under the Jawarharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. One such centre, built with central funding at Jayanagar, has been completed and eight others are in various stages of progress. They are expected to become operational in six to eight months, but will have smaller built-up areas than the 35 planned under PPPs.        
	The plan is to have at least Rs 500 crore of revenue from non-transport sources in three years time, said Garg, adding that this sector now contributed about 6-7 per cent of the total revenues. The transport corporation earned revenues of Rs 900 crore in the past fiscal, making a profit of Rs 53 crore, Garg said.        
	Up to 10-15 per cent (of the revenues) can be achieved (from non-transport sources) but the majority can only come from transport services, said R. Balasubramanian, director of the Central Institute of Road Transport, Pune.

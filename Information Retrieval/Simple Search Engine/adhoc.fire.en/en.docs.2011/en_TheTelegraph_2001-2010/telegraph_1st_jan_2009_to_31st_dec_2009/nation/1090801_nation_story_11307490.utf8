	New Delhi, July 31: An MBA, a former MLA, an ex-policeman, two leading jewellers and a former stockbroker here have one thing in common.        
	They are all behind bars for allegedly amassing crores by cheating thousands out of their hard-earned money, the victims possibly including Mumbai attack hero Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan.        
	Police records suggest Delhi is the countrys Con Capital, its residents swindled out of at least Rs 202 crore in the first six months of this year by frauds offering quick money-making schemes.        
	The latest to be arrested is Naveen Sharma, an MBA who allegedly made Rs 50 crore out of 2,500 clients. Police sources said a register maintained by Sharma had the names of several National Security Guard commandos and army and navy officers, including Major Unnikrishnan who died fighting the 26/11 terrorists.    
	Sharma, son of a former Delhi government employee, was arrested in Dehra Dun today with his wife and alleged accomplice.        
	Incidents of cheating have always been there in Delhi. This year, there has been a cluster of cases where multiple victims were affected. We will soon start an educational campaign to warn people against these scamsters, said Amulya Patnaik, joint commissioner of police (crime).        
	The portrait of the scamster emerging from the arrests is that of the educated family man using his knowledge to rob people.        
	Ranbir Singh Kharab, accused of duping investors out of Rs 100 crore in a chit fund scam, is a former Delhi legislator who waved his MLA card to lure victims. Ashok Jadeja allegedly convinced his clients he had miraculous powers to multiply cash.         
	Those arrested include two co-owners of a jewellery, former stockbroker Subhash Aggarwal and ex-policeman Virender Kumar.        
	Delhi polices economic offences wing (EOW), which only probes cases involving Rs 1 crore or more, registered 202 cases of cheating and fraud, mostly by fake finance companies, till June this year. Its a rise of 63 per cent over the 124 cases registered in last years first six months.        
	So far, around 250 people have approached the EOW with complaints against Sharma alone. Sharma operated as chairman of Money Mantra and Big Leap Multi Trade Ltd, a marketing scheme promising 10 per cent returns on investments.        
	The basic membership fee started from Rs 15,000, and the client was assured a return of Rs 1,000 per month for 36 months. Officials began tracking the racket after a complainant, Akshay Kumar Singh, alleged being swindled out of Rs 1.97 crore. Singh alleged Sharma had given him post-dated cheques that bounced.

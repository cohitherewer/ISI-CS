          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 13: Bengal industries minister Nirupam Sen today asked CPM cadres to focus on issues like price rise to pay the Congress-Trinamul Congress combine back in their own coin.        
	Sen, delivering the Promode Dasgupta memorial lecture, said: Those who went to the polls claiming to be the true Left are now in power at the Centre. They are bound to implement the neo-liberal economic policies attacking the toiling people. Price rise, loss of jobs and lack of employment will offer new opportunities to us and we must seize them.

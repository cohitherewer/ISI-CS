The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Comrade Papa, got number
                                                                                                               Comrade Papa, got number
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 9: So what the CPM didnt get the numbers, a party leaders son just drove away with the one he wanted.        
	Kerala home minister Kodiyeri Balakrishnans son Binoy Kodiyeri bid and won a fancy number  KL-01 AW 9  for his Toyota Innova at an auction held on Monday.        
	The bid cost him just Rs 1,200, but his participation in the auction has come at a time his fathers party  battered in the recent general election  is in the middle of a rectification campaign to address lifestyle deviations and bourgeois tendencies among comrades.        
	It doesnt help also that Kodiyeri Balakrishnan happens to be a member of the CPM politburo, the apex body of a party that swears by a frugal lifestyle.        
	CPM leaders refused comment on Binoys bid, saying they needed to check out the facts first.         
	Lifestyles of leaders and their families will come under greater scrutiny. But we are not aware of the specific case, said a central committee member.        
	Another leader said he was not aware of the development.        
	If Binoys bid makes central leaders sit up, critics can afford a smug smile at the single-digit number  a sort of status symbol in the state  as emblematic of the partys electoral fortunes.        
	The CPM won just three of the 20 Lok Sabha seats in Kerala in the last elections, down 10 from its 2004 tally.        
	In Bengal, also ruled by the Marxists, the party fared better with 15 seats of 42, but still 11 less from last time.         
	The dismal results led to suggestions that consumerist tendencies and unaccounted wealth of some local leaders were some of the factors that alienated voters in Kerala and Bengal, ending in the rough ride for the party.        
	For Binoy, however, it was a smooth run.        
	He drove away seven bidders, including film stars Mohanlal and Suresh Gopi and some industrialists, as they chose not to press for the fancy number.        
	Binoys bid also meant that the motor vehicles department lost some money.         
	Another number  KL 01 AW 1  put up for auction on the same day was bought by an industrialist for Rs 7 lakh.        
	But who would care for such petty profit, an official said, when the address of a bidder is TC 15/1397, Tagore Nagar, Vazhuthacaud, the official residence of the home minister in state capital Thiruvananthapuram.        
	Motor vehicles officials said a person could seek a number of his or her choice after paying a deposit of Rs 2,000. If more than one person sought the same number, it would be auctioned.         
	Actor Mohanlals representative and Suresh Gopis wife Radhika Suresh were among the eight bidders present at the auction but none pressed for the number 9 beyond cursory bids of Rs 200.

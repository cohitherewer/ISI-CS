The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mamata-Pawar neighbourly axis 
                                                                                                               Mamata-Pawar neighbourly axis 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           Mamata and Pawar: Moving closer?                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 24: The Congresss two major breakaway groups, the Trinamul Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party, are moving closer to each other  at least in terms of physical proximity.         
	Mamata Banerjees Trinamul has demanded a party office on the capitals Bishambhar Das Marg  a request that, if accepted, will make the party a neighbour of Sharad Pawars NCP.         
	The Telegraph has learnt that Trinamul has asked the urban development ministry to allot a bungalow for its party office on BD Marg, that also houses the NCP headquarters in Delhi.         
	At present, the urban development ministry has not officially allotted Trinamul an office there, but sources in both the party and the ministry said the allotment was expected soon.         
	Officially, no Trinamul or NCP leader would comment on any deeper implications of Mamatas demand.         
	But sources in both parties confirmed that Trinamuls demand for an abode near the NCP office in the capital came amid increasing unofficial talks between leaders of the two parties.         
	The official opponents of Trinamul  triumphant after its Lok Sabha success  and the NCP  relatively downcast after its diminished Lok Sabha tally  may be the Left and the right, respectively.         
	But the independent survival of both requires them to constantly look over their shoulder for their real challenge  the Congress they quit, but which could lure back its former leaders and workers.         
	Mamatas residence, C-4, MP apartments on Baba Kharak Singh Marg  less than a kilometre from BD Marg  currently hosts the Trinamuls office in Delhi.         
	The Trinamul chief was the sole MP the party had in the Lok Sabha between 2004 and 2009.         
	But the partys political fortunes have soared since, with Trinamul bagging 19 seats in the recent elections and emerging the single-largest ally of the Congress in the UPA.         
	But Trinamul and NCP leaders are also increasingly concluding that greater co-ordination  even unofficially  between them would help both to bargain politically with the Congress, the sources in both parties said.         
	Both Mamata and Pawar had demanded an official co- ordination mechanism between the UPA allies along the lines of a similar panel involving the Left in Manmohan Singhs first government. They had even suggested a common minimum programme reflecting assurances made to the people by all the UPA allies.         
	The mechanism and the common minimum programme would help create a common political roadmap of governance binding on the different allies, preventing internal crises in the alliance, Trinamul and the NCP argue officially.         
	Unofficially, leaders of the two parties concede that the mechanism and a common minimum programme would help ensure that the UPA government does not end up pushing the agenda of the Congress alone.         
	The Congress has so far stalled any plans to either set up an official co-ordination mechanism or draft a common minimum programme.

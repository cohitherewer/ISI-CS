The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | White Tiger beats White House
                                                                                                               White Tiger beats White House
          AMIT ROY                              Adiga, Obama: Face-off				                                 
	London, April 4: Aravind Adiga was named author of the year last night at the British Galaxy Book Awards defeating a strong field, among them Barack Obama.        
	The US President was a favourite for the title for his book The Audacity of Hope, which outlines his own deep-felt political and personal values. Unexpectedly, the Indian author of The White Tiger triumphed over the latest occupant of the White House.        
	It was just as well the American President had been nominated in two categories  for Dreams From My Father, his memoir of his early life and African-American heritage, was named biography of the year.        
	Obama was not at the awards ceremony at Grosvenor House Hotel in Londons Park Lane because he and his wife, Michelle, had already left for the Nato gathering in Strasbourg earlier on Friday after starring at the G20 summit. But plenty of pretty girls, such as actress Emilia Fox, attended to give the occasion a touch of glamour.        
	The British Galaxy Book Awards, which reflect the views of Britains massive publishing industry, is sponsored by a leading confectionery company.        
	Literary experts said the shortlist for the Borders Author of the Year read like a roll call of literary champions.         
	Adiga had won the 2008 Man Booker Prize with his novel The White Tiger; Sebastian Barry walked away with the Costa Book of the Year Award for his lyrical novel about a centenarian Irishwoman, The Secret Scripture; and Diana Athill, author of the rather more uplifting account of her own old age, Somewhere Towards the End, carried off the Costa Biography prize. Joining them on the journey was Rose Tremain and her 2008 Orange Prize-winning The Road Home.        
	But fighting back with the help of her teenage vampire tale, Breaking Dawn, was Stephenie Meyer, whose four books have been phenomenal best-sellers in the UK and the US.        
	Obamas The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream, to give it its full title, topped both the New York Times and Amazon.com best-seller lists in the autumn of 2006.         
	Inspiring though Obamas philosophy was, the judges were seduced by the amoral principles of Balram Halwai, the nasty chauffeur who does some not very nice things to his not very bad employer. Adiga has got a bit of stick in India for projecting an unflattering portrait of the country, but foreigners as well as many Indians  as he has always pointed out  seem to like it.

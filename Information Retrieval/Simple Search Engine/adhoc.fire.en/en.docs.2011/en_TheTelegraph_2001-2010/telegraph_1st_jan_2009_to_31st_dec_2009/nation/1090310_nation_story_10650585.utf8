          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, March 9: BJD corporator Tapas Ranjan Samantaray of ward number 50, accused of producing false Backward Class certificate to contest Cuttack Municipal Corporation election last month, is in trouble after the court of the district judge registered a complaint against him.         
	The court, in response to a complaint by Biswanath Sahu, a Congress candidate who had lost the ward poll, had issued summons to Samantaray to appear either in person or through a lawyer on March 20, the date fixed for hearing.        
	While issuing notices to candidates who had contested the election from the ward, the Election Commission, Cuttack collector and district election officer, the court called for all nomination records on the basis of which Samantaray was allowed to contest.         
	The complaint petition has claimed that the accused had managed to contest and get elected from ward number 50 reserved for backward class candidates, even as he belonged to general category. While seeking invalidation of Samantarays election as corporator of ward No. 50, the petition has claimed that the land patta (record of rights) indicated that he was Karan by caste, which is included in the general category.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bangalore, June 11: A scientific officer at the Kaiga atomic power station is untraced three days after going missing from a residential township near the high-security plant in the Western Ghats along the Karnataka coast.        
	L. Mahalingam, 47, had stepped out for a morning walk around 6am on Monday but did not return, says wife Vinayaka Sundaris complaint with Mallapur police in Karwar district.        
	Mahalingam, who is from Chennai, works in the plants simulator training section, police said. He is not a classified scientist and did not have access to critical information, a police source said.        
	The police are not ruling out the possibility of Mahalingam having met with a tragedy in the woods near Mallapur town.        
	Mahalingam was not a regular morning walker but went on and off, said Karwar police chief Raman Gupta, which makes it unlikely that he was waylaid and kidnapped. There was nothing suspicious about his behaviour in the past, said IG (western range) Gopal Hosur.        
	The Kaiga station, which houses three operational pressurised heavy water reactors and a fourth under construction, is set in a forest about 60km from the coastal town of Karwar. Mahalingam lived with his wife and daughter, a Class XI student, in a residential township for employees 20km from Mallapur. The township has a private security arrangement.        
	The scientist was no stranger to the surroundings, having worked there for over 10 years. We have already searched the 100-acre (township) compound and some surrounding areas, Gupta said.

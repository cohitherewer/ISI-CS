The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Protest train derails Mumbai lifeline
                                                                                                               Protest train derails Mumbai lifeline
  - Cancellation sparks commuter fury        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Mumbai, Feb. 4: Rumblings of discontent over the citys urban transportation system today burst into the open with commuters dependent on the railway lifeline blocking services to protest against daily inconveniences.         
	Thousands of passengers demanding an increase in the number of trains squatted on the tracks at Borivali, an important suburban junction, forcing a halt in Western Railway services for over four hours from 9.10am.         
	They dispersed only after a lathi-charge by police and an assurance by railway officials that their demands would be looked into.        
	BEST, the corporation that runs public road transport in Mumbai, pressed into service additional buses to help the passengers stranded in the distant suburbs of Borivali, Malad and Kandivali reach their workplaces in south and central Mumbai.         
	The citys local trains carry over 6.3 million passengers every day.        
	The stand-off, triggered by the cancellation of a 9.10am Borivali local, has again brought to the fore the governments lackadaisical approach to urban transport in the megapolis bursting at its seams.         
	Proposals for improving and widening the network have been gathering dust for years, said sources.         
	BJP leader Ram Naik, a former minister of state for railways and a resident of Borivali, said: The Mumbai Rail Vikas Corporation was set up specifically to look into the commuting problems of Mumbai citizens, but has been working very slowly. It has been tardy in implementing all 21 projects under its purview.         
	The railway ministry has been changing the divisional general managers every six to eight months. As a result, they do not fully understand the problems of commuters or cant do much about them.        
	Railway authorities were quick to fish out statistics to argue that there were enough trains.         
	Sixty-three new services have been added. But we will look into the grievances raised by the commuters. We will try to improve the entry and exit points and look into complaints by commuters at big terminals like Borivali, said S. Gupta, chief public relations officer, Western Railway.        
	Actor and suburb hero Govinda, who had defeated Naik to win the Mumbai North West Lok Sabha seat in 2004 but is now reviled as an invisible MP, shrugged off the protests.         
	In the last five years, the number of trains has been increased considerably, he said, alleging that the protests were motivated.

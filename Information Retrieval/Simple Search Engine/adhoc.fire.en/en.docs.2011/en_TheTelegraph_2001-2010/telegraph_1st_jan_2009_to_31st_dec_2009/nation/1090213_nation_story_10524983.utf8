          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           Moral police on watch. Picture by U.K. Pal                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 12: Tie a knot or tie a rakhi  that would be the action that Bajrang Dal activists would insist on this Valentines Day.        
	Out to spoil the celebration of love once again, Bajrang Dal activists have decided to marry off couples found displaying affection in public on Saturday.         
	We will be carrying garlands and vermilion while raiding parks, restaurants and hotels. If the couple refuse to marry, we will leave them only after they tie rakhis on each other, said Raju Singh, Rourkela unit secretary of Bajrang Dal.         
	The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), RSS and the Aditya Vahini have joined the protest, warning hotels and restaurants to refrain from entertaining lovebirds.         
	At Rourkela, more than five shops selling cards were closed down today with a section of activists resorting to burning of greeting cards.         
	Threatening to disrupt the celebrations, ABVP state secretary Sanjay Das said: We will be keeping a close watch on parks and hotels and foil any attempts by youngsters to get cosy. Exchanging gifts, dining in hotels, sitting at lonely places, holding hands or any public display of affection will be strictly dealt with. We have also requested the government to take steps to ban the celebrations, Das added.         
	We are not against love but against the idea of celebrating it on this particular day decided by the West. We are against youngsters getting blindly carried away by the western culture, said he.         
	The saffron outfit has suggested changing the celebration of love to some other day instead of February 14 .Why cant our Indian couples celebrate it on days like Vasant Utsav? asked Subash Chauhan, the national convener of Bajrang Dal.         
	There is no shortage of love stories in our culture. There is the Radha-Krishna and Kedar-Gauri love stories. What is the need for our youngsters to facilitate cultural invasion and follow the west by celebrating this day?         
	The groups are also planning to stage a protest rally and a mock funeral of St Valentine.         
	Its neither a nuisance nor a vulgar practice. Its a way of taking out some time for your loved ones in our hectic everyday life. There are a hundred more important issues lying unnoticed. Why dont the moral police divert their attention towards those? asked Preeti Jain, an MBA student.        
	Meanwhile, shop owners said that the response from the youths has been similar to previous years with many thronging gift shops to pick up something special.         
	However, many expressed reluctance to keep their shops open on Saturday to avoid any kind of untoward incidents.         
	Youngsters, however, expressed a different opinion.

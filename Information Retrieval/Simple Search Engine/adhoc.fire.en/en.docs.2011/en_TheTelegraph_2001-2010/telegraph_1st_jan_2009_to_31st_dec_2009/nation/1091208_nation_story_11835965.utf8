The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Copenhagen - Day 1
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Copenhagen - Day 1

	Stout defence        
	Rajendra Pachauri, head of the UNs Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, defends the scientific consensus on global warming in the face of Climategate  about 1,000 hacked emails purportedly showing climate scientists conspiring to hide evidence that dont fit their theories.        
	The recent incident... shows that some would go to the extent of carrying out illegal acts perhaps in an attempt to discredit the IPCC, he said.        
	But the panel has a record of transparent and objective assessment stretching over 21 years performed by tens of thousands of dedicated scientists from all corners of the globe. The internal consistency from multiple lines of evidence strongly supports the work of the scientific community, including those individuals singled out in these email exchanges, many of whom have dedicated their time and effort to develop these findings.        
	That Pachauri mentioned the emails at all betrayed policymakers deep fears that the row over the emails, sent by and to the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia, UK, was taking the momentum away from them at the worst possible time        
	Cold logic        
	Mohamad Shinaz, climate        
	activist from the Maldives, plunges feet-first into a tank with nearly 750 litres of frigid water to illustrate what rising sea levels were doing to his island nation. I want people to know that this is happening, Shinaz said, the water reaching up to his chest. We have to stop global warming        
	Hope amp; history        
	Conference opens with video clips of children from around the globe urging delegates to help them grow up in a world without catastrophic warming. At the summit opening, Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen says: Ladies and        
	gentlemen, the world is depositing hope with you for a short while in the history of mankind        
	Media blitz        
	Some 56 newspapers from 45 countries publish joint editorial urging world leaders to take decisive action. Its published in 20 languages, including Chinese, Arabic and Russian, in newspapers including The Guardian in London, Le Monde in France, The Toronto Star, Gulf Times, Botswana Guardian and The Miami Herald        
	Too many cooks...        
	The G-77 group of developing nations is worried that too many parallel drafts of a potential agreement  some 15, including the BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India, China) draft  are floating around the summit. It feels so many texts are not manageable              
	Not enough        
	Study released by UN Environment Programme indicates that pledges by industrial countries and major emerging nations fall just short of the reductions of greenhouse gas emissions that scientists have said are needed to keep average temperatures from rising more than 2C              
	SA offer              
	South Africa offers to slow the growth of its greenhouse gas emissions by 34 per cent by 2020 and 42 per cent by 2025, conditional on a broader international agreement and provision of finance, technology and support              
	And in India...              
	Concern over climate change has risen by one per cent over the past two years, a survey by Nielsen and Oxford University says. Indians are very concerned about air pollution (62 per cent), water pollution and shortage (61 per cent), and global warming (54 per cent). Globally, however, concern over climate change has fallen (37 per cent) with recession worries at the top of peoples minds

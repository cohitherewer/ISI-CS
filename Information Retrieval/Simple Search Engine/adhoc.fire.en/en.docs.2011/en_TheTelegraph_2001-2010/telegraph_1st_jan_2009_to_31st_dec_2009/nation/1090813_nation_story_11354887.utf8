          ANANYA SENGUPTA                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 12: Prank or paranoia?        
	This is what Delhi police officials are asking themselves after picking up at least three persons for questioning in connection with a bomb threat on an IndiGo Airlines flight to Calcutta this afternoon.        
	The call turned out to be a hoax and Flight 6E 203 finally left around 8 this evening, three-and-a-half hours behind schedule, but not before the 120-odd passengers were told to get off and the plane searched.        
	The police said among the three men brought in for questioning was a passenger on the flight who claimed that he overheard some fellow passengers speaking about a bomb in the plane.        
	A chain of calls apparently followed  between the passenger and people outside  leading to the call to an IndiGo call centre, which warned the airport control room.        
	The call came around 3.40, 50 minutes before the planes rescheduled departure. The flight had already been delayed by an hour because of the security drill ahead of Independence Day.        
	The fellows told us they had overheard some passengers speaking about a bomb in the plane and wanted to warn the authorities. We are investigating if it was a misunderstanding, genuine concern or a prank. It seems there was a chain of people involved in the call, with one informing the other about a bomb threat. The last call was made to the (IndiGo) call centre, said joint commissioner of police (operations) Satyendra Garg.        
	Police sources said the call had been traced to someone whose last name is Khandelwal, but refused to confirm if it was the surname of the passenger brought in for questioning.        
	The call came less than three weeks after a mentally unstable passenger on a Delhi-Mumbai flight of the same airline claimed there was a bomb on board and that the aircraft should be diverted to Pakistan.        
	The passenger, Sanjay Malik, 28, was handed over to the Central Industrial Security Force after the plane landed in Mumbai.        
	At Delhi airport today, security personnel went into a tizzy after the 3.40pm call. The passengers were told to get off and the plane was taken to a remote bay where a bomb disposal squad searched it. CISF personnel encircled the plane while a threat assessment committee of airport security officials and the police held a meeting.

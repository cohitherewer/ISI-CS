The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | From London to torture chamber
                                                                                                               From London to torture chamber
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                          Shabina, whose husband Usmangani Ansari was allegedly illegally detained and tortured by Gujarat police, with her twin sons in Delhi. (Rajesh Kumar)                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 29: Families of five Muslim men picked up for an alleged plot to bomb Vadodara have accused Gujarat police of illegal detention and torture.        
	One of them, a tailor who returned from London a month ago, was given electric shocks all over his body and couldnt walk when relatives met him at a police station, his family claimed.        
	The allegations come close on the heels of a magistrates report that said state police killed a 19-year-old college girl in a staged encounter five years ago, though Gujarat High Court later stayed the report.        
	The five men  all from Fatehpura Hathikhana, a lower-middle-class, Muslim-dominated area in Vadodara city  were picked up days before Ganesh Visarjan on September 3 and the Gujarat bypolls a week later, and booked under the arms act and the explosives act.        
	Their families have moved the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and the National Commission for Minorities (NCM), alleging that all five had been kept in illegal custody for several days and tortured before being produced in court. None of them had a police record.        
	The minority panel has sent a team of officials to Vadodara to probe the allegations.        
	Tailor Iqbal Hussain, 40, was whisked away by four men, allegedly cops. Zahir Abbas, 22, was picked up the same day and detained for four days.         
	He had just come back from offering namaz on September 2 when a man came and said he was wanted downstairs. He went outside and as soon as he crossed the road, he was manhandled by at least 20-25 men who pushed him into a waiting car. For four days we didnt know anything about his whereabouts, said Zahirs mother Rehmat Abbas.        
	It was on September 6 that we finally met him. He couldnt speak. He just told me, Amma, mere liye duwa karo (Mother, pray for me). His lips had swollen and he had to be carried by two policemen.        
	Mustaq Ismail Shaeikh, 34, was picked up on September 1, Amin Razak Shah, 39, on September 2, and Usmangani Ansari, 35, on September 3.        
	All the arrests were shown to be on September 6, a day before Vadodara police commissioner Rakesh Asthana told a media conference that the five were part of a group that had planned to bomb areas in the city during Ganesh Visarjan.         
	The commissioner said the five were arrested with rocket launchers and sutli bombs, but none of these was on display.        
	Shabnam Hashmi, a social activist who met Iqbal and Zahir in jail, said the duo told her they were taken to a farmhouse outside the city and tortured. Iqbal said two men stood on his thighs, legs stretched wide, and beat him up brutally. He was given electric shocks from the waist down.        
	Zahir said he was stripped naked and given electric shocks all over his body. They were beaten up with lathis and forced to sign confessional statements.        
	The families of the five later travelled to Delhi to take their grievances to the NHRC and NMC.         
	We got threat calls asking us not to go to Delhi. We thought of not going but changed our mind, said Usmanganis brother Ghansar.

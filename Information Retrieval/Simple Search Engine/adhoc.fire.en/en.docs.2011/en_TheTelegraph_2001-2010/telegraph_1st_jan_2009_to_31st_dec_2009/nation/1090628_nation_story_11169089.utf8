                                                                                                               Students killed, stink of love rivalry
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, June 27: Two teenaged high school students were found with their heads smashed and bodies battered in a field on the citys southern fringes this morning in a suspected revenge crime that police said could have been over a girl.        
	S.K. Chowdhury, the additional police superintendent, South 24-Parganas, said they had arrested a 16-year-old, a student of the same Bishnupur school the victims studied, and a hunt was on for another accused, Tarun Mondal, 22.        
	Both the victims and the alleged killers are from the same locality in Bishnupur, about 25km from Calcutta.        
	The bodies of Sudipta Manna, 15, and Bappa Mondal, 14  students of Nandabhanga High School  were found when the arrested teen, Subhankar Adhikari, led relatives of the dead boys to the field after being cornered and thrashed this morning.        
	We have arrested Subhankar on the basis of complaints by parents of the dead boys. But Mondal fled last night, Chowdhury said.        
	An officer probing the case said the murders were pre-planned and revenge may have played a role. The brutal nature of the murders suggests that revenge was a motive. We are looking into a possible love angle, the officer added.        
	Residents said Subhankar had an affair with a teenaged girl of the same locality for whom Sudipta and Bappa, the murdered boys, had also developed a soft corner.        
	We know Subhankar was not on good terms with Sudipta and Bappa over the affair. He must have plotted the murders with Tarun, said Shankar Mondal, 35, a cousin of Bappa.        
	Police sources said the families of the victims suspected something was wrong when Sudipta and Bappa did not return home even after 10 last night. When Tarun returned home a little past midnight, they asked him.        
	When he said he didnt know where the missing boys could be, the relatives went to Subhankars house but didnt find him at home.        
	The relatives then lodged a missing diary at Bishnupur police station late last night.        
	After a sleepless night, the parents of the murdered boys again knocked on Taruns door. But by then, he had fled.        
	The parents then rushed to Subhankars house and started grilling him. When he fumbled, they thrashed him and also beat up his mother, Purnima, 42, after tying her up.        
	Some residents then rushed to Taruns house. Not finding him anywhere, they dragged out his mother, Shyamali, 45, shaved her head and beat her up.        
	With mob fury mounting, Subhankar broke down, and led the relatives to the field where Bappa and Sudipta had been murdered.        
	Asansol murder        
	A motorcycle-borne assailant, face covered with a cloth, pumped five bullets into a Left union leader in Asansol as he accompanied his wife and son to a railway station this morning, reports our correspondent.        
	Subhash Majhi, 54, the general secretary of CPI labour arm Aituc at public sector company Hindustan Cables, was attacked around 5.45 in Rupnarayanpur in Asansols Salanpur area, 250km from Calcutta.        
	Police rushed Majhi to Asansol Sub-divisional Hospital where doctors pronounced him dead.        
	The CPI has called a 12-hour bandh in Rupnarayanpur tomorrow.

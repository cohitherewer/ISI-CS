          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Nov. 27: Rapped for lying, Pakistani gunman Ajmal Kasabs lawyer today apologised to judge M.L. Tahaliyani who allowed him to continue as defence counsel, defusing a crisis that could have delayed the 26/11 trial by a few months.         
	This is a historic trial and I have done my best to defend the accused. What happened yesterday (was) in the heat of the moment, and I tender an unconditional apology, Abbas Kazmi told the court.        
	Judge Tahaliyani said he didnt want to aggravate the issue. I am not against you, he said, and added that the observations against Kazmi stood withdrawn.        
	The standoff was over 340 affidavits sworn by witnesses whose evidence was of a formal nature and had no direct link with the three accused on trial.        
	The prosecution wanted to admit the affidavits yesterday but Kazmi had objected. He said the prosecution made no formal application before the court but had handed over 232 affidavits to him without giving any indication when they would be taken up.        
	Kazmi had then accused the prosecution of trying to hurry up the process in an attempt to wrap up examination of evidence by yesterday.        
	An annoyed Tahaliyani said Kazmi was lying because special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam Nikam had several times indicated his plans about adducing the affidavits. He adjourned the hearing and indicated that if Kazmi were removed, his associate K.P. Pawar could represent Kasab.         
	Kazmi expressed hurt at being described as a liar. He asked for 24 hours to reply to the courts observations.

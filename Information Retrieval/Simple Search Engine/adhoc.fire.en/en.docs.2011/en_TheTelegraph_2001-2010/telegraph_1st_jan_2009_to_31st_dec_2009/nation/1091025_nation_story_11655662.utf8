          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Srinagar, Oct. 24: Pakistani troops today opened fire on Indian positions along the Line of Control in Poonch, four days ahead of the Prime Ministers visit to Kashmir.        
	The army said the incident took place at 9.30am at the Krishanghati sector when Indian troops were heading towards a post.        
	There was heavy firing from the other side which left Naik Om Bahadur Gurum of the 2/8 Gorkha Riffles injured, an official said. The firing continued for more than half an hour. Our troops exercised restraint and did not retaliate to the Pakistani firing.        
	Defence spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Biplab Nath said the Pakistani troops used small arms. This was unprovoked firing. We are lodging a strong protest with the Pakistani authorities on this issue. The firing from across has often been done to provide cover to infiltrating militants but this time, the army said, it was not the case.        
	A six-year-old ceasefire is officially in place between the two countries but there have been violations since last year.        
	Manmohan Singh will be accompanied by railway minister Mamata Banerjee, who will inaugurate the 18km stretch of railway line in Kashmir.

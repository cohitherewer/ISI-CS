          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Lucknow, April 7: Amar Singh today dropped hints of resigning from the Samjwadi Party over an attack launched on him by his senior colleague Azam Khan, only to assert at night that everything is normal and he would not leave the party.        
	I can leave the world but I cant leave the party, Amar told a hurriedly convened media conference.        
	Khan has been campaigning against Jayapradas candidature in Rampur, his hometown from where she had won in 2004. Khan has also been criticising Amar for inviting former BJP chief minister Kalyan Singh to campaign.         
	I know where I stand. The day I feel I had enough, then I will say goodbye to Mulayamji and leave the party, Amar had said earlier in the day.        
	But hours later, Amar described the comment as an off-the-cuff-remark. There is nothing wrong. Everything is normal.

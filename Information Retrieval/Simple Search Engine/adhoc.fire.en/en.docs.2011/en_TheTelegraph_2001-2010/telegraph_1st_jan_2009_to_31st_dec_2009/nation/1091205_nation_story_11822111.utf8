	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 4: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor D. Subbarao today suggested that the Orissa government includes financial literacy in school and college curricula to enable the next generation tide over economic crisis.        
	The suggestion was made by Subbarao during his meeting with chief minister Naveen Patnaik here this afternoon. Naveen agreed to consider its inclusion curriculum, said the RBI chief.        
	During the discussions, stress was laid on the increase in credit-deposit ratio. Naveen urged Subbarao to ensure disbursal of more soft and easy loans by commercial banks to state farmers. The request assumes significance against the backdrop of a string of farmer suicides reported across the state allegedly because of lack of bank credit forcing them to avail loan from private money-lenders at high interest rate.        
	Naveen also stressed on more credit flow to the small industries sector, expansion of bank network in rural areas and extension of bank service to poor. People will be benefited by the expansion of bank network in rural areas. The initiative of the government to pay wages to the beneficiaries of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme can be successful by the spread of reach of banks in rural areas, he said.        
	Price rise of consumer goods also figured during the discussion, sources said.        
	Earlier, addressing a bankers meet on financial inclusion and promotion of financial literacy, Subbarao said commercial banks would come out with a plan for financial inclusion by the end of the current fiscal.        
	Villages with a population of over 2,000 would have access to financial services by the end of this fiscal, he said. RBI would review its economic growth projections next month, said Subbarao while interacting with bankers during an outreach programme at Jalanga village in Bhadrak district yesterday.        
	The RBI chief also asked the bankers to stress on agriculture financing to accelerate economic growth in rural areas. The focus in rural areas should be on providing loans to the agricultural sector, he said.                           
	Subbarao had visited Jalanga village, adopted by Uco Bank under its financial inclusion initiative. Besides interacting with the bankers, he also inaugurated a farmers club there.

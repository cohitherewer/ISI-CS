The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | LSE lecture invitation for Nitish
                                                                                                               LSE lecture invitation for Nitish
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Aug. 21: After his arch-rival and former railway minister Lalu Prasad, it is the turn of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar to take the centre stage abroad to address university students and academia.        
	London School of Economics has invited Nitish to attend the international growth centres Growth Week 2009 programme at its campus during September 22-25.         
	Lalu Prasad visited Harvard and Wharton in the US, besides Malaysia and Singapore, to deliver lectures to management students on the Indian Railways.        
	But unlike Lalu Prasad, who earned the sobriquet of management guru and was fond of delivering lecture on the turnaround of the railways abroad, Nitish does not appear too enthusiastic to go abroad.         
	The state is battling with the drought situation. My governments priority is to address the plight of the drought-affected farmers. I will take a decision on the invitation later, Nitish said.                    
	The international growth centre executive director, Gobind Nalkani, and co-directors Paul Collier and Rohan Burgess have requested Nitish to join panellists and academia for research and policy sessions from September 22 to September 25.        
	Though his political and official advisers have been trying to convince Nitish of the importance of delivering a lecture on the prestigious platform abroad, the chief minister must be remembering how the Opposition had attacked him on his Mauritius trip in 2007 when north Bihar districts were battling flood.

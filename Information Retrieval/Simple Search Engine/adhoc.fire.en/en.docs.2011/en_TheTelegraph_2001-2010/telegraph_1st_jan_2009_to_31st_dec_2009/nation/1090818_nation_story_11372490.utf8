The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Early apex court hearing in gay case
                                                                                                               Early apex court hearing in gay case
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 17: The Supreme Court today said it would hear as soon as possible pleas to stay the Delhi High Court verdict legalising adult consensual gay sex because of the sensitivities involved but refused to set aside the order immediately.        
	In view of the sensitivities involved in the case, we will hear it on a priority basis, a bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan said.        
	The bench sought a response from the Centre as it clubbed two petitions  one filed by the secretary to yoga guru Ramdev and another by a Christian association  with a bunch of similar pleas. The petitions are likely to come up for hearing on September 14.        
	The court had earlier too issued notices to the Centre on another petition filed by an astrologer who said the July 2 high court judgment would open the floodgates of male prostitution. Notices were also issued to the Naz Foundation, an NGO that had filed the high court case in favour of gay rights, and other respondents.        
	Arguing for Ramdevs secretary today, his lawyer claimed that if allowed to sustain, the judgment legalising homosexuality, earlier a criminal offence, would have a catastrophic effect on the moral fabric of society and jeopardise the institution of marriage. This offends the structure of the Indian value system, Indian culture and traditions, the petition added.        
	It would encourage male prostitution too, the lawyer for Ramdevs secretary said.        
	The petition on behalf of the Christian Apostolic Churches Alliance, an umbrella body of 22 churches in Delhi, contended that legal acknowledgement of homosexuality was a step away from recognising same-sex marriages and would bring about the ruin of the concept of family. Homosexuality will disrupt (the peace of) matrimonial homes, it said.        
	The chief justice, however, appeared to disagree. How does it affect marriages? he wondered.

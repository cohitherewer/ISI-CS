The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Muslims keep their faith in Mulayam   Thumbs down to Nafisa choice
                                                                                                               Muslims keep their faith in Mulayam 
  Thumbs down to Nafisa choice          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Nafisa Ali before filing her nomination in Lucknow on April 8. (AP)                                         
	Lucknow, April 11: First he cosied up to Kalyan Singh. Then Mulayam Singh Yadav went ahead with Maanyata Dutts choice and named Nafisa Ali his Lucknow candidate.        
	Many city Muslims believe that was a mistake. It is one seat down for the Samajwadi Party and one up for the BJP, said Yasoob Abbas, spokesperson for the Shia Personal Law Board.        
	Four days before the Samajwadis announced Nafisas candidature, she had come to my place and said that since she was contesting as a Congress nominee, could the citys Shias please support her? Abbas said.        
	Unlike other Uttar Pradesh cities, Shias are numerically large in Lucknow: the state capital has three lakh Shias and five lakh Sunnis in a population of nearly 35 lakh.        
	I said, Okay. So imagine my shock when I saw her with Amar Singh and Sanjay Dutt, Abbas said. Tomorrow, she may cross over to the BSP  or, who knows, to the BJP. One thing is certain: Nafisa wont be a favourite with the Muslims.        
	Yet Mulayam might be, all things considered  despite the rumour mills claiming a Samajwadi-BJP pact to confuse Muslim voters by fielding Nafisa and thus stymie the BSPs Akhilesh Das.        
	And despite the pact between Mulayam and Kalyan  the man who as BJP chief minister presided over the 1992 Babri demolition  having become a talking point. It could dent the Samajwadis minority following, but only by so much, because Muslims are still distrustful of Mayavati and see the Congress as a non-starter.        
	Lawyer Zafaryab Jilani, an All India Muslim Personal Law Board member, put the matter in perspective.        
	We were upset with Mulayams brother, Shivpal Singh Yadav, for saying the backward caste votes were enough (Kalyan is an OBC Lodh-Rajput). Some Samajwadi Muslims were upset and left in protest, Jilani said.        
	We also have to consider that while Mayavatis Dalits vote lock, stock and barrel for any Muslim candidate of hers, the same is not true of Mulayams Yadavs. They dont necessarily vote for his Muslim nominees. Strangely, they get communal.        
	But he quickly added: This does not mean that Kalyan has caused us to give Mulayam a burial. We may be angry with Mulayam but we have to see who has the best chance of defeating the BJP.        
	Akhtar Hussain Rizvi, a local non-aligned activist, said: We are politically the most mature community. It would not be an exaggeration to say our stakes in the political system are the highest because we depend on it for the one thing all humans want: security of life and limb.        
	He added: We dont expect anything great from the system like the other communities. Mulayam saved the Babri mosque (when he was chief minister during the 1990 rath yatra and kar seva) and it will take a long, long while for our faith in him to be shaken.        
	To Maulana Khalid Rasheed, the Naib Imam of Lucknows Idgah mosque, development is as important as security. On that score, he believes, Mayavati has acquitted herself almost as well as Mulayam.        
	If Mulayam appointed Urdu teachers and breathed life into a dying language, Mayavati gave Uttar Pradesh its first Arabic-Persian university, set up a Unani medicine directorate and replaced the police stations in Muslim-majority areas with schools and colleges.        
	Still, the community trusts Mulayam more than Mayavati. Most Muslims swear that come what may, he would not do business with the BJP even it offered him heaven on earth.        
	I wish I could say the same for Mayavati but I cant. She thrice took the BJPs help to form a government, and worse, campaigned for Narendra Modi immediately after the Gujarat riots, said Masood Jilani, editor of Hindi daily Swach Sandesh.        
	And the rumours over Nafisa? In Lucknow, a city where the Awadhi knack for court intrigues and conspiracy theories still thrives, it took minutes for the gossip outlets to turn out stories of a Samajwadi-BJP saanth-gaanth (understanding) over the Lucknow seat.        
	Mulayam and BJP candidate Lalji Tandon are buddies, dont you know, the wagging tongues went. Remember how Mulayam supported Tandon when there was a stampede as he gave away saris at a rally before the 2004 elections?        
	Yet few Muslims are buying this. Given the options before them in a bleak political landscape, they still see the Samajwadis as the lesser evil.

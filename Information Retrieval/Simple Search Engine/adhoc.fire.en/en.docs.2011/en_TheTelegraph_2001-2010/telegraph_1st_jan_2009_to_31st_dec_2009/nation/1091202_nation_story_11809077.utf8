The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sunrise with liquor sale
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sunrise with liquor sale
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, Dec. 1: Suraj ast Nepal mast (The sun sets, and Nepal goes gaga)  Bihar residents would invariably repeat this adage in the context of the Himalayan republic; its streets dotted with ubiquitous liquor shops and tipplers crowding them particularly after sunset.        
	Now it is Suraj ast Bihar mast with the consumption of liquor going up by a whopping 300 per cent and liquor shops more than doubling in the states hinterlands, thanks to the Nitish Kumar governments largess to tipplers and liquor-sellers.        
	With the manifold rise, the Bihar government has earned a whopping Rs 749.15 crore during 2008-09 from excise duty. The state in 2004-05  the last year of the Lalu-Rabri regime  had earned a paltry Rs 272.53 crore from excise duty.        
	Unlike in Nepal and neighbouring Jharkhand where drinking hadia has been a part of tribal culture, drinking liquor was virtually a taboo in Bihar villages. The states hinterlands have numerous tales of drunkard youths not being approached for marriage.        
	But the scenario has changed now. The states rural areas only had 2,797 liquor shops in 2006-07, the first and second years of Nitish in the saddle. Today there are least 6,184 liquor outlets, including country liquor and beer shops. And the number of liquor shops in the countryside is set to rise phenomenally with the excise and prohibition department deciding to sanction one liquor shop each in three village panchayats.        
	Sources in the excise department said there were seven country liquor shops and six foreign liquor shops for every lakh people in the country. Bihar still has far fewer liquor shops in the context of national average, said an excise department official.        
	He added: We are trying to open four foreign liquor shops and six country liquor shops for every lakh of people in the state.        
	Bihar was a backward state in terms of liquor consumption, too. But with the government liberalising the excise policy, the liquor shops are coming up by leaps and bounds. According to the new excise policy, the liquor merchants are being allowed to lift the bottles and liquor pouches without paying the initial 15 per cent excise duty.        
	Liquor traders and experts believe that the purchasing power of the rural populace has risen considerably of late with the development schemes reaching out to the grassroots level and people earning cash by working for the NREGA, road and other projects.        
	The money, probably, has added to the enjoyment of the poor people.                    
	Ironically, Nitish, a teetotaller, has been earning more for the state by way of excise duty in comparison to his flamboyant rival Lalu Prasad who loved his food and drinks and still earned less.

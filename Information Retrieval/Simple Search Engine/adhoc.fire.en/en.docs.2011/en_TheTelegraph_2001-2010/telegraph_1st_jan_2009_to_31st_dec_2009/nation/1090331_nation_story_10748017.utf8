          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          BJP general secretary Arun Jaitley releases the party manifesto for Orissa at a news conference in Bhubaneswar on Monday. Picture by Sanjib Mukherjee                                  
	Bhubaneswar, March 30: Chief minister and BJD boss Naveen Patnaik was a political leader with non-ideological flexibility, BJP leader Arun Jaitley said here today, adding that his party should have pulled out from the coalition long ago.         
	We were perhaps over-committed to the coalition dharma, said Jaitley, after releasing the Orissa version of the party manifesto here.         
	We were abiding by the coalition dharma and a coalition partner (BJD) was committing political adultery, he said, adding that the statements of Left parties proved that conspiracies to break the alliance were going on for a year.         
	In hindsight, perhaps we should have pulled out after the death of Swami Laxmananda Saraswati last year, he said.         
	On whether the communal carnage in Kandhamal was a reaction to Swamijis murder, Jaitley said the atmosphere in the region had remained disturbed for a long time over religious conversion. The party manifesto promised to enact a stringent law against religious conversion and cow slaughter if it came to power in Orissa again, he said.        
	Promising to set up a taskforce to counter Maoists, the party promised to allow the division of the state (perhaps making an oblique reference to JMMs demand for inclusion of three Orissa districts in Greater Jharkhand).         
	The major challenge for BJP was to completely occupy the non-Congress space in Orissa.         
	We will try to form the government on our own strength in Orissa, he said, adding that the party would provide rice at Re 1 and dal at Rs 5 per kg and free salt to all BPL families if voted to power in Orissa.

	Mumbai, June 28: A Calcutta record will fall on Tuesday when Mumbai inaugurates Indias first open-sea bridge.        
	The 6km-long Bandra-Worli Sea Link, likely to become one of the citys sights like the Gateway of India, has a main span (the distance between the suspension towers) of 500 metres, beating Vidyasagar Setus current Indian record of 457.2 metres.        
	Pride and pomp apart, the bridge will save motorists time and money as they travel from residential suburbs to south Mumbais office district during peak hours.        
	The cable-stayed bridge runs over an arm of the sea to link Bandra in the western suburbs to Worli in central Mumbai. It has two carriageways with four lanes each, but only one carriageway with four lanes is complete. The other carriageway is expected to be finished by December.        
	Motorists have to pass through 23 traffic signals to travel the 7.7km distance between Mahim Causeway and Worli, and the drive takes about 40 minutes during peak hours. In comparison, the bridge takes one across in five to seven minutes even if there is a 50km speed limit, said Sagar Tawade, an official of the Hindustan Construction Company, which built the bridge commissioned by the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC).        
	Sumantra Chowdhury, additional chief secretary (transport department) in Bengal, didnt seem to mind Calcutta losing the record.        
	Chowdhury, who has additional charge of Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners, the custodian of Vidyasagar Setu, said he was aware that a bridge with a longer span was coming up in Mumbai.        
	No achievement remains unbeaten in this growing world. Records are made to be broken, he said.        
	The Sutong Bridge over the river Yangtze in China, opened in June last year, has the largest span of any cable-stayed bridge at 1,088 metres.        
	The Bandra-Worli sea link has been attracting hundreds of curious citizens and Mumbais rich and powerful, keen for a view. Its phosphorescent lines of cable gleam in the shape of the letter A, lighting up the evening skyline over Mahim harbour.        
	It has two towers at the Bandra and Worli ends, using 264 and 160 stay cables respectively to support the bridge.        
	Pedestrians, two-wheelers, and three-wheelers will not be allowed on the bridge, but BEST buses can ply. When all the lanes are ready, the government plans to reserve two exclusively for BEST buses.        
	The bridge is expected to take 125,000 cars a day in each direction, with the traffic growing at 250 cars a day, Tawade said.        
	The toll can be paid in cash, or with a pre-paid smart card, or by using a fully automated system.        
	Motorists can buy an on-board unit with one-time investment, and the toll would be automatically deducted electronically through a toll-tag (fitted to the cars windscreen) and transponder. They do not have to stop at the toll plaza and can save precious time, Tawade said.        
	Although bus commuters will have to pay more because of the Rs 100 toll, an MSRDC official said it would come to a nominal increase of Rs 1.50 over the normal fare.        
	Originally conceived to cost Rs 666 crore in 1999, the delays inflated the bridges cost to Rs 1,634 crore.        
	Work orders had been issued in the year 2000 but the project ran into rough weather in 2001 with environmental groups moving court. They claimed the project would increase monsoon flooding, threaten the livelihood of coastal fisherfolk, and increase traffic congestion by bringing more vehicles into central and south Mumbai.         
	However, Bombay High Court and the Supreme Court rejected the petitions and subsequent appeals, and construction resumed in 2005.        
	While the Bandra end of the bridge connects directly with the wide Western Express Highway leading to Mumbai airport, the Worli end of the bridge meets the Worli Sea Face at a T-shaped traffic junction.        
	Transport experts have warned that unless efficiently managed, heavy vehicular flow could lead to jams and the precious time saved by the motorists on the bridge could be lost at this junction.

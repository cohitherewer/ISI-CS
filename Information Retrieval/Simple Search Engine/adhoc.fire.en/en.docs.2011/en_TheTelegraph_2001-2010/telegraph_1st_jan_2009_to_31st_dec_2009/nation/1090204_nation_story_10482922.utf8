The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Court refuses to stop TN Lanka strike
                                                                                                               Court refuses to stop TN Lanka strike
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 3: The Supreme Court today refused to stop political parties in Tamil Nadu from going ahead with a proposed state-wide general strike tomorrow to press for a ceasefire in Sri Lanka.         
	What can this court do? Everybody has a right to express their feelings, a bench headed by the chief justice said, dismissing a plea by a 37-year-old Chennai resident.        
	The petitioner, Jayaneethi Saravna Satish Kumar, argued that the parties were going to hold a bandh under a different name. Such emotional appeals have resulted in self-immolation and attempts at self-immolation, Kumar said, adding that he feared widespread violence and destruction of public property if the strike was allowed.         
	Bandhs, which bring life to a grinding halt, are banned by the Supreme Court as illegal and unconstitutional. In the past, the court has generally intervened to stop bandhs.        
	The petitioner today sought an urgent directive declaring the proposed strike illegal in public interest. But the court said it would hear the case in due course on February 16.        
	Kumars lawyer Ajit Pudussery said he would later file an amended petition for disqualification of the parties that have called the strike, for violating the earlier court order on bandhs.         
	The Sri Lankan Tamils Protection Movement, an umbrella organisation consisting of parties such as the PMK, CPI, MDMK and the VCK, has called the strike.         
	Analysts said todays order showed the apex courts reluctance to intervene in what is seen as part of the executives domain. The court is fighting shy of dealing with such orders because of widespread criticism of what is seen as judicial activism, a senior counsel said.         
	Kumar had sought enforcement of his fundamental rights  under Articles 19 and 21 (right to life and liberty)  as well as those of other residents of Tamil Nadu. The citizens right to move freely and practise their trade, occupation and business would be affected, he said.         
	The parties have by clever manipulation tried to avoid the law laid down by the Supreme Court banning bandhs, he added.         
	Their real intention is evident from their subsequent utterances widely reported in papers that the so-called general strike would amount to total closure of all activities in Tamil Nadu, Kumar said.

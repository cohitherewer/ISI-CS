	 Dubai, Dec. 27 (PTI): Expatriates in Saudi Arabia, including a large number of Indian workers, will be issued permanent resident visas based only on their financial status, not their profession.          
	 Such visas were earlier issued only to white-collar professionals like engineers, doctors and executives. The move, reported by Arabic daily Al-Yaum, comes as a big relief for many of the seven million expatriates unable to bring their families because of legal restrictions. After the announcement, many Indian workers have approached the Indian embassy to include their spouses names in their passports.                   
	 New Delhi (PTI): The Federal Bureau of Investigation has turned down Indias request for the extradition of terror suspect David Headley. Officials said that he would first have to undergo his sentence in the US if convicted. There appears no possibility of the Pakistani American being handed over since he could be sentenced to death or to 200 or 300 years in jail, sources said.                   
	 New Delhi (PTI): A fresh extension of three months has been given to the director of NCERT after it could not complete the appointment process for the top post within the scheduled time. Around 33 candidates, including the vice-chairman of UGC have applied for the directors job.

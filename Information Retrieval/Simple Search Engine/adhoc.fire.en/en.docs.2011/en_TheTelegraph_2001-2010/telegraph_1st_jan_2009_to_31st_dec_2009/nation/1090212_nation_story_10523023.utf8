The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cheap fare flip-flop, at wag of finger
                                                                                                               Cheap fare flip-flop, at wag of finger
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                      Fair fare                          
	New Delhi, Feb. 11: Some airlines today brought back the low-priced tickets they had scrapped yesterday, following a government warning of strict action against any attempt at collusion to jack up prices.        
	This time, however, the low fares on advance bookings are limited to specific routes and the number of such tickets is very small, prompting agents and travel experts to say the move was an eyewash aimed at pacifying the government.         
	With todays revisions  few said it was a rollback  passengers flying low-cost carriers, such as IndiGo, on the Delhi-Calcutta route would have to pay Rs 4,925 on spot tickets. The fare will fall to Rs 2,926 if booked two-three months in advance.         
	The warning came from civil aviation minister Praful Patel, who said strict action would be taken against any formation of (a) pricing cartel (collusion). Our ministry is against any cartelisation among airlines. We will keep a watch and take strict action in any such case.         
	Yesterdays move had pushed up the average flying cost by Rs 1,200-2,000.         
	Soon after Patels warning, the directorate-general of civil aviation wrote to airlines asking for details of yesterdays hikes, officials said. Later, a senior official of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission, which probes unfair market practices such as cartelisation, suggested action would be taken if there was evidence of collusion. We have not studied the new fares yet but if we are convinced that there is a case of price-fixing, we have the power to take suo motu action against it (cartelisation).        
	Today, most airlines denied the charges of cartelisation and argued that the hike was necessary because the steep cuts in ticket prices last month had failed to attract sufficient number of passengers. The reductions of up to 50 per cent, helped by a cut in jet fuel prices, were aimed at luring more passengers after a 5 per cent decline in the number of fliers in 2008.        
	As he slammed private airlines, Patel tried to separate state-owned Air India from the others, saying the national carrier would never be a part of such cartelisation and would ensure better prices.         
	Yesterday, Air India said it had also withdrawn its promotional fares, because the response wasnt very good, but insisted its tickets would still cost 10 per cent less than those of full-service carriers like Kingfisher and Jet Airways. Today, an Air India spokesperson said a 10 per cent discount would be offered on the tickets purchased on its website.

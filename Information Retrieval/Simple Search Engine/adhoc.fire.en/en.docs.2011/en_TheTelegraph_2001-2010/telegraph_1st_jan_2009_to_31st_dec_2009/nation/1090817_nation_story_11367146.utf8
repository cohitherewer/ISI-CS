The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Kalam driver now lecturer 
                                                                                                               Kalam driver now lecturer 
                              Kathiresan. (PTI)                            
	Attur (Tamil Nadu), Aug. 16: If anyone tried to floor A.P.J. Abdul Kalam with a tricky question on politics, the former President may well retort: Hey, just ask my driver, even he knows it.        
	A school dropout who was Kalams driver in the late 1980s has become a college lecturer after earning a PhD in history and MAs in history and political science.        
	Kathiresan, 47, thanks the pep talks he received from Kalam at the Defence Research and Development Laboratory (DRDL), Hyderabad, where the technocrat was posted years before he became President. I worked as driver for ayya (sir) for five-and-a-half years. He is a very nice person, and is mainly responsible for the position I am in today, said Kathiresan, who joined the Arignar Anna Government Arts College on August 6.        
	That is more than even Albert Einsteins driver achieved. The story goes that Einsteins driver would sit at the back of the hall during his lectures and, after sometime, told the great scientist he could probably give the lecture himself now.        
	So they switched places, with Einstein sitting at the back in the drivers uniform. The driver gave the lecture flawlessly but when someone in the audience asked a question, he refused to be stumped: The answer is quite simple, I bet my driver, there at the back, could answer it.        
	Kathiresan learnt the answers himself. Studying by night, he cleared his Class X board exams, then his higher secondary, then his BA and MA in history from Madurai Kamaraj University, an MA in political science from Manonmaniam Sundaranar University in Tirunelveli, and finally his PhD.        
	Kathiresan said Kalam gave motivational talks to all DRDL employees, asking them to go the extra mile to achieve their dreams. I always had the urge to resume my studies which I was forced to discontinue after my fathers death. Ayyas words gave wings to my dreams.        
	Kathiresan had joined the army in 1979 and was trained as an electrical mechanic in Bhopal before being posted to the DRDL as Kalams driver. He left in 1996 to take up a job as supervisor for the chief education officer, Tirunelveli.        
	He said Kalam had replied to his letter after assuming office as President. I was touched when I got a reply from ayya. I had sent the letter to inform him that I had quit the DRDL and joined the CEOs office, Kathiresan said.        
	By then, he had become the President of India. I still have the letter with me.        
	Asked if he had spoken to Kalam after becoming a college lecturer, Kathiresan said: I will write to him. I did not call him because I dont want to disturb him. He is a very busy person who deals with thousands of people every day.                    WRITTEN WITH A PTI REPORT

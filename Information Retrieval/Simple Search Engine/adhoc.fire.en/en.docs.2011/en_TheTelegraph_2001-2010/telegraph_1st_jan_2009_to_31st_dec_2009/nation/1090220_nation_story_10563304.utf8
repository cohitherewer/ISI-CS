	Gaya, Feb. 19: A teacher and 42 girls of Government Middle School, Konch, were injured when walls and tiled roof of a classroom collapsed shortly before noon today.         
	Twenty-two of the injured were discharged after first-aid, while the others  including the teacher Mukti Shandilya  were referred to the Anugrah Narain Magadh Medical College Hospital, Gaya, about 30km from Konch. They are now out of danger.         
	The damage would have been much more had the mud-and-brick wall fallen inside the classroom, said district magistrate Sanjay Kumar, adding that he had ordered an inquiry. About 105 students were present when the roof collapsed.

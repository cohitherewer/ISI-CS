          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, March 23: The Orissa Board of Secondary Educations decision to do away with optional papers and revert to the earlier syllabus after one year of their introduction has had an unexpected fallout among high school text booksellers.        
	The Orissa Publishers and Booksellers Association has decided to stop procurement and sale of the text books prescribed for classes VIII, IX and X for the next academic session.        
	The booksellers are peeved about the hasty decision of the board to withdraw the new syllabus after one academic session as it had caused severe loss for the booksellers.        
	If the board does not come up with a decision addressing the plight of the booksellers by March 25, we will be forced to go on agitation and stop procurement of text books for the forthcoming academic session from the next day, association secretary Kalicharan Tripathy said.        
	The decision on this line was taken at a meeting of the associations executive body in Cuttack last week.         
	The members alleged that the board had notified dropping of the optional papers from the curriculum of Class IX and X students on August 28, over two months after issuing orders for sale of text books prescribed under the old syllabus.         
	The board had issued orders for sale of prescribed textbooks for classes VII, IX and X from June 30, 2008. In pursuance of the order, booksellers across the state procured the text books, including those for over a dozen optional subjects on payment of full amount towards price.        
	The BSE shouldnt have asked us to procure the textbooks if it was to drop the optional papers, the association secretary said.        
	In 2008, students were made to write the HSC examination under a new syllabus with two optional papers.

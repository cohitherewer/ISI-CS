The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Marriage breakdown no ground for divorce 
                                                                                                               Marriage breakdown no ground for divorce 
                            
	New Delhi, March 8 (PTI): The Supreme Court has ruled that a Hindu couple cannot be granted divorce on the ground of irretrievable breakdown of the marriage.        
	The ruling is significant because so far courts, including the Supreme Court, had granted divorce on this ground.        
	A bench of Justices Markandeya Katju and V.S. Sirpurkar said there were several grounds for granting a divorce, such as cruelty, adultery and desertion, but irretrievable breakdown of marriage is not mentioned in the Hindu Marriage Act.        
	The bench passed the order while dismissing the appeal of Vishnu Dutt Sharma who had sought divorce from his wife Manju Sharma on the ground that their marriage had irretrievably broken down. Manju, however, was not ready for divorce.        
	Vishnu filed the appeal in the apex court after a matrimonial court and Delhi High Court dismissed the plea. He cited a number of rulings by the apex court where couples had been granted divorce on the same ground and argued that there was no reason he should be refused.         
	But the judges said those cases had not considered the legal position mentioned above, and hence could not be precedents. A mere direction of the court without considering the legal position is not a precedent, they said.        
	If we grant divorce on the ground of irretrievable breakdown, then we shall be adding a clause to Section 13 of the Act that breakdown of the marriage is also a ground for divorce, the bench said.        
	But the court could not add such a ground for divorce since that would mean amending the law, which is a function of the legislature, the judges said. Only Parliament can amend the law, they added.

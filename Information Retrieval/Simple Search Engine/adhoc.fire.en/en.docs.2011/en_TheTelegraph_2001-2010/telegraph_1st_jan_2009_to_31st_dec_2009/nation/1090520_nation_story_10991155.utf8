The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Anti-Lalu rally in Patna
                                                                                                               Anti-Lalu rally in Patna
                            
	Patna, May 19 (PTI): Hundreds of party activists and a section of lawyers owing allegiance to the Congress today demonstrated here demanding that the RJD boss, Lalu Prasad, be kept out of the Union cabinet.        
	The Congress supporters assembled at Kargil Chowk near Gandhi Maidan and shouted anti-Lalu Prasad and anti-RJD slogans, urging UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to keep the leader out of the Union cabinet.         
	Meanwhile, state Congress president Anil Sharma said he had apprised Sonia Gandhi of the prevailing mood of Congress workers in the state and added that he had requested her to not include Lalu in the UPA government in the larger interest of the party in Bihar.         
	The exclusion of Lalu Prasad from the Union cabinet would send in the right signals and hasten the return of minorities, upper castes, EBCs and Dalits back into the Congress fold, Sharma said.         
	Adding insult to injury, Railway Protection Force (RPF) guarding Lalu Prasads bungalow in Patna was withdrawn today.         
	We withdrew our security personnel from the 10-Circular Road residence of Lalu Prasad this morning following instructions from the RPF headquarters, said a top RPF officer on condition of anonymity. Lalu Prasad was accorded Z-plus security by the Union home ministry.         
	On the other hand, the East Central Railway has also dismantled the outgoing railway ministers camp office near the bungalow. The bungalow, where Lalu Prasad and family stays, has been allotted to former chief minister and wife, Rabri Devi.

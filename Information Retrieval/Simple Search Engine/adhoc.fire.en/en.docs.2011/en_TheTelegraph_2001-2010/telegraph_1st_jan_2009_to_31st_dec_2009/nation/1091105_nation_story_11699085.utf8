	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 4: Swine flu scare gripped Sundergarh firmly as three more tribal students in a girls hostel tested positive for the H1N1 virus yesterday.         
	So far, five girls of the government-run district kanyashram have been tested positive. Following the confirmation, 20 girls have been kept in isolation. All the patients are being treated at Rajgangpur hospital and all are doing well, except two who have minor fever.         
	Moreover, 36 hostel girls manifesting the flu symptoms have been quarantined, said Sundergarh chief district medical officer (CDMO) Bikrant Kindo. Other students who were exposed to the infection have been traced and those who were exposed are being treated, said Kindo.        
	Paramedical staff, led by him, are camping at the site.        
	Meanwhile, an experts team from Bhubaneswar has arrived at the spot and working with the health administration to contain the situation. The virus that spreads faster during winter has been a cause for worry for the administration that is struggling to contain its spread.         
	Moreover, many of the 200 students, treated for fever, had left for their homes, causing further worry.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ship to Dhaka on Selja table
                                                                                                               Ship to Dhaka on Selja table
          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, June 3: If tourism minister Kumari Selja has her way, you could soon be boarding a ship from Calcutta and sailing all the way to Dhaka.        
	The Indian and Bangladesh tourism ministries are reported to be considering a proposal to re-open the Calcutta-Dhaka direct passenger ship route after 40 years, although the home ministry has its doubts.        
	Tourism ministry sources said such a route would be a huge draw as it would pass through the Sunderbans. But the Indian home ministry has expressed fears that it could pose huge security risks.        
	Such a shipping route will help passengers enjoy the beauty of the Sunderbans, the home of the Royal Bengal tiger. It is bound to be an exciting trip, a tourism ministry official said. If a train does not pose any security risks, then a ship service should not.        
	The official said informal discussions had been held between the neighbours and high-level talks were in the pipeline. Everything will have to be discussed, including the ports that will be touched and the frequency of travel.        
	Calcutta and Dhaka now have daily flights and road services as well as four trains a week. But there is no passenger service on the river routes that were snapped after the 1965 war.        
	Tourism officials said both countries had a river protocol and it was possible to bring passenger shipping under it. Dhaka and Delhi recently renewed their river trade and transit treaty for two years.        
	The neighbours are also exploring the feasibility of India using more river ports in Bangladesh to reach isolated parts of northeast India, the official said.        
	A standing committee of Bangladesh parliament had made similar recommendations recently. Committee chairman Noor-e-Alam Chowdhury had asked the government to find out ways to start direct passenger shipping services saying it would give ecotourism a boost.        
	He had said Bangladesh had a few British-era vessels that were still in good shape and could be used to ferry tourists.        
	Sources said the Bangladesh shipping ministry was willing to consider the proposal but had clarified that more talks would have to be held because the matter involved India.        
	The number of people travelling to India from Bangladesh has been growing over the years. The figure touched 5.58 lakh in 2008 from 5.36 lakh the year before. About 90,000 Indians travel to Bangladesh annually.

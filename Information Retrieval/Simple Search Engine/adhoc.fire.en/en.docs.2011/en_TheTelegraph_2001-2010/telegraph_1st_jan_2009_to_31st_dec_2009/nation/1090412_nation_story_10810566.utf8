                                                                                                               Look who can't wait for action to start
          ANANYA SENGUPTA IN NEW DELHI      
	An electorate two-and-a-half times Americas population, a month of marathon polling, over 200 parties and several thousand candidates  its a face of India not reflected in the steel-and-glass walls of IT offices.        
	But its a face the world apparently wants to understand, and so foreign journalists and TV crews have hit Indias potholed roads and dirt tracks, ready to showcase and demystify Election 2009 before a global audience.        
	If the BBC is said to be flying in celebrity journalist Nik Gowing and star news presenter Nisha Pillai, Al Jazeera  which shot to fame post-September 11 by broadcasting Osama bin Ladens statements  is bringing in David Frost and former BBC and CNN man Riz Khan of Q amp;A fame for its first-ever Indian poll coverage.        
	We are treating this on a par with the US presidential election, said Anmol Saxena, India bureau chief of Al Jazeera English. We are going all out this time, said the BBCs Sanjiv Srivastava.        
	French journalist Patrick de Jacquelot, who has been in this country for just seven months, said he was yet to come to grips with the intricacies of Indian politics.            
	For my readers and for me, the most fascinating aspect is that the election goes on for a month, he said. In our country, there is just one day for voting. It starts at 8am and by 8pm we know who has won. Its both difficult and challenging for me to explain the basics of elections here and for my readers to fathom it.  
	He said his paper, financial daily La Tribune, was so interested in this election because its readers were curious about Indias fast-growing economy.        
	Al Jazeeras Saxena said: We already have five teams on the road, which include 20 Indian journalists and programming people flown in from our Kuala Lumpur office. We go live from April 12.        
	The channel has commissioned stories in the US, UK and Malaysia to get feedback on the polls from NRIs, in Pakistan to get local reactions, and in China for takes on how the poll results may affect economic ties with India.        
	The Doha, Qatar-based network that reaches 140 million households in over 100 countries has a deal with Hindi channel India TV under which they can broadcast each others content. It has now applied for down-linking rights.        
	The BBC coverage will feature an India Election Train, which will take its reporters from Delhi to Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bhubaneswar, Calcutta, Patna and Allahabad between April 25 and May 13. Well concentrate on how the global meltdown has affected the urban-rural economy, on terror issues and on the mood among young voters. We shall have at least 50-60 reporters on the job, Srivastava said.        
	Time magazine will focus on the chaos that is coalition politics. Indian politics once used to be personality-driven. But now with coalition politics, personalities alone will not do. This kind of politics is harder for people outside India to grasp, said Time correspondent Jyoti Thottam.        
	De Jacquelot hopes to get an interview with Rahul Gandhi. So does Frost, known for his political satire and serious interviews of politicians, who is to arrive next week.        
	Al Jazeera hopes the celebrity status of Frost and Riz Khan will help bag interviews. Khan, who hosts the Riz Khan Show on Al Jazeera English where he interviews analysts and policy makers, will now anchor his shows from Delhi.        
	For the foreign journalist, though, the election is not just about the bigwigs. Indias size and colour, its caste, class and gender dynamics, the election logistics and the issues  as diverse as Marathi is from Meitei  will keep them busy and enthralled for the next few weeks.        
	Srivastava said what made Indian general elections interesting, and also difficult to cover, was that each state was like a separate country. There are no (central) themes. The 2004 elections were often called the sum of state elections; Election 2009 is Election 2004 many times over.        
	What excites him most about the polls?        
	As in life, so in politics  women are the most difficult to understand. I think the most exciting piece for me would be to write about Mayavati, Jayalalithaa, Mamata Banerjee and Sonia Gandhi, Srivastava said.        
	I dont know if we could really get up close and personal with them, but I would like to do a fly-on-the-wall story with them. People like Lalu Prasad have become predictable, but none of these women have yet opened up completely.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Strike call as TN braces for Lanka fallout
                                                                                                               Strike call as TN braces for Lanka fallout
          G.C. SHEKHAR                              
	Chennai, April 21: Tamil Nadu is bracing for the local impact of the final Lankan assault on Velupillai Prabhakaran, whose surrender deadline set by Colombo expired today, with the DMK announcing a general strike on April 23.        
	Political opinion is divided on how the state might react to the Tamil Tiger chiefs death or capture, but the public mood appears one of muted acceptance. Police and many politicians have ruled out sustained violence despite the MDMKs Vaiko threatening blood on the streets.        
	Unlike the shock that accompanied Rajiv Gandhis assassination, Prabhakarans end has been anticipated for the past few months, said H. Balakrishnan, a retired marine engineer. We knew that he would have to die either by the gun or by the cyanide pill.        
	Still, an anxious chief minister, M. Karunanidhi, today sent telegrams to Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi and foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee, insisting on a ceasefire ultimatum to Sri Lanka. The strike is also aimed at mounting pressure on the Centre.        
	So far, the war in Lanka is not an election issue but parties have been issuing statements to protect themselves from a possible backlash if the fall of the Tigers touches off a wave of sympathy in Tamil Nadu.         
	Karunanidhis recent assertion  which he later modified  that Prabhakaran was a good friend had surprised many since the two were never known to be close. The LTTE leader, rather, was close to Karunanidhis arch-rival, M.G. Ramachandran.        
	Only after MGRs death in 1987 did the outfit turn to Karunanidhi to pressure Delhi into withdrawing its peacekeeping force. After Rajiv Gandhis assassination, Karunanidhi used the Tiger card to expel Vaiko, latching on to a vague intelligence warning that the LTTE planned to kill him and install Vaiko in his place.        
	Karunanidhis statement on Prabhakaran and the strike call are part of efforts to ensure the DMK is on the right side of public sentiment if Lanka were to become a poll issue. As a ruling party which also shares power at the Centre, the DMK could otherwise bear the brunt of any backlash if a perception gains ground that the party did not do enough to protect Tamil interests in Lanka.        
	However, an intelligence official said even if the pro-LTTE fringe groups reacted violently, it was likely to be sporadic. Only if the protests get out of hand and affect public life can it spell trouble for the DMK.        
	The Coimbatore blasts of 1998 had hurt the DMK at the Lok Sabha polls that followed.         
	The good news is that colleges  instant rallying points  are shut and the high court, where lawyers had rioted on the Lanka issue, too will close for vacation soon. The police, though, have mentioned central government offices and the Sri Lankan deputy high commission as possible targets.        
	Some Congress leaders, facing propaganda against Delhis failure to intervene, fear becoming physical targets. Well advise our national leaders not to risk coming to Tamil Nadu if theres escalating violence, a party official said.        
	A Union minister from the Congress, though, didnt expect extreme reactions. He cited how Karunanidhi had to retract his statement on Prabhakaran by saying he had not forgiven the Tigers for Rajivs assassination. Im sure the public continues to feel similarly.        
	Priyanka stand         
	Priyanka Gandhi today said India as a nation could not forgive Prabhakaran for killing Rajiv Gandhi although she and her family did not have any hatred or anger against her fathers killers, PTI said.        
	Asked if she had forgiven Nalini, a convict in the assassination whom she had met in jail, Priyanka said: I am like Nalini. I am a human being. One human being cannot forgive another human being.        
	Asked how she wanted Prabhakaran treated if handed over to India, she said: This issue is both political and personal for me. I fully understand (that) politically, the former Prime Minister of India was assassinated and they (the LTTE) cannot be pardoned by India as a nation.        
	She added: From the point of view of humanity, I have nothing against them in my heart... neither anger nor hatred.

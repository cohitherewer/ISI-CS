                                                                                                               Nimbus bags cricket deal till 2014
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Oct. 20: Nimbus Communications Ltd, which owns the Neo Sports and Neo Cricket channels, is once again the Indian cricket boards chosen broadcaster for all domestic and international matches in the country between 2010 and 2014.        
	The decision to renew the deal with Nimbus was taken at a meeting of the marketing committee of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in Mumbai today.         
	The meeting, the all-powerful panels first in over a year, was presided over by board president Shashank Manohar.        
	The committee also decided to call for fresh tenders for team sponsorship as Sahara, the current sponsor, is not keen to renew its contract, which ends in March 2010.        
	Nimbuss earlier contract had a first-refusal clause that allowed the BCCI to renew the deal without a tender.        
	Under the new deal, Nimbus will pay the BCCI Rs 31.5 crore for the telecast of every international match played in India  Test, one-day international or T20  as against the Rs 27 crore-per-match deal it had inked in 2006. The deal will, however, not extend to the Indian Premier League, whose broadcast rights are with Sony, or ICC events such as the World Cup, which will be telecast on ESPN-STAR Sports.        
	In all, Nimbus will pay the BCCI well over Rs 2,000 crore for airing all the matches organised by the board in India from 2010 to 2014. The network will shell out to the board guarantee money of Rs 660 crore by January 2010.        
	Nimbus had entered into a Rs 2,755-crore telecast deal with the BCCI in 2006 for four years. A year later, the relationship between the two had come under strain over the issue of encryption and sharing of live feed with Doordarshan.         
	A law, passed in March 2007, on mandatory sharing of sports feed with the national broadcaster had resulted in a significant revenue loss for Nimbus.        
	Nimbus posted losses of Rs 140-Rs 150 crore in 2006-2007 alone because of that, a Nimbus source said.        
	But some powerful friends in the BCCI had made it possible for Nimbus to offload some of its revenue losses on the cricket board.        
	As a result, the BCCI compensated Nimbus for Rs 257 crore from the total amount. Nimbus also managed a further reduction of about Rs 200 crore following some cancelled matches in 2007.        
	Later, more concessions were given to Nimbus at various points, bringing down the total match fee it paid to the BCCI.        
	As in the last contract, domestic cricket features in a big way in the new deal. It will be binding on the rights-winner to ensure live coverage of at least 52 days of domestic cricket in the first year and 72 days each in the second, third and fourth years.

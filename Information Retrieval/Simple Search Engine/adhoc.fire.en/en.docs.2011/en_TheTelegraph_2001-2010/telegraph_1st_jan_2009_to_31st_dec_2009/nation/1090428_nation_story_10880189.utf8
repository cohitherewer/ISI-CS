The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Kosi effect on polls
                                                                                                               Kosi effect on polls
          GAUTAM SARKAR                              
	Saharsa, April 27: Incidents surrounding the August 2008 Bihar floods will determine the politics in the fourth phase of polls scheduled on April 30, 2009.        
	The Congress and RJD-LJP combination have much at stake in this round, while an undivided NDA camp plays its development card in Katihar, Kisanganj, Purnea, Khagaria, Madhepura and Supaul seats on the Kosi basin.         
	Voters here are yet to recover from the devastating floods and remain reluctant to play the political tug-of-war. We were disappointed when Rahul Gandi spoke on how other parties have failed to tackle the flood, but uttered nothing substantial, said a resident of Araria. At Araria and Saharsa Gandhi addresed poll meetings on April 25.         
	Even NDA allies have much at stake as people charged politicians for playing games. What development, do you see? Do you see any good roads? The government has done little for us even after eight months. Every one is busy blaming each other. But words do little, said Bindo Yadav, a social worker at Madhepura.         
	He alleged that not a single political party is yet to put flood-related issues in its poll agenda. Threat of Naxalite violence loomed large over the three phases of elections in Bihar. The fourth and final phase would be an acid test for districts such as Supaul and Madhepura where Maoists have declared liberated zones.

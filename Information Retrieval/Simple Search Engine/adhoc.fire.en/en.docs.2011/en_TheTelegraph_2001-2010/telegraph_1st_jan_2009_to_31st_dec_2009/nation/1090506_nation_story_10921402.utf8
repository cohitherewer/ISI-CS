The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rahul drives Lalu up the wall
                                                                                                               Rahul drives Lalu up the wall
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, May 5: Rahul Gandhis unprovoked praise for Nitish Kumar earned him no more than a polite thank you from the Bihar chief minister and no less than angered barbs from Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan.        
	Irate at Rahuls endorsement of Nitish Kumars development record, Lalu Prasad said in Bihar: I do not understand what this man is up to, what can I say? Nitish has done no good in Bihar, he is with communal forces, but I cannot speak for what the Congress general secretary has said. I am not in the Congress.        
	Paswan was more cryptic, but equally caustic. If Rahul Gandhi really thinks Nitish Kumar is doing great work, why has his party put up candidates against him?         
	Speculation over an incipient Congress-Nitish alliance has been swirling for weeks, although the Bihar chief minister has denied suggestions of a secret deal.        
	The souring of relations among the UPA allies has run consistent to reports from the field that Nitish is set to hand a drubbing to Lalu Prasad and Paswan in Bihar. It is also known that Nitish has been politically and ideologically uncomfortable with the BJP.        
	Left cold        
	The CPM and the CPI appeared cold to alliance overtures from Rahul.         
	As far as we are concerned, our objective is to achieve a combination of non-Congress, non-BJP secular parties. All other issues can be taken up post-elections, CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said.        
	CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan said: I dont think the Left will oblige them (Congress) this time. They are nervous about the results.

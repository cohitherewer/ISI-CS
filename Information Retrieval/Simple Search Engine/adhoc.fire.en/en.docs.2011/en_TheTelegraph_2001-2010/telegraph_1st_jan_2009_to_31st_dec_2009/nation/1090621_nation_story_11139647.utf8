The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Intruder jet takes off
                                                                                                               Intruder jet takes off
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                                                The US military cargo aircraft at Mumbai airport.      
	Mumbai, June 20: The US military plane loaded with arsenal which inadvertently entered Indian air space last night took off following diplomatic intervention, but defence officials are miffed at the crews initial insistence that it was a civilian aircraft.        
	Officials of the Indian Air Force and directorate-general of civil aviation, who interrogated the 18 people on board the plane for violating Indian air space, refused to reveal the outcome of the questioning.        
	The AN-124 aircraft took off around 10pm from Mumbai airport tonight. The plane was travelling from Diego Garcia, a US military base near the Maldives, to Kandahar in Afghanistan.        
	The decision to let them go was taken after the US embassy stepped in and senior diplomats got in touch with the external affairs ministry, saying the intrusion was an inadvertent mistake of the flight operator, a senior intelligence official said.        
	The operator had obtained permission from the director-general of civil aviation. But it did not have either a defence clearance or special permission from the air force that is required for any foreign military aircraft flying over India.        
	Sources said following intervention from the US authorities, the 18 persons were put up at the five-star Sahara Star hotel near the airport.        
	The AN-124, the second- largest heavy transport aircraft manufactured by the Ukrainian Antonov company, carried the Nato codename Condor.         
	The crew said they werent aware about seeking special permission to transport military equipment. They have been let off with a warning, a civil aviation ministry spokesperson said.        
	But defence officials involved in the questioning of the crew are miffed.        
	When seeking permission from the defence ministry, the aircraft identified itself as a civil plane on a charter operation. However, when applying to enter Pakistani airspace from India, it identified itself as a defence aircraft. Anyway, because of diplomatic intervention they were let off, an air force source said.        
	The plane is owned by the Volga-Dnepr Group, a Russian company based in Ulyanovsk. The aircraft was on lease to the US military.

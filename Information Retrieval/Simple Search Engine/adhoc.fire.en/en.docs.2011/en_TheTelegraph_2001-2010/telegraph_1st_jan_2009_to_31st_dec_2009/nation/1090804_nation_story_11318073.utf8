                                                                                                               Ragging axe on Delhi boys 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 3: A Delhi University college today expelled two final-year students barely hours after a first-year student alleged ragging, in the first known case where new anti-ragging regulations have been implemented.         
	Kirori Mal College today asked two final-year undergraduate students to stay away from college and registered a police complaint against them, based on the complaint of ragging last evening.         
	But the accused students complained that the junior overreacted to what was an attempt to get to know him better, and that the college never heard their version of events.         
	This (action) was needed to set a tough example so that other seniors do not rag juniors, the college principal, professor Bhim Singh, told reporters at the institute today.         
	It is a serious decision which I know can damage the careers of the accused students. But it is necessary.         
	The action was taken under the UGC regulations against ragging notified last month that require college authorities to promptly convene a meet of the college anti-ragging committee.         
	This committee met today but neither the accused nor the complainant appeared before the panel, Singh said. The complainant was shocked and spoke to him over the phone, the principal said.         
	The complainant has alleged that the two accused students  Akshay Chaudhary and Hanif Mohammed  ragged him in their hostel room last evening around 7.30pm.         
	A complaint was registered with the hostel warden who informed the principal.         
	But the two accused boys claimed they were never heard, either by the warden or the principal. We have been punished without a hearing. It is unfair, Hanif said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 2: Parallel rallies marked the third anniversary of the police firing at Kalinga Nagar industrial hub (Jajpur) that claimed 14 tribals, three years ago.         
	Visthapan Virodhi Jana Manch, the organisation that is spearheading the agitation against a proposed Tata Steel plant, organised a maha samabesh, attended by 5,000 delegates from places like Orissa, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh and Bengal.        
	The delegates represented parties such as CPI(ML), CPI ML (Liberation), CPM, Adivasi Ekta Manch and Naxalite frontal organisations.        
	Representatives of anti-displacement bodies, which have been opposing steel plants proposed by Posco and ArcelorMittal and alumina refinery and bauxite mining projects proposed by Vedanta Group, also took part in the rallies and meetings.         
	The delegates expressed solidarity with the anti-displacement movement in Kalinga Nagar and vowed not to allow the Tata Steel project to come up.         
	Members of Visthapan Virodhi Jana Manch had been blocking the Daitari-Paradip Express Highway since January 2, 2006, till March 9, 2007, to protest against the displacement of tribal members and the police firing. The blockade was lifted following a high court order. The manch members took out a rally today from the firing spot in Champakoila village, to pay tribute to all those who had sacrificed their lives for the cause.

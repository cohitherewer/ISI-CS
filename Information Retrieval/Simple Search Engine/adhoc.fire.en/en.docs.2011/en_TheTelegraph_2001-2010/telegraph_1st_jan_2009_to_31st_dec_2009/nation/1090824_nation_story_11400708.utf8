The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Advani loses figure of speech   Aide quits, election team breaks up
                                                                                                               Advani loses figure of speech     -  Aide quits, election team breaks up
          SANJAY K. JHA                                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 23: L.K. Advanis team of aides that played a key role during the last general election appears to have broken up.        
	All these advisers have fallen out with the leadership on the issues of ideological rigidity and the nature of the BJP-RSS relationship.        
	Key Advani aide Sudheendra Kulkarni today formally snapped his active association with the BJP. Journalist Swapan Dasgupta has launched a scathing attack on the party leadership for expelling Jaswant Singh, and Chandan Mitra is being blamed for the Bal Apte committee report  which attributed the poll defeat to the Advani-centric campaign  even as the party now dismisses the report as non-existent.        
	Several other advisers of the BJP, political and apolitical, say in private conversation that Advani has overreached himself by promising to continue as leader of the Opposition for the next five years.        
	Kulkarni, technically not a BJP member since 2005, headed the think tank that ran Advanis campaign for Prime Minister. He also wrote Advanis speeches and was primarily responsible for their liberal content, including the praise for Mohammad Ali Jinnah during his 2005 Pakistan visit.        
	Although Kulkarni said he was parting ways because of ideological differences, Jaswant claimed he had been persuaded to resign.        
	The BJP had a few weeks ago virtually disowned Kulkarni, who had written several articles after the election results suggesting Advani had been weakened by infighting and RSS interference. Sushma Swaraj had then told the media that Kulkarni had nothing to do with the party.        
	But Advani did not disown Kulkarni, who attended the release of the Urdu version of the leaders book, My Country My Life, early this month.        
	It is now obvious that Advani was ready to tolerate Kulkarnis attack on the RSS but did not want him any more when he said the views expressed by Jaswant and Advani on Jinnah had no essential difference.        
	Kulkarni criticised Jaswants expulsion as graceless. Claiming he would not be able to make any meaningful contribution to the party, Kulkarni said he needed the freedom to express his views and be sincere to his convictions.        
	Dasgupta, who was on the BJPs strategy committee for the general election, has ridiculed the perverse symbolism of sacking somebody for writing a book. He has also argued the BJP needs autonomy from the RSS and suggested a moderate agenda for the future despite being a Narendra Modi supporter. He has asserted that Advani should vacate the space for a younger leader.        
	Fellow journalist Mitra, a member of the committee that drafted the Apte report, has joined the chorus rejecting the existence of the report. Yet, middle-rung leaders who did not attend the chintan baithak keep asking reporters for a copy of the report.        
	Mitra, who has defended the expulsion of Jaswant, hasnt appeared too inclined to defend Advani against Jaswants damning charges. Asked about Jaswants allegation that Advani had lied about his role in the Kandahar terrorist trade-off, he said people could judge for themselves since both politicians had made their claims on camera.

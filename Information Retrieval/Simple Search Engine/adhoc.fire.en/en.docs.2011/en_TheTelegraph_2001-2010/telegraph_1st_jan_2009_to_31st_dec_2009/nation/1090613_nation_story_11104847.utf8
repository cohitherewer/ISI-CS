                                                                                                               PM-Zardari meet 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, June 12: Manmohan Singh will meet Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari for the first time since the Mumbai attack in Russia next week.        
	The Prime Minister will be travelling to the Russian city of Yekaterinburg on June 15 for a three-day visit during which he will attend the Shanghai Co-operation Summit and the Brazil-Russia-India-China (Bric) Summit. This will be his first trip abroad after being sworn in for the second term.        
	Zardari will be there for the gathering of the Shanghai Co-operation in which Pakistan, like India, enjoys the status of an observer.        
	Although it wasnt clear whether the two leaders would meet on the sidelines or hold a one-on-one, expectations have grown of some ice-breaking talks. They will be at the same place at the same time... they will meet, they will shake hands, foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon said today. He didnt specify if a structured meeting was on the cards.        
	Menon also would not be drawn on the issues they were likely to discuss. I dont want to guess what they will discuss, he added.        
	This will be the first time the top leadership of the two countries will be coming face to face since the 26/11 terror strike, blamed on terrorists based in Pakistan.

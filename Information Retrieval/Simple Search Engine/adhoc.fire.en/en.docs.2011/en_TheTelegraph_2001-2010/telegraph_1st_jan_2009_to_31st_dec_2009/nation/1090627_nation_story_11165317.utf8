The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PC drives through Orissa rebel zone 
                                                                                                               PC drives through Orissa rebel zone 
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                          Chidambaram                                  
	Kandhamal, June 26: P. Chidambaram today shrugged off warnings of possible explosions to travel 30km by road to a Maoist stronghold in riot-scarred Kandhamal while Orissa police stayed on tenterhooks.        
	The police didnt know whether to be motivated or scared as they watched the home minister drive through the area despite warnings of improvised explosive devices.        
	We gave a written request that he should travel only by a chopper to Phulbani (the Kandhamal district headquarters) but he wouldnt change his mind, said a senior officer.        
	No sooner did Chidambaram land at Raikia, one of the worst affected places in last Augusts riots, on their way from Koraput in a BSF chopper than the cops sensed they were in for a tough few hours ahead.        
	The 30km between Raikia and Udayagiri block, on the way to Phulbani, are deemed unsafe because of Maoist presence.         
	Chidambarams convoy had a dozen vehicles, including his white Ambassador. Worried policemen even placed a rickety jeep ahead of the pilot vehicle to ensure it bears the brunt of a possible blast. Fortunately, no incident took place.         
	He was determined to travel by road and see things for himself, said a close aide to the minister.         
	In spite of having a smooth trip, the minister sensed all was not well: he didnt come across a single political party worker in the district.        
	There is a vacuum where Naxalites have stepped in, said the home minister, suggesting the Maoists had stepped in to fill the void.        
	Chidambaram eventually visited three relief camps and a village where Hindus and Christians had returned to build homes, damaged during the riots, together.        
	Kandhamal has been exploited by the Maoists in the wake of the violence between the Christian Panaas and the Hindu Kondha tribals. As Hindu hard-line groups stepped in, the decades-old ethnic divide exploded into communal riots.

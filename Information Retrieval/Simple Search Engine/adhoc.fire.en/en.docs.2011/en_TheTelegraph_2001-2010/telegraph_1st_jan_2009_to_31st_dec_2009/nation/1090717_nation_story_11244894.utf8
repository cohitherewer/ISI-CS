          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, July 16: Rising water level in tributaries of the Mahanadi system in lower catchment areas has triggered panic in coastal Orissa.        
	So far, flash floods and incessant rain have claimed 23 lives in Orissa, disaster management minister Surya Narayan Patro said in the Assembly today. The highest number of casualty has been reported from Nayagarh where a bus fell off a bridge killing seven passengers. Another three died when a wall collapsed due to the rain.        
	Three persons died each in Keonjhar, Kandhamal and Koraput, swept away by flash floods. Two deaths were reported in Ganjam, while two persons died in Bhadrak and Cuttack.        
	Patro said collectors of all districts located on the river basin had been alerted and asked to keep themselves prepared for the eventuality.         
	Water level in the Mahanadi and its tributaries today showed a rising trend.         
	At Naraj, the Mahanadi is already running at 25.68m (0.27m above the warning level of 25.41m) and approaching the danger level of 26.41m, official sources said. Hirakud reservoir built on the Mahanadi is now receiving 1,69.499 cusecs of water, while its outflow is 35,310 cusecs. The water level at Hirakud stood at 607.19-ft against its maximum capacity of 630-ft and none of the sluice gates had been opened.        
	Latest recordings indicated flow of 406,000 cusecs at Khairamal and 613,000 cusecs at Barmul, while it was over 637,585 cusecs further down at Mundali before Naraj.         
	The Mahanadi delta has a network of 3,924km of river embankments of Mahanadi, Luna, Chitrotpala, Kathajodi, Daya, Bhargavi, Kushabhadra and Devi spread over Cuttack, Kendrapada, Jagatsinghpur, Puri, Khurda and Nayagarh.         
	The condition of the embankment network has turned vulnerable due to breaches, which have not been plugged since 1982, except for routine repair after floods, a survey revealed. Meanwhile, floods have submerged 7,000 hectares in the state.         
	Including 6,400 hectares in Nayagarh and 250 hectares in Jagatsinghpur.         
	Heavy rains had slowed the cargo handling operation at Paradip port, 90km from here. Cargo shipment and discharge has been affected for the past two to three days, a port official said.

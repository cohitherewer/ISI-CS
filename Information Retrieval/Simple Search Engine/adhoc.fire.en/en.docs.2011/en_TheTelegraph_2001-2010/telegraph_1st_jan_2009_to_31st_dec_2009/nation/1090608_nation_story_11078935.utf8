                                                                                                               Kashmir rape FIR
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Srinagar, June 7: A forensic report has confirmed that the two women who were found dead last month in south Kashmirs Shopian were raped, prompting police to lodge an FIR.         
	Although the state government had claimed Neelofar Jan, 25, and her sister-in-law Asiya, 18, had drowned, the incident had led to violent protests with people blaming security forces for the rape and murders.        
	Hurriyat leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani has asked people to join a march to Shopian tomorrow to put pressure on the government.

          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 12: Nitin Gadkari, a member of the Maharashtra legislative council, has emerged the front runner for BJP president.        
	The organisational polls that precede the election to the top job are expected to be over by December 15 with the election of state, district and block presidents. These officials will be part of the electoral college that will elect a successor to Rajnath Singh.         
	Gadkari was in the capital today. He met Ramlal, the BJPs organising secretary and its main interface with the RSS. There were unconfirmed reports that he called on RSS chief Mohanrao Bhagwat.        
	Apart from being able to meet Bhagwats desire for a generation change in the BJP  Gadkari is 52  he enjoys proximity to the Sangh chief going back to their days as swayamsevaks at the RSS headquarters in Nagpur.         
	If Gadkari makes it, he will be the first entrepreneur to head a major national party. He is the founder-chairman of Polysack Industrial Society, which makes PVC pipes; the promoter of Nikhil Furnitures and Appliances, which makes steel furniture; and a fruit exporter.        
	Publicly, though, Gadkari suggests he isnt eyeing the top job. I was never in any race, nor tried to be in one.        
	Asked what his vision for the BJP was, he said: Whatever I have to say will be said at an appropriate forum.        
	Bhagwat has conveyed his choice of Gadkari to L.K. Advani and Rajnath. Sangh sources said Bhagwat was keen on a person who was not flashy or individualistic.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CHALK amp; cheese   Mamata, Rabin in uneven fight
                                                                                                               CHALK amp; CHEESE     -  Mamata, Rabin in uneven fight
          DEVADEEP PUROHIT IN CALCUTTA SOUTH                        Mamata at a rally in Calcutta South. (Amit Datta)				             Deb sets out to campaign. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                      
	The contestants are as different in stature as in style. They could almost be fighting two different battles.        
	Mamata Banerjee has a long list of adversaries, not least among them her anti-industry image and her past association with the BJP. And with the Marxists treating Calcutta South as a prestige battle, she has to fight off star campaigners featuring the whos who of the CPM politburo and central committee.        
	Rabin Deb is fighting only one adversary: Mamata.        
	With change on his lips, the CPM candidate has been ploughing through every inch of the constituency for over two months, putting in 16 to 18 hours a day to reach out to the 15 lakh voters.        
	Mamata has to squeeze out time from her busy schedule to campaign in her own constituency.        
	In contrast to Debs intensive door-to-door campaign, she has made whirlwind tours of the seven Assembly segments: Kasba, Behala (East), Behala (West), Calcutta Port, Bhowanipore, Rashbehari and Ballygunge. She has to campaign for other party candidates, too.        
	Despite the time constraint, I have covered almost 90 per cent of the constituency, Mamata says while rushing to a meeting in Behala that is to be followed by a joint rally with state Congress chief Pranab Mukherjee.        
	According to a senior Trinamul leader, Mamata decides the venues of her rallies and roadshows after discussions with party colleagues, and makes an entry into a small notebook that she always carries with her.        
	After the ritual touching of her mothers feet before leaving home, Mamata makes several calls to local leaders. Its been like this for more than two months, she says, explaining the reason for her sore throat, before zooming off in a black Santro.        
	Deb, who had lost to the Trinamul chief by 98,000 votes in 2004, can go on and on about Mamatas misdeeds and how the state is suffering because of her.        
	She has done nothing for the constituency and she is at the forefront of all anti-development activities in the state. Its time the voters rejected her, he says.        
	But he refuses to predict the outcome and, in a candid chat, reveals one of his biggest worries  an unusual one for a candidate from a party known for organisational strength and cadre motivation.        
	Many of our supporters have lost the battle even before the election. I am trying to motivate them, Deb says.        
	His comrades, from party general secretary Prakash Karat to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, are reiterating the issues.        
	In minority-dominated Kidderpore, Karat has reminded voters about Mamatas past association with the BJP. Bhattacharjee and his industries minister, Nirupam Sen, have told Kasba and Dhakuria how Mamatas politics has put the brakes on Bengals industrialisation.        
	But the Trinamul leader is no greenhorn at swatting away such charges.        
	I will not be with the BJP after the elections, she says, flanked by Rizwanur Rahmans brother Rukbanur and his wife Zahida, at a roadshow in Garden Reach.        
	What CPM leaders call her misdeeds, Mamata sells as her strengths. We have saved the farmers of Singur and Nandigram, she says in Dhakurias Kalupara. She weaves in a slew of local issues  unemployment, industrial closure and the plight of primary teachers  sharpening the attack on the state government.        
	In almost every speech, she rolls out a long list of things she has made up her mind to oppose  unfettered invasion by foreign capital in key sectors, land acquisition, privatisation in insurance, divestment of public sector units, big-format retail.        
	Our party was the first to raise its voice on these issues. Now she has started saying the same things, Deb grumbles.        
	Is she stealing the CPMs planks? Mamata has a ready rebuttal: They (CPM) have forgotten Marx, Lenin and Stalin. They talk only about Tata these days.        
	The ruling party has put up hoardings and banners across the primarily urban constituency, blaming Mamata for the Nanos shift to Sanand.        
	Mamata has been winning here for the past 18 years, but given the seats urban character, the Nano shift has the potential of denting her vote bank, says Souvik Banerjee, an executive in his early 30s.        
	Delimitation has increased the diversity of the electorate in Calcutta South, which includes 56 wards of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and two gram panchayats. Around 20 per cent of the voters are Muslims, and there is a significant presence of Sikhs, Gujaratis and Marwaris.        
	CPM leaders are holding up Mamatas anti-industry stance at their Q amp;A sessions and meetings with residents of highrises and apartment complexes  an innovation introduced this election. But Trinamul leaders are not worried.        
	She derives her support from her image as the sole crusader for the downtrodden. She is acceptable to everyone. A projects relocation from Bengal can hardly affect her popularity, claims Trinamuls Partha Chatterjee.        
	Deb claims he has received a hint of voters disenchantment with Mamata during campaigning. I am making repeat visits across my constituency and telling people to give us a chance to serve them.        
	But even his most ardent supporters admit that their only realistic goal is to try and narrow the margin. The optimists among them believe the inclusion of Behala and Calcutta Port could slash Mamatas margin by at least 30,000.        
	The CPM had influenced delimitation and added Assembly segments where they have strong support, claims Chatterjee. But the Mamata wave has changed all that. We will win with a bigger margin because we will also get the Congress votes this time.

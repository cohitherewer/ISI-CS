	Gaya, May 3: When you cannot get an eligible groom, kidnap one.         
	A 15-year-old was allegedly abducted on Sunday morning for a forced wedding and two persons, who were protesting against the incident, were run over by a tractor on NH-83 near Belaganj, the Gaya block headquarters.         
	According to reports, two motorcycle-borne kidnappers kidnapped Lal Babu, a Class X student, as soon as he came out of a tuition centre in Lodipur village under Belaganj police station area. For a smooth escape, the abductors randomly fired, critically injuring a villager, Praveen Kumar.         
	Praveen was first taken to the Anugrah Narain Magadh Medical College Hospital and was subsequently referred to the Patna Medical College and Hospital.        
	As villagers blocked the national highway to protest against the abduction, a tractor driver lost control over his vehicle and ran over the protesters, a woman and a child, crushing them to death.        
	More than six persons sustained injuries in the incident and were admitted to Anugrah Narain Magadh Medical College Hospital.         
	Infuriated villagers then torched the tractor and broke glass panes of passing vehicles.         
	Confirming the incidents, the deputy superintendent of police Rajvansh Singh said that the boy was abducted as a potential groom.         
	Singh also added that one of the men involved in the abduction was nabbed and raids were being conducted on the basis of interrogations to find the kidnapped boy. The man arrested on charge of abduction has been identified as Surindra Yadav.

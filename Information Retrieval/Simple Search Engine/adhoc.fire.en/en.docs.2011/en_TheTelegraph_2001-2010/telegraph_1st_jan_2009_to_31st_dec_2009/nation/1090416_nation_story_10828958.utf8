The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Son guards Deshmukh fief
                                                                                                               Son guards Deshmukh fief
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI IN LATUR                        Amit				                                 
	A burst of firecrackers greets his arrival at Pohregaon village, 40km from Latur, and the crowd of around 3,000 farmers breaks into an excited chatter.        
	It is past 9pm, and nearby villages are dark, but Pohregaon is waiting to see and hear Amit Bhaiyya.        
	Meet Amit Deshmukh, Vilasrao Deshmukhs elder son, less known nationally compared to his film star brother Ritesh but the undisputed heir to his fathers legacy.        
	In Latur, where he is Amit Bhaiyya to kids and old farmers alike, junior Deshmukh appears to have already created his own niche.        
	With his twice-chief minister father roaming across Maharashtra, quelling inner party dissent in Vidarbha and hatching plans to improve the Congress-NCP-Republican Party of India tally, Amit is the man in charge here.        
	Papa is travelling across the state, so I am going to focus on Latur, where our family has worked for decades. Someone needs to be here, Amit smiles, speaking to The Telegraph while sipping coffee after the campaign in Pohregaon.        
	He shares his fathers deep voice. His brother has been successful in out-and-out comedy roles but Amit shares his fathers wry humour, which he uses to gently mock opponents. He rolls his eyes occasionally while speaking, and wags his finger when making a point.        
	Vilasraos fief Latur has traditionally voted for the Congress. But in 2004, it handed Shivraj Patil defeat. After Patil was forced to quit as home minister following last years Mumbai terror attacks, the joke here was that Latur knew Patils worth before Delhi did.        
	But these elections are no joke for the Deshmukh family  far from it.        
	Vilasrao, too, had to quit as chief minister in the aftermath of Mumbai, and any electoral embarrassment for the Congress in Latur could further dent his status as the tallest leader of the party in the state.        
	So Amit leaves home at 9.30am every day, attending three or four rallies and sabhas by early afternoon, when the heat forces political activity to a temporary halt.        
	Once the sun starts offering some respite, the elder Deshmukh son is back on the campaign trail, holding forth at another three rallies to complete seven or eight in a day.        
	The seat has been reserved for Scheduled Castes following the recent delimitation exercise, robbing Patil a chance to avenge defeat. Instead, the Congress has fielded Jaywant Awale, a senior state party leader but an outsider.        
	The Opposition BJP-Shiv Sena alliance, which is fielding a local, Sunil Gaekwad, has been seeking votes arguing that Awale would be unable to tackle their concerns since he did not belong to Latur.        
	Thats a ridiculous argument. The BJP called Sonia Gandhi an outsider but she has turned around the fortunes of the Congress party since taking over, says Amit, to cheering supporters at Pohregaon.         
	So when did Amit Deshmukh decide to enter his fathers trade? I have been working here (in Latur) since I completed college, comes the reply.        
	Amit, the chief of the Maharashtra Youth Congress, frequently mentions Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi in his speeches at Pohregaon. Who would you prefer to take a young nation forward? Rahul Gandhi, 38, or the octogenarian Lal Krishna Advani? he asks the crowd.         
	The answer to that question will only be known on May 16.  
	Latur votes on April 23

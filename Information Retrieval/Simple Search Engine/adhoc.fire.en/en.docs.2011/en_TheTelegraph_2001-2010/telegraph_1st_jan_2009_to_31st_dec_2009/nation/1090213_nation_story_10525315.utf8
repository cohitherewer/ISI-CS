The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lalu to shower rail blessings on home turf
                                                                                                               Lalu to shower rail blessings on home turf

	Patna, Feb. 12: Thawe, a nondescript village on the Siwan-Gopalganj road, is only known for its ancient Kali temple which Lalu Prasad, among several other politicians, visits to seek the goddesss blessings.         
	But now Thawe, en route to Selarkela (Rabri Devis village) and Phulwaria (his home), is all set to figure prominently in the countrys railway map as the Union minister is rewarding it with the status of a railway division.        
	This and a lot more is coming Bihars way when Lalu Prasad presents his interim railway budget in Parliament tomorrow, according to railway board sources close to the minister.         
	Lalus pre-election budget, according to the sources, also proposes to set up another railway division at Bhagalpur  a prominent city and already a railway junction  given its cultural roots and position as a centre for silk trade and weaving.         
	By now the nation is used to railway ministers and their soft corner for their respective home states. During his tenure, Lalu has been more than generous to Bihar, and most of the times at the cost of other states, namely neighbouring Jharkhand.         
	He has already set up a railway halt at Selarkala which is barely a kilometer away from Phulwaria which got a swanky railway station last year.         
	Now Laluji wishes to honour the place of his favourite goddess who has blessed him with popularity and power by setting up a railway division at Thawe, said a proud supporter.         
	Lalu is also likely to maintain his track record of running a profitable railway as the interim budget is likely to show an astronomical increase in the annual turnover from Rs 35,000 crore to Rs 1 lakh crore.         
	Also, given that Lau is in full-fledged election mode, he is unlikely to hike passenger fairs.         
	For Bihar specifically, the interim budget is likely to propose a number of fast trains on the Sitamarhi-Delhi, Jay Nagar-Ranchi and Dhanbad-Mumbai routes.         
	The Calcutta-Darbhanga Express up to Sitamarhi is likely to be extended. The weekly frequency of the Muzaffapur-Yashwant Nagar Express and Patna-Secunderabad Express is likely to be increased. An inter-city express between Patna and Buxar, too, is likely to be introduced.        
	Sources maintained that the frequency of Guwahati-New Delhi Rajdhani Express via Barauni and Muzaffapur would also be increased.         
	Lalu Prasad is also likely to win over South Indians working or settled in Bihar by giving in to their long-pending demand of connecting Patna directly with Tirupati, Thiruvananthapuram and Kanyakumari by new trains.         
	On allegations by the Opposition of other states that he had made the railways Bihar centric, the railway minister said: Bihar and Jharkhand have been neglected for decades with regard to railway facilities. I am simply giving Bihar its due.

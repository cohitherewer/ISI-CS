          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 23: After leak furore, language dilemma.        
	Home minister P. Chidambaram has a problem on his hands  who will translate the Liberhan commission report into Hindi and not compromise secrecy.        
	Under Parliament rules, the report has to be tabled in both Hindi and English. But if Chidambaram  who today said there was only one copy of the report and it was in safe custody  wants to do it in this session itself, several hundred pages have to be translated from English to Hindi by December 22.        
	The report is a voluminous report and the action taken report has to be prepared. That takes time, especially when you are working in utmost secrecy, with just one officer looking at it, he told the Rajya Sabha today.        
	Six months after Justice Manmohan Singh Liberhan submitted his report, the government has not yet begun translating it. I have still not found a way in which 17 volumes or so can be translated without others coming to know of it, Chidambaram said. We are still working on it and I am confident that I will find a way.        
	One possible way out is for Chidambaram to put one of his own departments on the job  the department of official languages that also has a central translation bureau.        
	The bureau translates, free of cost, non-statutory procedural literature such as codes, manuals, forms and training material of different ministries. Home ministry sources, however, said the job of translating the report had not yet been given to the department.        
	But home secretary G.K. Pillai said the report would be tabled, as Chidambaram had said, in Parliaments winter session itself.

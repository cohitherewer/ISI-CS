The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nuanced central approach to Maoists
                                                                                                               Nuanced central approach to Maoists
          SUJAN DUTTA                            Manmohan Singh in Delhi on Tuesday; Chidambaram (PTI)                          
	New Delhi, Oct. 20: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is today understood to have called for a more calibrated strategy in the offensive against the Maoists, and the Centre indicated that it was seeking to distinguish its security-centric approach to insurgents who demanded secession and those (like the Maoists) who did not.        
	The Centre has re-emphasised that it was open to dialogue with the Maoists if they surrender arms.        
	As far as I can see, the only hurdle to holding talks with the CPI (Maoist) is the violence that stalks the areas in which they operate. I may draw your attention to the recent statements made by their leaders, especially Shri Muppala Laxman Rao (Ganapathy) and Shri Mallojula Koteshwar Rao (Kishenji), justifying violence and armed struggle, Union home minister P. Chidambaram, the architect of the offensive against the Maoists, has written to former Lok Saba Speaker Rabi Ray.        
	Ganapathy is the general secretary of the CPI (Maoist) and Kishenji a member of its politburo.        
	Repeating his belief that the Maoists are the gravest threat to internal security, the Prime Minister is understood to have told a combined commanders conference of the armed forces in which top cabinet ministers were also present that the government should nuance its strategy against the Maoists.        
	A senior officer who was present at the conference  that was closed to the media  read from his notes and said the Prime Minister called for a holistic approach with an agenda for inclusive growth. The official release of the excerpts of the Prime Ministers speech does not contain these words.        
	The call for a holistic approach contrasts with the home ministrys repeated assertions over the past few weeks that a development agenda in Maoist-influenced areas cannot be pursued till the zones were cleared of the militants. Last week, Rahul Gandhi said Maoism thrived in areas where government could not deliver.        
	Chidambaram, who also addressed the conference, said the government believed that the Maoists should be treated differently because unlike other insurgencies, they are not demanding secession, said the officer.        
	Chidambaram said it should be possible for the Maoists to join the mainstream political process if they gave up arms  a statement he has made in the past but emphasised today at the security meeting.        
	Chidambaram followed up this line by releasing a copy of a letter to the former Lok Sabha Speaker in which he wrote: The Government of India believes that all political parties and all shades of political opinion can find space and opportunity to work in a democratic system to advance the causes that are dear to them. The CPI (Maoist) can be no exception. It is in this view that we have declared that the CPI (Maoist) should abjure violence and talk to the governments concerned  both at the Central and at the State levels  on any issue that affects the people.        
	Chidambaram wrote to Ray because the former MP from Orissa was one of the signatories in an appeal from an outfit named the Citizens Initiative for Peace that feared that the real issues  of food, shelter and forest rights  would get obscured in the face of a military offensive by the Centre against the Maoists.        
	In a separate statement, the Union home ministry claimed it has information that Maoists in South Chhattisgarh have been forcibly recruiting children. The above information reveals the real face of Naxalites, who not only kill children but also put them in great danger by recruiting them in their armed squads to carry out their violent activities, a statement said.

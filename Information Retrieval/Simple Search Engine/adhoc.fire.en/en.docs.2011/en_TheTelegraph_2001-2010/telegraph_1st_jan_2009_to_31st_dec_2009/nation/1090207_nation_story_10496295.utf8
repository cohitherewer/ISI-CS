	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 6: A tribal family hailing from Sukinda in Jajpur was arrested today while attempting self-immolation in front of Naveen Nivas, the chief ministers residence, protesting against the administrations failure to trace their missing son.         
	The members were booked under Sections 309 and 34 of the IPC and were produced before the SDJM court, Bhubaneswar, said inspector in charge of Airfield police station Sangram Mishra. Naveen Patnaik was not at home and had left for Balasore at the time of the mishap.         
	The family alleged that their son, Bholeswar, had gone missing from the residence of senior BJD leader and finance minister Prafulla Ghadei, also the local MLA.         
	Haladhar Mahanta, 53, a resident of Nator (Baghua Sahi) village under Tamka police station area of Jajpur, said his son, Bholeswar, was taken to Ghadeis home on February 6, 2005, by Samrat Gupta, a trade union leader, to work as the domestic help. However, when the father went to visit Bholeswar he was informed that his son had left for his village with Samrat Gupta. Three years have passed since then and Bholeswar has not come home, he said.         
	Mahanta alleged that despite complaints, Bholeswar is yet to be traced.         
	No action is being taken by the police as a minister is involved, he said.         
	We are being threatened by the ministers goons and are being harassed by the police in the name of interrogation, the family head. Family members included Kamala Mahanta, Mila Mahanta, Basani Mahanta and Suresh Mahanta  who were all a part of the suicide bid.        
	Meanwhile, minister, Ghadei dismissed the allegation as baseless and politically motivated.

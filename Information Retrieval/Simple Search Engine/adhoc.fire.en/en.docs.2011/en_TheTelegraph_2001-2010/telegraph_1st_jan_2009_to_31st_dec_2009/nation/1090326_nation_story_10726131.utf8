	 Thiruvananthapuram: A manager who claims his vote was rigged twice plans not to turn up at the booth this time and show his ballot could still be cast.          
	K. Haridasan, who says he couldnt cast his vote in the Lok Sabha elections of 2004 and the Assembly polls of 2006, plans to deposit his voter ID card with the collector, hoping to expose the possible bogus voting in his absence.          
	The resident of Kannur, whose home falls under the Kasargod constituency, was turned away from booths on both occasions after being told that his vote had already been cast.          
	Now, Haridasan is doing all he can to uncover the possible fraud in the elections on April 16. Sitting MP, the CPMs P. Karunakaran, is pitted against his main rival, the Congresss Shahida Kamal, in the constituency.          
	Whats the meaning of democracy if I cant vote for the candidate of my choice? Entrusting my ID card to the collector, also the returning officer, will prove I didnt cast my vote. If the vote has still been cast, the onus is on the authorities. I will be deprived of my choice. But theres no other way I can redeem it, said Haridasan.          In 2004, he arrived at the booth around 11am on polling day, only to be told his vote had been cast. He protested, flashed his ID card and his left index finger that didnt not have the deep blue indelible ink mark to prove he hadnt voted. But the poll officer pleaded helplessness, saying K. Haridasan had cast his ballot as per our records.          The next time, in the 2006 Assembly elections, Haridasan reached the booth before 8am, hoping to beat the fake voter. When his turn came half an hour later, the officer found someone had voted on Haridasans behalf.          
	But this time, he didnt just walk away and cast a challenge vote. Such votes are counted and become crucial if the race between the main candidates is very tight.          
	Haridasan claims there is little resistance from booth agents of non-Left parties and poll officials, who helplessly watch voters return disappointed at being short-changed. The reason, he says, is fear of reprisals from CPM cadres.          
	The vote rogues have found a way to get around the indelible ink. Parties, Haridasan said, get small bottles of a white liquid that can wipe out the deep blue mark on the finger. Once erased, a person is ready for the next vote, given the chances of voter ID cards going unchecked.

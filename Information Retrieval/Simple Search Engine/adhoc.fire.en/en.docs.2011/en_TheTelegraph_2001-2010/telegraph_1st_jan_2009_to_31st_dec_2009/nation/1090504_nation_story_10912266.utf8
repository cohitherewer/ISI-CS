The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rahul roots for Singh 
                                                                                                               Rahul roots for Singh 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              Rahul (top), Singh: Mutual admiration				                                 
	New Delhi, May 3: Rahul Gandhi has said there can be no compromise over Manmohan Singh as Prime Minister after the general elections, which the young leader termed more complicated than the last one.        
	Rahuls comments came a day after Singh indicated willingness to hand over power to the younger Congress leadership.        
	Speaking to a TV channel, the AICC general secretary asserted that there was complete unanimity in the Congress over the choice for Prime Minister just as in the case of the Indo-US nuclear deal.         
	From my side, I know  and I do know my mothers views on this  that he is the best prime ministerial candidate. He is our candidate and we are going to stick by him. Like we did in the case of the nuclear deal, Rahul said.        
	Yesterday, Singh had said Rahul had all the qualities a good Prime Minister should have.        
	I certainly, at some stage, would like the seat of power should be in the hands of people younger than I am, the Prime Minister had said yesterday.        
	Today, Rahul expressed the hope that the Congress would perform better in the ongoing general elections. We will improve our tally. We will win and form the government. The 2004 elections hinged on two or three factors. This election is more complicated. I know where we are gaining: Kerala, Orissa, Punjab, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh etc.        
	Rahul, however, added that he would prefer to take a long-term view. A very deep issue that is not immediately visible is the issue of inclusion. What is the aam aadmi idea? It is inclusion and growth which are deeply connected. In fact, the country can grow faster only by taking everyone along.        
	Our aim has been  and this has been conveyed by the PM and the Congress president  to try and make sure that our government does this. For instance, take the Rozgar Yojana. The BJP ridiculed it at first. Yet the NREGA (the rural job scheme) has ensured enforcement of minimum wages across the country, he said.        
	Asked to comment on the Lefts sense of betrayal by the Congress over the nuclear deal, Rahul said: I dont think the Left feels a sense of betrayal. They have their point of view and we have ours. We are clear that we are not going to compromise on what we think is the right direction for the country and for the Congress.        
	Rahul stressed further on inclusion. We simply dont believe we can take this country forward without inclusion. What we are talking about is a core idea  that everybody should be part of the game. The BJP believes that the poor, the Dalits and the minorities should not be part of the game.

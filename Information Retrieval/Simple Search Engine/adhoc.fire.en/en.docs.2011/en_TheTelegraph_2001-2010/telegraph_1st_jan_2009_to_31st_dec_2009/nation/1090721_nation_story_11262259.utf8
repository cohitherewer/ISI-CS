The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BMW jail term cut by 3 years
                                                                                                               BMW jail term cut by 3 years
                            
	New Delhi, July 20 (Agencies): Delhi High Court today reduced the sentence of Sanjeev Nanda in the BMW hit-and-run case from five years to two.        
	Nanda, who had mowed down six persons, including three policemen, 10 years ago with his BMW, may walk free in around five months.        
	The 31-year-old grandson of former navy chief S.M. Nanda has already served nine months after his arrest in 1999 and 10 months after his conviction last year.        
	Justice Kailash Gambhir convicted Nanda under Section 304A of the IPC that relates to causing death by a rash and negligent act. This section carries a maximum punishment of two years.        
	He set aside the trial courts conviction under the provision of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. That carried a jail term of up to 10 years.        
	Nandas father, arms dealer Suresh Nanda, hailed the judgment, saying justice has been done with my son. But Delhi police, which probed the January 10, 1999, incident in the Lodhi Colony area, said they would appeal.        
	The court also reduced by half the sentences given to three others  businessmen Rajeev Gupta and his two employees Bhola Nath and Shyam Singh. They had been punished for destruction of evidence.        
	Gupta was sentenced to six months, down from one year awarded by the trial court. His employees will serve three months instead of six months.        
	The judge came down heavily on eyewitness Sunil Kulkarni for giving false testimony and ordered the courts registrar-general to initiate criminal proceedings.        
	Gambhir dubbed the Mumbai-based Kulkarni the most dishonest, unreliable, untrustworthy and untruthful witness.         
	His entry in the case is as dramatic as could happen only in our Bollywood movies. The deposition of court witness (Kulkarni) is thrown out lock, stock and barrel, the judge added.        
	Kulkarni had not only resiled from his testimonies but also carried out a sting operation leading to the conviction of two senior criminal lawyers, R.K. Anand and I.U. Khan, for contempt.        
	In his 274-page judgment, Gambhir said the more he read Kulkarnis statements, the more dishonesty, falsehood and crookedness of this man flows out.        
	Ram Jethmalani, Nandas lawyer, said he accepts this judgment with grace. However, the court declined to accept Jethmalanis plea that it should specify the sentence Nanda had already undergone.         
	There is no need to mention it. After a few months the convict would be out, Gambhir said.        
	The court took into account Nandas conduct, such as running away immediately after the accident and influencing witnesses during the trial, but the agony and trauma that he had undergone in the last 10 years appeared to have weighed heavily in his favour.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Sambalpur, May 14: Villagers of Badadhara, in Jharsuguda district under Lakhanpur Tehsil, are a worried lot. For, a mysterious fire has made many houses burst into flames this week.        
	The house of Bangali Pradhan burst into flames on Sunday night. We put it out. On Monday, the same thing took place thrice. The houses of Bhagaban Pradhan, Ratha Pradhan, Jena Bagarti and three others caught fire, a villager said.        
	While the villagers have resorted to prayers to rid themselves of this danger, the Jharsuguda superintendent of police A.K. Sarangi said there was nothing miraculous.         
	Red stones available in plenty in the area get heated due to the scorching heat and burst into flames. The temperature is around 45C in the area.        
	Our police staff advise villagers to keep houses, particularly cowsheds, wet, so that the red stones do not catch fire when they come in contact with cow dung or straw, Sarangi said.

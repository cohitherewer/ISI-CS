                                                                                                               US Andhra curse, again
                            
	Washington, Jan. 22 (PTI): A software engineer from Andhra Pradesh has been found dead in his apartment in Indianapolis, taking the number of students and professionals from the state who have lost their lives in the US in the last 14 months to eight.        
	Preliminary investigations into the death of Muthyala Purushottam, 27, pointed to suicide, police said.        
	Purushottam was found dead in a south-eastern neighbourhood of Indianapolis city on Tuesday evening. A resident of Anantapur in Andhra Pradesh, he worked with Triton Infotech.        
	Purushottam, son of police sub-inspector M. Nagalingam, moved to the US two years ago and was living with his wife Praveena, also a techie.         
	She was the one who first found his body, the police said. She alerted neighbours who then called the police.        
	An Indianapolis officer said the police received an emergency call around 6.15pm on Tuesday, saying Purushottam was lying dead on the floor.        
	The police found the victim on the floor when they landed but spotted some marks around his neck. He was immediately taken to hospital.        
	The police said the autopsy report had yet to come and nothing could be confirmed about the cause of death.        
	Purushottam is the eight Indian from Andhra who has died in the US over the past year or so. On January 13, Akshay Vishal, a techie working with Satyam Computer Services, was shot dead in Arkansas.        
	In November, Arpana B. Jenega, an IT engineer in Seattle, was found dead under mysterious circumstances in her apartment. In September, T. Soumya Reddy, an engineering student in Southern Illinois University, was murdered.         
	Her cousin Vikram Reddy, also a techie in Chicago, was found dead nearby.        
	A. Srinivas, a post-graduate medical student, was found murdered in Pennsylvania in March while A. Kirankumar and K. Chandrasekhar Reddy, both PhD students, were shot dead at Louisiana University in December 2007.

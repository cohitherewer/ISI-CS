The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Solution to Naxalism
                                                                                                               Solution to Naxalism
                                          
	Rahul Gandhi blamed poor governance in remote areas for the spread of the Naxalite movement, but remained quiet on who was to be blamed.        
	The movement has grown in the pockets where the government failed to reach to the people, Rahul said in Raipur on Friday.         
	He, however, skipped the question when asked who was to be held responsible as the Congress ruled the country for long.         
	Rather, he criticised the BJP government in Chhattisgarh for not taking effective measures to tackle the Maoist problem.        
	Andhra Pradesh government records say that it has effectively implemented central schemes that helped beneficiaries in remote areas, Gandhi said, adding that other state governments should replicate this model to wipe out Maoists.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Different don wins hearts
                                                                                                               Different don wins hearts
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Purnea (Bihar), April 26: It is peoples support for Rajesh Ranjan, alias Pappu Yadav, that separates the don from others of his ilk in Bihar.        
	He has his clout, infrastructure and visibly mad brand of supporters behind him, despite the fact that he has been a permanent resident of Tihar  1,400km from Purnea  for as many as eight years.        
	Thousands escorted the 110kg gangster-turned-campaigner, his mother Shanti Priya, and wife Ranjita Ranjan, while they visited every home, calling out with a line: Ai chacha, chachi, aur bhaiya, aapka beta apke pas aya hai. Rishte ko kayam rakhen.        
	The 43C temperature on the Purnea-Kasba road and the harsh wind, has failed to deter the campaigner, who has emerged as the new poster boy of Congress in his stronghold comprising Purnea, Madhepura and Supaul on the India-Nepal border.        
	What surprises visitors is how strongly Pappu, who stands convicted in the murder case of CPM MLA Ajit Sarkar and who has been incarcerated for eight years, has maintained his links with the masses.         
	Barred by the court from entering the fray, Pappu has fielded his mother, Shanti Priya, 65, as the Congress-backed Independent nominee from Purnea and his wife Ranjita Ranjan as Congress nominee from Supaul.        
	People were not as happy with Md Shahabuddin, the Siwan don, who has fielded his wife Heena Sahab from Siwan, some 400km from Purnea. Siwan voters felt that they would be truly liberated when Heena is defeated.        
	A tour in Purnea proves beyond that it is not Lalu Prasad, but Pappu who has the backing of Purnea Yadavs and Muslims. Pappu has proved his might on this seat time and again as no other politician has won the Lok Sabha polls thrice as an Independent other than him in Bihar.        
	The don won from Singheshwar Assembly seat in 1990 and debuted in the parliamentary arena. He won from Purnea seat, again as an Independent in 1994 by-election and repeated his victory from the same seat as an Independent in 1996 and 1999 before joining Lalu Prasads RJD and winning Madhepura seat as an RJD nominee in 2004.        
	Afdul Ghafar, a resident of Satbheria village in Purnea said: He (Pappu Yadav) is the real Robin Hood. Right from the start, Pappu battled the powerful Rajputs in feudal Purnea and liberated many poor Muslims and Yadavs from Rajput moneylenders.        
	Despite being a convict, the politician has maintained his image among his constituents, which is giving a sleepless night to BJP nominee Udai Singh, incidentally also known as Pappu Singh.               
	Ranjita is a favourite of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi. She will win on her own in Supaul as she has done a lot for victims, Pappu Yadav told The Telegraph with an air of confidence.        
	Unlike many other Bihar constituencies there is a straight contest in Purnea and Supaul. While Shanti Priya is locked in a battle with BJPs Udai Singh, LJPs Shankar Jha and CPMs Madhavi Sarkar, the widow of late Ajit Sarkar, seem to have no consequence.         
	Ranjita Ranjan is in direct contest with JD(U)s Vishwamohan Kumar in Supaul  where incidentally no voter could remember the names of other candidates.

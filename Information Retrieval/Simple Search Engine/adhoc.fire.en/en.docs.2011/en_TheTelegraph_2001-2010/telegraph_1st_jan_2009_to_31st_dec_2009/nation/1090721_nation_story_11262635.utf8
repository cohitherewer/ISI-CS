The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Voice for women, inspired by Silence

          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, July 20: A 14-year-old poem by economics student Anusuya Sengupta remains an abiding reminder to Hillary Clinton of tasks unfinished for womens emancipation, the US secretary of state said today.        
	Squeezing in an hour between her diplomatic engagements, Clinton visited the British-era Vice Regal lodge at Delhi University (DU) to address select students and faculty.        
	The theme of her address was Shaping the 21st Century  The US and India. And women, Clinton emphasised, must play a lead role in shaping the worlds future.        
	Too many women in too many countries speak the same language of silence, Clinton read out from Senguptas poem, titled Silence.        
	A 21-year-old student at DUs Lady Sri Ram College at the time, Sengupta had written the poem for Clinton when she visited as First Lady with her husband Bill Clinton in 1995.        
	A womens rights activist who works with Unicef and several NGOs, Sengupta today sat in the audience as Clinton read out excerpts from the poem. Clinton has earlier, too, revealed the impression Senguptas poem left on her, referring to it in a chapter titled Silence is Not Spoken Here in her best-selling autobiography published in 2003.        
	Today, the poem, which Clinton referred to as her inspiration, formed the launching pad for a passionately delivered  though predictable  speech on womens rights and the role of the youth in the 21st century.        
	No country can achieve its full potential if it neglects womens empowerment. In the 21st century, womens rights are as important as any other issue, Clinton said.        
	Former DU students union president Ragini Nayak asked Clinton whether she felt her gender was in any way responsible for her failure in reaching the Oval Office  and then apologised for the sensitive question.         
	No problems. You can ask me that, Clinton candidly said to peals of laughter. There are remnants of problems (in the US), she admitted, but added that she felt fortunate to be secretary of state.         
	Clinton pitched for greater cultural exchanges not just between India and the US, but also between India and Pakistan, to help reduce tensions between the neighbours.        
	I am a great believer in talking, she said, pointing towards students from Pakistan who were attending as volunteers with Seeds of Peace, an American NGO supported by the US state department. These students, Clinton said, could act as agents of change between the two countries that have traditionally stood eyeball to eyeball.         
	If we were to base our idea of India through Bollywood, we would conclude that everyone here is beautiful, has dramatic lives with a happy ending. And if you were to view us through Hollywood, you may think we dont wear any clothes and keep fighting, Clinton joked.        
	She argued that diplomacy could no longer remain the preserve of governments. President Obama and I believe in citizen diplomacy, Clinton said, arguing that citizens, especially youths, could play key roles in challenging the status quo.         
	She cited the example of Iran, where several youths have used technology to defy a government-imposed ban on protests against controversial election results.        
	But not all students found Clintons address riveting. Sumit Chokhani, an MBA student at DUs Faculty of Management Studies, said he found the speech predictable. It was along expected lines. Nothing specifically interesting. I would have liked to ask her about expanding the H1-B visa regime, he said.

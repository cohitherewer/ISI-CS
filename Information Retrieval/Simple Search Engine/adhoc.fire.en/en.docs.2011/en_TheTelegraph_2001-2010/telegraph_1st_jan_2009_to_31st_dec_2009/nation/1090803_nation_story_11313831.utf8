                                                                                                               Nitish flood survey
                              Kosi floods of 2008                            
	Sitamarhi (Bihar), Aug. 2 (PTI): Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar today carried out an aerial survey of flood-hit areas near Tilak-Tajpur in Sitamarhi district where the swollen Bagmati breached its embankment affecting about one lakh people.        
	Nitish also held a review meeting with chief secretary, principal secretary of disaster management, road construction department secretary and district magistrate to assess the situation after yesterdays breach.        
	Stating that a team would probe into the reasons behind the breach, Nitish said that the culprits would not be spared and stern action would follow.        
	To provide succour to the affected people, the chief minister said that the state would set up camps in the flood-hit areas and also provide relief to those marooned and those who do not wish to travel to the relief camps.        
	A committee comprising all parties would be formed at panchayat levels which would prepare the list of victims for the purpose of providing relief to them, he said.         
	Meanwhile, officers of irrigation department have begun work to plug the breach at Tilak-Tajpur. The chief minister said senior police officers have been directed to camp at the site to oversee the work.         
	Nitish said that the government would distribute one quintal of foodgrain and cash among victims on the line of 2007 floods. A team of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has been pressed into service, along with rescue boats.         
	Expressing hope that the state would quickly control the situation, Nitish said there was a need to keep a vigil on Bihars north as rains in Nepal had raised the water level of local rivers.        
	The CPI-ML(Liberation) today demanded the resignation of Bihar water resources development minister for not taking measures to prevent the breach in the Bagmati which caused floods in Sitamarhi.        
	The government did not learn lessons from last years Kosi floods and it is continuing with the water resources minister, Vijendra Yadav, who failed to tackle the floods. Yadav should be immediately dismissed, said a CPI-ML (Liberation) release.        
	The release added that Yadav had not measures to keep the Bagmati embankment near Tilak-Tajpur in Sitamarhi district, intact. The swollen Bagmati yesterday breached its embankment and caused floods in the area.        
	Holding the government responsible for the breach, the CPI-ML said the floods happened due to the use of cheap quality material in construction work.

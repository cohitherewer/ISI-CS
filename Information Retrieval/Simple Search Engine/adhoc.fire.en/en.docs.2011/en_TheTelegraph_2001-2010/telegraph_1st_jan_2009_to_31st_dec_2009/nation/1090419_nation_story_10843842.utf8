	April 18: A Babri barb from ally Lalu.        
	Lalu Prasad yesterday said the Congress, too, was responsible for the Babri Masjids demolition as it did nothing to save the mosque, but the target of his attack refused to get into a confrontation for fear of exacerbating tensions.        
	The Babri Masjid was razed to the ground and the Congress too is responsible for it as it did nothing to prevent it (from being pulled down), the RJD chief told an election meeting in Darbhanga, Bihar.        
	If anyone continues to talk nonsense, I will reveal more, he had added without elaborating.        
	Asked by reporters later about his speech, Lalu Prasad repeated what he had said. Yes indeed, the Congress could not save the mosque from being brought down, but (L.K.) Advani was the alamdar (leader) of the incident.        
	Today, Kapil Sibal, a spokesperson for the Congress, which ruled the Centre when the mosque was stormed in 1992, said the railway minister had never mentioned the charge in Parliament during the five years the UPA was in power.        
	Every year, on December 6 (the day the mosque was demolished), there is a debate in Parliament but not once did Laluji even suggest that the Congress was responsible for it. Lately, he is seen with (former BJP leader) Kalyan Singh. But he (Lalu Prasad) is still our ally.        
	Congress sources said they didnt want to join issue with Lalu Prasad and exacerbate tensions with the fourth front, which includes the RJD, the Samajwadi Party and the LJP.        
	No point antagonising small parties too much as the Congress might need all the support it can garner after the election results come out, a source said.        
	Lalu Prasads one-time-comrade-turned-foe Nitish Kumar, however, seized on the RJD leaders comment. The Bihar chief minister said Lalu Prasad should bare all facts about the demolition before the country.        
	Why is he only threatening to disclose the secret? the Janata Dal (United) leader asked.        
	The BJP said Lalu Prasad was still a member of Manmohan Singhs cabinet and dared the Prime Minister to sack him.        
	Lalu Prasad, recently chastised by the Election Commission for his crush-under-the-roller remark against Varun Gandhi, also took a dig at the BJP saying the letters stood for Bharat Jalao Party.        
	It wants to see India up in flames, he said.

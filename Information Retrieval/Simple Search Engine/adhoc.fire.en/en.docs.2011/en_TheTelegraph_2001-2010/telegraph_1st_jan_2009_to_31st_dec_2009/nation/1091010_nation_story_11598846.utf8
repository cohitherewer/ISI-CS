	New Delhi, Oct. 9: The toll in yesterdays encounter in Gadchiroli district in Maharashtra might have been lower had the police party that was ambushed followed the manual for patrolling in Maoist zones, an analysis of the incident available with the Union home ministry has concluded.        
	At least 18 commandos of the Maharashtra polices specially raised C-60 unit were killed by an estimated 200 Maoists. The police party of about 45 was patrolling the area on foot. The assessment with the home ministry suggests that the commandos may not have been spaced out but were almost huddled as they marched. There was an exchange of fire for about three hours.        
	There is a drill for such duties (as patrolling in Maoist zones). It is expected that a patrol will be stretched out over a considerable area while marching on foot and each trooper is expected to keep the other in sight, a senior home ministry official said today.        
	Asked for his perception on why Maoist attacks have mounted, a senior home ministry official said: They are showing their might. They may also be trying to move some of their leaders to safer places.        
	He said the police in four states ----- Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Orissa and Jharkhand ---- where a stepped-up offensive is in the works for six districts, were now expanding. It was expected that in about two years, police stations with just about six or seven personnel would have 40 to 80 personnel to dominate their areas of responsibility.        
	In yesterdays encounter in Gadhchiroli, two air force helicopters that were sent to evacuate casualties could not land at first because of poor light. The Centre has now moved companies of the BSF into the area.        
	Maoists have been known to be active in the district for more than 10 years. Maharashtra goes into the Assembly polls on October 13. Politicians have been advised not to travel to parts of the district.

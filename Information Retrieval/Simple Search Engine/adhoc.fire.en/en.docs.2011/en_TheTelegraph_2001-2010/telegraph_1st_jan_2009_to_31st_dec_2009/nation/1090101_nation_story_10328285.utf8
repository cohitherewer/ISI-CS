	Hyderabad, Dec. 31: A college girl injured in an acid attack earlier this month died today, over two weeks after police gunned down the three youths who had targeted her.        
	B. Swapnika, 23, was put on the ventilator on Friday. She died of multiple organ failure, doctors said.        
	The final-year engineering student of Warangals Kakatiya Institute of Technology, 140km from Hyderabad, had suffered 50 per cent burns in the December 10 attack. She was due to join Infosys after her course.         
	Swapnikas father Devender said she had had 15 surgeries, including skin grafts, and would have needed six more.        
	T. Pranita, Swapnikas friend who was with her when the attack took place, is recovering in a Hyderabad hospital. Srinivas Rao, one of the youths who attacked the girls, had claimed that Swapnika jilted him.        
	When the police shot the three youths  Srinivas, Sanjay and Harikrishna  within three days of the attack, several rights groups had raised charges of a fake encounter.         
	The police said the trio were killed after they turned on officers leading them to the spot in a forest where they had hidden their stocks of acid. The Telugu Desam and the CPM had demanded a probe.        
	Womens groups, however, said the police had dealt with the youths in an appropriate manner and justice was done. Today, Swapnikas death left them saddened.        
	Its sad that a budding engineer has died because of a jilted lovers lunatic act, said Padma, the president of the Progressive Organisation of Women.        
	Chief minister Y.S.R. Rajasekhara Reddy led a host of leaders in condoling the death. Several students and womens groups attended the funeral.

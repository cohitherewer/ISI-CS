                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      US restricts import of matches
                            
	New Delhi, Nov. 23 (PTI): The US will restrict imports of matches from India by imposing additional duties after it found such shipments were hurting local firms.        
	The department of commerce (of the US) will issue countervailing and anti-dumping duty orders on imports of these products (matches) from India, the US International Trade Commission (USITC) said in a release.        
	The decision to impose additional duties comes after a complaint filed by US-based D.D. Bean and Sons against exports from Mumbai-based Triveni Safety Matches.        
	The department of commerce has found the matches are subsidised and sold in the US at less than fair value. The final order will be issued around November 30.

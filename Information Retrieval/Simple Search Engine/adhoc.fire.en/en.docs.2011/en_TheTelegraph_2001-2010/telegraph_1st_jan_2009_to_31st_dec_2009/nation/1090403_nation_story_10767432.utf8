                                                                                                               Who-to-vote-for manual for Muslims
          CITHARA PAUL                                            
	New Delhi, April 2: A conglomeration of major Muslim organisations has issued election guidelines advising the aam Musalman whom to vote for so the communitys votes are not wasted on losing candidates.        
	The advisory from the Joint Committee of Muslim Organisations for Empowerment will be read out across the country during Friday prayers.        
	According to the guidelines, Muslims at any constituency must vote for a common candidate  not necessarily a Muslim  who they believe is the most winnable secular candidate from a secular party.        
	Vote neither for weak candidates on the basis of personal relationship or past favours or fear of reprisal or physical violence, the guidelines advise, nor for small parties or mini-parties of recent origin, which are most likely to face defeat.        
	The committee  made up by the likes of the Jamaat-e- Islami, Milli Council and the Imam Sangh  has decided to form consultative bodies at the constituency level to unite and mobilise the Muslim electorate for the common cause.        
	It asks Muslim voters, particularly women and young people, to vote massively to increase the political weight of the community.        
	Where Muslims are less than 20 per cent, they should vote for the most winnable candidate of a secular party. (Where they are) up to 30 per cent, they should vote for the most winnable candidate of a secular party, preferably a Muslim, the guidelines say.        
	In Muslim-majority constituencies, they should vote for the most winnable Muslim candidate, who can even be an Independent.        
	But how does a Muslim voter decide which of the secular candidates in his or her constituency is the right one? The guidelines spell out several criteria that should help settle the matter:        
	The political record of the party and the candidate in areas of Muslim concern and distress        
	Relative winnability, and performance in 2004        
	Overall acceptability of the candidate        
	The proportion of Muslim candidates fielded by the party        
	If still confused, the voters should consult a cross-section of distinguished Muslims of the constituency who have knowledge, experience and political understanding and are not active in the ranks of any political party.        
	According to the joint committee, Muslims primary interest should be to raise their representation in the Lok Sabha by electing vocal and fearless MPs who would promote the communitys case for reservation.        
	The guidelines warn Muslims against voting under the influence of recent events or emotional issues but always take a long-term view on the overall progress of the community and the nation.        
	We decided to prepare (the) guidelines to enable Muslim organisations to help the electorate support the right candidates that will enable the formation of a secular government at the Centre, said Jamaluddin Fakir of the committee.        
	The guidelines ask minority voters to check their names on the voter list and report any distortion to the office concerned.

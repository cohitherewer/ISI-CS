	New Delhi, May 26: None of the six ministers of state posts for the Trinamul Congress will come with independent charge, sources said today.        
	The six Mamata Banerjee has picked are Dinesh Trivedi, Sisir Adhikary, C.M. Jatua, Saugata Roy, Sultan Ahmed and Mukul Roy, the sources said.         
	Mukul is a Rajya Sabha member and the rest are from the Lok Sabha.         
	Some of the hopefuls are believed to have expressed hopes for independent charge of a ministry, but Mamata, it is learnt, did not press the Congress too hard.

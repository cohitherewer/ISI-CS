          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Sept. 7: A prisoner was killed and a constable wounded today in a bomb blast and police firing on Munger civil court premises in south-eastern Bihar, 200km from Patna.        
	Three prisoners, Amit Mandal, Rupesh Yadav and Deni, all undertrial prisoners, tried to escape from their prison van on their way back to jail after a court appearance. Deni was killed in the police firing that begun after the blast.        
	Additional director-general (ADG) of headquarters Neelmani said that some men handed over a tiffin box containing the explosives to one of the three, while they were getting in the van.         
	One of the prisoners exploded the bomb. Security forces responded by firing. Deni was killed in the firing, while Amit was caught. Rupesh managed to escape, said Neelmani. A constable also sustained injury in the explosion. The incident which took place around noon, created panic in the court, leading to judges, advocates and court staff to flee.         
	Munger district magistrate Arbind Kumar, however, said that sufficient forces had been deployed around the court and the situation was normal now.         
	Efforts were underway to nab the culprits, Neelmani said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bofors ghost to be buried
                                                                                                               Bofors ghost to be buried
          PTI AMP; OUR BUREAU                          Quattrocchi                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 29: The phantom of Bofors looks set for a legal burial with the government informing the Supreme Court today that it had decided to withdraw the case against Italian businessman Ottavio Quattrocchi.        
	Solicitor-general Gopal Subramanium told a bench headed by the Chief Justice that all efforts had failed to extradite Quattrocchi, an accused in the two-decade-old case relating to alleged payment of Rs 64 crore as commission in the Swedish Howitzer deal.        
	He said the CBI had decided to close the case by also taking into account a Delhi High Court judgment that held no case of corruption could be made out in the Bofors deal.         
	Subramanium said the government came to the decision after taking into account all the facts of the case.        
	The solicitor-generals statement in the court came under immediate attack from the BJP and the lawyer who is pursuing the Bofors case in the Supreme Court.        
	The Congress said the phantom of Bofors stood no legal scrutiny despite being repeatedly raised by the Opposition. It is a good step, though taken rather late. The Opposition has been bringing out the phantom of Bofors from the cupboard and slaying it again and again for the past 23 years, Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari said.         
	He said whenever the issue went to any court in India or abroad, it could not withstand legal scrutiny. Its time that the era of character assassination is brought to an end, he said.        
	The BJP said the Congress government was bailing Quattrocchi out as he knows too much. Citing earlier instances when the UPA government had allegedly helped the Italian businessman, BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said: The CBI was not allowed to file an appeal against the court order passed in 2005. In Argentina, an order was passed refusing extradition to Quattrocchi but no appeal was allowed to be filed again.        
	Quattrocchi has been treated by this government as a son-in-law of this country, said advocate Ajay Agrawal, who had moved the apex court in January 2006, against defreezing Quattrocchis bank account in London.        
	Quattrocchi, 69, is the sole accused in the case after Delhi High Court on May 31, 2005, quashed charges against the other accused. Quattrocchi has not appeared before Indian courts.        
	The solicitor-general, who objected to the description of Quattrocchi as son-in-law, said a call had to be taken for the closure of the case.        
	The CBI and the Centre took into consideration the February 4, 2004, verdict of the high court which held there was not a rubble of evidence under the Prevention of Corruption Act.

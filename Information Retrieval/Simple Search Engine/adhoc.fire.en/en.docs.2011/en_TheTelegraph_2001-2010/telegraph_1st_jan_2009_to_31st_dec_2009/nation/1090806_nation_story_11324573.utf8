The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rain relief for paddy
                                                                                                               Rain relief for paddy
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, Aug. 5: Farmers in the states rice bowl have heaved a sigh of relief with rain lashing the region today at a perfect time  when paddy seedlings were transplanted to fields.        
	According to our forecast, heavy rain has started across the state today. Large parts of northern and eastern Bihar and some parts of central Bihar should witness substantial rainfall in the next couple of days, said Met office director Animesh Chanda.        
	Chanda told The Telegraph: There is fear, as the southern districts, including Gaya and Aurangabad, have recorded deficit rainfall. But if the state gets 300mm of rainfall in August, it should be able to control the damage caused by the protracted dry spell to some extent.        
	Experts believe that if the farmers get enough water to get their paddy seedling transplanted to their fields even by August 15, the state will be able to achieve more than 75 per cent of the target of its kharif yield.        
	By and large the weather god was still on the negative side for agriculture in the state. From now on, the state needs at least 500mm of rains to sustain paddy crops, which need constant accumulation of water around its roots, Chanda said, fearing: In meteorological terms, weather is still 43 per cent on the negative side.        
	Buxar, Bhojpur and Kaimaur districts in central Bihar and Bhagalpur, East Champaran and West Champaran districts in eastern Bihar constitute what the experts describe as the rice bowl of the state.        
	Fortunately, the weather office predicts substantial rainfall in the days to follow in these districts which contribute around 50 per cent of the total rice production in the state. The states 30 out of 38 districts have been facing possibility of drought.        
	Except Purnea and Kishengaj districts, which have recorded expected rainfall, and some other north Bihar districts, which got flood waters because of breach in an embankment on the Bagmati in Sitamarhi district, almost all other districts have so far recorded 50 to 60 per cent less rainfall than normal one.        
	Chief minister Nitish Kumar has assigned his ministers to carry out a survey of the drought-hit districts and submit their reports.         
	He has also demanded the central government to send its team to assess the situation and sanction at least Rs 9,000 crore to deal with the drought condition.

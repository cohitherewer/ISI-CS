The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | EC pay-up punch to ad babus
                                                                                                               EC pay-up punch to ad babus
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                          The Commonwealth Games ad that incurred the poll panels wrath                                   
	New Delhi, March 7: The Election Commission has sent notices to the central and Delhi governments over a full-page advertisement carried in newspapers yesterday, alleging poll code violation.        
	The ad, published four days after the model code of conduct kicked in, described the 2010 Commonwealth Games as a promise for Indians that would boost Delhis infrastructure and create thousands of jobs. The ad did not name the advertiser.        
	This is a clear violation of the model code of conduct which prohibits publication of the achievements of the government at the cost of the public exchequer, the commission said in a communication to the two governments today.        
	The commission has asked that the money spent on these ads  estimated to be several crores  be recovered from the personal accounts of the officials responsible for their release and publication.        
	It has asked the two governments to hand in an action-taken report by Monday noon  a difficult task by all accounts.        
	Theres no precedent, though, of money being recovered from officials in such cases. Usually, the accused governments or parties are let off after promising not to publish the ads again.        
	The commission notice comes six days after the Centre rejected a request by the poll panel chief, N. Gopalaswami, to remove election commissioner Navin Chawla on the charge of pro-Congress bias.         
	Gopalaswami will retire on April 20, after overseeing the first phase of the elections, and Chawla will take over as chief election commissioner.         
	The notice asks the Union cabinet secretary, the secretary to the youth affairs and sports ministry, and the Delhi chief secretary to reveal who published the ads, which officers authorised their release and the expense incurred in publishing them.        
	The notice came on separate complaints lodged by BJP leaders Vijay Goel and Praveen Khandelwal.        
	The BJP lauded the commissions move and plans to milk the issue in its poll campaign. Spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad today accused the UPA government of continuing to seek publicity at the cost of the exchequer despite the model code having come into force.         
	He said the ad was all the more shocking since the preparations for the Games were in bad shape.        
	The ad said: 24 flyovers, 75 aerobridge airport, 1285 kms of better roads, 5000 low-floor buses, 80 new metro destinations, 11 world-class sports venues, 59 hectare games village, restoration of 46 national monuments and thousands of job opportunities FOR YOU. FOR DECADES.        
	BJP leader Goel criticised the government for issuing such misleading ads giving false promises of more jobs just to garner political mileage and more votes.

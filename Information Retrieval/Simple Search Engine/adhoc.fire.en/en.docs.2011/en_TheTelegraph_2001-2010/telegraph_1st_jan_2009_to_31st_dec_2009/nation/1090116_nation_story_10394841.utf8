                                                                                                               Forces march out of Kandhamal
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          CRPF jawans guard a church in Kandhamal                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 15: The pullout of central paramilitary forces from strife-torn Kandhamal began today.        
	Seven companies of the Central Reserve Police Force were withdrawn from the district today, deputy inspector-general of police (southern range) R.P. Koche said.        
	The rest of the paramilitary forces would be redeployed in sensitive pockets of the district, he said. While two companies of CRPF were withdrawn from Baliguda, one company each was pulled out from Mandasur, Pabingia, Katingia, Belghar and Siriguda, police sources said.        
	Kandhamal district collector Krishan Kumar said the pullout of central paramilitary force from the district would have no impact on the law and order situation, as it was being done in phases. Only seven out of 39 companies of CRPF deployed in the district are being withdrawn in the first phase, he said.        
	We are keeping close watch on the situation at the places from where forces are being withdrawn, he said.        
	More than 40 companies of central paramilitary force had been deployed in the district in the aftermath of the communal violence triggered by the murder of Swami Laxmananda Saraswati and four of his associates on August 23.         
	The communal violence had claimed 38 lives and left 134 injured. An estimated 1,071 houses were completely and 2,833 partially damaged in Kandhamal in the riots, which also caused destruction to several churches, prayer houses hospitals and schools.        
	More than 25,000 Christians had fled their home during the riots and took shelter in relief camps. At present, 6,000 to 7,000 people staying in seven relief camps.        
	As normalcy has been restored and no incident of violence has been reported from the region since October, the Union home ministry has decided to pull out the paramilitary force. It has been mutually decided by the Centre and the state government that 10 companies of CRPF and two companies of Rapid Action Force would be withdrawn from the state.        
	While seven companies of CRPF were pulled out from Kandhamal district, one company each was withdrawn from Ganjam and Sundargarh districts. Besides, two companies of RAF are being pulled out from Balasore and one more from neighbouring Bhadrak district, said a senior home department official.

	Patna, Feb. 4: A police inspector died of a cardiac arrest after he failed to control a violent mob locked in a battle in north Bihars Gopalganj district, 150km from here today.         
	Members of two communities clashed over the procession of goddess Saraswati passing through Bishunpur Bazaar under Sidhwalia police station area at 2pm. Police sources said that members of a particular community objected to the procession going through a non prescribed route at Palar Tola.         
	Frenzied members of the two groups soon began pelting stones on each other and the police force, led by inspector Jaiprakash Paswan (48).         
	Gopalganj superintendent of police, who soon reached the spot with additional forces, said: The inspector belonging to Sadar police station suffered a massive heart attack on the spot. He died on the way to Gopalganj government hospital.         
	The Gopalganj superintendent of police, too, suffered minor injuries from stones and boulders thrown at him from the crowd. Deputy inspector-general, Saran, Jaglal Choudhary reached the spot with around 300 officers by 6pm. The situation is tense but fully under control now, the SP said. The security forces have cordoned off the area from all sides.

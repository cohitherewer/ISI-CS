          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Feb. 20: A man tried to set himself on fire today, while attending the janata durbar at a remote village in Sheikhpura district, 150km from here.        
	Security guards and residents intervened, rescuing Dharmraj Prasad, 30, who had failed to land a teachers job. Dharmraj survived with 25 per cent burns.        
	The incident took place at Pharpur village under Ariari block of Sheikhpura.        
	Taking to the media, Dharmraj said that he qualified as a teacher in 2006.         
	But, the authorities apparently concerned cancelled his appointment on the ground that he had produced a fake certificate, whereas he claimed his certificate to be genuine.        
	Dharmraj claimed that he appeared thrice in Nitish Kumars janata durbar at Patna to pursue his claim and also paid Rs 50,000, as bribe to the district magistrate. Finally, when everything failed he decided to end his life. Nitish Kumar today ordered a probe into Dharmrajs case.

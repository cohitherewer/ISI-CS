  - Maoists launch midnight attack on Orissa hydel station          OUR BUREAU                                    
	Gaya/Bhubaneswar, Dec. 20: Maoists today killed a college employee abducted on Friday in Gaya and set parts of a hydel power station on fire in Orissas Malkangiri last night, disrupting supply across the coastal state.        
	The bullet-riddled body of Kamlesh Kumar, a Grade IV employee of Upendra Nath Verma College, was recovered from a field near Neota village under Imamganj police station area this morning. The college employee was abducted late on Friday evening by a group of Maoists.        
	Confirming the murder, Gaya police chief Sushil Khopade said a hand-written note was also found near the body. In the note, the Maoists, while claiming responsibility, said that Kamlesh had been killed for his association with the Tritiya Prastuti Committee, a splinter group of the Naxalite organisation. The Maoist note also warned others of a similar fate if they continued to side with traitors.        
	Angry villagers blocked the state highway linking Gaya with Imamganj and Dumaria to protest Kamleshs killing. The protesters also demanded Rs 10 lakh compensation and a government job for one of his family members.        
	The rebels claim Dumaria, Imamganj and Barachatti of Gaya as liberated zones.        
	In Orissa, power generation was severely hit after the rebels set fire to several parts of the unit run by the Orissa Hydro Power Corporation (OHPC) at Balimela on the Andhra Pradesh border.        
	The extremists swooped on the unit around midnight and overpowered securitymen and staff at the plant. They also tied six persons to a structure outside the powerhouse before ransacking a portion of the valve house situated on top of a hill.        
	This over, the ultras put up several posters and banners carrying messages against the government and police. They were about 20 in number. The Maoists first set fire to the installations, torched a couple of equipment and caused damage to a few machines, said district superintendent of police Satyabrata Bhoi.        
	The guerrillas also attacked the intake tunnel through which water flowed inside, crippling power generation at the unit, he said. He, however, refuted reports that the extremists had blown up the valve house.        
	No explosive was used to cause the damage, Bhoi said. The damage has brought power generation in the hydel unit to a grinding halt. The project, with a total capacity of 510MW, was generating about 360MW at present due to low water level.        
	A team of OHPC officials has left for Balimela to gauge the extent of damage. Additional security forces have also been rushed to the site and massive combing operation was immediately launched to track the Maoists, the police said.

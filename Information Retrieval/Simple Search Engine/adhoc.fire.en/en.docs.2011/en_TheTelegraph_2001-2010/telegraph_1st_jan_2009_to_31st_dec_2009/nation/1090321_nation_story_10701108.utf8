          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, March 20: Astrologer-tantrik Hasmukh Rathod may have victimised many other innocent women and minor girls, Vijay Parmar, the maternal uncle of the sisters abused by him, claimed today.        
	Parmar, along with his elder brother and sister, had helped expose the shocking incest case after his 21-year-old niece confided to him that her father and the tantrik had sexually exploited her for nine years.        
	The Parmars have known Rathod for over two decades. Parmars sister Anjana introduced the tantrik to her husband, Kishore Chauhan.        
	Parmar said: Rathod does not dress like a sanyasi, but used to be dressed impeccably. He claimed to be a numerologist also, and would use sexual relations as a solution to problems.        
	For example, he would tally your birth date and tell you that if you have sexual relations with a woman whose birth date totalled another specific number, it would resolve whatever problem you have.        
	Parmar said Mira Road police should investigate the case thoroughly. I am certain Rathod has abused more such women. My nieces have shown the courage to speak up despite knowing that it will tarnish the family name. Both the girls are badly affected by the trauma and are crying constantly.        
	He said the girls were now with their grandmother at his brothers house in Santa Cruz. The younger girl, who is 15, has board exams next month, but is unlikely to take them.        
	Police investigations showed the 21-year-old had contemplated suicide and confided her ordeal to a male friend. But fear of her father stopped her from going to the police. The girl lodged a police complaint only after she learnt her sister was being put through the same ordeal.         
	Citing how Chauhan was unpredictable when angry, Parmar said about 10 days ago he had destroyed a Samsung mobile phone gifted to him with a hammer because he did not like the model. A wristwatch presented to him at a family wedding met the same fate.        
	Chauhan, Anjana and Rathod will be produced before a Thane court tomorrow for extension of remand.

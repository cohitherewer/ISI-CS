The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | SC stays age bar on law courses 
                                                                                                               SC stays age bar on law courses 
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 31: The Supreme Court has stayed a Bar Council rule that set age limits on students of legal courses.         
	The council has set 20 years as the upper age limit for entrants to the five-year integrated LLB course and 30 years for enrolling in the three-year degree version.        
	The Bar Council of India, the apex regulatory body for legal education, had introduced the rule last September to check the declining standards of legal education by getting in younger people. The only concession was a five-year relaxation for reserved category students.        
	The rule has been challenged in at least 11 high courts on many grounds. Critics say keeping out those interested in studying the subject is not the way to reduce overcrowding. The rule will also restrict lateral entry of professionals from other fields, they say.         
	Many doctors, engineers, CAs and others take up the law courses later in life to deal with cases related to their areas of specialisation.        
	The age limit is arbitrary and unreasonable, the critics say. It is also against the principle of equality (Article 14 of the Constitution) and the right to pursue any trade, occupation or profession of choice under Article 19.        
	The council believes setting an age limit will improve the quality of lawyers and help deal with the challenges posed by liberalisation of the profession.         
	It had earlier tried to prevent those above 45 from enrolling as lawyers but courts spiked the rule.

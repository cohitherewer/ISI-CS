The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | POLITICAL RING 
                                                                                                               POLITICAL RING 
										      Pranab Mukherjee, replying to BJP taunts that Manmohan Singh is a ldquo;weak PM rdquo;, has said Prime Ministers need not be wrestlers. A look at PMs, wannabe PMs and other politicians who have been wrestlers         
	P.V. Narasimha Rao  
	The polyglot was a wrestler as well, entering competitions as a student of Law College, Nagpur.Yet he could not protect the Babri Masjid, nor himself from being openly humiliated by colleagues after the mosques demolition    
	Mulayam Singh Yadav        
	As a young man, he was wrestling champion of Etawah district, with a knack for the Charkha Daon move in which an        
	opponent is tossed in the air like a wheel. He attends the winter wrestling meet in his home village, Saifai, as chief guest every year. Mulayam is on record saying grapplers makegood politicians          
	Y.B. Chavan  
	A former wrestler is perhaps an obvious choice for defence minister. Or so Jawaharlal Nehru must have thought as he appointed Y.B. Chavan to the post    
	Raj Narain        
	As a college student in Varanasi, he participated in wrestling tournaments called Dangals, rather unusually for an uppercaste youth. In the political ring, he was a giant-killer, defeating Indira Gandhi        
	Sharad Pawar        
	Reports vary on whether Indias cricket boss was a wrestler but the Maharashtra strongman and would-be PM is a known wrestling enthusiast. In December 2007, his party NCP reportedly held a wrestling tournament in Pimpri-Chinchwad in Pawars constituency to celebrate his birthday          
	Manohar Aich  
	Bengals Pocket Hercules wasnt exactly a wrestler but comes close in the power stakes as a bodybuilder. He won the Mr Universe title but couldnt win Dum Dum in 1991on a BJP ticket    
	Arnold Schwarzenegger        
	As body builder politicians go, the most famous is Terminator himself. The Austrian-born Hollywood action hero  the youngest Mr Universe ever and seven-time Mr Olympia  went on to become Californias Republicangovernor          
	Dara Singh  
	The face of Indian wrestling became a BJP Rajya Sabha member but hardly attended the House or spoke    
	Jesse Ventura        
	The American professional wrestler, known as The Body, went on to become The Governing Body as governor of Minnesota (1999-2003)

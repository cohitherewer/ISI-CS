	Dumka, Oct. 11: Seven passengers of Uttar Pradesh-Howrah-New Delhi Janata Express sustained injuries when a 14-member gang attacked the SC-II coach between Jasidih and Lahavan stations on the Patna-Howrah main section of Eastern Railway and decamped with Rs 48,000 early today.         
	The train had no police escorts and the group of youths, aged between 16 and 25 years, went on a robbing spree threatening passengers with daggers and country-made pistols.        
	One Manahor Shaw, 45, a resident of Keshopur Jamalpur village under Munger (Bihar) district sustained serious injuries and was admitted to Jhajha primary health centre this morning. Afterwards, he was referred to Jamui Sadar hospital as his condition deteriorated.         
	Officer-in-charge of Jasidih railway station S.K. Sinha said that the group of 14 got on the train between Jhajha (Bihar) and Jasidih (Deoghar) stations around 2.50am.         
	Passengers said the youths boarded the train at Jasidih and began their operation as soon as the train picked up speed near Tulshitard halt, he said.         
	He added that the group robbed approximately Rs 48,000 from passengers, besides mobile phones, wristwatches, and jewellery. However, passengers claimed that more than Rs 1.5 lakh, besides valuables, were taken away during the attack.        
	A GRP officer on the condition of anonymity said there were no escorts because the zone was a rebel stronghold. Due to Naxalite threat, policemen avoid this section.

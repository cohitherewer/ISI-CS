	New Delhi, May 16: A calendar with Harkishen Singh Surjeets photograph hangs on the wall near the reception desk at AKG Bhavan. But any throwback to 2004, when the proponent of rapprochement with the Congress was alive, ends there.        
	With 24 MPs, the CPM can hardly hope to play a role in government formation unlike five years back when the 60-strong Left was a crucial prop for the Congress-led regime.        
	By noon, Prakash Karats statement had come in.        
	The CPM and the Left parties have suffered a major setback in these elections, the CPM general secretary said. This necessitates a serious examination of the reasons for the partys poor performance.        
	A short walk away, at a counting station for the New Delhi seat, Congress supporters celebrated Ajay Makans victory. The victory frenzy would soon spill on to the road in front of the CPM headquarters.         
	Karat, reading from a prepared statement, said the CPM would continue its co-operation with non-Congress, non-BJP secular parties with whom we have been working.         
	The CPM assures all those who have reposed faith in the party that we will continue to champion the interests of the working people, national sovereignty and secularism.         
	The CPM leader said the politburo would meet to discuss the reasons for the Lefts rout in its two traditional bastions, Bengal and Kerala.        
	The Left will sit in Opposition, said his CPI counterpart A.B. Bardhan. The mandate is in favour of the UPA.        
	CPI under threat        
	If the results left the CPM gasping, the CPI is in danger of losing its national party status.        
	The party, which contested 57 seats in 23 states, had won only four so far  two in Bengal, one in Tamil Nadu and one in Orissa  and lost in all three seats in Kerala where it won last time.        
	In 2004, the party had won 10 of the 34 seats it had contested with a vote share of 1.4 per cent.        
	According to the criteria set by the Election Commission, a national party needs to get at least 6 per cent votes from at least four states, or win 2 per cent of the total seats in the Lok Sabha from at least three states or should be recognised as a state party in at least four states.

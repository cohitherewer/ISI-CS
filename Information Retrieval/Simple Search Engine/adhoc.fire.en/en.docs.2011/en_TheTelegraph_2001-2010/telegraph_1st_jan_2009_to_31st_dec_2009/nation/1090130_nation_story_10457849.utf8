                                                                                                               HC seeks Mohanty records
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Jan. 29: The Gayatri Panda sexual harassment case involving former Speaker Maheswar Mohanty gathered momentum today with Orissa High Court calling for all case records related to it.        
	In March 2008, Mohanty had stepped down on moral grounds after harassment charges were slapped against him. However, Orissa Human Rights Commission exonerated Mohanty of the charges citing lack of credible evidence in December 2008.         
	Gayatri Panda, 30, the Assembly Marshal challenged the ruling in court stating that the rights panel had no ground to probe into the case without her approaching the panel first. Thirty-five days after admitting the petition, the two-judge bench of Justice I.M. Qudussi and Justice B.P. Ray issued directions to the panel and to the womens commission to submit case records. The court further directed the state counsel to submit the case diary, arising out of the FIR lodged by the victim. Panda had lodged an FIR at Bubaneswar Mahila police station alleging that Mohanty had harassed her after she refused to grant him favours.         
	A criminal case, based on her FIR, is pending before the Bhubaneswar SDJM, while the State Womens Commission is also in middle of their investigations. Pandas counsel Sarat Das argued before the court that dropping charges against the accused by the commission could influence the process of justice. Moreover, the panel had violated justice during the proceeding by not cross-examining the former Speaker, he said.

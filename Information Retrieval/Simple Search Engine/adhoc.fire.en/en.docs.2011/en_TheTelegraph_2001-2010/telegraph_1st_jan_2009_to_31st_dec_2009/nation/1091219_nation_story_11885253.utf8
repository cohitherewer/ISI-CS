  - White paper shows inflated surplus        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Dec. 18: Mamata Banerjee today tabled a white paper on the railways that rejected Lalu Prasads claims of a turnaround during his tenure as minister, say- ing the accounts were tweaked to show inflated sur- pluses.        
	A concept of cash surplus before dividend payments was introduced to make the numbers look good, the paper, presented in the Lok Sabha, said.         
	If these presentation changes had not been done, the accumulated surplus of Rs 89,000 crore during the five-year period (from 2004- 05 to 2008-09) would come down to Rs 39,500 crore, the report said, triggering protests from MPs of Lalu Prasads Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD).        
	The railways performance was below par in the five years, the paper said, adding that the best period financially in the past 20 years was 1991-96.         
	The Congresss C.K. Jaffer Sharief was minister then.        
	Lalu Prasad, present in the House, denounced the dossier as a black paper and no paper at all.         
	My tenure was the best period and there was no dispute on my earnings some officers appear to have misled Mamata Banerjee and she should find out who they are, the RJD chief said.         
	Mamata refused to be drawn into the war of words, telling reporters later: I will say nothing against anybody.        
	Lalu Prasads rival in Bihar, chief minister Nitish Kumar, said the document had exposed the hoax behind the turnaround claims.         
	The white paper has proved Lalu Prasad was resorting to white lies in the context of the railways profit, Nitish said in Patna.        
	Rail officials said the surplus numbers presented during Lalu Prasads tenure also did not take into account arrears paid to staff under the Sixth Pay Commi- ssion proposals. If it had, the surplus would have come down further, they added.        
	Former railway officials appeared to agree with the papers conclusions.         
	(Accounting) norms must be changed in consultation with the Comptroller and Auditor General. Obviously, no such change was approved (by the CAG), former Railway Board chairman J.P. Batra said.        
	Officials said the changes aimed at presenting a rosier set of numbers were made from 2007-08 to impress international lenders and get loans for projects like the freight corridor.         
	The turnaround claims had prompted B-schools like Harvard Business School and the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, and industry chambers to laud Lalu Prasad as a new-age guru.

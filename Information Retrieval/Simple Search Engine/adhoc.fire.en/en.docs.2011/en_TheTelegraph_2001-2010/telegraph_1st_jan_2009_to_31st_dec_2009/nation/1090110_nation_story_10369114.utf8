          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Jaipur, Jan. 9: A two-year-old land allotment case has returned to haunt former Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje with a court today ordering that a FIR be registered against her.         
	Additional civil and criminal magistrate (II) Hitesh Singh Sisodia directed the inspector-general of police, Jaipur, to file a case against the former chief minister for alleged wrongdoing in allotment of land to the Deen Dayal Upadhaya Trust.         
	Raje (in picture), as its chairperson, had been accused of allotting a prime land (7,693 sqm) to the trust near the upmarket Civil Lines area valued at Rs 50 crore for just Rs 40 lakh in 2006. The trust was formed to promote cultural activities. But the government had later told the high court, which was hearing a separate PIL on the issue, that the trust had returned the land.        
	The complaint in the magistrates court had been filed in November 2006 by advocate Krishna Kukkar. He said the land was sought on behalf of the trust in March 2006, but the outfit came into existence after a month, on April 14, 2006.

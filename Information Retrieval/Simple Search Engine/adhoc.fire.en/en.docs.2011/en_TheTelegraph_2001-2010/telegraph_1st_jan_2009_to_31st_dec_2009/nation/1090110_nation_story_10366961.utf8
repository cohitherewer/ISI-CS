The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Civic poll to set stage for final test
                                                                                                               Civic poll to set stage for final test
          LALMOHAN PATNAIK                              
	Cuttack, Jan. 9: The Cuttack Municipal Corporation (CMC) elections set for February 6 would not only herald the poll season, but also test the strength and weaknesses of all major political parties.        
	The CMC area  with 54 wards  is spread across three Assembly segments  Cuttack Barabati, Cuttack Choudwar and Cuttack Sadar  under Cuttack Lok Sabha constituency.         
	All the political parties gearing up for the forthcoming Lok Sabha and Assembly polls would want to bag as many wards as possible in the CMC polls.        
	After a Congress-majority council in 1997, a fractured mandate had prevented any political party to enjoy single majority to form the council in 2003. The failure to strike a pre-poll alliance in Cuttack had affected both the BJP and BJD  the ruling alliance in Orissa. While BJP had cornered 16 of the 48 wards, BJD had ended up with just nine, making post-poll alliance inevitable for them to form the council.        
	The electoral matrix this year, however, has changed with the creation of six new wards by splitting 14 of the existing wards according to population-area ratio under a delimitation exercise.        
	At least 16 corporators have been left with no ward to contest from after the ward rejig, forcing them to eye other wards. Consequently, the number of aspirants for party tickets in different wards had increased. BJD chief Naveen Patnaik has already constituted a seven-member committee for selecting party candidates. The final list of candidates will be released after his clearance, BJD city president Madhusudan Sahu said.        
	The BJD is apparently upbeat after the thumping victory (40 of 60 wards) in Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation elections and has apparently decided to go it alone in the CMC polls.        
	The Congress, on the other hand, is hopeful from the pre-poll split between the BJP and BJD. We hope to bag more wards this time by giving a united effort, city Congress president Suresh Mohapatra said. In the last civic polls, the Congress was restricted to 14 wards, as a breakaway group of the party led by former CMC chairman Ashirbad Behera under the banner of Orissa Congress won three wards.

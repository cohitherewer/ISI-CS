The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Court sends Vijayan probe notice
                                                                                                               Court sends Vijayan probe notice
          JOHN MARY                           Vijayan: Notice served                                  
	Thiruvananthapuram, Feb. 2: Kerala High Court today sent Pinarayi Vijayan a notice hours before the scam-tainted CPM state secretary kicked off a party march.        
	The notice came on a public interest plea seeking a directive to the CBI  which is investigating Vijayans role in a power deal scandal  to go ahead with the probe. The petition argues that the governors sanction, which the investigating agency has sought to proceed against the leader, isnt necessary.         
	Issuing the notices, Justices J.B. Koshy and V. Giri said they would not go into the merits of the corruption case but examine the legal position on whether the governors sanction was needed.        
	The notice, which has not set any deadline for a reply, informs Vijayan about the petitioners stand.        
	A legal expert said the court had exercised its extraordinary powers in serving the notices since it gave the accused an opportunity to present his case. This would enable the court to settle the question of sanction irrespective of the governor/governments decision.        
	Asked about the notice, Vijayan, who led the march from Kasargod, said he would comment once he had the details. In the past, he has told the court a CBI inquiry was not needed as state probes had not named him.        
	Politburo member S. Ramachandran Pillai flagged off the march but chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan, who has refused to accept the party line that Vijayan must be defended politically in the corruption case, did not show up.         
	Later, Achuthanandan said he wouldnt like to share with the media what he had told the politburo about the case. The chief ministers apparent reluctance to toe the party line on his rival persisted even after he met politburo member Sitaram Yechury in Kochi yesterday.        
	Today, Yechury said in Delhi the politburo would discuss the case and take into account contrary viewpoints at its meeting on February 14. The politburo feels the case is politically motivated.         
	Achuthanandan will be in Delhi tomorrow and may meet Yechury and general secretary Prakash Karat. Although Achuthanandan has refused to speak on the controversy publicly, sources close to him say he might look at the option of stepping down as the most principled stand to take if Vijayan is allowed to continue.        
	The public interest petition argues that the governors nod, sought as a measure of abundant caution, was not necessary to proceed against a former minister like Vijayan and cited Supreme Court judgments to back the contention.        
	Vijayan was a minister in 1996 and is accused of showing undue haste and overlooking procedures in awarding a power deal to Canadian firm Lavalin.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP fights lost ally with parivar 
                                                                                                               BJP fights lost ally with parivar 
          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, April 2: The Sangh parivar has marshalled all its resources to give a befitting reply to Naveen Patnaik.        
	While the RSS, VHP and the Bajrang Dal have decided to focus on Orissa as part of their scheme of future politics, the BJP has worked out a plan for all senior leaders to tour the state extensively.        
	BJP sources said apart from L.K. Advani, Rajnath Singh, Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley, the partys Hindutva mascot, Narendra Modi, was expected to address a series of meetings in the state, where Lok Sabha and Assembly elections will be held simultaneously.        
	Modi, the sources said, is expected to exploit religious sentiments in Orissa in the wake of the recent anti-Christian riots.        
	Sources in the Sangh said though the BJP had been rattled by Patnaiks sudden decision to end their alliance, its sister organisations had got the freedom to pursue a kind of politics that was not possible when the BJD-BJP tie-up was in place.        
	The dominant view in the Sangh is that the BJP should have listened to it and walked out of the alliance soon after Swami Laxmananda Saraswatis murder last August that triggered the violence.        
	The BJP, however, thinks that the betrayal card can still work though it would be difficult to mobilise support now as effectively as it could have been done at the time of the VHP leaders murder.        
	The RSS  whose long-term game plan includes ending the influence of the Church among tribals in Orissa  is doing its best to re-ignite passions as part of a larger ploy to cultivate the state as another happy hunting ground like Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh.        
	RSS second-in-command Bhaiya Joshi had last week issued a statement warning the Patnaik government against the continuing persecution of Kandh Hindu vanvasi leaders.        
	Joshi blamed the Church for the killings of Hindu leaders and said the Orissa government should not test the patience of Hindus.        
	The VHP went a step ahead and distributed leaflets prepared by the Dharma Raksha Manch which categorically said the VHP leader was killed by the Church.        
	BJP leaders in Delhi are convinced that neither Patnaiks BJD nor the Congress would get the numbers needed in the Assembly and the BJP would come into play when the time comes to form the government.        
	That will definitely give us a leverage and then we will deal with the BJD from a position of strength. We will tell Naveenbabu what kind of gamble he played without properly calculating his strength, a senior leader said.        
	Mittal role        
	The BJP has quietly asked Sudhanshu Mittal to work in Rajasthan, even as the controversy surrounding the businessmans appointment as Northeast co-in-charge was dying away. Jaitley has protested against his appointment.        
	Mittal has already visited Jaipur twice and participated in election work. Sources said Mittal took up the new assignment on party president Rajnath Singhs instructions.

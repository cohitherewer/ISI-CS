  - Despite difficult moments, Cong to stick to allies         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sonia: Valuable experience                                        
	New Delhi, Feb. 25: Sonia Gandhi today described the Congresss first experiment with running a coalition as a new and valuable experience interspersed with difficult moments, an allusion to pesky partners.        
	We have always believed coalitions impose a culture of restraint and discipline on all partners, she said, appearing to suggest the Congress had been mindful of the Lakshman Rekha in public positions and pronouncements, but not some of the UPA allies.        
	The statement is seen as a veiled warning to the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and prospective ally Samajwadi Party not to play pressure politics on seat sharing in an attempt to extract a good deal.         
	The Congress president was addressing a meeting of the parliamentary party this morning  the last such huddle during the term of the current Lok Sabha.        
	The NCP and the RJD havent been trouble-makers for the Congress over the past five years, but have recently made it clear they would drive a hard bargain on seats. Upset with the stance, the Congress MPs and office-bearers from Bihar, the RJDs base, and Maharashtra, the NCP bastion, suggested the party go solo.         
	Some of the bitterness has crept in after NCP chief Sharad Pawar sent feelers to the Shiv Sena. Maharashtra Congress leaders said they werent sure yet if the overtures were serious or mere posturing by Pawar to put pressure.        
	Despite the strains on ties, Sonia appeared in no mood to entertain the ekla chalo (go-it-alone) line and made it clear that the alliances would stay, sources said.        
	We are continuing our pre-poll alliances with like-minded parties in some states. These are on the basis of a common understanding to uphold secular values, fight communal and divisive forces and combine economic growth with the welfare of the aam aadmi, she said.        
	She reminded the leaders, however, that coalitions didnt lessen their responsibility to strengthen the party. Being in coalition does not dilute our responsibility to strengthen our party organisation everywhere.         
	Sonia advised the leaders to keep their focus national, though state and local concerns may come to the fore in the Lok Sabha elections.         
	Our campaign must emphasise that the forthcoming polls are for electing a national government, a government that has an all-India perspective, a government that has (in mind) the concerns of the entire country, in all its many diversities.        
	She listed some dos and donts for the leaders:        
	Be disciplined and cohesive. We are often our worst enemies.All of us will gain if our party comes back to power.        
	Dont become complacent and take things for granted        
	Shun defeatist attitude. Let us face the coming challenge with boldness, confidence and determination to win.         
	Put party before self        
	Translate the support and goodwill for the Congress into electoral advantage.

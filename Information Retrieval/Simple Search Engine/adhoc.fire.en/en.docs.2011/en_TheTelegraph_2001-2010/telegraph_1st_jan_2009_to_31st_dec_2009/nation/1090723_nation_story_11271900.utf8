	New Delhi, July 22 (PTI): Americas Continental Airlines apologised to A.P.J. Abdul Kalam today, a day after its staff frisked the former President in violation of Indian rules and triggered a furore.         
	The US carrier said it did not intend to offend the former President or the sentiments of the people of the country.        
	We have tendered a formal apology to Dr Kalam and we sincerely hope he will fly with us again, the airline said in a statement.         
	Continental Airlines apologises to Dr Kalam for any misunderstanding and/or inconvenience related to the security screening on April 21.         
	Our intention was never to offend Dr Kalam or the sentiments of the people of India. Continental Airlines takes great pride and is honoured to have flown a respectable leader such as Kalam.         
	Yesterday, the airline had implied there could be no exception in frisking of its passengers for security reasons.         
	Kalam was frisked as he was about to board a Newark-bound flight at the India Gandhi International Airport.         
	The Centre today said it had been aware of the incident and had issued a showcause notice to the carrier on July 9.

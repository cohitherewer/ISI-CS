The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sounds of war: silent dogs and empty roads
                                                                                                               Sounds of war: silent dogs and empty roads
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                          Not barking?            Battle must be brewing       
	New Delhi, Sept. 29: Sometimes listening for a dogs bark can save more lives in a Maoist zone than a bullet-proof vest.        
	The dogs always disappear before an attack: the guerrillas know the strays can forewarn the enemy. But the absent dogs can still sound a warning, if only the forces can read the sign in their silence, a senior Orissa police officer told The Telegraph.        
	Its this ability to observe the little details that look out of place  the hallmark of fictional detectives  that are key to survival in hostile terrain, where even a rustle in the shrubs can portend lurking danger.        
	The signals are provided mostly by a sudden hush  on the roads because the buses arent running, at a factory because local employees have vanished before closing time, in the market because shops have shut early.        
	Or, of course, around the security forces camp where the dogs havent turned up for dinner.        
	Veteran security officials say Maoists and other militants order villagers to kill the dogs or shut them away somewhere for a day or two before a raid. Its a lesson the army has imbibed in Kashmir, and some paramilitary battalions in rebel belts too have taken to feeding leftovers to the dogs to earn their loyalty.        
	If you havent learnt that you need to befriend the local dogs before the local population, the massacres will continue, the Orissa officer said.        
	They are continuing  with over 130 personnel killed by Maoists this year  because few among the central and state police teams in the jungles of Jharkhand or Orissa have been taught at their training schools to pick up the subtle clues.        
	Now, the forces are beginning to teach themselves. Feedback from counter-insurgency personnel to their bosses notes that local villagers often buy first-aid material, and drums to store them in, hours before an attack.        
	Such untaught skills are crucial to survival in battle zones anywhere, a New York Times report says. It quotes a Marine commander in Iraq, Lt Donovan Campbell, about how his platoon escaped a bomb encased in concrete and planted in rubble, about 100 metres from a decoy bomb placed in the middle of the road.        
	One of my marines said, That block looks too symmetrical, too perfect, Campbell said. Unless you know what rubble in that part of Iraq looks like, theres no way youd see that.        
	Similar alertness could have saved police officer B.P. Choubey and 28 of his men, lulled into a sense of security on a Chhattisgarh road they knew was virtually ambush-proof since it passed through a clearing. Choubey had forgotten that BSNL had dug fresh trenches on the flanks to lay telephone wires  ideal spots to plant improvised explosive devices (IEDs).        
	Nobody at Orissas R. Udayagiri had noticed the absence of highway traffic, blocked by Maoists 10 hours before the pre-dawn siege of the town in 2006. In Jharkhand, the guerrillas usually block roads 5km either side of the target site.        
	Nor had anyone at Nalcos Koraput complex cared that 78 casual employees, all local people, had vanished before dinner on April 12 this year. The cost of the oversight: 11 dead CISF men.        
	Indian police academies say nothing about the importance of noting the small changes in the rhythms of rural life, the oddities in behaviour. Besides, the Indian paramilitary and police are overworked  neuroscientists told the NYT that even the most observant brain would not pick up subtle clues if overwhelmed by stress.        
	Not all the clues are noted consciously, though, the NYT report says. Some arrive in the form of hunches or a gut feeling, for instance, of extra tension in the air. As the brain tallies cues, big and small, consciously and not, it may send out an alarm before a person fully understands why.        
	Sgt Don Gomez felt very creepy on a deserted Baghdad road  trash was heaped in a spot where he had never seen it before. Later, the explosives team found a bomb.        
	Sgt Edward Tierney, leading a nine-man patrol in Mosul, saw a parked car, facing opposite traffic, windows rolled up. Two young boys stared out of the back window, faces leaning together.        
	It was hot and a soldier sought permission to approach the car and offer the boys some water.        
	I said no  no, Tierney said. He had an urge to move back before he knew why: My body suddenly got cooler; you know, that danger feeling.        
	Within seconds a bomb exploded, wounding the soldier and probably killing the boys.        
	Tierney often wonders what tipped him off. Maybe it was the angle of the car, or the location, or the sleepiness in the market: perhaps the sum of all of this.        
	I cant point to one thing, he said. I just had that feeling when you walk out of the house and know you forgot something  you got your keys, its not that  and need a few moments to figure out what it is.

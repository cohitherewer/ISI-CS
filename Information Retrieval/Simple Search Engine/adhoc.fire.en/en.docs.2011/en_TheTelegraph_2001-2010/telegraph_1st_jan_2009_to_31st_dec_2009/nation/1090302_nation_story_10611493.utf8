          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          RJD boss gets the vote of Shakeel Ahmed Khan. Telegraph picture                                  
	Gaya, March 1: Is he or isnt he responsible for a better Bihar? Senior RJD leader and deputy leader of the Opposition in the Bihar Assembly, Shakeel Ahmed Khan, today pointed out that chief minister Nitish Kumar was not responsible for a better Bihar.         
	Instead, the RJD leader waxed eloquent about the delayed, but well-deserved, central funding that, he added, led the neglected state towards progress. Talking to the media in Gaya today, Khan accused the chief minister of introducing and indulging in political gimmicks in the name of development.        
	After lashing out at Nitish, Khan defended RJD boss and railway minister Lalu Prasad as the real leader, who had given a voice to the voiceless when some reporters pointed out that his railway chief was no less flamboyant when it came to introducing and initiating projects.         
	Not to be daunted Khan reeled off data to substantiate his claim of the state being flush with central funds.         
	The RJD leader also claimed that the Centre had never before been so generous towards Bihar.        
	The RJD leader added that developmental schemes worth Rs 55,000 crore were introduced by the Indian Railways alone, for the state, while another Rs 16,000 crore was granted for road construction.         
	He added that the Centre had pumped in Rs 6,000 crore into Bihar under the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission (for Patna and Bodh Gaya) and was bearing 90 per cent of the expenditure for rural electrification under the Rajiv Gandhi rural electrification programme.         
	Khan also claimed that the Power Grid Corporation of India was executing schemes worth Rs 500 crore in the state.         
	He pointed out that the Centre has had granted Rs 10,000 crore to Bihar for the Sarva Shikshya Aviyan and another Rs 3,500 crore under the National rural health mission.         
	Instead of spending the amounts judiciously, he added, in several cases the states NDA-led government had failed to spend the fund. Khan said that no more than 30 per cent of the allotted money had been spent under the National Rural Employment Guarantee scheme.         
	Finally, the man went on to quote chief minister Nitish Kumar who recently expressed his satisfaction regarding Centre funding and of having received what he demanded from the planning commission to rest his case.        
	The RJD leader also alleged that the Nitish-led government was indulging in duplicity and were not bringing in alleged offenders to justice.         
	People like Anant Singh and Prabhunath Singh are being treated with kid gloves, while others facing less serious charges are being subjected to stricter punishment, said Khan.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Colonel kidnap false   alarm
                                                                                                               Colonel kidnap false   alarm
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Guwahati, Aug. 6: A frenzied police search for a colonel, abducted in front of his home in Guwahati this morning, ended in a widows house in Rangia a couple of hours later and the officer said he went there willingly.        
	The family of Col Dayal Kakoty, 54, informed the police that he was abducted by three persons, including a woman, in front of his apartment block around 11.45am.         
	The police then launched an operation to rescue Kakoty. He was traced to the womans house a couple of hours later.        
	He (the colonel) told us that he went willingly with her and knew her well for quite some time. He asserted that he had not been abducted as claimed by his family, a police source said.         
	We finally concluded that it was not a case of abduction. It seems it was a personal matter between him and the lady, the source said.         
	Kakoty, who belongs to the Mahar Regiment, was on joining time, which is allowed to army personnel at the time of a transfer.         
	The colonels brother, Dinesh, told the police Kakoty was talking on his cellphone in front of their ancestral house when an autorickshaw stopped and a woman and two youths dragged him in.         
	We are neither aware about his animosity with anybody nor have we received any ransom call, Dinesh said.         
	The police have not registered a case since the army officer himself denied he was abducted. The police source said the familys version was not very convincing as it was not easy to abduct a person in front of his house in daylight.        
	Col Rajesh Kalia, defence spokesperson, said the army had only heard about the incident and the officers family had not approached the authorities.

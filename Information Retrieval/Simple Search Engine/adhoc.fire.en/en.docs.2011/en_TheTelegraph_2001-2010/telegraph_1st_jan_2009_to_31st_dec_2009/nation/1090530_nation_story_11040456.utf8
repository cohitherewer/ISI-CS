	E Ahamed, minister of state for railways        
	The railway ministers  senior and junior  have wasted no time in getting to work while their colleagues talk. If Mamata Banerjee announced a Rs 20 monthly pass for the poor, her deputy E. Ahamed announced a special train from Delhi to his home state Kerala within minutes of taking office. People have been complaining of neglect to Kerala.There is no proper connectivity to the state, he said. Ahamed said he had spoken to Mamata and the train would run from June.    
	A. Raja, IT and Communication        
	Raja, who returns as telecom minister next week, aims to bring down mobile phone tariffs to 10 paise a minute for local calls and 25 paise a minute for STD calls in his second term. Local call rates now vary from 40 paise to Re 1, and STD rates range between Re 1 and Rs 2 a minute.         
	Auctioning of 3G spectrum is on top of my priority list, said Raja, who is now in Chennai to seek his leader Karunanidhis blessings.                
	Farooq Abdullah, new and renewable energy        
	This portfolio is bigger than me, Farooq declared on his first day in office, adding he was happy to do a job that benefits our future generation. His first visitor: son and Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah, who came calling with a request for small hydel power projects for the state.         
	This ministry is a big challenge and I take this challenge head on, Farooq said.          
	Kamal Nath, road transport and highways        
	Kamal Nath is very excited he can change Indias landscape. This is one thing which will change the landscape. If you see the development of Europe, the development of China, everything is based on this major infrastructure portfolio, he said. Nath is also looking to provide stimulus to the economy during the slowdown. It is important that building of roads and highways provides economic stimulus, this provides jobs and this is going to be the biggest challenge.          
	C.P. Joshi, rural development        
	Joshi wants to unite Bharat and India, he told a news conference after taking charge at Krishi Bhavan.         
	His first priority: to protect volunteers involved in social audit under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. Two volunteers were killed in Jharkhand while conducting the audit to check if the scheme was being properly implemented. Narega, as the job scheme is better known, is said to be the big reason behind the Congresss election win.          
	Ghulam Nabi Azad, health         
	Implementing the National Rural Health Mission in letter and spirit, launching the National Urban Health Mission and putting on fast track six new AIIMS are Azads priorities. Health earlier did not get as much importance, especially in the rural areas. For them health care was non-existent. The rural health mission has benefited them immensely and would be a priority area. The programmes performance would be reviewed every six months, he promised.          
	Salman Khursheed, corporate affairs        
	Satyam and the small invester were on Khursheeds mind on his first day in office. The corporate affairs ministry has asked the Serious Fraud Investigation Office to plan a strategy with the CBI for prosecution of the Satyam fraud accused, he said. His priority would be to ensure protection and comfort of the small investor. The governments focus and our ministrys focus will be on the aam aadmi....          
	M. Veerappa Moily, law        
	The next five years will be the period of judicial reforms, promised Moily. Delays and legal costs that put justice out of the reach of the aam aadmi would be cut. And how would he cut delays? Well, one way could be to equip every police station in the country with a forensic lab and speed up investigation, Moily said. The solutions are simple, said the man who has taken charge at a time 3 crore cases are pending.

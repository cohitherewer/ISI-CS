The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Goa blast
                                                                                                               Goa blast
                            
	Oct. 19 (PTI): Links of a Goa ministers wife with the Hindutva group suspected in Fridays blast emerged today as the state government said it was considering a ban on the organisation.        
	Home minister Ravi Naik declared that police would examine transport minister Ramkrishna Dhavalikars wife Jyoti amid reports that she was an office-bearer of Sanatan Sanstha, linked to Malegaon blast accused Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur.        
	Naik said the ban could be imposed if the investigations into the Diwali-eve scooter blasts in Margao confirmed the Sansthas role. We will take the decision only after the investigation is over.        
	Advocate-general Subodh Kantak said the law department was examining whether the Sanstha could be banned by the Centre or a state-specific ban could be imposed.

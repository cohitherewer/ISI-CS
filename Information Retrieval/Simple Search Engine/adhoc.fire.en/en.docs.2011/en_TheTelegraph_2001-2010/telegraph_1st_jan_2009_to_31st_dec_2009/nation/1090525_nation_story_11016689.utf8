The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitish stirs Bihar status pot
                                                                                                               Nitish stirs Bihar status pot
          NALIN VERMA                        Manmohan Singh, Nitish Kumar: Special missive				                                       
	Patna, May 24: Nitish Kumar today wrote to the Prime Minister and sought an appointment in a bid to keep alive the issue of special category status to Bihar.        
	I would seek an early appointment with you to pursue this matter (special status), the chief minister wrote to Manmohan Singh.        
	You are aware that we have for long requested (the status for Bihar), given its poor infrastructure, low tax base, low per capita expenditure, high poverty density and hesitant appetite for private investment.        
	Nitish had sprung the demand just before the Lok Sabha results, announcing his party would support any government at the Centre that would grant special status to Bihar.        
	With the results not yet known and the Congress aggressively wooing Nitish, senior party leaders, including general secretary Digvijay Singh, had immediately accepted the demand.        
	The results, however, showed two things: that the UPA had done unexpectedly well and did not need Nitishs support, and that it had fared poorly in Bihar.        
	Nitishs letter, therefore, may put the Congress-led government in a dilemma. If it does not grant the special status, the chief minister may turn it into a big issue in next years Assembly polls; if it does, Nitish would pocket the credit.        
	What makes the problem especially tricky is that for the Congress, Bihar is a priority state where it wants to repeat its Uttar Pradesh phoenix act.        
	Nitishs letter also reminds Singh about the undelivered Rs 14,800-crore flood relief package for the Kosi belt, and accuses Delhi of creating confusion on the issue by seeking the refund of Rs 1,000 crore prior to the poll results.        
	The letter asks the Centre to withdraw its order allowing only the existing sugar factories to manufacture ethanol, and procure presidential assent to an act of the Assembly that facilitates ethanol production from sugarcane juice.        
	Such a measure would encourage large-scale expansion of the sugarcane-based industry in Bihar, boosting its economy after the loss of its mineral resources since the creation of Jharkhand.        
	The letter says Bihar has been endemically energy deficient with negligible generation capacity and low per capita energy availability.        
	The state investment promotion board has approved 14 thermal power projects to the capacity of 17,817MW. All these projects are languishing in the absence of coal linkage, it complains.        
	Nitish has also asked the Centre to help build roads in Bihar, citing the lack of progress in the construction and four-laning of national highways in the state.        
	The Bihar government had to sanction Rs 711 crore from its own funds to maintain national highways, which are the Centres responsibility, he wrote.

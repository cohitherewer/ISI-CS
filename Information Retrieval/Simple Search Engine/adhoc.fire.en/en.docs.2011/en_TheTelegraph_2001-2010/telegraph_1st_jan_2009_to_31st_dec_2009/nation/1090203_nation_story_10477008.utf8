The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Meltdown no sweat for military spend
                                                                                                               Meltdown no sweat for military spend

	New Delhi, Feb. 2: Indias military expenditure will beat recessionary trends, the government said today, assuring global defence buyers lining up for a show in Bangalore next week that funds for big-ticket purchases were being released and put on fast track.         
	Aero India, the Indian airshow held once every two years, will be bigger than ever before despite aviation-spend being reduced because the Indian Air Force is shortlisting orders that are being fast-tracked.         
	The orders running into billions of dollars are being fast-tracked after the Indian army, navy and the air force urged the government that they needed to make urgent purchases to upgrade their inventories.         
	Despite the meltdown, there will be no scaling down in our (military) modernisation, defence production secretary Pradeep Kumar said here today. In fact, the turnout of companies for our (Aero India) show is good, in fact better than last time, even though the impact of the downturn is being felt in the civilian side.         
	Aero India is primarily an opportunity for military aviation companies to showcase their products for the Indian armed forces. It is also attended by delegations from other buyer countries in Africa and Asia. For the first time in seven editions of the fair, China will be sending a delegation led by the deputy chief of its PLA Air Force.         
	A total of 303 foreign companies have confirmed their participation at Aero India, one more than the number of foreign companies in Aero India 2007. Companies from Romania and Netherlands will be participating for the first time.         
	When asked to comment on how much joy the assurance that Indian military spending will increase will give to these companies, Kumar said: It is a fact that the government will make all funds available for security-related expenditure.         
	Indias defence allocation crossed the trillion-crore-rupee mark last year  more than twice the amount earmarked for education and health. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute ranked India 10th among the top 15 arms spenders in the world. The total outlay for new purchases was more than Rs 48,000 crore.         
	The Centres assurance that more funds will be released comes despite the fact that the defence ministry is, as in most years, unlikely to be able to exhaust the capital outlay because of tardy procurement processes.         
	Kumar sought to excuse the slowness by saying the process of acquiring complex systems is a little long  the technical evaluation takes time. But despite requests for fast tracking, crucial systems have not been acquired. For example, the army has not been able to add to its heavy artillery since 1986.         
	At Aero India 2009, European consortium EADS will be showcasing its Eurofighter Typhoon in India for the first time.         
	The fighter aircraft is in the race for a $10 billion-plus order for 126 multi-role combat aircraft order from the Indian Air Force along with Lockheed Martins F-16 Fighting Falcon, Boeings F-18 Super Hornet, Saabs Gripen, RSK Mig Corporations MiG 35D and Dassault Aviations Rafale.         
	The Indian Air Force is also in the market to buy 125 light utility helicopters, 80 medium lift helicopters, attack helicopters and very heavy lift helicopters. The navy and the army are also beefing up their aviation wings and missile defence systems.

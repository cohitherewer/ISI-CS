                                                                                                               Robbers carry away ATM 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chandigarh, Aug. 1: Two robbers loaded an entire ATM containing cash of over Rs 5 lakh into their car and escaped after beating up the guard in Hoshiarpur last night before being caught a couple of hours later.         
	Police, who were alerted by the guard, flagged down the Maruti Zen in which Lovdeep Singh and Satinder Singh had squeezed the 400kg machine into.        
	The ATM contained Rs 5,23,700. Lovdeep Singh and Satinder Singh went to the ATM on Shimla Pahari Chowk in a Maruti Zen at 1.15am. They threatened the watchman, Sandeep Singh, beat him up, then lifted the 400kg ATM and forced Sandeep to load it in the car boot, Hoshiarpur senior superintendent of police Pramod Ban said.         
	The ICICI bank ATM was not fixed to the ground as some ATMs are. Those fixed to the ground can be removed only by cutting or digging through concrete.         
	An alert was sounded in Hoshiarpur, Gurdaspur and Jalandhar after Sandeep alerted the police.        
	Two constables, Paramjit Singh and Harbans Singh, on duty at a police post outside Hoshiarpur, flagged down the Zen.        
	The robbers panicked and tried to run away. But the two constables caught them after a short chase, Ban said. The robbers were carrying a gas cutter, an LPG cylinder as well as an oxygen cylinder with them. They had come well prepared.        
	The gas cutting equipment was meant to prise open the ATM later.        
	A reward of Rs 5,000 has been announced for the two constables who caught Lovdeep and Satinder, both jobless. Lovdeep is from Maqsoodian village and Satinder is from Adampur village, both in Jalandhar.        
	They have been booked under Section 458 of the IPC which deals with house trespass and house breaking by hurting, assaulting or wrongful restraint. If convicted, they could be jailed for 14 years.         
	Investigations are on to find out if the robbers acted on their own or as part of a gang of bank robbers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Revenge froth in pub city 
                                                                                                               Revenge froth in pub city 
  - Youth anger in Mangalore but BJP banks on traditional families         DEVDAN MITRA AND AJAY SUKUMARAN                         Congress supporters at Sonia Gandhis rally in Mangalore on Sunday. (Bangalore News Photos)				                                       
	On tables at the Froth on Top pub and caf in Mangalore, paper placards proclaim, Lets Vote.         
	Its a local campaign visible across hangouts like restaurants and shops  common enough this election season in most Indian cities.        
	But pubs and votes can be a heady mix in this coastal city.         
	For some, like Jayanthi, who will vote for the first time when Mangalore goes to the polls on Thursday, it could be just the right medicine.        
	An MCA degree holder, the 27-year-old was, in her own words, too lazy to vote in previous elections and also because she was working in Bangalore, where she is currently with an engineering company.        
	This time its different. I am going to Mangalore (her hometown) to vote, against the BJP, says the newly married girl, who describes herself as completely non-political.        
	Like many other youngsters, Jayanthis anger is directed at the BJP because she blames the party for staining the cosmopolitan fabric of the port city which, over the years, has developed into an educational and industrial hub and, therefore, a melting pot of cultures.        
	The spate of strikes on churches last year in Mangalore and Udupi-Chikmagalur, and the January-end attack on the Amnesia Lounge pub on upscale Balmatta Road  the hangout for youths with its high-octane watering holes  made Jayanthi decide she would vote.         
	The attack on the pub, on the women there, was in a way an attack on me, our generation and all that we stand for. I go to pubs regularly but I enjoy with my hard-earned money, says the girl, who, however, requested her real name not be revealed as her conservative parents and in-laws would not approve of her pub habits.         
	It is precisely this chasm that is giving the BJP jitters, and also making it feel smug.         
	Jitters because the party has alienated the youngsters, smug because it perceives its traditional vote bank would not be too affected by the pub attacks.        
	The BJP believes the attack on women at Amnesia  by members of a fringe group called the Sri Ram Sena  has only made it more popular among traditional Hindu families.        
	Ask anyone, theyll say we are right, says a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) worker campaigning for Nalin Kumar Katil, the BJPs 40-year-old candidate challenging veteran Congressman Janardhan Poojary for the newly created Lok Sabha seat of Dakshina Kannada, formerly Mangalore.        
	The RSS worker, however, concedes that the BJP may have lost an opportunity to win over Christian votes in the long run because of the attacks on churches that took place here in August in the wake of the Kandhamal violence in Orissa. But we wont lose any votes, he says, and confidently claims the party would retain its 2004 margin of 33,415 votes.         
	The Congress, whose grasp over Mangalore and most of coastal Karnataka began slipping since the 1980s, has been harping on the attacks. Sonia Gandhi has come to put a lock on the BJPs grand gateway, announced D.K. Shivakumar, the Karnataka Congress working president on Sunday as Mangalore residents gathered to hear the party chief speak at an election rally.        
	In Mangalore and its hilly hinterland, minority votes are a crucial factor, with Muslims and Christians together constituting a third of the electorate of about 15 lakh.         
	The biggest voting community is the Billava, to which Poojary belongs, while the Bunts  who have surnames like Rai (a la Aishwarya) and Shetty (like Shilpa and Suneil)  also make up a sizeable chunk.         
	But Muslims and Christians in any case do not vote for the BJP, and a sizeable portion of Mangalores pub-frequenting youngsters are students and executives who are not registered electors here.        
	Mangalores voting dynamics have also altered post-delimitation, with the BJP stronghold of Coorg going to the Mysore Lok Sabha constituency. Nalin replaces the BJPs state president, D.V. Sadananda Gowda, who is now contesting from neighbouring Udupi-Chikmagalur, which is seen as a safer seat.        
	In the other coastal district of Uttara Kannada, the polarisation is complete. The BJPs Hindutva poster boy, Ananthkumar Hegde, seeking a fourth term, grandly claimed he would not need minority support in his battle with the Congresss Margaret Alva.         
	Hegde, 40, who trounced Alva in 2004 by over 1.77 lakh votes, has emerged as the young role model for hardcore Hindutva followers with his strident statements.         
	Not to be confused with senior party colleague Ananth Kumar (the BJP candidate from Bangalore South), Hegde has called for militarisation of all Hindutva outfits.        
	While the BJP and Congress hold sway in pockets across Dakshina Kannada, the urban vote seems to be the least predictable.         
	The urban, literate people feel this (moral policing) has to stop, says Suryaprakash Bhat, a tax consultant who reckons the incidents over the past year may see urban votes going away from the BJP.        
	In the traditionally prosperous Dakshina Kannada region, which has a diaspora spread across the world, communal violence over issues such as cow slaughter and attempts at polarising Hindus and Muslims in certain pockets have increased in recent years.        
	However, the emergence of Islamist groups such as the Karnataka Forum for Dignity and the Christian outfit Social Action Committee has taken some of the sting off the anti-BJP attack.         
	Religious hatred and fundamentalist politics have spread across the social canvas, says K. Chandra, 39, a software engineer who worked in Mangalore when a Hindu boy didnt have to take permission from maniacs before talking to a Muslim girl.        
	The BJP is also perceived to have shown results and been accessible, especially at the city corporation level. Its true that when you want to get some work done, the BJP is more likely to do it, says Ibrahim, a driver.         
	 Dakshina Kannada and Udupi-Chikmagalur vote on April 30. Uttara Kannada voted on April 23

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Dont rock boat: Cong to Jagan MLAs
                                                                                                               Dont rock boat: Cong to Jagan MLAs
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              Rosaiah    
	New Delhi, Sept. 7: The Congress leadership is planning to continue with K. Rosaiah as chief minister of Andhra Pradesh.        
	Sources revealed that he would be replaced only if the YSR camp demonstrated serious reservations about his continuance.        
	A formal exercise to assess the views of the legislators will be undertaken after the 10-day mourning period. However, state leaders have been sent a clear message that the high command is not willing to yield to any pressure tactic.         
	The sources said the objective of party general secretary Digvijay Singhs visit to Hyderabad was to deliver this stern message.        
	The statement by Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddys son Jaganmohan, reposing faith in Sonia Gandhi and asking his supporters to restrain themselves, came after this message was delivered.        
	We understand your feelings but dont rock the Congress boat, is what Digvijay told the MLAs.         
	The high command made it clear that the next Congress government should appear united, effective and strong, and hence decisions could not be taken on the basis of emotional outpourings.        
	This is being interpreted as an indirect message to Jaganmohan that he is not yet ready for the job and hence there is no point orchestrating demonstrations in his favour.

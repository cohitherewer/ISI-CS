          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, June 9: The human resource development ministry today obtained financial clearance for six new IIMs and 10 new National Institutes of Technology, paving the way for the cabinets approval to launch these institutes.         
	The expenditure finance committee of the government approved the IIMs and NITs promised by the UPA under the Eleventh Five Year Plan, increasing the possibility of at least some institutes starting this year.         
	But the expenditure committee, which scrutinises the financial implications of new projects before the cabinet grants its approval, raised concerns over the HRD ministrys proposal to start 374 model colleges across the country together.         
	The committee, which represents the finance ministry, asked the HRD ministry to prioritise districts that most urgently need the model colleges, sources said.         
	Under the Eleventh Plan, the government is to set up one model college in each of the 374 districts identified as educationally backward. The model colleges are expected to act as examples for other colleges in the district to follow.         
	The ministry has been asked to prioritise between the 374 model colleges... to pick which districts need the colleges most urgently, a senior HRD ministry official said. Officials see this as an impact of the economic slowdown.         
	The prompt clearance to the IIMs and the NITs  projects which add up to Rs 1,000 crore  indicates the governments rush to show results in education, officials said.         
	An amount of Rs 660 crore has been allocated for the six new IIMs  one each in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana and Tamil Nadu.         
	The HRD ministry has been allocated Rs 500 crore for the NITs.        
	CBSE post        
	The department of personnel has sent back for HRD minister Kapil Sibals approval the recommendation made by his predecessor Arjun Singh for the CBSE chairpersons post, said PTI.        
	Arjun had recommended Pragya Srivastava a day before the poll results were announced. Arjun has known Srivastava, an IPS officer, and her husband, an IAS officer, from his days in charge of Madhya Pradesh.

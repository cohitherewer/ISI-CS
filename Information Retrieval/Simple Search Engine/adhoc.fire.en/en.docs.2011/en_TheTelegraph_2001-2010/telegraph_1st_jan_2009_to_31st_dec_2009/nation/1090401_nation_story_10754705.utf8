The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lalu slams Nitish
                                                                                                               Lalu slams Nitish
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, March 31: Taking a dig at Nitish Kumars much publicised Mahadalit card, RJD boss Lalu Prasad on Tuesday accused the chief minister of indulging in gimmickry and said that the states Mahadalits were being taken for a ride by the chief minister.         
	The RJD boss was in the Bodh Gaya to launch candidate Ramji Manjhis election campaign at the sub-divisional headquarters in Sherghati. At the launch, Lalu Prasad said the Mahadalits may be deprived, but they were no fools and would see through the vote game.        
	The Nitish Kumar government has only paid lip service to the Mahadalits and has done little at the grassroots to improve the condition of the community. There was a conspiracy to weaken the Dalits through divisive techniques. I hope that the Mahadalits will not fall prey to the inducements, he said.         
	In a bid to woo mukhiyas (headman), Lalu Prasad claimed that where as the RJD government gave the group power, the Nitish government has humiliated them by using the bureaucracy to get their wings clipped.        
	Now, it is for the Mukhiyas to redeem their position and get back at the administration by using their adult franchise.        
	Virtually patting himself on the back, RJD chief claimed that he has pumped Rs 55,000 crore of the railway for the development of Bihar, something that his rivals have failed to do.         
	Referring to the Nitish-led governments claim of success in the appointment of primary teachers, Lalu Prasad said that ill-qualified persons, a large number of them possessing fake certificates, have been appointed as teachers, thereby putting the the future of the students in jeopardy.         
	The RJD chief also came down heavily on the government for its failure to take advantage of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and said it could not even get job cards made. As a result, a large number of rural poor are now migrating to the other states for jobs, said he.        
	The RJD boss told his audience that the NDA has now become a misnomer as allies such as Naveen Patnaik, Mamata Banerjee, Chandrababu Naidu and Jayalalitha have quit the alliance, with Nitish left to prop up a crumbled political edifice.

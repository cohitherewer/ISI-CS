	New Delhi, Feb. 12 (PTI): Indian scientists today said they had cloned the worlds first buffalo on February 6, but it died of pneumonia less than a week after its birth.        
	The buffalo calf was cloned at the National Dairy Research Institute at Karnal in Haryana using a simpler but advanced version of a technique used to create Dolly the sheep, the first mammal to be cloned.        
	The calf died late last night, institute director A.K. Srivastava said. The infection was caused by complications during delivery, he said, but added that the cloning technique was not faulty.        
	Srivastava said the institute was in the process of producing two more clones and the delivery was due in May and June.        
	A statement issued by the institute said the hand-guided cloning technique was less demanding in terms of equipment, time and skill.

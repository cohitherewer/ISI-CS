The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sonia shuts out Lalu
                                                                                                               Sonia shuts out Lalu
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, March 20: The RJD chief and one of Sonia Gandhis favourite allies, Lalu Prasad, has suddenly lost a bit of favour, it would seem.         
	The railway minister has been waved the red signal from 10 Janpath at least thrice in as many days, sources say. The Congress president, miffed at having been squared off the seat-sharing deal in Bihar, isnt ready to grant him an audience.         
	But the cold shoulder from the UPA chairperson has taken few in the Rashtriya Janata Dal or Ram Vilas Paswans Lok Janshakti Party by surprise. They knew it was coming after the raw deal handed to the Congress.         
	So whats Lalu Prasads mood like these days? Behaal hain, said a party colleague. Hes feeling harassed.         
	Perhaps he should have paid heed to advice given by some around him. Lalu Prasad had apparently been told that a small committee should be formed to distribute seats and that he should detach himself from the process, so as to avert Sonias direct wrath. He never listened. The result is that there is anger with him both within the RJD and outside.         
	Fearing that if the Congress implements its threat of contesting a large number of seats in Bihar, Lalu Prasad and Paswan met late last night to discuss damage control. It is not known what they came up with. But sources said there was a possibility, however remote, that the two might agree to concede a couple of more seats to the Congress to placate Sonia and prevent large-scale division of votes.         
	The Congress has called its central election committee meeting tomorrow and if no alliance is finalised, the party may go it alone, fielding as many as 30 candidates in Bihar.

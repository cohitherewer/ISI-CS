The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Kathmandu trip on Krishna radar, Beijing on mind
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Kathmandu trip on Krishna radar, Beijing on mind
          ARCHIS MOHAN                          SM Krishna                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 20: External affairs minister S.M. Krishna is likely to visit Kathmandu next month to begin the process of repairing India-Nepal relations.        
	The situation in Nepal has India worried, and all of it does not have to do with Chinas growing influence in the Himalayan country.         
	A visit by the foreign minister has become necessary, said sources in the government, adding that there has been a surge in anti-India resentment and not just among Maoists. Many in Nepal blame India for the mess in their countrys political landscape.        
	Nepals growing affinity for all things Chinese remains an irritant for India. That Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal  considered close to India  will be Beijings state guest for four days from December 26 rankles with foreign policy minders in Delhi.         
	Madhav Nepal is visiting China despite South Block dropping gentle hints to dissuade him. China has promised to spend Rs 220 million to modernise Nepals army.         
	We in India have overplayed the Chinese factor. There is a strong sentiment in Nepal that India is responsible for outflanking the Maoists and for their exit from the government earlier this year. We need to look at this in isolation, not connect everything that goes wrong for us in Nepal to China, said a former diplomat.        
	The foreign ministry is tight-lipped about Krishnas itinerary. It is apprehensive this might provide further grist to India-baiters in Nepal.         
	The challenge is to project India as a friend, not the big brother which manipulates their democratic process, the diplomat said.         
	Indias headache also relates to the demand by the Nepal Ma oists for integration of their troops with the Nepal army. The Indian Army views this with suspicion. Earlier this year, the Maoists had walked out of the government after the Nepal army turned this demand down  many in Nepal believe on Indias behest.        
	On Thursday, the Sashastra Seema Bal that guards the Indo-Nepal border said China was establishing cultural centres along the border.

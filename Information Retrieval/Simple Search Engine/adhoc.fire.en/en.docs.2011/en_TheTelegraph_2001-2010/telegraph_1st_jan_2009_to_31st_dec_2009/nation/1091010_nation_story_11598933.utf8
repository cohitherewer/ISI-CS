                          Obama rsquo;s daughter Malia with the family rsquo;s pet dog Bo in September. (Reuters)                    
	Excerpts from Barack Obamas statement  probably the most tricky speech the master orator has delivered yet  after the Nobel peace prize announcement that stunned the world, which greeted the news with a mixture of scepticism, incredulity and some praise.              
	Well, this is not how I expected to wake up this morning.        
	After I received the news, Malia walked in and said, Daddy, you won the Nobel peace prize, and it is Bos birthday. (Bo is the First Dog)        
	And then Sasha added: Plus, we have a three-day weekend coming up.        
	So its  its good to have kids to keep things in perspective.        
	I am both surprised and deeply humbled by the decision of the Nobel Committee.        
	Let me be clear, I do not view it as a recognition of my own accomplishments, but rather as an affirmation of American leadership on behalf of aspirations held by people in all nations.                    
	Dont deserve        
	To be honest, I do not feel that I deserve to be in the company of so many of the transformative figures whove been honoured by this prize, men and women whove inspired me and inspired the entire world through their courageous pursuit of peace.        
	But I also know that this prize reflects the kind of world that those men and women and all Americans want to build, a world that gives life to the promise of our founding documents.        
	And I know that throughout history the Nobel peace prize has not just been used to honour specific achievement; its also been used as a means to give momentum to a set of causes.        
	And that is why I will accept this award as a call to action, a call for all nations to confront the common challenges of the 21st century.        
	Now, these challenges cant be met by any one leader or any one nation. And thats why my administrations worked to establish a new era of engagement in which all nations must take responsibility for the world we seek.        
	Nuclear weapons        
	We cannot tolerate a world in which nuclear weapons spread to more nations and in which the terror of a nuclear holocaust endangers more people.        
	And thats why weve begun to take concrete steps to pursue a world without nuclear weapons: because all nations have the right to pursue peaceful nuclear power, but all nations have the responsibility to demonstrate their peaceful intentions.        
	We cannot accept the growing threat posed by climate change        
	And thats why all nations must now accept their share of responsibility for transforming the way that we use energy.        
	We cant allow the differences between peoples to define the way that we see one another. And thats why we must pursue a new beginning among people of different faiths and races and religions, one based upon mutual interest and mutual respect.        
	The effort must include an unwavering commitment to finally realise that  the rights of all Israelis and Palestinians to live in peace and security in nations of their own.        
	Commander speaks        
	And even as we strive to seek a world in which conflicts are resolved peacefully and prosperity is widely shared, we have to confront the world as we know it today.        
	I am the commander in chief of a country thats responsible for ending a war and working in another theatre to confront a ruthless adversary that directly threatens the American people and our allies. Im also aware that we are dealing with the impact of a global economic crisis that has left millions of Americans looking for work.        
	These are concerns that I confront every day on behalf of the American people.        
	Some of the work confronting us will not be completed during my presidency. Some, like the elimination of nuclear weapons, may not be completed in my lifetime.        
	But I know these challenges can be met, so long as its recognised that they will not be met by one person or one nation alone.        
	For the world         
	This award is not about the efforts of my administration; its about the courageous efforts of people around the world.        
	And thats why this award must be shared with everyone who strives for justice and dignity; for the young woman who marches silently in the streets on behalf of her right to be heard, even in the face of beatings and bullets; for the leader imprisoned in her own home because she refuses to abandon her commitment to democracy.

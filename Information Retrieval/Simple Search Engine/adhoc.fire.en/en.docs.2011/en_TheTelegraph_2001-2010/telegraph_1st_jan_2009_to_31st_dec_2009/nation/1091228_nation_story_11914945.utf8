          ANANYA SENGUPTA                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 27: A 15-year-old girl has braved slurs on her character to testify in court and nail the man who had abducted her and raped her at knifepoint for nine days.        
	Shweta (name changed) had been blindfolded and starved over the entire period by neighbour Shamshad Ahmad, but she had enough spirit to accompany her parents to the police station the day she was freed and deposit her clothes for examination.        
	Ahmad was sentenced to seven years rigorous imprisonment on December 23 by a court that rejected his claims that Shweta was over 16, was having an affair with him, and had eloped with him.        
	Social workers who work with child victims of rape say the accused and their lawyers regularly adopt such smear tactics  a reason why the girls stay away from court appearances. Rape victims are not required to testify personally in court, but their absence makes convictions harder to obtain, said Raj Mangal Prasad, of Delhi-based NGO Pratidhi, who lauded Shwetas courage.        
	The public were evacuated from the courtroom for Shwetas depositions, but Prasad said: When a minor goes to court, even if the trial is in camera, she is asked questions that are morally wrong for a child to even overhear.        
	Shweta, a Class IX student in Delhi, said she was walking to school at 6am on June 25, 2007, when she saw Ahmad in a vehicle.        
	He forced me to sit in the vehicle and closed my mouth with his hands. Then he took me to a house and kept me in a closed room. He raped me thrice the next day, and then again and again, till I managed to get out of the house while he was asleep and call my father. When he got to know about the call, he... dropped me near my house, the girl said.        
	She said she was given nothing to eat for nine days and survived on water. There was just one cot. Whenever I wanted to go the bathroom, I was taken there at knifepoint. He always kept my face and eyes covered with cloth.        
	Shwetas detailed and consistent statements became invaluable evidence, prompting the court to reject Ahmads allegations.

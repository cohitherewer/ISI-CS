(PTI)                                       
	New Delhi, Feb. 19: The Supreme Court today asked Madras High Court bar associations to explain the frequent strikes that have brought work to a virtual standstill.        
	The order came on the petition of an advocate who said no bail petitions had been disposed of in the past 10 days and the high court had worked for only nine days since reopening in early January after the winter vacation.        
	The apex court order asking for an explanation came on a day advocates clashed with police trying to arrest two 
  of their colleagues at the high court for Tuesdays attack by pro-LTTE lawyers on Subramanian Swamy.        
	R. Muralidharan, who filed the plea in the Supreme Court, said attacks and intimidation of lawyers who ignored the strike calls had become common in recent weeks.        
	Swamy, too, was pelted with rotten eggs because he had defied a strike call, and for iterating his stand that LTTE chief Prabhakaran should be deported to India and made to stand trial for the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi.        
	Harish Salve, arguing the case for Muralidharan in the apex court, said the disruptions had started affecting the courts work and left several accused, who would have been released if their bail pleas were heard, languishing in jails. Frequent strikes will erode the faith of people. Once people realise no justice is being done in courts, the are bound to resort to extra-judicial and extra-legal methods to resolve disputes, the petition said.        
	An apex court bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan also sent notices over the strikes to the Bar Council of India, which regulates the professional conduct of lawyers, and to the high courts registrar-general.        
	The Supreme Court had banned lawyer strikes in 2002. Three years later, it clarified lawyers couldnt even go on token strikes, decisions Muralidharans plea has highlighted.        
	Salve argued before the bench that recent lawyer strikes werent even about matters affecting the fraternity. Initially, the strikes were against problems (faced by lawyers). But now sometimes it is the Sri Lankan issue, another time it is the changes in the CrPC.        
	The petition says the high court registrar should spell out the number of days that proceedings have been held normally. There is no justification for abstention of work indefinitely for a large number of days, it said, adding the high court in any case only had 210 working days a year.        
	The petition likens the show of strength by the bar associations enforcing the strikes to militant trade unionism and says it infringes on other lawyers right, guaranteed by the Constitution, to practice their vocation.        
	Muralidharan, registered with the Tamil Nadu Bar Association, says in his plea strike calls are given at hurriedly convened meetings and without proper discussions.The petition points to increasing politicisation of the bar and asks if the lawyer strikes serve the causes they apparently to seek to champion. While casualties of Tamil civilians (in Sri Lanka) call for concern, it is difficult to understand how paralysing work of the court in any manner will come to the rescue of the Tamil civilians.

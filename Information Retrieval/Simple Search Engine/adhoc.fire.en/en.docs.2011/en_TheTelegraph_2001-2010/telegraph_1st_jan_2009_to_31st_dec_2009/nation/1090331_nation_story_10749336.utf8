          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 30: A Supreme Court judge today told a Muslim boy he would not permit Talibanisation and threw out his plea against his school that expelled him for wearing a beard against rules.        
	Justice Markandeya Katju, one of the judges on the bench, chastised Mohammed Salim and his lawyer, saying: We dont want to have Taliban in the country. Tomorrow a girl student may come and say that she wants to wear a burqa, can we allow it?         
	B.A. Khan, Salims counsel, said keeping a beard was essential to a Muslims religious beliefs. But the judge shot back, telling Khan: But you dont sport a beard.

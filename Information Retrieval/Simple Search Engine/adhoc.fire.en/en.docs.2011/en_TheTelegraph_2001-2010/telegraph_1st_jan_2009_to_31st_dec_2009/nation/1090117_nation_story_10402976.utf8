The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Is singh king or is it the police sticks?
                                                                                                               Is singh king or is it the police sticks?
                            
	Amar Singh has explained his bandaged head saying he received two blows from police sticks in Uttar Pradesh yesterday. Can he make the story stick?        
	Party colleague and Bhojpuri singer Manoj Tiwari was by his side yesterday. He repeated the police version today.        
	Singh broke a glass door (at Gorakhpur airport where police had detained him) by banging his head against it in frustration, Tiwari said in Delhi.        
	Amar, however, insisted he received two lathi blows and laughed off the police version. I am not Akshay Kumar (known for stunts). I am not Singh is King, he said.        
	He, however, is certainly Singh is general secretary and would have expected Tiwari, who hopes to be Samajwadi Party candidate from Gorakhpur, not to contradict him.        
	Tiwari said the police were determined to prevent him, Amar and party MP Jaya Bachchan from entering Gorakhpur and agitating against Mayavati. The police virtually wrestled with Singh to stop him, he said.         
	The Gorakhpur administration claims Amar isnt injured at all.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Airline sheds hostess flab
                                                                                                               Airline sheds hostess flab
                                          
	New Delhi, Jan. 5 (PTI): Air India has sacked 10 overweight air hostesses after they refused to take up alternative ground duties.         
	Airline sources said the services of the air hostesses, who were grounded by the national carrier for being overweight, were terminated for their failure to cut the kilos to acceptable standards and their refusal to take up alternative ground duties.        
	An airline spokesperson said the air hostesses were sacked strictly under the terms of their appointment, a claim dubbed illegal by the 10 women.        
	The rules prescribe different weight limits according to the height and age of the air hostesses. For an 18-year-old air hostess with a height of 152cm, the maximum weight permissible is 50kg, while for air hostesses between 26 and 30 years and a height of 152cm, the weight limit is 56 kg.         
	Sources said the overweight hostesses were given sufficient opportunity to reduce their weight. They were also offered alternative jobs on the ground that they refused to accept. They said more air hostesses have been served similar notices.        
	The sacked 10, however, said the national carrier had acted illegally as they were not served any notice and the decision was taken when the matter was pending in the Supreme Court. The action is illegal and against natural justice. I will soon file an application in the Supreme Court against the order, said advocate Arvind Sharma, the lawyer representing the air hostesses.        
	The air hostesses alleged that the airline was trying to terminate their services on the pretext of their being overweight.        
	Air India, however, justified its action saying Delhi High Court had upheld the action taken against the overweight air hostesses and the verdict had not been stayed by the apex court.         
	Last September, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the plea of the air hostesses challenging Air Indias decision.         
	If we find merit (in air hostesses plea) we will restore your services, the court said, while issuing a notice to the airline on the air hostesses petition.

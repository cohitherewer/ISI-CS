                                                                                                               SC Shopian lash on high court
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 24: The Supreme Court today came down heavily on Jammu and Kashmir High Court for ordering action against officers in the Shopian rape-and-murder case without any proof.        
	The high court order is unjustified. The high court seems to have overreacted, Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan said, referring to the arrest of the four officers and also the censuring of the state government.        
	The two-judge bench headed by the Chief Justice criticised the high court for passing sweeping orders beyond its jurisdiction, including directives to arrest the four, examining their DNA samples and subjecting them to narco-tests.        
	The high court had also asked lower courts not to hear their bail pleas, reserving the power for itself.        
	Today, the Supreme Court allowed the officers to move a lower court in Shopian for bail. That court will decide their plea as soon as possible without being prejudiced by any observations made by the high court or the Supreme Court, Balakrishnan said.        
	The stay on the narco-tests, granted on July 20 after two of the officers moved the apex court, will continue, the bench said.         
	Rape and murder is a serious crime. If there is a serious crime in any area, it should be properly investigated instead of arresting the entire neighbourhood. What evidence was available before the high court? the Chief Justice asked.        
	The high court had ordered the arrest of Shopian police chief Javed Iqbal Mattoo, deputy superintendent Rohit Baskotra, station house officer Shafiq Ahmed and sub-inspector Ghazi Abdul Kareem following a PIL by the state bar association.         
	The plea had been filed in the wake of widespread protests against the May 30 rape and murder of the two women, allegedly by security forces. The police had tried to pass off the deaths as cases of drowning.        
	Mukul Rohatgi, the officers counsel, contended that the state government didnt have a shred of evidence. There is nothing to show their (the cops) involvement in the rape and murders. Negligence or lack of control could only be held against them.        
	He said the high court had not given them an opportunity to defend themselves. They were arrested under general suspicion.        
	The state governments senior counsel, Harish N. Salve, contested the arguments, saying they were implicated during the probe. These are the officers who tried to pass the deaths off as drowning, Salve said.         
	At this point, the chief justice stepped in. Even then they have the protection of the law, he said, adding that the officers had the right to move a sessions court for bail.        
	While the whole state was on fire, they did a complete whitewash job for (the) police, Salve protested.         
	But Balakrishnan reminded the state government that it couldnt ignore the basic principles of the rule of law. You have to follow the principle of rule of law, the procedure must be correct, he said.

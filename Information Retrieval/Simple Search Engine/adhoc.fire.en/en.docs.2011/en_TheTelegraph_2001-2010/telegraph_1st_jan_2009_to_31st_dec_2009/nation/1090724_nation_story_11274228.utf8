The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Going to Puri? Take ID proof 
                                                                                                               Going to Puri? Take ID proof 
          PRIYA ABRAHAM                               
	Bhubaneswar, July 23: Be prepared to be turned away from Puri hotels if you dont have an ID card.        
	Police in the pilgrim town, one of Bengals favourite getaways, have sent a directive that says identity cards are a must to put up anywhere.        
	The move follows a spate of crimes, including murders and car-jackings targeting tourists, after which the police suspect the culprits fled in the guise of visitors.        
	The rule came into force today, police chief Somendra Priyadarshi said, but appeared to offer a months time before it is enforced strictly. We understand it will take at least a month to spread the information among visitors, most of it will be by word of mouth.        
	Voter identity card, passport, driving licence, PAN card, credit card with photograph or any such proof with photograph would be accepted. These will have to be produced on checking into any commercial place of residence, a term used to ensure that all kinds of boarding facilities are covered. If it is a family tour, the ID card of the head of the family will be enough. Hotels will have to keep a photocopy of the cards.        
	Visiting cards in the absence of photo IDs will not do. The cards might need to be shown while youre strolling on the beach or walking on the roads.

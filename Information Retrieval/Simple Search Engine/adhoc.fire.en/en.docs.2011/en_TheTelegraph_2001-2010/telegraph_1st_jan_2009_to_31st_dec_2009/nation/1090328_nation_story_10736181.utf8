The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Post-poll buzz in Sharad silence
                                                                                                               Post-poll buzz in Sharad silence
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 27: Janata Dal (United) president Sharad Yadav sparked speculation with his silence on post-poll options on a day CPM boss Prakash Karat declined to tar Bihars ruling party with a saffron brush.        
	Yadav, however, appeared uncomfortable with the compliments raining from the secular forces  at least from the Congress, which has been praising the Dal(U) and its leader Nitish Kumar.        
	They (the Congress) are doing all this to deflect attention from the desertions by their allies in the south, Yadav said. Asked if his party was thinking of holding alliance talks with the Congress, he said: We are currently in the NDA.        
	Unlike Lok Janshakti Party leader Ram Vilas Paswan, who has been affirming again and again that he would remain with the UPA, Yadav refused to say anything about the post-poll situation. Three months is a very long time, he said.        
	The CPM, though, tried to warm up to the Dal(U). We dont equate Bihar with other BJP-ruled states like Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka. Bihar is not a BJP-led government either, Karat told reporters.        
	CPM leader Sitaram Yechury had met Yadav a few days ago, but the Dal(U) leader claimed the meeting had nothing to do with politics.        
	The problem of the Dal(U) is that it can tie up with the secular forces only by sacrificing its government in Bihar. This has prompted Nitish to take a firmer line on the BJP alliance than Yadav.

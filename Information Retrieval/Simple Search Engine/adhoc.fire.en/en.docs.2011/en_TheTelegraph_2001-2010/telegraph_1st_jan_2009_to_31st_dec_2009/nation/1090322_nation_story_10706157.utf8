The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Amarnath pill to fight terror
                                                                                                               Amarnath pill to fight terror
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 21: The RSS believes the Mumbai terror attack was somehow linked to the nexus between selfish politicians and anti-national forces of the kind responsible for coining such terms as Hindu terror in the wake of the Malegaon blast probe. It also prescribes ultra-Hindu nationalist protests on the Amarnath pattern as a solution to ills the country is afflicted with.        
	These controversial sentiments have been expressed in the annual report of the RSS submitted at a programme at its Nagpur headquarters yesterday and could stir fresh national debate on the internal aspects and implications of the Mumbai attack carried out by Pakistani terrorists.        
	The chapter called Scenario dwells on the national situation, primarily in the context of terrorism, the Amarnath land row, the Kandhamal riots and the Malegaon episode. Although the arguments are vague, the message is clear: the RSS finds a common thread between the attempt to malign Hindu saints and the Mumbai attack.        
	While explaining the ploy to implicate Hindu outfits and saints in the Malegaon blasts, the report says: This sinful nexus between the selfish politicians and anti-national forces was thoroughly exposed by the dastardly terrorist attack on Mumbai on 26 November.        
	Which nexus the RSS is hinting at is not clear but the previous paragraph recalls how the political forces joined hands to malign Hindu outfits.        
	The report says: On the pretext of the involvement of some Hindu youths and a sadhvi in the Malegaon blast case, these hardline fundamentalist and secessionist forces have tried to create an illusionary and self-contradictory lie called Hindu terrorism. Ridiculous aspersions were cast on our security forces; reprehensible attempts were made to defame Hindu saints, society and organisations.        
	In order to hide their discredited failure in tackling terrorism, Hindu-hating political forces joined hands with the forces that are out to destroy the morale of the Hindu society and tried to put it up at par with the utterly communal and anti-national violent forces, thus hoping to harvest votes in the coming Lok Sabha elections.        
	The report says the Amarnath protest has showed us the way to conquer all our problems and the global forces that are inimical to our nation.         
	Patriotic people of Jammu and Ladakh... have to be emulated. The agitation has finally destroyed the intransigence of the anti-national forces and the arrogance of power of the rulers.

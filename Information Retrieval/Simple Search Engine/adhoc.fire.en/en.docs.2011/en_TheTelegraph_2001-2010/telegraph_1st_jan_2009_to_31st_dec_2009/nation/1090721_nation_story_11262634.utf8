The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Advani cries to Clinton on Pak
                                                                                                               Advani cries to Clinton on Pak
          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, July 20: L.K. Advani has found a shoulder to cry on  America.        
	The leader of the Opposition today left political circles aghast after he turned a courtesy call by Hillary Clinton into a grudge session against the Manmohan Singh government.        
	The BJP veteran told the US secretary of state that the Prime Minister had broken national consensus by agreeing to de-link action on terrorism from the Indo-Pak composite dialogue, dragging a third party into domestic discord.        
	Advani, who according to party sources asked Clinton to understand Indias concerns, also nearly succeeded in doing something that both his party and India are dead against: involvement of America in bilateral ties with Pakistan.        
	No other BJP leader was present during the 45-minute talks. Later, senior party leader Sushma Swaraj said Clinton heard Advani out but didnt react.        
	Sushma said Advani forcefully raised the joint statement India and Pakistan released in Egypt last week, though Clinton had come to discuss other issues like environmental change. The Indo-US nuclear deal, she added, was not discussed at all, nor was the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.        
	Although many BJP leaders The Telegraph contacted did not find any problem with Advanis decision to raise an internal discord with a foreign guest, at least one wondered why foreign policy experts like Jaswant Singh or Yashwant Sinha were not consulted.        
	The two former foreign ministers are sulking these days and usually stay away from helping the party on matters that require their expertise.        
	Advani said he had experience in handling matters related to cross-border terrorism as he was a former home minister and told Clinton he was surprised that violence-racked Balochistan  where Pakistan has intermittently alleged a covert Indian hand  had been mentioned in the joint statement.        
	He said the inclusion of Balochistan suggested that India was in the dock for fomenting trouble in Pakistan. We should not try to placate others by ignoring the facts, Advani was quoted as telling Clinton. Such wrong moves will not improve ties between India and Pakistan.        
	A key paragraph in the joint statement that critics have seized on as a climbdown under US pressure says: Both Prime Ministers (Singh and Pakistans Yousaf Raza Gilani) recognised that dialogue is the only way forward. Action on terrorism should not be linked to the composite dialogue process and these should not be bracketed...        
	Sushma said Advani told Clinton his party was not against dialogue and recalled how former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had gone to Lahore by bus and then President Pervez Musharraf was invited to Agra despite the Kargil incursion.        
	But there had been a consensus within the country after the Mumbai attacks last November that Pakistan would have to show results on cracking down on terror, and the joint statement sought to disrupt that accord, Advani told Clinton.        
	Those critical of Advanis decision to raise the joint statement with Clinton said it was tantamount to lodging a complaint against the Prime Minister with the US administration.        
	Advani, they added, went a step further, cautioning that commitments made by the government in disregard of the national consensus would not be effective and asking American to appreciate Indias concerns.        
	Sushma said Clinton did not at any point try to confront Advani. She also repeatedly stressed that the former BJP chief was satisfied with the meeting.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Astute politicker, from new stable
                                                                                                               Astute politicker, from new stable
										        VALUE JUDGEMENT        Overall      SANKARSHAN THAKUR                              
	The day after he was anointed Prime Minister five summers ago, a photograph of Manmohan Singh appeared in the newspapers  seated at home on an unfussy sofa, wife Gursharan handing him a glass of water. That was to remain one of the defining images of the Manmohan premiership. No frills, no paraphernalia, no tamasha  the gathered drumbeaters were quickly asked to go home, the bluster ceased before it had opportunity to begin. He put up a Do Not Disturb sign outside and went to work.   
	Here was a Prime Minister arrived from different stables, a turbaned contrast to all his predecessors, anti-climactic King of the surrogate kingdom of Sonia Gandhi. A leader sans followers, an authority sans authority, personal or political, a baffled innocence cast into the perilous jungle of coalitions. A Prime Minister possessed of an unprecedented amalgam  simple, secular, well-meaning, erudite, honest to a fault. And in a creed that puts premium on power at the expense of all else, he stood among the few never noticed lusting after the Chair. A Prime Minister who refused to countenance the daily sycophancy of garlands and of courts. A Prime Minister who, perhaps to his and the Congresss disadvantage, did not crave crowds or leap to podiums.         
	Could such a man last? The Prime Ministers office, after all, is no dressing room of virtue. Vice, quite often, as Machiavelli reminded us, is a key virtue in rulers. The art of manipulation and manoeuvring. The temper to manage contradictions. The sagacity to employ faith and to employ suspicion. The talent to marry firmness with flexibility. Sleight of hand. Glibness of tongue. The courage, most of all, to run against the tide, which can only come with a sense of authority. Which he only enjoys by proxy; when he needs to use it, he has to use Sonias political authority because he has none of his own.         
	The pitfalls were obvious and many. At the best of times, the prime ministership of India is a crown ridden with thorns. A huge country, a myriad contradictions, a million problems and no easy solutions. And with a new government, there were newer, higher expectations. Coalitions can be unruly beasts. The stable Manmohan came from was known for its refinements, not for the art of seeing through a rough ride.     
	There were those who thought Manmohan would be a weakling and a dummy owing to his lack of a personal political base, a Prime Minister without clout liable to be manipulated by allies from within the government and overshadowed by Sonia from without.         
	How wrong they were. How firmly and rigidly Manmohan was to chuck that impression into the bin. When it came to the Indo-US nuclear deal, his crowning contribution, he believes, to posterity, he staked it all  opponents within, adversaries without  and won the bout.        
	And he did it, stunningly, by proving himself a consummate politicker  securing a floor deal with the Samajwadi Party to offset the Lefts loss, engineering enough defections from the Opposition benches. This was war and all was fair in it. No time to parade virtues, this, a few vices would serve well. He was unabashed about unveiling them and he had his way.         
	And in doing so, he underlined how profoundly wrong the popular caption to his prime ministership had always been. This man was not apolitical, far from it. Anyone who has served more than half a dozen Prime Ministers, as technocrat or politician, could not be devoid of what it means to do politics. He was probably more astute than most  he abjured and embraced politics when it suited him.         
	But heres where Sonia also stepped in and played her bit. She, in fact, is as much part of the story of Manmohans prime ministership as the Prime Minister himself, as much the hand trying to structure a new work ethic in place. The template of the role she set herself was embedded in her decision to give up the prime ministership when it was hers for the taking. She was there to guide and assist the man she picked as Prime Minister, not to undermine or override him.         
	Over the years, a tantalisingly pleasant balance between the head of government and the head of party was on show, with nary a hint of discord. Sonia succeeded in not appearing overbearing, Manmohan succeeded in projecting himself as a businesslike Prime Minister who isnt obliged to display sycophancy.        
	As one Congress leader said: Sonia trusts Manmohan completely and Manmohan draws all his political clout from her. But once he draws the line, as in the case of the nuclear deal, everybody knows Sonia is in agreement and so dissent does not get out of hand.         
	Social scientist Yogendra Yadav of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies believes the division of labour between the administrative and the political was a good idea to work with. Splitting political functions on these lines can actually be healthy, there is the possibility, always of the government devoting itself to governance while the political work is handled by the party, and that has happened to a great degree.         
	But hardboiled political hands in the Congress and the UPA appear to disagree with formulations that they consider theoretical or academic. They often saw a duality unfolding rather than a tandem. A communist leader with first-hand familiarity of UPA affairs said, for instance: It was often clear that the Prime Minister and his party were at loggerheads, on economic issues and the nuclear deal, for instance, and as a result it often appeared the whole system was pulling two ways.        
	But then, that is where the unique Sonia-Manmohan relationship came most into play. And at least the Congress boss is happy enough with the experiment to unequivocally seek an encore  the novice of 2004 is the frontrunner in 2009, at least in the UPAs scheme.         
	You could have expected a man of his limited experience and exposure to political rough-and-tumble to get rattled at the hint of crisis. A rash move. A desperate outburst. A show of jangled nerves. Not Manmohan Singh. He fought his battles  and won most of them  but he has managed that with a grace and dignity seldom witnessed. And at the end of his first term, Manmohan Singh is a man in control if not in command.        
	 Concluded

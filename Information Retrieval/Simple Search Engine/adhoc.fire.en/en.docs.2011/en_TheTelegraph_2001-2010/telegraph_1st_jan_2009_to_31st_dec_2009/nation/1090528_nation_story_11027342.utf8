                                                                                                               Son identifies suicide victim
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, May 27: The mystery behind yesterdays temple suicide was unravelled today when the victims son identified her.        
	Somnath Das today identified Saria Das, 55, his mother and the woman who hanged herself in the holy shrine of Sri Jagannath Dham Puri.         
	Police confirmed that Somnath Das identified his mother and gave clues to what may have possibly led to the tragic step.         
	Das apparently wished to die as a sadhaba  a term used to describe a married woman.         
	Saria, a resident of Tangi at Khurda district, travelled to Puri a few days ago to seek blessings for her ailing husband Laxman Das who recently was overcome by paralysis.        
	According to son Somnath, his mother was terrified by the thought of her life after her husbands death, so much so that she secretly stayed back at the temple on Monday night and took her life early in the morning.        
	But, the son added: There was no other family disturbance.         
	Das is an employee at the district office of an Kendu leaf production centre in Phulbani.        
	The body was found hanging from the roof of a shed used for storing salt at Koili Baikuntha, one of the temple gardens.         
	However, the incident raised speculation regarding the temple security as nearly 500 personnel are supposed to guard the shrine at night and ensure that no visitor is staying behind.         
	After the death, temple administration suspended two of its security personnel and launched an inquiry into the matter.         
	A mahasnan, a ritual to cleanse the temple, was performed delaying daily rituals by four hours yesterday, while security was beefed up.

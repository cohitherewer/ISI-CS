The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | NCP, BJD tie up; no word on seats yet
                                                                                                               NCP, BJD tie up; no word on seats yet
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Naveen Patnaik and Praful Patel: All smiles                                  
	Bhubaneswar, March 21: The NCP has agreed in princip le to tie up with the BJD for next months Lok Sabha and Assembly elections although the crucial seat-sharing formula was yet to be chalked out.        
	NCP leader and Union civil aviation minister Praful Patel flew from New Delhi by a special flight this afternoon to meet chief minister and BJD chief Naveen Patnaik.        
	Both the leaders described todays talks as very meaningful.         
	The final results will be known in a couple of days, said Naveen, who was closeted with Patel at his residence for more than an hour.        
	We have agreed to go together. I am sure we will provide meaningful support to Naveens endeavour to bring back his party to power and also our combination will win a significant number of seats in the Lok Sabha, said Patel.        
	Expressing his confidence that the Sharad Pawar led NCP would emerge stronger after the coming elections, the NCP leader said today was the first round of discussions with the BJD and the seat-sharing arrangements were expected to be finalised within a day or two.        
	Patel exuded confidence that Sharad Pawar-led NCP would emerge stronger in the coming elections.        
	On NCPs decision to go into an alliance with different parties in different states, Patel said: Our line is very clear. We are a national party and we have adjustments with other parties in various states. But as far as Orissa is concerned, we have taken a conscious decision to support the Naveen government.        
	Naveen, already enjoying a mass support in the state, has a very important role to play at the national level too, he added.        
	Patel evaded the question as to how many seats his party was demanding in Orissa. That is immaterial. Whats important is that we have agreed to go together.         
	Sources, however, said the NCP had submitted a list of one Lok Sabha and 10 Assembly seats. NCP has two MLAs from Kendrapada and Balasore.        
	CPI and CPM state leaders also held seat-sharing talks with senior BJD leader and Rajya Sabha member Pyarimohan Mohapatra separately.        
	CPI state secretary Dibakar Nayak said the party had asked for one Lok Sabha and 15 Assembly seats.         
	His CPM counterpart Janardan Pati said he had asked for one Lok Sabha and 22 Assembly seats for his party.

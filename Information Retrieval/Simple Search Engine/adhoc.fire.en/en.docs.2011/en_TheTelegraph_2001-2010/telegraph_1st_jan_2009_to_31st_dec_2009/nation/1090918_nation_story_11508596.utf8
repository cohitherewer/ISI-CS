The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Land war brakes on projects
                                                                                                               Land war brakes on projects
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 17: Despite claims of rapid industrialisation made by the Naveen Patnaik government, the fact remains that eight of the 13 mega projects have virtually remained non-starter in the state. Reason: delay in acquiring land.        
	In the past five years, the government has signed more than 67 MoUs for establishment of steel, aluminium, power and cement plants. Out of these, 13 are proposed mega plants with a total investment of Rs 2 lakh crore. However, only Rs 21,031 crore  10 per cent of the total amount  have been invested so far, according to official figures.         
	The much-hyped 12MT Posco steel project, billed as the biggest FDI project, has made little progress. Only Rs 180.58 crore have been invested out of the total project cost of Rs 51,000 crore.         
	Of the total requirement of 6,000 acres, the government claims to have acquired 506.74 acres. However, the company is yet to take physical possession due to stiff resistance from residents.        
	The issue was raised by Posco representatives at a review meeting, chaired by industries and steel and mines minister Raghunath Mohanty today.        
	Mohanty admitted that the land acquisition issue was a cause of concern and advised Posco officials to go to the people and convince them of the benefits.         
	Two days ago, Posco chief executive officer Joon Yang Chung had announced that his company would set up a foundation at the project site that will take up social work. The objective: to win over local residents. It will be a win-win situation for both the people and Posco, the CEO had said, addressing reporters.        
	The fate of another mega steel plant is equally dismal. The ArcelorMittal project requires 8,000 acres, but, till now, does not have even an acre of land in Patna tehsil of Keonjhar district.        
	The industry minister, however, claims that the land acquisition process is in its advanced stage. So far, ArcelorMittal has invested Rs 25 crore as against the total project cost of Rs 40,000 crore.        
	The process of acquiring land for six more mega projects  a 6MT Essar plant, a 5MT Sterlite Iron and Steel Limited plant, a 3MT steel plant of Welspun Power and Steel, a 3MT steel mill of Uttam Galva Steel, a 1320MW plant of Jindal India Thermal Power and a 3MT steel plant of SSL Energy Limited  has made negligible progress.        
	Although Tata Steel has been allotted 3,040 acres out of its total requirement of 3,500 acres for a 6MT plant at Kalinga Nagar (Jajpur), it has not been able to take possession of a single acre due to law and order problems, said B.K. Singh, company vice-president for the state.         
	Possession of land and construction of a wall by Tata Steel was halted on January 2, 2006, after 13 tribals were killed in police firing during a protest.

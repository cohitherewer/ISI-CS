	New Delhi, May 17: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is expected to return to office with a younger team and new faces in the human resource development and, possibly, the railway and defence ministries.        
	Rahul Gandhis induction figured in a meeting between the Prime Minister and Congress president Sonia Gandhi today that drew up the broad guidelines for government formation.        
	Manmohan iterated his desire to include the Amethi MP, credited with the Congresss stunning resurgence in Uttar Pradesh, in his council of ministers. The rural development, agriculture, human resource development, youth and sports portfolios have been shortlisted, sources said.         
	Rahul, who has stressed his job is to revive the partys youth organisations as general secretary, is weighing his options.         
	Rail Bhavan could have Mamata Banerjee back at its helm, the sources said. The Congress has through informal channels received Mamatas cabinet wish list, which includes railways and food and civil supplies, and the initial response to it is positive.         
	The Congress is not keen on giving a berth to Lalu Prasad, whom it fought in Bihar.         
	P. Chidambaram is almost certain to retain home. There is a view that Pranab Mukherjee should be considered for finance but the Prime Minister is keen on his continuation as external affairs minister on the ground that he has done excellent work in foreign policy, sources said.        
	Manmohans first choice for finance is Montek Singh Ahluwalia, the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission. Congress sources said the Prime Minister believes Monteks clarity of vision and ideas make him the best man for the job of dealing with the current economic slowdown.         
	Kapil Sibal could get HRD in place of Arjun Singh, who is expected to get the axe for non-performance. Kamal Nath is tipped to continue as commerce and industry minister.        
	Minister for mines Sis Ram Ola, who at 81 is a couple of years older than Arjun, is unlikely to be inducted because of failing health.        
	But if Rajasthan loses a minister in Ola, it might gain one in 31-year-old Sachin Pilot. Jitin Prasada, Sandeep Dixit and Meenakshi Natarajan are the other young MPs who might get a berth.        
	The defence ministry could see a change of guard if A.K. Antony, who heads the Congress disciplinary committee and is seen as a good organisation man, is drafted for party work. The Rajya Sabha MP was the only minister from Kerala in the outgoing government, because the Congress had not won a single Lok Sabha seat there in 2004. This time, 13 Congress MPs have been elected, including ministerial hopefuls Shashi Tharoor and P.C. Chacko.        
	The DMK, with 18 seats, is bargaining for prize ministries like information technology and telecom, surface transport and company affairs. It is also eyeing junior berths in finance and home.        
	The NCP is looking to keep the agriculture and civil aviation ministries it holds.        
	The Samajwadi Party is trying to mend fences with the Congress, but is unlikely to make it to the government.         
	One offer the Congress could make Lalu Prasad is to give the Speakers post to RJD MP Raghuvansh Prasad Singh in return for his partys unconditional support to the government. Raghuvansh is popular in Parliament. Sonia is said to be fond of the Lok Sabha veteran with a gentle sense of humour and knowledge of parliamentary practices. Sushil Kumar Shindes name is also being considered for Speaker.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Stage set for battle of big guns
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Stage set for battle of big guns
          SUJAN DUTTA                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 23: The Indian Armys original heavy artillery gun supplier whose name became synonymous with defence scandals  Bofors  and a blacklisted Singaporean firm are set to face-off in a competition with a prize money worth more than Rs 10,000 crore after an embargo on trials for howitzers was lifted.        
	Defence ministry sources said here today that the government was acting on a recommendation from the chief of army staff, General Deepak Kapoor, to lift the embargo on Singaporean firm, ST Kinetics, and Israel Military Industries, also in the blacklist, to participate in competitions for five big Indian military orders.        
	In each of the five categories of military hardware that the army wants to procure fast there are two or more vendors.         
	The categories are: 155-mm towed guns, High Zone Bi-Modular Charge Systems (propellants for heavy artillery), armoured fighting vehicle tank protection systems, light strike vehicles for para-commando special forces, and light weight assault rifles.        
	But it is the armys Field Artillery Rationalisation Plan, under which it was standardising its big guns in the 155mm/52 calibre segment, that is the biggest draw for global armament makers. The Indian Army has not inducted a single heavy gun since 410 Bofors 22 years back during the Rajiv Gandhi regime.        
	The cloud over that deal after allegations of kickbacks extended over most military procurement plans and stalled equipment modernisation. The agreement with Bofors to upgrade and make indigenous big guns also expired in 2001.        
	Two earlier tenders were scrapped by A.K. Antony. Bofors, now owned by the US-division of BAe Land Systems is competing for the latest order  for the third time  with its Bofors FH 77 BO L52 gun-and-run howitzer. ST Kinetics is fielding its FH (field howitzer) 2000 gun for the competition.        
	ST Kinetics and Israel Military Industries were among seven companies blacklisted by Antonys defence ministry in June this year after investigators suspected former Ordnance Factory Board chairman, Sudipta Ghosh, of underhand deals. Ghosh was arrested in Calcutta in May.        
	Last month, the defence ministry amended rules to allow the companies to participate in trials and tests but not to conclude contracts before the CBI completes its probe. Ministry sources said the army chiefs request was vetted by the Central Vigilance Commission and the law ministry before the go-ahead to conduct the trials was given.        
	The army intends to buy 400 towed howitzers and make another 1,200 in collaboration with the foreign vendor. Under the Field Artillery Rationalisation Plan, it wants to procure 3600 heavy guns of 155mm/52 cal by 2020 of the towed, self-propelled/tracked and ultra-light varieties.

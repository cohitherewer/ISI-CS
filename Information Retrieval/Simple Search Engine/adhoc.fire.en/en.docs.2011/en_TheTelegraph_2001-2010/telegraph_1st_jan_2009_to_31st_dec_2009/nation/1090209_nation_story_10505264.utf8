          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Feb. 8: Timely police intervention today saved a youth from being burnt alive by the owners of the autorickshaw he has been driving for years.        
	The owners  Munna Das and Bachchu Das  apparently sprinkled kerosene on Aftab and tried to burn him alive in Khaje Kala area here on the charge that the latter had stolen the vehicle.        
	But the police acted promptly, rescuing the driver who was admitted later to Nalanda Medical College Hospital here with 40 per cent burns. Munna and Bachchu were also arrested.        
	According to some local people, the three-wheeler that Aftab was driving, disappeared about a couple of days ago. Aftab said that four passengers, who had hired the three-wheeler for going to Patna city area, drugged him before he fell unconscious and decamped with the vehicle.        
	I found myself lying on the streets when I gained senses. I do not know where the four people took the vehicle away, Aftab said from his hospital bed.        
	But the Das brothers, according to the police, summoned Aftab at their Khaje Kala home this morning and began questioning him. They charged that the driver, in connivance with vehicle lifters, had got the autorickshaw stolen and set the youth on fire after sprinkling kerosene on his body. Local people joined Aftab in raising alarm. The police from nearby Khaje Kala police station soon reached the spot and doused the flames.        
	Aftab is now out danger, said an attending doctor.         
	The police said that Munna and Bachchu  both in police custody  were undergoing interrogation.

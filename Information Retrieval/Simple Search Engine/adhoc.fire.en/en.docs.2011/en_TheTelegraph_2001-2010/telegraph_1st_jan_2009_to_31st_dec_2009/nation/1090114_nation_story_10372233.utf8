  - Coast Guard eye on boats          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Safety first: Fishermen in Puri get ready to go out fishing                                        
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 13: Fishing trawlers would be fitted with global positioning system (GPS) sets on the lines of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu to keep track of their movements along the vulnerable Orissa coast in the wake of the November 26 attack in Mumbai, where terrorists used the sea route.        
	Orissa has a 480km coastline, which is almost unguarded and thus vulnerable to terrorist attacks. Coast Guard officers, attending a meeting with state government officials recently, suggested GPS sets for fishing trawlers so that their movements could be monitored on the sea.        
	State government officials agreed to the suggestion and it was decided that the trawler owners would be asked to fit GPS sets. Home secretary A.P. Padhi said a GPS set was now costing Rs 4,000 to Rs 5,000. However, the price would be affordable after the low-cost products developed by the Bangalore-based Indian Space Research Organisation reach the market. The price would come around Rs 500, he said.        
	An estimated 9,200 fishing trawlers and boats are operating along the Orissa coast, which can be brought under surveillance through the GPS sets. Establishment of marine police stations on the Orissa coast also figured during the discussion. Out of five marine police stations sanctioned by the Centre, three were expected to be functional by March, said Padhi.        
	The proposed marine police station at Arjipalli in Ganajm district would be operational by the end of this month, the one at Paradip by middle of February and the third one at Balaramgadi in Balasore district by March-end. The police station at Paradip would operate from a rented building at the preliminary stage, he said.        
	Two more coastal police stations are proposed to be set up at Jambu in Kendrapara district and Dhamra in Bhadrak district. Setting up of marine police station at Jambu could not make progress because of non-availability of land. It was, therefore, decided that the matter would be sorted out in co-ordination with the forest department.        
	The Centre would provide one 5 tonne and two 12 tonne power boats to each of the marine police stations by April-end. In the first phase, 40 to 50 personnel would be recruited for each of the marine police stations and ultimately the staff strength would go up to 81.

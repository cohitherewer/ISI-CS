          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 11: Iron and steel industries in the Kalinga Nagar Industrial Complex in Jajpur are ruing the arbitrary and unequal rates of iron ore fixed by the Orissa Mining Corporation and have now threatened to shut down their units.        
	Even as governments across the globe are forking out bailout packages for industrial units reeling from recession, the Orissa government has done precious little to stem the rot and several steel units are now on the verge of closure because of retrograde policies pursued by the corporation, said Kalinga Nagar Industries Association president Purushottam Kandoi.        
	The corporation has arbitrarily fixed the price of iron ore pushing us to a blind alley, Kandoi said.        
	In fact, the corporation had been supplying iron and chrome ore at the highest quoted rates by quarterly tenders during the past three years till September 30 last year, he said.         
	But after the economic slowdown, the corporation fixed their own arbitrary and monopoly rate of iron ore at Rs 1,709 per tonne against the highest quoted tender rate of Rs 1,179 per tonne on November 11, he added. Similarly, the corporation declared a higher rate of Rs 10,350 per tonne for chrome ore as against the highest quoted tender rate of Rs 9,500, he added.        
	On December 28, the corporation again deviated in tenders and continued with its rate of iron ore at Rs 1,709 as against the highest tender rate of Rs 911. For chrome ore, it fixed Rs 4,869 against the highest tender rate of Rs 2,835, said Kandoi.        
	Stating that all industrial units in the Kalinga Nagar Industrial Complex have incurred heavy losses during the last quarter, the association said almost 25 per cent of capital had been eaten away because of the slowdown.         
	Moreover, if the corporation stuck to its present rate, no one would be able to survive the economic meltdown expected to last beyond next two years, said one of the members.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CBI strikes, CPM churns
                                                                                                               CBI strikes, CPM churns
          OUR BUREAU                          Vijayan                                  
	June 11: Pinarayi Vijayan, CPM politburo member, secretary of the Kerala unit  and now defendant No. 7.        
	The state that elected the worlds first communist government today witnessed an event unparalleled in the CPMs history: a politburo members name in a chargesheet in a corruption case.        
	But the CPM has far graver challenges ahead than updating its history. A rebellion is brewing within the Kerala unit of the party with some ministers allied with Vijayan informing the high command that they cannot work with chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan, who has publicly refused to condemn the governor for sanctioning the prosecution of the state CPM boss.        
	Prakash Karat, who is in Calcutta now to discuss why the party fared badly in the Lok Sabha polls, had been told last night by Kerala home minister Kodiyeri Balakrishnan that he and some colleagues could no longer work with Achuthanandan, sources said.        
	If a politburo meeting on June 19 fails to find a way out, matters could fast spiral out of control in a state that blazed a trail by electing a communist government in 1957 and had given as many as 19 MPs to the Left in 2004.        
	But before the theatre of war shifted to the CPM headquarters in Delhi, a legal flank was formally opened in Kerala with the CBI moving fast to file the chargesheet against Vijayan and eight others in a power deal case.        
	Three days after getting the governors nod for prosecution, the agency charged Vijayan, who was instrumental in awarding a contract worth Rs 390 crore to Canadian firm SNC Lavalin in 1997 when he was power minister, with cheating and conspiracy and under provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act.         
	The accused have been charged with flouting rules to award the contract to the foreign firm for the modernisation of three hydel plants, entailing a loss of Rs 86 crore to the exchequer. Vijayans name figures in the chargesheet as defendant No. 7. The charges carry a maximum punishment of seven years in prison.

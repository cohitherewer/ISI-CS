          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, July 30: Orissa police today busted a coal racket in Talcher zone (Angul) and arrested its kingpin.         
	According to the police, loaded trucks coming in from the storage yards of Mahanadi Coalfields Limited (MCL) would be looted and the coal sold in the black market near Choudhwar (Cuttack).        
	A team raided Handidhua colliery area of Talcher and arrested Debesh Sahu,the suspected kingpin, yesterday. A pistol and 23 rounds of ammunition were seized from his possession.         
	Ten lorries carrying coal from MCL storage yards on Talcher-Balramprasad road were intercepted by the police around midnight on Tuesday.         
	The magnitude of the racket clearly suggests that the racket thrived on the basis of fake transit passes and with help from private security guards deployed at MCL yards, said Pratik Mohanty, the Angul superintendent of police. So far 24 persons have been arrested and efforts are on to track the owners of the seized trucks, Mohanty said.         
	Police believe that the racket involving lakhs has been operating right under the nose of MCL authorities. The modus operandi is simple. Trucks enter the coal yards with fake transit passes and drain off coal loads in connivance with the yards personnel in charge where coal from mines are stored before transportation.         
	The stolen coal is secured in godowns by the mafia before release to the markets. Many a times they are supplied to factories that have mushroomed near Manguli Chakh in Choudwar region.

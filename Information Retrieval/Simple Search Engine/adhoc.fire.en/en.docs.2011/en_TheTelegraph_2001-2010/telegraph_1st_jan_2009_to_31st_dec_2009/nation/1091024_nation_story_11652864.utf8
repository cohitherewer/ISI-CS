          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 23: Move over babus; its time for professionals.        
	The culture ministry has adopted an IIT-like search-cum-selection method to fill the post of the director-general of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) instead of following the usual selection process, done through the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC).        
	The move marks a departure from the convention of having bureaucrats head top government institutions, and is being seen as the beginning of a process to get professionals in key departments. Ads have been put out for the post.        
	With the new process, we hope to get the most talented professionals to head important institutions, culture secretary Jawahar Sircar told The Telegraph.        
	Although there was stiff opposition from the department of personnel and training to discarding the UPSC selection process, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh intervened and backed the entry of professionals.        
	The Prime Minister was all for bringing in professionalism into the government machinery. His support helped us override all kinds of resistance, a ministry official said.        
	Under the new system, the search-cum-selection committee will be allowed to pick the best candidate even if the person hasnt applied. It is understood the department of personnel had criticised this particular provision the most, suggesting it would lead to nepotism and corruption.        
	All appointments (of professionals) will be made on contract basis and suitable candidates will be offered remuneration on a par with the best in the market, the official said.        
	He said candidates up to the age of 67 could apply for the ASI chiefs post and would remain in the job till they turned 70.        
	The new process will focus on professional achievements, not qualifications. If we follow the UPSC model, which goes strictly by qualifications, we will not get the best candidate. We have realised that from experience and decided to go by achievements, the official said.        
	The ministry plans to fill the remaining vacant posts the same way once the ASI gets a new chief.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Big-ticket copter call
                                                                                                               Big-ticket copter call
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Eurocopter Tiger, which is in the race for the IAF order                                   
	New Delhi, May 27: The defence establishment has opened a new season of procurements with the air force calling global aviation majors to bid for two helicopter orders worth more than $2 billion.         
	Air Chief Marshal Fali Homi Major today said the air force had invited tenders for 15 heavy-lift helicopters and 22 attack helicopters.        
	These are first big-ticket defence tenders to be issued after A.K. Antony began his second term in the defence ministry. While the tender for the heavy-lift helicopters is first, the one for the attack choppers is a re-bid because the defence ministry cancelled an earlier one issued in March last year.        
	What appeared to be an acquisition-holiday came to an end some time back and our modernisation programme with government support has gathered momentum, the air chief marshal said.        
	The requests for proposals for the heavy-lift helicopters have gone out to at least two  possibly three  manufacturers. Boeing with its Chinook twin-rotor chopper and Sikorsky with its Super Stallion are the likely principal contenders for the order. The Russian Mi-26 is a possible third contender.        
	But the new heavy-lift choppers are to replace the four Soviet-origin Mi-26 helicopters in service with the IAF currently. But the force has a tough time keeping the choppers flying. The heavy-lift choppers are needed to mainly transport men and materiel to high-altitude areas. The IAF can barely manage to keep two of the four Mi-26s serviceable because the supply of Russian spares is tardy, if at all.        
	The 22 attack helicopters that the IAF has invited bids for would replace the ageing Mi-35 helicopter gunships in the IAF, also of Soviet origin.         
	The contenders for the order are Boeing with the AH-64D Apache, Bell with its Super Cobra, Sikorsky with its Black Hawk, Eurocopter with its Tiger, Agusta Westland with its Mangusta, the Russian Kazan with its upgraded Mi-35. The order could be worth more than $1.2 billion.        
	Air Chief Marshal Major, who introduced his successor, Air Marshal P.V. Naik, said the induction of the helicopters would take about a year and a half. (Major demits office on May 31 when Naik takes over.) Air chief-designate Naiks main task will be to supervise the acquisition of the 126 medium multi-role combat aircraft.

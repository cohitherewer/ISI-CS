The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP vows to probe CBI
                                                                                                               BJP vows to probe CBI
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, April 28: The BJP today promised to set up a commission to investigate the CBI if it is voted to power, after Bofors accused Ottavio Quattrocchi was dropped from Interpols wanted list.        
	I hold Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress president Sonia Gandhi directly responsible for colluding in this conspiracy to bury the truth about Bofors, L.K. Advani, the BJPs candidate for Prime Minister, said.         
	Advani, as home minister and later deputy Prime Minister, had the opportunity to bring out the truth about Bofors when the BJP was in power at the Centre from 1998 to 2004. However, the CBI made little progress during those six years and no allegation of corruption has been proved.         
	BJP spokesperson Arun Jaitley alleged that the CBI  on whose advice Quattrocchis name was dropped from the Interpol list  had been reluctant to probe the case from the beginning. Jaitley was law minister during the BJP rule.        
	A commission headed by a Supreme Court judge will investigate the collusion of the CBI with the accused in several sensitive cases and suggest steps to institutionalise the independence of the CBI if the BJP comes to power, he said.        
	Jaitley mentioned cases against Satish Sharma, Shibu Soren, Lalu Prasad, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Mayavati in which he alleged that the CBIs conduct was dictated by political convenience.         
	Jaitley, however, did not clarify if the commission would probe the CBIs conduct only between 2004 and 2009 or also the years from 1998 to 2004 when the BJP was in power.         
	He described the decision as the governments farewell gift to the nation-in-law  a dig at Sonia Gandhis Italian origin.

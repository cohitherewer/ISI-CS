The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lobbying hits school panel
                                                                                                               Lobbying hits school panel
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 2: The national watchdog entrusted with cracking the whip to ensure the implementation of the proposed Right to Education Bill is itself limping at half strength because of political lobbying over posts.         
	The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) has only three members empowered to enquire into cases, instead of the seven required under law, despite repeated pleas for expansion over the past two years.         
	An understaffed panel is likely to struggle to tackle the cases of violation expected to pile up once the right to education becomes law.        
	New minister of state for women and child development (WCD) Krishna Tirath is preparing a list of possible members, dumping two previous lists of nominees  picked under her predecessor Renuka Chowdhury  officials told The Telegraph.         
	Chowdhurys first list, however, had to be discarded after it was discovered that one of the nominees had a criminal record. A second list was prepared over almost an entire year, with several aspirants jockeying for the posts.         
	This list was cleared by the Prime Ministers Office but the nominees could not be appointed because the Lok Sabha model code of conduct had been imposed and the Election Commission objected, sources said. The new list is far from finalisation, the officials said. The bill, passed by the Rajya Sabha, may get through in the Lok Sabha tomorrow, making it ready for implementing once notified.         
	The shortage of members on the NCPCR is now one of the biggest fears as far as implementing the proposed law is concerned. If the monitoring body is weak, punishing violations becomes hard, an official said.         
	Section 31 of the bill passed in the Rajya Sabha appoints the NCPCR  created after the Nithari killings  at the apex of Indias mechanism to monitor the implementation of the law.         
	The panel is tasked, under the proposed law, with enquiring into complaints relating to a childs right to free and compulsory education, and can recommend prosecution against those guilty of violations.         
	The NCPCR can review the safeguards in place for implementation of the law and suggest changes in rules.         
	But handling complaints of violation against the law aimed at empowering every child with education is unlikely to be an easy task even at full strength, an official said. At less than half strength, the task will be next to impossible, the official said.         
	The NCPCR act that governs the panel requires the commission to consist of a chairperson and six other members.

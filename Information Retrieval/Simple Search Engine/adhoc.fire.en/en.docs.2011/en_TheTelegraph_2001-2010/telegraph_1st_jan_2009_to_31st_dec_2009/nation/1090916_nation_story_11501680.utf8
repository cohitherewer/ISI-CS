The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bypoll wake-up jolt for Congress
                                                                                                               Bypoll wake-up jolt for Congress
  - Party pays price for complacency and over-dependence on national mascots         OUR BUREAU                                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 15: The string of by-election defeats has induced a sense of disquiet bordering on alarm in Congress circles with less than a month to go for key Assembly polls, though the party officially debunk suggestions of a setback or the need for corrections.         
	The UPA governments not entirely successful record in managing inflation and drought is only one  and perhaps not the most important  reason for the poor showing, party leaders insist in private.        
	More important causes, they say, are a sense of complacency that has gripped party functionaries following the victory in the general elections, the moribund state of the organisation in many states and the over-dependence on Sonia Gandhis and Rahuls charisma. Their appeal may work at the national level but cannot always deliver in disparate by-elections scattered across the country. In Gujarat, where the BJP wrested five Assembly seats from the Congress, there are also angry murmurs blaming Sonias powerful political secretary Ahmed Patel for poor and faction-inspired candidate selection.        
	Congress leaders discount the price factor, pointing out that the party won the Lok Sabha polls when prices were equally discomforting and the fears of economic slowdown were more intense.        
	The fact is though the consumer price index, which is based on the prices of goods at the retail level, rose more than three percentage points from 8.6 in May to 11.89 in July when the count was last taken, the trend of prices, especially of consumer perishables, indicates that there has been a further rise in the month and a half since then.         
	The manner in which Sonia has foregrounded and amplified the austerity imperative is perhaps indirect admission that prices and the drought-related crisis are substantive enough electoral issues and could damage the Congress and its allies in the coming polls.        
	Late monsoon rain has brought some relief on the drought front but economists have warned against drawing too much comfort because the initial dry spell prevented kharif crop from being sown in large parts of the country.        
	Congress leaders concede the failure to rekindle the party organisation at the state and district levels despite five years at the helm in Delhi. Neither has party managers been able to extract benefit from the disarray in the BJP.        
	Although the Congress is not attaching much significance to the recent defeats in Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand, the Gujarat outcome has surely rattled the high command. Among issues that have come to the fore are the partys inability to cash in on central welfare schemes and the complete dependence on Sonia Gandhi and Rahul to give the party an edge.        
	The Sonia-Rahul factor is a double-edged thing: while on the one hand it demonstrates the ability of the duo to tilt the balance, it also reflects the failure of the Congress to build a strong organisation and credible leadership in states.        
	Even during last months by-elections, the Congress had performed badly, losing all four seats that went to polls in Uttar Pradesh. Though it won two seats in Tamil Nadu, its performance in Karnataka  one in five  was nothing that inspires future confidence.        
	The message emanating from Gujarat now is that the presumption about the BJPs irredeemable decline is fallacious and the Congress needs to pull up its socks before the next round of Assembly polls.        
	The Congress might have dismissed the outcome of the Gujarat bypolls as insignificant, but it has shaken the leadership, which didnt want to let Narendra Modi off the hook at any cost. Many Congress workers admit that the 5-2 score was shocking and symptomatic of the partys failure in exploiting Modis declining popularity.        
	 These leaders, however, reject the view that the poor show was caused by rising prices and drought-like conditions. One Gujarat leader told The Telegraph: The BJP has lost a series of elections in the last four months and the price situation hasnt changed dramatically in this period. Modis boast of winning all the 26 Lok Sabha seats proved hollow. He pulled out all stops to win the Junagarh civic polls; announced a special package of Rs 600 crore and fielded five Muslim candidates, but lost. The BJP then lost important co-operatives, including Amul, despite all-out efforts and six more agro-produce associations.        
	Sources say the decision to field relatives of senior leaders in three constituencies wasnt received well by party workers. In Jasdan, which the Congress rarely lost in the last 50 years, sitting MLA Kunwarjibhai Bavaliya, managed a ticket for his daughter as he had been elected MP from Rajkot. The party cadres could not digest this family control and withdrew from active campaigning.        
	In Chotila, the party preferred the son of the sitting MLA Popat Jingaria whose death had caused the election. The Congress lost both the seats.        
	Another relative, son of sitting MLA Vitthalbhai Radadiya who got elected to the Lok Sabha, however, won the Dhoraji seat despite opposition from party workers. The Congress lost the Danta seat under the most bizarre circumstances. It fielded a Muslim candidate, prompting the BJP to ask voters if they wanted a Muslim on the board of the Ambaji temple trust.        
	The local MLA becomes the ex-officio member of the temple trust and the BJPs communal campaign worked. Congress leaders feel the party should have anticipated this and argue that the candidate was wrong as Danta was anyway a tribal-dominated seat.        
	In Sami, the Congress lost to itself. Congress MP Bhausinh Rathore defected to the BJP and unsuccessfully contested the Lok Sabha election. He then contested for the Assembly and won.         
	Another seat, Dehgam, is Shankersinh Vaghelas fiefdom. Vaghela is sulking as he is being slighted by the high command and he did not campaign. But for these manageable factors, the score would have read 6-1, despite the rising prices and weak party apparatus.        
	Sources say the Congress won Amul, Khera and Bhavnagar co-operatives primarily because the senior leaders stayed united. This unity was not reflected in the bypolls because the candidate selection was done by the central leadership, where Gujarat affairs are decided by none other than Ahmed Patel.        
	Congress leaders concede that Modis unlimited resources also played a role in the outcome. For instance, in one small constituency of Dehgan, Modi had deployed 25 MLAs and two MPs in addition to the huge party and state machinery.

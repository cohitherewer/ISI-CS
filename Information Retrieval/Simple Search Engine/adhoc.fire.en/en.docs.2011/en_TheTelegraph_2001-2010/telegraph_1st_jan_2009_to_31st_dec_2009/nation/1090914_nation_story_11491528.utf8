The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Farmers blame Trinamul in land letter 
                                                                                                               Farmers blame Trinamul in land letter 
          ZEESHAN JAWED                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 13: The farmers of Rajarhat are petitioning Mamata Banerjee  not to save them from CPM cadres  but to protect them from her own party supporters.         
	The farmers of Chabna mouza, the village in New Town that is resisting the installation of poles for high-tension wires, are writing to the Trinamul Congress chief complaining against local party leaders for terrorising and pressurising them in connivance with the CPM to give up their land.        
	The list of the accused will include both district and panchayat leaders. This is the first time that a written complaint against her own party leaders is being given to Mamata by villagers in New Town.         
	It would have not been that easy to acquire land for New Town had the Trinamul Congress stood by the people of Rajarhat. But the local-level leaders initially agitated to increase their bargaining power and later switched sides and helped the CPM to terrorise and pressurise the farmers to give up their land. They did not even participate in any programme organised to launch an agitation against land acquisition, said Rasheed Mondal, a resident of Chabna village, one among many villagers who do not want to give up their land.         
	If she really is a crusader for the cause of farmers, she should come and stand by the farmers of Rajarhat who have been handed peanuts for their fertile land by Hidco, Rasheed said.        
	In the letter, the villagers are naming Rajarhat block president Prabir Kar, Patharghata panchayat pradhan Ashok Nasker, Patharghata zonal leaders Ali Ahmed and Pulin Mondal and former MLA Tanmoy Mondal who was suspended by Trinamul last week for his suspected involvement in land deals.        
	Is suspension the correct punishment? We want accountability. Mamata should ask him what he has done and why he has done it. The amount of wealth he has amassed in the past six years should be brought to the public knowledge, Rasheed said.         
	The involvement of Trinamul leaders in land deals came into focus during the Vedic Village flare-up.        
	Citing an example, a few villagers narrated an incident that happened in April this year just before the Lok Sabha polls.         
	Panchayat pradhan Ashok Naskar has been trying to convince farmers to give up their land. He gave the green signal to the officials of Hidco to come and install the poles. But the villagers gheraoed the pradhan and he was forced to throw the first stone at Hidco officials, said 60-year-old villager, Khaled Molla.        
	Farmers associated with Trinamul in the Chabna mouza are also among the complainants. This matter has gone beyond the realms of party politics now. It is now the question of the farmers rights. We were left with no other option but to write to our leader to make her aware of the ground realities, said Iman Ali Mollah, a resident of Chabna. Iman Ali had contested the panchayat elections from seat number 14 of Patharghata gram panchayat, losing by seven votes.        
	Since I was involved in the land agitation, the local Trinamul leadership did not want me to win. The party workers were made to work for the Congress candidate to make me lose, Iman Ali alleged.        
	Chabna was acquired in 2004-2005 but the sale and transfers of land were suspended when New Town was conceptualised. Work has hit a hurdle as villagers are resisting installation of poles for high-tension wires to transmit power to the township.         
	A Trinamul general secretary said Mamata would look into the matter if she gets the letter from the villagers of Chabna. Let the letter come first, we shall decide what to do, he added.

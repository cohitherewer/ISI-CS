                                                                                                               Secular rebuke to Orissa   Protect Christians or quit, SC tells state
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                          Patnaik: Resign?                                        
	New Delhi, Jan. 5: The Supreme Court today said the Orissa government had better resign if it couldnt protect Christians in riot-scarred Kandhamal.         
	If the state government cant protect minorities, it has no right to rule and had better resign, a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan said.        
	The court asked the state to take a decision on withdrawing central paramilitary forces from the region in co-ordination with the Centre. We are a secular country we cannot allow prosecution of minorities, Balakrishnan added.        
	Todays observations followed a plea from Cuttacks archbishop for the communitys protection.        
	The archbishops counsel, Colin Gonsalves, drew the courts attention to recurrent bouts of violence and urged it to direct the Centre to keep the paramilitary forces longer in the state.         
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik had said last week that central forces would be taken off in stages from mid-January.        
	The forces were first deployed on the apex courts directive last October.         
	Violence had broken out after the killing of VHP leader Swami Laxmananda Saraswati last August. The VHP had blamed Christians for the killing, disregarding suggestions that Maoists might be involved.        
	The area has been simmering over reservation benefits that tribals who converted to Christianity have been demanding.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, July 20: For the past two days, visitors to the Konark Sun Temple (in picture) have been wading through knee-deep water.        
	Every monsoon the temple faces the same problem of water logging and with each year the situation worsens. Although the temple never got any drainage facility, rainwater would seep into the adjacent fields, thus saving the heritage site from water logging.         
	However, the fields have disappeared with concrete buildings and shops coming up in the area. There is less porous surface for the rainwater from Konark to drain out, explained district tourism officer Santosh Dash.        
	While the temple insides have a natural drainage facility, it does need to be repaired occasionally. This repair has already been included in the Rs 20-crore periphery development project to be jointly carried out by the Indian Oil Foundation and the ASI. Though the project was approved in 2001, work is yet to begin.         
	The foundation had handed over the project to a consultancy agency and the project blueprint is ready. Hopefully, work would begin from October 2009, said the tourism official.         
	However, the project does not include drainage of the area outside the temple. This is to be taken care of by the State water resources department.         
	The state government, however, has decided to spend money from the calamity relief fund to facilitate the work on the outside, said Dash         
	A meeting to this effect was held yesterday in which officials of water resources department were asked to co-ordinate with the Indian Oil Foundation and start work by October.         
	The problem is more acute on the northern side of the 13th century monument and Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has built a soak pit to absorb the excess water and eventually pump it out.        
	The monument was also in news recently as reports of dislocation of stones sparked off apprehension about its safety.

  - Mayhem in UP House: MLAs climb on seats and hurl missiles to protest bias        TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                          Opposition members protest in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly on the first day of the budget session. Picture by Naeem Ansari                                        
	Lucknow, Feb. 10: Lawmakers stood on their seats, rolled booklets into paper balls and threw them at the governor as the Opposition targeted T.V. Rajeswar for his politics of bias in another black day for the Uttar Pradesh Assembly.        
	The violence by Samajwadi Party members, to protest the states deteriorating law and order and the governors silence, brought back memories of an October mayhem 11 years ago when furious legislators had hurled microphones at each other, injuring several.        
	Sources said todays acrimony, which forced two adjournments, had a subtext, too: worsening relations between the Congress and the Samajwadi Party which have been stuck over sharing seats for the coming general elections.        
	The violence also came in the backdrop of a CBI goof-up in an assets case against Samajwadi chief Mulayam Singh Yadav which he fears could come in the way of its withdrawal from the Supreme Court where it has been pending since 2007.        
	The trouble began today minutes after Rajeswar had walked in to address a joint Assembly session. The Samajwadi members took out cloth festoons from their pockets and started waving them.        
	Rajeswar, however, settled down to read from his prepared speech.        
	A voice from the back cut him short. The people of UP are becoming poorer and (chief minister) Mayavati getting richer, a Samajwadi member shouted. Soon, the Opposition MLAs were on their seats rolling up Assembly booklets into paper balls. Then the missiles flew at the governor.        
	Rashtriya Lok Dal leader Kokab Hameed also joined the fray. He waved a black flag to protest against recent police firing on farmers as others raked up the murder of an engineer who had refused to contribute to an alleged donation drive for Mayavatis birthday.        
	Provoked by the Opposition attack, some legislators of the ruling BSP tried to shout them down. The Opposition MLAs answered with a volley of paper balls.        
	Three missiles came flying at the governor, who ducked, but some landed on his head. For the next two minutes, it was a free-for-all.        
	The protesting members went on hurling paper missiles and cloth festoons at Rajeswars table. At one time it seemed as if the House was heading for a repeat of October 21, 1997, when lawmakers had ripped microphones off desks to hit rival MLAs.        
	Go back governor, go back, the Samajwadi MLAs screamed as House marshals tried to ward off the paper balls.        
	Finally, around 11.05, the governor was escorted out, a symbolic Jai hind marking the end of his aborted speech.        
	Chief minister Mayavati sat through the din silently.        
	The BJP, which initially joined the anti-government tirade, walked out of the House, calling it a a political circus.        
	The Congress remained quiet.        
	Parliamentary affairs minister Lalji Verma said it was a black day for the Assembly.         
	But Mulayam said: I have never seen such a partisan governor. During my regime, he used... to send daily reports to Delhi. Now with Mayavati as chief minister, the states law and order has spun out of control, but he is keeping quiet.         
	He alleged that the Congress, too, seemed to be in the game.

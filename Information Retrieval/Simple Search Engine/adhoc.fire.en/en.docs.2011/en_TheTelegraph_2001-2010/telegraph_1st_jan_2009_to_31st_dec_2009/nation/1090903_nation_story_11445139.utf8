The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | In the search for CM, the Maoist spectre adds a menacing element
                                                                                                               In the search for CM, the Maoist spectre adds a menacing element
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                                            
	Hyderabad, Sept. 2: As the massive search operation failed to throw up any clues on the whereabouts of missing Andhra chief minister YS Rajasekhar Reddy, the spectre of Naxalites returned to haunt the state administration which claims to have snuffed out the guerrillas from their forest dens.         
	Aviation officials are expressing hope that the Bell 430 helicopter may have run into rough weather and landed in an inaccessible location inside the dense Nallamala forests, which has been the stronghold of the Maoist rebels.        
	Police sources said they were keeping fingers crossed because of the recent burst in Maoist activity along the Andhra-Chhattisgarh border, which is about 220km northwest of the site of disappearance of the helicopter.        
	National security adviser M.K. Narayanan, however, appeared to rule out any Maoist hand in YSRs disappearance and said the chopper may have gone missing because of to a technical snag or a pilot error.        
	Naxalite strike seems extremely improbable. I would almost entirely rule it out. I do not think the Naxalites have the capability to bring down the helicopter. That is the least of our worry, Narayanan said.        
	Although the chief ministers office and the state intelligence wing refused to confirm, CPI (Maoist) leader Mallojula Koteswar Rao alias Kishenji  the architect of the Lalgarh siege in Bengal  told a Telugu daily in a recent interview that we are not finished yet in Andhra Pradesh.         
	The CPI (Maoists) are miffed with Reddy because the chief minister, soon after taking over in his first term in 2004, had ditched them after initiating talks with Naxalite leaders who came all the way from Nallamala.         
	Next, Reddy authorised a crackdown on the Maoists. Led by director-general of police Swaranjit Sen, the force took a hard line approach and unleashed a massive operation in the Nallamala forests during 2005-06, forcing the Maoists to abandon their base and go on the run. The Maoist leaders shifted their base out of Andhra to safe houses in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu while the cadres fled to Chhattisgarh.         
	The Nallamala forest range spreads across 10 districts along the Krishna river with dense valleys and difficult hilly terrain. Nallamala is linked up in the north to the Dandakaranya jungles of Chhattisgarh and also down south to the Sheshagiri forest range of Tirupati leading to Tamil Nadu and Kerala.        
	Through the morning, the government kept giving out conflicting information.         
	The chief ministers office kept saying that defence helicopters had traced the missing chopper and YSR at Nalla Kaluva and Bhanumukkala villages near Kurnool.         
	Reports from a local channel owned by the chief ministers family also flashed that YSR spoke to his adviser and friend K.V.P. Ramachandra Rao on satellite phone.         
	However, all that changed by mid-afternoon when a grim-faced finance minister K. Rosaiah told reporters that the CM has not been located yet.        
	The government sought to justify the confusion on the ground that they did not want to jeopardise YSRs safety should the copter have been forced to land owing to inclement weather in the rebel-dominated jungles.         
	We did not want the Maoist elements who might be still operative in the region to get wind of it and plan something against his life, said a government spokesperson who refused to speak on record.         
	The spokesperson said it was because of this they had kept information on the helicopter and its likely place of landing or crash a secret till late afternoon.         
	Andhra politicians have often been the target of Maoists. Some years ago, Sudhir Kumar, the son of former Union minister P. Shivshankar, was abducted by the erstwhile Peoples War Group and let off after two weeks. State tribal welfare minister P. Balraj was kidnapped in Vishakhapatnam and released in exchange for the freedom of some jailed Maoist leaders.

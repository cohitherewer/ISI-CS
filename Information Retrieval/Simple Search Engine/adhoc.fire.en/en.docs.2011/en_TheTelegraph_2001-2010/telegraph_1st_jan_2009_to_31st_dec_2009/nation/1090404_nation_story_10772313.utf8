          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                          Lalu Prasad and Sanjay Dutt at the Samajwadi Party headquarters in Lucknow on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	Lucknow, April 3: The heartlands twin political show-stoppers today broke bread after a decade of intense animosity as they joined forces, not as any front but as part of the United Progressive Alliance.         
	Lalu Prasad and Mulayam Singh were joined by Ram Vilas Paswan as they shared the dais to take on the BJP and Mayavati, but studiously avoided mentioning the Congress in the same breath.         
	We are against a third front but we are not the fourth or fifth front. We are part of the UPA, said Lalu Prasad, leader of the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD). Sitting next to him, Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh added: We are here to fight Mayavati and BJP.         
	The seemingly improbable troika  Paswan of the Lok Janshakti Party had been a bitter opponent of Lalu Prasad in Bihar  said they would focus on fighting communal forces in the 134 seats across Uttar Pradesh (80), Bihar (40) and Jharkhand (14).        
	UPA will remain intact after the general elections. All alliance partners will support Manmohan Singh for the PMs post. UPA will form the government, Paswan said.        
	Lalu Prasad echoed his Bihar ally and pinned the blame on Congress munshis (managers) for the breakdown of seat-sharing talks. We are with Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh.         
	There are certain managers in the Congress who tried to create a rift between us during the seat-sharing discussions. However, we still say that Manmohan Singh will be our PM candidate, he said.        
	Mulayam Singh, whose partys talks with the Congress over an alliance have all but collapsed and who himself harbours ambitions of becoming Prime Minister, chose to remain silent as his friends backed Singh for the top job.        
	The support from Lalu and Paswan would have come as music to the Congresss ears on a day its vacillating ally Sharad Pawar skipped a rally organised by the Left parties and the Biju Janata Dal. Pawar said his Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) was not part of any third front and remained with the UPA.         
	Congress leader A.K. Antony today ruled out the party propping up a government formed by other groupings.         
	Amid the power play, it was the reconciliation of the Yadav twins  Lalu Prasad and Mulayam  that stole the show at Lucknow.        
	The two leaders closed ranks and appeared to have struck up a rapport that was reminiscent of their warm personal relations in the late eighties when both were part of the united Janata Dal.        
	We had fallen apart. Now we have come together. The poor have brought us back together, said Mulayam, who had gone to receive Lalu Prasad at Lucknows Amausi Airport. The two, joined by Paswan, then had lunch at Mulayams house on Vikramaditya Road.        
	As Lalu Prasad admitted later, it was Samajwadi general secretary Amar Singh who brought the two together.         
	In March 2007, the last time Lalu Prasad was in Lucknow, he had hurled political invective at the Samajwadi leader at a rally organised by the late V.P. Singh. He is a BJP sympathiser, the RJD leader had said of Mulayam, then the Uttar Pradesh chief minister.        
	In 2004, their relations had plumbed the depths when Lalu Prasad labelled Mulayam an agent of the BJP.

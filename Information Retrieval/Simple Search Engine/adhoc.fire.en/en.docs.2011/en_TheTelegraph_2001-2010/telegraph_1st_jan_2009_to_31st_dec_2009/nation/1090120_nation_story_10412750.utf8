	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 19: Several anti-displacement outfits today staged demonstration near the secretariat, demanding cancellation of Posco steel plant and Vedanta university projects.        
	Hundreds of activists of Navnirman Samiti, Bhartiya Kisan Mazdoor Union, Vedanta Viswavidyalaya Sangharsha Samiti and Rashtriya Yuva Sangathan took out a rally shouting slogans Posco go back and Vedanta go back and marched towards the secretariat. However, they were prevented by the police from marching further.        
	The protesters threatened to intensify their agitation if the two projects were not scrapped immediately. Navnirman Samiti president Akshay Kumar alleged that the Naveen Patnaik government was promoting the interest of MNCs, while displacing thousands of farmers from fertile agricultural land.        
	While the government was handing over fertile agricultural land and valuable mines to the MNCs at throwaway price, it was not taking any tangible step for the development of agriculture and agro-processing industries, said Bharatiya Kisan Mazdoor Union president Iswar Chandra Tripathy.        
	Prasant Paikray, the leader of Posco Pratirodh Sangram Samiti, which has been spearheading agitation against the proposed mega steel plant near Paradip by South Korean steel giant Posco, said the project would spell disaster for the local agro-based economy. Local villagers, who eke out a living through cultivation of paddy, betel nut and prawn, would lose livelihood, he said.        
	If anybody leads peaceful and democratic movement against the mega industrial projects coming up on fertile agricultural land, the state police book him on false and fabricated charges, said Paikray, citing the arrest of Posco Pratirodh Sangram Samiti president Abhay Sahu on October 13 last year.        
	The demonstrators also demanded immediate and unconditional release of Sahu.

                                                                                                               Cong counts secular gains
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Moily                                  
	New Delhi, March 28: The Congress watched with trepidation Varun Gandhis surrender drama and the BJPs determination to make the most of his hate speech controversy, but also spied a silver lining.        
	The more the BJP raises the communal temperature, the more it will be incumbent on all secular forces to drop their differences and come together to face the challenge. The message is for the Left and their allies, a general secretary said.        
	That Lalu Prasad, Ram Vilas Paswan, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Anbumani Ramadoss  allies who will fight the elections independent of the Congress  continued to support Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh proved they were committed to the secular cause and unlikely to do business with the BJP after the elections, sources said.        
	The Congress also dared the Janata Dal (United) to pull out of the NDA if it believed the Varun episode undermined its secular position.         
	Nitish Kumar and Sharad Yadav are also competing for the secular space. But their stand is suspect. They must break off with the BJP, Congress spokesperson M. Veerappa Moily said.        
	While Moily claimed the BJPs communal card had lost its currency  he pointed to its defeat in the Rajasthan and Delhi elections immediately after 26/11  but heartland leaders said it was hard to predict how the strategy to communalise the polity would play out.        
	In the recent elections, the BJP used it but was unsuccessful. This time we saw its cadres come out on the streets when Varun courted arrest. If the workers are ignited weeks before an election, it shows the strategy is partially successful, a source said.        
	The Congresss stakes in Uttar Pradesh are limited to holding on to its nine seats, but sources said if the Hindutva card worked for the BJP, minority votes might consolidate behind either the Samajwadi Party or the BSP, whichever appears better poised to defeat the BJP in a seat. If the Samajwadi gains, the better for us because they are still inclined towards the Congress, a source said.

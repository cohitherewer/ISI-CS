The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Too late, insulted ally tells Singh
                                                                                                               Too late, insulted ally tells Singh
          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                       Manmohan, Mulayam (below)                                
	Lucknow, April 11: Mulayam Singh Yadav today released his election manifesto with an attack on the Prime Minister, saying if Manmohan Singh felt it was a bad decision not to ally with the Samajwadi Party he should have thought about it earlier.        
	Why has this issue crossed the Prime Ministers mind at this time, the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister said, adding that it was too late to do anything about it now.        
	He should have thought over it earlier at an appropriate time.        
	The comment came in response to Singhs statement yesterday when he said it would have been a lot better had the Congress and the Samajwadi Party fought the coming polls as allies.        
	Mulayam said his 39-MP party was overlooked and insulted though it had stepped in at a time the Prime Minister might have resigned. We saved the government, he said, alluding to the 60-MP-strong Lefts withdrawal of support over the nuclear deal last year and the trust vote that followed.        
	But look how we were treated, what we got in response. We were not only overlooked, but were also insulted.        
	Singh had yesterday said he would have resigned had the Indo-US civil nuclear deal not gone through.        
	Although the Samajwadi Party has entered into a tie-up with the RJD and the LJP, it launched its party manifesto without the presence of its allies.        
	The party vowed to bring back black money stashed abroad by Indians and seize all unaccounted cash and use it for the countrys development if it was voted to power.        
	If the SP comes to power at the Centre, it will bring all the countrys black money from other parts of the world, Mulayam said.         
	The promise drew sharp comments from Mulayams critics. Uttar Pradesh Congress spokesman Akhilesh Pratap Singh said it was foolish to suggest that the government should seize disproportionate income from people without a trial.        
	One has to prove in court that excess property indeed exists before seizing it. What would Mulayam Singh Yadav have felt had the central government seized his alleged disproportionate income before registering the (assets) case (against him)?        
	The Supreme Court had, acting on a public interest litigation, directed the CBI to conduct a preliminary probe into allegations that Mulayam and his family had amassed assets disproportionate to their known sources of income.         
	The 16-page manifesto dedicated two-and-a-half pages to the economic downturn and suggested promotion of cottage industries to battle the meltdown.         
	The manifesto also objected to further division of Uttar Pradesh. Such division only creates problems in law and order and administrative decisions, Mulayam said.         
	Like last time, the party vowed to change the name of India to Bharat and focused on minorities and marginalised sections. This time, it added to its agenda abolition of expensive English-medium schools as they cause social disparity, and promotion of local languages. The party said it would support Tibets independence and condemned Chinas claim on Arunachal Pradesh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Former adviser meets PM
                                                                                                               Former adviser meets PM
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, June 2: Sanjaya Baru, former media adviser to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, called on his former boss today, setting off a light flutter in the power corridors.         
	There was no official word on the purpose or content of the meeting, though PMO sources did confirm it took place.         
	There was speculation in some circles about Baru returning to a new assignment under Singh, but it was entirely unsupported by any affirmation. Baru himself was unavailable for comment.         
	Baru, a senior career journalist who often doubled as the Prime Ministers speech writer, especially on economic issues, had left the job last August to take up a teaching assignment at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in the Singapore World University.         
	His decision to depart eight months before the end of Singhs first term in office was described as entirely personal, brought on by the fact of his daughter finding a placement in the Lasalle School of Art in Singapore.                     
	The media advisers job remained vacant for four months before being filled in by Deepak Sandhu, the Government of Indias principal information officer (PIO).         
	She held dual charge as PIO and spokesperson for the Prime Minister for a while before formally being appointed media adviser.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Trust vote with new allies
                                                                                                               Trust vote with new allies
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 8: Naveen Patnaik today paraded new friends from the UPA and the Left before the Orissa governor but was asked to face a trust vote on Wednesday despite his apparent majority.        
	UPA partners Jharkhand Mukti Morcha and Nationalist Congress Party, as well as the CPM and the CPI, claim to have thrown their weight behind the chief minister, who walked out of his coalition with the BJP yesterday.        
	Patnaik, who needs 74 votes in the House of 147, paraded 75 MLAs before governor M.C. Bhandare and handed him a letter of support with 75 signatures, said sources in the chief ministers party, the Biju Janata Dal. But Bhandare insisted on a floor test.        
	A trust vote is more or less pointless now since Orissa will hold Assembly elections side by side with the Lok Sabha polls that begin next month. However, staying in power during elections holds some advantages.        
	The MLAs who accompanied the chief minister to Raj Bhavan included 59 from the BJD, four from the JMM, two from the NCP, one each from the CPI and the CPM and seven Independents besides BJP MLA Dhaneswar Majhi who recently quit the party.        
	A PTI report said two BJD members, Speaker Kishore Mohanty and former minister Debashish Naik, did not join Patnaik at Raj Bhavan.         
	More than 74 signatories were present before the governor. But the governor told us that the vote of confidence will take place on the floor of the Assembly on March 11, Patnaik told reporters.

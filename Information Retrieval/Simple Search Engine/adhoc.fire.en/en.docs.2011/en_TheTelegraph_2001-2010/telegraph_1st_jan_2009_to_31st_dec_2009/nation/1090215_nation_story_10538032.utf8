The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Monday hope amid train torture

	Calcutta, Feb. 14: A series of trains to Orissa and south India were cancelled today, with officials saying the situation might improve from Monday.        
	The cancellations frustrated hundreds of passengers, who included many travelling south for treatment, and led to long queues for refund.        
	Tomorrows Howrah-Bhubaneswar Dhauli Express has already been called off.        
	Passengers travelling to south India or Orissa tomorrow can call our toll-free number (10722) for assistance, a railway official said.         
	Among the trains cancelled today were the Howrah-Chennai Coromandel Express, Dhauli Express, Howrah-Secunderabad Falaknuma Express, Howrah-Bhubaneswar Janshatabdi Express, Howrah-Yeshwantpur Express, Howrah-Puri Sri Jagannath Express and the Howrah-Puri Passenger.        
	A few other south-bound trains were diverted through alternative routes, bypassing Jajpur in Orissa where the Coromandel Express had jumped tracks last night.        
	If we can get even a single line, well try and run some of the trains tomorrow, the official said. But these are likely to run behind schedule.         
	A special train left Jajpur at 5.10am, carrying passengers of the derailed train to Chennai.

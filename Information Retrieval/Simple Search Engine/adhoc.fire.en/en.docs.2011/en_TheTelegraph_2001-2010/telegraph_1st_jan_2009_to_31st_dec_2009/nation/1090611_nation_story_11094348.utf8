The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Word tag eludes Jai Ho
                                                                                                               Word tag eludes Jai Ho
                            
	Houston, June 10 (PTI): Subhash Ghai would be disappointed his brainchild couldnt make it to the English dictionary.        
	Jai Ho, which he had suggested to A.R. Rahman for inclusion in a song, failed to make it as the millionth word or phrase in the English language. Nor did slumdog, the other Indian word vying for the slot, a US-based language monitoring group said today.         
	Both lost out to web 2.0, a tech jargon that was found to be more popular.        
	The Global Language Monitor, a group of academics based in Austin, Texas, who have been tracking the birth of new words in English, announced that Web 2.0 had bested Jai Ho, N00b and slumdog. Jai Ho finished at the second spot and slumdog at the fourth.        
	Web 2.0 is a technical term meaning the next generation of worldwide Web products and services. It has crossed from technical jargon into far wider circulation in the past six months.

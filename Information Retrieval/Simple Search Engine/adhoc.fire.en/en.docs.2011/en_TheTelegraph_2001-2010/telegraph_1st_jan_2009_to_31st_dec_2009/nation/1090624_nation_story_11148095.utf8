          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, June 23: The nun, who was gangraped during the Kandhamal violence on August 25 last year, identified one more person at Choudwar jail today.        
	At least 70 prisoners, including seven suspects in the crime, took part in the test identification (TI) parade.        
	The 29-year-old Catholic nun had earlier identified two of the 10 accused at a TI parade inside Choudwar Central Jail on January 5. Today, the victim identified, one person Sitaram Patra (36), who had raped her, jail superintendent Dharanidhar Das said.         
	A second TI parade had become imperative as seven more accused had been further arrested. Father Thomas Chellan, the prime witness, was called but could not identify anyone (as in the first TI parade).         
	He apparently walked in front of them twice, looking at each face carefully, but shook his head after over half an hour. Seven of the 17 accused arrested on suspicion of being involved in the rape were brought to the TI parade at the jail, 11km from here.         
	First class (rural) judicial magistrate, Cuttack, who conducted the parade, also included 63 jail inmates, the sources said.        
	The Baliguda SDJM had ordered for the second TI parade after the crime branch, probing into the sensational rape case, moved the court for a TI parade of one of the prime accused in the case along with six others who had been arrested after January 5.        
	The TI parade was held here following directions of the high court on a petition filed by the nun.         
	She had requested the high court for shifting the venue for the TI parade from Baliguda sub-jail on the plea that she did not feel safe travelling to the district.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | RSS hint at softer stand on gays
                                                                                                               RSS hint at softer stand on gays
          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, July 11: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh may be considering a more tolerant stand on homosexuality compared with those Hindu religious leaders who have condemned the recent Delhi High Court judgment outright.        
	In the latest issue of Sangh mouthpiece Organiser, S. Gurumurthy, a member of the Sangh think tank, says that tolerance for deviant behaviour is part of the Indian ethos.        
	His article objects to the shameless debate on the subject following the court verdict, and argues that traditional Indian society had wisely ignored deviants rather than punish them. The court verdict, it says, tries to do the same by demolishing a legal framework that punished homosexuals.        
	The high court has ruled that sex in private between consenting adults cannot be deemed criminal, thus legalising gay sex and all other forms of non-conventional sexual acts.        
	Sangh parivar outfits like the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and several Hindu religious leaders have, however, described the verdict as an assault on Indian culture and joined Muslim and Christian clerics in criticising it.        
	Yoga guru Baba Ramdev, who has been part of various socio-religious campaigns by the VHP, is said to be planning to move the Supreme Court against the judgment. There has even been talk about leaders from the various faiths filing a joint appeal in the apex court.        
	Gurumurthy, however, quotes historians and religious texts to argue that unlike Christians and Muslims, the Indian tradition in the pre-colonial era did not punish or despise gays. It regarded them as a marginal fact of life not even worth discussing.        
	According to his article, Indian society was built not around state laws but around social and family norms that were not forcibly applied. Indian civilisation recognised diversity in behaviour and morals, and never imposed one rule on all.        
	Gurumurthy cites how polygamy was, and is, prevalent in Indian society although it has accepted monogamy as the norm. He says Ram, who had one wife, and his father Dasrath, who had many, are both worshipped while Sita and Meera, different in terms of family values, are both considered great women.        
	The article, however, cannot be taken as expressing the official position of the Sangh, which may still decide to swim with the tide and oppose gay rights in the name of Indian culture.

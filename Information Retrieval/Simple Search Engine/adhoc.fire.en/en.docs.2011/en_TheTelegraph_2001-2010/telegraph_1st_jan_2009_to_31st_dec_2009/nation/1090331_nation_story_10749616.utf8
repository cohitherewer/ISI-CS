The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Govt clears decks for PSU pay boost
                                                                                                               Govt clears decks for PSU pay boost
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 30: The Centre today cleared a salary revision that could translate into hikes of up to 20 per cent for PSU executives in addition to what a pay panel had recommended.        
	The increases had been expected since January this year, when officials of oil companies went on strike against the panels suggested increases, saying they werent enough.         
	The protest had left fuel pumps dry and threatened to snowball into a transport crisis before the Centre cracked down on the recalcitrant officials. It had also promised to look into the demands for more pay.        
	A cabinet meeting headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh announced the pay revision after it was cleared by the Election Commission, which asked the government not to publicise the move to keep the ruling UPA from using the bonanza as a campaign issue.         
	Much of the 20 per cent hike will come from a tweak in the pay structure of the executives that will see 78.2 per cent of their dearness allowance (DA) merged with basic pay compared with the 68.8 per cent proposed by the panel and announced last November.        
	Combining a higher proportion of the DA with the basic pay pushes up the amount on which various allowances, such as HRA and retirement benefits, are calculated. This leads to an increase in total allowances.        
	Giving an example, an official said a basic salary of Rs 100 would now translate into Rs 370.48 (with allowances) against Rs 351.12 last year. The figure leaves out superannuation benefits which, if added, would take the emoluments to Rs 532.65 against Rs 504.70.         
	Retirement benefits are usually kept out of some pay calculations as they are not paid each month but held back till the end of service.         
	The increased DA merger will be effective from last November. The revised pay recommended by the panel is to be effective from January 2007.        
	Todays DA rejig and the revised pay have to be cleared by the boards of individual companies before the officials get the raise.        
	The officials were guarded in their reaction to the move, aware perhaps that the board approvals had to come through and a government notification had to be issued. This (the increase) has to be calculated and it is difficult as the government has as yet not put up a notification on this, an official said.        
	Home minister P. Chidambaram, who briefed reporters on the cabinet decision, left some doubts about the exact gains when he said they would depend on the state-owned companies performance and profitability. Chidambaram headed the panel the Prime Minister had constituted this January to look into the issues raised by the striking officials of the oil companies.        
	Former Supreme Court Justice M. Jagannadha Rao, who headed the PSU pay-revision panel, had submitted his report last May and observed that the compensation should be fixed independent of government servants salaries.         
	The panel had recommended that performance-related pay be made an integral part of the PSU salary package, as was the case in private firms.         
	This component should be directly linked to the profits of the PSUs and performance of the executives, the panel had said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Varun knocks on RSS door
                                                                                                               Varun knocks on RSS door
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Lucknow/New Delhi, June 24: Fried by his party, Varun Gandhi today appealed for direction  from the parent.        
	The 29-year-old, who came under attack at the BJP national executive for his alleged hate speech, visited the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sanghs heartland headquarters where he is believed to have sought a clarification on whether the comments had gone against the concept of Hindutva.        
	A source at the RSS office here said Varuns discussion with Ashoke Beri, the chief of RSS pracharaks in the state, and other Sangh leaders lasted an hour during which he clarified his position on the Pilibhit hate speech and sought their direction.        
	He was asked to read more on cultural nationalism and inclusive Hindutva, the source added.         
	The visit came amid speculation that the young Gandhi might eventually be put in charge of party affairs in Uttar Pradesh. Varun sought opinions from RSS leaders on his plan for the revival of the BJP in the state, a BJP leader said.        
	The meeting between the Pilibhit MP  whose alleged threat to cut off the hand that dared to attack Hindus was blamed for the BJPs heartland debacle  and the Sangh leaders came a day after RSS chief Mohanrao Bhagwat explained his view of Hindutva.        
	To call one a Hindu, one need not leave anything  neither religion nor identity. Hindutva says all can live together. It is tolerant and accommodative, Bhagwat told a seminar at Jammu University.        
	Although the RSS had backed Varun immediately after his speech set off a controversy, sources said it was forced to revisit its stand after the Lok Sabha verdict.

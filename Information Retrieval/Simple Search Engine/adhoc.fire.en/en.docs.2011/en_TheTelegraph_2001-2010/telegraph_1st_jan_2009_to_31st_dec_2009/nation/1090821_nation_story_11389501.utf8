                                                                                                               SMS to VC lands college girl in jail
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Raipur, Aug. 20: A plea for re-evaluation of her exam papers may have been ignored, but signing off an SMS to the varsity vice-chancellor with a lal salam (red salute) landed a college girl in jail in Maoist-hit Chhattisgarh.        
	Archana Goswami had sent an SMS to Bilaspur- based Guru Ghasidas Universitys vice-chancellor (VC) Laxman Chaturvedi on August 4.         
	A second-year student of Bachelor of Science, Archana failed in her examination and applied for re-evaluation. She urged the VC to let her pass.         
	The message sent by the girl ended with lal salam (a phrase commonly used by Maoists) and seemed as if the sender was hinting at her Naxalite links, said Bilaspur police cyber crime cell in-charge Prabhakar Tiwari.         
	The police team probed the matter following a complaint lodged by the VC and traced the girls address on the basis of the mobile used to send the SMS. Archana was arrested yesterday night from her Ambikapur residence in Sarguja district  about 100km north of Bilaspur.         
	She studied in a government college of Ambikapur affiliated to the varsity.         
	During interrogation, the girl has confessed that she sent the message but did not state why she ended with Lal Salam, Tiwari said. The police are investigating whether she has any Maoist links.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Half-filled ground at   Sonia rally
                                                                                                               Half-filled ground at   Sonia rally
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, April 29: Sonia Gandhi today addressed the Congresss first high-profile rally in Delhi, but the half-empty Ramlila Grounds left the party hoping the turnout wasnt a pointer to its poll fortunes.        
	Delhi Congress leaders delayed Sonias arrival at the venue by over an hour but the grounds refused to fill up. Finally, they blamed it on the sizzling 43 Centigrade.        
	The party, however, brought Jagdish Tytler and Sajjan Kumar on the dais when Sonia introduced the seven candidates in the fray. Tickets given to the duo had been withdrawn after a shoe was flung at P. Chidambaram in anger at their acquittal in the 1984 riots.        
	Sonias speech was all about development. She touched on people-friendly schemes initiated by the UPA, such as the rural job guarantee plan, and talked at length about initiatives in the field of education.

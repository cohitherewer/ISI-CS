The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Soft Karat causes BJP heartburn
                                                                                                               Soft Karat causes BJP heartburn
          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, May 14: The BJP is aghast at Prakash Karats hint about supporting a Congress-led government, fearing this would hand the advantage to the Congress in the government-formation stakes.        
	Party leaders said they always knew the Left would eventually join the efforts to block the BJP, but had presumed that Karat was too rigid a man to yield so easily.        
	The BJP had expected the CPM general secretary to continue to pursue his goal of a non-BJP, non-Congress government for now.         
	Karat, however, indicated in a newspaper interview today that if the Congress did not agree to support a third front government, he would not let the BJP exploit the situation.        
	Most BJP leaders believe that the NDA would have been better placed to secure a majority without the Lefts somersault. They poured scorn on Karat for throwing in the towel even before the results were out.        
	The (Lefts) opposition to the Congress was a farce, BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said.         
	We are amused by the brinkmanship of the greatest warrior of the third front. Despite showing a pathological hatred for the Congress, he is now saying the Left would support the Congress.        
	He hoped the President would go by well-established precedents and call the largest pre-poll alliance to form the government. Prasad recalled how Rajiv Gandhi, P.V. Narasimha Rao and Atal Bihari Vajpayee had been invited to form the government despite being short of majority.         
	However, these leaders were invited because they headed the single largest party at the time. The President is allowed by the Constitution to invite whoever she believes can form a stable government.        
	The BJPs core committee met at L.K. Advanis residence several times to analyse the exit polls and the inputs from in-house psephologist G.V.L. Narasimha Rao. Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi, who was present at the meetings, asked the party not to be perturbed by exit poll predictions of a thin UPA majority.        
	The leaders also worked out future strategies, including a mechanism for consultation with prospective allies. The presence of Chennai-based ideologue S. Gurumurthy underlined that Jayalalithaa was an important target.        
	Party president Rajnath Singh has briefed the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh on the possible post-poll combinations and permutations.

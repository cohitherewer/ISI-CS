                                                                                                               BJP seeks minister head in rape case
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Juel Oram: BJP fury                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 3: The Opposition BJP today demanded the dismissal and resignation of SC and ST development minister Bijoy Ranjan Singh Bariha, for allegedly shielding a prime accused in the gangrape of a Dalit girl at Paikmal in Bargarh district.         
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik who professes to be transparent in all his businesses should drop the minister or ask him to resign to make the investigation free and fair, said BJP national vice-president and former Union minister, Juel Oram today.         
	Oram, who was a part of the BJP delegation that visited Bukhamunda village on Saturday to talk to the victim, alleged that her family was being threatened by the ministers supporters.         
	Even the minister, who visited the family earlier, had allegedly tried to stop her from pressing charges and had promised land and job, the BJP leader quoted the girl as saying. Incidentally, the main accused is Mahesh Agrawal, a local BJD leader and a close aide of Bariha.         
	The police are yet to arrest Agrawal and co-accused even as the high court has rejected his anticipatory bail petition, since he enjoys the support of Bariha, alleged Oram. Another accused, Kunal Singh Bariha, who happens to be the nephew of Bariha is moving scot-free, Oram added.         
	The culprits are at large even after a lapse of three months, rued the BJP national secretary and former MP, Dharmendra Pradhan         
	The alleged rape involves a 24-year-old Dalit girl, who lives in Bhukhamunda village within Paikmal police station limits in Bargarh.         
	She had reportedly gone to Paikmal block office on May 10 to meet chairman Mahesh Agrawal, seeking employment as an anganwadi worker for which she had applied earlier. Agarwal allegedly sent her to meet Gananidhi Nag, who then took her to a godown, owned by Sajan Agrawal, where she was raped by more than three persons, including Gananidhi and Sajan.         
	Later they threatened to kill her if she told anyone about the incident.         
	Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik has ordered a probe by the crime branch after a public uproar began in the case.         
	But, the Opposition has been demanding a CBI probe apprehending that the crime branch would not be impartial since ruling party leaders were allegedly involved in the crime.

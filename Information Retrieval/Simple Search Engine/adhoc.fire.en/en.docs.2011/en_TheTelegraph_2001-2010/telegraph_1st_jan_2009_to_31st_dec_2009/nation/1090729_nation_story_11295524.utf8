The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Job scheme to build assets
                                                                                                               Job scheme to build assets
          CITHARA PAUL                                            
	New Delhi, July 28: The rural job scheme will no longer be about digging pits and filling potholes here and there, often without much purpose, just so the village poor can be paid somehow.        
	It will now build assets for the country  such as rural hospitals, schools, bridges and irrigation canals  so it can become an overall driver of the rural economy, officials say.        
	For instance, some 230,447km of rural roads will be built by 2012 under the scheme, says a draft policy on its expansion being finalised by the rural development ministry. The target till next March is 46,000km of roads.        
	The expanded National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) is expected to be unveiled on August 20, the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.        
	The NREGS will no longer be a plain job guarantee scheme where projects are created just to find 100 days job a year for the poor. We will focus on creating permanent assets, a rural development ministry official said.        
	The new policy seeks a convergence of the scheme with development programmes run by other ministries such as those for health, water resources, education, forests and environment, and agriculture.        
	Building a hospital or school will not only help the National Rural Health Mission and education programmes, it will also save the health and education ministries money on wages. The convergence experiment which may also include afforestation and fishery work  will be carried out initially in 115 select districts.        
	The scheme now mostly involves odd jobs such as repairing roads, building temporary check dams and digging pits. Various social auditing teams that have visited NREGS sites have complained that thousands of pits were being dug across the country without any utility or purpose.        
	The main problem has been the lack of enough co-ordination between the Centre and the states at the district level in conceiving projects. So, a lot of money has gone into projects that are of not much use. From now on, there will be more co-ordination, the official said.        
	If assets are to be built, NREGS jobs will need skilled workers more than ever. The new policy plans to induct semi-skilled and skilled workers if they are willing.        
	One other feature is imparting skill training. The job schemes beneficiaries will now be trained to weave, care for children, the sick and the elderly, maintain school buildings and public toilets, even to help anganwadi workers. The related ministries will provide the training.        
	The draft policy also wants to involve more small and marginal farmers, who make up about 85 per cent of Indias agricultural community.        
	One suggestion the rural development ministry is apprehensive about accepting is that the beneficiaries be allowed to work as labourers on paddy fields where there is a shortage of workforce.         
	The problem is, the paddy fields would mostly be in private hands. It is a touchy subject since many will oppose government money flowing into private hands through the scheme, the official said, adding this could open the way for abuse of the scheme.        
	The official said funds would not be a problem for any project under the scheme: the rural development ministry had received a 144 per cent hike in its budget.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 12: A month after the Naveen Patnaik government announced 36 per cent salary hike for government officials involving an additional financial burden of Rs 2,255 crore, it today decided to double the retainer and daily fees of government lawyers, apparently to please them ahead of coming elections.        
	Last month, the cabinet had approved the hefty pay revision of government employees with effect from January 1, 2006. The highest amount of pay rise was to the tune of Rs 9,000 per month and the lowest Rs 4,000.        
	Today, the government decided to revise the fees of government lawyers, starting from the post of public prosecutors and additional public prosecutors at district levels up to the top-most post of advocate-general at the high court. Sources in the state law department said the revision was due since the past eight years.        
	The monthly retainer fee of the advocate-general would be doubled to Rs 10,000, while his daily fee would be revised from Rs 800 to Rs 1,600. Similarly, the retainer fee and daily fee of government advocates, additional government advocates, standing counsels and additional standing counsels working at the high court would be double fold.        
	The retainer fees of government advocate would be doubled to Rs 6,000, while that of additional government advocate and standing counsel would be hiked to Rs 5,000 from the existing rate of Rs 2,500, while that of additional standing counsels would be doubled to Rs 4,000 per month.        
	Similarly, the government advocate working at the Orissa Administrative Tribunal and Central Administrative Tribunal would get a revised retainer fee of Rs 6,000 per month as against the prevailing rate of Rs 3,000. The monthly retainer fee of standing counsels working at the Orissa Administrative Tribunal would be Rs 4,800.        
	At the district level, the retainer fee of government pleader/additional government pleader, public prosecutor and special public prosecutor would be doubled to Rs 4,000 per month.         
	Besides, a retainer fee of Rs 2,500 and Rs 2,000 per month would be introduced for associate lawyers and additional public prosecutors, respectively, for the first time.        
	Besides, the daily fees of all categories of government lawyers would be doubled, said a senior officer of the law department.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | When a piece of cake spoilt a cakewalk

It has decided to lodge an official complaint with the Centre for keeping it in the dark over the visit, which it called a violation of security norms. The Congress general secretary also spent a night at a Dalits house. (PTI)				                                 
	New Delhi, Sept 24: Getting a poll nomination is not easy but losing one can be a piece of cake.        
	A high-profile Congress ticket seeker has had the cup dashed from his lips after a photograph showed him offering a slice of cake to state BJP chief Nitin Gadkari.        
	Till then, getting a share of the poll pie had been a cakewalk for Dhananjay Dharmik, who quit his cushy job as chief income-tax commissioner to join the Congress a few months ago. His nomination from Nagpur Central had sailed through the partys screening committee and the central election committee.        
	But then the photograph surfaced and his rivals decided Dharmik couldnt have his cake and eat it too. A delegation from Nagpur met Sonia Gandhi with the picture and convinced her that Dharmiks commitment to the party was doubtful  on the sole argument that he had invited Gadkari to his birthday party.        
	So, the Congress, in which former die-hard Shiv Sainiks like Narayan Rane can become chief ministerial aspirants, reversed its decision at the last minute and handed the ticket to a former MPs son.        
	The BJP factor sank some Congress veterans too. Former Maharashtra Congress president Ranjit Deshmukh, who was seeking a ticket from Kamthi in Vidarbha, was ignored because his son Ashish had crossed over to the BJP after the Congress rebuffed his claims for nomination.        
	This, though, doesnt mean there are no concessions for the BJP. The Congress decision to field a weak candidate in Ghatkopar West against the late Pramod Mahajans daughter, Poonam, has set off a buzz in political circles. The party has picked the little-known Janet DSouza, ignoring the stronger claims of actress Nagma and a woman member of the family that runs TV network Adhikari Brothers.        
	But what takes the cake, Dharmik may say, is that former Shiv Sena hawk Sada Sarvankar has been fielded from Mahim. Even four days ago, Sarvankar had been in the Sena and, denied a ticket, had led a mob that ransacked Sena leader Manohar Joshis home. He had then joined the Congress.        
	The Congress second list, released today, keeps a few constituencies pending, including those where Vilasrao Deshmukhs son and Sushil Kumar Shindes daughter are claimants. The list reveals the different yardsticks the party has used for VIP relatives.        
	Anantrao Thopte, sitting MLA from Bhor, has been allowed to vacate his seat for son Sangramsingh. Another sitting MLA, Pramod Shende, has retired from active politics to make way for son Shekhar. But former chief minister Shivajirao Patil Nilangekar has not been allowed to vacate his seat for his son.

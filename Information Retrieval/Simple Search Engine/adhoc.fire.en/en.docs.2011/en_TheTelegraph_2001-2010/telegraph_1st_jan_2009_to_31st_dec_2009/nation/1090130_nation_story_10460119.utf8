The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ash gets SP vote
                                                                                                               Ash gets SP vote
          NALIN VERMA                          Will Pappu and Sharad make her happy?                                  
	Patna, Jan. 29: If it is Shotgun Shatru for BJP in the Patna Saheb seat, a section of Samajvadi Party (SP) leaders, and workers, wish to see former beauty queen and star bahu Aishwarya Rai Bachchan in the Yadav-dominated Madhepura Lok Sabha seat.         
	We have asked the party high command to consider Aishwaryaji for this seat. We will win if the party persuades her to contest it, said a beaming Angad Yadav, the district unit president. Senior party leader Tulsi Singh, too, concurs.         
	Now, whether these leaders would be able to persuade the waif-like actress to contest from a seat famous for its muscle-flexing dons is a matter for the future to decide, but if she does, she would be contesting against the likes of Pappu Yadav and Sharad Yadav.         
	Currently, Pappu Yadav stands convicted in the murder of CPM leader Ajit Sarkar and represents this seat in the Lok Sabha from the safety of the jail bars.         
	In 2004, RJD boss Lalu Prasad had won the Madhepura seat defeating JD(U) rival Sharad Yadav. The railway minister later retained Chapra, which he had won as well, and vacated Madhepura for Pappu Yadav. Pappus wife, Ranjita Ranjan, represents the neighbouring Saharsa in Lok Sabha and is a part of Ram Vilas Paswans Lok Janshakti Party.         
	Regarding the possibility of Aishwarya joining the poll fray on the SP ticket, state SP president Ashok Kumar Singh told The Telegraph: We are small people. It is the party high command and party president Mulayam Singh Yadav to take the final call. Only he is empowered to decide on such extraordinary issues.         
	Moreover, Ashok Singh pointed out that SP was likely to contest the polls in alliance with the UPA headed by Lalu Prasad in the state.        
	Playing safe, the RJD national spokesman and close aid to Lalu Prasad, Shyam Rajak said: The RJD has a sitting MP from Madhepura. The seat belongs to Pappu Yadav. How can other party claim it?        
	Rajak, however, added: Anyone who is more than 21 years is entitled to contest the polls. We have nothing against Aishwaryaji or against the wishes of our SP friend. But, it is for our leader (Lalu Prasad) to take a final call. What we know for a fact is that the RJD has a claim over Madhepura.         
	For RJD the biggest fear is not the actresss foray into politics but that its strongmen such as Pappu Yadav and Md Shahabuddin  also convicted for murder  may not get the election commissions clearance to enter the poll fray.         
	It is almost clear that JD(U) president Sharad Yadav will contest the Madhepura seat as an NDA candidate.         
	And how would the old-timer and veteran react to the beauty queen? As Angad Yadav replied: Sharadji will vote for Aishwarya.         
	However, what the man in question would think of such an answer remains debatable.

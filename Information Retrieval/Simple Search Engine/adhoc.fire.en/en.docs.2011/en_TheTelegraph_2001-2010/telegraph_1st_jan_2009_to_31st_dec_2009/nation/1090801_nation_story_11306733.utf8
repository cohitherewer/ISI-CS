The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bullets after a decade
                                                                                                               Bullets after a decade
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                              
	Mumbai, July 31: After about a decade of calm, mafia guns have again begun blazing in a city once scarred by underworld shootouts in full public glare.        
	Two gangsters were shot dead on Wednesday evening outside a popular caf that used to be the hangout of the D-company in the mafia capital of Dongri.         
	Local mafia boss Zahid Hassan Mir and his nephew Arshad Abrar Husain Sayeed, both aged 50 and who, according to police, ran a cricket betting syndicate, were sitting outside Caf Liberty when they were gunned down.        
	The city has not witnessed such a public shootout for over a decade, acknowledges Mumbais joint commissioner of police (crime) Rakesh Maria, who is credited, along with some others, for smoking out most of Dawood Ibrahims men after the 1993 Bombay blasts.        
	Some witnesses said the shooting was a throwback to the violent eighties when Dawoods brother-in-law Ibrahim Parkar was gunned down in Arab Gully where the caf stands.        
	Mir and Sayeed were sitting with their punters right outside Caf Liberty. Suddenly two masked gunmen walked up, pulled out their guns, rained bullets, hurried up to an old Fiat (Premier Padmini) and sped off. It all happened in a split second. Reminded me of Parkars murder, said an employee of the caf who spoke on condition that his identity would not be revealed.        
	Both Mir and Sayeed were shot through their head, the police said. It is clear that the assailants were sharp-shooters, said Maria.        
	Mir lived opposite the caf.        
	He owned a club and guesthouse above the caf. He did not carry any cellphones and kept a low profile. He did not terrorise the area in any direct way. But his connections with the D-company were well known and people were scared of him, said a local shop owner.         
	The club, a betting den, is named Bharat.        
	Mir was partnering a builder in the construction of a 15-storey apartment in the area.         
	What has baffled the police is how the two assailants could have fled in a Fiat through the narrow, crowded alleys of Dongri on a rainy day  unless they were local residents or had some local assistance.        
	No arrests have been made and the police are still unsure about the killers identity. It seems to be a revenge killing of some sort. Investigations are on, an officer said.

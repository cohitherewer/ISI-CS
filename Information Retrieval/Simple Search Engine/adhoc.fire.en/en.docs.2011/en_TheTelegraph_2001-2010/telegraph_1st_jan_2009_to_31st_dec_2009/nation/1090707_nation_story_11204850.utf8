                                                                                                               Fuse puzzle for Raipur
          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, July 6: The mystery behind detonators that went missing from Kanker forests deepened despite police recovering the truck and its driver.         
	Police have claimed that the vehicles driver, who was transporting the detonators to a National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC) facility in Dantewada, had sold the devices.         
	On the other hand, the driver has blamed Maoists for looting the vehicle (a van with registration number CG-04-7288), which had left Raipur on Sunday for Dantewada.         
	The pick-up van was one of the two that was transporting 2,500 detonators for the NMDC facility. The other vehicle was loaded with explosives. Security personnel of the state police were escorting both vans.         
	The vehicle went missing near Kanker  some 150km from here.         
	Soon after receiving the information, police launched a search operation.         
	This morning, search parties recovered the truck and its driver from dense forests of Kanker. The detonators were missing.         
	The driver probably sold the detonators and is just trying to feed a story of abduction and Maoist involvement, said deputy inspector-general of police (headquarters) Pawan Deo, talking to The Telegraph.         
	The police are now interrogating the driver (name withheld) to establish facts, he added.         
	Bastar inspector-general of police T.J. Langkumer said that the driver, in his statements, had said that the Maoists intercepted the vehicle near Sonarpal on the NH-43, overpowered the security personnel and forced everyone to get off before taking the vehicle deep inside the forests.         
	Though the officers believe that the driver sold the detonators, the incident had put them in a fix.         
	As, a detonator plays the most decisive role in explosions, especially those triggered by landmines  an area of expertise for the Maoists.         
	Now the priority for the police will be to establish where the missing detonators are even if the driver has indeed sold them to prove their suspicions.

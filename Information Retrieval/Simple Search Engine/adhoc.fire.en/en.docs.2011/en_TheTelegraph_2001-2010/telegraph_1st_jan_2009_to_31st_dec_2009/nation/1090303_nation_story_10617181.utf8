The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Diagnosis done but Advani no doctor
                                                                                                               Diagnosis done but Advani no doctor
          SANJAY K. JHA                          Advani in Delhi on Monday. (Ramakant Kushwaha)                                  
	New Delhi, March 2: The BJPs surveys suggest that voters deepest concerns relate to economic issues, but give no indication that L.K. Advani is seen as more capable than the UPA team to address these problems.        
	Party sources admit that Advanis leadership has failed to give the BJP a clear edge despite the loud propaganda to discredit the weak Congress leadership.        
	Indications are that the voters have more confidence in the Manmohan Singh-Sonia Gandhi teams ability to resolve issues like economic slowdown, rising prices and unemployment.        
	Advani has a different kind of appeal among a section of voters, but they are not animated by economic concerns. Besides, Advani has preferred not to focus on ideological issues this time and, instead, is projecting himself as a moderate, forward-looking leader who can step into Atal Bihari Vajpayees shoes.        
	Some BJP leaders believe this makeover move will not yield results since the Congress leadership has far stronger credentials on development.         
	Sources said the Sonia-Manmohan-Rahul Gandhi trio occupied a larger space in the average voters mind compared with Advani.        
	Although the BJPs surveys suggest that Advani is ahead of Manmohan personally, sources say the Congress trinitys collective appeal might outweigh Advanis.        
	Many BJP leaders feel the party cannot defeat the Congress by citing statistical data, and that only emotive issues can give the party an advantage.         
	The BJP realises that the government can portray itself as more successful than the NDA in boosting growth and the social sector.        
	The voters second concern is terrorism. This gives the BJP some hope since the UPA governments record has been abysmal on this front.        
	The BJP believes that after the Mumbai attacks, a large number of people feel that internal security is still a prime concern.         
	Since the economic slowdown and the terror attacks would both have sown a feeling of insecurity among the voters, the BJP has decided to build its campaign around the theme of Insecure India, Insecure Citizens.        
	A third plank, which fails to concern most voters but will get primacy in the BJP campaign, is the Congresss dynastic tradition. The BJP feels this issue appeals to a large section of the urban intelligentsia and educated youth.        
	Focusing on dynasty, the BJP believes, will also strengthen the feelings of anti-Congressism that drive many regional parties towards the NDA.        
	The BJP has coined a slogan, Karmayogi versus Vanshyogi, to project Advani against Rahul.         
	To counter Manmohan, the BJPs slogan would be Majboor (helpless) PM versus Majboot (strong) PM, a theme the party leadership has harped on for the past five years.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitish doubts in BJP 
                                                                                                               Nitish doubts in BJP 
          SANJAY K. JHA                          Nitish: Hiding his cards?                                  
	New Delhi, May 6: The BJP has so far dismissed the subtle Congress attempts to lure Nitish Kumar away but an element of doubt appears to have crept in.        
	Many party leaders concede in private that the Janata Dal (United) could weigh its options after the election results come in.        
	The dominant view is that the JD(U) would stick to the NDA if the coalition comes anywhere close to forming the government.        
	The NDA is certainly his first choice. But if chances of a BJP-led government recede after the results, Nitish will surely weigh his options. Unlike parties like the Akali Dal and the Shiv Sena, the JD(U) does not have any ideological affinity with us, a senior BJP leader said.        
	The BJP leadership knows that voicing suspicion about Nitishs intentions now would be bad politics, but some in the party have always been wary of the Bihar chief minister and pointed out that one of his Rajya Sabha MPs was in constant touch with finance minister P. Chidambaram. We are all aware of that channel, a BJP Rajya Sabha MP said.        
	What has fuelled the suspicions is the Congresss decision not to ally with Lalu Prasad just before the election.         
	The move appeared suicidal in the beginning but now, some BJP leaders said, it could have been the outcome of back-channel diplomacy for new alignments.        
	Nitish would gain enormously from the split in the UPA, they said, adding that the Congress might not have decided to go alone in Bihar without proper calculations.         
	But BJP leaders are convinced that Nitish would not indulge in any political misadventure, and protecting his government would figure much higher in his priorities than grabbing a role in national politics. The JD(U) shares power with the BJP in the state.        
	Although there is speculation that Nitish can align with a resurgent Congress and go in for a snap poll, several complex issues are involved in that gamble.        
	A BJP leader from Bihar said Nitish could win over a large chunk of Muslim votes by snapping ties with his NDA ally. But that, the leader added, would not be enough to give him a majority as the BJP commands the support of the forward castes, particularly the powerful Bhumihar community, and the Congress was not in a position to make up for that loss.         
	Some BJP leaders also said Nitish was a true socialist, and socialists thrive on anti-Congressism.

                                                                                                               Two cases of swine flu suspected
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Cuttack/Bhubaneswar, Aug. 10: Just as the Orissa government breathed a sigh of relief after the states first suspected swine flu patient tested negative, two more cases surfaced at Berhampur and Cuttack today.         
	In Cuttack, a girl, who recently returned from her parents home at Jamshedpur, was isolated at the special ward at SCB Medical College and Hospital.         
	The 20-year-old reached the special ward from Bhubaneswar referred by Neelanchal Hospital.         
	Reema Nayak is a second-year computer science student of Rajdhani College (Bhubaneswar) who lived at a Ashok Nagar girls hostel. The private hospital referred her after she showed no signs of recovering from cold, fever and upper respiratory infection, an SCB source said.        
	The nodal officer of the Swine Flu Response Team (SFRT), Dr D.P. Das, however, said the state had little reason to panic as both the cases were yet unconfirmed.         
	Meanwhile, the SCB Medical College Hospital today discharged Orissas first suspected swine flu patient and gave Birendra Kumar Patra, 36, a fit certificate, that would enable him to travel anywhere inside or outside the country.        
	His throat swab and blood samples were sent to Pune on Friday. Today we received the report, where Patra was found negative for swine flu, said Dr Das, while talking to The Telegraph today.        
	Yet another suspected case surfaced in Berhampur when a woman, identified as Rita Sahu of Purushottampur, was admitted to the MKCG Medical College and Hospital with symptoms of Influenza-A (H1NI). On Saturday, Rita was admitted to a private nursing home with fever. However, she was also referred to MKCG Medical College and Hospital by her doctors. A team is monitoring her round the clock.        
	Paradip port and Biju Patnaik airport authorities have beefed up screening of tourists.

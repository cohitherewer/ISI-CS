The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Fear of swine flu cluster in Punjab
                                                                                                               Fear of swine flu cluster in Punjab
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 14: Punjab health officials today placed under quarantine several teenagers in Jalandhar who developed symptoms of flu after a school trip to the US, sparking fears of Indias first cluster of the new H1N1 influenza.         
	Medical officials have admitted eight children with symptoms of fever and sore throat at the Jalandhar civil hospital and placed seven others under home quarantine after one of their schoolmates was found infected with the H1N1 virus.         
	Airport surveillance at Delhi had picked up the 17-year-old boy with fever who flew in from New York aboard a Qatar Airlines flight yesterday. The boy who was among 31 school children from Jalandhar, is currently at the airport quarantine centre.         
	His positive test result this morning led to one of the fastest tracing of contacts weve done so far, said a medical official who requested not to be named. By 10 this morning, all children from the trip were in school for another examination by doctors.         
	Weve allowed a few students who had no fever but only mild symptoms to remain at home under quarantine. Weve advised them about precautions and hygiene they and their families should adopt, said Roop Lal, the district health officer at Jalandhar said.         
	Doctors plan to provide the children and their close contacts the anti-viral drug oseltamivir which makes patients better faster, Lal said.         
	Although the 15 children in Jalandhar are still only suspects because their nasal and throat swabs are yet to be tested for the virus, the large number of suspec- ted cases at a single site has triggered concerns about a cluster of H1N1 emerging there.         
	Were trying our best to contain this. We hope no cluster emerges. But its not just the virus that will determine whether that happens. It also depends on the behaviour of the infected persons, a senior medical official in New Delhi said.         
	Preliminary scientific studies from Mexico suggest that for every 10 persons infected, there could be 12 to 16 secondary cases.         
	The Indian health ministry has outlined steps aimed at containing even clusters of infections by providing oseltamivir to every single person in a 5km zone around each cluster.         
	But such a plan is likely to prevent further spread of the virus only if there are few clusters.         
	The H1N1 virus also surfaced in Bangalore today with a 29-year old woman and a her three-year- old daughter, who flew in from New Jersey on an Air France flight, testing positive.         
	They had visited a public health facility on their own on Friday hours after they had landed.         
	Among Indias 20 confirmed H1N1 cases so far, 11 have been discharged and nine remain in quarantine in hospitals with mild symptoms.         
	The virus which appeared in Mexico early this year has infected more than 29,000 people in 74 countries and caused 145 deaths.

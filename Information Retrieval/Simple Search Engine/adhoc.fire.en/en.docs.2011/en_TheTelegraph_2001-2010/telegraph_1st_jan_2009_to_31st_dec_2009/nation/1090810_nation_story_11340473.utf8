          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 9: Naxalites today shot two men, believed to be police informers, at Chandrapur in Rayagada district early in the morning.         
	The bullet-riddled bodies were found later in the morning in two places close to each other. The deceased have been identified as Bibhishan Mahanandia, 35, and Siba Sabar of Chandrapur, 30.        
	Sabar was killed outside Gudibali gram panchayat office and Mahanandia was killed at Gadariguda village, half a kilometre from Gudibali.         
	The bodies were found in a pool of blood with the throats slit, and with bullet injuries.         
	Four residents allegedly with four Maoists in tow went to Sabars house around 3am and forcibly dragged the young man outside where they slit his throat first and then pumped in the bullets.         
	Sabar was arrested two years ago after the police discovered Maoist pamphlets from his house. He had thereafter quit guerrilla activities, which probably led to his death, said superintendent of police Ashish Singh.        
	Meanwhile, Mahanadia was working in the area as an National Rural Health Mission personnel. We suspect that he was also linked to Maoists at some point in his life but had fallen out with them after a while when he landed a government job, said the SP.        
	The bodies have been sent for autopsy. In letters left near the bodies, the rebels have stated that the duo were killed for passing information to police on both sides of the border  Orissa and Andhra  said superintendent of police Ashish Singh. The letter also warned residents against co-operating with the police and working against the rebels. On Thursday, another young man, Gopinath Lima, in Gudari area of the district, was killed by rebels.         
	In their letters, the rebels have also demanded the release of their cadre who were arrested recently.        
	A massive combing operation has been launched by CRPF and Orissa police personnel in the area to nab the Maoists, while additional forces have been deployed in the area, said Purushottam Sahu, of the Orissa Special Armed Police (Osap).

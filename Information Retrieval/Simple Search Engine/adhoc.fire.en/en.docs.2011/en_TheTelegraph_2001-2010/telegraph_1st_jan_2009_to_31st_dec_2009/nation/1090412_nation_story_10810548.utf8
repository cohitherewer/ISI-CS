The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pak poll offer on Taliban
                                                                                                               Pak poll offer on Taliban
          NASIR JAFFRY                              
	Islamabad, April 11: Pakistan today said it was ready to work with India to avert attacks by Taliban insurgents during the elections but asked for relevant information so that it could co-operate fully.        
	We have seriously taken a statement by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh fearing (terror) attacks by Pakistan-based Taliban during elections in India, interior ministry chief Rehman Malik told a news conference.        
	Malik said Islamabad had taken the comment seriously because it came from the highest level in India and asked for details or any other information that prompted it.         
	Asked if Pakistan had evidence about Indian involvement in last months attacks on the Sri Lankan cricketers and the police training academy near Lahore, he said he had asked Lahore city police chief Pervez Rathore to explain in what sense he had taken Indias name.        
	Malik said Rathore  who yesterday claimed the police had evidence about Indias involvement  might have based his statement on information gathered from the lone terrorist suspect captured during the police academy attack. This suspect came from Afghanistan and got settled in Pakistan, he said and added his father had married an Indian.        
	However, he added, there was nothing on record as yet to suggest Indias involvement in the attacks.

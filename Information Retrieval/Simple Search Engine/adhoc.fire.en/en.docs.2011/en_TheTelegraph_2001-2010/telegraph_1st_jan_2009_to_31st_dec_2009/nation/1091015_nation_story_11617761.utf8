The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Germany competes with US for Indian researchers   Faculty positions cause for concern 
                                                                                                               Germany competes with US for Indian researchers     Faculty positions cause for concern 
          G.S. MUDUR                          Badri Krishnan, an Indian physicist who moved from the US to Germany                                        
	Berlin, Oct. 14: Thulasi Warrier had just the right credentials to pursue research in America  a degree from the Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, and research experience at an academic centre in Bangalore.        
	But Warrier applied for and was selected for a doctoral programme here at the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology where she is now searching for new molecules to fight tuberculosis bacteria.        
	In her laboratory and other institutions here, Indian researchers span the sciences and touch the humanities. Calcuttas Arunava Dasgupta is trying to develop a vaccine against tuberculosis. IIT-Kanpur alumnus Badri Krishnan is looking for ripples in space called gravitational waves. History student Nadeem Shah from Delhi is exploring how Sufi music influenced emotions in 19th century India.        
	Yet, from Germanys perspective, the count of Indian researchers isnt big enough. German academic centres, competing against US universities and perceptions of a language barrier, want more talent from India.        
	Germany is facing an acute shortage of staff for science and technology, said Bernd Wirsing, head of the local office of Germanys public-funded Max Planck Society, which supports basic research in diverse areas  physics to biology to cultural studies  in 80 institutes. A nation already short of 60,000 specialists, Wirsing estimates, needs an additional 50,000 junior staff each year to replace retiring scientists.        
	Student flow patterns suggest Germany could get more researchers from India.        
	Over the past three years, nearly 70,000 graduate students moved each year from India to the US. In the same period, Germany received under 4,000 students annually from India in contrast to about 25,000 students each year from China.        
	Were seeking long-term connections with India, said Peter Gruss, a biologist and president of the Society who, 38 years ago, had driven his Volkswagen Beetle from Germany to India where he put his arms around the Ashoka iron pillar at the Qutab Minar, explored Varanasi and vegetarian food. We want our institutes to establish connections with Indias future scientists, Gruss said.        
	The Society is trying to draw researchers from India through fellowships and build bridges with those who return to India through a mechanism called the Max Planck partner groups. This mechanism offers select researchers who return to India euro 20,000 (Rs 13.6 lakh) annually for five years to buy equipment, recruit young scientists, or travel to conferences while continuing to work with Max Planck scientists.        
	Over the past three years, the number of Max Planck partner groups in India has climbed to 15  out of 43 world-wide. Its the fastest rate of growth in any country, said Felix Kahle, the Societys representative in India.        
	At IIT-Roorkee, professor Bhola Gurjar formed a partner group with the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz. The collaboration examined the impact of traffic and industry emissions on mega cities  Calcutta, Delhi and Mumbai.        
	German academic agencies emphasise that science in Germany is mainly practised in English, but doctoral and postdoctoral researchers from India say they experience a disadvantage over their contemporaries whove moved to the US.        
	Its harder to get permanent faculty positions in Germany than in North America, said Krishnan, who moved from a postdoctoral position at the University of Pennsylvania in the US to become a senior scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics at Potsdam.        
	 There are growing opportunities in Germany, but for those who are keen on getting permanent positions outside India, North America will probably remain the primary destination, Krishnan said.        
	About 80 per cent of researchers who move from India to Germany are involved in engineering, natural sciences or medicine, according to German academic agencies. But opportunities also exist in history and culture.        
	At the Max Planck Institute for Human Development here, doctoral student Shah is examining how changes in emotions associated with Sufi music influenced social and political dynamics in northern India during the early 19th century. His research guide is Margrit Pernau, a historian with the title of senior scientist, who is investigating the evolution of emotions in Bollywood films.

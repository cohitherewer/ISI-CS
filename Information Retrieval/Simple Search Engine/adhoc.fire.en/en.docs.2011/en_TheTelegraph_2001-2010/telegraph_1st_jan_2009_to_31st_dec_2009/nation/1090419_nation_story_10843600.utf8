          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 18: The Congress and the CPM punched holes in BJP leader L.K. Advanis demand for repatriation of funds illegally stashed in Swiss banks and other tax havens.        
	Union minister Kapil Sibal accused the previous NDA government, of which Advani was the deputy Prime Minister, of indirectly helping those who put away their illegal money in foreign banks by replacing the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (Fera) with the Foreign Exchange Management Act (Fema).        
	Describing Advanis demand for return of funds as laudable, Sibal reminded him that Fema had virtually let off Fera offenders through a sunset clause that allowed ongoing cases to be dropped if the prosecution was unable to prove charges within two years of the enactment of the new law on June 1, 2000.        
	The Congress leader also asked why the BJP manifesto had no mention of Advanis demand.         
	Fema had for the first time allowed foreign exchange violations to be treated as civil offences. It was at the time criticised by some experts who said loopholes in the law would result in large-scale flight of capital. The two-year time frame for completing all Fera cases was also criticised as unrealistic since the investigations had to deal with banking secrecy laws in other countries.         
	The CPM politburo today quoted from the BJPs own report to put the party on the mat. Referring to a study of the Washington-based Global Financial Integrity, the BJP report had said that from 2002 to 2006, $27.3 billion was smuggled out of India annually.         
	The CPM pointed out that for two out of these four years, the BJP was in power at the centre.         
	Then nearly $55-billion worth of illicit transfers occurred in the two-year period  2002 to 2004  under the BJP-led government itself. What did he (Advani) do to prevent such illegal transfers when he was in power? the party asked.         
	Unfazed by the criticism, Advani continued to tell voters at election rallies that black money stashed in Swiss banks was peoples money and that if voted to power, he would bring it back in 100 days and use it for development, adds PTI.

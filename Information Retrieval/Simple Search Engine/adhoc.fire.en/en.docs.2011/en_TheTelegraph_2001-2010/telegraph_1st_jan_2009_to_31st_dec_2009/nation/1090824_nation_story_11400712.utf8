The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Jaswant meets Atal, gets blessings
                                                                                                               Jaswant meets Atal, gets blessings
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 23: Jaswant Singh today visited Atal Bihari Vajpayee at his home and claimed to have received the blessings of the BJPs tallest leader.        
	The expelled MP, known to be close to the former Prime Minister, said Vajpayee knew everything about the state of affairs in the party.        
	Asked if he had told Vajpayee what the BJP had done to him, Jaswant said: He watches television and is aware of everything. No further analysis is needed.        
	Party sources had earlier said Vajpayee had been anguished at Jaswants expulsion.        
	I keep coming to meet Vajpayeeji once in a fortnight, Jaswant said. Today, I came here to wish him on the occasion of Ganesh Chaturthi and seek his blessings.        
	The meeting has symbolic significance against the backdrop of turmoil in the BJP and Jaswants allegations about Advanis positions on the Kandahar terrorist trade-off and the Gujarat riots.        
	This is Jaswants first meeting with a senior BJP leader after his expulsion last week for praising Mohammad Ali Jinnah in his book. He had yesterday met former cabinet colleague and Janata Dal (United) leader George Fernandes.        
	Jaswant has not eased his attacks on the BJP. He told an interviewer today the decision to expel him was narrow-minded. Asked if Advani had called him after the expulsion, he said: No. But it doesnt matter now and its too late.        
	Jaswant said after informing him about his expulsion, BJP president Rajnath Singh had said they would discuss the issue some other time, which never happened.        
	Advani came under attack also from senior RSS leader M.G. Vaidya, who wrote in a Marathi daily that the way BJP leaders were vying with each other to praise Jinnah was surprising. He asked the reason for Advanis decision to praise Jinnah in the first place, which created misgivings among party workers.        
	He also asked leaders above 75 to retire from politics, reinforcing the view that the RSS wants a change in the BJP. Vaidya said the reins of the Jan Sangh had been handed to young leaders, and it was wrong to assume that young leaders cannot run a party.

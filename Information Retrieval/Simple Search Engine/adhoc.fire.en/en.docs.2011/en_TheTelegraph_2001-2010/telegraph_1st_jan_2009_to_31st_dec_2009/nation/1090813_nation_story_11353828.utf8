	Mumbai, Aug. 12: As the countrywide swine flu toll touched 17, the Maharashtra government decided to cancel the Dahi-Handi festivities and shut down schools, colleges and cinemas for a few days to contain the spread of the H1N1 virus.        
	Doctors, and even the countrys health minister, have been urging people not to venture out of their homes to prevent the rapid progression of the pandemic.        
	The toll continued to climb with four persons dying at the Sassoon Hospital in Pune which now accounts for 10 deaths. Those who succumbed have been identified as Shrawani Deshpande, 29, Nita Meghani, 50, Balu Kuland, 33, and Gautham Shalar, 48. Nashik registered its first flu death when 28-year-old doctor Rupesh Gangurde died this morning.         
	With the infection spreading fast, the Maharashtra government ordered the closure of schools and colleges in Mumbai for a week and theatres and multiplexes for three days.         
	The immediate fallout of the cinema shutdown was the deferring of the release in Mumbai of the much-awaited Vishal Bharadwaj film Kaminey.         
	The worldwide release of Kaminey will go on as planned on August 14. We are releasing in 1,200 theatres across the world on that day. But in Mumbai, we will follow the government directive and release it only when the theatres are expected to open on Sunday. We do not anticipate any big losses as there are no big releases coming up till mid-September and the film will have a free run, said Siddharth Roy Kapoor, chief executive officer of UTV Motion Pictures.        
	Abbas-Mastans Fardeen Khan-Genelia DSouza-starrer Life Partner too will have a deferred release in Mumbai.        
	The worldwide release of Life Partner will go on. In Mumbai, the film will release on August 16, said Aman Gill, who heads domestic film distribution for Studio 18.        
	Even Love Aaj Kal, currently in its third week, is expected to suffer.        
	Filmmakers, though, are not too happy about the decision since the industry had been hit hard by the revenue sharing spat earlier in the year. In Pune, multiplexes have been closed for three days since Tuesday.        
	It is ridiculous. Whats the point of a three-day ban when people are constantly converging in crowded places otherwise  travelling in packed commuter trains. This is a knee-jerk reaction, said a senior functionary of the producers guild.        
	The markets appeared to voice the producers concern. Multiplex stocks took a beating after the government announced their closure for three days.

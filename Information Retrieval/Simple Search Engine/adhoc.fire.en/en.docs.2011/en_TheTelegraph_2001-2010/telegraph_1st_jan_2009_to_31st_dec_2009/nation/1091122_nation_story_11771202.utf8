The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Trust Cong to be sugary
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Trust Cong to be sugary
  - Opposition finds credit-rahul cry too sweet to swallow           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Security was sent into a tizzy but both Rahul Gandhi and sister Priyanka emerged unhurt on Saturday from freak accidents that could have caused greater damage.        
	Rahul was shaking hands with supporters after a meeting at the Bariatu Ground in Ranchi when the barricade gave way. The Congress leader had jumped the first barricade when securitymen asked him to come back. He complied but continued to shake hands when the barricade on the side of the 500-strong crowd gave in. Rahul was unhurt.         
	Separately, a police escort vehicle hit a car in the motorcade of Priyanka, on her way to Amethi, from behind. She was not in the green Toyota Qualis, the same car which she drove with Rahul at her side on Friday. (Prashant Mitra and PTI)              
	New Delhi, Nov. 21: The Congress ploy of crediting Rahul Gandhi with the resolution of the sugar-pricing crisis has rattled the Opposition but junior partner NCP, whose leader Sharad Pawar is being painted as the villain of the piece, has decided to grin and bear it.        
	Although the Nationalist Congress Party resents the Congress dragging Rahul into every story and doubts if he was the key player behind the rollback, its official reaction reflected the caution most parties adopt while dealing with the young Gandhi.        
	NCP spokesperson D.P. Tripathi said: We congratulate Rahul for raising the concerns of the sugarcane farmers.        
	Asked about the reports that he had earlier contested the Congress claim that Rahul had raised the issue with the Prime Minister, Tripathi said: This is contrary to what I said.        
	The Centre yesterday rolled back an ordinance on sugarcane price that had brought thousands of angry farmers to Delhi and united Opposition parties.        
	Tripathi defended Pawar against allegations that he was trying to help mill owners at the cost of sugarcane farmers. It is the collective responsibility of the Union cabinet and not the agriculture minister alone. The ordinance was passed by the cabinet at a meeting chaired by (the) Prime Minister, he said.        
	Pawar, who chose to hit out at the Opposition today, avoided any critical reference to the Congresss Rahul ploy.        
	However, a PTI report said, when Pawar was dubbed sugarcane king by the Uttar Pradesh agriculture minister today, he jokingly passed the compliment on to Rahul and Rashtriya Lok Dal leader Ajit Singh, who had organised the farmers agitation.        
	The agency quoted Pawar as saying: I do not know where the sugarcane farmers have gone. Some people say it is Rahul Gandhi, some say it is Ajit Singh.        
	Congress leaders claimed that Rahul was in the loop and wanted the interests of the farmers protected. A leader said: We did not give credit to him on false grounds. Everybody knows Rahuls politics. He is pro-poor, pro-farmer, pro-common man.        
	The Opposition is aghast at this attempt to hijack the glory. Ajit said the credit went to the farmers alone. BJP leader Sushma Swaraj said the united Opposition should share the acclaim.        
	Samajwadi leader Amar Singh said: If Rahul Gandhi is getting all the good things done, the Congress should make him the Prime Minister. We have no problem in dealing with him as Prime Minister.

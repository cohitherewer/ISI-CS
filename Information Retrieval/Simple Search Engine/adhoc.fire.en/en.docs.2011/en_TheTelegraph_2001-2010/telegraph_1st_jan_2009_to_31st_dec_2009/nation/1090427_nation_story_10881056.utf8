          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, April 26: Five hundred armed CPI(Maoist) cadre encircled Chonha village under Dumaria police station area in Gaya on Saturday at 5pm for a seven-hour operation that was conducted in a most leisurely fashion.        
	The rebels, in their second operation in the village within 24 hours, blew up the primary health centre, the middle school building and the community hall using dynamites and explosives.         
	Earlier, they had blown up the Chonha police outpost.        
	Afterwards, the cadre also raided the two-storey house of Maqsood Khan, a wealthy farmer and former mukhiya of Narainpur panchayat in Dumaria block. Using walkie-talkies, the men directed the mukhiyas wife, daughter and two domestic helps to move out of the house as they were going to blow it up.         
	Once the women ran out, the rebels conducted a seizure of movable assets in the house falling under the so-called liberated zone.        
	According to the mukhiyas son, Rizwan Khan, the rebels looted 100 quintals of rice, an equal quantity of wheat, 10 quintals of gram, potatoes and onions, clothes, about 100gm of gold jewellery and 1kg of silver ornaments and utensils.         
	Before leaving they blew up the two-storeyed house.        
	Rizwan who was in the neighbouring village when the operation began informed senior police officers, including Gaya superintendent of police and Magadh director-general of police. To his surprise, one of the senior officers advised him to evacuate his family as the police could do little in such matters.        
	Panicky villagers also reportedly rang Ali Khan, a resident of the area who lives in Mumbai, who in turn relayed the information to politicians in Patna.         
	Ironically, police played the Bollywood script and reached the spot after everything was over.        
	Conceding that she did receive information, DIG Anupama Nilekar said steps were taken by the police for area domination and parties were also dispatched.         
	When asked if her statement meant that the incident took place in the presence of the police, the DIG said that she would find out if her directions were complied to.        
	Villagers claimed that police reached Chonha on Sunday morning, a good 15 hours after the siege and attacks. The force was greeted by go back slogans by the villagers.         
	The village, which has housed a central paramilitary forces picket since 1991, recently saw it being withdrawn for election duty elsewhere in the state.

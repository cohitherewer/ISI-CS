	New Delhi, May 15: The election results will be out only tomorrow, but the Congress ad campaign has scored over the BJPs already. Its Jai Ho jingle is way ahead of the rivals Bhay Ho, a survey has found.         
	Ad Verdict-09, by international marketing agency IMRB, says the Jai Ho ad hit the target much better than the BJPs parody. Jai Ho was liked best by 76 per cent of the target group. The four ads selected for the study were the BJPs Bhay Ho and the Dishayein campaign, and Congresss Jai Ho and Kadam campaign. The Congress ads made a strong impact on women, the poor and voters with no party leanings.

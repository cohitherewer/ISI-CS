  - Youth calls father for Rs 20-lakh ransom
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 28: A Delhi youth faked his own kidnapping and nearly cheated his businessman father of Rs 20 lakh to fulfil his girlfriends wish of spending New Years Eve in Macau.        
	Pawan Verma will be nowhere near his dream, nor will he be in the company of his lady love: the 22-year-old will welcome 2010 with other undertrials in Tihar jail.        
	To fulfil his girlfriends wish, Pawan had already borrowed Rs 8.5 lakh but it seems he needed more. So he, along with a friend, hatched the plan for his own kidnapping. Both have been arrested, deputy commissioner (central) of police Jaspal Singh said.        
	But the young man in a hurry to get to Macau, a hotspot for the rich and famous near Hong Kong, appeared to betray equally hasty planning.        
	Pawans father Ram Sahay Verma told the police that he received a call on his mobile asking him to pay Rs 20 lakh on December 26, hours after his son had left the familys spectacles shop in central Delhis Karol Bagh saying he would be back in 15 minutes.        
	But he (Pawan) never came back. When I called him on his mobile, an unknown person answered and said Pawan had been kidnapped. I could never guess Pawan was up to such tricks, Verma said in his complaint.        
	Later, the ransom demand and the place where it should be delivered was repeated  but through messages from an unknown number to Vermas cellphone.        
	We started replying to the SMSes and tracked the mobile through its IMEI number (the unique code for every handset). First, they wanted the money left at a spot near his home. Verma did as told but was soon asked to return home with the cash, kept in a black bag, probably because the boys got suspicious, an officer said.        
	After this, the delivery locations were changed and eventually on December 27, Vermas other son Puneet was asked to drop the bag in a secluded stretch near a mall. With the cops lying in wait, Puneet left the bag and had just begun to drive away when a tall man in a hooded black jacket came to take the bag. It wasnt any kidnapper but Pawan himself.

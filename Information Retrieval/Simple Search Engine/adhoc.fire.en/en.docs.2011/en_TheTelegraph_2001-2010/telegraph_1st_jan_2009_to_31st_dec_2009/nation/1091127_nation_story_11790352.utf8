          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Nov. 26: Koiri caste leader Upendra Kushwaha today staged a comeback to the ruling JD(U) in the presence of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar. Upendra merged his Samata Party with JD(U).        
	The JD(U) had expelled Kushwaha in 2007 in the wake of differences between him and Nitish Kumar. Kushwahas departure was a jolt to the Law-Kush (Kurmi-Koiri) combination constituting the nucleus of the JD(U) support base in the state.         
	Today, Nitish Kumar declared that Upendra Kushwaha has come back home.        
	Kushwaha, too, announced that he would work hard to ensure that Nitish Kumar regained power for the second term after the Assembly polls next year. We will work hard among the people for retaining power in the state, he said.

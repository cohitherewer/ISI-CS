          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Nitesh Rane at the protest in Mumbai. (Fotocorp)                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 3: A demonstration against a water supply cut in the city turned bloody today when police caned the protesters, sending 15 people to hospital, one of whom died of causes that are still unclear.        
	The water cuts were implemented in July but the protest came two days after the Shiv Sena bagged the Mumbai mayors post, embarrassing Congress leader Narayan Rane, entrusted with the job of handling the mayor election.        
	Ranes son Nitesh organised the protest this morning at Azad Maidan, across the street from the civic headquarters. Police said the lathi-charge was ordered after the crowd of 5,000, mostly activists of Niteshs NGO Swabhiman, came out of the venue and tried to storm the civic headquarters.        
	Swabhiman activist Viral Dholakia, 43, who tried to run away and fell, was declared dead at GT Hospital.        
	Although Swabhiman claimed he had died of injuries suffered in the lathi-charge, additional police commissioner R.K. Padmanabhan said Dholakia had a medical condition and died of a heart attack.        
	A.V. Kulkarni, the GT Hospital superintendent, said Dholakia had no visible injury marks. A post-mortem has been conducted and its report is awaited.        
	The crowd turned unruly outside the civic headquarters and they could have gone out of control if they had entered the building. We tried to use as little force as possible, Padmanabhan said.        
	A few women, disabled people and journalists covering the protest suffered minor injuries. Elsewhere in the city, at least five people were injured, two of them grievously, in separate water-related protests.        
	The police arrested 24 Swabhiman activists including Nitesh for rioting and obstructing a government servant from performing his duty. Produced before a local court, Rane and 12 others were granted bail.        
	If the aam aadmi cant raise his voice even over water cuts, what should he do? (Civic) officials are attributing the water cuts to the deficient monsoon, but unauthorised water connections, water leak and thefts are responsible for the crisis. The people in power are involved with the water mafia (tanker owners), Nitesh alleged .        
	Why dont they impose water cuts on five stars and big shopping malls? Rich people and Matoshree (Bal Thackerays bungalow) get 24-hour water supply. Why should the aam aadmi suffer? Nitesh asked.        
	Political sources said Rane, having engineered defections in the Sena in the past, had hoped to do so again during the mayors election.

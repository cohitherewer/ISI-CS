          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, Aug. 27: He was training to be a policeman, but turned out to be a thief.         
	Raipur police today arrested a suspended trainee, Vinod Kumar Baghel, on charges of lifting two-wheelers from different places around Chhattisgarh.        
	According to officer R.N. Sengar, Baghel joined the service six months ago and was training at a Mana school near Raipur. Two months ago, he ran away from school before completing his training and was thus placed under suspension.        
	In the past fortnight, Baghel lifted two motorcycles within DD-nagar police station limits, however, left leads enough for his former employees to catch him. He had strangely buried a motorcycle in his courtyard while another he kept in the house. Yesterday evening his former trainers laid a trap and successfully nabbed him from his Dangania residence, Sengar added. He said that Baghel was involved in other crimes as well and officers were now trying to unravel all links. An offence under Section 389 of the IPC has been registered against him.        
	According to police sources, his neighbours had complained that Bhagel was found mostly in an inebriated state since he left the police school. They suspect that it was around this time that he started committing small crimes.

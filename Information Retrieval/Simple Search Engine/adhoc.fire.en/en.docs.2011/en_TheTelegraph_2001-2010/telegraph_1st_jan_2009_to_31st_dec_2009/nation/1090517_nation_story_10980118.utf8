   From north to east, roar of a tempest

	May 16: Little revolutions in Bengal and Uttar Pradesh have powered the UPAs charge to Delhi.        
	Bengal today could well be a village named Nandigram, the tipping point that has cost the Left a majority in an election in the state after 32 years  the length of a generation.        
	Uttar Pradesh could well be a town called Akbarpur, which symbolises the winds of change that have blown an unexpected 21 seats the Congresss way, the partys biggest tally since 1989 in Indias politically most important state.        
	Akbarpur is used to being the nursery of change. The town in eastern Uttar Pradesh, which has now given Mayavati a nasty surprise, had been a starting point for the Bahujan Samaj Partys march towards gifting Lucknow its first majority government in 19 years.        
	Mayavati had won Akbarpur in the 1998 Lok Sabha elections by experimenting with her brand of social engineering that seeks to weld disparate castes and communities. She replicated the Akbarpur model in her 2007 Assembly poll triumph.        
	Two years later, it has failed, not least in Akbarpur.        
	Former loyalist Rajaram Pal, whom Mayavati had expelled when he was implicated in the cash-for-query scam, fought on a Congress ticket this time and defeated the BSPs Brahmin nominee in Akbarpur. Sections of Mayavatis Most Backward Caste, Brahmin and Dalit voters backed Pal whose only plank was that he had been wronged by Behenji. But the message was clear: Mayavatis winning formula had come unstuck.        
	On April 29, a day before the elections began in Bengal, Saiyam Qazi of Nandigram had predicted (as reported in the April 30 edition of The Telegraph) that the Congress-Trinamul-SUCI would win 26 of the states 42 seats. This evening, the final tallies uncannily matched that figure.        
	The Left will now be more contrite than ever before. This had been in evidence even before this election; now it will present its best face right up to the 2011 Assembly elections.        
	Left leaders will also have to be ready to face questions from the rank and file. Between 2004 and today, the front has plummeted from its highest-ever total into an abyss of political irrelevance. Bengal, its strongest bastion, has crumbled. The leaders will have to explain.        
	For the state government, the result means policy-making is likely to remain a risky business, at least till 2011.        
	For Mamata, the victory means she and the Congress would have to work at keeping the alliance going. Pressure will mount from the lower rungs to stay together now that they have tasted success.        
	She will also face a desperate call to goad the Centre into dismissing the state government. Such a move will probably play into the Lefts hands, with campaigning for 2011 beginning now.        
	If Nandigram had sounded the alarm bells for the Left, a defeat last March in a bypoll in Bhadohi put Mayavatis back up. But rather than calmly analyse why things went wrong, she publicly rebuked the Brahmin MPs and MLAs from the region and warned they would be denied tickets.        
	Two of them left to join the Congress. They told their confidants that ultimately, the Congress was the Brahmins best bet and that it was time they stopped their dalliances with regional outfits.        
	If the unravelling of Mayavatis social alliance was one key reason for the Congresss surprise showing, another was Rahul Gandhis decision to go solo in the state.        
	Congress sources said Rahul had reasoned that the party could not keep looking south and west for its numbers: it must get its act together in Uttar Pradesh, the Gandhis backyard, and Bihar.        
	After the 2007 drubbing, Rahul had begun reviving the party organisation in bits and pieces, especially in the past six months. In the meantime, Muslims and Brahmins began to get disenchanted with the Samajwadi Party and the BSP.        
	The Brahmins, among the opinion-makers in the state, spoke openly of their distaste of the thought of seeing Mayavati as Prime Minister. They said they voted for her in 2007 only because they wanted to be rid of the Samajwadis.        
	The BJPs attraction had already weakened for the Brahmins after Atal Bihari Vajpayees fadeout. L.K. Advani didnt interest them. When Rahul rejected an alliance with the Samajwadis, the Brahmins  once the core of the Congresss support base in the state  were excited.        
	The Muslims were upset with Mulayam Singh Yadav for embracing Kalyan Singh.        
	Having retrieved part of its Muslim and Brahmin votes, the Congress will be looking to consolidate. Sources say it must work hard to get the Dalits back and reach out to the Most Backward Castes.        
	An Uttar Pradesh leader said: One swallow doesnt make a summer. Yet the summer of 2009 has the potential to trigger a Congress turnaround in the countrys political heartland.

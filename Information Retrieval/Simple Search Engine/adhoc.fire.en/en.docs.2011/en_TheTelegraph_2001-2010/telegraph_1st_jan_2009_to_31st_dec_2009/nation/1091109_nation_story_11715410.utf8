          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 8: An eye for an eye and a bite for a bite.        
	Ramesh Jamda, 25, of Bhubaneswar, who chewed off a good part of a snake after it bit him, surely believes it!        
	Ramesh, a gardener at citys BDA Park located at Bermuda Road, was following his daily routine of mowing the park grass last morning, when he felt a sharp pain in his thumb.        
	Looking down, he saw a foot-long rat snake biting onto his thumb. As Ramesh tried to shake off the reptile, the pain increased, as it dug its fangs deeper into the flesh.         
	The young gardener then used scissors to remove the snake. Though the reptile fell off, a furious Ramesh grabbed the reptile and began to bite it, tail onwards.         
	Soon, the young man had torn and chewed two-thirds of the snake in his fury. Few minutes after the act, queasiness settled in and after vomiting quite a few times, Ramesh fainted.        
	Park employees then rushed Ramesh to the Capital hospital.        
	I was angry when the snake bit me on my finger. I bit it back because that was my way of taking revenge, Ramesh told doctors after he gained consciousness.         
	His condition is said to be stable now.

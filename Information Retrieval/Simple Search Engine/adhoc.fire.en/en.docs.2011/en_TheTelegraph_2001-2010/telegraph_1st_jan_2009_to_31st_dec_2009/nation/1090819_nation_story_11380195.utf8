                                                                                                               Courts not to interfere in govt staff transfers
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 18: The Supreme Court has upheld the Airports Authority of Indias right to shift employees, saying courts should not normally interfere with administrative decisions such as transfer of government staff.        
	The observation came at a hearing when a two-judge bench set aside an Allahabad High Court interim order staying the May 2009 transfer of an AAI senior manager from Lucknow to Kozhikode.        
	In a matter of transfer of a government employee, the bench said, the scope of judicial review is limited and (the) high court would not interfere with an order of transfer lightly, be it at (an) interim stage or final hearing.        
	Courts, the bench explained, do not substitute their own decision in the matter of transfer.         
	Rajeev Ratan Pandey, a senior manager, engineering (civil), had moved court against his transfer, saying it went against the policy that inter-regional transfers would not be made before a person finished five years in a post.        
	Pandey made a representation to the authority on May 25 for cancellation of his transfer. On May 28, he was relieved from his posting at Lucknow. His appeal was rejected on June 2.        
	The official sent a letter to the director, airport authority, Kozhikode, saying he was under treatment and would join work at his new posting as soon as he got well.        
	On July 3, he moved the high court alleging mala fide. The same day the court passed the interim order staying the transfer. The authority then appealed to the apex court that said allegations of mala fide must be supported by requisite materials.

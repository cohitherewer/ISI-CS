The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Centre calls family lawyer for talks
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Centre calls family lawyer for talks
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    A picture of Ruchika Girhotra (top), and SPS Rathore                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 29: The lawyer for Ruchika Girhotras family will meet top home ministry officials tomorrow after the Centre decided to act against convicted former Haryana police chief S.P.S. Rathore.        
	The ministry called Pankaj Bhardwaj to Delhi tomorrow to discuss how to pursue the case, as the noose appeared to be tightening around the retired officer.        
	While the home ministry geared up for action, law minister Veerappa Moily made it clear that not only Rathore, but all those in positions of power who allegedly subverted the law would also face stern action.        
	This can be a model case where we will have to demonstrate to the entire country that the rule of law is utmost and it will apply to everybody Moily told a private television channel today.        
	For Ruchikas family, however, the future is still fraught with uncertainty after 19 years of suffering.        
	There is hope but I do not know. Until something concrete happens, I cannot say anything but for the fact that I will extend all assistance requested by the home ministry, Bhardwaj told The Telegraph from Chandigarh.        
	Bhardwaj, who will call on Union home secretary G.K. Pillai tomorrow, also met the Haryana director-general of police today as chief minister B.S. Hooda personally looked into the case.        
	Moily said the government was thinking on two points.        
	The first is to appeal for an enhanced punishment for the accused under Section 354 of the penal code (molestation), he said.        
	The second point is whether to start fresh investigations to see whether Rathore and others could be charged with abetment of suicide under Section 305 or 306 of the IPC.        
	If convicted under Section 305, which deals with abetment of suicide by a minor, Rathore could face a life sentence and so would government authorities who did his bidding.        
	This would include school authorities who threw Ruchika out and police officials who harassed Ruchikas brother.        
	Under Section 306, abetting suicide carries a maximum punishment of 10 years in jail.        
	The law minister also urged the National Commission for Women to move the apex court.        
	Home ministry sources said the action against Rathore could include the CBI filing an appeal for sterner punishment and suspension of pension. The CBI director has got a copy of the judgment (sentencing Rathore to six months in jail) and they will examine it for an appeal. Consultations are also on with the law ministry to examine possibilities of more cases, said a senior home ministry official.        
	The matter is under examination. All aspects are being considered by our legal experts, bureau spokesperson Harsh Bahl said.

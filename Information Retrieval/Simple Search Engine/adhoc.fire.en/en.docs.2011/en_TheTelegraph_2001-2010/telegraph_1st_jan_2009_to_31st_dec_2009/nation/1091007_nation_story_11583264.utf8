The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Statue-stung SC reads Delhi act to Maya
                                                                                                               Statue-stung SC reads Delhi act to Maya
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                          Mayavati: Under fire                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 6: The Supreme Court today hinted that the Mayavati governments flagrant violation of its orders not to build statues and memorials amounted to a breakdown of the rule of law, warranting dismissal by the Centre.        
	The observation led to interpretation among political circles that the Centre was being virtually given a free hand to enforce the courts orders by posting central forces at the sites or dismissing the state government under Article 356 for breakdown of constitutional machinery.        
	The interpretation was rooted in a specific court warning that if the constructions continued, the ball would be in the Centres court.         
	The veiled sack threat came along with a contempt notice to chief secretary Atul Gupta for failing to comply with the courts September 11 order forbidding any work. He has been asked to personally appear in the court on November 4 and explain his position.        
	Our order covered all projects. You are playing hide and seek with the court. You want a confrontation, have a confrontation, Justices B.N. Agrawal and Aftab Alam said. They were referring to the states earlier submissions that work was going on at only those sites that were not locked in legal disputes.         
	Are you a responsible, democratic government? the court wondered as the states senior counsel Harish N. Salve insisted that construction was on at the sites that were not in dispute.         
	The judges asked under whose orders the undisputed 30 acres had been segregated from the disputed 75 acres. The entire land is one big block in Lucknows Gomtinagar area.         
	Told that chief secretary Gupta had passed the orders orally, the judges said it was a strong prima facie case of contempt and directed the court registry to immediately file such a case.        
	We accepted a complete undertaking from you (the state government) and you found two loopholes in it. We were then forced to pass a restraint order. Then you close the maintenance and repair window and open another  that work was on at sites that were beyond the writ petitions (pending in courts), the bench said.         
	The government had claimed it had only carried out cleaning work at the sites before saying construction was on at places against which there were no cases.        
	Several petitions have been filed against Mayavatis statue and memorial-building spree in Allahabad High Court and the Supreme Court on environmental grounds, and for alleged waste of Rs 2,600-crore public money.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitish pits janata against govt
                                                                                                               Nitish pits janata against govt

	Patna, Feb. 11: During vikas yatra or development rally of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, the aam aadmi seems to have found his voice at last. And most of them seem to be clamouring for similar demands.         
	Take Rampari Devi, an elderly woman, for instance. The senior woman managed to confront chief minister Nitish Kumar at Dhakjhari in Darbhanga. Her complaint: I do not get foodgrain and I do not figure in the BPL list. The mukhiya asks for a bribe, if I tell him to include my name in the (BPL) list.        
	As she complaints, mukhiya, Seetal Jha, is in the crowd of elected representatives following Nitish, who commands: Ensure that Rampariji has her name included in the list.         
	In the same vein, Nitish warns people not to elect corrupt people as mukhiyas.        
	Nitishs vikas yatra began on January 18 and is now in its third phase. So far, the chief minister has met lakhs of citizens and has received thousands of complaints (recorded) from them.         
	Most complaints are either related to a bribe demand made by an elected representative or official or is related to the Indira Awas Yojana. Many deal with the inclusion of names in the BPL list or poor pension.        
	Initially, Nitish tried suspending officials in Darbhanga and Sitarmahi or recommending proceedings against them. However, sensing that isolated action would not suffice, Nitish has evolved a campaign to root out corruption at the micro-level.         
	The government has decided to reward Rs 1,000 to Rs 50,000 to a person who would help nab an official or public servant accepting bribe. Besides, we have also decided to pay 2 per cent of the money to the person who helps recover it, he said.        
	Soon after December 2005 when the Nitish-led government was formed a similar policy was adopted and the state opened the special vigilance unit and strengthened the vigilance bureau. Till date, the bureau has nabbed 500 officials including IAS and IPS staff and engineers, a figure higher than what was in the past 20 years.        
	A close observation of the vikas yatra reveals that alongside the anti-corruption drive, anger is simmering among the bureaucratic ranks against Nitish Kumar for pitting the masses against the ruling elite. But, as the chief minister has been heard saying, either I will stay in power or corruption will.         
	People are the masters of the democracy. Learn to keep the government in your control rather than allowing them to control you, he has added.

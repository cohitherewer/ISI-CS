          G.S. MUDUR                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 5: A public-private initiative set up three years ago to bolster Indias capacity for public health education and research now plans to establish the countrys first public health university, unfettered from existing medical education rules.        
	The Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), launched in 2006 with joint funding from the Indian government and private Indian and foreign donors, plans to introduce Masters degrees and research programmes at the proposed university.        
	Although medical schools across India provide postgraduate programmes in community medicine and public health, their efforts have been constrained by medical education rules that do not permit non-medical professionals to serve as faculty.         
	But experts believe the inter-disciplinary nature of public health demands expertise from fields such as economics, social sciences and behavioural sciences.        
	Instead of doctors teaching doctors, at this university, we hope to develop a multi-disciplinary faculty teaching students from different backgrounds, K. Srinath Reddy, president of the PHFI, told The Telegraph.        
	The PHFI will establish its main campus at its Indian Institute of Public Health (IIPH), New Delhi, with additional campuses in Hyderabad and Gandhinagar. The foundation is also in talks for setting up campuses in several other states, including Bengal.        
	Each PHFI is expected to provide education on multiple aspects of public health, including disease prevention, health economics, ethics of healthcare, as well as conduct research to guide local, regional and national public health policies.        
	 The proposed two-year Masters programme will enrol 50 students each year.        
	While we expect medical graduates to apply, well also be open to accepting students whove studied economics, social sciences, or management, said Sanjay Zodpey, the director of public health education at the PHFI.         
	He said the foundation was currently exploring different mechanisms through which its public health university may begin functioning by the next academic year  starting September 2010.        
	The PHFI was launched in March 2006 with Rs 50 crore funding from the Indian government, and Rs 150 crore from various donors including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Ranbaxy, Deshpande Foundation, among others.        
	The initiative was conceived more than five years ago during a conversation between Rajat Gupta, then managing director of McKinsey and Co, and Barry Bloom, the former dean of the Harvard School of Public Health.

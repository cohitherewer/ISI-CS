The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Boycott pill for Gaza 
                                                                                                               Boycott pill for Gaza 
  - Muslim groups plan appeal to shun US products         CITHARA PAUL                           Protesters in Mumbai collect dupattas and bangles to be sent to consulates of Muslim countries for their silence on the Israeli attack on Palestine. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, Jan. 1: Several Muslim groups in the country are planning to take a cue from the Indonesian Ulema Council and appeal for a boycott of American products following the Israeli air strikes on Gaza.        
	But before that, they are trying to work out what constitutes an American product.         
	There are differences of opinion about what exactly are American products. Some argue that after globalisation, there is no such thing as 100 per cent American because most products are being made elsewhere, including in India. We need to have more clarity on these matters, a Muslim leader said.        
	However, he said, a boycott would serve as a symbolic protest against American imperialism.         
	The argument for a boycott call is that it will force the US to take immediate steps to force an end to the violence in Gaza.         
	A boycott call will make America sit up and take notice of the plight of innocent Palestinian women and children who are being killed. Since Israel will listen only to the US, we think this is the best strategy, said Ummar Illyasi of the All India Muslim Front.         
	The appeal will be not just to Muslims but all righteous Indians who are against American hegemony.         
	Its wrong to think that only Muslims are against the Israeli attack on Palestine. There are so many in the country who think that America has a role in the Israel-Palestine tussle, Illyasi said.         
	Moulana Abdul Hameed Noomani, a spokesperson for the Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind, the countrys largest Muslim organisation, said a call for boycott of American products would be its last tool. Boycott of products is a powerful tool and we will use it as our ultimate weapon, he said.         
	As an initial step, the Jamiat will hold demonstrations across the country demanding an immediate end to the Israeli strikes. A resolution condemning the attack will also be read out during Friday prayers tomorrow in all mosques across the country.        
	The Jamiat, which has sought New Delhis intervention, also plans to approach various embassies here and urge them to act.         
	T.A. Rehmani, of the Muslim Political Council of India, said a boycott should come out of personal conviction.        
	Hence, we are trying to spread awareness among the community about the impending danger of American imperialism and how a boycott can be used as a powerful tool.        
	If one realises that out of every Rs 10 one spends on an American product, Re 1 will go for making weapons to kill his brethren anywhere in the world, then any sensible person will stop buying American products, Rehmani said.

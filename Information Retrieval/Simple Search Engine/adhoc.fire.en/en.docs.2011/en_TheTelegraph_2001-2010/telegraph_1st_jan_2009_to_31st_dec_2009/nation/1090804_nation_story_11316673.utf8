The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Net your MPs unfamiliar face

          SANJAY K. JHA                                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 3: Hes a farmer from Uttar Pradesh who loves chess and squash and, when he isnt surfing the Net, is probably out scuba diving.        
	No, Mayavatis state hasnt turned Utopia yet  as Rahul Gandhi is so tireless in pointing out. Except that while describing himself in his Lok Sabha profile, the Amethi MP may just have conveyed a slightly different impression.        
	Rahul cites his profession as farmer and, under special interest, dutifully mentions promoting primary education, empowering Dalits, etc. He then cites his favourite pastimes: the Internet, music, chess, flying and reading.        
	What sports does he love? Cricket and football are given the cold shoulder and scuba diving, cycling, swimming, squash and target shooting get the nod.        
	The personal details on the House website, furnished by the members themselves, range from disarmingly candid to pretentious to bizarre.        
	If highbrow Congress MP Kishore Chandra Deo confesses his favourite pastimes are walking, cooking and astrology, BJP muscleman Ramakant Yadav, who won from Azamgarh thanks to communal polarisation, cites the protection of minorities as his special interest.        
	Sushma Swaraj may be eyeing a big role in national politics but her biggest distinction is having been the youngest cabinet minister in Haryana. Her medal of pride is a Limca Book of Records pat for her and husband Swaraj Kaushal who, she boasts, was Indias youngest governor.        
	Some members are hard to recognise. Meet the erudite Lalu Prasad, writer of articles on contemporary socio-political issues (when he is not participating in social, cultural, literary and artistic activities in academia). The RJD chief also loves reading about thinkers and revolutionaries.        
	If Maneka Gandhi has written 14 books, Mamata Banerjee has authored 17. The railway minister names all of them while mentioning  under the head Literary Artistic amp; Scientific Accomplishments  that she has also composed lyrics and set songs to music.        
	L.K. Advanis entries are a mirror to his mind, mentioning his arrest during the Emergency but not the one after the Babri demolition. In contrast, Murli Manohar Joshi duly mentions how he was arrested two days after the demolition and reveals his antipathy for multinationals, showing scant regard for the partys liberal economic policies.        
	Several BJP members have declared their religious agenda. While Dilip Singh Judeos special interest is preserving Hindu shrines and checking conversions, Hukumdeo Narain Yadavs main achievement is building temples  accomplished, of course, during times he could wrench himself away from his favourite sports: kabaddi and gilli-danda.        
	Some entries are a study in political correctness. Sonia Gandhi is a social worker, and takes a special interest in Indian handlooms and handicrafts; Indian contemporary, classical and tribal art; oil paintings and their conservation. And if you want to get into industrialist MP Naveen Jindals good books, show the uttermost respect towards the national flag.        
	The way to global cuisine connoisseur Jitin Prasadas heart lies obviously through his stomach, provided you are able to rustle up a nice ratatouille nicoise that doesnt taste like the swallows nest soup.        
	For brutal honesty, bow before the CPIs Gurudas Dasgupta. He confesses his favourite pastime is drama. Those who have seen him in prime form in the House will doubtless vouch for that.

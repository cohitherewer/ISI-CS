The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Word of mouth that won the West
                                                                                                               Word of mouth that won the West
          AMIT ROY                          Loveleen Tandan, co-director of Slumdog Millionaire, at one of the parties in Los Angeles after the Oscars event. Picture by Amit Roy                                  
	Los Angeles, Feb. 24: Slumdog Millionaire had a powerful advocate deep inside the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.        
	Of course, one man cannot influence the opinions of nearly 6,000 members of the Academy who were required to send in their ballot papers by 5pm on February 17, five days before the Oscar ceremony was due to start.        
	But when that man is Bob Friedman, a member of the executive branch of the academy, his recommendations are treated with respect. He triggered a word of mouth movement.        
	Although the balloting is secret, Friedmans fellow members appreciated that he wanted them to vote for Slumdog when he urged them to see this movie. In the language of LA folk who have had no life other than movie-making, they all understood the coded script.        
	As someone who has been a president of Columbia Pictures, a president of the United Artists Association and a president of AMC Theatres, his voice commanded respect. I am not allowed to tell people how they should vote, Friedman said. What I am allowed to do is tell people, See this movie.                        Bob Friedman      
	Friedman wanted Slumdog to win not because it is an Indian movie but because it is a great movie.        
	At a post-Oscar party last night, he confirmed to The Telegraph: When I saw the picture I knew right then the picture deserved to win not because it was Indian but because it was just a great movie at many levels, including romantic and exciting. The gentleman (quiz master) Anil Kapoor was brilliant the way he was moving for the kid and at other times looking to sabotage him. I thought the AC/DC sense of, I am with him, I am against him, was wonderful and outstanding. It is a memorable movie.        
	It did no harm that Friedman has spent time in India. I was involved in Gandhi  I was at Columbia Pictures when Columbia Pictures produced Gandhi. I know Richard Attenborough and he sent me some rushes in London, he said.        
	Returning to Slumdog, Friedman said he considered the film to be truthful and touching. It was almost a Romeo and Juliet story. He (Dev Patel) played the role so perfectly  the acting was great. This was a genuinely good film.        
	Friedman, who also serves in the foreign language department of the academy, said with the 81st Oscar over, this is Indias golden opportunity and shining moment with worldwide attention glowing on it to capitalise on this setting. There is a great similarity between India and the United States. India and the United States produce more films together than the rest of the world combined. India and the US are the most populated democracies in the world, Friedman said.        
	Meanwhile, the visit to Los Angeles by the Mumbai child actors is coming to an end. Yesterday, they were taken to Disneyland where they rubbed shoulders with Disney stars, including Mickey and Minnie Mouse.         
	As for Freida Pinto, she has left Los Angeles amid reports that she has been signed up by Woody Allen to work alongside Josh Brolin and Anthony Hopkins in his next film.         
	Dev Patel has reportedly signed up for M. Night Shyamalans The Last Airbender.

	Lancashire, Oct. 27: A man on the run from British justice has been arrested by chance in India and is facing extradition to serve a 15-year prison sentence for kidnapping.        
	Ajay Kaushal, 50, fled the UK when he was due to go on trial four years ago for kidnapping a Burnley businessman and securing a 100,000 ransom.        
	Kaushal, from Stretford, Manchester, was convicted in his absence at Preston Crown Court in January 2005 and received a 15-year sentence.        
	Authorities in Goa said that he was arrested by chance in Panaji after his friend, William Scott, 39, was found dead in a hotel room in the nearby village of Colva.         
	Police who investigated the death then uncovered Kaushals identity and previous conviction.        
	Deputy police superintendent Umesh Gaonkar said that Kaushal would be handed over to British police.         
	We found Kaushals identification documents on him, which helped us confirm his identity and corroborate it with Lancashire police, he said.        
	Kaushal is wanted by Lancashire Constabularys Serious and Organised Crime Unit.         
	Details of his crime are listed on the forces website.        
	A Lancashire Constabulary spokeswoman said: We are aware of the arrest and are liaising with the Crown Prosecution Service with a view to bringing him back to the UK, where he will be sent to jail.        
	In June 2003 the man was kidnapped from his home in Burnley and taken to a secret location in Manchester where he was beaten and tortured.         
	He was released when a ransom demand of 100,000, consisting of cash and jewellery, was paid.        
	Kaushal was charged with conspiracy to kidnap along with five other men from Manchester but failed to appear at his trial.         
	The other five were convicted and jailed.                    THE TIMES, LONDON

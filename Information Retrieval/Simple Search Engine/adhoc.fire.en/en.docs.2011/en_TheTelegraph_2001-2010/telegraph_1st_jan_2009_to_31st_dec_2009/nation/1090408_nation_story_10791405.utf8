	London, April 7: As P Chidambaram was the victim of a footwear throwing incident in India, a 27-year-old Cambridge student was appearing before magistrates court today after severely embarrassing the university by throwing a shoe at the visiting Chinese prime minister Wen Jiabao.        
	But in a development that is unusual, possibly even unprecedented, the proceedings of the court were adjusted to take into account Chinese political sensitivities.        
	German-born Martin Jahnke, a normally studious pathology researcher at Darwin College, was due to go on trial on June 2, 3 and 4 accused of having harassed, alarmed or distressed the Chinese premier in        
	Cambridge on February 2.        
	But magistrates in Cambridge today advanced the trial dates to June 1, 2 and 3 because June 4 is the 20th anniversary of Tiananmen Square massacre. It will be recalled that on June 4, 1989, several hundred civilians protesting in support of democracy in Tiananmen Square, in Beijing, were shot dead by the Chinese army.        
	This is probably the first time in British legal history that court dates have been adjusted to avoid giving offence to a foreign power.        
	But then at the G20 summit last week, China announced it would give the International Monetary Fund $40billion to bail out the west.        
	The prosecution counsel, Punam Malhan, told the court that staging the trial on the anniversary created concerns and security issues.        
	The courts legal advisor also told magistrates that June 4 would be a sensitive date.        
	The university, which has been building close links with China as it has been doing with India and has some 900 Chinese students, has not been inclined to dismiss the affair as a youthful prank.        
	The universitys vice-chancellor Alison Richard, who has sent a letter of apology to the Chinese premier (as has Gordon Brown), has said: I deeply regret that a single member of the audience failed to show the respect for our speaker that is customary at Cambridge. This university is a place for considered argument and debate, not for shoe-throwing.        
	Jahnke does not actually deny throwing the shoe, which landed short of its target, but he rejects the charges. Malhan told the court that the prosecution would call seven witnesses and magistrates heard that Jahnke might call four or five people in his own defence.        
	Applicants to attend Wens speech were vetted and security was tight but one university source today made a wry remark to The Telegraph: In future, we will have to take off peoples shoes.        
	Almost 2,000 students and members of staff applied for the 500 tickets available to hear the lecture entitled See China in the Light of Her Development. Wen was five minutes from finishing his 45-minute presentation when Jahnke stood up and threw the shoe as he made his political point, How can the University prostitute itself with this dictator here? and How can you listen to the lies hes telling?        
	To cries of Shame! and Get out! from students, many of them Chinese, he was bundled out by university proctors and then arrested by police on suspicion of breach of the peace and attempted assault.        
	The university has instituted its own internal separate proceedings against the alleged offender.        
	Meanwhile, Wen has sent a magnanimous message to the university asking that Jahnke should be given an opportunity to continue his studies. As a Chinese saying goes, it is more precious than gold for a young person to turn himself around to redress mistakes. It is hoped that this student will see his mistake and seek to understand a real and developing China.

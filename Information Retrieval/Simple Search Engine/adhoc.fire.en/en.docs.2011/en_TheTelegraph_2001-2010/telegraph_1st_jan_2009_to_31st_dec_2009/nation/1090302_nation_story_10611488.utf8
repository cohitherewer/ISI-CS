The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Defection blow to LJP, Lalu Prasad
                                                                                                               Defection blow to LJP, Lalu Prasad
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Ranjan Yadav at the function. Pictures by Deepak Kumar                                  
	Patna, March 1: In what may prove to be a major setback to the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) in particular, and the UPA in general, LJP senior vice-president Ranjan Yadav today joined the Janata Dal (United) in presence of chief minister Nitish Kumar and JD(U) chief Sharad Yadav.        
	Ranjan Yadavs move towards the NDA will prove to be a blow for RJD boss Lalu Prasad, too, as Nitish Kumar is set to pit the new entrant to the JD(U) against the railway minister in the Pataliputra Lok Sabha seat.        
	It is learnt that Lalu Prasad has been contemplating a move to contest the Yadav-dominated Pataliputra seat, besides Saran (old Chapra), that he represents in the Lok Sabha.         
	The railway minister may find it difficult when he gets locked in a poll battle against his former bosom friend and a fellow Yadav.        
	Ranjan Yadav earlier had formed the Yadav Jagaran Manch to split Yadavs with the RJD  as a result of which the manch merged with the JD(U).        
	I had joined the LJP bandwagon to help him in his battle to liberate Bihar from the Lalu-Rabri-sponsored jungle raaj. However, now it is evident that Paswan is on course to strike a friendship with Lalu Prasad. If that is the case then I have no business in the LJP, Ranjan Yadav said, praising chief minister Nitish Kumar for carrying out all-round development and restoring law in Bihar.        
	Nitish Kumar used todays occasion and platform  set up by the Yadav Jagaran Manch  to apprise a mainly-Yadav congregation of how the NDA government was executing an all-inclusive growth in the state.        
	I believe in observing raaj dharma (religion of state) that means taking care of all the sections of the society, Kumar said, adding: The state had 25 lakh drop outs when we came to power in December 2005. Today, the state has less than half of that number of children out of school. The chief minister dwelt at length on how his government had taken up special measures for the employment of the women and had ensured livelihood to the Mahadalits.        
	He ridiculed the railway minister who laid the foundation stones for approximately 36,000km worth of rural roads yesterday.         
	Rural roads are state subjects. How can a Union minister take responsibility for a state subject. However, this is election time and Lalu Prasad seems to be on a spree, he said, adding: Everyone knows that the Centre would not be ale to complete the work its ministers are promising to deliver, as the people will elect a new government in the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls.

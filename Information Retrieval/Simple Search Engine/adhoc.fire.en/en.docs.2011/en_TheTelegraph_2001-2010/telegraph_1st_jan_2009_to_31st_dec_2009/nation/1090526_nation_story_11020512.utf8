The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Low litchi yield, prices soar
                                                                                                               Low litchi yield, prices soar
                            
	Patna, May 25 (PTI): The production of Shahi litchi, particular to the state of Bihar, has been down by 50 per cent this season in Muzaffarpur, the district famous for the fruit, resulting in high market prices.        
	Every year, around 3 lakh tonne of litchi is produced in the district.         
	Unstable climate, inappropriate management of gardens and untimely fall of half-grown fruits due to rain and heat are being touted as the primary reasons for the low production, said senior scientist at the National Litchi Research Centre, Rajesh Kumar, who is posted at Muzaffarpur.        
	Scanty rainfall and scorching heat also affected the production of the export quality fruits, he added.        
	The volatile weather also aggravated fungal diseases that caused the flowers to drop leading to crop loss and to production dipping by 50 per cent, revealed the president of the Litchi Growers Association, Neeraj Chhinwalhe.        
	Shahi litchis, now in the nations markets, are costlier this season.         
	It is 20 to 30 per cent costlier in Muzaffarpur itself, and is being sold at Rs 30 to Rs 40 per kg in other parts of Bihar, a trader said. The rate is Rs 50 per kg in other parts of the country, which is unlikely to dip as the season proceeds, believes Chhinwalhe.        
	The Shahi variety is cultivated over 10,000 hectare in Muzaffarpur and has earned a name for itself not only in India, but also across the world.        
	Bihar ranks top in the production of litchis followed by Bengal, Uttrakhand and Jharkhand. The fruit is also grown in Assam, Tripura, Punjab and Haryana.        
	Kumar said, given the vast area over which litchi cultivation is carried out, Bihar should ideally be able to grow 4-4.5 lakh tonne of the fruit every season. But, it is unfortunate that Bihar is content with a production that is little over 3 lakh tonne every season, he said.        
	Usually for a better yield, farmers should ideally irrigate gardens properly, use quality fertilisers and insecticides, added the senior scientist. But, that is not always the case.        
	In Bihar, Shahi and China varieties are produced in Muzaffarpur, Samastipur, Vaishali, East and West Champaran, Begusarai, Katihar, Purnia and Bhagalpur.

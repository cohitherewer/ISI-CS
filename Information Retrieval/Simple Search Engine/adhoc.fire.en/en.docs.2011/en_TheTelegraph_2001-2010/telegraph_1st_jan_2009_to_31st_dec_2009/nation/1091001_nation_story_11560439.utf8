The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lobbying on for education watchdog berths
                                                                                                               Lobbying on for education watchdog berths
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 30: Leading academicians have started lobbying for top posts in Indias proposed overarching higher education watchdog even before its birth, exposing what some officials and academicians are dubbing a typical scramble for post-retirement slots.         
	The academicians have applied to the human resource development ministry for membership in the unborn National Commission for Higher Education and Research (NCHER), risking allegations of conflict of interest and pure desperation.         
	Leading the race is professor Vijay Khole, who was a member of the Yash Pal panel on higher education that proposed the NCHER to end nepotism and inbreeding that plague Indian higher education.         
	Khole recently ended his tenure as vice-chancellor of the University of Mumbai.         
	I am shocked. Kholes application is a clear case of conflict of interest. This is unfortunate and disgusting, said a senior academician, who was also on the Yash Pal panel, speaking on the condition of anonymity.         
	An HRD ministry source clarified that while Khole had not broken any law or rule by applying for a post at the regulator he proposed, the academicians move was surprising and smacked of unbridled desperation.         
	It does not require a law for the countrys brightest academicians to know that it is improper for them to lobby for a post created because of their supposed vision to end nepotism in academics, the source said.         
	What has irked sections of the government is the manner in which Khole is lobbying.         
	Khole has persuaded former Maharashtra chief minister and current Union minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, Mumbai MP Gurudas Kamat and chief information commission Wajahat Habibullah to recommend his nomination to the new body, documents accessed by The Telegraph show.         
	Deshmukh, Kamat and Habibullah have all written to HRD minister Kapil Sibal recommending that Khole be appointed member of the still-to-be-born agency.         
	Khole argued that there was nothing wrong in applying for the membership despite his presence on the Yash Pal panel.         
	As someone who knows the rationale behind creating the NCHER (because of membership on the Yash Pal panel), and its nitty-gritty, I think I am better equipped than many others for the post of a member in the commission, Khole told The Telegraph from Mumbai.         
	A senior faculty member at the Cochin University for Science and Technology has also applied to the HRD ministry for the post of chairman of the proposed body.         
	Another senior academician also applied, attaching his vision as the prospective chairman of the NCHER.         
	The situation is akin to people lining up to adopt a baby that is yet to be born, an HRD ministry official said.         
	But the flow of applications for the proposed regulator  that will subsume all current higher education regulators like the University Grants Commission  reflects a deeper malaise afflicting Indian higher education, officials argue.         
	Applicants for the posts of vice-chancellor  eminent academicians on paper  routinely queue up outside the offices of relevant bureaucrats to lobby.         
	Of course, once they become vice-chancellors, many of them start crying for autonomy  till they want a second term, an official said.

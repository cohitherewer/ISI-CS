The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | NCP silences merger buzz
                                                                                                               NCP silences merger buzz
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, June 15: The Nationalist Congress Party today declared it would retain and build its independent identity, dismissing allegations of cracks within its leadership over returning to the Congress 10 years after breaking away.        
	Under pressure from a Congress lobby to merge with the parent party, the NCPs working committee, headed by party chief Sharad Pawar, today unanimously decided to pursue an independent existence, party leaders said.        
	All the leaders were of the view that the NCP must maintain its independent identity and build on the work we began 10 years back, party general secretary Devi Prasad Tripathi said.        
	The statement is aimed at assuring party workers that the NCP has no plans to merge with the Congress, top sources said. It is also a message to the Congress to stop day-dreaming about a merger at present, a senior leader added.        
	Although party sources accepted that the NCPs ties with the Congress were strained, they hinted they did not want to be seen as responsible for any rupture in the alliance.        
	Asked about the NCPs strategy for the upcoming Maharashtra polls, Tripathi said the working committee had decided to fight the elections in alliance with the Congress.        
	Over the past one month, some senior Congress leaders have questioned the rationale for the NCPs separate existence on the ground that the issue for the split  that Sonia Gandhis foreign descent made her unfit to lead the Congress  was now dead. Others have suggested the Congress fight the Maharashtra polls alone.        
	The Congress has increased its Lok Sabha tally from 145 in 2004 to 206, including a rise in Maharashtra, from 14 to 17. The NCP tally has fallen from nine to eight, and the party has suffered losses in its western Maharashtra stronghold.        
	Pawars party has also witnessed the embarrassing arrest of senior leader and Osmanabad MP Padamsinh Patil for the alleged murder of his cousin, Congress member Pawanraje Nimbalkar.        
	Also Purno Sangma, one of the partys co-founders, has left the leadership red-faced by apologising to Sonia for having once opposed her leadership. His change of heart came after the Congress inducted his daughter Agatha into the Union ministry last month.        
	By apologising to Sonia for opposing her, Sangma has effectively accepted that the NCP no longer has a rationale for independent existence, several top NCP leaders have privately said. Late last week, the party removed Sangmas son Conrad as its youth wing president without informing him. The slight is being seen as punishment for his father embarrassing the party.

	Aug. 6: A 21-year-old who tested positive for swine flu was reported missing from Jamshedpur since last night, spreading panic among residents and triggering contradictory claims by the administration which eventually said he was in a safe house.        
	Health officials had initially said Gopal Tiwary fled to Calcutta, apparently to leave for Singapore. But when he couldnt be traced, officials claimed he had been quarantined in an undisclosed location.        
	Immigration officials at Calcutta airport confirmed receiving a lookout notice for Tiwary. But he didnt turn up, said one official.

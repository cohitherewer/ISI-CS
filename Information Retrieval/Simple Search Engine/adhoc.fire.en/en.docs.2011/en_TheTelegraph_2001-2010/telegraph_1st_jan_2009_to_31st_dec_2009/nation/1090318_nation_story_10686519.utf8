The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ticket snub to Rajya Sabha MPs
                                                                                                               Ticket snub to Rajya Sabha MPs
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 17: The Congress has decided not to give tickets to its Rajya Sabha MPs who want to contest the Lok Sabha elections.        
	Former Karnataka chief minister S.M. Krishna was the first to approach the high command with such a request, though several MPs privately expressed their wish to cross over from the upper House to the lower House to legitimise their standing through a direct election.        
	Krishna was elected to the Rajya Sabha last year. But after the Congresss rout in the Assembly elections last summer and its poor showing in his erstwhile strongholds in the Mandya-Mysore region, his stature as a leader of the dominant Vokkaliga community came into question.         
	Krishna, sources said, couldnt bear the sight of H.D. Deve Gowda and his son, former chief minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, appropriating the Vokkaliga turf.         
	He wanted to prove a point by contesting the Lok Sabha polls. If he won, he could have reclaimed his supposed pre-eminence, a source said. But the Congress brass reportedly took a dim view of his aspirations and felt that he had been rewarded adequately with a Rajya Sabha berth.        
	In 2004, when some Rajya Sabha MPs walked away with plum ministries  Shivraj Patil, Arjun Singh and H.R. Bharadwaj were among the recipients, apart from Manmohan Singh  murmurs were heard of how Lok Sabha MPs who had earned their spurs in hard-fought battles were overlooked.        
	Other upper House members wanting to contest include Ambika Soni, Patil, Anand Sharma and B.K. Hariprasad.

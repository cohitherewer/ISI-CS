          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Srinagar, March 23: Four jawans and five militants died as the gunfight between security forces and the rebels in the forests of Kupwara raged into the fourth day, taking the toll to 19.        
	The dead include eight armymen, including a gallantry award winner, Major Mohit Sharma.        
	The exchange of fire continues, defence spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel J.S. Brar said.         
	Four soldiers and five militants were killed today, the army said, the highest number killed in a single firefight between militants and Indian troops in the Kashmir Valley in the past year.        
	The clash broke out on Friday after the army was tipped off about the presence of militants in Drangyari Chowkibal. The area was cordoned off and three rebels were killed in the ensuing encounter.        
	The theatre shifted to Tangdhar in adjoining Karnah on Saturday where one militant was killed in a shootout.        
	Soldiers and militants later faced off in the Hafrada forests. We dont know how many militants are inside because it is a huge area where several operations are being conducted, Brar said.        
	Police sources said the militants involved in the encounter could be from one large group that dispersed in several directions.        
	This could be a new group that has infiltrated (from across the Line of Control) very recently, a source said.

	Dec. 22: The Congress leadership today came up with a three-point proposal to solve the Telangana crisis.        
	At a meeting in Delhi with party MPs from coastal regions of Andhra, sources said central leaders had proposed setting up regional committees to debate the pros and cons of bifurcating the state.        
	The leaders also suggested forming an all-party committee to discuss the issue. If neither proposal is accepted, the third suggestion was to move a resolution in the Assembly. Sources said the Centre could issue a statement tomorrow to bring down the political temperature in the state.        
	In Andhra, Telangana Rashtra Samiti chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao said all the 100-odd legislators from the region would resign if there was further delay in the process of carving out a Telangana state.        
	TRS activists stalled a film shoot of actor Manoj Kumar on Hyderabads outskirts. Kumars father, Mohan Babu, president of the Movie Artistes Association, had supported the United Andhra campaign. Thank the stars, our activists didnt attack the actor, Rao said.

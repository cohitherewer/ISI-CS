                                                                                                               Royal flavour on poll trail
          GAJINDER SINGH                            Harsimrat, Raninder                          
	Chandigarh, April 4: As campaigns go, this ones turning out to be blue-blooded.        
	Royals from across the continent are trooping in to lend a helping hand to yuvraj Raninder Singh, a scion of the Patiala royal family and Congress candidate from Bathinda, Punjab.        
	The state unit, which launched the partys campaign today at a rally led by Raninders father and former chief minister Amarinder Singh, has drawn up a list of more than two dozen royals who will hit the dusty poll tracks soon.        
	One of them, from across the Himalayas, has already arrived  Jigme Wangdi Wangchuk, the uncle of Bhutans crown prince Dasho Jigme Khesar Namgyal Wangchuk.        
	This time, we will be getting blue-blooded supporters from all over the world to canvass for us, a senior Congress leader said, as swanky SUVs, among the dozens that have suddenly flooded Bathinda, whizzed past.        
	We would be keeping a close watch on their activities to see if they are spending money beyond what candidates have been entitled to by the Election Commission, a spokesperson for the ruling Akali Dal said.        
	The move to invite royals has drawn charges of feudalism from Raninders rival Harsimrat Kaur, daughter-in-law of chief minister Parkash Singh Badal.        
	In a statement, Harsimrat slammed the feudal tendencies of the Congress and said the party was under the false impression that former kings and queens could fetch them votes.        
	While Raninder is campaigning against what he calls increasing corruption under the states Shiromani Akali Dal-BJP government, Harsimrat  whose husband Sukhbir Singh Badal is Punjabs deputy chief minister  is focussing on female foeticide and growing drug addiction.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lalu to lose office to Maya
                                                                                                               Lalu to lose office to Maya
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                          Lalu Prasad                                  
	New Delhi, July 9: Lalu Prasads party is facing the possibility of losing its office in Parliament to Mayavatis group, the fear of displacement coming close on the heels of uncertainty over the Bihar leaders seating arrangement in the Lok Sabha.        
	Early this week, a notification was issued allotting the third-floor office to the BSP. Soon, some BSP members visited their would-be office to consider changes in the interiors, catching RJD MPs by surprise.        
	They were looking at the walls, perhaps thinking where the portrait of Mayavati will be placed, a senior RJD leader said. For now though, portraits of Lalu Prasad and a smiling Rabri Devi adorn the office wall.The room used to be occupied by the Lok Sabha secretariat before it was allotted to the RJD during the previous term. Earlier, the RJD had a small room on the ground floor of Parliament House.        
	Like in case of the seating arrangement in the Lok Sabha, where Lalu Prasad is hoping to be seated in the treasury benches in the first row although his party does not have the requisite number of MPs now, the RJD is clinging to hopes that the Congress may intervene to help it retain the office.        
	A party needs eight Lok Sabha MPs to have an office on the Parliament premises  Lalu Prasad has just four. You see, we have eight seats together in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. So, may be, we will still retain it, a leader said.         
	Mayavati has 21 seats and is not known to giving up what is rightfully hers. But the BSP members have not re-visited the RJD office in four days.        
	Worse for Lalu Prasad, arch rival Janata Dal (United) with 20 seats may be getting an office bigger than the one it occupies close to the Central Hall on the ground floor.        
	Party offices in Parliament are spread over all floors but those on the first floor are the most sought after. An office earlier held by the Telugu Desam Party is now the fortress of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam.

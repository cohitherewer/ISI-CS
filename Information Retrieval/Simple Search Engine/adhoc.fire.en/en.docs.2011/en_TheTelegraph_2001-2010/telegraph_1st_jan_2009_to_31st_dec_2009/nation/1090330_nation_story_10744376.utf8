  - Festival blast triggers chain of explosions in Ganjam          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Bhubaneswar, March 29: Four persons died and 15 were injured when a crude bomb exploded at a village in Ganjam district during the small hours today.        
	Many of those injured included villagers who had gathered to watch local festival Danda Nachcha at Nuapalli village in Purushotampur block, about 200km from here.        
	The light operator of the festival died on the spot while three people in the audience, including a woman and her child, were also killed.        
	The festival was organised in front of the house of one Padmacharan Pradhan, where crude bombs were kept in cartons.         
	One of the bombs went off, triggering explosions in other cartons containing finished bombs, leading to a larger blast in the area, police said.         
	The high intensity blast led to the collapse of the entire building, besides damaging the nearby houses.        
	The explosives were being put together at Pradhans house for the past few days. Pradhan, along with four others, was apparently making the bombs to use against some people he had dispute with at a nearby village. Pradhan, after a tiff at his previous village, had moved to Nuapalli along with his family only a couple of months ago.         
	While two persons engaged in bomb making were admitted to the hospital with serious burns, two others escaped. Four persons have been arrested in connection with the incident. We have requested bomb disposal squads to check the remaining bombs from exploding, said Ganjam superintendent of police Nitinjit Singh.        
	The injured persons have been rushed to the MKCG Medical College.         
	Six persons are stated to be in critical condition.

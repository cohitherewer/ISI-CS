  - CPM LOSES REFERENDUM ELECTION IN KERALA BUT SEES SLIDE BOTTOMING OUT          JOHN MARY                                                  
	Thiruvananthapuram, Nov. 10: Blanked out in Bengal and Kerala, the CPM today sought refuge in statistics to suggest that that its slide had bottomed out in the southern state.         
	The Congress retained three Assembly seats in Kerala, the results a setback for chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan, who had termed the byelections a referendum for the CPM-led Left Democratic Front government.        
	Achuthanandan made a fig leaf out of the numbers, arguing that the Congress had failed to maintain its Assembly segment leads in the Lok Sabha elections six months ago in spite of winning 3-0 today.         
	This, he claimed, was evidence that the Left had been able to shore up support and take the message of good governance to the people.         
	The same statistics boomeranged on Achuthanandan as the CPM was found to be trailing in a milestone panchayat which precedes the worlds first elected communist government.        
	For the first time in its electoral history, the CPM trailed, by some 200 votes, in Chirakkal panchayat in Kannur town. Chirakkal elected the communist-led panchayat committee to power in 1956, a year before the first Communist government under EMS Namboodiripad was voted in.         
	A.P. Abdulla Kutty, a two-term MP of the CPM who was expelled from the party for praising Narendra Modis development agenda, rubbed salt in the Lefts wounds by winning from Kannur.         
	Kutty, who had switched over to the Congress, won by 12,043 votes, more than the 8,000-margin registered in 2006. He garnered 50.96 per cent of the votes, a shade lower than the 51.1 per cent secured by the Congress in 2006.        
	In Ernakulam, former fisheries minister Dominic Presentation defeated P.M. Sinulal, his share rising from 49.72 per cent in 2006 to 49.93 per cent this time. The CPM saw a dip, from 43.04 per cent in 2006 to 40.6 per cent.        
	But in Alappuzha, the Congresss A.A. Shukkoor won by only 4,745 votes.         
	The partys share slipped, from 58.59 per cent in 2006 to 49.96 per cent.

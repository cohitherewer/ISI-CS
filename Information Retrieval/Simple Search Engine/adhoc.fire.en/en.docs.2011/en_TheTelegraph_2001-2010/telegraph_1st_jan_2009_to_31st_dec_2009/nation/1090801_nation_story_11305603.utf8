          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, July 31: A raid conducted at a house in Naranpur under Naugaon police station area has led to the discovery of two skeletons.        
	Acting on a missing complaint, police searched the house of Cuttack-born Gujarat resident Jayant Mohanty, while trying to track his tenant, Biranchi Sahoo, and his family.         
	Biranchi, a mason, reportedly lived there with wife Laxmi and daughter Namita, 8. Laxmis father Surendra Bastia, who had not heard from his daughter for two months, travelled to Naranpur a few days ago to find Biranchis rented quarters locked. He then went to his son-in-laws native village in Narsinghpur after neighbours said Biranchi had left two months ago to visit an ailing uncle. 
    After failing to trace the three, Surendra lodged a complaint at Nuagaon police station and a team raided the house yesterday in presence of a magistrate. They found the main room in a mess with a portion of the floor dug up and covered with cow dung. On clearing the area, the skeletal remains were found.
    
	Police suspect that the remains belong to the mother and the daughter.
  ldquo;We are waiting for the forensic reports and efforts are on to trace Biranchi, rdquo; said Brajabandhu Baral, the Nuagaon inspector in charge.

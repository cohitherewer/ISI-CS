          NALIN VERMA                               
	Patna, June 4: The departure of Lalu Prasad loyalist and RJDs face for the Extremely Backward Class (EBC) Bhim Singh to the JD(U) is believed to be the first sign of a scramble to switch over to the winning side before the 2010 Assembly polls.        
	Before Bhim Singh, it was senior leader and former Barh MP Vijay Krishna who deserted RJD to join JD(U). Krishna had defeated Nitish Kumar on the Barh Lok Sabha seat in 2004.         
	Rumour mills say that the RJD has decided to impose strong anti-defection law on legislators who are thinking on the same lines as Krishna and Singh.         
	The RJD that has 54 MLAs in the Assembly succeeded in leading only in 33 Assembly segments out of the total 243 segments  as many as 19 RJD MLAs witnessed defeat in their respective segments. RJDs ally, LJP, managed to get a lead in five Assembly seats, while Congress led in 10 segments despite recording a 6 per cent rise in its vote share.         
	Contrary to the Opposition, the JD(U) with 88 MLAs established a lead in as many as 110 Assembly segments and BJP (55 MLAs) led in 66. Thus, the JD(U)-BJP combination led in 176 Assembly segments out of the 243, suggesting that the combination was way ahead of its rivals.         
	If the Lok Sabha poll results are considered as a parameter, the JD(U)-BJP combination is all set to run away with 176 seats against 133 it won in 2005.        
	Political observers do not find any reason for the voters  particularly EBCs and Muslims  to change their minds by next year, given the preparations that Nitish Kumar is taking.         
	Nitish has decided to resume his vikas yatra from June 6, which he had suspended after the enforcement of electoral code of conduct. The yatra, in course of which he directly interacted with the masses and organised cabinet meets in hinterlands, is said to have worked wonders for the NDA.        
	The only thing that may change the poll trend is significant changes in the political set up. For instance, if the JD(U) leaves the BJP to tie-up with the Congress before the Assembly polls, the results, it is believed, may be different.        
	Or, if the Congress that contested separately in the just-concluded Lok Sabha polls befriends Lalu Prasad again, it may shake up things a bit.         
	As of now, the RJD finds itself hard to come out of the quagmire with poll statistics heavily loaded against Lalu Prasad.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Roy: Cold sweat                                  
	Mumbai, Feb. 5: Bombay High Court today quashed the appointment of Anami Roy as Maharashtra police chief, saying the process of his selection was arbitrary, against principles of equality and Supreme Court guidelines.        
	The state government should find a new director-general of police within four weeks, a division bench of Chief Justice Swatanter Kumar and Justice S.A. Bobde said.        
	Roy can continue in office till his successor is named.        
	In appointing Roy a year back, the then Vilasrao Deshmukh government had overlooked three officers senior to him without explanations. One of the officers moved the Central Administrative Tribunal, which set aside Roys appointment. Roy and the government then challenged the tribunals order.        
	Today, the court specified that its judgment did not reflect on the merit of Roy or the other officers in the fray, but was a ruling against the arbitrary process followed.        
	Selecting Roy for the post, then deputy chief minister R.R. Patil had noted that the 1972-batch IPS officer should be appointed DGP in order to maintain law and order.        
	The court said that could hardly be a ground to exclude the other three officers and showed non-application of mind by the deputy chief minister. It pointed out that irrelevant considerations had been taken into account while ignoring the relevant parameters. Patil had quit after the Mumbai attacks last November.        
	(The) decision-making process was taken in undue haste... it was not in conformity with the administrative norms. The (appointment) order is arbitrary and violative of Articles 14 and 16 (right to equality) of the Constitution, the bench said in its 119-page order.        
	The judges cited guidelines for such appointments set by the Supreme Court in an earlier case, saying it was mandatory to set up a panel of eligible officers from which one can be picked. No such shortlist was drawn up in Roys case, the bench said.        
	The judges didnt uphold the grounds on which the tribunal had quashed Roys appointment, though both reached the same conclusion. The tribunal had focused on the fact that S.S. Virk, the senior-most of the three contenders, had been passed over.         
	Suprakash Chakravarti, who had moved the tribunal, and J.D. Veerkar were the other two contenders.

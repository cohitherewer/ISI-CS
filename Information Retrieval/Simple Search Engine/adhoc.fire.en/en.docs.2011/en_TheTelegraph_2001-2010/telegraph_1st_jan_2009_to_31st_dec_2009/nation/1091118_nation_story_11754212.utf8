          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 17: The National Commission for Women (NCW) has exonerated two Air India pilots accused of sexually harassing an airhostess, saying that while the complainant was pushed by one of the pilots, she was not molested.        
	In a report submitted to the women and child development ministry today, the NCW has said that the complainant, Komal Singh, was pushed by the flight captain following a mid-air scuffle.        
	Singh had accused Captain Ranbir Arora and co-pilot Aditya Chopra of molesting her during a flight from Sharjah to Delhi on IC-BB4 over a month back. She had first approached the NCW on October 5.        
	There was no molestation of the airhostess by the pilot, though she was pushed, said Wansuk Syiem, an NCW member and head of the five-member team set up by the commission to examine Singhs allegations.        
	The NCW has recommended that Air India be asked to withdraw a chargesheet the airline had filed against Singh.        
	The airhostess had alleged that she was molested when she tried to intervene during an on-flight argument between flight purser Amit Khanna  who she has acknowledged as a friend  and the pilots. But Air India accused Singh of lying.

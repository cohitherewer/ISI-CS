          OUR BUREAU                              
	Dec. 22: An army court of inquiry convened in Calcutta has recommended action against four generals, including a principal staff officer (PSO) to the army chief, over an alleged land scam in north Bengal.        
	Earlier this month, defence minister A.K. Antony had told Parliament: A court of inquiry is in progress to investigate the circumstances under which no-objection certificate (NOC) was given and a memorandum of understanding signed for state land in Chumta Tea Estate in Sukna, Darjeeling. An army headquarters source in Delhi said: The findings of the inquiry have not yet reached us and no decision has been taken so far.        
	But a senior officer in Calcutta said strong action had been recommended against military secretary Lt General Avadhesh Prakash, former deputy army chief-designate Lt General P.K. Rath, corps commander Lt General Ramesh Halgalli and Major General P.C. Sen, who is with the Sukna-headquartered 33 Corps.        
	The army headquarters is extremely touchy about the issue and its spokesmen say the action has to be taken at the level of the Eastern Army Commander. Last fortnight, Lt General Prakashs lawyer sent defamation notices to two newspapers that reported that he had been indicted by the court of inquiry.        
	But the source in Calcutta today said it had been recommended that one of the generals should be dismissed from service for being associated with a businessman who was acquiring land that was adjacent to a military station and had been leased by the Bengal government to a tea estate.        
	Evidence to court martial two other generals may now be gathered. Administrative action has been recommended against a fourth general. Disciplinary proceedings against a colonel and a separate inquiry into the actions of another colonel have been also recommended. The findings and the recommendations of the court of inquiry and the Eastern Army Command have to be confirmed by army chief General Deepak Kapoor before they are implemented.        
	If the court has found the officers guilty and the recommendations are confirmed, the military secretary, one of eight PSOs to the army chief, would be the senior-most officer to be punished. The military secretary is responsible for all personnel management, transfers and postings and is member-secretary of the promotion board for major generals and lieutenant generals. The inquiry was ordered after the 33 Corps in Sukna flouted army rules to give an NOC to businessmen who proposed to build a Rs 300-crore school, ostensibly affiliated to Ajmers Mayo College, on 70 acres adjacent to the military station. Subsequently, the NOC was withdrawn.         
	Siliguri realtor Dilip Agarwal had formed a trust and applied for the NOC. The army reportedly refused in 2008 citing security but, sources said, gave the nod in February this year.

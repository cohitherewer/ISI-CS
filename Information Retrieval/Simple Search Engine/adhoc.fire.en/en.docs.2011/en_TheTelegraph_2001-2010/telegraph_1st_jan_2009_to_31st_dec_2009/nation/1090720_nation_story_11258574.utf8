The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Plan afoot to nudge BHU 
                                                                                                               Plan afoot to nudge BHU 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, July 19: The human resource development ministry plans to shoot from the law ministrys shoulders to scuttle demands placed by the Banaras Hindu University in exchange for losing its engineering wing.        
	Caught between political pressures and these demands, which it considers unreasonable, the HRD ministry is relying on the law to persuade the BHU to snap its ties with its engineering wing for its promised conversion into an IIT.        
	The BHU wants its Institute of Technology (IT-BHU) to remain an integral part of the university, a demand the HRD ministry is placing before the law ministry, senior officials told The Telegraph.        
	Hopefully, if the law ministry concurs with us, our hands will be strengthened in convincing the BHU that its demand is unreasonable, a senior HRD ministry official said.        
	IT-BHU students post-2006 argue that they joined the institute because of the promise to convert it into an IIT. But the BHU community is split, with several members opposed to losing the engineering wing, which is today the universitys most sought after department.        
	Under the IIT Act, which governs Indias premier engineering schools, IITs need to be independent institutions and cannot be structurally conjoined to any other institution or university.        
	Towards the end of its first term, the UPA government had shelved the IT-BHU conversion plan and focused on starting eight new IITs. With the new institutes now launched, the HRD ministry is under pressure to take another look at the IT-BHU conversion promise.        
	Failure to meet the assurance by the 2012 Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls may prove embarrassing for the Congress-led government, but HRD ministry officials are up against conditions set by the BHU that they find unacceptable.        
	The BHU executive council has resolved that while it supports the conversion plan, it wants the new institute named IIT-BHU and not IIT Banaras as it would normally have been named.         
	It also wants the BHU vice-chancellor appointed chairman of the converted IITs board of governors so it can retain control over the institutes policies.        
	IT-BHU had first been picked with six other institutions, including the Bengal Engineering and Science University (Besu), during the NDAs rule for conversion into IITs.         
	But an expert panel said IT-BHU alone deserved the tag and recommended a new category  Indian Institute of Engineering, Science and Technology  for Besu and the Cochin University for Science and Technology. Later, the UPA repeated the promise to IT-BHU.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, May 25: Three masked men brandishing revolvers today barged into Air Indias cargo booking terminal at Mumbai airport and left with a huge consignment of gold and silver coins worth an estimated Rs 55 lakh. While escaping, they ran the security guard over with their car.        
	The consignment was from National Refinery, a gold refinery unit, and was being sent to Hyderabad. Police said the three robbers entered the terminal around 11.30am and hit refinery official Dilip Borkar with a revolver butt. Other refinery officials were held at gunpoint.        
	The trio loaded four of the six trunks, containing 96-100kg of gold and silver coins, into a waiting car that had a fourth, masked man at the wheel. When the guard on duty, D.S. Bhosale, tried to stop them, the car rammed into him and dragged him for a few metres. Bhosale later died of his head injuries.        
	An Air India spokesperson denied earlier reports that the robbers had fired inside the cargo terminal at the domestic airport.        
	Deputy commissioner of police Nisar Tamboli said: The exact value of the consignment is being determined. We can give more details after investigations are complete.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CBI call after fudge cry in Shopian case
                                                                                                               CBI call after fudge cry in Shopian case
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Srinagar, Aug. 12: The Omar Abdullah government today announced it would hand over the Shopian rape-and-murder probe to the CBI after consulting the high court, which is monitoring the case.        
	The move follows an outcry over the alleged fudging of the two victims DNA samples, as suggested by a central forensic report yesterday.        
	The government has decided to hand over the Shopian case to the CBI after consulting the high court. I think this should meet the (demand of) the Opposition benches, finance minister Abdul Rahim Rather said in the Assembly.         
	But several members of Omars National Conference (NC), too, demanded that the CBI be brought in. We cannot trust (an) agency (Jammu and Kashmir police) whose own people are accused of the heinous crime. The case should be handed over to the CBI, NC legislator Saifullah Mir said.        
	Jammu and Kashmir High Court had ordered the arrest of the Shopian police chief and three other officers and said their DNA samples should be matched with the sperms found in the victims vaginal swabs.        
	But another twist was added to the case yesterday when Delhis Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) sent its report to the state government saying the vaginal swabs didnt match their victims blood and viscera samples.        
	It implies the swabs sent to the CFSL were not of the two victims but of somebody else. The government now wants the CBI to find out how that happened and who is responsible, a senior officer said.        
	The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which has kept the issue on the boil, accused the government of hushing up the case.        
	There is no progress in the case and government is trying to hush it up from Day One, PDP president Mehbooba Mufti said amid a ruckus by party members that forced Speaker Mohammad Akbar Lone to suspend the question hour for a debate.        
	Sources said the government, under fire for its handling of the case, decided to get the CBI in fearing reports of the alleged fudging that could give the Opposition more ammunition.        
	But the action didnt seem to have doused the fire. The PDP dubbed the move to get in the CBI a cover-up bid. The Kashmir Bar Association, which filed the public interest plea that led to the high court action, also rejected the CBI probe and demanded a judicial inquiry monitored by the court.         
	How can we trust an agency (CBI) which sabotaged the probe into (the) sex scandal (of 2006), bar general secretary G.N. Shaheen said.        
	The CBI probe into the scandal, allegedly involving politicians, bureaucrats and police officers, had been criticised as an eyewash, with claims that many of the bigwigs had been let off.         
	Last month, Omar had quit  only to take back his resignation days later  in a dramatic turn of events triggered by a PDP legislators remark that the chief minister was among those named in the CBI report. The Centre denied the claim.

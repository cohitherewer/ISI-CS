          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 11: The Supreme Court has frowned on courts practice of depositing with their free legal aid cells the costs recovered from litigants.        
	It has said the money is a kind of compensation and should go to the other side in the case that has been affected by the litigation.        
	It also said such damages should not be awarded in cases where no fraud, misrepresentation or suppression of facts had been proved.         
	Such penalties should go to the legal aid cells (for the poor) only if the side opposing the petitioner fails to appear in court, the apex court said.        
	It dismissed a Rs 50,000 penalty imposed by Allahabad High Court on a petitioner, Satyapal Singh.

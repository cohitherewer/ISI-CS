                                                                                                               Thackeray snub to Advani
                            
	Mumbai, Feb. 24 (PTI): Bal Thackeray today reportedly refused to meet L.K. Advani who had come to Mumbai for an event. The Shiv Sena said the BJP had wanted a meeting of the two leaders at short notice, which Thackerays party did not think was possible.         
	The reported refusal comes at a time relations between the two oldest partners in the NDA are under strain.

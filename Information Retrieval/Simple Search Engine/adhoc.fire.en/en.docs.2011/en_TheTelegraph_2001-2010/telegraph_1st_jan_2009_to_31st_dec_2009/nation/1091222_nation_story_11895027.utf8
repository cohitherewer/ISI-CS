The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Vanish MP back in auto
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Vanish MP back in auto
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, Dec. 21: Last seen speeding off in an SUV, Congress MP L. Rajagopal triggered a massive manhunt by a red-faced police force and the suspension of several officers, only to outfox them and emerge 14 hours later in the heart of the state capital, riding an autorickshaw.        
	The fasting Rajagopal, 45, who gave the police the slip around 11pm yesterday while being transferred from one hospital to another in Vijayawada, resurfaced in filmi fashion at 1.30 this afternoon, riding into the Nizams Institute of Medical Sciences in Hyderabad in an auto and checking into the ICU.        
	As the city braced for another phase of agitation following Rajagopals arrival, the Centre held out hope of a settlement.        
	In New Delhi, Congress MP K. Sambasiv Rao said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had promised a decision by tomorrow to bring everything in order in Andhra Pradesh.        
	Rao, who was part of a delegation of 10 MPs from Rayalaseema and coastal Andhra that met Singh today, said the Centre wanted to have a re-look at the problems of all three regions.        
	It is possible only through revival of the regional committees to look into irrigation, health, education, social welfare, agriculture and industrial development of all three regions once again, he said.         
	The move could help buy peace in the three regions, especially coastal Andhra Pradesh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Order on assets of JD-U leader 
                                                                                                               Order on assets of JD-U leader 
                            
	Patna, June 15 (PTI): A Patna court today ordered the attachment of property owned by absconding JD(U) leader Vijay Krishna and his son, Chanakya, alias Guddu, in connection with the abduction-cum-murder of Krishnas aide, Satyendra Singh.        
	Acting chief judicial magistrate Shailendra Kumar issued the order to attach their property after the father and son, key suspects in the case, failed to surrender either before the local court and police.        
	Earlier, the police had raided the houses of Krishna and his son in New Delhi and Patna a couple of days ago, but failed to trace the two, official sources said.        
	Krishna, a former MP, was earlier with the RJD and had joined the JD(U) just before the recent Lok Sabha elections.        
	The father and son, the key suspects, are absconding since the abduction case came into limelight.        
	Twenty days after his abduction on May 23, divers of the Indian Navy had fished out the decomposed body of Satyendra Singh from the Gulli ghat (Patna) of Ganga last week.        
	The JD(U) leader, who was also a city transporter, was missing from May 23, when he had accompanied Krishna to a car dealership. Singhs body was identified by his brother.         
	The police first zeroed in on the father and son duo after interrogating Guddus domestic who reportedly confessed to be a eyewitness to the crime. He allegedly admitted that Guddu shot Singh from a point-blank range at his Patna flat and then asked his aides to dump the body.

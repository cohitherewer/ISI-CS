The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Prabhakaran DMK friend 
                                                                                                               Prabhakaran DMK friend 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Chennai, April 19: M. Karunanidhi today said LTTE chief Prabhakaran was not a terrorist but a good friend and the Tamil Tigers cause was genuine though their method was flawed.        
	The Tamil Nadu chief ministers sudden revelation of his friendship with Prabhakaran  the two were never known to be close  came during an interview to an English news channel. Prabhakaran is my good friend. I dont see him as a terrorist. Those in his group may be terrorists but Prabhakaran cannot be faulted for that.        
	He said: The LTTEs goals are genuine in creating a Tamil Eelam. But even there, terrorism crept in without their knowledge.        
	Asked how he would react on getting news of Prabhakarans death, Karunanidhi, who is also the DMK chief, said: I would be really sad. This has happened only because of disunity among Tamil groups. Their objectives were correct, only the methods were wrong.        
	Karunanidhi had once said the LTTE would always be viewed through the prism of before and after the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi.         
	Prabhakaran, the prime accused in the case, is wanted in India. But by giving him a clean chit, Karunanidhi has also embarrassed his ally, the Congress, in election season.         
	It appears the DMK would stoop to any level to get votes. How can any true Congressman work for a DMK candidate after this? It is an insult to the memory of our leader Rajiv Gandhi. I think he has been wrongly advised that the Sri Lanka issue would be a major election issue when the voters are not really bothered about it, said a senior Congress MLA.         
	Sources said the ADMKs hype on the Lanka issue with the party declaring its support for a Tamil Eelam, had pushed the DMK chief to take this stand. The fear of what impact the Lankan issue will have on election results is forcing both Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa to take such extreme positions on Sri Lanka. The Lankan issue has never been an election issue in Tamil Nadu and it will not be in this election too, said Thuglak editor Cho Ramaswamy.        
	The Lankan military said today that more than 2,800 civilians fled Sri Lankas northern war zone.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 15: The stalled gas pipeline and Pakistan-exported terror will be prominent on the talks agenda when Iran foreign minister Manouchehr Mottaki meets S.M. Krishna here on Monday.        
	Tehran is the latest victim of Pakistan-based militants, who killed 42 people including five elite Revolutionary Guard officers in an explosion in southeastern Iran on October 18.        
	Mottaki will hold delegation-level talks with Krishna in the first high-level engagement between the two countries since the re-election of the Manmohan Singh government and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Mottaki will call on Singh too and is expected to renew an invitation to visit Tehran.        
	Mottakis trip comes days before Singh leaves for Washington on a state visit, a coincidence that helps India underscore its policy of not linking its relations with Tehran to its ties with Washington.        
	The Indian side is likely to tell the Iranians that New Delhi is serious about the $7 billion gas pipeline project, which will bring Iranian gas to India, and advise patience in resolving the price and security issues, sources said. India fears for the safety of the portion of the pipeline that will pass through Pakistan.        
	A joint working group of the two countries petroleum ministry officials is expected to meet soon to take the pipeline talks forward.        
	Scaling up trade and investment will also be high on the agenda. India is looking at the growing Iranian market, and the West Asian countrys large youth population, as an opportunity to expand and diversify its trade basket with Tehran.        
	Iran has accused Islamabad of shielding militants of the Pakistan-based Jundollah, which has claimed responsibility for the October 18 blast.

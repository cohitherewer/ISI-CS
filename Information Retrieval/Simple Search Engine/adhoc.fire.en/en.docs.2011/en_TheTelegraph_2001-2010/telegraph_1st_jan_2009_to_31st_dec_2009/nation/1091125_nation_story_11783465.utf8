          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 24: Commissions of inquiries by their very nature are intended to shame and not punish, even in England where a similar provision for inquiries existed long before it was incorporated in Indian law.         
	Lord Chancellor Viscount Kilmuir had explained the objectives of such panels while defending such inquiries in the House of Lords in the Waters case.        
	After the true facts have been found and stated, it may be necessary to stigmatise conduct which, although not a criminal offence or a civil wrong, falls short of requisite standards in our public life, he had said.         
	Kilmuir was defending a rather expensive inquiry into an assault on a boy by two constables.        
	The ordinary processes of law are geared to a charge or claim brought by one person against another. (But) they do not fit when it is necessary to discover what has actually happened before the responsibility of or between individuals can arise, he said.        
	Commissions of inquiries are, therefore, intended to be only fact-finding missions, legal experts here said. They ascertain facts and do not decide any dispute, said senior counsel Anil B. Divan. Their findings are recommendatory in nature, he said, adding that several governments had rejected findings of so many commissions.         
	But if a commission was to ignore the rules of natural justice  as alleged in case of the inquiry by Justice M.S. Liberhan  that mandate parties be heard before they are condemned, they can move court seeking expunging of such remarks, Divan said.         
	Liberhans brief for his long-winded inquiry that lasted 17 years was clear. He was to inquire into the sequence of events leading up to the demolition of the Babri Masjid. That included probing the roles played by the chief minister, council of ministers, bureaucrats, individuals and organisations in the demolition, deficiencies in security, alleged assault on members of the media and other matters.        
	His recommendations are long and varied, mostly in the nature of broad policy guidelines such as the need to separate religion and politics, usher in electoral reforms and deal with communal violence.         
	As a former judge, lawyers said, Liberhan stuck to his brief, not exceeding the contours of the 1952 commissions of inquiry act, which doesnt permit him to recommend penal action.        
	His findings would have no impact on the long-pending cases against the BJP and RSS top brass in two Uttar Pradesh courts, senior lawyer C.S. Vaidyanathan said.        
	The cases, according to an earlier Supreme Court ruling, will be unaffected by the view expressed by any other body. The government, though, has promised in its action taken report to expedite the hearings.        
	But the statements made by the witnesses before the commission  where the proceedings are inquisitorial  can be used for the limited purpose of confronting them should they do an about-turn in court. If witnesses have deposed under oath, the evidence can be used during his cross-examination in a court to show that he is contradicting himself, Divan said. But if a person were to self-incriminate himself, it can be used by police to prosecute him.

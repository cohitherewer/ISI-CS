                                                                                                               Delhi steps up Lanka help
          JAYANTH JACOB                               
	New Delhi, April 28: The government is stepping up efforts to send humanitarian help to Sri Lanka and play a visible role in ensuring peace in the island nation, with an eye on voters in Tamil Nadu.         
	Although the stress is on reconstruction of war-ravaged areas, Delhi is worried the LTTE violence will continue even after the conventional war ends with the Lankan armys victory.        
	India has already announced assistance of Rs 100 crore and sent 40,000 family packets  each containing food and medicines needed by a family of five for three weeks. Another 50,000 such packets will be sent soon along with material necessary for building shelters for civilians rescued from the battle zone.        
	India is also thinking of increasing its medical missions in Lanka, which now number 62.         
	Delhi, which renewed a request for LTTE boss Prabhakarans extradition, wants Colombo to honour the constitutional promise of devolution of power to Tamils.

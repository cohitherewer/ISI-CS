          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct 8: Bengal agriculture secretary Sanjeev Chopra today took police help to oust some department officials from his chamber following a protest against the transfer of a deputy director.        
	 The officials, who had gone to Chopras second-floor chamber at Writers Buildings to register their protest, later complained to home secretary Ardhendu Sen about the maltreatment, a source said.        
	Asked about the incident, Chopra said: If they had any issue regarding the transfer, they could have approached the chief secretary or the agriculture minister. Whats the point coming to my chamber? If a transfer is routine in nature, why should there be a hue and cry? These officials barged into my room without seeking an appointment. Thats why I asked the police to clear them out.        
	According to a protesting official, the agriculture secretary had been issuing transfer orders at will, often without consulting the minister. Thats why we went to his chamber to protest.        
	A Writers source said the home secretary called Chopra to his chamber after the incident and expressed his displeasure at the decision to take police assistance to drive the officials out.

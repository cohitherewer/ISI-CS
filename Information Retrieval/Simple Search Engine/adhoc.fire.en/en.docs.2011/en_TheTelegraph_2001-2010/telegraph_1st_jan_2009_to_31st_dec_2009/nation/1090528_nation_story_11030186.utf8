	New Delhi, May 27: Chiefs of defence public sector units and ordnance factories have been summoned to Delhi after the arrest of former Ordnance Factory Board director-general Sudipta Ghosh this month rattled South Block and defence minister A.K. Antony today told the private sector dont bribe our officials.        
	Ghosh, who had just retired, and three of his associates were arrested on May 19. He was being investigated on charges of accepting bribes to fix deals with Israel Military Industries to produce Zitara Carbines. He was also instrumental in arranging a Rs 1,200-crore deal to revive a project to produce Bofors ammunition in a factory in Nalanda.        
	The arrest was made in the middle of the polls before Antony took over charge of the ministry. The file was pending. A senior official said Antony pored over the papers on Tuesday and was angry because the scandal threatened to put the brakes on large-scale fast-track military purchases.        
	Antony instructed senior ministry officials to call a meeting of heads of defence public sector undertakings and ordnance factory chiefs in which the message should go down.         
	This is important, he reportedly said, as the offset requirements under the new defence procurement policy would lead to joint ventures between foreign manufacturers and defence public sector units such as Hindustan Aeronautics.        
	Also, Indian private companies with licence to participate in defence production like the Tatas and the Mahindras would increase their partnerships with the public sector.         
	Antony decided against this background to make use of a Confederation of Indian Industry-sponsored seminar with the armys Signal Corps to send out the message that liberal policies on defence procurements would be conditional on clean practices.        
	He picked on CII representative Hari Bhartias suggestion to make room for greater private participation in defence production, and warned that he would not hesitate to ruthlessly cancel contracts if malpractices were detected.         
	Antony said he had cancelled the tenders to procure 197 helicopters for the army and also to procure artillery guns for the army. If there is any manipulation or malpractice, there will be ruthless action.        
	Times have changed. You should not try to bribe or tempt our people or else they will face the music, he said.

                                                                                                               41 witnesses turn hostile
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Aug. 1: The CID-crime branch has been left on the lurch after 41 witnesses, including eyewitnesses, turned hostile resulting in a spate of acquittals in the sensational tender-fixing-related Pradip Parida murder case.        
	Exactly four years ago on August 1, 2005, Parida, a contractor who had submitted his bid for a project work of the irrigation department in Kendrapada division, was shot in broad daylight. It was followed by a week-long violence and arson in Kendrapada town.        
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik had ordered a crime branch probe after his government was rocked by the murder as it brought for the first time into focus how the gangsters were running parallel administrations by settling government tenders with alleged political patronage.        
	The CID-crime branch framed charges under Sections 302, 212, 120 (B), 34 of IPC and Sections 25 and 27 of the Arms Act against 16 people, including gangsters of a crime syndicate, active in Kendrapada and neighbouring areas, accusing them of either direct or indirect involvement in the murder.        
	No headway, however, was made regarding politicians nexus in tender-fixing.        
	But the court of the additional district sessions judge, Kendrapada, acquitted nine of them on Wednesday as the CID-crime branch failed to hold on to the witnesses as they took U-turn one after the other during trial over these years.        
	The prosecution was left with little material to prove the charges against them as all the 41 witnesses, including two eyewitnesses, in the case turned hostile, Parsuram Mohapatra, the public prosecutor in the case said today.        
	The two eyewitnesses included the driver of the scooter in which the contractor was riding pillion and the owner of a paan shop in front of which he was shot, he said, while admitting lack of professional approach in the investigation.        
	The acquitted people are Tito alias Syed Usman Ali, Narayan Swain, Nalinikanta Bal, Bhagaban Nayak, Sudhakar Behera, Ranjan Mallah, Gopal Behera, Soumya Ranjan Biswal and Ajay Mallik. Mohapatra said trial of five other accused in the case, including Hyder, is yet to be concluded. Two other accused persons have evaded arrest.

	Gaya, April 27: Medical students of Anugrah Narain Magadh Medical College Hospital attacked constables of a police outpost on their college grounds after reports of an alleged incident of eve-teasing did rounds on Sunday.        
	Some personnel were said to have teased students of the medical college and as soon as the news reached the boys hostel, they came out to give a sound thrashing to the khaki Romeos.         
	As the constables ran inside the police station, located in the south-western portion of the college premises, the students gheraoed and then ransacked the station.        
	As the situation threatened to get out of hand, Gaya superintendent of police M.R. Naik rushed to the spot.         
	He promised to take action against the personnel, if they were found to be guilty. The SP also had a strict word for the medical students for their behaviour.         
	According to the college principal Madan Mohan, the students who were allegedly harassed, did not lodge any formal complaint with the authorities. The principal added that an inquiry would be conducted as and when he received a complaint.         
	According to SP Naik, two criminal cases have been instituted in connection with the Sunday incident.         
	While one case has been registered against the unidentified constables, another case has been registered against unnamed medical students. An investigation has been started in both cases and proper action, according to law, will be taken on the basis of the outcome, the SP assured.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Friends kill boy for ransom
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Friends kill boy for ransom
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                      Azharuddin                          
	New Delhi, Dec. 30: A 16-year-old Gurgaon boy was kidnapped and killed by three friends who were regular visitors to his home and one even offered to pay a part of the ransom to avoid suspicion, police said as the plot unravelled today.        
	DPS student Mohammad Azharuddins body was found in Etah, Uttar Pradesh, 39 days after he was abducted.        
	Police sources said all three, along with two accomplices, had confessed to planning the kidnap for a ransom of Rs 50 lakh.        
	It seems these boys have been plotting the kidnap for a   
	while. They used to visit Azharuddin often. They kidnapped him when they got the chance and probably killed him the very night he was kidnapped. They then returned to their homes after the deed was done, said an official investigating the case.  
	The police said Azharuddin, a resident of Maruti Kunj in Gurgaon, did not return after stepping out of home on November 21. His father Akhtar had asked him to get some documents to submit to a bank as he had applied for an education loan for his daughter.        
	Soon after Azharuddin had left home, he met three of the five accused  Sayeed Aftab, 21, a family friend, Ravi Kumar Sakhia and Manoj Yadav, 19  who offered him a lift in an Alto they had borrowed from a friend.        
	Ravi got down after a while but Manoj and Aftab drove till Palwal, where Azharuddin was headed. They, however, told Azharuddin that as they had borrowed the Alto for the whole day, they wanted to drive a little further.        
	By the time Azharuddin realised something was wrong, they had reached Uttar Pradesh, where they were joined by two of their accomplices. But it was already too late and, in the fear of getting caught, the four strangulated the victim and disposed of his body in nearby forests, said Anil Dhawan, DCP (crime).        
	Manoj and Aftab then dropped the other two in Etah and drove back to Maruti Kunj. They behaved normally as if nothing had happened, a police source said.        
	When Azharuddin did not return till late in the evening, his father tried calling him but found his cellphone was switched off, Dhawan said.        
	Akhtar approached the police the next day, November 22. On December 17, he received a call from Azharuddins number.         
	The caller said he had kidnapped the boy and demanded for Rs 50 lakh as ransom.        
	Aftab and Manoj, both students, then willingly accompanied Akhtar to the police station. Aftab even lent Rs 2 lakh, the police said.        
	But the plot backfired as Azharuddins cellphone had run out of balance. The accused could not call from Azharuddins mobile to tell the location (where to hand over the ransom) since the balance was low. They called from a Delhi number and we traced the caller from the details, Dhawan said.        
	The two other accused have been identified as Mohd Anish, a call centre cab driver, and Thomas, an auto driver, both residents of south Delhi. Ravi is a photographer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Slumdog party time in America 
                                                                                                               Slumdog party time in America 
          K.P. NAYAR                              
	Washington, Feb. 22: All the attention that Slumdog Millionaire is getting at the Oscars at the Kodak Theatre in Los Angeles has spawned a movement across the US to help children from the slums of Mumbai.        
	From Washington in the east to Los Angeles in the west, a Slumdog mania is sweeping in its wake hundreds of Americans  not merely Indian Americans  to Oscar-viewing parties that have been planned as fund-raisers to mitigate the sufferings of Jamal Maliks and Latikas that are described in the Indo-British film in a manner that is shocking to most western audiences.        
	At Columbia University in New York, the worlds oldest university organisation of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgenders, the Columbia Queer Alliance, is hosting a viewing party at the universitys Roone Alredge Cinema with the politically correct theme of Slumdog Millionaire or Milk?        
	The latter is a reference to Milk, another movie vying for the Oscars. It is about the life of Harvey Milk, who was murdered while fighting in the infancy of Americas gay movement for equal rights for homosexuals.        
	The theme is a pun on the names of the two Oscar-nominated films on what urgently matters to slumdogs: milk or millionaire status.        
	The Columbia Queer Alliance has existed since 1967 and its leaders claim a legacy of pioneering activism and social justice. The alliance has teamed up with Club Zamana, the universitys largest South Asian organisation, for tonights party in New York.        
	In downtown Washington last night, about 200 people packed the Panache Restaurant and Lounge to hear DJ Ali Ji belt out music from Slumdog  its upbeat finale Jai Ho and Lankan-origin rapper M.I.A.s hit, Paper Planes.         
	Fox Searchlight, the distributors here for Slumdog, provided DMVABCD, a Washington-based production company, which hosted last nights party, with CDs of the films soundtrack and other memorabilia that were raffled away.        
	Fox Searchlight also permitted the films official trailer for the Oscars to be played during the party.         
	Pushpa Koneri, one of the organisers, said the entire proceeds from last nights event, would be donated to Hamara Foundation, which runs a development initiative for street children in Mumbai. The foundation began operating as a part of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Mumbai in 1989 and became a full-fledged NGO in 2002.        
	It was serious, Koneri said about the objective of the pre-Oscar party. But it was also fun.        
	In Chicago, too, a party was being planned with dancers enacting Bollywood scenes, a DJ and Indian food.        
	Elsewhere in New York, Childrens Hope India, an NGO started in 1992 by a group of professional women in the Big Apple to better the lives of disadvantaged children in India, has teamed up with the Indo-American Arts Council for a big Oscar-viewing event in mid-town.        
	An autographed Slumdog poster, a music box, Slumdog books and the films screenplay will be raffled for a charity.        
	Slumdog Millionaire premiered last November at the eighth Mahindra Indo-American Arts Council Film Festival, which is annually organised by the hosts of tonights Manhattan party, long before the film became a screen sensation.         
	At that time, even its distribution worldwide faced question marks after the original distributor, Warner Independent, folded up just before Slumdog was to be released.

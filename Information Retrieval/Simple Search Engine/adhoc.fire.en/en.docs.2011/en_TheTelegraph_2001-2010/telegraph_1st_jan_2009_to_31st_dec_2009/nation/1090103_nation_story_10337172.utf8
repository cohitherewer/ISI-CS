	Srinagar, Jan. 2: Mufti Mohammed Sayeed today said he was no more keen to be part of the UPA, days after the Congress chose to partner the National Conference in Jammu and Kashmir.         
	Personally, I do not want to be part of the UPA, the patron of the Peoples Democratic Party said, citing differences with the UPA on its pro-J amp;K agenda. He, however, added that the PDPs working committee would take the final decision. As of today, we are a part of the UPA, he clarified.

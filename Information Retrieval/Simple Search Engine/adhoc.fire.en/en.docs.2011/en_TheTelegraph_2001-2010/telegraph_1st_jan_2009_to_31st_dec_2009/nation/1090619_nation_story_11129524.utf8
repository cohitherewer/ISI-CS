          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          The remains of the police vehicle after the blast in Koraput on Thursday morning. (PTI)                                  
	Bhubaneswar, June 18: Nine police personnel, comprising eight members of the Orissa Special Striking Force (OSSF) and a state police driver, were killed in a landmine explosion at Palur in Koraput, some 440km from the state capital.        
	The slain OSSF officers have been identified as N.D. Tiwari, Virbahadur Singh, Om Narayan Sharma, Sulaiman Hero, N.K.B. Nayak, Mahiprasad Singh, Sukant Sahoo and Avinash Kujur. The ninth member of the team was state police driver Sukant Sahoo.        
	Talking to The Telegraph, state director-general of police M.M. Praharaj said: Nine personnel went missing after reports of the blast came in to the state headquarters and so far, eight bodies have been recovered.        
	The incident took place between 8.30 and 9am when the personnel were returning after a night patrol at Narayanpatna block of the district.        
	The landmine that was planted in a culvert exploded while the OSSF patrol jeep passed over it. The intensity of the blast was such that the vehicle was thrown 50 feet, eyewitnesses said. Television images showed mutilated bodies strewn across the blast site and the vehicle reduced to ashes.        
	From the morning itself, Naxalites had engineered four simultaneous minor explosions in the area spaced across small intervals.         
	Apprehending danger, another OSSF patrol team was asked to return from their beat at Laxmipur and the team returned safely. However, due to a communication gap the same information could not be passed on to the Narayanpatna team.        
	Todays attack by the CPI(Maoist) has sent an already nervous administration groping for a solution. Till the afternoon, security forces did not start off for the blast site.        
	A company of security forces did finally leave for the site on foot. We arent using any vehicles to avoid further blasts. Details are being awaited and will be available only after the forces reach the site, said Koraput superintendent of police Deepak Kumar.        
	The incident has sent shock waves in the area. Maoists had earlier blown up Baipariguda and Machhkund police stations and Ramgiri outpost on the night of June 7.         
	Raising the issue in the Assembly in the afternoon, BJP legislator and former minister Jaynarayan Mishra demanded a statement from the chief minister. Another live landmine was detected from the same area as the blast.

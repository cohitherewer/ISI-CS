          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Feb. 22: Two constables suspected in an alleged custody death were grabbed by their collars and had their uniforms torn in a public beating near Kanpur, the constituency of Union minister of state Sri Prakash Jaiswal.        
	One of the constables has been suspended and the other is being interrogated over the death of poultry farm employee Gajraj Singh.        
	The constables had picked up Gajraj last night for questioning, apparently in connection with a theft. This morning, his body was found on a road outside his village, Mandhana, around 20km from Kanpur town. The crowd set upon the duo when they came to the village, ostensibly to gather information about the 34-year-olds death.        
	The constables claimed Gajraj had died when the three-wheeler he was travelling in collided with a truck. But the police havent found the three-wheeler so far. Uttar Pradesh police chief Vikram Singh has ordered a probe.        
	The villagers alleged that Gajraj was taken into custody and tortured because he had refused to supply the constables chicken from the poultry farm he worked in. The alleged police atrocity comes weeks after an officer was sacked for lifting a six-year-old Dalit girl by her hair and beating her in Etawah, Mulayam Singh Yadavs home district.

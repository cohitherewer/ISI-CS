The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP lowers flag first time for a rival 
                                                                                                               BJP lowers flag first time for a rival 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Rajnath Singh                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 4: When BJP president Rajnath Singh spontaneously ordered the party flag to fly half-mast at its headquarters on 11 Ashoka Road as soon as Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy was officially declared dead, it was a signal to his colleagues that they must become part of the collective mourning for the Andhra chief minister.        
	The move, said a source close to Rajnath, was unprecedented in the party that had never in recent memory lowered its flag when any big leader of a rival party had passed away. Not even for Indira and Rajiv Gandhi. Nobody recalled what the Jan Sangh did when Jawaharlal Nehru died.        
	Rajnathji identified himself with Reddy. They are sons of farmers, sons of the soil who identify themselves with the poor and not the elite. Rajnathji also admired his dynamism. The circumstances of his demise were extraordinarily tragic. This moved him so much that he took the decision on the spot, the source said.        
	The BJP governments in Gujarat, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh announced a two-day mourning  again a first for the party.        
	Rajnath wasnt the only one to see shades of his brand of politics in YSR.         
	L.K. Advani, who flew to Hyderabad to pay homage to Reddy, made it a point to mention the Andhra chief ministers 1,400km-long padyatra in 2003 to reach out to the masses.         
	Sources said Advani, a veteran of numerous yatras, had told his confidants after the Congresss victory in Andhra in 2004 that there was no substitute to direct contact with people and no number of chopper rides could yield the same kind of electoral dividends.        
	Former BJP president M. Venkaiah Naidu, who shares his home state with YSR, represented the BJP at the funeral today. He lauded Reddy for his social welfare schemes.        
	While humanism was at the core of the BJPs responses, sources said the party had in principle decided that political tragedies were not occasions for indulging in partisan play.         
	It is time that parties learn to put their acrimony aside in a crisis. When a reporter asked one of our leaders to comment on the so-called power struggle within the Congress in Andhra, we treated the question with the contempt it deserved. This is not the time to gloat over such issues. We will deal with them politically as and when we need to, a source said.         
	The BJPs incessant attacks on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the UPAs first tenure often turned personal and had worked against the party in the 2009 elections.         
	The party quickly changed track in Parliament and decided that policies and not personalities should be criticised.

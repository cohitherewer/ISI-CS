                                                                                                               Barua not in Bangla: Govt
                            
	New Delhi, July 22: The UPA government today admitted in Parliament for the first time that Ulfa chief Paresh Barua had moved out of Bangladesh.        
	In a written reply to a question raised in the Rajya Sabha on whether Barua had gone to China, Union minister of state for home affairs Mullappally Ramachandran said some inputs suggest that Barua had moved out of Bangladesh for some time.         
	Barua has been operating from Bangladesh and triggering blasts in Assam since the nineties.

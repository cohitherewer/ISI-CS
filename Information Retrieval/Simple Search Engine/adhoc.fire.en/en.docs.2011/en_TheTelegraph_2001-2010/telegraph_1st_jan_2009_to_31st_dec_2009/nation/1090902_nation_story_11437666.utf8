                                                                                                               Biranchi widow points to gangster
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 1: Geetanjali Das, the widow of Budhia Singhs former coach Biranchi Das, today accused gangster Raja Acharya of murdering her husband.        
	Biranchi, the man who was often in the centre of controversy as he trained child marathon runner Budhia, was gunned down in front of his judo training centre on April 13, 2008.         
	Raja had visited the centre on the day my husband was murdered. Right after my husband and Raja went out to talk, we heard gunshots. When I rushed out, I saw Raja holding a gun and my husband lying in a pool of blood. He heard him pleading Raja to not shoot, she said to a bench at the fast track court here today.        
	She alleged that Chagala (Rajas associate) then started his vehicle and both fled.         
	Geetanjali and her sister, Shradhanjali, were examined and cross-examined by prosecution lawyer and defence counsel for four hours and more. During the trial Geetanjali was also asked about the contents of the FIR she had filed at Bargarh police station after the murder.         
	Her statements did not match, said Bana Mohanty, the advocate for the prime accused Raja Acharya. The court was adjourned before other witnesses, including three judo students, Bebina Mallick, Prassana Patra and Bagha Jena, could be heard.        
	They will be examined tomorrow.         
	As many as 18 eyewitnesses will be questioned during the trial which will continue for the next three days.         
	The statements of all witnesses are vital, said Siddharth Das, the complainants lawyer said.         
	Raja Acharya and associate Chagala are the prime accused in the murder and have been behind bars ever since June last year. Heavy security was present at the court when the gangster was brought for trial.        
	A platoon of police was deployed in the trial room, while every court member was thoroughly frisked.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Buddha sends meaningful message to Saif
                                                                                                               Buddha sends meaningful message to Saif
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              Bhattacharjee, Saifuddin				                                 
	Calcutta, June 3: Estranged comrade Saifuddin Chowdhury called on Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee after nine years today and later appeared to hint that the chief minister had sounded him out on returning to the CPM.        
	The meeting came in the wake of the Lefts recent poll drubbing and weeks after Bhattacharjees comment on STAR Ananda that he was trying in his own way to bring Chowdhury and Somnath Chatterjee back into the party.        
	Unlike the former Speaker who was expelled, Chowdhury had been allowed to resign from the party. Technically, the honourable divorce can be annulled if Chowdhury writes a letter requesting the party to take him back.         
	Chowdhury and a few colleagues from his Party for Democratic Socialism  which he floated after his exit from the CPM  met the chief minister ostensibly to submit his partys demands and suggestions for relief work in the Aila-hit Sunderbans.        
	Since we were meeting for the first time in nine years since I left the party, we enquired about each others families. Our personal relation led to some intimate discussions when I referred to the disasters in Bengal, Chowdhury later said, probably alluding to the election results also.        
	Tumio bhabo, Safi, tumio ba eta ki korle (You, too, think of it, Safi, what you had done). Our lifespan is small and there is little time left to do something meaningful for the people, Chowdhury quoted Bhattacharjee as telling him.        
	The hint was clear: Bhattacharjee was referring to Chowdhurys rupture with the CPM and implying that he wanted the former MP back.        
	But no further talk was held on his return, Chowdhury said.        
	(Sources in the CPM central leadership said there was no formal proposal before the party on taking back leaders like Chowdhury and Chatterjee, adds our Delhi bureau. There has been no discussion about this in the party. In fact, no one has brought up this matter at appropriate forums, a senior leader said.)        
	Chowdhury remained non-committal on returning to his former party. Asked whether he would like to rejoin the CPM, he said: I wont say that I wont go back or why I should go back since I respect his (chief ministers) emotions.        
	Chowdhury also underlined that his fundamental ideological differences with the CPM continues.        
	We floated the new party because of such differences. If the CPM feels the need for soul-searching and sincerely rectifies its mistakes, we may consider it. But then who are we to tell them what to do.        
	Sources said Chowdhury has reasons to be evasive as he knows CPM general secretary Prakash Karat and some other politburo members dont share Bhattacharjees sentiments.        
	But they said he has nothing to lose by going back to the CPM, especially after his loss to the Trinamul Congresss Kabir Suman in Jadavpur. Trinamul had alleged that Chowdhury was put up by the CPM  a charge the PDS leader has denied.

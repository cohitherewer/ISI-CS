The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | The high-fliers   One faces rough weather on the ground, others are much sought after in the air   Two Ps snap at Prafuls heels
                                                                                                               The high-fliers 
    Two Ps snap at Prafuls heels      - One faces rough weather on the ground, others are much sought after in the air      CHARU SUDAN KASTURI IN BHANDARA-GONDIYA (MAHARASHTRA)                          Supporters wave at Sonia Gandhis helicopter after a rally in Karimnagar near Hyderabad on April 7                                              
	Slicing betel nut for a customers paan, 27-year-old Rakesh Agashe looked up and smiled when asked which candidate offered the best hope for the region.        
	Ten minutes into the conversation, Gondiya-based Agashe had revealed he was a BA and a BEd, yet belonged to the over 1.5 lakh educated youths who were either unemployed or self-employed in this constituency, made up of the Bhandara and Gondiya districts.        
	Now, he opened up a step further. I think we should give Prafulbhai a chance this time. He added in the same breath as he looked at his betel nut again: But honestly, its very difficult for him to win.        
	In this constituency in the extreme northeast of Maharashtra, Praful Patel, the Union civil aviation minister, faces a challenge unlike anything he has had to tackle in the past five years while in charge of what was mostly a booming sector.        
	The industrialist-minister, who has a penchant for conducting business in style, is looking to avenge an embarrassing loss here in 2004 using heavy-duty fuel  Sharad Pawar and Sonia Gandhi jointly campaigned for him on Friday.        
	But even his own party is questioning the commitment of the ground support he needs to fly the distance in what major parties are labelling the most important contest in this region of Maharashtra.                    
	The Bhandara-Gondiya result may shape more than just the political future of the civil aviation minister, say leaders of the BJP, Congress, Shiv Sena and Prafuls Nationalist Congress Party.        
	It will be a pointer to the success or failure of the Congress-NCP alliance in a key constituency where the clock (the NCP symbol) needs the hand (the Congress symbol) to time it to victory.        
	A loss for Praful, say NCP sources, could damage the long-term plans of Sharad Pawars party for expansion into Vidarbha, traditionally a Congress stronghold.        
	Praful is one of three Ps shaping up as prime contenders for the winners podium from this constituency. Shishupal Patle, the sitting BJP MP and the party candidate this time too, defeated Praful by a margin of less than 2,800 votes in 2004.        
	Of the 6.8 lakh votes polled last time, Shishupal won 40.76 per cent compared with Prafuls 40.32 per cent.        
	In the towns within the constituency  Gondiya, and to a lesser extent Sakoli and Bhandara  Agashes hint at support to Praful finds resonance.        
	Prafuls family runs over 50 per cent schools and colleges in this constituency, under the banner of the Gondia Educational Society. The minister used his portfolio to set up training academies for aspiring pilots and airhostesses here.        
	But travel some 5km from the centre of Bhandara town, and the other two Ps find more frequent mention in casual conversation between residents.                  Praful Patel      
	For Praful, Nana Patole represents a bigger threat than Shishupal. A rebel Congressman contesting as an Independent, Nana could eat away the support of a major chunk of Congress workers, especially among the rural population that makes up 75 per cent of voters here, fear NCP workers.        
	Without the support of these Congress workers, it is almost impossible for Prafulbhai to win, an NCP leader said.        
	Both Shishupal and Nana belong to the Powar caste, which is numerically one of the most dominant communities here and in recent years has voted en masse for the BJP.        
	Nana may eat into some of Shishupals votes, but his chances of spoiling Prafuls party are greater. The minister, originally a Gujarati, is an outsider in the caste race.        
	The NCP is counting on a last-minute surge, and is pinning its hopes on the Sonia rally and the slew of sabhas that Pawar is addressing.

  - Down with downturn, says biz school with placements          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Bhubaneswar, April 27: Brushing aside fears of global meltdown and unemployment, the Xavier Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar, (XIMB) has managed to achieved 100 per cent placements for its postgraduate diploma in management (PGDM) students.        
	While many reputable business schools continue to face placement problems, XIMB has set a record.         
	Such success is not new for the institute, however, this years placement came up as a pleasant surprise, especially when companies are lowering recruitment and shedding workforce, said Saveeta Mohanty, the faculty placement co-ordinator at XIMB.        
	At least 54 companies participated at the on-campus placement process with the highest offer at Rs 16 lakh per annum. While the average salary for the batch was Rs 7.3 lakh per annum, the median salary was Rs 7.5 lakh per annum. There were 33 pre-placement offers and interviews.        
	Some of the star recruiters this year were Godrej, Tata Group HR, Coca Cola, Cognizant, Deloitte Consulting, Ernst amp; Young, Hewlett-Packard, TCS, Socit Grale, Axis Bank, SBI, SBI Caps, Tata Steel, IMRB, CavinKare, Bank of Baroda, IDBI Bank. Sebi, Indian Oil Corporation, Genpact, Vodafone, Idea, Tata Teleservices, ICI Paints, HSBC Global, Kalinga Soft among many others.         
	Of the offers made, finance sector grabbed 32 per cent of the students, while 23 per cent of the students opted for marketing, 18 per cent went for systems, 8 per cent for HR, 7 per cent for consulting and general management areas, respectively, while 5 per cent students accepted offers in the operations area.         
	The encouragement and help offered, in whatever form, by the over 3,000-strong alumni, who hold key positions in industry, was extremely noteworthy. Their support to stand by their alma mater played a significant role in the success of Xuberance 2009, said a beaming Fr P.T. Joseph, the XIMB director.        
	Despite 100 per cent placements, the institute witnessed a decline in the number of companies visiting its campus this year. Only 54 companies visited the campus in this years final placements against 62 companies last year.        
	Also there were no foreign placements this time as compared to four international offers last year. The institute also recorded a drop in average domestic salary in this years placements, which stood at Rs 7.3 lakh, compared to Rs 10.12 lakh in 2008.        
	The achievement of 100 per cent placement in the year of global slowdown gives me an immense sense of pride and confidence about the brand XIMB. Although the number of international offers has considerably reduced, we have been able to move on to other emerging sectors, Fr Joseph said.

	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 5: Maoists today blew up a BSNL mobile phone tower in Malkangiri district during their daylong bandh.        
	The bandh was called demanding employment for tribal youths, Scheduled Tribe status to Konda Reddy community and control of price rise of essential commodities.        
	Malkangiri superintendent of police Satyabrata Bhoi said a group of armed rebels descended on MV-74 village in Malkanagiri and blew up the tower during the wee hours of today. They had also left some posters, he added.        
	The extremists also felled trees and blocked traffic movement in the Kalimela, Motu, Chitrakonda and Balimela areas of the district. Clearing the trees from roads has been delayed because of fear of landmines, he said.        
	Two months ago, nine police personnel were killed at Palur near Narayanpatna in Koraput district on their way to clear blocked roads.        
	Panic gripped Jeypore in Koraput district, as Maoists put up posters threatening to kill Durga Prasad, the president of a private bus owners association.        
	In a related incident, four rebels were arrested during a joint raid with CRPF and Special Operations Group in Rukha village of Sundergarh district, Rourkela superintendent of police Diptesh Patnaik said.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Sept. 18: The Supreme Court today reminded the Mayavati government that budget funds couldnt be arbitrarily allotted for statues and said it wasnt satisfied with the states assurances of having stopped such construction.        
	Issuing the warning, the second within a week, a bench of Justices B.N. Agrawal and Aftab Alam said no cabinet or Assembly could set aside 80 per cent of the budgetary funds for statues and memorials as the move would violate the Constitution.         
	(The) cabinet, (the) Assembly, both are on the same footing  they have to function under the Constitution, the bench said.         
	The Mayavati government had earmarked crores to build life-size statues of herself, her mentor and BSP founder Kanshi Ram and memorials to Dalit leaders.         
	If an Assembly passes a budget setting aside 80 per cent of its budget for such statues and memorials, would it not be justiciable (subject to judicial review)? the bench asked the states counsel, Mukul Rohatgi, when he contended that all such expenses had been cleared by the Assembly.        
	The judges rejected the states claim that it hadnt violated an undertaking to halt such constructions.         
	Your affidavit (reply filed yesterday) is far from satisfactory. It is not enough to drop the case. It requires further consideration. The state exchequer has spent so much (on statues and memorials).         
	The matter will come up for hearing again on October 5.        
	The government had apologised yesterday for reported violations of its order staying work at seven memorial sites in Lucknow and claimed it had merely removed garbage and debris.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nip smoking in bud with zero-period lessons
                                                                                                               Nip smoking in bud with zero-period lessons

	New Delhi, May 21: Zero-periods may help nip adolescent smoking in the bud.         
	Extracurricular classroom activities specially designed to highlight the dangers of tobacco can help reduce the number of school-going adolescents taking up smoking, a new study in India has shown.         
	The study by researchers in New Delhi and the University of Texas, Austin, has found that tobacco use increased by 68 per cent in schools without anti-tobacco initiatives, and dropped by 17 per cent in schools where such initiatives were introduced.         
	The findings from a set of 32 government and private schools  16 each in Chennai and New Delhi  are encouraging enough to recommend similar activities in schools across the nation, the researchers said.         
	The effect is pretty dramatic, said K. Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India, New Delhi. Peer pressure and acceptability make adolescence the period of experimentation  and this is a way to prevent tobacco use.         
	The study has just been published in the American Journal of Public Health.         
	The use of tobacco in India typically starts during adolescence. A previous study had estimated more than 10 years ago that nearly 5,500 young people initiate the use of tobacco in India every day.         
	Another large survey of more than 12,000 students five years ago had shown that Class VI students were two to four times more likely to have used tobacco than Class VIII students.         
	In the new study, non-government agencies and teachers promoted anti-tobacco messages through posters, classroom lessons, and parental education to Class VI and Class VIII students in each participating school over two years.         
	We used only zero-periods that are usually reserved for extracurricular activities, said Monika Arora, director of Hriday, an agency that helped design the activities. The activities took up about six or seven periods during each academic year.

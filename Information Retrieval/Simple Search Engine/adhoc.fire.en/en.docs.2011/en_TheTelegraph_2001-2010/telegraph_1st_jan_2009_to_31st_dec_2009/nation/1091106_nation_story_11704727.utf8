          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Nov. 5: The IIT Kanpur boy from Bengal who had been missing since September has returned to his hostel  to police grilling on his apparently adventurous tour with a British woman and possible action by institute authorities.        
	IIT sources said Arko Roy was being questioned by the police and also the institute authorities.        
	He returned yesterday evening safely, IIT Kanpur registrar Sanjiv Kashalkar said.        
	Asked what had gone wrong, the registrar dripped sarcasm. It was not his problem at all, nothing seems to have gone wrong. It was our problem that he disappeared for two months as we went around giving explanations on his mysterious disappearance.        
	The final-year computer science student from Durgapur had been missing since he left his hostel on September 3 after telling his parents he was going to Delhi for a few days.        
	The 24-year-old is believed to have visited Rishikesh, Hardwar, Varanasi and Chandigarh with the British woman he met in Delhi.        
	Sources said the institute was contemplating stern action against the final-year computer science student and had set up a committee headed by dean of students Partha Chakraborty for the purpose.

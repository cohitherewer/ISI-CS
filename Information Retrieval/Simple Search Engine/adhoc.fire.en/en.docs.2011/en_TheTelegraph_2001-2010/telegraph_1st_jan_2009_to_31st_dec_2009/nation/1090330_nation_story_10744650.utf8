The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP vows black money hunt
                                                                                                               BJP vows black money hunt
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, March 29: The BJP has promised to unearth black money parked in foreign banks and bring it back to solve the problems of poverty, illiteracy and backwardness in India.         
	Declaring that the party would make this a major poll plank, L.K. Advani pleaded with the media this afternoon to make it an issue big enough to trigger a political quake in the country.         
	The BJPs prime ministerial candidate asked the Prime Minister to bring up the matter at the G20 summit in London next week.         
	Advani said if the BJP came to power, his government would seriously pursue the matter. He even announced a task force that would be set up to study the problem. The task force will include S. Gurumurthy, a chartered accountant and RSS activist, R. Vaidyanathan, a professor of finance at the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore; Mahesh Jethmalani, a lawyer, and Ajit Doval, a former Intelligence Bureau chief.         
	Advani said: As per credible estimates, the amount deposited by Indians (in offshore tax havens) ranges between $500 billion (Rs 25,00,000 crore) and $1,400 billion (Rs 70,00,000 crore).         
	The source of his information, Advani said, is a book by Raymond Baker, the founder of Washington-based think tank Global Financial Integrity.        
	Advani said leaders of France, Germany, the UK and other countries had joined forces with US President Barack Obama in the battle against tax havens after the global slowdown. This, he argued, is likely to be an important point on the agenda of the G20 summit and Singh should ask for the data of Indians who have parked their money abroad.         
	Advani said even Rs 25 lakh crore would be sufficient to relieve the debts of all farmers, build world-class infrastructure, eliminate drinking water problem and complete rural electricity.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Govinda missing on Cong list
                                                                                                               Govinda missing on Cong list
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, March 24: The invisible MP hasnt made it back to visibility even on paper, at least not yet.        
	Congress MP Govindas name is not on the first list of candidates for Mumbai constituencies the party announced today, though, to be fair, no one has been named yet from the seat he won last time  Mumbai North.        
	In 2004, Govinda (picture above) had pulled off a surprise by wresting the seat from former BJP petroleum minister Ram Naik. The actor trounced Naik, who has been fielded again by his party, by 48,000 votes but angered voters by staying away from his constituency during two emergencies  the 2005 cloudburst and the 2006 serial explosions.         
	Irked by his continued absence, residents dubbed him the invisible MP.        
	The Congress has re-nominated its sitting MPs to three of the five seats in the city it will contest  Milind Deora (Mumbai South), Priya Dutt (Mumbai North Central), and Eknath Gaikwad (Mumbai South Central).

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sangh for central combat against Maoists 
                                                                                                               Sangh for central combat against Maoists 
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 5: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) favours a unified command under the Centre to fight Maoists, instead of leaving the task to governments in the affected states.        
	At no cost must the challenge to the integrity and prestige of the State be allowed. Maoist insurgency is as serious a challenge today as terrorism, an RSS source said.        
	Although the RSS sources did not refer to the proposed anti-Maoist offensive being planned by the Centre, the comments suggest the Sangh will be in agreement, at least in principle, with the UPA government if it takes tough measures. As the CPM has also more or less supported a crackdown, chances of a consensus across political spectrums on the need for an offensive appear bright.        
	Well-placed Sangh sources told The Telegraph that in the absence of a central combat structure, the Maoists tend to concentrate their cadres and resources near the borders of states in which they operate. If there is a major strike by them, the normal tendency is for the governments of the two states sharing a border to pass the buck to each other. The perpetrators take advantage of the confusion and escape the police net, one of the sources said.        
	A unified command, on the other hand, will minimise, if not do away with, the state governments role in security deployment and allow the Centre to take over, the source added.        
	At present, a unified command is not in force in the fight against the Maoists. A multi-agency committee provides inputs for the Union home ministry which co-ordinates with the state governments concerned.        
	The Sanghs interest in a Naxalite policy arises from the fact that one of its premier service organisations, the Vanavasi Kalyan Parishad, shares a turf with the Maoists because it works largely in the tribal-dominated areas deep in the forests of Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh.        
	The nearly 14,000 projects carried out by the Vanavasi Kalyan Ashrams are supposed to be non-political.When the Vanavasi Parishad was conceptualised in 1952, it was with a political goal to make the Vanavasis (the RSSs nomenclature for tribals) aware of their rights to water, forest and land and unexplained social rights.        
	However, with the growth and spread of the Maoists, the Vanavasi units downplayed awareness creation and concentrated on service to avoid a confrontation with the Left extremists. Our largest area of work is in Jharkhand but we are able to carry on because the Maoists know we will never cross their path. Of course, there are instances of threats and small attacks but nothing serious has happened so far. The children of some Maoists study in the Ekal Vidyalayas we run, they use our dispensaries, a source said.        
	Nobody in the Sangh was willing to speak on a perception that conversion was an unstated objective of the Vanavasi Parishad  an allegation the Maoists have also levelled once in a while.        
	The sources said the RSS had decided to make its stand clear because authority of the State could not be allowed to be challenged by extremists. Out nationalist policy does not allow us any longer to remain silent, a source said.        
	The RSS had a piece of advice for political parties, including the BJP: dont strike deals, covert or otherwise, with the Maoists because they rejected the existing political system.        
	The Sangh is all praise for the Salwa Judum, a controversial counter-insurgency operation the Chhattisgarh government started in 2005 to arm civilians take on the Naxalites. It is a manifestation of peoples anger against the Maoists. The state had to support it, a Sangh source said.

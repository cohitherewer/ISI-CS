The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Naveen orders oil probe
                                                                                                               Naveen orders oil probe

	Bhubaneswar/Cuttack Sept. 23: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik directed Orissa State Pollution Control Board to conduct a probe into the alleged oil spill from Mongolian cargo vessel MV-Black Rose that sunk 6km off Paradip coast a fortnight ago.        
	Meanwhile, Paradip Port authorities sought Centres help in the case and initiated legal action against the ships owner. The owner forged a fake licence for operations, said Paradip Port Trust chairman K. Raghuramaiah.        
	Naveen asked pollution board authorities to take up a detailed study and suggest remedial measures if there has been any spill. His directive came following media reports about possibility of a leakage from the sunken vessel and news of dead fish and crabs being washed ashore.         
	An experts team from the State Pollution Control Board rushed to the spot. We visited the ship and checked the shoreline, but did not find any spill, said scientist Dillip Kumar Behera. Negligible amount of oil did leak from the service tank in the engine room, said Raghuramaiah.        
	Two ships, one belonging to the port and another to Coast Guard, are keeping a round-the-clock vigil, he said.        
	The sunken vessel had 924MT of furnace oil on board. Out of the 924MT, 900MT are believed to be inside the double-bottom tank, secure and safe, and can not be released easily. However, 24MT of oil, including grease, was inside the engine room, which may have flown out.        
	Ports pollution response tugs and Coast Guard vessels traced grease and diesel from the sunken vessel on Monday. After a thorough inspection, it was ascertained that the spill was from the service tank, but did not pose a serious threat.        
	Reports of the spill caused concern among environmentalists as the site is close to Gahirmatha marine sanctuary, one of the few remaining nesting sites for endangered Olive Ridley turtles in the world.        
	Turtle conservation group Operation Kachhapa today accused the government of ignoring a warning about the threat to the marine sanctuary much before the current oil spill near Paradip port.

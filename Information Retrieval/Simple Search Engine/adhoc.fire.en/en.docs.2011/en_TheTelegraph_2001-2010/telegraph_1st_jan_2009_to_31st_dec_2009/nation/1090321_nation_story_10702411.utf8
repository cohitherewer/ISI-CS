	Srinagar, March 20: The heat is mounting on security forces in Kashmir for pulling the trigger without restraint and Omar Abdullah does not appear in the mood to spare anyone.        
	An army court of inquiry today admitted the role of a junior commissioned officer and two soldiers of the 22 Rashtriya Rifles in the death of two youths at Bomai village in Sopore on February 21.        
	Alongside, a CRPF assistant commandant and 10 constables were detained for questioning in the murder of a carpenter in Khaigam village on Wednesday.        
	The developments coincided with two announcements by the chief minister: one, the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, which gives unbridled powers to security forces, would be repealed; two, security forces would be withdrawn from many civilian areas, starting with the shifting of a security camp at Bomai.        
	Kashmir is seething over the Bummai and Khaigam incidents, both of which involve the death of youths at the hands of security forces. Bummai villagers had decided to leave the hamlet tomorrow, claiming their demand to shift the army camp was not met.        
	But this evening, Omar announced the camp would be moved out soon.        
	Army spokesperson Lt Col J.S. Brar today said its court inquiry, headed by a brigadier-level officer, had held the JCO and two soldiers accountable for various lapses. The names of the 22 Rashtriya Rifles trio have been withheld.        
	Besides the failure to exercise desired command and control by the junior commissioned officer (there is also) the failure by two soldiers to exercise restraint in the handling of their weapon during the incident, he said.        
	Disciplinary action against the three individuals has been ordered by the General Officer Commanding of Counter Insurgency Force (Kilo), which will commence with immediate effect.        
	Omar, who addressed a news conference, said the inquiry had ruled out that the youths died in crossfire between troops and militants as claimed by the army.        
	The inquiry is clear that there was misuse in handling of weapons, which automatically rules out the option of crossfire. Besides, it says that any additional charge that may be brought out by police investigations will be dealt with as per the law, he said.        
	It is clear that standard operational procedures were not followed.        
	The incident occurred on February 21 evening when troops of the 22 Rashtriya Riffles allegedly fired at the civilians at Bomai Chowk, leaving Muhammad Amin Tantray and Javid Ahmad Dar dead.        
	Massive protests rocked the apple-rich town of Sopore subsequently. So, the army issued a statement that the two had died in crossfire following information that terrorists were holed up in Tujar village.        
	The statement claimed that the 22 Rashtriya Rifles party had exercised utmost restraint as the area was crowded. But when the terrorists fired as they fled, the troops fired back.        
	In the Khaigam incident, Ghulam Mohidin Malik, 32, was allegedly shot dead by CRPF troopers of 181 Battalion in his house.         
	Witnesses said the troopers entered the village late in the evening on the pretext of carrying out a search operation. They then went to Maliks house and opened fire, killing him on the spot.        
	There is an established procedure that local police have to be taken along for the operation. This was not followed and the men had gone to the area without a police party, said Karamvir Singh, the additional director-general of the CRPF.

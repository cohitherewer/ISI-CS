          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 23: Two rounds gone, time for back-to-the-Left chorus.        
	The Congresss allies have begun pressuring the party to re-connect with the comrades, apparently convinced that the UPA would fall far short of the majority mark of 272.        
	Sharad Pawars NCP even hinted that the coalition should take a consensus on who its Prime Minister would be instead of insisting on Manmohan Singh.        
	Congress and UPA sources admitted in private there was no way the Left would accept a government led by Singh again  not after his bitter parting with CPM chief Prakash Karat over the US nuclear deal.        
	While Congress leaders said off the record they wouldnt allow the Left or any ally, present or prospective, to dictate who the Prime Minister would be if the party were to lead the next government, they stopped short of saying if Singhs name was non-negotiable.        
	Although Union minister Ambika Soni said in Jaipur that only Manmohan Singh will be the PM if the Congress led the coalition as the largest single party, an influential general secretary talked about going through the proper procedure of calling a working committee meeting.        
	He is our candidate, we would not like to compromise on the choice. But keeping post-poll circumstances in view, we will go through the proper procedure of calling a Congress Working Committee meeting and taking the sense of the members. I will not say if Singhs choice is non-negotiable or not at this stage.        
	Others dismissed the clamour for reopening a channel with the Left as election rhetoric, but sources said the Congress was worried it might have to turn to the comrades after feedback that it could fall short of expectations in Andhra Pradesh and tot up losses in Tamil Nadu.        
	Pawar started the back-to-the-Left chorus this morning. He said he honestly felt the UPA would require the blessings and support of the Left. That is why from the first day, I am consistently saying to all my colleagues in the UPA that let us have a good rapport with the Left, he said in Baramati. The credit goes to the Left also that we were able to give the country a stable government.        
	RJD chief Lalu Prasad said the doors were still open for a post-poll alliance with the Left. We had differences with the Left only over the civilian nuclear deal and nothing else. We have been friends with the CPM for a long time, he said in Patna.        
	We were never inimical to the Left parties, added Ram Vilas Paswan, his electoral partner. We always want the Left to be with the secular forces.         
	Pawar said the Congress had every right to declare Singh as Prime Minister. But when you take a decision on the UPAs behalf, the allies will have to sit together and decide. He subtly linked it to the question of stability, saying UPA partners will be able to resolve the issue and offer a stable government.        
	Congress veterans who claimed to know Pawars mind well said he was indirectly positioning himself as a contender and trying to sell the dream of Maharashtra getting its first PM to maximise his gains.

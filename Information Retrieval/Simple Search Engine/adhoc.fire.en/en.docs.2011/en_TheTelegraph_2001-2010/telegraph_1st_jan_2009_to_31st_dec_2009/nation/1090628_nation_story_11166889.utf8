          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 27: Orissa will import 320MW power from the Centre to meet its shortfall.        
	While 70MW power will be procured out of the states unallocated share, public sector unit National Thermal Power Corporation will provide an additional 250MW from its plants, said state energy minister Atanu Sabyasachi Nayak.        
	Orissa is in the grip of the worst-ever power crisis this summer due to a shortfall of 700MW. About 2,100-2,000MW power is available against the demand of 2,900-2,800MW. The demand has been scaled down to 2,500-2,400MW following rationing of power to industries.        
	The shortfall was basically due to the fall in hydropower generation because of a prolonged dry spell and delay in onset of monsoons. The state has hydropower units at Balimela, Burla, Chiplima, Machhkund, Rengali, Upper Kolab and Upper Indravati that normally supply over 1,200MW to the state grid during monsoon between June and September.        
	But generation at the seven hydropower units (with installed capacity of 1,936MW) this summer had gone down to 500MW, official sources said.        
	Water levels have receded lower than the minimum level at reservoirs due to lack of rain in the catchment areas of major rivers in the state and bad power generation.         
	The state is now undergoing a power cut for a period ranging between one hour and three hours everyday.        
	Energy minister Nayak said the duration of power cut was likely to be reduced with the import of 320MW power from the Centre.        
	The hydro generation position is expected to improve following receipt of rainfall at several places, he said.

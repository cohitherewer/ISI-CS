                                                                                                               Jaipur fire rages, 11 feared dead
  - villagers flee amid rumours that pipeline might burst          OUR BUREAU                          Flames leap high and smoke billows at the industrial hub                                        
	Oct. 30: The inferno at a Jaipur industrial hub was still raging 24 hours after it began, with the probable death toll climbing to 11.        
	Officials said the fire, caused by three tanker blasts at an Indian Oil Corporation depot around 7.37 last evening a minute after an earthquake, might take another whole day to use up the remaining fuel and die out on its own.        
	The official toll stands at five dead and more than 100 injured but six others, all IOC employees, are trapped inside the premises and are now feared dead.        
	Sitapura Industrial Association secretary Naresh Kandoi said the losses at the hub would be at least Rs 600-700 crore, with factory buildings damaged and machinery destroyed. IOC sources said about Rs 150 crore worth of auto fuel had burnt out.        
	Rumours that the underground fuel pipeline might explode has emptied all nearby villages, but a police officer said experts had allayed such fears saying there was no oxygen underground.        
	The depot can hold 100,000 kilolitres of petrol, diesel and kerosene in 13 storage tanks. About 50,000kl of fuel, mostly diesel, caught fire because of a pipeline leak at one of the tanks after the daily routine of loading fuel into the tankers ended, IOC sources said.        
	The fire continues to rage in 4-5 tanks where the product is being allowed to burn under controlled conditions so that the intensity and the damage are minimised, said IOC chairman Sarthak Behuria, who accompanied Union petroleum minister Murli Deora to the spot.        
	At least seven oil tankers were burning this evening, the smoke billowing from them darkening the sky. Three other tankers lay upturned. With strong winds blowing, the chances of the fire spreading further than the already engulfed 3-4km could not be ruled out.        
	A fourth blast rocked the site around 8.45am today, sending onlookers scurrying to save themselves from the fire that came raining down. The army is patrolling the area.        
	The blasts have broken the false ceilings, shattered windowpanes and produced cracks in the walls of the Infosys and Genpact offices. The damaged units include a General Motors workshop, a new Chevrolet showroom and workshop, JWS Foods, Florence Foods, Sriram General Insurance and Morani Motors.         
	The worst-affected is Genus Electronics, which has about 10 units spread across 10,000sqm, where at least 600 people work. An engineering college, JECRC, too has suffered damage.        
	Owners whose factories are still intact have been removing whatever they can, fearing the fire might spread.        
	The industrial belt remained shut with at least 10 engineering colleges also closed. Even the nearby Sanganer area remained closed with no public transport allowed in the locality.        
	Some 20 major trains that pass through the area have been diverted and the Palace on Wheels halted at Durgapura railway station.        
	Production at IOCs Mathura refinery, which supplies fuel to the Jaipur depot through a pipeline, has not been affected.        
	Deora has announced a panel to probe the cause of the fire and suggest safety measures in six weeks. The families of the dead have been promised Rs 12 lakh each, the seriously injured Rs 3 lakh and those with minor injuries, Rs 1.5 lakh.

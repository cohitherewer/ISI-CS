The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Modi talks tax loss
                                                                                                               Modi talks tax loss
                            
	Patna, Oct. 18 (PTI): Bihars deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi today demanded adequate compensation for revenue losses to be incurred by the state after implementing Goods and Services Tax (GST), from April 1, 2010.        
	Our past experience with the Centre has been poor while seeking compensation for revenue losses incurred by implementing taxes such as Central Sales Tax, Modi told reporters.         
	If the GST is implemented, Modi, who holds the finance portfolio, said: Though we have not calculated the loss, but implementation would lead to problems. The state will lose around Rs 600 crore on entry tax as the tax will be merged with GST.         
	Similarly, the state would lose Rs 260 crore as service tax from the Centre. Now that the onus of collecting service tax will lie on the state, it would have to develop its own mechanism, he said.

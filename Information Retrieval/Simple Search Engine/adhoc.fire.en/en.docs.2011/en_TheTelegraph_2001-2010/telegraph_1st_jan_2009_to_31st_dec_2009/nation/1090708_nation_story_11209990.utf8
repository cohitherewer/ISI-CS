          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 7: Rural development minister C.P. Joshi today embarrassed the CPM in Parliament, listing Left-ruled states prominently among those that had failed to provide the guaranteed 100 days employment under the rural job scheme.        
	Samajwadi Party MP Mahendra Mohan had placed a written question on the expansion plans for the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, which got a 144 per cent hike in funds in the budget.         
	Joshi (in picture) named only non-Congress states, stressing Left-ruled ones. Bengal, he said, had provided employment for only 14 days in 2006-07, 25 in 2007-08 and 26 days in 2008-09. The national average for the last three years was 45 days.        
	When a Kerala CPM MP asked about Tripura, Joshi said Tripura had provided work only for 64 days the last financial year. Your own state is unable to complete 100 days. Why are you getting so agitated about it? Joshi asked.

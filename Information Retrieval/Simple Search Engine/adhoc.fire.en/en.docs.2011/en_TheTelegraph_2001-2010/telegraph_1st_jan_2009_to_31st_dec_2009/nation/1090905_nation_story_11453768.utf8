The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pashupati   priests beaten up
                                                                                                               Pashupati   priests beaten up
                                  
	Kathmandu, Sept. 4 (PTI): Two newly appointed Indian priests at the Pashupatinath temple here were today beaten up by Maoists, Nepal police said.        
	The rebels have been opposing the appointment of Indian priests and demanding that locals be recruited for the job.         
	This afternoon, a group of 25 to 30 rebels went inside the temple pretending to be worshippers and thrashed priests Girish Bhatta and Raghamendra Bhatta, both aged 32 and hailing from Karnataka, the police said. Four policemen trying to save the duo were also injured, they said.        
	Indian ambassador Rakesh Sood took up the matter with home minister Bhim Bahadur Rawal, who assured him that steps would be taken for the priests safety.        
	Earlier this week, activists of the Maoist-affiliated Struggle Committee, campaigning for the appointment of Nepalese priests, had threatened to launch an agitation if the Indian priests were brought in. On August 30, around 300 Maoists had stormed the office of the temples managing committee and locked it to disrupt the recruitment of Indian priests.

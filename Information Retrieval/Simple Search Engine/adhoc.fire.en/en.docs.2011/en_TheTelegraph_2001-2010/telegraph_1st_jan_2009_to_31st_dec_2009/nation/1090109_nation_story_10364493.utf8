          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          A poster of Pranjal Deka released by police                                  
	Guwahati, Jan. 8: Police today claimed to have chased and killed Ulfa militant Pranjal Deka, a suspect in the New Year Guwahati blasts, in a village encounter.        
	The alleged gunfight took place around 6.30 this evening at Halikuchi on the banks of Nonoi in Rangiya, about 60km from here. Another person was injured but escaped, state police chief G.M. Srivastava said.        
	We launched an operation using Sulfa (surrendered Ulfa) spotters in the morning but failed to locate Pranjal. But in the afternoon we again received information about Pranjal being holed up in the area, said an officer from Nalbari district police.        
	When we arrived in the village, two persons started running across a paddy field. We tried to stop them but they kept on running and firing at us. We were forced to shoot back.        
	He said the person who escaped wore a lungi. The police claimed to have seized explosives and a pistol.        
	The police had said Pranjal, 20, had dumped a bomb in a garbage vat in Birubari, Guwahati, causing the first of the three blasts on January 1.        
	Pranjal had set the timer but could not plant the bomb at the desired location because of heavy security presence, an officer had then said.        
	The blasts at Birubari, Bhootnath and Bhangagarh had coincided with P. Chidambarams maiden visit to Assam as Union home minister.        
	Arrested Ulfa man Sanjib Talukdar, accused in the Bhootnath blast, was taken to the market site today to show how and where he had parked the explosives-laden bicycle. Five people were killed in the blast.

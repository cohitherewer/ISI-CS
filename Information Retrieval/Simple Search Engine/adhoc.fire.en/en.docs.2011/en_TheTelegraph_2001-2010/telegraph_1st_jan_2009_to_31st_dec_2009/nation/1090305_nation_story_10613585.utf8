The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | JNU mulls Bachelors courses
                                                                                                               JNU mulls Bachelors courses
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, March 4: Jawaharlal Nehru University is eyeing the possibility of offering undergraduate studies across education streams in a landmark shift proposed by its chancellor, former University Grants Commission chairman Yash Pal.        
	JNUs executive council, its highest decision-making body, will meet this month to discuss the proposal, which could transform its character.        
	Yash Pals suggestion came at the university court meeting in January, sources said. The chancellor is the universitys top administrator below the Visitor (the President of India), and the court its broadest recommendatory authority.        
	The university now offers undergraduate courses only in languages and is best known for its postgraduate studies and research. Its reputation as an institution of excellence has in the past too fuelled calls for it to open up to undergraduate studies.        
	However, vocal sections in the university have opposed these calls, fearing JNU might lose its edge in research if its focus shifts to undergraduate education.        
	Never before, though, has the chancellor pushed for an expansion into undergraduate territory, and university officials confirmed that the proposal was under serious consideration.        
	JNU vice-chancellor B.B. Bhattacharya told The Telegraph: I agree with Professor Yash Pals proposal, but a decision can only be taken by the executive council. The council is meeting this month.        
	Sources said Yash Pal had also recommended that all central universities teach undergraduate courses. The suggestion has been made in a report by a central higher education advisory panel that may be handed to the government this month.        
	The panel, formed in 2008 as a review committee, was later re-categorised as an advisory panel amid concerns that its recommendations may not be easy for the Centre to digest. An advisory bodys recommendations are not binding.        
	The panels report is expected to contain strong criticism of the human resource development ministrys handling of higher education.        
	If the ministry accepts the recommendation that all central universities should offer undergraduate courses, this will automatically affect JNU and the University of Hyderabad  the only two top central universities that primarily offer postgraduate education and research opportunities.        
	But Yash Pals recommendation to the JNU court means the university can independently decide to open its doors to undergraduate education, irrespective of the ministrys decision on the panels overall report.        
	The Yash Pal panel plans to ask the government to revamp its higher education regulatory mechanism and stay away from the appointment of vice-chancellors.        
	Its report will recommend that a higher education commission (HEC) be set up to co-ordinate between the various arms of education, now governed by different bodies.        
	The panel will suggest two options. One, that the HEC be created over and above existing regulators such as the University Grants Commission and the All India Council for Technical Education. Two, that the UGC expand its role  now limited to regulating universities  and take on the responsibilities of an HEC.

	May 8: Factionalism in the Kerala CPM has resurfaced at a time the party is busy with Bengal elections.         
	State secretariat members said at a meeting in Thiruvananthapuram today where V.S. Achuthanandan was present that the chief minister should resign.         
	This comes after Achuthanandan told a cabinet meeting the law should take its course in a corruption case against Pinarayi Vijayan, the state secretary. The cabinet, however, decided to go by the advocate-generals opinion against granting sanction to prosecute Vijayan.         
	The party issued an official denial. News reports that issues related with the chief minister came up is something shaped up by the imagination of some media. Neither such discussions nor a decision for seeking the resignation was made... it said.        
	The stage is set for an open war after May 16.

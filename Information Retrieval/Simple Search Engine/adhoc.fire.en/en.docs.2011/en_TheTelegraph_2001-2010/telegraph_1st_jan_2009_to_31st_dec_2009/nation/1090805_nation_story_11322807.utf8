          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Aug. 4: Sajid Usman Sheikh was tense about his wifes health as his family made arrangements for daughter Ridas funeral,        
	She was taken away by government authorities for swine flu screening today. She was Ridas prime care-giver. Doctors are worried that she may have contracted the disease though she has not shown symptoms of the flu yet, he said.        
	Later in the evening, Dr Pradeep Awte, head of the nodal flu monitoring cell in Maharashtra, confirmed that going by initial examinations, Ridas mother and a cousin  they had remained in close touch with the girl  had tested negative for swine flu and would be released soon.        
	In all, 27 people who came in contact with the 14-year-old girl  the first to die of swine flu in India  since she developed symptoms on July 21 have been quarantined for screening in addition to the three doctors and a nurse who tended to her at the private hospital.        
	She was admitted to Jehangir Hospital where she was kept in a ward of 20 beds. She was quarantined there since July 27. So there may be many who might have been affected. Jehangir Hospital has claimed it was treating all those who had come in contact with Rida. But I am not sure how they tried to ensure that other people dont get infected by H1N1. In Pune, only Naidu Hospital and Aundh General Hospital have special swine flu quarantine wards, said Dr R.R. Pardeshi, the chief medical officer of Punes municipal corporation.        
	Many of Ridas classmates at St Annes School in Punes camp area have been taken for screening by the municipal corporation.        
	Maharashtra minister of state for health and family welfare Shobha Bachhav said the government would have all students of the school screened. The principal, Nirmala Chandy, however, said she was in the dark about any such plan.        
	Nobody has got in touch with me so far. I received a call from an officer in the state education department on Monday asking me to close the school after news of Ridas death came out. We have declared as of now that the school will be closed for the next two days, she said.        
	One of her close friends has already developed symptoms. After Rida died yesterday, this girls parents took her to Nair hospital (one of Punes two government hospitals treating swine flu patients) and she has been quarantined there, said a Class IX student of St Annes, who did not wish to be named.        
	A panic-stricken state government invoked the Epidemic Act in Pune, Satara and Panchgani districts after Ridas death. This means the government can now forcibly quarantine anybody who seems to have symptoms of swine flu, said additional chief secretary, health, S. Gokhale.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lost-cheque onus on bank
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Lost-cheque onus on bank
  - SC upholds Rs 3.4-lakh compensation for accountholder         SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                                    
	New Delhi, Dec. 9: The Supreme Court has refused to interfere with a consumer forum order that asked a bank to reimburse the money an accountholder lost after he misplaced a chequebook and someone withdrew over Rs 3.5 lakh with a forged signature.        
	The court said it was a clear case of deficiency in service and added that the bank had also failed to explain how it could honour a cheque in excess of the balance when the holder didnt enjoy overdraft facility.        
	One of the amounts withdrawn was Rs 3,50,000 when the balance in the account was Rs 3,46,682.93. The cheque was honoured by recording a debit entry of Rs 3,317.07.        
	In our opinion, this fact, highlighted by the state commission, by itself is a glaring example of negligence/deficiency in the service of the bank, a bench of Justices D.K. Jain and T.S. Thakur said.        
	Vijaya Bank account holder Gurnam Singh, who had a savings account, had lost his chequebook that still had one unused leaf and the requisition slip required for a new chequebook.        
	On September 24, 1999, when he visited the bank to withdraw money, Singh found his account had a balance of Rs 1,682.93 when it should have been over Rs 3 lakh.        
	When he asked bank officials, he was told Rs 2,500 had been withdrawn with the unused leaf in his misplaced chequebook and Rs 3,50,000 with a cheque from a new chequebook that had been issued against the requisition slip.        
	Singh requested the bank to reimburse the amount but was turned down. He then filed a complaint with the Chandigarh District Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum.        
	The forum asked for Singhs account-opening form, the requisition slip and the two cheques and found that the signatures on the cheques and the slip didnt match the specimen signatures on the account-opening form.        
	In an order on December 4, 2001, the forum said there had been gross deficiency in service on the part of the bank.         
	The forum directed the bank to credit Rs 3,47,500 to Singhs account with interest at 10 per cent per annum with effect from August 17, 1999, till the date of correct entry.        
	The bank moved the state consumer commission but the higher forum threw out its appeal. The national commission, too, dismissed its plea, saying both the lower forums had reached the same conclusion that the bank was guilty of negligence.         
	The bank then moved the apex court. Its lawyer, Sanjay Hegde, said all the forums had erred in ignoring the opinion of a handwriting expert the bank had submitted as evidence to claim there had been no forgery.         
	Last week, the court said the expert had never been cross-examined and the manager who had annexed what he claimed was the experts report couldnt prove it was indeed so.        
	So all the forums were justified in ignoring the report, the court said.

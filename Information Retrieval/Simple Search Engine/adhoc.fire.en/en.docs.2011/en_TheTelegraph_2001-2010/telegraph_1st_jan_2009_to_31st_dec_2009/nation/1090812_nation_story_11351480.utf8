The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | British anchors Tamiflu scare
                                                                                                               British anchors Tamiflu scare
          AMIT ROY                              
	London, Aug. 11: A television presenter who was interviewing Britains health secretary on the benefits and side effects of giving Tamiflu to children suddenly turned on the minister and said his daughter almost died after taking the swine flu drug.        
	On GMTV today, Andy Burnham said on the whole it was a good thing but presenter Andrew Castle was far from convinced.        
	He brought up the personal example of his elder daughter Georgina, a 16-year-old pupil at Alleyns, a well-known public school in south London where five pupils were diagnosed with swine flu in May.        
	As a result, the school was temporarily closed and all pupils, including Georgina, routinely given a course of Tamiflu.        
	The effect on her was nearly fatal, her father disclosed as he confronted the health secretary.        
	We saw a respiratory collapse through it and it almost cost my older child her life, said Castle. I can tell you that my child  who was not diagnosed at all  she had asthma, she took Tamiflu and almost died.        
	He pointed out: Nobody checked that she had swine flu beforehand. The health protection agency just handed it (Tamiflu) out and a lot of kids suffered in the school very heavily.        
	The problem was compounded when Castle found he could not get treatment for his daughter. This is because doctors surgeries (a place where doctors see patients) were refusing to see patients for fear they would spread the infection.        
	Castle said: The doctors surgery wouldnt take her. The doctor said, No, we cant take her to A amp;E (hospital accident and emergency). So shes just on the floor having this nightmare of a situation. A lot of people are in this situation. They dont know what to do.        
	Burnham sympathised with Castle but responded: It must have been a very worrying situation for you, but that was in a very different phase of the illness when we were seeing the scenes from Mexico and we were in what we call the containment phase, where we were trying to isolate every case and then giving Tamiflu to those around those cases. People shouldnt take Tamiflu unless they have got swine flu.        
	Burnham added: Swine flu is a new virus, its early days and were adopting very much a safety-first approach to tackling the illness. Tamiflu is our only, our main line of defence against this new virus right now.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chandigarh, Aug. 25: A suspected terrorist and his female companion engaged police in an hour-long shootout at Ludhiana station early this morning after killing a vendor who had tried to stop him from firing at two constables.        
	The police are investigating whether Balbir Singh Bhootna, who they claim is a proclaimed offender in an arms case, has links with Khalistani terror outfits.        
	PTI quoted police sources in Jalandhar, where the arms case was filed three years ago, as saying that Bhootna had been been earlier arrested by Jammu police while crossing over from Pakistan, where he allegedly received weapons training during 2005-06.        
	Constables Niranjan Singh and Karanpal Singh, at whom Bhootna fired during an altercation over checking of his luggage on the Jammu-bound Jhelum Express around 3.30 this morning, have been admitted to hospital.         
	As the constables lay injured, Bhootna rushed out of the compartment and hid himself near another coach with the woman.        
	Other passengers on the train and the platforms were asked to clear out as the cops engaged the duo, who were caught after almost an hour. Bhootna claimed the woman, whom the police identified as Sukhbinder Kaur, was his wife.        
	Some of the commuters initially thought they were caught in a terror attack. I had just stepped out of my compartment when I heard people shouting Bhago bhago, aatankwadi goli chala rahe hain (run, terrorists are firing. I turned around and saw a person (the vendor) lying on the ground. I ran out as fast as I could, leaving my handbag behind, Rajiv Goel, a passenger on the train, said over phone.        
	Another passenger, Harcharan Singh, said Bhootna had fired after an altercation with the two police personnel as they insisted on checking only his luggage. He was arguing why they wanted to search only his luggage.        
	Ludhiana SSP Sukhchain Singh didnt confirm if Bhootna, who had boarded the train at Manmad in Maharashtra, had terror links, only saying the inquiry is still on. But another officer said: We are investigating whether he has links with Khalistani terror groups.

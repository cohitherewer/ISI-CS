	Jaipur, Jan. 10: Indias answer to the economic slowdown: a train even costlier than the Palace on Wheels.        
	The super luxury Royal Rajasthan on Wheels, whose top fare of $2,000 (Rs 97,600) per person per night is three times the highest rate on the Palace, makes its maiden trip tomorrow with 15 passengers, less than a fifth of its capacity of 82.        
	Officials say the economic crisis may have reduced tourist inflow but not for the Palace. It is booked full till the season ends in March. The Royal, they claim, is being launched to mop up those who couldnt find berths on the Palace.        
	The higher cost is not likely to deter elite foreign tourists since they will get extra facilities and services (on the Royal), said Naresh Gangwal, manager of the Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation (RTDC), which introduced the train as a joint venture with the railways.        
	Both the Palace and the Royal follow the same itinerary  Delhi, Jaipur, Jaisalmer, Jodhpur, Sawai Madhopur, Chittorgarh, Udaipur, Bharatpur, Agra and back to Delhi after a week.        
	RTDC officials say the Royals high point is its super deluxe saloon that has two plush suites, whose occupants will travel by luxury cars while sightseeing and have personal khidmatgars.        
	It also scores over the Palace in offering two resto bars, complete with lounging area, bar counters and eating areas. Amatrra has been contracted to set up a spa on the train, and wi-fi connections too will be available soon, sources said.        
	Not everyone in the travel industry is equally enthusiastic, though. This will definitely be a lean season, and tapping those who failed to get bookings on the Palace would be hard. The train is being launched too quickly, without proper promotion. Having the same itinerary as the Palace will be a drawback, said a senior Sita Travels official, who did not want to be named.        
	RTDC sources claimed the Royal would offer the same luxury as the Orient Express of Europe and the Blue Train of South Africa, and that even the Palace rated among the worlds top 10 luxury trains.         
	But the Sita Travels official said many western tourists complain that the Palace is not value for money. We offer excellent hospitality, a cultural experience and a sense of belonging. But we cant match the West in branded luxury, he said.        
	On the Orient Express and the Blue Train, the customer is pampered with goose-down duvets, pillows, Christian Dior products, private washrooms, boutiques. Besides, butlers are at your beck and call all the time without intruding on your privacy.

	 New Delhi, May 16: If the revival of the Congress is the most crucial political development of Election 2009, the return of Muslim support for the party is the next big thing.        
	To a large extent, the Congress undoubtedly owes its victory to a clear Muslim swing, especially in the Left citadels of Bengal and Kerala.        
	The swing also meant that for the first time since the demolition of the Babri mosque in 1992, the Muslims had embraced a national party in a big way. Analysts said one factor that may have swayed the minority vote for the Congress was that it could present itself as a strong contender. Coupled with the fear of Narendra Modi coming to power, it turned out to be an easy win.        
	The secular image of the Gandhi family, its attitude towards the community and the poor, and the clean and sincere image of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his accessibility to the community leaders have gone a long way to convince Muslims to vote again for the Congress, said Zafarul-Islam Khan of the All India Muslim Majlis-e Mushawarat, an umbrella body of Muslim organisations.        
	The Congresss initiatives  like measures taken following the Sachar committee report, the Prime Ministers revised 15-point programme for the welfare of minorities, scholarship schemes for minority students and schools in minority areas  are also said to have helped to bring Muslims back to the Congress.        
	After the Babri demolition, the community had tried out several political formations like the Samajwadi Party, RJD and the Bahujan Samaj Party and were obviously looking for a better option. It was in this palpable disenchantment that the Congress anchored its minority card.        
	No one has ever seriously bothered to address their basic concerns and only used them as vote banks. The Muslims gradually realised that it was only the Congress that they could look up to. Besides, the Congress has a track record and made contributions for the welfare of Muslims, said Anees Durrani, who is in charge of the Congresss minority cell.        
	The party also played on the fear factor in the minds of Muslims about the possibility of Modi coming to power. We tried to convince the Muslim masses that only the Congress could stop the BJP and Modi. We advised them not to waste their vote on any other party, Durrani said.        
	Besides 14 Muslim-majority constituencies, 28 have high Muslim concentration of above 30 per cent. In 60 other seats, Muslims account for over 20 per cent of the voters.        
	It was a strategic decision of Muslims to opt for the friend, though it may have been unfaithful at times, said Anwar Ubaidulla, a specialist on minority issues.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          A groundsman works at Barabati Stadium on Saturday. (Badrika Nath Das)                                  
	Cuttack, Dec. 13: Orissa Cricket Association (OCA) secretary Asirbad Behera today said a three-tier security cover along with a network of closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras would ensure foolproof safety during the India-Sri Lanka ODI at Barabati Stadium on December 21.        
	Arrangements are being made to fix CCTV cameras for easy monitoring of gates from the Clock Tower inside the stadium, Behera said.        
	Public liability insurance (spectators and visitors) has a share of Rs 3 crore, while the entire match has been insured for Rs 14 crore, the secretary said addressing a news conference here today.         
	The OCA has almost finished preparations for the day-night ODI, Behera said, while adding that arrangements were being made for sale of tickets on December 18. The tickets have been priced at Rs 8,000, Rs 7,000, Rs 3,000, Rs 2,000, Rs 1,500, Rs 400 and Rs 200 (players and students concession).        
	The city has already hosted 14 ODIs. The last was when England lost to India on November 26 last year. The capacity at Barabati Stadium has been increased to 39,000. Of them, 15,000 will be available for sale. The rest of the tickets will be reserved for BCCI sponsors, BCCI and OCA-affiliated units and complimentary categories, Behera said. There will also be 1,050 AC seats and 300 non-AC seats in a new corporate box in addition to the corporate box with 100 seats introduced during the last ODI.        
	Besides, six giant screens will be installed at different places outside the stadium premises for facilitating cricket-lovers to watch the match, he added.         
	Last year, the capacity was increased to nearly 34,000, but only 14,455 tickets were put up for sale.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 7: The Supreme Court today rejected two special leave petitions that were blocking the expansion of Milan Mela, the trade fair ground on EM Bypass.        
	The court dismissed the petitions filed by Naren Das and Pulak Das who claimed that the Calcutta Municipal Corporation had usurped a part of the 18-acre plot earmarked for Milan Mela. The court had earlier directed that status quo be maintained following their plea.        
	Subrata Gupta, the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation managing director, said a roadblock for expansion of the fair ground had now been removed. The organisers will feel confident of holding the fair here, he said.        
	The mela ground, where the Calcutta Book Fair is also scheduled to be held, is owned by the CMC and the WBIDC.

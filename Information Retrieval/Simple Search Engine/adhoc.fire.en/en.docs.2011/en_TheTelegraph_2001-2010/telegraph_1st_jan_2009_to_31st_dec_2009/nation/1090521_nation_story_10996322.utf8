                                                                                                               Naveen stakes claim
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                         
	Bhubaneswar, May 20: The countdown to a new government began today in Orissa with BJD leader Naveen Patnaik meeting Governor M.C. Bhandare (in picture) and staking his claim.         
	Naveen, who was unanimously elected as the leader of BJD legislators yesterday evening, drove to Raj Bhavan in the morning and handed over a list of 103 party MLAs to Bhandare in support of his claim. The meeting lasted for 30 minutes during which a formal invitation was extended to the chief minister-in-waiting to form the government, Raj Bhavan sources said.         
	I have been invited by the governor to form the government, Naveen said. The swearing-in will be held at Raj Bhavan tomorrow.         
	Sources said a list of would-be ministers was also submitted to facilitate arrangements for the swearing-in. Yesterday, chief electoral officer Alaka Panda had also met the governor and presented a list of newly-elected legislators.        
	Though Naveen will be sworn in as the chief minister for the third consecutive term, BJD will form the government on its own strength for the first time. Naveen had headed BJD-BJP coalition in 2000 and 2004.        
	This time, BJD has secured absolute majority on its own by winning 103 seats in the 147-member assembly. Though the regional party had entered into a pre-poll seat adjustment with the Left and the NCP, following its split with the BJP in March, and even though five NCP and CPI candidates won, BJD will form government without their support.         
	Meanwhile, a notification has been issued for the constitution of the new House. The outgoing Assembly was dissolved on May 15 on recommendation of the council of ministers. Newly-elected members will take oath on May 21 and 22, following which the election for the Speaker will be conducted on May 23, Assembly sources said. V. Sugnana Kumari Deo, elected for the ninth time to the Assembly, has been nominated as the Protem Speaker.

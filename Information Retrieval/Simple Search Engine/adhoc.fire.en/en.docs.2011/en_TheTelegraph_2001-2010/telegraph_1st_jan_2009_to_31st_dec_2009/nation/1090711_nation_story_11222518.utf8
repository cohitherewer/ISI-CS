          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Patna, July 10: Hundreds of contractual teachers, protesting against pay discrimination, fought a pitched battle with the police in the capital today. Several protesters and two policemen were injured in the stone and tear gas charge.        
	The state has been witnessing a tussle between the government and some 1.75lakh teachers who were hired on contractual basis in 2006 to fill vacancies in the primary schools and also to ensure better employment.         
	The contractual teachers receive Rs 5,000-Rs 7000 per month, half of the salary of the regular teachers in the government school. So, the contractual teachers have been demanding pay parity.         
	Though the Nitish Kumar government recently agreed to the demand, it set a pre-condition that all contractual teachers should appear for a competency test and secure at least 45 per cent. The teachers then moved the high court against the pre-condition.        
	The matter which is still under the courts consideration has frustrated the group even further leading to the teachers hitting the streets and turned violent often.         
	Today, however, Patna district magistrate Jitendra Prasad said the situation was in control. Police did resort to teargas shells to disperse the mob, but batons were not used on the teachers who were pelting stones.         
	Meanwhile, in the Hosue today the chief minister asserted that the state would not accord parity to the contractual teachers unless the group agreed to appear for the competency test.         
	It would not be fair for the government schoolteachers, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nepotism? Mumbai fuss puzzles Haryana
                                                                                                               Nepotism? Mumbai fuss puzzles Haryana
          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 27: The ballyhoo over the candidature of President Pratibha Patils son Rajendra, former Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukhs son Amit and Union minister Sushil Kumar Shindes daughter Praniti has left Congress leaders in Haryana bewildered.        
	They wonder if this is an issue at all in todays politics.        
	After all, Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, whose son Deepinder is already an MP, has contrived tickets for six of his relatives.        
	Karan Dalal, Sunita Singh, Krishna Jalawat, Virendra Singh, Jagbir Malik, Dharmveer a disgruntled ticket-seeker reeled off the names.        
	An aide enthusiastically added Sampat Singh, who is likely to become a relative of Hooda when one of his children marries into the Hooda clan in the not-too-distant future.        
	Some central leaders had been worried about the Congress becoming a Jat party in Haryana and wanted the ticket-distribution to balance things out and restore the partys traditional rainbow coalition. But Hooda bulldozed his way through, extracting 30 per cent of the tickets for Jats.        
	What has vexed veteran Congress members is the complete dominance of Jat leaders who were once lieutenants of the late Devi Lal, a man who epitomised anti-Congressism in north India.        
	Leaders such as Sampat Singh, Jai Prakash, Kailasho Devi Saini, Harminder Singh Chattha, Captain Ajay Singh Yadav, Sushil Kumar Indora, Raghbir Singh Kadyan, Anand Singh Dange, Prof Virender, Srikrishna Hooda, Ramesh Kaushik, Mahendra Pratap and Karan Dalal, who are now on the Congress candidates list, were all Devi Lals men.        
	Devi Lals son Ranjit Singh too has been given a Congress ticket. Sources say that at least 45 of the total 90 seats have gone to outsiders or turncoats.        
	The majority view in the party had been that the leadership should learn from the Andhra Pradesh experience (following the YSR tragedy) and not put all its eggs in one basket. This lobby also disapproved of Hoodas move to turn the Congress into a Jat party and the unprecedented projection of his own personality in the run-up to the elections.        
	But the critics now agree that in Haryana, the Congress is completely Hooda-centric and there is no alternative force that can confront his might.        
	Hooda has been able to risk antagonising other Congress leaders and build a team of his own loyalists primarily because the disjointed Opposition has allowed him to throw caution to the winds.        
	The recent Lok Sabha elections proved that no real alternative to Hooda has yet taken shape in Haryana. Also, issues like dynasty and nepotism do not agitate the voters mind because every party is guilty of this practice.        
	The main Opposition, the Indian National Lok Dal run by Devi Lals son Om Prakash Chautala, is a known family fief. Chautalas son Ajay has almost taken over the reins of the party.        
	The other major force is represented by Bhajan Lal, whose son Kuldeep Bishnoi runs his party. Bhajans wife too is contesting this election. Bhajans elder son Chander Mohan alias Chand Mohammad, a former minister, would have contested on a Congress ticket but for the scandal over his affair and second marriage to Fiza.

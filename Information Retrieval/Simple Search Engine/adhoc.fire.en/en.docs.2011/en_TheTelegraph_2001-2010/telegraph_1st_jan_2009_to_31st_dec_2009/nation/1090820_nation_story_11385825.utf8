The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pak sees mad rush minus visionary
                                                                                                               Pak sees mad rush minus visionary
          NASIR JAFFRY                          Mohammad Ali Jinnah                                   
	Islamabad, Aug. 19: Jaswant Singhs expulsion has helped re-affix the label of visionary on Atal Bihari Vajpayee in a country with which the former Indian Prime Minister sought peace but could not quite get it.         
	The Pakistani intelligentsia heaped scorn on the BJP for expelling Jaswant because he has praised Mohammad Ali Jinnah in his new book, which also argues that the Congress leadership, especially Jawaharlal Nehru and Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, was equally responsible for Partition.        
	If Jaswant  once viewed as a hawk in Pakistan when he was Indias foreign minister  has become a hero, the praise is unequivocal for Vajpayee  who began the bus diplomacy with Islamabad but got derailed by Kargil and the Kandahar hijack.        
	Mustansar Javed, a leading writer and analyst, said the harsh reaction of the BJP  which can well earn the sobriquet Banish for Jinnah Praise  signalled the beginning of its downfall in the absence of great visionaries like Vajpayee.        
	Agreed poet and writer Syed Arif. The BJP minus Vajpayee is nothing but a mad rush of people, he said. Vajpayee, Arif added, had the god-gifted ability to handle crises with ease.        
	The criticism in India on the contents of the book only shows intolerance and the narrow-mindedness of certain sections of Hindu society, said Javed.        
	The book, Jinnah: India, Partition, Independence, has not hit the stands in Pakistan yet.         
	By all accounts, Mr Singhs narrative is being seen by those who have seen glimpses of the book as the most important statement, verging on adulation, by a leading Indian public figure of a man otherwise seen as a villain by the Indian middle classes, Dawn newspaper said.        
	The majority of Pakistanis believe that Jinnahs image as a villain in India  someone who carved up the country on communal lines  needs to be changed. Jinnah was being portrayed in India as a villain and Jaswant Singh has tried to remove this distortion, said Fakhar Zaman, chairman of Pakistan Academy of Letters.        
	Zaman said Jaswant had in fact tried to put things in the right perspective and he should not be condemned for his effort.        
	For us, he (Jinnah) was no less than Mahatma Gandhi in terms of his achievements and vision, he added.        
	Jinnah is an icon of statesmanship, vision, character and acumen for 160 million inhabitants of Pakistan. Children call him Baba an expression used in Pakistan for a person held in very high esteem.

                                                                                                               RAW spies in Pak net
          NASIR JAFFRY                              
	Islamabad, Jan. 29: Pakistan police today claimed to have arrested three spies allegedly trained by Indias Research and Analysis Wing to carry out terror strikes in different parts of the country in retaliation against the Mumbai attacks.        
	The three (RAW) agents were arrested on Thursday from a village close to the Indian border, Lahore city police chief Pervaiz Rathore said.        
	The trio, he said, were allegedly working for RAW since 2005. Rathore alleged they were involved in a bus stop bombing outside a Lahore college in 2006 that killed two persons.        
	Rathore, who did not disclose their names, said they were Pakistani citizens who had been tasked by RAW, Indias external espionage agency, to take pictures of important places in the country. Principal religious buildings were their prime targets, he added.        
	The spies, who Rathore claimed had confessed receiving training from their RAW instructors, had been directed to strike at mosques and religious organisations like the Jamaat-ud Dawa, the front of the outlawed Lashkar-e-Toiba, blamed for the Mumbai attacks.        
	The revelation came as a deadline to submit a report on the Mumbai attacks ran out. Officials said they would respond to the Indian dossier on the attacks after wrapping up the probe this weekend. Pakistans interior ministry chief, Rehman Malik, had on January 17 promised to complete the probe in 10 days.

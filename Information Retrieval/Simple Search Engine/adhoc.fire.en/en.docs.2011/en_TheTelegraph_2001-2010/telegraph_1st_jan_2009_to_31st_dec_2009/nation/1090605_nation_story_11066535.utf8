          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 3: First woman President, first woman Speaker  now the first woman officer to protect the Prime Minister.        
	IPS officer Binita Thakur is tipped to be the first woman to join the elite Special Protection Group (SPG), which is in charge of the security of the Prime Minister.        
	The job is different from what she has done so far  fight drug dealers, tame dacoits and tackle violent farmer protests  but the Rajasthan cadre officer of the 1996 batch knows the new assignment is special.        
	I am very happy, but I cant comment unless I get a formal letter from my seniors, Thakur, in her mid-30s, said today. The official intimation could become a birthday present  if it comes on June 6.        
	Thakur will join the SPG  the security shield around Manmohan Singh and his family, as well as former Prime Ministers  as superintendent of police, heading one unit of the crack squad.        
	Sources said she would be part of the outer cordon, among many security layers, when the Prime Minister travels.        
	Among her Rajasthan colleagues, Thakur is known for having spearheaded a crackdown on drug lords of the north in joint operations with Punjab and Haryana police.         
	She is said to be the first officer under whom a detailed list of the regions top 20 peddlers active on the borders had been drawn up.        
	Thakur took on bandits as superintendent of police in Karauli. She also played a key role in containing the farmers agitation against the Vasundhara Raje government for lack of water and irrigation facilities five years ago.        
	Currently posted as assistant inspector-general at the Jaipur police training centre, Thakurs interests go beyond policing: she is said to be pursuing a PhD in zoology.        
	The Special Protection Group was set up after the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. It has about 3,000 personnel drawn from police and National Security Guard commandos. The officer cadre is mainly IPS officers.

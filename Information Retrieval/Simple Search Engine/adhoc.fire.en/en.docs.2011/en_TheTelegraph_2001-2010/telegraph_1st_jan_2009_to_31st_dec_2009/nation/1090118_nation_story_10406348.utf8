          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Jan. 17: Mumbai attacks witness Anita Uddaiya, who claims she was taken to the US for questioning, and her daughter Seema Joshi spent a second day at the crime branch recording their statements after Mumbai police lodged a criminal case against them for providing false information.         
	Uddaiya, who was reported missing by her daughter on Sunday and surfaced on Thursday, told police she had been to Satara. Later, she told the media she went to the US.        
	Additional commissioner of police Deven Bharti said: We lodged an offence under Section 182 of the IPC at the Azad Maidan police station late in the night yesterday.         
	Police officials said the preliminary probe showed Uddaiya had been in Mumbai all the time. The airport and visa records do not show any record of her alleged travel. We are verifying her mobile phone records, an officer said.         
	Uddaiyas sister answered her mobile phone. She and her daughter were called to the crime branch in the morning, and have not yet returned home, the woman said.

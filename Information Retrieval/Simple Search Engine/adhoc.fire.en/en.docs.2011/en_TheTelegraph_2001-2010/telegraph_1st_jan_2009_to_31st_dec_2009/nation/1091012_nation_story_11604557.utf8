          OUR BUREAU AND PTI                              
	Mumbai, Oct. 11: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today sidestepped a question whether Maoists are terrorists but ruled out the use of the armed forces against the guerrillas.        
	They (the Naxalites) are banned organisations and are covered under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, he said in response to a question if there were any plans to declare Left extremist groups as terror outfits.        
	We are not in favour of using the armed forces against the Naxalites. The paramilitary forces and police are adequate (to counter the extremists), he told a news conference here.        
	Speaking in the poll-bound state where 17 policemen were killed by the Maoists last week, the Prime Minister pointed out: The government is aware of their evil designs. We will take effective measures to counter them.        
	However, he also stressed on the need to explore the causes that alienate people, particularly tribals, from the mainstream. The growth of Naxalism, particularly in central India, also obliges us to look at what it is that causes the sense of alienation, Singh said.        
	Singh iterated his view that Naxalism was the biggest internal security threat, adding that a dialogue was possible only if violence was shunned.        
	Why the Naxalites alone, the government is prepared to have a dialogue with even the terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir if they abjure violence, he said.

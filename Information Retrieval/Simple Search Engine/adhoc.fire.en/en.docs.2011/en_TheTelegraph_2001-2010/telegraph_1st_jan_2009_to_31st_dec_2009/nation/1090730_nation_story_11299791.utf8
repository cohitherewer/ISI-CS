                                                                                                               PM triggers climate change
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 29: The BJP thought it was a windfall, but the Prime Minister knocked the wind out of its sails.        
	By the time Manmohan Singh was through with his speech in the Lok Sabha today on the Egypt joint statement with Pakistan, the governments main rival had gone silent.        
	Party veteran Sushma Swarajs response reflected the BJPs desolation. She asked two questions, one on climate change and the other on fuel enrichment and reprocessing, but nothing about her partys prime concern  the joint statement that the BJP had thought was a political windfall that would help it turn the tide after the debilitating electoral defeat.        
	Even Yashwant Sinha, who had asked several questions related to Pakistan before the Prime Minister spoke, chose to remain silent.         
	The BJP had painted a grim picture after the joint statement, creating an impression that Singh had bartered away national interest and broken the consensus on foreign policy.         
	Leader of Opposition L.K. Advani had earlier led a walkout from the Lok Sabha on the issue and the entire NDA had marched to President Pratibha Patil yesterday asking her to intervene and stop the surrender to Pakistan.        
	Today, the partys meek response after the Prime Ministers speech was in sharp contrast to the hype generated by Sinha who said the collapse of the pillars of Indian democracy was almost like the cracking of Delhi Metro pillars.        
	Sinha warned that the mention of violence-racked Balochistan  where Pakistan has intermittently alleged a covert Indian hand  would haunt India for long and said the concrete pillars could be raised again but the collapse of diplomatic pillars would lower Indias prestige forever.        
	The former foreign minister, who initiated the debate, described the Indo-Pak statement as the worst mistake in the history of independent India and said the shame of Sharm-el-Sheikh could not be washed away even with waters of seven oceans.        
	Sinha recalled that Singh had talked tough with Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari a month earlier. So what had forced the turnaround in such a short period.        
	Singh silenced him by saying the change lay in Pakistans admission of its role in the Mumbai attacks and the progress made in the investigation as demonstrated in the dossier that Islamabad had handed to India.         
	Sinhas arguments against the sagacity of dialogue with Pakistan after the Mumbai attacks also created embarrassing moments for the BJP. Congress member P.C. Chacko responded by recalling that the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government had invited General Pervez Musharraf after the Kargil incursion.

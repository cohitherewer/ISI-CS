The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rare graft probe against Ignou boss
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Rare graft probe against Ignou boss
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 21: The Central Vigilance Commission will itself probe allegations that Ignou chief V.N. Rajasekaran Pillai tweaked norms to favour particular firms, in a rare move that could embarrass the human resource development ministry.        
	Less than a month ago, the commission had asked the HRD ministry to probe the charges against the vice-chancellor. Now, in a letter to the ministry that has been accessed by The Telegraph, Indias apex watchdog against government corruption has said the nature of the allegations has persuaded it to take up the inquiry itself.        
	The allegations listed in complaints by faculty members to the commission include suggestions that HRD ministry insiders may be shielding Pillai. Commission sources said they had not found any prima facie evidence of norms violation by ministry officials in this case, and were not probing any ministry officials role.        
	But the sources confirmed that the commission had decided to conduct its own probe into the allegations against Pillai because the fairness of an HRD ministry probe cannot be guaranteed. The commissions decision amounts to a show of no-confidence in the ministry that governs Indias education.        
	The decision is potentially embarrassing for HRD minister Kapil Sibal, who has repeatedly said he wants to bring in reforms aimed at ending corruption and malpractice in education.        
	The panelss decision coincides with Ignous formal reply to the the ministry on the charges, in which the vice-chancellor has denied any bias towards specific private firms.        
	Under government norms, central universities like Ignou must undergo a rigorous tendering process to select any private firm for a project. But as reported by this newspaper, Pillai faces allegations of bias towards specific private firms.        
	The commission is investigating allegations that Pillai flew on a chartered flight with a senior IBM official to sign a pact with the Bihar government that documents suggest could benefit the IT firm.        
	IBM has confirmed to this newspaper that it was invited to the signing ceremony before the company was formally selected through any tendering process.        
	Pillai also faces allegations of starting a slew of courses in collaboration with private firms and agencies without mandatory sanction from academic regulatory authorities. These courses, the complaints to the commission have alleged, are aimed at benefiting these private firms and agencies.        
	The vice-chancellor, in his defence submitted to the ministry, has accepted he flew on a chartered flight to Patna with an IBM official but claimed the complainant has misunderstood his motives, sources said. Pillai has denied any official norms were violated in starting the courses.

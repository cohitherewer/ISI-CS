The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Karat date eludes Amar
                                                                                                               Karat date eludes Amar
          JAYANTH JACOB                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 4: Amar Singhs attempts to meet Prakash Karat have failed amid signs the CPM general secretary isnt keen on Samajwadi leaders overtures for an Uttar Pradesh alliance for now.        
	Sources said Karat was of the view that there is no meeting ground now with the Samajwadis, though CPM sources said a tie-up cannot be ruled out in the near future.        
	Amar fears the Left could ask its cadres to vote for the BSP in the Lok Sabha seats where the communists do not put up candidates, like it had done in the May 2007 Assembly polls that had swept BSP chief Mayavati to power.        
	The attempts to meet the CPM leader mark a turnaround for Amar, who has been critical of the CPM, especially Karat, since the Samajwadis rescued the Congress-led UPA government after the communists withdrew support over the nuclear deal.         
	Amar has told CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan about his intention to meet Karat. The Samajwadi general secretary was hoping for a date today.         
	The CPM is not unaware of the role the Samajwadis can play in the Lefts larger plan to bring in a non-Congress, non-BJP government at the Centre. However, that is an option to be looked at only after the Lok Sabha elections are over, CPM sources said.         
	The Samajwadis and the Left have had a friendly past. But one should also take into account the circumstances under which the relations soured, a CPM leader said.

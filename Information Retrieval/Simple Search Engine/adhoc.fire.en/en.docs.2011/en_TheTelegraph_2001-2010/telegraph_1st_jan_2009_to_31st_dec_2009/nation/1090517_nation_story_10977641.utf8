	Thiruvananthapuram, May 16: The Opposition Congress-led United Democratic Front has swept the polls in Kerala, winning 16 seats and conceding a mere four to the ruling Left coalition which went to the elections with 18 seats.        
	Out of the 17 seats it contested, the Congress won 13. From nil representation last time, the Congresss remarkable victories have been in the capital of Thirvananthapuram and the states north, for long believed to be impregnable fortresses of the CPM. Its been a major surge for the Congress, which had no representation from Kerala in the outgoing Lok Sabha.        
	Four victories in the Left camp have gone to the CPM. Left allies, the CPI and the Kerala Congress (Joseph), which contested three and one seat each respectively, drew a blank. Janata Dal (S), Congress (S) and RSP were not in the fray as the CPM took away their seats.        
	The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), the Congress ally, which fought to regain its hold over the Muslim community, won both Malappuram and Ponnani by huge margins, avenging its shock defeat in Manjeri in 2004. Its resurgence for the League, which it lost key seats even in the Assembly elections in 2006.        
	The LDF vote share slipped from 46 per cent in 2004 to 41.5 per cent while the UDF increased its share from 38 percent to 47.5 per cent, according to initial estimates. BJP, which failed to open its electoral account, polled 6.5 per cent of the votes.        
	In Thiruvananthapuram, former UN diplomat Shashi Tharoor won by nearly 99,998 votes, fighting the outsider image and the Left vilification campaign against him of being pro-Israel. The huge margin indicates the huge expectation of the people. Ive to live up to it, he told the media, surrounded by boisterous supporters in the city.         
	The Congress wrested the CPM fortresses of Kannur, Kozhikode and Vadakara, indicating the voter apathy for the politics of violence. Congress leader K. Sudhakaran, the sitting MLA, defeated CPM youth leader K.K. Ragesh by 43,151 votes.              
	In Vadakara, former Union minister Mullapally Ramachandran defeated Sathi Devi, the sitting MP, by 56,667 votes.        
	CPM winners are A. Sampath, P.K. Biju (Alathur), M.B. Rajesh (Palakkad) and P. Karunakaran (Kasargod).        
	In the UDF, Kerala Congress leader K.M. Manis son, Jose K. Mani, won the Kottayam seat, defeating the veteran MP, K. Suresh Kurup (CPM).         
	Other Congress winners are N. Peethambara Kurup (Kollam), Kodikkunnil Suresh (Mavelikara), P.T. Thomas (Idukki), K.C. Venugopal ( Alappuzha), K V Thomas (Ernakulam), P C Chacko (Thrissur) and M.K. Raghavan (Kozhikode).         
	There will be three by-elections in Kerala soon since all three sitting MLAs, fielded by the Congress have won and they will have to resign their membership of the assembly.         
	This looks like the end of the road for ageing leader K. Karunakarans son, K Muraleeddharan, the state president of the Nationalist Congress Party. He lost in Wayanad, polling 99,663 votes in the third slot against Congress general secretary M.I. Shanavas, who notched the highest margin of 153,439 votes in the state and posted his debut electoral victory.        
	Chronic infighting in the CPM, the arrogance of the CPM leadership, CPMs ties with the PDP which were resented by even the Left allies and the Lavalin case against CPM state secretary are principal state-level reasons for the shock defeat of the Left Democratic Front, especially the CPM.

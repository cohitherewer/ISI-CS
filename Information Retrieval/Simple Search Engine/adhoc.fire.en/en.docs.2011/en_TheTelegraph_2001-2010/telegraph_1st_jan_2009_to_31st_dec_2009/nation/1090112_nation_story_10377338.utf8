The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Have 3 kids? Pay Rs 10000
                                                                                                               Have 3 kids? Pay Rs 10000
          CITHARA PAUL                               
	Thiruvananthapuram, Jan. 11: A couple who have more than two children should have to pay a fine of Rs 10,000, the law commission appointed by the CPM government in Kerala is set to recommend.         
	The commission report, to be submitted to the government on January 24, also suggests that privileges such as free elementary education should be withheld for couples with more than two children.        
	The proposal has angered Christian leaders.         
	This proposal is not acceptable as its a direct infringement on ones rights. Its a repeat of the Draconian laws existing in China which prohibit having a second child, said Stephen Alathara, spokesperson for the Kerala Catholic Bishops Conference.        
	For Christians it is the canon law which matters and not laws framed here, Alathara added.        
	Only a few months ago, the Catholic Church had through pastoral letters urged its followers to have more children to strengthen the community in the state.         
	The Church is also against a proposal for legalising euthanasia and another that suggests transferring all Church properties to a trust.         
	The commission headed by Justice (retired) Krishna Iyer, who was law minister in the first Kerala cabinet headed by E.M.S. Namboodiripad in the fifties, has made several other radical suggestions.        
	One that is bound to raise eyebrows in the ruling Left is to make it mandatory for political parties to give a weeks notice to authorities before calling a bandh. Punishment for violation of the rule would be a fine of Rs 10 lakh or three years in prison for party leaders. Parties should also have to pay compensation if any individual suffers damage during a bandh, the report says.        
	In 2007, Left-ruled Kerala saw more than 200 strikes, most of them political.        
	Iyer has announced plans to form a committee to ensure that the commissions recommendations are implemented. Everything depends on the political willpower of the LDF government, said a member of the commission.         
	Law minister M. Vijayakumar was non-committal. The government will take a final decision after going through the report, he told The Telegraph.        
	All major communities in Kerala are opposing one or another of the recommendations.         
	The report talks in detail about polygamy among Muslims and says it is not acceptable. It should be allowed only in extraordinary circumstances and that too with the permission of the first wife, it adds.

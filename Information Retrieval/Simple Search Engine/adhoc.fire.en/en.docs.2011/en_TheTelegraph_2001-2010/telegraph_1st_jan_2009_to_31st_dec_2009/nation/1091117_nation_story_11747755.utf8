          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Nov. 16: The ban on plying of old and unfit buses received a fresh push with Orissa High Court seeking an explanation from the government as to how such vehicles were still managing to get fitness certificates.        
	The court directed the state transport department to submit an affidavit by November 25, explaining the norms adopted for giving fitness certificates to buses.        
	The division bench of Justice B.P. Das and Justice Indrajeet Mohanty also expressed reservations over the governments insincerity in implementing the ban and also directed the transport authorities to file affidavits on steps taken to enforce the ban.        
	The order was passed after it was pointed out during hearing of a PIL on Friday that even assembled buses without specific models were managing to get fitness certificates.        
	The PIL assumes significance as at least 38 people die in every 100 road mishaps in Orissa. This is well above the national average of 25. Besides, at least eight persons die on an average everyday in road accidents in the state. The high court has been pressing for withdrawal of buses that are old and unfit for plying after conducting a fresh round of fitness tests across the state for over two years now.        
	While hearing the PIL, the court, in its interim order in July 2007, had also banned granting permits for plying buses in Orissa whose registration had been cancelled in other states.         
	In fact, an SOS from the advocate-generals office to the chief secretary on September 8, 2009, indicated that the court wanted from the state, particularly the chief secretary, to intervene in the matter and find out whether the necessary amendment in the act can be made to restrict the plying of very old transport commercial vehicles.        
	Fitness of buses, tyres, body, upholstery, brake, engine, steering and lights are never checked meticulously. Nor is the emission standards, the petitions alleged, regularly checked.         
	The transport authorities always cry hoarse that the old and unfit buses are responsible for most of the accidents, but seldom take tangible steps to off-load these vehicles from roads.

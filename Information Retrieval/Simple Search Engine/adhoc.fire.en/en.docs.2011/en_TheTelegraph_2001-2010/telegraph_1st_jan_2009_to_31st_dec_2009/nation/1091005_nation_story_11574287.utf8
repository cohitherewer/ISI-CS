The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PMK walks out on Jaya
                                                                                                               PMK walks out on Jaya
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chennai, Oct. 4: The PMK today quit the ADMK front it had joined on the eve of the May Lok Sabha elections. The partys executive committee took the decision at an emergency meeting at Tindivanam, 140km from here.        
	The PMK had quit the UPA just before the elections to join the front led by ADMK boss Jayalalithaa despite efforts by former allies Congress and the DMK to dissuade it.        
	The provocation for the divorce was the ADMKs move to challenge a courts decision to remove the names of PMK founder S. Ramadoss and his son, former Union minister Anbumani Ramadoss, from a murder chargesheet.        
	An ADMK functionary was killed in a mob attack by PMK cadres in Tindivanam during the 2006 Assembly elections. The then Jayalalithaa government had included the names of the PMK founder, his son and three relatives in the list of accused, but the subsequent DMK government removed the names before the chargesheet was filed.        
	Tindivanam MLA and former minister C.V. Shanmugam, who had filed complaints against the PMK leaders, had challenged the removal of the names from the chargesheet. However, his petition was dismissed by a sessions court.        
	The ADMK leadership recently permitted Shanmugam to challenge the lower courts order in the high court.         
	After this development, the PMK can have no friendly relationship with the ADMK and decides that there is no need to continue any ties with that party, a PMK resolution said.        
	This is a first step in our move to return to the UPA but that will happen only after the DMK and Congress make up their minds, said a PMK MLA.        
	As part of the ADMK front, the PMK had fared miserably in the Lok Sabha elections, losing in all the seven seats it had contested in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.        
	Indications are the CPM might also snap ties with the ADMK.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhopal, July 7: The blasts didnt just kill, they ripped apart identities.        
	Tragedy struck on Sunday night in Singrauli, Madhya Pradesh, when flames from a boiler that apparently burst sparked an inferno in two explosives manufacturing factories, killing dozens of workers in the countrys energy and mining capital.        
	Till afternoon today, most of the bodies had not been identified and wailing wives and mothers fought over body parts at the post-mortem centre in Waidhan, the district headquarters of Singrauli over 750km from Bhopal.        
	Anita, a mother of two, clung to a disfigured body saying it was of her husband Vijay Kumar Panika. A couple from the neighbouring Sidhi district also staked claim to the body, saying it was of their son Pankaj Soni.        
	While Anita and the Sonis argued, another family insisted that the body was of their son Suresh who was driving a tractor when the explosion ripped through the two factories.        
	Distraught relatives clutched a leg or a hand, pointing to old wounds to back their claim. It was a terrible and unfortunate sight, said a doctor at Waidhan.        
	The exact cause of the explosions at Indian Detonators, Rajasthan Chemical Explosives Ltd and Ideal Company in Baliyari, Waidhan, is still not clear. But informed sources said a boiler at Rajasthan Chemical burst and the blaze engulfed Indian Detonators and Ideal Company.        
	Most of those who died were non-technical staff and may have ignored safety norms, the sources added.        
	Eyewitnesses said the blasts were so severe that both factories were completely destroyed. According to district collector P. Narhari, 16 bodies had been recovered so far and 25 people with serious injuries had been hospitalised.        
	Collector Narhari said rescue operations were on but chances of finding more survivors had receded, even as the area remained without power for the past 48 hours. Chief minister Shivraj Chauhan has ordered a magisterial probe.        
	Singrauli is considered the countrys energy and mining capital as it houses units of Northern Coalfields Limited, power major NTPC, Hindalco and Essar Power Ltd.

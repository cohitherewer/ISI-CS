          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, July 17: With the Union health ministry deciding to keep in abeyance with Medical Council of Indias recommendation for MBBS seat slash at VSS Medical College, speculation that the state-run institution may not be allowed to admit students against all its 150 MBBS seats for 2009-10 has been put to rest.        
	The ministrys communication on Thursday has sent a clear signal that it was willing to give the government a year more to comply with the MCI guidelines, official sources said.        
	Though VSS Medical College (Burla) was allowed to increase intake from 107 to 150 for the 2007-08 and the 2008-09 sessions, the MCI had asked the health ministry to reduce 43 seats for the 2009-10 session, as the college failed to meet MCI requirements.        
	The MCI had noted persisting vacancies in teaching faculty and inadequacies in infrastructure such as shortage of beds in the casualty ward. T        
	he increase in seat intake was on the condition that the institution meets MCI norms every year for renewal of permission for a period of five years.         
	A MCI inspection team had visited the medical college in July and submitted an adverse compliance verification report.        
	Counselling for 150 seats at SCB Medical College and MKCG Medical College, each, was held on July 12. But, counselling was held for only 107 MBBS seats of VSS Medical College was held with them, pending decision of health ministry on the MCI recommendation.        
	With Union health ministry renewing all 150 seats at VSS medical college we have fixed July 18 to hold counselling for the rest 43 seats, said a senior health department official today.         
	Meanwhile, a similar adverse compliance verification report by the Dental Council of India (DCI) on the Dental Institute under the SCB Medical College in Cuttack has triggered speculation that the number of seats for the bachelor in dental surgery (BDS) will be slashed for 2009-10.        
	BDS course was introduced in the institute with 20 seats in 1983. Though there were three state-run medical colleges in Orissa, the SCB was the only one that offered BDS.         
	In 2007, the Union health ministry had allowed an increase in the number of seats to 50 keeping in view of increasing demand for the course in the state. Again, it was on the condition that the SCB would meet DCI norms every year for renewal of permission for four years.        
	A DCI team had submitted a compliance verification report after inspecting the institute in April. The report had recommended to the Union health ministry for reduction of 30 seats for 2009-10 as the institute failed to meet the requirements laid down by the DCI.

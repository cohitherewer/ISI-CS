	Calcutta, March 24: A popular radio jockey of an FM station in Salt Lake has filed molestation charges against the visiting chief executive officer who allegedly fled soon after.        
	Police sources said two officials of the radio station, located at Millennium Tower in Salt Lakes Sector V, had been detained for questioning.        
	According to the complaint, the RJ was late for a surprise meeting with the CEO from Delhi.

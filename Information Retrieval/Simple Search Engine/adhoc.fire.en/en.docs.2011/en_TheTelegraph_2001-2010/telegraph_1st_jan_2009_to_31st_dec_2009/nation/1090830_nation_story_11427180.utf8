The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Amar   cash-scam finger at Kulkarni
                                                                                                               Amar   cash-scam finger at Kulkarni
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                    
	New Delhi, Aug. 29: Samajwadi general secretary Amar Singh today gave L.K. Advani and Arun Jaitley a clean chit in the cash-for-vote scam, blaming former BJP associate Sudheendra Kulkarni for misusing the senior leaders.        
	Advani and Arun Jaitley were misused by Sudheendra Kulkarni, Amar told reporters through a videoconference from Singapore, where he is recovering after a kidney transplant.        
	The scam rocked Parliament in July 2008 in the middle of the nuclear deal debate after three BJP MPs waved wads of notes, claiming an advance from the Samajwadi Party, which was supporting the government, to abstain from the trust vote. A television channel aired a sting operation that purportedly showed the involvement of the Samajwadis.        
	The conciliatory tone towards the BJP leaders came days after Amar described as a historic blunder the Samajwadi decision to support the UPA government.        
	Amar accused Kulkarni  a key Advani aide who formally snapped his active association with the BJP a few days ago  of organising the sting operation, and asked minorities to analyse why the Congress-led UPA was supporting him.        
	The allusion was probably to Kulkarnis inclusion in an important ministerial committee of the railways, headed by Congress ally Mamata Banerjee. Though Kulkarni, who helped craft policies for Mamata during her earlier stint as railway minister in the BJP-led NDA regime, is back with Mamata, he hasnt joined her Trinamul Congress.        
	Amar said his party was not with the BJP but his relations with its leaders were excellent. He also said Jaitley and his wife were coming to Singapore to visit him.

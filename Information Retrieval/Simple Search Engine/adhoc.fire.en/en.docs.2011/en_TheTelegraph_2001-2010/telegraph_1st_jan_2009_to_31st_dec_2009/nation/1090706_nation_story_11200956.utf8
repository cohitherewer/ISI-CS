The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Maneka jab at PM on Varun safety
                                                                                                               Maneka jab at PM on Varun safety
          OUR BUREAU AND PTI                              Maneka, Singh				                                 
	New Delhi, July 5: Maneka Gandhi today wrote to the Prime Minister accusing his government of being lackadaisical towards the security threat to Varun Gandhi, her son and fellow BJP member of Parliament.        
	It is with the deepest concern for my sons life and safety that I write to you today, the letter said a day after Delhi police claimed to have arrested six men from the Chhota Shakeel gang who allegedly planned to kill one of Varuns lawyer.        
	I find it bizarre that we have never been informed of any attempts or even been advised on any security precautions. We simply learn through the media, Maneka told Manmohan Singh.        
	The former Union minister has been worried about Varuns safety since his hate speech against Muslims during the election campaign. Sources said Maneka was not getting the support she was looking for from BJP leaders.        
	Maneka accused the government of a vicious and orchestrated campaign against Varun because he was a political threat.         
	When Varun met the home minister (P. Chidambaram), the latter was so arrogant and careless of his duties that he simply informed him that he could not protect everyone in the country. It is as if you want Varun Gandhi to be killed.        
	Maneka complained the Delhi police commissioner had refused to confirm to her that Varun was the gangs target. I am amazed at the lackadaisical attitude of your government.        
	She said she and Varun should be kept informed of such developments so we can protect ourselves.        
	Varun, 29, said in a separate statement that while he was not intimidated by such threats, precautions must be taken to defeat extremists designs. The home ministry should respond with the urgency and responsibility that behoves those entrusted with the safety of a whole nation.        
	Delhi police have not specified who among Varuns lawyers was the target. His case against the Uttar Pradesh governments use of the National Security Act against him was fought by a battery of lawyers, including Mukul Rohatgi and Sidharth Luthra.        
	The Congress described Manekas outbursts as ironical, spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi comparing her strong reaction now with her alleged lack of concern after Varuns speech had created the biggest upheaval and divided society. He added that the UPA government has always provided even-handed protection to every citizen and shall continue to do so.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CBSE asks students for advice on exam
                                                                                                               CBSE asks students for advice on exam
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 10: Indias largest school board is asking its students for their perception of the Class X public examination that it is considering making optional.        
	The Central Board of Secondary Education has launched an online survey that asks students, teachers, parents and principals of affiliated schools to share their views and concerns on the examination.         
	The identities of all those who answer will be kept confidential, the survey says.         
	This is the first time the board is involving children in planned reforms, which will affect them the most.         
	The results of the survey will be critical in formulating a new school education vision aimed at reducing academic and examination burdens on students, while making learning more enjoyable, senior CBSE officials told The Telegraph. The survey can be answered on the boards website, www.cbse.nic, from today.         
	Human resource development minister Kapil Sibal has already held meetings with public school principals over his plan to make the Class X CBSE examination optional.         
	The survey asks students at schools affiliated to the CBSE a set of 46 multiple-choice questions on the emotions they experience while preparing for the public examination at the end of Class X.         
	The students are asked whether they feel pressure to complete their syllabus early, whether they believe marks are the only way to assess my worth and if the examination motivates  or demotivates  them to study.         
	Sibal has argued that students who wish to continue in the same school after Class X should be exempt from the board examination. But several schools only retain in Class XI students who have performed well in their Class X board exam.         
	The questionnaire for students asks them whether they feel pressure of getting a good stream in the same school or admission in a different school.         
	It also seeks their opinion on textbook-based learning, and whether they will prefer continuous and comprehensive evaluation to a public examination as an assessment technique.         
	The students are asked whether they suffer from any health-related symptoms while preparing for the examination  sweaty palms, shaking hands, breathing problems, anxiety attacks, eating disorders, irritability or tiredness.         
	A longer questionnaire  with 76 queries  for parents attempts to map the effects of the Class X board examination on guardians and, through them, on their wards.         
	The parents are asked whether they are unable to concentrate on their job or other work during the examination and if they feel worried for their childs future if the scores are poor.         
	The questionnaire seeks to squeeze out of parents answers on their perceptions of teaching in their childs school and asks whether they feel their child is under pressure or playing and speaking to friends too little.         
	It tries to capture parental concerns  over rushed teaching at school or the childs health  specifically asking them whether they feel guilty watching television while their child is studying.         
	Two other independent questionnaires  for teachers and principals  complete the survey.         
	The teachers are asked about their priorities while teaching Class X students  whether they are more concerned about covering the syllabus and enabling students to score better, even if students dont learn much as a consequence.         
	The survey also tries to trace through a series of queries the pressure teachers face in ensuring their students perform in the examination.         
	The principals are asked about any observation of students being increasingly dependent on learning by rote to perform in the boards, and about concerns over their schools performance.

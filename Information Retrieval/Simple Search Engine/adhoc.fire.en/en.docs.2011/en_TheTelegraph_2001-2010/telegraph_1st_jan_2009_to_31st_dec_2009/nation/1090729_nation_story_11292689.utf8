                                                                                                               BJP, Cong allege scheme anomalies
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          BJP protests irregularities in schemes in Bhubaneswar. (Sanjib Mukherjee)                                  
	Bhubaneswar, July 28: The Opposition today demanded a CBI or vigilance probe into widespread irregularities and corruption in implementation of government schemes in Koraput-Bolangir-Kalahandi (KBK) districts.        
	However, the government rejected the demand, asserting that no specific allegation had come to its notice. Angry Congress members then rushed to the well saying that they had evidence.        
	If allegation with concrete evidence is brought to the notice of the government, it will be probed. Stern action will be initiated against erring officials, said agriculture and co-operation minister Damodar Rout who was responding on behalf of the government.        
	Earlier moving an adjournment motion on the matter, senior Congress member S.S. Saluja alleged that officials had taken 10 per cent commission for all projects executed under the Western Orissa Development Council in 2004-09.         
	Alleging that the guidelines for the MP Local Area Development Fund (MP LAD) and MLA Local Area Development Fund (MLA LAD fund) programmes were flouted, Saluja claimed that funds from the MPs LAD fund was released for a building in his Assembly constituency on a private plot owned by former BJD legislator Mohammed Ayub Khan.        
	The former Bolangir collector had objected to the proposal. But, he was transferred soon after. The matter was also brought to the notice of a House committee that was visiting the district. However, the committee ignored violations, said the Opposition leader.        
	Similarly, more than 50 per cent funds released under the revised long term action plan for KBK remained unspent, alleged Saluja, who hails from the KBK region.        
	Flouting guidelines, work orders were issued on the recommendation of MLAs, said the Opposition. Citing an instance, Congress legislator Prafulla Majhi claimed that funds were released from the MPs LAD fund of Rajya Sabha member Mangala Kisan to an engineering college in Sundergarh.        
	Alleging that crores were being siphoned off, the Opposition demanded a CBI or vigilance probe.

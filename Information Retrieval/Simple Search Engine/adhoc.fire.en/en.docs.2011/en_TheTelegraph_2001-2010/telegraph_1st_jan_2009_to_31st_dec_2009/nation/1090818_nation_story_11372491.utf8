The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Fierce lobbying costs Karnataka an IIT
                                                                                                               Fierce lobbying costs Karnataka an IIT
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           Sibal, Moily: Pulls and pressures                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 17: Kapil Sibal has decided what a former Prime Minister, the Union law minister and a chief minister cant seem to  the location of an Indian Institute of Technology in Karnataka.        
	His decision is: nowhere.        
	The human resource development minister has formally rejected demands for an IIT in Karnataka during the XIth Five Year Plan, rebuffing lobbying from top leaders across party lines seeking the institute in their fiefs.        
	Sibals decision follows independent demands from law minister Veerappa Moily and former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda for an IIT  in their respective Lok Sabha constituencies  top government officials have told The Telegraph.        
	Karnataka chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa has also written to Sibal demanding an IIT in the state.        
	The Centre has no funds to start an IIT in the state that heralded Indias arrival at the global IT high table, Sibal has told his cabinet colleague Moily in a letter, top sources said.        
	Similar letters from Sibal are about to be sent by the HRD ministry to Gowda and Yeddyurappa, the sources said.         
	Sibals decision puts the lid on a campaign to get Karnataka an IIT that started during the drafting of the XIth plan and picked up steam after the state was not listed among beneficiaries initially.        
	This is the end of the road for Karnatakas dream for an IIT during the ongoing five year plan despite the immense political pressure, a source said. The XIth plan period ends in 2012.         
	Law minister Moily, of the Congress, had written to Sibal last month requesting an IIT in his Lok Sabha constituency Chikkaballapur, the sources said.         
	The sources also revealed that Gowda, of the Janata Dal (Secular), had written to the minister demanding an IIT in Hassan, his Lok Sabha constituency.        
	Karnataka chief minister Yeddyurappa, of the BJP, also wants an IIT, ideally in the northern part of the state that is emerging as a stronghold for the party, it is learnt.         
	Moily and Gowda have also previously been chief ministers of Karnataka.        
	The fact that the demands from the Karnataka leaders were so obviously political  with them seeking IITs in their zones of interest  helped us battle the political pressure. They dont care about Karnataka, a senior government official here said.        
	The UPA had initially promised three new IITs  in Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Bihar  under the XIth plan, but later decided to also open IITs in Punjab, Gujarat, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh.        
	Sibal has argued in his letter to Moily that all funds allocated to the HRD ministry under the XIth plan for starting new IITs had been earmarked for the eight promised institutes. So, it will not be possible for the ministry to start an IIT in Karnataka during the current plan, Sibal is learnt to have written.         
	We have faced such lobbying for IITs in specific constituencies before too, but never from such senior political leaders, a senior official said.        
	Although Rajasthan was among the first three states to be awarded an IIT under the XIth plan, the location of the institute has been at the centre of a political battle. Former BJP chief minister Vasundhara Raje Scindia wanted the IIT at Kota, the closest major town to her fiefdom of Jhalawar.        
	During the recent Lok Sabha elections, candidates of both the Congress and the BJP in different cities promised that they would bring the IIT to their constituency.

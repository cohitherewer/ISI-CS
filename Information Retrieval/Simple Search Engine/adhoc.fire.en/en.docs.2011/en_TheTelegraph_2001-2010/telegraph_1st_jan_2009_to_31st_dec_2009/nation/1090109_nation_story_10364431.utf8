The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Gaza balm minus rap on Israel
                                                                                                               Gaza balm minus rap on Israel
          JOHN MARY                              
	Kannur, Jan. 8: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh chose his trip to Muslim-dominated Malabar today to criticise the killing of civilians in Gaza, but he did not name Israel.        
	He used the word condemn, which the Indian official reaction has avoided, but, in a carefully worded statement, directed it at the hostilities in Gaza.        
	I strongly condemn (the) hostilities taking place in Gaza and express dismay at the unfortunate killing of hundreds of innocent civilians, Singh said. We call for the immediate cessation of hostilities so that a settlement based on dialogue can be arrived at.        
	Delhi, faced with calls to carry out surgical strikes on Pakistan-based terrorists following the Mumbai attacks, has avoided condemning Israel for its objective of targeting Hamas militants in Gaza.        
	The Prime Minister, however, expressed Indias traditional support for the Palestinian cause.        
	I reiterate our unstinted and unwavering support to the just Palestine cause. This is an area of special priority for India and over the next decade and more, this focus would only intensify further, Singh said while inaugurating the Indian Naval Academy at Ezhimala, 35km from Kannur in northern Kerala.        
	Sharing the dais was junior external affairs minister E. Ahmed, who looked relieved at Singhs statement. Ahmeds party, the Indian Union Muslim League, had this week urged the Centre to break its diplomatic ties with Israel.

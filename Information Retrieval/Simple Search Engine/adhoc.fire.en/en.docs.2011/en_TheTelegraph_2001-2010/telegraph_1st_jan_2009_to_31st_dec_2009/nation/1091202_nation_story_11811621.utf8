The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Safety tussle over brinjals

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 1: Activists campaigning against genetically modified (GM) crops have questioned the process through which such brinjals were approved by a government panel last month, but panel members said they were satisfied with the safety data.         
	The Coalition for GM-free India has demanded the withdrawal of the approval after one of the members of the panel released an affidavit claiming that the panels chairperson had said he was under tremendous pressure to clear the GM brinjal.         
	The Genetic Engineering Approval Committee, the governments apex safety-review panel for genetically engineered products, had on October 14 approved the release of GM brinjal into the environment, turning it into Indias first edible GM crop ready for cultivation. One of the members of the panel, P.M. Bhargava, had dissented, arguing that several safety tests still needed to be carried out.         
	The committee had asked an expert panel to examine safety data on the brinjal.         
	Bhargava, who is a Supreme Court nominee to the panel, has now claimed in a signed affidavit that the committees chairman Arjula Reddy had in a telephonic talk confided to him that he was under tremendous pressure to clear the brinjal and had received calls from the agriculture minister, the GEAC, and industry.         
	The coalition released Bhargavas affidavit to the media yesterday, saying it showed that the committee set up to examine the safety data  based on animal toxicity studies on the brinjal  was under pressure to approve the product.         
	However, Reddy told The Telegraph over the phone today that he had been quoted out of context by Bhargava.         
	Dr Bhargava had suggested many additional tests  but these are not prescribed by Indian regulatory authorities, Reddy said.         
	Yes, certainly, more tests can be done... but then there would be no end to such testing. What I had said was that if we insist on such tests, we may come under pressure from industry, Reddy said.         
	Another committee member said that although several of the animal toxicology studies that Bhargava had suggested had not been done, the 90-day animal feeding studies appeared adequate.         
	Feeding a rodent the genetically modified crop for 90 days is equivalent to feeding a human being something from birth to 25 years of age, said B. Sesikeran, director of the National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad.         
	The ultimate human safety data comes from humans studies  and we know that the protein in this brinjal has also been used to modify other edible crops that have been consumed by people in other countries for several years, Sesikeran said.

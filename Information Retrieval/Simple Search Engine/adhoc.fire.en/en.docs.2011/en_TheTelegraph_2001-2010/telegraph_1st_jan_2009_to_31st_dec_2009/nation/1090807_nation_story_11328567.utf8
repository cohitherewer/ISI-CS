          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Aug. 6: The first suspected swine flu case was reported at Cuttack city after a man, who recently returned from Singapore, was isolated in a special ward set up at SCB Medical College and Hospital to treat H1N1 patients.         
	The 36-year-old marine engineer, who reached the special ward at 12.30pm from Bhubaneswar, believed that he had symptoms of swine flu. Doctors said that the symptoms were yet to be established. Birendra Kumar Patra landed in Bhubaneswar recently from Singapore, via Mumbai, after an eight-month cruise. He had been staying with his family in a rented house at VSS Nagar.        
	The Swine Flu Response Team (SFRT) advised him to undergo tests at the ward, which has the required wherewithal, including a 12-bed isolation unit and 6-bed quarantine unit. The SFRT is headed by Dr D.P. Das, the SCB head of the department of pulmonary medicine, as its nodal officer. Doctors of pulmonary medicine and allied departments are also a part of SFRT.        
	SCB superintendent D.N. Maharana said there was no need for panic as the engineers case was yet to be confirmed. Patra has been suffering from cold since July 5, he said.         
	We will take the necessary tests. The required throat and nasal swabs and blood samples were sent to National Institute of Virology at Pune today. In the meantime, he will be kept in isolation till reports are received, said hospital superintendent while talking to The Telegraph.        
	The special ward, only of its kind in the state, and one of the 34 in the country, has been in service at the SCB since July 20 to screen patients who have visible signs of flu, fever or upper respiratory infection.        
	Nurses have been put on 24 hour duty with three in each shift.

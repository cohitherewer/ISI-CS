The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Opposition turns Saeed heat on PM
                                                                                                               Opposition turns Saeed heat on PM
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Hafiz Saeed                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 4: The Opposition today united to demand the Prime Ministers response on Mumbai attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed, needling the government on Manmohan Singhs trust but verify Pakistan strategy.         
	The Samajwadi Party, the RJD and the NDA demanded clarity on the governments policy towards Pakistan, citing a newspaper interview that suggested differences between the Prime Minister and foreign minister S.M. Krishna.         
	The Prime Minister has repeatedly said the progress of Indo-Pak relations depend on the neighbours ability to demonstrate that it is acting against terror groups using its soil to attack India.         
	But Singh has also told Parliament he has agreed to talks between the foreign secretaries of the two countries  in a joint statement after talks with Pakistan Prime Minster Yousaf Raza Gilani in Egypt last month. The joint statement delinked talks with action against terrorism.         
	Krishna is reported to have said that talks between the foreign secretaries would be futile unless Pakistan creates favourable conditions.        
	Saeeds release  despite repeated claims by India that it has provided evidence against the Jamaat-ud-Dawa leader  reveals Pakistans lack of determination to curb terror, Samajwadi chief Mulayam Singh Yadav argued.         
	The Prime Minister said we should trust but verify. Okay, so we trusted. Now, you have the verification of Pakistans intentions. The Prime Minister should clarify what the government plans to do now, Mulayam asked, during zero hour in the Lok Sabha.         
	The BJPs Yashwant Sinha referred to the Prime Ministers response to his query during the July 29 debate on the joint statement.         
	Sinha had then asked what had changed between his meeting with Asif Ali Zardari in Russia  where he ticked off the Pakistan President  and a week later with Prime Minister Gilani.         
	Singh had replied that Pakistan supplied a dossier in between the two meetings, indicating that it was taking action against those accused in last Novembers Mumbai attack.         
	Now that Pakistan has released Saeed, tagged the mastermind of the Mumbai attack by the government itself, what does the Prime Minister have to say? asked Sinha.         
	After the House was adjourned for an hour following the Oppositions demand for a debate, leader of the Opposition L.K. Advani resumed a brief discussion allowed by Speaker Meira Kumar.         
	Advani, Janata Dal (United) leader Sharad Yadav and RJD chief Lalu Prasad demanded that the government clarify whether Krishnas comments represented the governments views on relations with Pakistan. They staged a walkout when the government refused to commit to a response.

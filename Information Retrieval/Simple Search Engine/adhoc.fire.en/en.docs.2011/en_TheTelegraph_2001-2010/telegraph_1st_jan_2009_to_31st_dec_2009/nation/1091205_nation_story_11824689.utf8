	New Delhi, Dec. 4: A CPM member today demanded that the Centre explain how a minister had stayed in a five-star hotel for six months and asked who would foot the bill of Rs 37 lakh.        
	Without naming Trinamul Congress minister of state Sultan Ahmed, CPM leader Basudev Acharya told the Lok Sabha: One MoS tourism had stayed in the luxury hotel even though the government had months back announced austerity measures.        
	I would like to know who will foot the bill. Is the tourism ministry going to do it?        
	Ahmed moved out of the hotel a few days ago after his party asked him to pay all the extra expenses.

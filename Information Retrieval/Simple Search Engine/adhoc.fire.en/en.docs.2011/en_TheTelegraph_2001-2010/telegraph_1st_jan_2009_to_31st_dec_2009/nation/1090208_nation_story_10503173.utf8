The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Poll in sight, Rajnath returns to Ram   Temple perks up workers
                                                                                                               Poll in sight, Rajnath returns to Ram     -  Temple perks up workers

	Nagpur, Feb. 7: The magic of Lord Ram today once again lifted the sagging spirits of the BJP.        
	Party president Rajnath Singh, struggling to connect with constituents and infuse life into the poll campaign, invoked the time-tested symbol to great effect as he opened a BJP meet here.        
	Koi mai ka lal hamein Ram ke prati aastha se nahi diga sakta (No one can compel us to weaken our dedication to Ram), he said at the two-day BJP national council meet.        
	He went on to renew the party pledge to build a grand temple in Ayodhya. We are waiting for the right opportunity. If we come to power, we will speed up the process. If the BJP gets majority on its own, we will make the temple by enacting a law in Parliament.        
	The announcement came as a breath of fresh air to the almost 6,000 participants, who erupted in thunderous applause and broke into chants of Jai Shri Ram. Enthused by the chanting, heard at a BJP meeting after a long time, Rajnath deviated from his script and spoke extempore.        
	Starting with how the very mention of Ram had created heartburn among rivals, Rajnath went on to talk of the Ram setu, the allegedly anti-Hindu mindset of the UPA and the Congresss propensity to demolish Indias cultural symbols.        
	By the time he finished, Rajnath had brought hardcore Hindutva back to centre-stage, a day after he had omitted mention of the issue in his national executive address.        
	Rajnath made it clear ideology would be an important tool in the BJPs electioneering. This was in line with the sentiment of many participants who felt the party was making a big mistake by ignoring ideological issues.        
	A Madhya Pradesh leader summed up the mood among the workers: We havent come here to listen to foreign policy intricacies and details of the economic slowdown. We want instruction on how to mobilise cadres to win elections.        
	The disconnect between the BJP leadership and the workers was evident in many suggestions at the meet, one of which was that the leader of the hour was Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi.        
	Many said the BJPs Prime Minister candidate lacked the charisma to unsettle the UPA and, under his leadership, it would be difficult for the NDA to cross a tally of 200.        
	One reason they gave for Advanis apparent decline was his ideological confusion. Advaniji has been wrongly advised that lectures on good governance and use of Internet will win us the election, a senior leader said.        
	We won in Gujarat not because of good governance but because what Modi symbolises in totality. We won Madhya Pradesh because of the hard work by the Sangh parivar and the chief ministers. We dont have similar reasons on the national scale; so we must exploit our ideological appeal to the hilt.        
	Some leaders informally expressed indignation at party spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasads argument that the Ram temple could not be made an issue in every election.        
	Rajnaths declaration and the response it evoked have, however, shown that the BJP cannot afford to abandon its pet issues. The party boss talked about terror, agriculture, inflation, youth and other things but gave pride of place to the Ram temple.        
	Some saw this as the BJPs ploy of speaking differently on different occasions. At the select audience that attended the national executive, Rajnath avoided dwelling on Hindutva. But he changed his tune at the wider gathering of workers today.

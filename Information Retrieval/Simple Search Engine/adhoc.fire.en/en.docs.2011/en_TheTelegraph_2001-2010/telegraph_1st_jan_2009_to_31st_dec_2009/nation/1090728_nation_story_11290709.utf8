          G.S. MUDUR                           CNR Rao                                  
	New Delhi, July 27: Scientists in Bangalore have harnessed tiny grains of diamond and another form of carbon to dramatically increase the mechanical strength of a polymer, demonstrating a chemical phenomenon not observed before.         
	A team led by Indias leading materials scientist Chintamani Nagesa Ramacha- ndra Rao has increased the hardness of a polymer called polyvinyl alcohol fivefold by adding minuscule portions of two carbon materials.         
	The researchers at the Indian Institute of Science and the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research used two types of nanocarbons  materials so tiny that their sizes are measures in billionths of a metre  to create the hardest known polymer nanocomposite. They have described their work today in the US journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.         
	Their experiments suggest a new method to develop materials with extraordinary mechanical properties. Scientists predict such materials could become ubiquitous with application areas ranging from automobiles to aircraft to tennis rackets.         
	Scientists have known for decades that adding elements can significantly alter the properties of certain materials. This effect has been used routinely in commercial electronics and materials engineering.         
	Several studies over the past five years have shown that nanocarbon can increase mechanical strength of polymers. But the Bangalore experiments show that adding two types of nanocarbons has an unexpected and dramatic effect.         
	There is a synergy between the two types of nanocarbons  it is like adding one and one and getting not two, but getting 11, Rao, national professor at the JNCASR, told The Telegraph over the phone.         
	Researchers Urmimala Maitra and Barun Das at the JNCASR created the superhard polymer by adding nanodiamond and another nanocarbon material with a different molecular architecture into the raw material for the polymer.         
	At the IISc, doctoral student K. Eswar Prasad showed that less than 1 per cent of the two types of nanocarbons can increase hardness and stiffness by as much as 400 per cent.         
	The polymer strength goes up with very little amounts of the nanocarbon, said Upadrasta Ramamurty, associate professor at the IISc, and a team member. This could make such polymers easy to process for different applications.         
	But scientists caution that polyvinyl alcohol was used only as a test material. This material is not used in engineering components. For real world applications, we would have to get similar results on engineering polymers, Ramamurty said. The laboratory results would also have to be scaled up. The polymer tested was the size of a saucer and just a millimetre thick.         
	This is a new idea that opens a door for exploration, said Palle Rama Rao, a materials scientist and former director of the Defence Materials Research Laboratory in Hyderabad, who was not associated with the research.         
	The Bangalore study did not examine toughness and ductility  two other important mechanical properties of engineering materials. And the mechanism through which the nanocarbon pairs act on the polymer is still unclear.

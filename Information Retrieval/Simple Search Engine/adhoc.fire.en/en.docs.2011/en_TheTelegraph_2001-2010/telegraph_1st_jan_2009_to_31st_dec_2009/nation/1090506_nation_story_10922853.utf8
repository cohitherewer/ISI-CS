The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Script dated, Farooq unfazed
                                                                                                               Script dated, Farooq unfazed
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                          Farooq Abdullah campaigns in Srinagar                                   
	Srinagar, May 5: He wants a stethoscope to listen to how his rival, a big liar, faces God when the time comes.        
	He also wants a heat wave to scorch the rest of the country so that tourists flock to Kashmir.        
	And he prays for hell fire to burn all corrupt bureaucrats.        
	Farooq Abdullah hasnt changed one bit.        
	Twenty-seven years after he plunged full time into politics, the National Conference leader spoke in the same vein as he did when he would pepper his speech with jokes and pray for the wrath of God on his rivals.        
	His audience loved it. They called him godly, down to earth, clean-hearted.        
	But times have changed and nobody, it seems, takes him seriously these days. So if thousands of Kashmiris rallied behind him in 1984, when Farooq was toppled, his audience has now thinned to a trickle.        
	Yet Farooq, seemingly unaffected, was at his rhetorical best yesterday in Khanyar, Srinagar, where he is pitted against the Peoples Democratic Partys Molvi Iftikhar Ansari.        
	The 72-year-old called his rival Mufti Mohammad Sayeed a big liar, said he wanted to use a stethoscope to listen to how the PDP patron would face God in his grave, and dismissed Muftis deputy Tariq Hameed Qarra as a big thief.         
	He prayed for a heat wave in the rest of India and hell fire to scorch corrupt civil servants.        
	And, as always, he signed off with a prayer.        
	On Sunday, Farooq had a bitter verbal duel with Muzaffar Shah, his nephew who belongs to a rival party, during a live radio programme.        
	I will teach you a lesson in the elections, he told Shah, whose mother Khalida, Farooqs sister, is contesting against him in Srinagar on May 7.         
	In Srinagar yesterday, Farooq was aware that he was speaking in a locality that was a separatist nerve centre. He reminded Delhi that Article 370 was its only link with Srinagar. If there is no Article 370, we will cease to be a part of India. Neither my party nor my state will remain with India, he said.        
	That was not his language when he ruled Kashmir.        
	Yet, despite shifts in stand and his outdated script, Farooqs record is impressive. He has won every election he has contested in the past.        
	Moreover, Srinagar is the pocket borough of the National Conference, which won 12 out of 15 Assembly segments in the constituency in the recent state elections.        
	It has also helped that a large majority of voters in Srinagar, a separatist stronghold, has boycotted every election after 1989.        
	So long as people boycott elections, Farooq will have an edge because the National Conferences small band of dedicated voters will troop to booths on polling day.              
	 Srinagar votes on May 7

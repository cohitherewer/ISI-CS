	Houston, July 18 (PTI): An Indian-American doctor couple has been charged with illegally distributing 1.3 million tablets of a controlled drug and defrauding several health insurance companies of $31 million.        
	The couple have filed false claims through their clinics dubbed as pill mills.        
	Arun Sharma and his wife Kiran, both 54, have been charged with conspiracy to unlawfully dispense and distribute controlled substances outside the scope of professional practice and not for a legitimate medical purpose, the FBI said in a statement.

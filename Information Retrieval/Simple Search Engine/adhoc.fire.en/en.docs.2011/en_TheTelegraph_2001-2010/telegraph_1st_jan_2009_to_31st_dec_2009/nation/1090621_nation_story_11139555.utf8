The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Being ragged? Get help in 15 minutes
                                                                                                               Being ragged? Get help in 15 minutes
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                          Kapil Sibal: Ragging rescue                                  
	New Delhi, June 20: India today launched a national, toll-free helpline for victims of ragging, assuring them assistance at all hours within 15 minutes of a distress call in a move described by education minister Kapil Sibal as historic.        
	Students entering Indias higher education system, scarred by deaths and grievous injuries from violent ragging, will no longer have to fear indignity, Sibal said, launching the helpline.        
	I am surrounded by journalists and am in danger of being ragged, he joked, speaking to the helpline call centre attendant during the launch call at the human resource development ministry.        
	I was ragged when I was in college, and I admit I too ragged my juniors, but it was never severe. The problem, however, is that it is hard to know the Lakshman rekha of what is acceptable to a particular fresher, Sibal said.        
	The number 5522 has been chosen for the helpline, which will need to be dialled as 1800-180-5522 to use the toll-free mode. Students can also email complaints to helplineantiragging.net.        
	A five-digit, toll-free number, 55222, is also being worked on but it will take a little time, ministry joint secretary Sunil Kumar said.        
	BSNL is the telecommunication provider for the service and the helpline will be handled at all hours from a call centre in west Delhis Kirti Nagar.        
	This is a historic moment. It is the strongest measure yet that we have taken against ragging, which is a national menace, Sibal said.        
	The helpline will be guided by the University Grant Commissions new regulations against ragging that have now come into effect.        
	A student will receive a unique identification number on calling the helpline, which will be used in all subsequent official work on the case to guard his or her identity.        
	The distress call will be forwarded to the head of the callers institution and the warden of his hostel as well as district authorities and, if necessary, police.        
	The institution is to alert an anti-ragging squad that must compulsorily be set up under the new regulations. This squad is required to rush to the spot where the student has alleged ragging within 15 minutes of the original distress call.        
	A database at the central call centre will store the status of each case. The status of cases will also be available on a website to allow ordinary citizens to track whether the institutions involved and the authorities are taking adequate action.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | A House dream rides on 3 wheels
                                                                                                               A House dream rides on 3 wheels
  - woman auto driver in poll battle          CITHARA PAUL IN NEW DELHI                          Auto driver Sunitha Chowdhury campaigns in Delhi. Picture by Rajesh Kumar                                        
	Delhis lone woman auto-rickshaw driver dreams of breaking another barrier. Sunitha Chowdhury, 33, wants to become an MP.        
	Sunitha, a candidate from the New Delhi Lok Sabha constituency, has been fielded by the United Womens Front, billed as Indias first national political party formed entirely by women.        
	Anybody who has travelled in my auto will vote for me, said the illiterate woman who has been plying her auto for the past five years.        
	She believes her record of social service will be a help: for years now, she has been picking up accident victims from Delhis roads whenever she sees one and rushing them to hospital. I beat up other auto drivers when they refuse to carry the victims, Sunitha, who is of medium height and average build, smiled.        
	Sunithas first step in electoral politics came during last Novembers Delhi Assembly polls, when she contested the Mehrauli seat and lost her deposit. She had been fielded by the Panthers Party, which had nominated many ordinary people while contesting 11 seats.        
	Up against senior politicians like Ajay Maken of the Congress and Vijay Goel of the BJP, Sunitha knows her chances arent too bright this time either. Anyway, Ive been plying my auto on the citys notoriously unsafe roads. If that has not hassled me, neither will this election.        
	Few things have been able to stand in Sunithas way  not going to school, being married off at 13, dowry torture, losing her child at 14.        
	The Meerut-born girl had run away from her in-laws home for fear of getting murdered. She was pregnant and 14. She took a train to Delhi though she knew no one in the city and had no money. She lived in an orphanage for a few months, then moved to a health centre in Mehrauli, where her child was born and died two months later.        
	Sunitha stayed on at the centre for nine years. Its during her stint here that she began picking up the injured from the streets and taking them to hospital. It was the plight of these helpless people that gave me the idea of having my own auto.        
	Transport officials tried to fob her off saying women were not eligible. They relented after she chased them for two years. Commuters were reluctant to travel in my auto in the initial days, she said, but now everything is okay.        
	One day a few months ago, she was contacted by social activist Suman Krishan Kant, wife of late Vice-President Krishan Kant. Suman Kant, who had launched the United Womens Front in 2007, wanted her to be one of the partys two candidates this election.        
	One of the partys key demands is 50 per cent reservation for women in Parliament and state Assemblies.        
	Its something that could really put Indias women in the driving seat, says Sunitha.

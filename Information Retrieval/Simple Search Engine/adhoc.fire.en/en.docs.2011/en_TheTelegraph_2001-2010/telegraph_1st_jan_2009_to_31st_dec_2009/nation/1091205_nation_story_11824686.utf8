The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Experts question emission cut
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Experts question emission cut
  - BJP says move will weaken Indias position in negotiations        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       Ramesh                                
	New Delhi, Dec. 4: Indias announcement of the proposed reduction in the intensity of carbon emissions has evoked ripples of concern about its impact on the upcoming global climate change talks and its implications on the countrys energy growth.         
	Environment and forests minister Jairam Ramesh had told Parliament yesterday that India would seek to reduce its carbon emissions intensity by 20 to 25 per cent by 2020 from the levels in 2005.         
	Energy and environmental experts and the BJP warned today that this proclamation could weaken Indias negotiating position at the UN climate change conference opening in Copenhagen next week.         
	The conference is expected to finalise multiple strategies  including legally binding emission reduction targets for industrialised countries  to reduce global emissions of greenhouse gases.         
	We agree India should work to make its economy less carbon intensive, but were worried Indias domestic target may be misused by the industrialised countries to dismantle the global climate agreement, said Sunita Narain, director of the Centre for Science and Environment.         
	These (industrialised) countries would like the goalpost of the international climate agreement changed  from rich countries taking legally binding commitments to all (countries) taking voluntary domestic commitments, Narain said.         
	The US and Australia have proposed a new agreement that will be based on each countrys domestic pledge. Indias announcement in Parliament tantamounts to such a pledge. In recent weeks, Brazil, China and Indonesia have made similar emissions intensity reduction statements.         
	In climate change talks, India has insisted it wants industrialised countries to take on legally binding emissions reductions targets. But the CSE fears that the industrialised countries may cite Indias domestic pledge on emissions to Indian negotiators and seek to treat them in the same way as international commitments.         
	Rameshs articulation of Indias future emissions intensity reductions also drew criticism from the BJP.         
	Party leader Arun Jaitley, who is also the leader of Opposition, said it was bad strategy to announce a unilateral position without waiting for the approach of developed countries. It is Indias experience in various international negotiations that unilateral concessions announced before multilateral dialogue become the starting point in Indias negotiations, Jaitley said.        
	The announcement by Ramesh has weakened Indias negotiating position.         
	A leading energy expert also cautioned that it was unclear how India could achieve the proposed 20 to 25 per cent cut in carbon emissions intensity and yet meet the needs of the countrys vast energy-deprived population.         
	We still have nearly 60 per cent of Indias population living without adequate electricity, said Surya Sethi, former principal adviser on power and energy in the planning commission, Indias top government think tank, said: I would like to see a detailed roadmap that shows how India can achieve the proposed 20 or 25 per cent intensity reduction while meeting the future energy requirements of the two-thirds (population) who do not have access to energy today.

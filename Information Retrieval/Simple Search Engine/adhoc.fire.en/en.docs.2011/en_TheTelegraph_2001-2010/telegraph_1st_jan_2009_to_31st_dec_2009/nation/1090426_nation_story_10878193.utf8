The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | INVISIBLE HANDS
                                                                                                               INVISIBLE HANDS
  They write the subplots of these elections from their lairs in Delhi. Sanjay K. Jha and Rasheed Kidwai lift the veil on the backroom brigade                                             
	You will not see them jump off helicopters to wave at crowds, or unleash lungpower from daises, soaked in adulation.        
	They are huddled in offices over cups of coffee, gazing at computer screens or piles of paper, working unseen and unheard.        
	Yet every time a star campaigner grabs centre-stage, you can be sure these backroom boys and girls have written the script, done the prompting and conjured every prop.        
	Rival teams of strategists, spin doctors and crisis managers are working long hours in the Congress and BJP election war rooms, inventing tactics, formulating responses and coining slogans. And, of course, trying to out-think each other.        
	Confidentiality and teamwork are the key virtues  so much so that, sources said, even senior Congress minister Arjun Singh, a disgruntled man these days, couldnt get in despite requesting a role.        
	The war rooms are headed by the most trusted men  Sonia Gandhis political secretary Ahmed Patel and L.K. Advanis aide Sudheendra Kulkarni. With them work party officials from various rungs and professionals from outside.        
	The BJP also has 43 apolitical volunteers engaged in tasks ranging from research to managing Advanis portal. These young men - and a few women  have taken a two-month break from their regular jobs.        
	Mallika Noora is with an IT firm in the US; Debo is a banker in New Zealand and Harsh an IIM graduate from Ahmedabad. Each puts in a non-stop 13 hours every day at 26 Tughlaq Crescent.        
	Congress leaders hold daily meetings at their 15 Rakabganj Road centre at 11am and 6pm. In between, a dozen professionals from ad agencies slip in and out. Rahul Gandhi takes regular briefings if he is in Delhi.              
	Trips and traps        
	The teams take care of humdrum affairs  like campaign logistics  and tricky ones, like laying traps.        
	This is what the BJP claims to have done with the weak PM strategy. As Tughlaq Crescent watched Manmohan hit back at Advani on TV, Jaitley began chuckling. He has fallen into our trap. Lets now carry on with this weak-versus-strong debate, he said.        
	Other members, initially taken aback by Manmohans barbs, agreed and one of them asked for mithai. A packet of sweets was quickly brought to the war room.        
	Congress spin doctors laugh at this talk of traps. They proudly describe how they have avoided false steps.        
	When Lalu Prasad tarred the Congress with Babri, the core groups response, right from the start, was to let it pass (other than getting the Prime Minister to make a factual statement on the Centres role during the demolition).        
	A member cited how the railway minister has been repeating he is still part of the UPA. That is enough for us.        
	A fortnight ago, Ahmed Patel and his team decided to go soft on the Left. Individual candidates in Bengal, Kerala and Tripura, of course, have a free hand to attack the communists in their own campaigns.        
	The thrill of the chase, however, is often based on the drudgery of painstaking analysis. Among the experts in the BJP war room are the psephologist G.V.L. Narasimha Rao whose company, Development and Research Services, has hired around 300 people to work in important constituencies and send inputs.        
	The BJP core group meets everyday to analyse the research teams inputs, assess the media campaigns impact and choose issues for the next round. It monitors every statement by leaders of other parties.              
	Trouble-shooting        
	Open eyes and ears are crucial to crisis management, one area that keeps the teams on their toes.        
	We stay glued to whatever is happening across the country. The Tytler episode has shown that our politics is like a Chinese battery; you never know when something will explode, said a strategist who has a backup team providing 24x7 monitoring and feedback.        
	When reporter Jarnail Singh aimed his shoe at P. Chidambaram, the centre was clear from the start that there is no need to be defensive.        
	The question is not whether the Congress is good or bad. The question is, which party has tried to reach out to sensitivities that go beyond the law, a member said at the first meeting after the incident.        
	Others cited how the BJP had brazened it out on controversial leaders like Varun Gandhi and Maya Kodnani, who had taken a month to quit as Gujarat minister after the state government accepted her involvement in riots.        
	When Jagdish Tytler and Sajjan Kumars tickets were withdrawn, we walked with our heads high, a source said.              
	Jobs at hand        
	Tughlaq Crescent is focusing on projecting Advanis leadership skills while not losing sight of the price rise, slowdown and farmer distress. A tricky problem is how to wriggle out of the Kandahar mess.        
	Rakabganj Roads prime task is to market the Manmohan-Sonia combo in addition to subtly building up Brand Rahul  a whole ball game different from the competitors job of projecting one man. Striking the right balance between the Prime Ministers authority, the Congress presidents supremacy and Rahuls ascendance is tough, but the Congress managers have so far done it without hiccups.        
	The rivalry between the two teams is intense and each claims to have stolen a march over the other.        
	Look at the way radio is working to our advantage, a Congress leader said. Its more inclusive than TV and a better way of reaching the aam admi.        
	Another Congress strategist claimed that FM radio was the best way to deal with local issues.        
	The idea apparently came from general secretary Digvijay Singh and minister Anand Sharma. According to Digvijay and Jairam Ramesh, 70 per cent of party ads are going to the regional media.        
	The BJP too has prepared its short films in most of the regional languages, but it is focusing on the national media in the belief that a swing in the national mood alone can bring in overall change.        
	The Congress boys and girls giggle at the BJPs high-pitched campaign, saying 2004 has shown that high-voltage campaigns  like the BJPs India Shining ad  do not necessarily work.        
	As for the Bhay Ho reply to Jai Ho, Atul Hedge of Ignitee Digital Solutions said at Rakabganj Road: Within two days of the Jai Ho launch, the film received over 30,000 views and has now become the most discussed video on Internet social sites.        
	Spin doctors should be adept at brinkmanship. May 16 will bring their report cards, too.                    WITH INPUTS FROM RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

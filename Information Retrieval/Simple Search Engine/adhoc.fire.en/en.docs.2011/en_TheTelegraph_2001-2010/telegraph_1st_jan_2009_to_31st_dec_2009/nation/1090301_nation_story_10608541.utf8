The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mutiny glare on troop recruitment by ideology 
                                                                                                               Mutiny glare on troop recruitment by ideology 
                                        
	As facts and information have emerged over the past days, disbelief has turned to horror at the happenings at Pilkhana, the headquarters of Bangladesh Rifles (BDR), located in the heart of Dhaka. What may have appeared early on Wednesday as something more than a fracas arising from pent-up resentment is now known to be the cold-blooded and brutal murder of scores of army officers and, in some cases, of their families. The search for bodies still continues.         
	The complaints of the BDR with regard to poor service conditions and discrimination vis-a-vis the army are long-standing. Their grievances acquire an obvious edge as they are officered entirely by the army officers on deputation who, they may have felt, have not adequately projected their demands to the administration.         
	Bangladesh Rifles has historical links to British days and is also proud of being the successor to East Pakistan Rifles, the first organised group to resist, at great cost, the rampaging Pakistani forces in 1971. Such sympathy as may have existed for its legitimate demands in the early hours would have since dissipated in the shock and revulsion at the indelible stain of February 2009 on its escutcheon.         
	Quite obviously, the intelligence agencies of Bangladesh, notably the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence, believed to possess great resources in information and influence, would have to do serious introspection with regard to their functioning. It would not be credible to any that the killings of February 25 had no prior planning. Some amends could be made if those who manipulated the perpetrators of the crimes are identified and brought to book.         
	Most regrettably, from 1971 onwards, too often has immunity been provided either by decisions of the state or by its inaction, making for a culture of engaging with impunity in crimes with political intent.         
	The government of Bangladesh has acted with speed and wisdom. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has spoken with understanding and yet with great firmness to bring the episode to an end. Her ministers and others personally visited the centre of the mutiny to negotiate a surrender. Their courage and commitment has been exemplary and leadership has been on display.         
	The view of a leader of the Opposition that the mutiny should have been quelled by arms and not with the offer of a general amnesty begs the question, for this would in all likelihood have meant the death of those who had been spared the initial assault, besides starting a fratricidal conflict.         
	Some army officers, since released from Pilkhana, have said that they were protected by BDR jawans, acting against the orders of the ring-leaders. It is possible that the Prime Ministers address to the nation may have isolated the core group of mutineers and persuaded many to lay down arms.         
	It is also worth noting that the BDR is a significant force of 67,000 men (as against 250,000 in the army) and it would have been a serious error to treat them all alike for the actions of some. The Chief of Army Staff has spoken of the need to maintain calm and work for the restoration of peace and confidence.         
	Understandably, there would be demands for revenge and retribution. The episode would surely leave scars. But to ensure that these do not become running sores in the armed forces or the body politic the guilty have to be brought speedily to book.         
	To avoid any misunderstanding, it has already been clarified that the offered amnesty does not include those personally guilty of heinous crimes. No less important would be the transparency with which this is done. Many in Bangladesh have already suggested that it would be useful, if possible, to associate the Opposition in the task of restoring confidence.         
	The challenge to a government within weeks of the massive peoples verdict raises many an obvious question. It is no secret that over the years, the Bangladesh Army, and perhaps more the Bangladesh Rifles, has inducted as a matter of policy many with ideological affiliations. The leadership of these institutions and the political leadership would have to take a view on how healthy this may be for the nation as a whole. A state of continuing instability and insecurity, preventing the government from many steps it is committed to, could well have been an objective of the instigators.         
	The last few days have been traumatic for the people of Bangladesh. Besides the loss of many young lives, there is also a serious blow to self-esteem. Even as this remains entirely an internal matter for the administration of Bangladesh to resolve, as close neighbours we must empathise with their anguish.

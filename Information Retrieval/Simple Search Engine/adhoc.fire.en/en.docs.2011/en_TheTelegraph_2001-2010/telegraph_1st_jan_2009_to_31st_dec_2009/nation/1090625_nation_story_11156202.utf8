          OUR CORRESPONDENT      
	Lalgarh, June 24: The Bengal government has transferred officers-in-charge of four police stations, including Lalgarh, to strengthen the network for collecting information on Maoist guerrillas camping in the battle zone.        
	The officers will be replaced with those who have experience in working in Maoist strongholds, sources said.        
	The transfers are part of our strategy to combat attacks from the outlawed CPI (Maoist). We need officers who have some idea about the style of the outfits guerrilla attacks, said a senior West Midnapore police officer.        
	According to the sources, the officers-in-charge of Lalgarh, Jamboni, Binpur and Jhargram police stations have been handed transfer notices and will be replaced soon.         
	We have no idea what is happening in the core area, a 12km stretch from Lalgarh to Ramgarh. We have to feed the central force by supplying intelligence. Our intelligence network collapsed since the Lalgarh stalemate blocked police access to the area, an official said.        
	To collect information, we have to depend on local people and take them into confidence. The officers in these police stations did not get any chance to interact with the people because of the police boycott programme called by the Maoists under the banner of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities.        
	The official cited the example of Gour Kanjilal who joined as OC of Lalgarh police station a month ago. Collecting information was next to impossible for him. He did not get a chance to go to Ramgarh. He does not know the topography of the core area. He does not know the location of Barapelia, where the committees office is situated, or where Ramgarh police outpost is.        
	The officers posted in other police stations also did not get a chance to tour their area properly because of the boycott programme. We will replace them with officers who worked in these police stations in the past. It will help us get a basic picture of the area, said another official.

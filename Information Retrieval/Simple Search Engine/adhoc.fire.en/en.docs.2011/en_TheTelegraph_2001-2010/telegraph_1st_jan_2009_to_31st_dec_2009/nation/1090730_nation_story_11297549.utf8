          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, July 29: JD(U) supporters today took out a procession of donkeys to counter the Ram Vilas Paswan-sponsored tirade against chief minister Nitish Kumar for allegedly jeopardising the Dalit interest in the state, even as Nitish reeled off the measures taken by his government for Dalit uplift in the Assembly.        
	The chief minister mentioned Mukhyamantri Poshak Yojna, land for Mahadalits, community halls and schools for children as just few of the several measures taken by the government to bring the most deprived section into the mainstream.        
	Nitish Kumar, while speaking in the Assembly, said that his government had identified 1,06,000 Mahadalit families eligible for three decimals of land each. In cases where the government failed to provide them land, the state has decided to pay cash to allow them to buy land and build their homes.         
	He said that the government had also chalked out plans to link Mahadalit settlements with roads, while efforts are on to rope in artists from the community to plan informative folk community radio programmes.         
	The NDA has chalked out an action plan under Bihar Mahadalit Vikash Mission for over five million people identified as Mahadalits in Bihar, said Nitish said, making a suo motu statement in both houses of the Bihar legislature.         
	The government has constituted a Mahadalit Commission through personnel and administrative reforms department resolution taken in August 2007 for all-round development of the group. The commission has identified 20 out of 22 Scheduled Castes as Mahadalits.         
	LJP boss Ram Vilas Paswan has been agitating for three days protesting against what the party has described as anti-Dalit policies of Nitish Kumar. A Dalit leader, Paswan has said that the word Mahadalit has no constitutional sanction and that the Bihar chief minister coined the word to divide Dalits and rule.

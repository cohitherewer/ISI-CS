The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | 26/11 cops in a jam get court lesson on guns 
                                                                                                               26/11 cops in a jam get court lesson on guns 
          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                          Kasab                                  
	Mumbai, June 14: The special court hearing the 26/11 cases has lectured the citys police force on how to maintain their 50-year-old weapons, irked by the repeated refrain of policemen who battled the terrorists that they could not open fire since their guns got jammed.        
	Constable Manmath Nardele of the Government Railway Police, who deposed last week on the attack inside the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, said he fired eight rounds from his .303 rifle at the terrorists  he identified Ajmal Kasab seated in the dock and Ismail Khan from a photograph  after which his weapon got locked.         
	Hearing the same thing two days in a row, special judge M.L. Tahaliyani retorted: Why do you people have 50-year-old weapons which jam when they need to work?        
	Tahaliyani then offered a piece of stinging advice. You people sit at the station doing nothing. Why dont you use that time to clean the rifle so that it works properly? he told the hapless constable.         
	Earlier last week, Railway Protection Force head constable Jullu Yadav, who has received a cash reward of Rs 10 lakh for showing courage on 26/11, had said he had tried battling the Pakistani gunmen with a self-loading rifle, but it was jammed.         
	Referring to Yadavs testimony, Tahaliyani said: Yesterday also one policeman said he couldnt fire because his gun was locked. If there would have been four policemen (at the spot), I am sure all their guns would have been locked.         
	The judge delved into the reasons for the malfunctioning weapon. There can be one or more reasons why rifles get locked. One is that the weapon is hot. Second is the spring (of the rifle) is damaged. But I am sure the constables dont even know how to unlock the weapons, he said.         
	Tahaliyani then began testing Nardeles knowledge. Did he know how to unlock the weapon? No, said the constable. Well, did Nardele know how much a .303 rifle weighed? Sir, it weighs around 1.5 kg, replied the constable.         
	Of course not, shot back the judge. I am sure it weighs around 4 to 5 kg, and you have to keep it on your shoulder to fire it, and there is a high jolt when it is fired.        
	Police officers refused to accept anything was wrong with the rifles. Government Railway Police commissioner A.K. Sharma said: There was no mechanical defect in the .303 rifles. Maintenance of the weapon is mandatory, but the onus is on the men who use the weapon. Perhaps, they (the policemen) did not use the rifles properly. And the word is not locked. It is cocked.         
	He said .303 rifles could get cocked if the trigger and bolt are not pressed fully. It is possible that they didnt pull the trigger properly in panic. But, you cant fault the rifles which weigh around 3kg, said Sharma.         
	Anti-terror expert Colonel M.P. Chaudhary, who trained the first motorcycle-borne commandos of the Mumbai police, said .303 rifles continued be regarded as the most reliable weapons, but lack of training in handling them could have caused problems.         
	It is a single-shot weapon with a 10-round magazine. If two rounds are fired in quick succession, spring action could lead to the locking. It can be quickly unlocked by pulling the bolt out. But if the cartridge expands within the chamber while firing, it cannot be unlocked unless taken to a workshop, said Chaudhary, adding that expired bullets could also cause the weapon to misfire.

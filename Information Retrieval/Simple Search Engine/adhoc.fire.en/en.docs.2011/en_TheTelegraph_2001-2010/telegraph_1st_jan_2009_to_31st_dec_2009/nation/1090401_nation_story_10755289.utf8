The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Five-in-one pill cuts heart attack risk
                                                                                                               Five-in-one pill cuts heart attack risk
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                           
	New Delhi, March 31: A cocktail of five drugs, locked in a single pill, reduces the risk of heart disease and stroke in otherwise healthy people who have high blood pressure or abnormal cholesterol, an Indian study has suggested.         
	The effects of the polypill  containing aspirin, three blood pressure lowering drugs, and a cholesterol-lowering agent  could potentially halve the risk of heart attacks or strokes in such people, according to its findings released on Monday.         
	Doctors from St Johns Medical College, Bangalore, and other institutions working with collaborators in Canada, have found that a single polypill a day lowers blood pressure and cholesterol and delivers the anti-clotting effect of aspirin, too.         
	The observed reductions in blood pressure and cholesterol could lead to about 24 per cent reduction in heart disease and 33 per cent reduction in strokes in people who have average blood pressure levels, the doctors have calculated.        
	The study, presented at a meeting of the American College of Cardiology in Florida, involved more than 2,000 people aged between 45 and 80 years from 50 clinics across India.         
	The study has also helped establish that the polypill is tolerable  there is no evidence that combining five drugs into a single pill increases intolerability.         
	The product used in the study was manufactured by Indian drug maker Cadila Pharma.         
	The results, to be published in the journal Lancet, showed the cholesterol-lowering effect and the anti-clotting effect are slightly less than these effects with an individual cholesterol-lowering statin or with aspirin alone. The formulation used in this study can be conveniently used to reduce multiple risk factors and cardiovascular risk, a researcher said.         
	The people recruited for the study were healthy but had at least one of the five possible risk factors for heart disease or stroke  obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels, or smokers for at least the past five years.         
	But cardiovascular experts caution that the idea of a polypill being prescribed to individuals with a single risk factor is unlikely to gain wide acceptance.         
	The number of people with single risk factors will touch millions, said Prashant Joshi, a doctor at the Government Medical College, Nagpur, who was a member of an expert committee that developed the protocol for the polypill trial.         
	You cant expect millions of people with no symptoms at all to go on a pill, said Joshi. A much better option would be for such people to adopt diet and lifestyle changes to reduce blood pressure and cholesterol, he told The Telegraph.         
	Doctors believe the polypill is primarily likely to be prescribed to patients who have already experienced symptoms of coronary artery disease or people who have two or more risk factors for cardiovascular disease.         
	The polypill may help address gaps that appear in the treatment of patients, said a senior cardiologist in New Delhi. Studies have indicated that after one year of drug therapy, some proportion of patients with heart disease who have no symptoms tend to drop part of their medications. A polypill is expected to improve compliance.         
	But doctors also point out that the study has only established the effect of the polypill on blood pressure and cholesterol and calculated theoretical outcomes on heart attacks and strokes  based on earlier studies.         
	We still need to see evidence that the polypills effect of lowering blood pressure or cholesterol also translates into reduction in heart disease and stroke, said Dorairajan Prabhakaran, a cardiologist at the Centre for Chronic Disease Control.         
	Two years ago, Dr Reddys Laboratories had initiated clinical trials with a four-in-one pill against cardiovascular diseases that is now under evaluation.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 20: The health ministry indicated today it wanted to add traditional ayurvedic prescriptions to its arsenal against the pandemic flu virus which has so far infected 2,401 people in India.        
	Traditional ayurveda and unani interventions can be used to increase immunity to fight flu-like conditions, the ministry said after consulting experts from private and public institutions and research councils of traditional medicines.         
	The ministry said traditional medicine interventions may be used by healthy persons and patients with mild symptoms such as cold and cough.         
	But patients with severe symptoms, as well as persons at high risk of developing complications, should approach government screening centres for standard management with antiviral oseltamivir and other supportive therapy.         
	Among the prescriptions the ministry has listed are consumption of decoctions of tulsi, turmeric and pepper each morning, avoiding cold drinks, fermented food and ice creams, and drinking hot water instead of cold water.        
	The ministry has also cited a number of ayurvedic and unani preparations that traditional medicine experts believe increase the bodys immunity.         
	A PTI report tonight put the number of deaths at 44.         
	A senior doctor at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences said the ministry should initiate research on the impact of traditional interventions on flu-like illnesses.         
	The ministry has also asked hospitals screening patients with flu symptoms to apply triage, a battlefield and emergency practice aimed at allocating resources to patients who need it the most.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 30: Inordinate delay in publication of BPL list sparked uproar in the Assembly today with the Opposition demanding immediate publication of the revised list.        
	On the other hand, blaming the Centre for the delay in finalisation of BPL list, panchayati raj minister Prafulla Samal assured MLAs that the government would publish the BPL list within 60 days after the receipt of central guideline.        
	However, not satisfied with the ministers assurance, Opposition Congress members staged an angry walkout. Earlier, moving an adjournment notice, Opposition chief whip Prasad Harichandan lambasted the government for the inordinate delay in finalisation of the BPL list and dubbed the government the enemy of the poor.        
	He said that the list of families living below poverty line identified in 1997 was still in force. The state government was yet to finalise the BPL list prepared in 2002, as a result of which lakhs of poor families were being deprived of benefits like subsidised rice, free treatment, Indira Awas Yojana homes, old-age pension, etc.        
	Harichandan, a former minister, alleged that seven lakh old people were deprived of the Centres Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension Scheme, as the state government failed to finalise the BPL list. The government should give a definite deadline for publication of the BPL list, demanded the Opposition members.        
	Responding to the demand, Samal said the government was keen to publish the BPL list and had initiated the process for revision of the 2002 BPL list. However, the revision exercise was deferred since the Centres decision was awaited.        
	The state government had suggested to the Centre to include primitive tribes, landless people, HIV patients and other categories of rural poor in the final BPL list. Besides, Naveen had met the Union rural development minister on October 21 and discussed about the 2009 BPL list.

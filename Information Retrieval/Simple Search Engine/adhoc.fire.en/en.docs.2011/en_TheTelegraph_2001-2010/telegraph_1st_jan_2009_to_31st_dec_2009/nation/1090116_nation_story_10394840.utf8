          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 15: A woman, who protested against razing of her dwelling by corporation bulldozers by removing her blouse at the secretariat last evening, filed two FIRs today.        
	Janaki Majhi and her son were rendered homeless after Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation-owned bulldozers ran over their shanty at the Master Canteen area last evening.         
	Accompanied by Tapasi Praharaj, the state secretary of All-India Democratic Womens Association, and other activists, the 40-year-old woman filed two cases against BMC authorities.        
	The civic body, as part of its beautification drive, was on a forceful eviction move at different parts of the city. Yesterday, the officials landed up at the Master Canteen Square and targeted unauthorised set-ups there. There was no notice issued earlier. Despite my requests to allow us five minutes, the officials ordered the bulldozer to run over my house, said Janaki, who had been selling some plastic stuff and making a living for her and her epileptic son.        
	Janaki ran to the nearby secretariat to meet the chief minister. The chief ministers father Biju Patnak had given me Rs 1,800 to start this business. I wanted to ask his son when his father had helped me start a life, why was he ending it? said Janaki.        
	When the guards there tried to resist her entry, she removed her blouse as a mark of protest. Janaki was later carried in a police van to the Mahila police station from where she was released after a medical check-up.

	Mumbai, Aug. 13 (PTI): Actor Shiney Ahuja who is accused of raping his domestic help was today chargesheeted and his judicial remand extended till August 27.        
	The metropolitan court also transferred the case of the 36-year-old actor, now in Arthur Road prison in central Mumbai, to a sessions court.        
	Shiney (in picture) was arrested on June 15 and the sessions court had rejected his bail application after observing that prima facie there was evidence against him.        
	The Andheri metropolitan magistrate does not have the jurisdiction to conduct the trial as the offences under which the actor has been booked are punishable with more than three years imprisonment.         
	Earlier in the day, the police submitted a 109-page chargesheet against Shiney accusing him of threatening the girl, illegally confining her and raping her at his Oshiwara home in Andheri on June 14.

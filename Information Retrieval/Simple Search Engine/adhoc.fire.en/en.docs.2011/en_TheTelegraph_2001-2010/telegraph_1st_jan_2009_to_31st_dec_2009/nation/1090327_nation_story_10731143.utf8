	New Delhi, March 26: Two national-level athletes, one a former footballer and the other a wrestler, have been arrested here for alleged murder, kidnapping and carjacking.        
	Police said Agra-based Satguru Das Maheshwari, 45, and Haryana wrestler Krishan Kumar, 22, had been driven to crime by huge debts.        
	Maheshwari and two alleged accomplices were arrested today and charged with kidnapping and killing property dealer Dharmendra Arora. Maheshwari, who was elected chairman of the Swami Bagh panchayat in Agra in 1995, had planned to demand a Rs 1-crore ransom but murdered Arora when he resisted, the police said.        
	Kumar, a state-level gold medallist who has represented Haryana in the nationals, was arrested yesterday for alleged carjacking and car thefts across Delhi. He belonged to a gang of car thieves and was also involved in the abduction of a businessman from Dwarka, assistant commissioner (crime) Satyendra Garg said.        
	Police sources said many political parties hire local and state-level wrestlers from Delhi and its neighbourhood during election time to act as musclemen.        
	They are tasked with capturing booths, guarding candidates and intimidating or beating up opponents. While the party-backed immunity lasts, they also carry out other crimes for personal gain.        
	During the recent Delhi state polls, several wrestlers were involved in carjacking, murder and intimidation, the sources said. The police have asked akharas in the capital and its neighbourhood to keep an eye on their wrestlers till the general election ends.        
	Do you know how little we are paid at competitions? It doesnt even cover a days expense. We are not cricketers, a state-level wrestler said.        
	We dont have a paisa left when our bodies give out. Many promising wrestlers quit midway to become politicians strongmen because they cannot feed their families. Im not justifying their crimes, but did the government leave them with a choice?        
	In 2007, Narinder, 29, a state-level wrestler, was picked up on the charge of murdering a weightlifting champion, Naveen Kumar.        
	In March 2008, a national-level wrestler and trainer, Rajvir alias Miller, was arrested by the Delhi polices narcotics branch for alleged trafficking.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 3: Rihana would look into the mirror everyday and ask her mother to stitch her lips. Ammi, sow my lips nah, she would urge, says mother Shahida Begum.        
	Today, the eight-year-old loves to look at herself. My friends call me pretty and I can speak clearly, said Rihana, as she waited at Kalinga Hospital.        
	She is one of the 2,300 children who have received free cleft surgery at the hospital that has joined hands with Smile Train  an US-based organisation  to help thousands with the condition.        
	The hospital has opened a state-of-the-art centre with a unit with 20 beds with the help of a grant of Rs 1.5 crore from Smile Train.         
	The medical centre also provides cosmetic surgery, speech therapists and a brand new operation theatre.        
	With these, the hospital may become one of the best centres in India for cleft surgeries, said surgeon S. Baliarsingh.        
	A cleft lip is an opening in the upper lip between the mouth and nose, while a cleft palate is created when the roof of the mouth has a hole. Babies can be born with any one of the conditions or both.        
	The problem of a cleft lip or palate is often an economic one and not medical. Families sometimes are too poor to afford to pay for surgery and our aim is to help them, said the doctor.        
	The hospital already had the facility of cleft lip surgery since 2004 and doctors here have performed as many as 2,300 corrective surgeries so far.         
	However, the new set-up is expected to facilitate treatment further.

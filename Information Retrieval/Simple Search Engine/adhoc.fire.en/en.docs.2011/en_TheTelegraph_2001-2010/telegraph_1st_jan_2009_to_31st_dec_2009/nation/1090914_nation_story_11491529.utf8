The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CISF loses officers to promotion grouse 
                                                                                                               CISF loses officers to promotion grouse

	New Delhi, Sept. 13: Career stagnation has forced at least 20 middle-rung officers of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) to leave for greener pastures, revealing the spread of a problem cited by RAW officials while going on protest leave.        
	The CISF, which guards airports and other high-security installations, has lost the officers over the past two years. Three were holding the rank of deputy inspector-general. I felt cheated, said Vivek Tiwari, who joined a multinational company after 13 years in the CISF. I have not regretted it (quitting the CISF) for a minute, after having realised I would have had to spend my whole life banging my head against the system, he said.        
	In the CISF, there are more than 150 Group A officers who were recruited through the civil services examination. They were put in the CISF by the Department of Personnel and Training in the 1990s and are now middle-rung officers.        
	Some CISF officers of the 1991 batch of the civil services examination are still stuck in pay band III (commandant/deputy secretary rank) while their batchmates in other services like the Indian Revenue Service or Indian Railway Traffic Service have moved to pay band IV (director/joint secretary).        
	The parliamentary standing committees 54th, 59th, 83rd and 117th reports indicate the Union government was to blame for the discrepancies in promotions.         
	Anomalies arose because the government recruited the officials for a paramilitary force but prohibited them from joining organised central services Group A, such as the revenue service and the Indian Railway Traffic Service, by taking fresh examinations, the reports say.        
	Many officers in the CISF have been patient so far, but sources said some might write to home minister P. Chidambaram and the President.        
	In the case of the RAW officials, the department promotion committee met recently after four years. The meetings were not held by RAW for four years for 1973, 1974 and 1975 batch officers while IPS batchmates were promoted.

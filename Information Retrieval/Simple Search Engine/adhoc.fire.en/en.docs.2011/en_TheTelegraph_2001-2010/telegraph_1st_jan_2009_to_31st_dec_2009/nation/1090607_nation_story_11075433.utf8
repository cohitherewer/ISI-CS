          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, June 6: The Trinamul Congress plans to use the recent bouts of political violence in Bengal and the murder of a party activist to bolster its demand for central intervention in the state.        
	Railway minister Mamata Banerjee will raise before the Union cabinet her concerns over the murder of party worker Judhistir Dolui, who was allegedly burnt to death by CPM activists in Khanakul on Wednesday, Trinamul sources said.        
	This case reinforces what we have been saying, that there is no safety for any dissenting voice in Bengal. We plan to raise this murder at the coming cabinet meeting, a senior Trinamul leader said.        
	The Trinamul chief yesterday asked party MP and Union minister of state Mukul Roy to travel to Khanakul and prepare a report on Doluis death. She will hand over Roys report to home minister P. Chidambaram, party sources said.         
	Mamata, they said, has already spoken to Chidambaram on Doluis murder.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bikes bear brunt, spare lives
                                                                                                               Bikes bear brunt, spare lives
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Guwahati, April 6: Thanks to a row of some 15 motorbikes, many people were spared death today.        
	Police and forensic officials at the Maligaon blast site said the bicycle bomb  wedged in between an off-white Alto and a row of bikes in the parking lot  may have claimed many more lives had the two-wheelers not taken the impact of the explosion on one side.        
	If the bikes were not there, God knows how many people would have died. When there are no vehicles there, there are people, said Ganesh Roy, who had stepped out of Chayaram building barely 10 minutes before the bomb went off.        
	A police officer said there was no knowing how many would have died since the building bustled with people between 9am and 5pm on weekdays. Many waited in the parking lot too.         
	The building houses two diagnostic centres, BSNL and Assam State Electricity Board payment counters and the office of the Nehru Yuva Kendra Sanghathan.        
	Had the bikes and the vehicle not been there, the death toll could have been much higher. Especially the bikes, because they were on the side people enter and leave the building, a police officer said.

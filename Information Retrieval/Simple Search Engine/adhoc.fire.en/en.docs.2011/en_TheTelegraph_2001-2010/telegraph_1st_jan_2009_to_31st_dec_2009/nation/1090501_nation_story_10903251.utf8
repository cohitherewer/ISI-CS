The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | WARDROBE                                                                                                                            WARDROBE OF THE VOTESEEKER amp; THE VOTER 
                                          
	Priyanka Gandhi, told yet again that she looked like hergrandmothe r and even dressed like her, said with a giggle on Tuesday: This is Indirajis sari. (See picture) Her comment and Priyankas wardrobe for the campaign cotton saris often teamed a contrast white with blouse  have become a talking point. The Telegraph asked two sari specialists what they thought about it  
	Rta Kapur Chishti
  Author of Saris of India  
	It is wonderful to have a young person in saris on a campaign. It shows commitment and respect for people in the country  
	Shaina Nana Chudasama
  Designs and drapes saris and also happens to be BJP spokesperson for Maharashtra  
	THE INDIRA EFFECT: ldquo;I think a lot of us epitomise our grandparents rsquo; style. Priyanka Gandhi carries off her grandma rsquo;s saris beautifully. rdquo;   
	THE SARI THAT SUITED HER MOST: ldquo;I loved the burgundy sari with an orange border she wore. rdquo;  
	WHAT SHE CAN DO DIFFERENTLY: ldquo;She rsquo;s too young to always wear white and off-white saris. I also feel she could modify the blouses a bit mdash; her sleeves can go shorter and the colours can be different; contrast white blouses can work once in a while. rdquo;  
	Designer Sharbari Datta
  tells you how to preserve your grandma rsquo;s saris   
	 Priyanka Gandhi is wearing cotton saris that are easy to maintain because the cotton thread is very strong and durable  
	 Silk saris are high-maintenance  
	 Keep old saris folded on the racks. One basic rule is, never hang old saris, especially silks or saris with zari work. When a sari is left hanging for a long time, the threads start sagging and affect its longevity  
	 Change the fold of the saris mdash; fold them differently at least once every six months  
	 You can roll silks or saris with zari work in a piece of mulmul cloth  
	 Put a few black cumin seeds and red chillies in a cloth pouch and place it in a corner of the wardrobe; they act as great moth repellents  
	 Sun the saris over a period of seven to 10 days in autumn; the autumn sun is great for old saris  
	Now playing, Aam Aadmi:                 Actors Shah Rukh Khan, with wife Gauri, Aamir Khan and Hrithik Roshan, with wife Suzanne, dress down as they queue up to vote with ordinary Mumbaikars        
	Oye, it rsquo;s not Friday:                S. Ramadorai, CEO of Tata Consultancy Services, has gone casual a day too early.  Industrialist Anil Ambani jogs straight to the polling booth, in his tracks and trainers.  Gentlemen, would you go to the boardroom like this? HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh 
  could, though              
	Power of the finger:  
	 The Bachchans are dressed for the occasion.   
	Does it have anything to do with their brush with politics? Amitabh was a politician and Jaya is one.   
	Aishwarya opted for the middle way in white top and jeans. But it rsquo;s Abhishek   who rsquo;s chosen to spread the right word. Don rsquo;t miss the message on his T-shirt.   Can you spot a difference between the men and the women? It rsquo;s about the power of the finger          
	Look who rsquo;s hot:  
	Writer Shobhaa De sure knows how to accessorise right mdash; a ring that covers her ldquo;poll rdquo; finger and a fan to beat the heat in the queue      
	Walk the talk? Too busy          
	Elections have to be taken seriously if you are a responsible citizen, actress Shilpa Shetty wrote on her blog. She also posted a video of herself asking everybody to vote: ldquo;Please go vote and make a difference rdquo;. But Shilpa herself was too busy cheering her team in South Africa to come back and ldquo;make a difference rdquo;
    
	Salman Khan, star campaigner for candidates across party lines, was not spotted at the 
  polling booth either. The buzz was he is in London

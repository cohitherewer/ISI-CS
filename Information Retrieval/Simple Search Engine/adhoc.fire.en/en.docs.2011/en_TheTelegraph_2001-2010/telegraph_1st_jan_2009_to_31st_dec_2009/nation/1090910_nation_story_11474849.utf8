The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | 100 days of a trip downhill
                                                                                                               100 days of a trip downhill
          G.C. SHEKHAR                          Jayalalithaa: In charge, from a distance                                  
	Chennai, Sept. 9: For Jayalalithaa, its been one hundred days of solitude and gradual slipping of the ground beneath her feet.        
	Smarting from the electoral no-show, the ADMK chief has been cooling her heels since May 30 at a mountain retreat in Kodanadu, near Ooty, some 535km from here.         
	Her self-imposed exile has coincided with hundred days of the UPA government, of which the DMK, her enemy number one, is a part.        
	For the last 100 days, Jayalalithaa has been closeted in a massive white bungalow situated on a sprawling 862-acre tea and cardamom estate owned by her and her close aide Sasikala.         
	But even while remote-controlling her party from Kodanadu, Jayalalithaa has seen a further erosion in her support base.        
	It was sitting at the picturesque hill town that she took the ill-advised decision to boycott the Assembly byelections to five constituencies on August 18, unmindful that three of the seats had belonged to her alliance.         
	In her absence, DMDK leader Vijayakanth improved his electoral performance and consolidated his claim as an effective alternative to the DMK.        
	As if the byelection results, all of which went in favour of the DMK-Congress combine, werent enough of a blow, Jayalalithaa further reduced her partys strength in the Assembly by expelling two MLAs, reducing the ADMKs tally to 57 in the House of 234. One of them promptly joined the DMK while the other is flirting with its leaders.         
	Her absence from Chennai has given her rivals another round of ammunition to fire at her.         
	May be the climate at Kodanadu makes her commit such grievous mistakes. In that case, we would very much like her to stay put there, joked a DMK legislator.        
	But ADMK functionaries pointed out that it was wrong to perceive that Jayalalithaa was not involving herself in party work.         
	The partys executive met there once, senior party functionaries and MLAs have been meeting her regularly for taking instructions. Our leader has been directing our functionaries on the type of agitation programmes that we should hold. What she would have done in Chennai she is doing from Kodanadu. So whats the big deal? asked a former ADMK minister.        
	Another party senior disclosed that Jayalalithaa had actually shortlisted the candidates for the next Assembly elections, which she feels will be held in 2010, a year ahead of schedule, based on feedback received from district units.         
	Political commentator Cho Ramaswamy, a known Jayalalithaa supporter, defended Ammas penchant for operating from Kodanadu.         
	How would the ADMK have fared any better if she had taken the same decisions from Chennai? In this age of communication, one can operate from anywhere. And Kodanadu is very much in Tamil Nadu, he argued.        
	ADMK sources said Jayalalithaa is using her stay in Kodanadu for ayurvedic treatment for physical and mental rejuvenation.         
	Her astrologers have also advised her to return to Chennai only after Sani Peyearchi (the transition of Saturn) later this month. They are confident that their Puratchi Thalaivi (revolutionary leader) will return to Chennai a more confident and vigorous leader who will tackle all issues head-on, said a party leader.

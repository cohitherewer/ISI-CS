                                                                                                               Uma work tip for Arun 
                            
	New Delhi, March 18: Uma Bharti has an advice for Arun Jaitley: Come back to work!         
	The expelled leader, who has pledged to work for L.K. Advani in this election, told reporters today: Arun Jaitley is like my elder brother. He should forget his grudge and work for Advani with all his might. He can settle scores after the election. This is the time when none of us should create any hurdle.         
	Asked if she had abandoned her main charge of Jait- leys off-the-record briefing to select media persons, she said: Thats still an issue but these can be sorted out after the election.

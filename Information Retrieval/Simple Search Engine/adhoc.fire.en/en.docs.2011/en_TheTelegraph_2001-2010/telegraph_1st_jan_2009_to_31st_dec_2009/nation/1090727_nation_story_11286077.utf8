The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Buddha meets Pranab at airport
                                                                                                               Buddha meets Pranab at airport
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 26: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee met Pranab Mukherjee at Calcutta airport this afternoon where the chief minister is said to have discussed Aila relief and sought central help to cope with the near-drought situation in Bengal.        
	Both leaders were mum on the meeting, which lasted around half an hour.        
	Sources said the appointment of state industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen as the Calcutta Port Trust chairman also figured in the meeting. The sources said Bhattacharjee requested Mukherjee to smoothen the process of Sens appointment.        
	Mamata is believed to have reservations about Sen as he had played a key role in land acquisition for industrial projects. The chief minister is said to be keen on Sen in view of the role the port trust will play in implementing the chemical hub in Nayachar, off Haldia.        
	Mamatas consent is important not only because she leads the second largest party in the UPA but also because Trinamuls Mukul Roy is Union minister of state for shipping, which oversees port trusts.        
	The question of who would be the new Bengal governor is also said to have come up during the talks given that Gopalkrishna Gandhis tenure ends this December.        
	Media reports had referred to the name of Sontosh Mohan Dev, the former Union heavy industry minister and Congress leader from Assam, but sources said the matter had not reached the Congress leadership. Besides, Devs equation with Mamata is not good now. The Trinamul chief is known to be keen on a second innings for Gandhi.        
	The CPMs relations with Dev had improved after he helped reopen some industrial units in Bengal when he was Union minister. Neither Mamata nor Pranababu sounded me so far on the issue, said Dev, who had lost the Lok Sabha polls from Silchar.

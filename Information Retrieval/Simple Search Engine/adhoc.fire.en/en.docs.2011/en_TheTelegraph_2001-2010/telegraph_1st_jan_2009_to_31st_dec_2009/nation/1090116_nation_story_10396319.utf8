The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | US sets up food and drug office in India 
                                                                                                               US sets up food and drug office in India 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 15: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) opened its first office in India today as part of a new initiative to ensure safety and quality of drugs and food products flowing from India into the US.         
	The FDA will post 10 officials in India who plan to work with industries that export food and medical products to the US, providing technical advice and conducting inspections of production facilities that export to the US.         
	The Indian pharmaceutical industry had exported drugs worth about $7.4 billion (Rs 363.6 billion) last year. India is the fourth largest exporter by volume of drugs, including generic pharmaceuticals, to the US.         
	The FDA has also established offices in China, Central America and Europe.         
	Its officers will help industries build good manufacturing processes to ensure safety and quality of products. The goal is to build quality in (into the manufacturing processes) rather than inspect defects out, said Andrew C. von Eschenbach, the FDA commissioner.         
	Consumers in India and the US will benefit from enhanced safety of food, drugs, and medical devices, Mike Leavitt, secretary of the US department of health and human services said. Both Eschenbach and Leavitt spoke this evening through a video link from Washington DC.         
	The FDA officers hope to work with Indian government agencies and the private sector to develop certification programmes to allow the efficient flow of safe FDA-regulated products between India and the US.         
	If called upon, we are also prepared to work with the Indian government as it strengthens its own regulatory institutions, Leavitt said.         
	The Indian government is currently trying to strengthen the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation, the main agency responsible for regulating drugs, clinical trials and medical devices.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | IIT plan to lure foreign students with seats and aid
                                                                                                               IIT plan to lure foreign students with seats and aid
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 14: The Indian Institutes of Technology are planning to create a special pool of extra seats for foreign students in their postgraduate courses, for the first time even proposing financial incentives to lure bright students from abroad.         
	The IITs have proposed streamlining an unattractive current admission process for foreign students that the institutes argue is robbing their students of international competition and crucial funds in dollars.         
	The proposal is scheduled to be discussed by the IIT Council  the highest decision-making body of the institutes  at its meeting here on October 19, top IIT officials told The Telegraph.         
	If accepted, the proposal could significantly help alter the character of the IITs from Indias leading institutions to global hubs of excellence, IIT officials said.         
	The IITs have argued in the proposal that the presence of foreign students in their postgraduate classrooms will improve competition for Indian students, helping improve overall standards, a source said.         
	Unofficially, officials accepted that the institutes also hoped to benefit financially from the higher fees  at dollar rates  that students from outside the Saarc countries will be charged.         
	At present, the IITs very rarely receive any applications from foreign students for their postgraduate courses  despite no official ban on their studying at the institutes.         
	This proposal, if accepted, could transform an infrequent trickle of applications into a steady flow, a senior IIT official said.         
	Human resource development minister Kapil Sibal, the chairman of the IIT Council, is unlikely to oppose the proposal in principle, ministry sources said.         
	The minister firmly believes in the virtues of competition in improving quality standards. There appears no reason why the ministry should oppose encouraging foreign students joining the IITs, an official said.         
	The IITs offer postgraduate courses in engineering, pure sciences, applied sciences, design and management.         
	Self-financing foreign students can apply directly to an IIT, seeking admission to a particular postgraduate course. They have to send their scores at the undergraduate stage by December of the previous year.         
	The IIT concerned considers the application and then proposes to the HRD ministry that the student be accepted  if the institute wishes to admit him or her.         
	The HRD ministry then seeks approval from the home ministry. After the home ministry approves the application, the IIT formally invites the foreign student.         
	Different IITs at present follow independent procedures for admitting foreign students  even though they conduct postgraduate entrance examinations for Indian students jointly.         
	In the proposal to be discussed on October 19, IIT directors have suggested setting up a panel of institute officials to evolve a new admission procedure that will include creating extra seats over the existing intake.         
	The proposal suggests putting in place a cap on the percentage of the total intake that foreign students can comprise.         
	The IITs may also have to follow a common admission procedure for foreign postgraduate students if the proposal is accepted.         
	The most meritorious students among the foreign applicants can also be offered financial assistance, the IITs have said in their proposal.         
	The IIT Council will also discuss a proposal from the institutes to increase the number of post-doctoral fellowships and the amount offered as remuneration to the fellows, it is learnt.

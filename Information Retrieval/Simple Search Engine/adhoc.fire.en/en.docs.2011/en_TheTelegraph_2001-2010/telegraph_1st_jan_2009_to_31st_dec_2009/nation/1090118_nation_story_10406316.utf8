The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Brand Kashmir on London ramp
                                                                                                               Brand Kashmir on London ramp
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                              
	Srinagar, Jan. 17: Asian and British models donning embroidered phirans and delicately knit Kashmiri shawls are set to walk the ramp in London in the first fashion show ever to promote Brand Kashmir.        
	The idea behind the month-long festival that will begin on Tuesday is to showcase Kashmirs famed handicrafts from sozni (intricate needlework) and pashmina shawls to silk carpets and embroidered garments. Walnut kernels and saffron will also be on show.        
	We have booked 3,000sqft of space in central London for the exhibition and will set up 30 stalls to display our goods to customers, said Mubeen Shah, the president of the Kashmir chamber of commerce and industry.        
	This is a joint venture between Kashmir Inc and the ministry of commerce to promote Brand Kashmir.         
	Around 20 Kashmiri businessmen are participating in the festival whose main attraction is the fashion show.        
	We are organising it with the support of Britains Asiana magazine and will be booking a five-star hotel for the fashion show. Around 400 people, many from the fashion and tourism industry, will be invited but the models will be from Britain and Asia, Shah said.        
	We are also showing a film to promote our tourism and handicraft.        
	Jammu and Kashmirs tourism department has made the film on prominent tourist resorts in the state as well as some unknown destinations that have great potential. Tourism department officials said the organisers had invited chief minister Omar Abdullah for the festival but he was unlikely to go.        
	The chief minister is careful about local sensitivities in Kashmir and a fashion show is certainly something new here, a source close to him said.         
	Tourism and handicrafts were badly hit when militancy erupted in the state. The recent Amarnath agitation only made matters worse.        
	A lot of places are in turmoil but tourists keep going there. So why wouldnt they come to Kashmir? asked Shah.        
	Pawan Kotwal, the commissioner secretary of the industries and commerce department, said the basic aim of the festival was to promote Kashmiri products overseas.        
	This is the time when people come and finalise deals in London. The exhibition will be a big platform for people to book orders and ink other deals because we are doing a marketing exercise for Brand Kashmir, he said.        
	Last year, Jammu and Kashmir got its premier pashmina shawl craft registered for a geographical indicator patent. At that time, Pakistan claimed pashmina and sozni were practised in their part of Kashmir as well.        
	Although many existing Kashmiri crafts have a global market, machine-made fakes have been dealing a blow to artisans and the crafts themselves. Hence, the rush to patent the crafts.        
	Kashmir has already lost the battle for Brand Cashmere, which originated in the state and was used exclusively in pashmina craft. The brand has now become generic and is used extensively in the West.

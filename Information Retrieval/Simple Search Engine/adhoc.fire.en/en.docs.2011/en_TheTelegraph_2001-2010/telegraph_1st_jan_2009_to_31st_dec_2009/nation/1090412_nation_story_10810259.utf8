          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, April 11: Five CRPF jawans were killed in a Maoist ambush in Jharkhands Khunti district today, 40km from the spot where Sonia Gandhi addressed her first rally in the state.        
	The rebels targeted the jawans, all in their mid-thirties, while they were patrolling in the Jalko forests of Khunti district, about 50km from Ranchi, around 4am.        
	It appears the rebels had already taken position on the hills in the forests, said S.N. Pradhan, the state police spokesperson. When the jawans were passing through, they opened fire.        
	Pradhan said the CRPF men had been tipped off that the Maoists were planning a strike in the forests and had been told to scour the area.         
	The CRPF men had been assigned to cleanse the area of Maoists after this information came in.

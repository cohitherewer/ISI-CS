	New Delhi, Jan. 29: Campus predators beware  the countrys top court today said it might lay down a fresh set of rules to check sexual harassment in institutes of learning.        
	The intention should be to create a situation where such incidents (of harassment) are prevented and not wait to take action after they have happened, a bench headed by the chief justice said.        
	The effort should be to prevent such anti-social occurrences, Supreme Court Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan added.        
	The bench directed senior counsel Colin Gonsalves to draft within six weeks suggestions the court could order educational institutions to implement.        
	Such norms could be communicated to all educational institutions, the court added.        
	The directive came as the court resumed hearing a petition filed by Medha Kotwal Lele, a teacher and a victim of sexual harassment.        
	The move to frame a fresh set of guidelines came over 11 years after the courts Vishakha judgment. The 1997 judgment made it mandatory for shops, factories and commercial establishments with more than 10 employees to set up committees to deal with complaints of sexual harassment and recommend disciplinary action if they thought fit.        
	The committees had to be headed by a woman. Also, a majority of the members on the panel had to be women.        
	The court ruled that use of suggestive language, even without bodily contact, and showing pornographic material, suggestive photographs, printed or otherwise, would amount to sexual harassment.        
	The guidelines, however, do not cover educational institutions and professional bodies like the Medical Council of India and the Bar Council of India.        
	In 2007, the court issued notices to the University Grants Commission, the bar and medical councils, the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the All India Council For Technical Education on extending the existing guidelines to campuses, but not much came of it.        
	When the court today resumed hearing the petition filed by Lele, Gonsalves cited the policy Delhi University follows.        
	He said the measures introduced by DU  among them more policing on the campus and restriction on entry of outsiders  could be adopted across the country. The court then asked him to frame draft guidelines.

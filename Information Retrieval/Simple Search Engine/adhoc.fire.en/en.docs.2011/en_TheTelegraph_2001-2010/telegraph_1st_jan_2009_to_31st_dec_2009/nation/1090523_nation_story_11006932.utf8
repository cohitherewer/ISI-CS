The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Weak Opp. boon for new govt
                                                                                                               Weak Opp. boon for new govt
          SUBRAT DAS                              
	Bhubaneswar, May 22: The newly constituted Assembly has thrown up a weak Opposition with the BJD sweeping the elections and the Congress and BJP suffering serious setback.        
	The BJD has got 103 seats in the 147-member House alone and its allies NCP and CPI have won another five this year. The strength of the Congress, the main Opposition party, on the other hand, has been reduced to 27 from 38 in the previous Assembly. BJP could only muster up six seats against 32 in 2004. Half of the six Independents elected to the House are likely to support the government. Thus, the strength of Opposition has gone down to 36 against 47.        
	Though quantitatively there has not been much difference this time, the Opposition has suffered a heavy loss on the quality side because of absence of several heavyweights.        
	Veteran Congress leader and three-time chief minister J.B. Patnaik, who had occupied the post of Leader of Opposition in the previous Assembly, will be missed, as he chose not to contest the polls this time. Similarly, absence of deputy leader of Opposition in the erstwhile Assembly, Narasingha Mishra, who used to play a dominant role by virtue of his oratory and knowledge in rules of the House, will be felt. Mishra had this time contested the Lok Sabha polls unsuccessfully and opted out of the state legislature.        
	Veteran tribal leader Ulaka Ramachandra, who had a brief stint as Leader of Opposition after the resignation of J.B. Patnaik a few weeks before the elections, and Opposition chief whip Satya Bhusan Sahu have also lost the Assembly polls. Another veteran Habibulla Khan, who had been elected to the Assembly consecutively for nine times since 1971, could not make it this time as his constituency Nowrangpur was reserved for the ST.        
	The other Congress heavyweights defeated in the polls included former ministers Nalinikanta Mohanty, Ramakrushna Patnaik among others.

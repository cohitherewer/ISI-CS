                                                                                                               Balco toll rises to 41
          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, Sept. 29: Relief and rescue operations at Bharat Aluminium Company Limited (Balco) ended with officials confirming the final death toll at 41, a week after the collapse of a 100 metre high under-construction chimney.        
	The operation was officially concluded last evening and 41 bodies were recovered from the debris, Korba collector Ashok Agrawal said. The teams, he said, had dug deep inside the crash site and there was practically no chance of recovering any more bodies from the site.         
	The Balco management, however, continued its own operations till this morning. The debris has been cleared and in all, bodies of 41 people were recovered from the site, Balco corporate communications chief B.K. Sriwastava confirmed.         
	The under-construction chimney at the site of Balcos proposed 1200MW power plant collapsed on September 23. A Chinese company, Sepco, had awarded the contract of constructing the chimney to an Indian company, GDCL.         
	Initially, 24 bodies were recovered, while dozens of workers were trapped inside the debris of heavy concrete and mangled metallic structures that were being used to build the 100 metre high chimney that came crashing down.        
	Rescue teams had a tough time to cut metal pieces and clear the debris. After local experts failed, the state government urged the Centre to rush a team of National Disaster Response Force. As many as 108 jawans from NDRFs Mundali centre in Orissa reached Korba on Saturday and took over the rescue operations.         
	Sources in the district administration claimed that this was the biggest rescue operation in the country so far.

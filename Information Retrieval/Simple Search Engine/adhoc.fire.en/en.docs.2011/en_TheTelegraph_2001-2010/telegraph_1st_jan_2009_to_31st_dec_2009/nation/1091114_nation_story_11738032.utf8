          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 13: Indias proposed new higher education accreditation regime will for the first time impose fines and jail terms on rating agencies or officials who rate universities and colleges better or worse than they deserve.         
	A law to set up the accreditation framework will not just allow a new watchdog to disqualify rating firms but also empower regulatory authorities to start civil or criminal cases if corruption is alleged.         
	The proposed law will also allow institutions or ordinary citizens who are victims of corruption involving accreditation to file civil cases against officials concerned, top government officials said. Citizens or institutions will need sanction from the regulatory authority for prosecution against the accused.         
	Government rating agencies like the National Accreditation and Assessment Council and the National Board of Accreditation and private firms, to be now allowed into higher education rating, will be covered under the clauses. Academics who scrutinise claims of an institution on behalf of a rating firm are liable to be punished, ministry sources said.         
	The proposed law  the National Authority for Regulation in Accreditation of Higher Educational Institutions Bill  is under the scrutiny of the law ministry, the HRD sources said.         
	 Accreditation involves rating on the basis of measurable parameters like faculty strength, infrastructure, transparency in admission and evaluation procedures. Wrongdoing will be established by pinning down discrepancies between the rating of an institution and its performance on the parameters.

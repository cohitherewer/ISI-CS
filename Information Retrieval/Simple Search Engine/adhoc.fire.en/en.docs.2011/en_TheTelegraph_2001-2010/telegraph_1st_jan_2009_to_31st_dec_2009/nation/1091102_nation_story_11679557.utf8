	Cuttack, Nov. 1: Oncologists at Acharya Harihar Regional Cancer Centre are worried over the recent rise in cases of breast cancer in Orissa.        
	Most of the states women are afflicted with cancer of the breast, followed by cervical cancer. Records at the regional cancer centre goes on to show that the disease claims the maximum number of patients in Orissa. During 2008-09, there were 969 reported cases of cervical cancer, while 1,496 women were affected by cancer of the breast. Cases were 20 to 30 per cent less than cervical cancer till 2007, said professor K.B. Das, the director of the centre.        
	The institute, one of the 29 state-run ones in the country, conducts research to help detection and treatment. The centre caters to patients from the state as well as from neighbouring states of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh.         
	Oncologists attributed the higher incidences to changes in the lifestyle such as late motherhood, less instances of breastfeeding among new mothers and later date for menopause. High body mass index associated with fatty diet was also attributed as a factor in the rise of cancer cases.         
	High intake of fruits and vegetables and regular exercise is known to reduce the risk factor, doctors assured.         
	Since prevention was better than cure, the centre has embarked on a programme for early detection at the district level.         
	After Cuttack, Balasore, Jagatsinghpur and Khurda District Cancer Control Programmes, the same would be launched in Kendrapada, Bhadrak and Jajpur, said Sukadev Nayak, head of the centres palliative care unit.         
	Along with awareness sessions, the programme would work for early detection, treatment, pain and palliative care, Nayak added.         
	There are 50 lakh cases of breast cancer in India. In urban areas, every 34 women in a population of a lakh suffer from breast cancer. In rural areas, the number is eight in a lakh.         
	According to projections, an estimated 80,000 cases are expected to be added every year and finally one in every 17 women in the country would be likely to develop breast cancer.

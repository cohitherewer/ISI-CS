The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sibal issues gag orders
                                                                                                               Sibal issues gag orders
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 8: Kapil Sibal has banned all officials except secretaries from speaking to the media in a move that contrasts with the governments stated intent to increase transparency.        
	Less than a fortnight after taking over as human resource development minister, Sibal has issued an official notification that says no one other than secretary-rank officials should speak to the media.        
	Under service rules applicable to central government employees across ministries, secretaries and joint secretaries can talk to the media but junior officials cannot. Sibals order extends the prohibition to joint secretaries.        
	The ministers aides argued that the order became essential after instances of what they alleged was misreporting by a couple of Delhi-based dailies and a news agency over the past week.        
	The move, however, contrasts with specific assurances made in the Presidents address to Parliament on June 4.        
	Pratibha Patil had promised a public data policy to voluntarily make all non-strategic information available to the public and said the Right to Information Act would be strengthened.        
	The government, she had assured the Houses, would bring out quarterly reports on key areas of the UPAs focus, including education. An independent evaluation office would be set up in the Planning Commission to monitor the use of government funds and the implementation of flagship projects.        
	After taking charge of the HRD ministry, Sibal has initiated reviews of several controversial decisions taken by his predecessor. Under Arjun Singh, however, joint secretaries were allowed to speak to the media, like their counterparts in other ministries.

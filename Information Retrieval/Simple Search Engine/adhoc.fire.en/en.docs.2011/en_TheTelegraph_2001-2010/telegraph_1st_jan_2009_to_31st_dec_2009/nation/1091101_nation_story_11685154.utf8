The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Genetic brinjal opposed
                                                                                                               Genetic brinjal opposed
                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 31 (PTI): The Chhattisgarh government has sought the intervention of Union environment minister Jairam Ramesh to disallow commercial cultivation of genetically modified brinjal in the country.        
	We are seeking the intervention of the environment minister to stop commercial cultivation of BT brinjal. We have already sent letters to Jairam Ramesh and Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar, Chhattisgarh agriculture minister Chandrashekhar Sahu said.        
	The biotechnology regulator, the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee, had on October 14 cleared BT brinjal for commercial use. The Union government is, however, yet to take a decision.        
	Sahu said the committees decision was taken in haste to serve vested commercial interests of multinational companies such as Monsanto which are involved in developing genetically modified crops.        
	Before approving commercial cultivation of such crops, the government should draw up a proper policy in consultation with the Indian Council of Agricultural Research and other similar organisations, the minister said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chennai, June 25: P. Chidambarams election from Sivaganga has been challenged in court by his nearest defeated rival from the ADMK, who claims mischief during counting.        
	Chidambaram had scraped through by 3,552 votes, recording the narrowest of his seven victories from the Tamil Nadu Lok Sabha seat.        
	The ADMK candidate, Raja Kannappan, filed a petition in Madras High Court today alleging Chidambaram had used his position as home minister to influence the counting.        
	Kannappan claimed he had led right through the first 10 rounds of counting on May 16 and the media had flashed reports of his victory.         
	He said Chidambaram and his son Karti had left the counting centre, virtually admitting defeat, by 12.30pm. However, counting was suspended for a while and, after the next five rounds when the votes from the Alangudi Assembly segment were totted up, the returning officer declared Chidambaram the winner.        
	The votes polled in my favour had been transferred to Chidambaram. If the counting had been fair and transparent, I would have won by a margin of over 7,000 votes, Kannappan claimed.        
	He said he had demanded the votes be checked again but the returning officer told him that only the Election Commission could take a decision on that. Kannappan also alleged that Chidambaram distributed money among voters and that ADMK workers had caught Karti with bundles of 500-rupee notes. The petition has been filed within the statutory period of 45 days from the declaration of results.         
	A good lawyer can drag the hearing in the high court for up to two years. In case he gets an unfavourable verdict, he can challenge it in the Supreme Court and drag it for the next two to three years. By then the winners term would end, a former advocate-general of Tamil Nadu said.

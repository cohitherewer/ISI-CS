          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, Feb. 22: The district unit of the states Bengali association yesterday demonstrated in front of the Gaya district magistrates office demanding the appointment of Bengali teachers in government primary schools.         
	The schools are currently recruiting teachers and the association was pressing for the appointment of more teachers who could teach Bengali.         
	The protest was organised on the eve of the International Mother Language Day, observed on February 21.        
	Ashish Kumar Ghoshal, N.C. Bhattacharya and Shambhu Nath Banerjee, the office-bearers of the Gaya unit of the association, led the protests.        
	The group handed over a memorandum, addressed to chief minister Nitish Kumar, to the district magistrate.        
	Quoting Articles 29 and 30 of the Constitution, the memorandum stated that in the country linguistic minority groups had the right to education in their own medium.        
	They pointed out that Bihars Bengali population could be recognised as a linguistic minority.         
	Bihar is facing an acute shortage of Bengali teachers, they added.         
	According to the memorandum, there are 36,000 Bengali students in three districts of the state and the total number of teachers is 59.         
	The new rules create 15,000 new posts for Urdu teachers in the state, but none for Bengali, said the association members.        
	The association demanded 2,950 posts for teachers who could teach Bengali in each and every area where there were 10 or more Bengali students.         
	The two-page representation written in Hindi also wondered about the worth of printing Bengali textbooks by the state-owned Textbook Corporation at all, if there were no teachers to utilise the copy.

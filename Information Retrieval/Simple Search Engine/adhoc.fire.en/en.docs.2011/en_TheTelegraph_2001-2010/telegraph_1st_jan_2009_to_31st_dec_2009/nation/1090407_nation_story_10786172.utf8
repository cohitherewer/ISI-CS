The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pro-Left group to support Tharoor
                                                                                                               Pro-Left group to support Tharoor
          JOHN MARY                           Tharoor: Widening base                                  
	Thiruvananthapuram, April 6: Congress candidate Shashi Tharoor has received crucial support from Keralas powerful Ezhava community, which accounts for 22 per cent of the states population and has traditionally voted Left.        
	The endorsement is a huge boost for the former UN official at a time several Muslim organisations have targeted him because of his alleged pro-Israel opinions.        
	The Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam, which largely represents the Ezhavas, a backward Hindu group, has asked its local leaders to work for Tharoors victory in Thiruvananthapuram.        
	The bad news for the Left Democratic Front is that the Yogam is backing not only Tharoor but a host of other candidates of the Congress-led United Democratic Front this time in a departure from its traditional position.        
	Yogam general secretary Vellapally Natesan said the organisations annual general body had today formulated its stand on most of the 20 Lok Sabha constituencies, based on candidates attitude towards the Ezhavas.        
	Natesan did not reveal the list of favoured candidates lest it antagonise other communities. The list, however, has been passed on to Yogam office-bearers in the constituencies.        
	Tharoor, Natesan said, should get the support of all sections of society, irrespective of their political or community affiliations.        
	Muslim organisations such as the Jamaat-e-Islami are against Tharoor because he allegedly justified Israeli action in Gaza in his syndicated column. Tharoor appeared to deny the allegation at a TV show on Saturday night.        
	Sources revealed the Yogams tentative positions on 15 constituencies, which involve support to at least nine UDF candidates.        
	Apart from Tharoor, they are Peethampara Kurup (Kollam), Kodikunnil Suresh (Mavelikara), Jose K. Mani (Kottayam), K.V. Thomas (Ernakulam), K.P. Dhanapalan (Chalakudy), E.T. Mohammed Basheer (Ponnani), junior foreign minister E. Ahmed (Malappuram) and Anto Antony (Pathanamthitta).        
	Only two Left candidates  sitting MP Francis George (Kerala Congress) in Idukki and A. Sampath (CPM) in Attingal  figure among the chosen.        
	Congress candidates K.K. Sudhakaran (Kannur) and M.K. Raghavan (Kozhikode) are likely to get Yogam backing. Ezhava support will be crucial for them since both have been able to create a buzz in their constituencies, now represented by the Left.        
	In his home constituency of Alappuzha, Natesan is yet to decide between K.C. Venugopal (Congress) and K.S. Manoj (CPM). Sitting MP Venugopal had crossed swords with Natesan but has been trying to ease the strain through a common friend.        
	A decision is yet to be taken on Wayanad, where K. Karunakarans son, K Muraleedharan, is the Nationalist Congress Party candidate. The Yogam will think of supporting him only if it decides he has a sure chance of victory against M.I. Shanavaz (Congress) and M. Rahamathullah (CPI).

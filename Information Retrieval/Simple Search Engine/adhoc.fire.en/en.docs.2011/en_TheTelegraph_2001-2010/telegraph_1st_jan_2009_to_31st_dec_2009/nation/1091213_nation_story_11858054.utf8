          A STAFF REPORTER                                          Firemen try to extricate a body from the wrecked car on Red Road in Calcutta on Saturday night. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya        
	Calcutta, Dec. 12: Three school students aged between 18 and 19 died when their car apparently jumped lanes and collided with a truck near the main gate of Fort William on Saturday night.        
	The students  all residents of central Calcutta  had set out for a spin around the Maidan in a Tata Indica when the accident occurred.         
	Two other passengers  one of which is a 21-year-old youth who owns the car  were injured. The front half of the car was reduced to mangled steel, prompting fire services personnel to use crowbars to make room to extricate the bodies.        
	The driver and helper of the truck fled immediately after the accident.        
	An eyewitness said the car, heading north towards the Raj Bhavan side, had switched lanes and come in the path of the truck which was moving southwards.        
	Around 10.15pm, I saw a truck heading towards the Police Training School. The car in which the youths were travelling came from the opposite direction. The car changed the lane at great speed and hit the truck, said Amit Gupta, who was standing near Fort William.        
	The dead have been identified as Sunil Hela, 18, Amit Das, 19, and an unidentified person who appeared to be in the same age bracket. The injured are Jitendra Hela, 18, and Anshuman Ganguly, 21.        
	Jitendra said he did not know the third casualty well enough to identify him but assumed that he was a classmate of Sunil and Amit. Anshuman and Jitendra are undergoing treatment at SSKM Hospital.        
	Jitendra, a Class XII student of a Collins School who lives in the Group D quarters of NRS Medical College and Hospital, said the five had assembled at Lebutala Park around 8pm for the fun ride.         
	The car belongs to Anshuman and he was driving it. He is our friend but does not study with us. I was in the right side of the rear seat and was chatting with the others when I realised that the car had gone into the wrong lane. Suddenly, it hit the truck with a loud sound. I somehow managed to come out of the car and slumped on the road, Jitendra said.        
	Police said they would carry out tests to establish if the driver of the car was inebriated.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Salary cut cry to fight drought 
                                                                                                               Salary cut cry to fight drought 
  - Sonia austerity appeal to ministers        RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Sonia Gandhi at the meeting. (Rajesh Kumar)                                        
	New Delhi, Aug. 19: Sonia Gandhi today asked Congress lawmakers and ministers to take a 20 per cent cut in salary for a year to express solidarity with those hit by the drought.        
	The voluntary cuts, beginning next month, were proposed by her at a meeting of the partys top decision-making body, the Congress Working Committee (CWC), to discuss the drought. The proposal covers the Prime Minster, central and state ministers, MPs, MLAs, councillors and heads of boards and statutory bodies.         
	At the meeting of the extended CWC, also attended by 10 of the partys 12 chief ministers, Sonia asked colleagues to ensure the conduct of their private and public lives reflected their concern for those suffering on account of drought and hardships beyond their control.        
	The members were surprised when a resolution calling for austerity practices was introduced. It is learnt that the original draft didnt mention prudence.         
	The issue was flagged off by Sonia on a piece of paper she hand-wrote while the meeting was on and was later incorporated.        
	But Sonias call spurred members to vie with each other to suggest dos and donts for the austerity drive.        
	Prominent among them was A.K. Antony. The defence minister proposed that MPs, including senior ministers, should fly economy class, avoid splurging and minimise foreign travel.         
	The finance minister and leader of the Lok Sabha, Pranab Mukherjee, was told that henceforth parliamentary standing committee meetings should be held in Delhi, not outside, to save on travel and hotel costs.         
	Asked how the Congresss contributions from the pay cuts, which will go to the Prime Ministers relief fund, would ameliorate the hardships, a general secretary said: It is a symbolic act.        
	Not everyone seemed happy with the symbolism, though. A Rajya Sabha MP, not known to be exactly cash-strapped, reminded the meeting that during past contingencies, such as in the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War, members had taken a 10 per cent slash. He wondered why it was 20 per cent now. A source quoted Sonia as telling him: That was about Bangladesh. We are now talking about our own country.        
	Health and family welfare minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, who a source said had only panic on his mind after the swine flu pandemic, reportedly said: We dont mind giving even 50 per cent (of the pay) but the move shouldnt seem like an over-reaction.        
	To this, another member, not known to be Azads best friend, replied: We routinely take salary cuts but it has never triggered a panic.         
	The CWC asked the government to take pro-active steps to contain prices. Nobody, except Arjun Singh, bought home minister P. Chidambarams suggestion that the Centre ought to vest the powers to check hoarders with itself instead of delegating them to states.                    
	The CWC asked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, present at the meeting, to replicate the Rajiv Gandhi Oilseeds Mission and extend it to include pulses.

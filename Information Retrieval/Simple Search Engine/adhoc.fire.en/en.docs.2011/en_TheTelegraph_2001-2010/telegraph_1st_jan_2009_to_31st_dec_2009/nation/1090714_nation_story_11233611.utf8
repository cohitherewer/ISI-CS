The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Gene trick for fresh tomatoes 
                                                                                                               Gene trick for fresh tomatoes

	New Delhi, July 13: Government scientists have developed tomatoes that stay fresh without refrigeration 10 to 12 days longer than ordinary tomatoes, using a biological trick that may help reduce Indias embarrassing wastage of fruits and vegetables.         
	India is the worlds second largest producer of fruits and vegetables after China, but agricultural scientists estimate that 25-30 per cent of the produce is spoilt each year in the absence of refrigerated long-distance transportation.         
	Now, scientists at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), New Delhi, are preparing to conduct the countrys first field trials of the delayed-ripening tomato they have developed by genetically engineering tomato plants.         
	Were going to get a tomato that stays fresh longer and has better nutrition, said Kailash Bansal, professor of molecular biology at IARIs National Research Centre for Plant Biotechnology.         
	Most tomato varieties grown across India are good for use for a week to 10 days. Some farmers harvest them before they are ripe so they get more time before the tomatoes spoil. (But) such early harvested tomatoes are not as nutritious as the ones picked only after they are ripe, Bansal said.         
	The IARI researchers used a genetic engineering technique to silence a single gene called ACC synthase that makes a key enzyme that produces ethylene  a chemical that plays a role in the ripening of tomatoes. When we block the production of this enzyme, we interfere with the ethylene synthesis process, and slow down the ripening, Bansal said.         
	The delayed-ripening tomato has already undergone tests in closed greenhouses at the IARI last year. Scientists expect the field trials, set to begin in October this year, to continue for about two years. Scientists say it could take at least three years before these tomatoes are ready to be sold.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Maid in your house trained by UN agency
                                                                                                               Maid in your house trained by UN agency
          CITHARA PAUL                          Ready for crash course?                                  
	New Delhi, July 7: The next time your maid drops cutlery or overlooks a dusty corner, dont give her a tongue-lashing. Instead, send her to be trained by the International Labour Organisation.        
	Your bai from the neighbourhood bustee is poised to beat her rivals across the world  from the trim Filipino maid to the stiff-upper-lip English butler  to an international status symbol.        
	She may soon boast a certification from the ILO, saying she has passed a three-level training programme conducted by the United Nations special agency for social justice and labour rights.        
	Apart from a crash course in cleaning, washing and cooking, the ILO will give her lessons in literacy, hygiene and punctuality, hoping you get improved service at your home and your maid has better job prospects and work conditions.        
	This is the first time the ILO has conceived this kind of a programme, and Delhi is our first choice, the UN agencys representative in India, Neelam Agnihotri, told The Telegraph.        
	So come July 11, the ILO will begin the pilot course in Delhi with about 250 trainees and in collaboration with the ministry of labour and employment. Later, the programme will take in more trainees and will be extended to other cities.        
	The programme, Skills Development Initiative for Domestic Workers/Household Assistants, is open to both male and female servants, to those entering the profession as well as veteran domestic workers seeking to improve their skills.        
	So if one feels ones current household help needs a little more training, they can send him or her to the re-skill programme, a labour ministry official said.        
	The entry-level training offers three courses: cleaning, washing and kitchen assistance plus training in literacy, safety and hygiene. The second and third-level programmes offer lessons in special skills such as cooking, elderly care and baby care.        
	The training will last between 80 and 130 hours, depending on the course. The fee is Rs 200 per course.        
	The programme is beneficial for the employer in two ways. One, a trained worker will give better service; two, one need not worry about the employees past since this will be verified by the training authorities, the ministry official said. It is good for the maids too since they will no longer be seen as mere kaamvaalis but as professionals.        
	The ILO has drawn up the training module but the actual training will be provided by public and private organisations accredited as vocational training providers by the ILO. Four placement agencies and two NGOs have signed up for the pilot phase in Delhi.        
	Each trainees performance will be evaluated by official assessing bodies selected by the ministry and certified by the National Council for Vocational Training (NCVT). Successful trainees will get an NCVT certificate bearing an ILO stamp, and will be registered as professional domestic workers.        
	Will the labour ministry fix a minimum wage for the trained maids? The official said for now, the ministry was just hoping that a rise in demand for the trained hands would raise their salaries.

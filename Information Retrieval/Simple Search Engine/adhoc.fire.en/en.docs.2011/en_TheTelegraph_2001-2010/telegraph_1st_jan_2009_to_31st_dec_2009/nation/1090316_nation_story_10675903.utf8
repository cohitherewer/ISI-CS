          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Patna, March 15: The Bihar chief electoral officer has issued a showcause notice to two top-ranking police officers, including director-general of police D.N. Gautam, for calling upon chief minister Nitish Kumar on the occasion of Holi at his 1 Anne Marg home.         
	Election officer Sudhir Rakesh has also sought a report on the two officers visiting the chief minister in personal capacity when the model code of conduct was in operation. Officials are not supposed to call upon a chief minister in personal capacity after the enforcement of the model code of conduct.         
	DGP Gautam and additional director-general (headquarters) Neelmani had met the chief minister in civvies on Holi. Reportedly, Nitish, too, had pointed out: that you should know who to meet when the model code of conduct is in place.         
	However, Neelmani today clarified that he and the DGP had not visited the CM in personal capacity.         
	We had briefed the CM on the law and order situation after the clash between two groups at Chapra on the day. We had gone in civvies because it was an emergency-call related to law and order and happened on the day of Holi. There was no motive behind the visit.         
	D.N. Gautam, considered an officer with an impeccable character, has a lobby of officers pitted against him who would like to see the last of Gautam.

	Meanwhile, the Election Commission shifted 30 sub-electoral officers posted in districts for the past three years. The notification was issued on Friday night. The officials have been directed to submit a report to the magistrates-cum-returning officers about their poll-related work in the past three years.

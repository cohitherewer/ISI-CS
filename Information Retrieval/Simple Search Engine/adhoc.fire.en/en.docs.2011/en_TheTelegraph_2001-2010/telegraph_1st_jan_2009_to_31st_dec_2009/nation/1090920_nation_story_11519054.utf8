The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Riot panel to scan Modi aides calls
                                                                                                               Riot panel to scan Modi aides calls
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Narendra Modi                                  
	Ahmedabad, Sept. 19: The panel probing the Godhra train fire and the riots it triggered has not summoned Narendra Modi but three of his officials have to reveal details of telephone conversations they had while Gujarat was burning.        
	Retired judges G.T. Nanavati and Akshay Mehta have asked the trio, personal assistants of the chief minister, to file affidavits with transcripts of their conversations with some of the suspects as well as politicians and police officers between February 27 and March 4, 2002.        
	Omprakash Singh, Tanmay Mehta and Sanjay Bhavsar have been specifically asked whether they had any telephonic talk with Ashok Bhatt, then health minister, Gordhan Zadaphia, then home minister, and VHP leader Jaydeep Patel, a riot accused who was jailed along with junior minister Mayaben Kodnani. Both are now out on bail.        
	The names of the three officials figure in CDs of phone call records submitted to the Nanavati-Mehta commission by IPS officer Rahul Sharma.        
	The probe commission, however, refused to summon Modi, though the state government had widened its scope through an amendment so that it could inquire into the role and conduct of the chief minister or any other minister and police officers.        
	The commission said it did not think it proper to summon the chief minister, home minister or any other minister on the basis of vague allegations or allegations based on wrong or unwarranted assumptions, turning down a plea by an NGO that represents riot victims.        
	The Jan Sangharsh Manch  which had moved an application for summoning Modi on the ground that cellphone records showed conversations between his aides, senior police officers and VHP leaders allegedly involved in the massacre  said it would challenge the decision.        
	We have decided to file a petition to challenge the order, advocate Mukul Sinha of JSM said.        
	We are not saying we will not summon the chief minister, Justice Mehta said in reply to a question. Our order is very clear. At the moment, we have asked three officials of the CMO to file affidavits. We need to verify certain information. And thats it.        
	The commission had earlier refused to accept the CDs submitted by former DCP Sharma, but now seems to have changed its mind, especially after the high court held the telephone conversations as evidence against VHP leader Jaydeep Patel and Kodnani.        
	In view of the scope and nature of inquiry, though it does not justify issuing summons to the persons who are alleged to be the owners of those phones, the data, if found not manipulated, is likely to help this commission in finding out the truth about involvement of those persons, the commission said.        
	The commissions report on the first part of its inquiry has given a clean chit to Modi. It says there is no evidence to show there was any lapse in Modis or his ministers role in providing protection, relief and rehabilitation to the victims of communal riots.

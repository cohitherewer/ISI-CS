The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Priyankas nose gives BJP a cold
                                                                                                               Priyankas nose gives BJP a cold

	New Delhi, April 24: If you think Priyanka Gandhi looks like Indira Gandhi, hold your tongue or the BJP will be angry.        
	Priyanka didnt bring the subject up at Rae Bareli yesterday; it was a reporter who did. Maybe its my nose, she had replied with a twinkle.        
	The BJP took it up on its own today, in keeping with its obsession with all things Nehru-Gandhi and appearing to betray a growing nervousness about Priyanka, who is not even a candidate.        
	Even as it did so, the BJP dubbed the matter trivial and accused the Congress of trying to divert the nations attention from burning issues.        
	What is this going on? a livid Ravi Shankar Prasad asked. (Whether) Priyanka looks like Indira or not cannot be a point of debate during the election.        
	BJP leaders responses to Rahul and Priyanka bear different tenors. While they dismiss Rahul as a kid who has to learn a lot in politics, they are not as patronising about Priyanka, who is widely seen to possess political acumen.        
	Many BJP leaders privately express frustration at what they see as the medias Priyanka-fixation. They ask why all the TV channels have permanently stationed an outside broadcast (OB) van and a reporter in Amethi and Rae Bareli to deliver a daily dose of Priyankaism.        
	Prasad said the election was not a family soap opera and the Congress should instead answer why food prices were rising. He did not explain how the BJP was working to that object by raising the subject of Priyanka.        
	The BJP, and the Sangh parivar in general, is known to respond to every single remark by Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi or Priyanka.        
	Recently, when Priyanka confronted Narendra Modi on his Budhiya (old woman) Congress rhetoric, he swiftly responded with a Guria (doll) Congress salvo.        
	BJP leaders also lapped up her comment that Rahul had the potential to become a good Prime Minister, and asked Manmohan Singh if he was listening.        
	Even today, the BJP spokesperson asked why Singh was not campaigning as actively as the Nehru-Gandhis, and repeated the charge that he was merely warming the top seat for Rahul.        
	The BJP, which fought the last general election on Sonias foreign origins, hasnt found enough opportunities to attack the family this time and has been forced to focus on attacking Singh. But the party is grabbing at whatever little chances come up to take a swipe at the Gandhi siblings.

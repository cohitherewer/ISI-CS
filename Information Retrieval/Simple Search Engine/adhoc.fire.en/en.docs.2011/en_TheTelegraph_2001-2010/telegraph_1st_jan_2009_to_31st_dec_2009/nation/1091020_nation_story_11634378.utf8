The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Battle to run St. Stephens reaches court
                                                                                                               Battle to run St. Stephens reaches court
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           St. Stephens College                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 19: The vice-principal of St. Stephens College has legally challenged the year-old appointment of principal Valson Thampu, exposing an ongoing tussle for control over the college.        
	Delhi High Court is tomorrow expected to hear a petition from vice-principal M.S. Frank, once considered close to Thampu, alleging that the principal illegally won the race to head the St. Stephens administration.         
	Frank has told the court that his challenge is based on RTI documents that suggest Thampu covered up certain facts while applying for the post of principal.         
	Sources close to Thampu dismissed the allegations and termed them Franks opportunism.         
	Franks allegations  that Thampu does not possess the academic qualifications required for a principal  are not new and were raised in 2007 when Thampu was the officiating head of the college.         
	But the vice-principal has used a fresh claim to bolster earlier charges against Thampu, arguing that the principal is not even qualified to teach at St. Stephens, leave alone to head the institution.         
	Delhi University norms require that a principal must teach at the college he heads.         
	But the minimum qualifications now required to teach at central universities include either holding an MPhil or PhD in the subject concerned, or success in the National Eligibility Test.         
	Thampu, who has earlier taught English at St. Stephens  when recruitment qualifications were different  does not hold an MPhil or PhD in English, and has not cleared the NET.         
	Thampus appointment had been challenged in 2007 because he did not hold a PhD is any subject at all at the time. The principal of a college must hold a PhD in a subject taught at the university to which the college is affiliated.         
	He subsequently earned a PhD in theology from the Allahabad Agricultural Institute, a deemed university.         
	But theology is not taught at DU and the relevance of Thampus PhD for the post of principal was questioned.         
	The UGC first questioned the adequacy of Thampus theology PhD for the post of principal but later indicated it was not opposed to his appointment as St. Stephens administrative head.         
	In his petition before the high court, Frank has also questioned the legitimacy of Thampus PhD  the Allahabad Agricultural Institute does not offer recognised undergraduate and post-graduate programmes in theology.         
	Frank has also cited a letter from the chairman of the college supreme council to the DU vice-chancellor earlier this year seeking clarifications on Thampus appointment.         
	Frank is arguing that the fact that the council  which appointed Thampu  itself harbours doubts about the legitimacy of the appointment needs to be investigated.         
	Sunil Matthews, legal counsel for the chairman of the supreme council, did not deny the existence of the letter but said he would articulate the councils position in the case only before the court.         
	But the latest controversy appears rooted in a debate on the role the Church of North India should play in the governance of the college.         
	The supreme council  that at present heads the college governance  recently signed a memorandum of understanding with the Church, allowing it greater influence over the college.         
	The Church, college insiders claim, has for the past several years attempted to increase its control over the college considered one of the best in the country.         
	Thampu himself was once backed by the Church when he battled allegations in 2007 that his appointment was illegal.         
	Frank, too, was believed to enjoy support of the Church, and supporters of Thampu allege he is being propped up by the Church to hurt Thampu.         
	But documents unearthed through the RTI Act suggest that Thampu was himself aware of the MoU allowing the Church a greater role in the college.

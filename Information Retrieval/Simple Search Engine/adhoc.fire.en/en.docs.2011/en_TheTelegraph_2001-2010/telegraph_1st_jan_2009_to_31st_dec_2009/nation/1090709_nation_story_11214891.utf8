The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Delhi lawyers slap judge 
                                                                                                               Delhi lawyers slap judge 
                            
	New Delhi, July 8 (PTI): A judge was allegedly slapped and manhandled by a group of lawyers at a district court today, sparking protests from the judicial officers association which demanded action against the culprits.        
	The Bar leaders denied the allegation, saying it was just a verbal duel between the lawyers and the judge.        
	The Delhi Judicial Officers Association said in a media release that the lawyers slapped additional district judge Pankaj Gupta who handles cases under the Hindu Marriage Act at the Rohini district courts.         
	 One lawyer started obstructing the judicial functioning when the judge was making an inquiry with regard to a fictitious petition filed before him. The judge called upon the lawyer not to interfere in his inquiry.        
	 The enraged lawyer went out and came back with a group of his colleagues. First, they abused the judge and then attempted to climb the dais. When the staff of the court tried to stop them, they thrashed the staff. They then slapped the judge and asked him to stand by the wall and again slapped and beat him, the association said.        
	 B.S. Rana, the chairperson of the Bar Council of Delhi, denied the charge. According to my information, the judge was not assaulted. It was merely a verbal altercation.

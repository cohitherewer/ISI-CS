          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 16: The Orissa government has appealed to doctors in the state not to go ahead with their ceasework from Friday.        
	The appeal by the health and family welfare department was issued after the doctors under the banner of the Orissa Medical Service Association (OMSA) threatened to submit mass resignation.        
	Over 2,500 government doctors under the OMSA have decided to cease work if the government did not respond positively to their demands. On November 3 last year, at least 2,470 doctors submitted their resignation. The association will presume that the government does not require our services any more and that our mass resignation letters submitted earlier have been accepted if our demands are not met, said OMSA president Madhusudan Mishra.        
	The doctors have of late been demanding the implementation of the Dynamic Assured Career Progression (DACP) for them. The government maintained that it had already fulfilled most of the demands and that DACP was never there in the charter of demands submitted earlier.        
	The provision of DACP was made in the 6th Pay Commission report. The government has declared the post of government doctors at the entry level as junior Class I. It increased their specialist allowance from Rs 150 to Rs 3,000 per month. We also pay them post-mortem allowances and recruit doctors to fill up vacant posts, said health minister Prasanna Acharya.                    
	We are holding talks with the OMSA officials and examining their demands. We hope the problem will be resolved, said Acharya.        
	The OMSA members will hold a general body meeting tomorrow to take a final decision on whether to go ahead with the strike or honour the governments appeal.

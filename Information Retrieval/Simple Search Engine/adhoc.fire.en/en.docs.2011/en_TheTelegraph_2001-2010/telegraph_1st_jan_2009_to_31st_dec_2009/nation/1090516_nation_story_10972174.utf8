	New Delhi, May 15: L.K. Advani waited five years for this battle, defied age to fight like a young soldier and hasnt given up despite discouraging predictions.        
	The 82-year-old in the race for Prime Minister is hopeful his long wait will finally be over. A close aide summed up his mood thus: He is relaxed, meeting leaders, taking down notes and enquiring if there is any doubt about the BJP emerging the single largest party. He was told the party could get up to 178 seats and that made him happier.        
	Advani has no regrets as he thinks the election was fought in the best possible manner and is prepared to accept the verdict.         
	Aides insist he is showing cautious optimism but no desperation, no dismay. He met some key party leaders this morning, before they went to their states for counting, as well as NDA partners like Om Prakash Chautala and Ajit Singh. Then, he called in-house pollster G.V.L. Narasimha Rao for a reassuring word.         
	In the evening, Advani went to the BJP war room on 26 Tughlaq Crescent and had tea with the team. Venkaiah Naidu and Najma Heptullah joined him, as did key aide Sudheendra Kulkarni, daughter Pratibha and son Jayant. BJP president Rajnath Singh wasnt present, having driven to Ghaziabad to gather the final inputs about his own prospects as a candidate from there.        
	Sources said Advanis wife Kamala had planned a film show and a dinner for close friends but couldnt confirm if the event was on.        
	Advani has assigned the task of contacting potential partners to some senior leaders. The leadership isnt worried about existing allies, not even Nitish Kumar, who said today he would support any party or alliance that accorded Bihar special status.         
	BJP spokesperson Prakash Javadekar suggested Nitish was only raising something Advani had already promised. Advani had promised special status for Bihar at a rally in Buxar on April 10.         
	A top Advani aide said: We are committed to making Advani Prime Minister and will sit in the Opposition if that does not materialise.

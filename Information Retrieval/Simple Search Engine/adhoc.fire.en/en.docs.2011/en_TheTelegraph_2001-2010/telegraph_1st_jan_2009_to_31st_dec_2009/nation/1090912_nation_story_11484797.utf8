	 Mumbai, Sept. 11 (PTI): Ajmal Kasab was today reprimanded by special judge M.L. Tahalyani, who is hearing the Mumbai attacks case, after the suspect was found talking to a co-accused in the dock.           
	Kya baat kar rahe ho? the judge asked Kasab after special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam complained the gunman was talking to Faheem Ansari. Kasab got up and said: kuch nahin huzur (nothing, sir).                   
	 Aligarh (PTI): The Aligarh Muslim University Teachers Association has threatened to go on strike if the suspension of a senior faculty member was not revoked. Tariq Islam, a senior reader in the philosophy department, was suspended last month for having allegedly tampered with his marksheet while submitting his job application over 20 years ago.                  
	 Srinagar: Jammu and Kashmir High Court on Friday granted bail to four police officers accused of destroying evidence in the Shopian rape and murder case. The decision triggered protests and led to a shutdown in Shopian with people demanding action against the four. The organisation spearheading an agitation has called for a Kashmir bandh on Saturday to protest the governments alleged inaction in implicating the four.          
	A special investigation team probing the case had on July 15 arrested the then Shopian police chief Javid Iqbal Matoo, his deputy Rohit Baskotra, and two other police officers. They have been asked not to leave the state without the permission of the Shopian sessions judge.                  
	 Varanasi (PTI): Unidentified bikers shot dead a doctor and stole his motorbike and cellphone on Thursday night in Azamgarh district of Uttar Pradesh. The body of the 25-year-old doctor, Ram Saharey Yadav, was spotted by villagers. Yadav could have been murdered because of a dispute over his clinic, police said.                   
	 Gonda (PTI): A special court has sentenced a man to life imprisonment for raping a Dalit girl in a village in Gonda, Uttar Pradesh.

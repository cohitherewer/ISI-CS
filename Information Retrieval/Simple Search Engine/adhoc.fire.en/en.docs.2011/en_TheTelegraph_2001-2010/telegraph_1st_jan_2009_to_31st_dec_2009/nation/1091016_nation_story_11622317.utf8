The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sanghs takeover blueprint in a pickle
                                                                                                               Sanghs takeover blueprint in a pickle
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                            Parrikar, Gadkari                          
	New Delhi, Oct. 15: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sanghs plans to take over the BJP and revamp it along a Sangh blueprint appear to be faltering even before take-off.        
	Two of the younger regional leaders the Sangh had in mind as possible successors to Rajnath Singh have seen their chances weaken, one through a gaffe and the other because of political circumstances.        
	Former Goa chief minister Manohar Parrikar, the front runner a month ago, made the mistake of jumping the gun. In a TV interview, he tangentially likened L.K. Advani to rancid pickle and suggested he should quit before being dumped.        
	The other candidate, Nitin Gadkari, finds his future tied to the Shiv Sena-BJPs showing in the Maharashtra polls.        
	Sangh sources said that although sarsanghachalak Mohanrao Bhagwat was against promoting anyone from the Delhi elite club that includes Sushma Swaraj and M. Venkaiah Naidu, it now appears he might have to pick one of them.        
	The Sanghs reservations were that if one of them took over the party, Advaniji would continue to rule by proxy. Now it looks as though the Sanghs options are getting limited. Moreover, the leaders have reconciled themselves to the idea that Advaniji will have a major say in the process (of succession), a source said.        
	When Parrikars interview was telecast in September, there was suspicion that the usually reticent and low-key politician had been put up to it by the Sangh. But sources have quashed the suggestion.        
	They said Parrikar had got carried away over the reports of being a front runner and tried to ingratiate himself with the parent organisation by running down Advani.        
	The RSS wants Advaniji to exit gracefully and wants his legacy insulated against controversies. The leaders did not like Parrikars remarks. The prospective president of a national party should not compromise his stature with casual and ill-thought-out comments on a senior, a source said.        
	Gadkari, the leader of the BJP in the Maharashtra legislative council, has several weaknesses. He has never become a pan-Maharashtra leader in his long years in the party and also heads a faction that was first opposed to Pramod Mahajan and, after he died, to his brother-in-law Gopinath Munde.        
	Sources said Gadkaris prospects depended on the state polls ---- a BJP-Sena win would boost his candidature, a defeat would hurt his chances.        
	The sources said the possibility of selecting a party president from among the chief ministers appeared remote. None of those the Sangh had in mind ---- Narendra Modi (a distant possibility to start with), Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Raman Singh ----- wanted to leave their states to do a thankless job in Delhi.        
	Bhagwat, however, still seems intent on a young BJP chief, a stand that puts paid to the ambitions of former pracharaks like Bal Apte, who is in his 70s.        
	To underscore the message, the Sangh chief has overhauled his organisations steel frame, bringing people aged 20 and 40 into the posts of district pracharaks, department pracharaks and state pracharaks.        
	A BJP official, however, argued that for a political party that panders to various constituencies, just being young and presentable is not good enough.        
	We have to look at caste, region and community; and the ability to network, to be accessible to the cadres and to have ones ears to the ground, he said.        
	Sources said that after the take-over buzz, the only substantive intervention by the RSS had been securing the removal of Satyabrata (Julu) Mukherjee as Bengal BJP president. They said his only crime was to have issued a show-cause notice to the RSS-appointed organising secretary.

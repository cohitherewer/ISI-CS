The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Varun knocks on SC door
                                                                                                               Varun knocks on SC door
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bajrang Dal activists protest in Hubli against imposition of the National Security Act on Varun Gandhi. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, April 1: Varun Gandhi today challenged his detention under the National Security Act in the Supreme Court, claiming it was politically motivated.        
	The petition, filed by his aunt Ambika Shukla, contended that Varun was being targeted because of his political heritage  an allusion to his famous surname  and that the detention order was intended to sabotage his electoral debut.        
	The petition will be heard tomorrow.        
	The order is bad in law and has been passed with political motivation the entire attempt is a combined effort of (the Mayavati government, district authorities) to ensure he is not able to contest and campaign for the general election the petition said.        
	The order would not only deprive him of his liberty but also have the effect of virtually prohibiting him from contesting and campaigning.        
	The petition said Varun, who was shifted to Etah jail from Pilibhit last night, feared for his life in custody and urged the court to quash the detention order and set him free. It is not ascertainable as to the period of preventive detention ordered and this itself is fatal, the petition said.        
	The right of contesting the elections is the bulwark in a democracy and for petty reasons (such as allegedly making inflammatory statements and causing breach of public order as specified in the detention order), the right of the detenu cannot be infringed.        
	The order was in violation of Articles 14 (right to equality), 19 (right to freedom) and 21 (right to life) of the Constitution, the petition said.        
	It claimed Varun was a law-abiding citizen who had surrendered before the authorities over the trumped-up charges of creating communal disharmony.        
	The March 29 detention order had been passed knowingly fully well that Varun would be released on bail the next day by the courts, the petition alleged.        
	It is obvious that the prevention order is to overcome the grant of bail.        
	The petition said Varun could not be held responsible for clashes between his supporters and police in Pilibhit on the day of his surrender in connection with criminal cases lodged over his alleged anti-Muslim speeches.        
	Such acts, even if they did occur, cannot be attributed to any encouragement or provocation of the part of the petitioner as he was already in the custody of the police.        
	The petition claimed a 29-year-old could not be expected to direct the crowd not to follow him. In any event, having promulgated Section 144 CrPC, the authorities have hopelessly failed in their duties.        
	The petitioner/detenu is being targeted by the respondent No 1 (Mayavati govt) due to his political heritage, stature, affiliations and is arbitrarily being held responsible for a failure and collapse of due administration.        
	The detention order did not mention any breach of public order or threat to the nations security and should be quashed, the petition claimed.        
	The petitioner fears for his personal safety while in jail as a conspiracy to assassinate him has come to light it said.

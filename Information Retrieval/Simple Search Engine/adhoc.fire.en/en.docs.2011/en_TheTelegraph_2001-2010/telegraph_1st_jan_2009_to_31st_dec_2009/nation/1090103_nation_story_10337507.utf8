                                                                                                               BJP ducks Sangh sermon 
  - Stress on winnability, not ideology        SANJAY K. JHA                          Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi with BSF officers near the border in Kutch on Thursday. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, Jan. 2: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh today asked the BJP to stick to its core ideology in its Lok Sabha poll campaign, but was told this was impossible in the age of coalitions.        
	At a meeting between the two organisations heavyweights, BJP leaders expressed broad agreement with the Sanghs arguments about the challenges ahead, but explained the importance of being pragmatic in politics.        
	Sources said senior party leaders, especially backers of L.K. Advanis moderate line, offered two arguments why the BJP could not be rigid about ideology.        
	One, coalition politics did not allow any party to solely follow its own agenda; and two, it was impossible to expand the partys base without reaching out beyond the core Hindutva constituency. The BJP leaders stressed the need to widen the partys appeal among the urban middle class, professionals and the youth.        
	The sources said the BJP leaders tried to reason with the Sangh brass that the National Democratic Alliance needed to present itself as a viable national alternative to the United Progressive Alliance.        
	Even the Sangh demand that party candidates be selected on the basis of their ideological commitment met with resistance: the BJP preferred winnability.        
	Both sides, however, agreed on the need for better co-ordination among Sangh parivar outfits. Many believe that the BJP lost the Rajasthan polls because of conflict between its then chief minister, Vasundhara Raje, and the Sangh.        
	The Sangh asked the BJP to be more accommodating of its demands and to set up better mechanisms to ensure harmony. It suggested that certain points be included in the BJP poll manifesto.        
	Mohan Bhagwat, Madan Das Devi and Suresh Soni represented the Sangh at the meeting, attended by BJP leaders such as Advani, Rajnath Singh, Arun Jaitley, Venkaiah Naidu, Murli Manohar Joshi, Sushma Swaraj, Ananth Kumar and Ram Lal.        
	Earlier in the day, the BJP parliamentary board, the partys highest decision-making body, decided that most of the candidates for the general election would be finalised by January-end. The BJP, of course, doesnt yet know how many candidates it would be fielding since it must leave seats for its NDA partners  and some alliances are yet to be firmed up. But the party will choose the candidates for the seats it is sure to contest when its central election committee meets on January 18-19 and 28-29.

	New Delhi, Feb. 22: The CPI today said it would contest 50 seats across the country in the coming general election and released its first list of 33 candidates.        
	Candidates for three seats in Bengal were not announced as the Left Front decides the matter collectively.        
	In all, we are contesting in 50 seats. We have identified 41 constituencies and candidates for 33 already. The second list will be announced within a week, CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan said after a two-day meeting of the partys national executive. He said the Bengal candidates could be named by March 2 or 3.        
	The lists for Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh would be announced later as seat-sharing talks were on, Bardhan said.         
	The manifesto committee of the party, under D. Raja and Shameem Faizee, was in place, and negotiations were on with other Left parties and third front allies regarding certain seats, he added.        
	The CPM had said it would contest 80 seats in total. The candidates and seats will be finalised at the central committee meeting next month.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Indian doctor gets jail amp; escape hatch
                                                                                                               Indian doctor gets jail amp; escape hatch
          AMIT ROY                          Ramnath: Lucky                                  
	London, Feb. 6: An Indian doctor, who was forced to return to the UK from America to face the charge of killing a patient, was given a six-month jail sentence today after being found guilty of manslaughter.         
	But Priya Ramnath, a 40-year-old mother of two, can count herself lucky  a sympathetic judge at Birmingham Crown Court suspended the sentence for two years.         
	This means that providing Ramnath commits no other offence for two years, she will not have to go to prison. Nor is it certain she will not practise as a doctor again.         
	In a statement, the family of Patricia Leighton, who died, aged 51, in 1998 after she was injected with adrenaline after Ramnath had ignored the advice of her senior colleagues, appeared to suggest the doctor would not work again.         
	The dead womans daughters, Debbie Leighton-Newton and Nicky Fellows, who have been present throughout the four-week trial, said in their joint statement: We are happy that the jury have returned a guilty verdict and that justice has at last been served, and hope that she will never be able to wreck another familys life.        
	 According to the General Medical Council, which decides on a doctors fitness to practise, she is not automatically debarred. A spokesperson told The Telegraph: Dr Ramnath is no longer on the register here in the UK, so there is no action we have to take.        
	The court was told Leighton died of heart failure shortly after being given adrenaline by Ramnath at Stafford District General Hospital. Ramnath resigned as registrar six days after Leightons death on July 22, flew to America and found work and started a new life in Texas.         
	The initial inquest into the patients death found she died of natural causes. But a second inquest, in August 2004, resulted in a verdict of unlawful killing.         
	After the 10-2 guilty verdict by a jury today, the judge ruled that the interests of justice did not require her to take away Ramnaths liberty.

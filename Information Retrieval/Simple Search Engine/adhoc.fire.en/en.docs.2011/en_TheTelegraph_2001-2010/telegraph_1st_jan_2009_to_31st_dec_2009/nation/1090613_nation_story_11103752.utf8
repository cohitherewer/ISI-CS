	Patna, Jun 12 (PTI): Acting chief judicial magistrate of Patna court Shailendra Kumar today issued an arrest warrant and a proclamation notice against former Bihar minister and JD(U) leader Vijay Krishan and son Chanakya in connection with the Satyendra Singh murder case.         
	While hearing a police petition, the judge ordered for the warrant and notice, and said that a notice for the attachment of the property would be issued also after execution of the proclamation notice.         
	Earlier, police told the court that Satyendras body was found near Gulli ghat in the Ganges and bloodstains were spotted on the scene.         
	Satyendra, a resident of Kankarbagh locality (Patna), was kidnapped two weeks ago.        
	Police had sought services of navy divers to search for the body. On the basis of the statement of some of the accused, the needle of suspicion was pointed at former Bihar minister Vijay Krishna and son. Satyendra had accompanied Krishna on May 23 from his residence to Guinea Motors on Boring Canal Road and had been missing since then.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 12: American Lashkar-e-Toiba operative David Coleman Headley lived conspicuously on his recce trips to in India, staying at private homes, playing squash at clubs and making friends, sources said.        
	The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has formed a task force to retrace the movements of the Pakistan-born Headley and his friend Tahawwur Hussain Rana, who apparently visited cities such as Mumbai, Lucknow, Ahmedabad, Pune, Agra and Cochin.        
	Both were arrested in October in Chicago by the US investigative agency FBI for allegedly plotting 26/11-style attacks in India at Lashkars behest.        
	India is trying to link the duo to the Mumbai attacks last November, which could make their extradition easier.        
	An Indian intelligence team returned from Washington this week after talks with the FBI and handed a report to the home ministry. The team will visit America again when US authorities grant permission to interrogate Headley and Rana.        
	Yesterday, the NIA registered a case, number 4/2009, against Headley, Rana and others, home minister P. Chidambaram said today.        
	He added that the duo had travelled to India before and after the 26/11 attacks. Headley made at least nine visits to India. Other than planning attacks in India, they apparently plotted to send moles to the US to form Lashkar sleeper cells.        
	Headley apparently masqueraded as a businessman who wanted to set up a visa facilitation agency in India. He lived in private homes, with relatives of acquaintances in the US or India, avoiding leaving behind a trail of stays in hotels, a top home ministry source said.        
	He had the gift of the gab and some people who knew him told investigators he was a great guy.        
	Sources said Headley and Rana visited Pune, the headquarters of the armys Southern Command, and Cochin, a naval base. Investigative teams have fanned out across the country to trace the duos footsteps.        
	Before his arrest, Headley meant to travel to Pakistan to meet terror handlers, including the fugitive Ilyas Kashmiri, sources said.        
	Visa curbs        
	Following Headleys arrest, India has tightened visa approval norms for Pakistan-born US citizens by making a home ministry clearance mandatory. It is also mulling similar action on US nationals born in China, Afghanistan and Iran, officials said.

	New Delhi, Sept. 16: The axe of austerity has fallen on sports too.        
	The latest victim of the cost-cut drive, which has suddenly unravelled to ministers and politicians the virtues of flying economy class, is A.R. Rahman. The Oscar winners one year to go musical show at India Gate on October 3 has been cancelled by the Commonwealth Games Organising committee.        
	We are cancelling the show as part of the austerity measures that we have decided to undertake. This was decided by the organising committee itself and we havent received any notification about this from the Government of India, organising committee chairman Suresh Kalmadi said today.        
	The show was expected to be a huge draw with the maestro belting out his hits to an audience sources said could have numbered close to 20,000. The organisers were also planning to cash in on the stars appeal to generate excitement about the 2010 Games from October 3-14, the first mega sporting event of its kind in 28 years since India hosted the 1982 Asiad.        
	At the last Games in 2006, Melbourne hosted some of the most innovative artistes and performers from across the Commonwealth. A big hit was The Festival Melbourne 2006, which cost $13 million to stage but attracted about a million people.        
	China, too, pulled out all stops to make last years Olympics one of the most spectacular sporting events in Asia.        
	Kalmadi, however, doesnt seem to believe in frills, though the Rahman show would have cost the Commonwealth Games exchequer Rs 10 crore, peanuts compared to the Games budget of Rs 2,264 crore.        
	Moreover, insiders say, advertisements and television rights would have earned the organising committee big bucks as revenue.        
	This isnt all.         
	Kalmadi has also done away with the cultural show at Trafalgar Square after the Queens Baton Relay ceremony at Buckingham Palace in London on October 29 that will mark the start of the journey of the Games to Delhi  a 1.75-lakh kilometre trek through 70 countries.        
	The Queens Baton Relay will start from Buckingham Palace in the presence of Indias President Pratibha Patil. There will be no cultural event after the handing over of the baton. We have decided to cut down costs on all frills. We are also going to travel by economy class, Kalmadi said.                    Kalmadi at a news conference in Delhi on Wednesday. Ramakant Kushwaha      
	Earlier, it had been planned that after the Queen handed over the baton to star shooter Abhinav Bindra, there would be a grand opening ceremony at Buckingham Palace. But that, as they say, is now history.        
	It is estimated that the handover ceremony will be watched by an estimated two billion people on television across the globe.        
	All these events should come out of the funds the CWG will generate. I dont see why this is happening. Austerity might just be an excuse, I am sure they have their reasons. We have to meet the standards set by the other countries that have organised the Games before. It will show India in a bad light, said K.P.S. Gill, who headed the Indian Hockey Federation.        
	Also, its wrong to speak suddenly about austerity when one has already taken on a big event such as the Commonwealth Games. Standards should not and cannot be compromised, the former top cop added.

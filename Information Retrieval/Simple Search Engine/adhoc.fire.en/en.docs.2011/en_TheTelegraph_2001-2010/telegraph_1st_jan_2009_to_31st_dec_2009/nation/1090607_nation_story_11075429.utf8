The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Think twice before death award: SC
                                                                                                               Think twice before death award: SC
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 6: The Supreme Court has asked judges to think twice before awarding the death sentence and virtually questioned the need and justification for the provision in a maturing society.        
	A two-judge bench, while admitting the Constitution did not allow it to take a re-look at the capital punishment policy, called for a wider debate on whether the measure should be retained. In the meantime, it asked judges to make death sentences the exception and life terms the rule.        
	Justices S.B. Sinha and Cyriac Joseph cautioned their colleagues not to be swayed by public opinion, which was overwhelmingly in favour of capital punishment. They cited how public opinion had run counter to law in the 26/11 case, with prospective defence counsel coming under physical attack.        
	Judges have a duty to take a perspective on individual rights at a higher pedestal than majoritarian aspirations, the court said. To that extent we play a counter-majoritarian role.        
	The court questioned the theory that fear of the death sentence is the strongest deterrent for would-be criminals, saying the evidence was not strong enough to justify the extreme measure. The way to reduce crime was through better policing and prosecution.        
	The judges cited the move away from the death penalty in many countries and said: We should strive to tune (our) practice to the evolving standards of a maturing society.        
	Death is not just the severest of punishments but also qualitatively different from any other because of its total irrevocability.        
	A jail term can serve several ends of the legal system, the court said. It deters potential criminals, prevents the convict from carrying out further crimes and makes the convicts rehabilitation and retribution possible.        
	But the death penalty is unique in its absolute rejection of the potential of (the) convict to rehabilitate and reform.        
	The court made these observations as it commuted the death sentence awarded to a jobless young man from Pune who had kidnapped and killed a rich friend during a botched bid for ransom in August 2001.        
	Santosh Kumar Satishbhushan Bariyar and three accomplices had strangled the victim with a rope and then beheaded him with a hacksaw and a sickle. They then chopped his arms and legs, put them in separate polythene and rexin bags, used an antiseptic solution to kill the stench and dumped the bags in different places.        
	The killers had always meant to kill the hostage, because he could have identified Bariyar. The four were arrested while trying to pick up the ransom of Rs 10 lakh.        
	The apex court bench, however, said there was nothing to show that Bariyar could not be reformed.        
	It conceded that the way the body was disposed of was abhorrent and made the crime a most foul and despicable one. Still, it said, the mere mode of disposal of the body did not by itself put the murder in the rarest of rare category  a criterion often cited to justify the award of the death sentence.        
	They were not professional killers. They have no criminal history. All were unemployed and were searching for jobs, the court said.

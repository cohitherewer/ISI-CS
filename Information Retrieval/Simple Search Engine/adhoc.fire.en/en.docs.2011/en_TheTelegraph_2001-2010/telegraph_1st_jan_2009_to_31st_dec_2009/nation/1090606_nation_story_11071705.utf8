The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Singh sets off Sangma buzz

	New Delhi, June 5: A word used by the Prime Minister when he greeted Purno A. Sangma in Parliament set off a buzz today.        
	As Manmohan Singh bumped into Sangma in Central Hall, he invited the Nationalist Congress Party leader to join the mainstream. A stunned Sangma replied: I will consider.        
	Some conjectured that mainstream meant the Congress. But few really believed that Singh could have meant this, given the troubled history between Sangma and Sonia Gandhi, though the strain in their relationship seems to have eased recently. It would also be unlike Singh to openly court a key leader from the party of one of his senior ministers, Sharad Pawar.        
	Still, the supposed overture gave keen pleasure to Congress members from Maharashtra. With the Congress outshining the NCP in Maharashtra in the Lok Sabha polls, these leaders have been pressing the high command to dump the ally before the October Assembly polls.        
	Whatever signals they read in Singhs remark, Congress sources sounded dismissive of Sangma. We dont need him; hes a single-seat leader from a small state, a source said.        
	Some, however, suggested Singhs comment was entirely innocuous  he was merely expressing goodwill in general terms.        
	Sangmas relations with the Congress and Sonia have improved after his daughter Agatha was inducted into the ministry on Pawars request.        
	In 1999, Sangma had been expelled from the Congress along with Pawar and Bihar leader Tariq Anwar for raising Sonias foreign origin. But on the day of Agathas swearing-in, father and daughter went up to Sonia and Rahul Gandhi and greeted them. Sonia patted Agatha on the shoulder.        
	Last Sunday, Sangma called at 10 Janpath to invite Sonia to his son Conrads wedding reception. Sources said he apologised to her and Sonia was extremely gracious.        
	Still, some in the NCP would be worried by Singhs remark. Union ministers Vilasrao Deshmukh and Prithviraj Chavan have been arguing that since both the issues that prompted Pawar to part ways with the Congress  Sonias foreign origin and his own ambition of becoming Prime Minister  were now dead, the NCP had lost its relevance and should merge with the Congress.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP wobbly in Raje fief
                                                                                                               BJP wobbly in Raje fief
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI IN JHALAWAR                          THE CHALLENGER AND THE INCUMBENT: Hoardings of Congress nominee Urmila Jain (left) and BJP MP Dushyant Singh                                  
	Dhanraj Rathor claims he was the first farmer in Khanpur village in this district to garland Vasundhara Raje Scindia when the then chief minister visited in 2004 to seek votes for her son Dushyant.         
	She was like a badi behen (elder sister) to all of us and I was excited to meet her, he recalled.         
	But five years later, the 52-year-old wheat farmer harbours grouses against most local BJP leaders, who he accuses of accepting bribes from local dons to allow a spurious drug trade to flourish.         
	Rathor lost his own wife allegedly to the substandard drugs last year, and today, it is not Vasundhara he refers to when he talks of an elder sister.         
	Congress ki Urmila Jain Bhaya ab yahan ke logon ki badi behen ki tarah ubhar rahi hain (Congress nominee Urmila Jain Bhaya is emerging as the elder sister of the people of this region), said Rathor, squatting in his dimly lit home.         
	Two decades after Vasundhara, easily the BJPs most charismatic leader in this state, first won a Lok Sabha election here, her family fief is under the most serious threat it has since witnessed.         
	Cracks are opening up in the fortress she has carefully built and nurtured, and a perceived Congress wave sweeping through much of the state is threatening to breach it this general election.         
	Jhalawar is one of only two seats in Rajasthan that the BJP has won continuously since 1989, when the party first won any seat in the state.         
	Vasundhara bagged the Jhalawar seat five times  1989, 1991, 1996, 1998 and 1999  winning an absolute majority (over 50 per cent votes) on four occasions. In 1996, she won after garnering 49.89 per cent votes.         
	In 2004, when as chief minister she handed the seat over to Dushyant, the son duly registered a comfortable win in the family bastion  he won 53.53 per cent votes.         
	But 2009 is proving a much tougher challenge for 38-year-old Dushyant.         
	Most of Jhalawar district has been combined with Baran district to form a new constituency Jhalawar-Baran. (The two districts in the states south-east jut out from the main body of Rajasthan into Madhya Pradesh.)         
	Both Jhalawar and Baran have four Assembly segments and neither returned a favourable verdict for the BJP in the state elections last December.         
	The Congress swept all four seats in Baran and shared Jhalawar equally with the BJP, leaving the saffron party staring at a 6-2 adverse verdict here.         
	The BJP is arguing that the Assembly results were a consequence of poor allocation of tickets.         
	People were unhappy with our MLAs and with those to whom tickets were allocated. There is no sentiment against Dushyant or madam (Vasundhara), said Srikishan Patidas, the BJP district chief for Jhalawar.         
	Indeed, even Rathor said he held no grouse specifically against Vasundhara or her son. Elsewhere, in Jhalawar town, and in villages like Khanpur, too, the common refrain is that the mother-son duo are unaware of the crimes their minions are committing.         
	Roads in Jhalawar district were no more than mud-tracks before Vasundhara took over as chief minister in 2003, say locals.         
	Today, the smooth two-lane highway connecting Jhalawar town to villages like Khanpur could be a Formula One race track with extra chicanes, except for the occasional buffalo that trespasses on to the road.         
	But the BJP will have to bear the consequences of those crimes, said Rathor.         
	To mitigate the effects of the consequences, Dushyant and his party machinery are working extra hard, especially in the Assembly segments where the BJP was thrashed in December.         
	But a sense of panic is palpable in the BJP.         
	Today, Dushyant was to address a series of sabhas in Jhalawar district, travelling by car.         
	The plan was finalised, and villages where he would be stopping, were asked to prepare. Then late yesterday, Dushyant and some leaders decided to scrap this plan and instead go by chopper to villages in Baran.         
	This kind of chaotic planning is uncharacteristic for our party. I guess there is more nervousness than ever in the past two decades that we may lose this seat, admitted a veteran BJP leader here, ailing and unable to campaign this time.         
	Among Congress leaders on the other hand, there is clear excitement. Urmila Jain Bhaya, an MLA from Baran district, is popular even in Jhalawar for organising mass weddings for the poor.         
	There is a feeling we may see something special. Defeating Vasundharas family here is akin to defeating the Gandhi family in Amethi. And there is a real chance this time, a senior Congress leader said.         
	Vasundhara is known to be bruising over the defeat of her state government, brought about in part by critics within the party who worked against her.         
	A defeat in her own fief for her son at this stage could leave the maharani without any empire to defend.

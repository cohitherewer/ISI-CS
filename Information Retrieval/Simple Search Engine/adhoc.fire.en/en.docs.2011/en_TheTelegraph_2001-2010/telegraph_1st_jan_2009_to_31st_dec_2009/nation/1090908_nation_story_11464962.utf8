The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sonia shows whos the boss
                                                                                                               Sonia shows whos the boss
          SANJAY K. JHA                                    
	New Delhi, Sept. 7: The deft handling of the frenzied campaign to hoist YSRs son Jaganmohan Reddy as Andhra Pradesh chief minister has reinforced the importance of a strong high command in the Congress.        
	A surrender in this hour of emotional crisis would not only have weakened the central leadership but legitimised the practice of dynastic succession in the party.        
	Sonia Gandhi showed a rare mix of sensitivity and firmness as she countered the unprecedented push for Jaganmohan, which bordered on political blackmail, by the majority of the states legislators.        
	She made an emphatic statement of support for the family by visiting Hyderabad with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, son Rahul Gandhi and a host of senior leaders. But she did not hesitate to send out, through Digvijay Singh, the tough message that the high command could not be compelled to take decisions under pressure.        
	Party leaders feel a very difficult job was handled with exemplary political maturity, especially as even a minor mistake by the high command could have triggered violent protests in Andhra and the political situation could have gone out of control.        
	While clearly showing that the central leadership was not being insensitive to local sentiments and that the interests of the Reddy family would be fully protected, the party convinced the MLAs that making Jaganmohan, a greenhorn, the chief minister of a big state wasnt the best option.        
	The Congress high commands success has come at a time the BJPs central leadership is in disarray. The BJP brass, torn between L.K. Advani and Rajnath Singh, has had to face embarrassment several times in the recent past  like being forced to undertake a referendum to choose the leader in Bihar, yield to Gopinath Mundes blackmail, digest Vasundhara Rajes defiance and ignore rebellion by senior leaders.        
	The Congress has often operated with a strong centre but this balance was disturbed when the party was out of power for a while. Party president Sonia was struggling to establish her authority, and the states had powerful chief ministers in Digvijay Singh, A.K. Antony, Ajit Jogi, Amarinder Singh, Vilasrao Deshmukh, Sheila Dikshit, Ashok Gehlot, S.M. Krishna and Vir Bhadra Singh.        
	The equations changed with the Congress returning to power at the Centre in 2004 and most of these regional satraps losing the elections in their states. Sonia emerged stronger in 2009 with the phenomenal rise of Rahul, and now is in total control of the party.        
	There is neither any chief minister nor any central leader who can defy her, restoring complete discipline and unity in the party.        
	Powerful regional dissenters like K. Karunakaran, J.B. Patnaik and Narayan Rane have fallen in line, and even state unit presidents do not have the political wherewithal to question her decisions. With the death of Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, the culture of strong regional leaders has come to an end in the Congress.        
	The most striking sign of the diminishing power of the regional leaders is the new trend of appointing working presidents to curtail the clout of most state Congress presidents.

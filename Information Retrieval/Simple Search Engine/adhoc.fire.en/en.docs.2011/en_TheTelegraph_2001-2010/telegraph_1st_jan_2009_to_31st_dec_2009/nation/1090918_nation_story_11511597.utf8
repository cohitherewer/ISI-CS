	According to the proposal, suggested by home minister P. Chidambaram, the extra 100 days will be available even if the present 100-day limit has been exhausted. Around 4.6 lakh people have got 100 days of work so far under the scheme.         
	Most of the beneficiaries are said to be from the 234 districts  out of the countrys total of 626  that have been declared drought-hit.

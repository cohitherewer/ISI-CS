The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bengal fuel worry
                                                                                                               Bengal fuel worry
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Jan. 7: Bengal today stared at the prospect of a fuel shortage within 48 hours as officers of 13 oil companies went on an indefinite nationwide strike, disrupting gas and crude production.        
	Several states invoked the Essential Services Maintenance Act, leading to the arrest in Delhi of Narendra Goyal, an official of the Oil Sector Officers Association that has gone on strike in defiance of court orders.         
	Delhi police also arrested two members of the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Officers Union under Esma.        
	On public life, the impact of the strike is nil as of now. Oil companies have enough stock to meet demand for 15-20 days. Supplies of jet fuel, petrol and diesel were normal, petroleum secretary R.S. Pandey said in New Delhi.        
	But in Bengal, Indian Oil Corporation officials warned petrol pumps would run dry, LPG supplies would be hit and flights affected if the strike was not called off in two days.        
	Since no oil was delivered today, pumps will start running dry from tomorrow evening. Assuming there will be some panic buying, pumps may run dry even faster, an IOC official said.        
	Dealers predicted a crisis in 48 hours after work at Indian Oil and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited remained at a standstill.         
	Indian Oil officials said the Haldia refinery, which supplies BPCL and IBP, did not work today. Ten other oil depots also struck work. The officials did not see hope in Hindustan Petroleum not joining the strike, saying it too drew supplies from the Haldia refinery.        
	There are nearly 2,000 petrol pumps across Bengal. If the strike goes on for a few days, then we will face a problem. We expect the pumps to dry up from Friday onwards, said Joydeb Sarkar, general secretary of West Bengal Petroleum Dealers Association.        
	Even if a petrol pump has stocks today, they will hardly last as in every such case when supply has been affected in the past, there has been panic purchase. We are helpless, Sarkar added.        
	Some flights from Calcutta were delayed because of late arrival of fuel tankers. Five flights each of Jet Airways and Air India were held up.

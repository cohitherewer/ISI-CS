The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Clawback on Advani radar
                                                                                                               Clawback on Advani radar
          SANJAY K. JHA                           Advani                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 9: A stormy Parliament session after the UPAs emphatic election victory appears to have lifted Opposition leader L.K. Advani out of his poll blues.         
	Party leaders say he has been greatly emboldened by the turn of events during the budget session and is willing to fight to regain his supremacy over the party organisation.         
	Advanis bold assertions about his continuance as leader of the Opposition and the undesirability of a post-mortem on the BJPs election debacle at the chintan baithak on August 20 are being viewed as significant indicators of the change in his attitude.         
	Advani feels Arun Jaitley in the Rajya Sabha and Sushma Swaraj in the Lok Sabha have done an excellent job under his guidance and there is no point in returning to the mire of the election defeat and its causes. He has already decided not to take any known dissenter to the chintan baithak, which will focus entirely on future strategies.         
	Only party general secretaries, parliamentary board members, chief ministers, deputy chief ministers and the leaders and deputy leaders of the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha are being invited to the meet.         
	The participants will include Rajnath Singh, Sushma, Jaitley, Venkaiah Naidu, Jaswant Singh, Murli Manohar Joshi, Ananth Kumar, Bal Apte, Ram Lal, Thavarchand Gehlot, Vinay Katiyar, Vijay Goel, Gopinath Munde, S.S. Ahluwalia, Narendra Modi, Shivraj Singh Chauhan, Raman Singh, B.S. Yeddyurappa, Prem Kumar Dhumal, Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank and Sushil Modi.         
	These leaders are a certainty out of the total 25 who will attend the meet.         
	Some sources say joint general secretaries V. Satish and Saudan Singh will also attend. Others say Chandan Mitra and Murlidhar Rao, who are assisting Bal Apte in preparing the draft for the brainstorming session, could also take part.         
	This means that powerful dissenters like Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie are not being invited. Both leaders had asked uncomfortable questions about the campaign management in the run-up to the elections and derided the leadership for rewarding the guilty.         
	Shourie has been an important party ideologue and analyst while Sinha has held important portfolios like finance and external affairs in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government.         
	Many leaders privately question the criteria for selecting participants which have left out leaders like Sinha, who was given vital responsibilities by the party at both national and international forums during the NDA regime.         
	Apart from heading several groups of ministers and being the only non-Congress finance minister to have presented five budgets, Sinha also chaired the G20 and was the first Indian to head the World Banks development committee.         
	But party sources say Advani is in no mood for a post-mortem and, instead, wants the chintan baithak to work out ways to expand the party to new territories, strengthen its ideological roots and help it regain its status.         
	Advani, sources say, knows post-mortem will again bring his aides under scrutiny, watering down the gains of a fruitful parliamentary session.

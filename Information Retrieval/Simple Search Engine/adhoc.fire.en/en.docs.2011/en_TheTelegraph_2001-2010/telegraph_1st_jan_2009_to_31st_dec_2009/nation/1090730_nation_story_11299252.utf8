The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Jail for dumping mom in graveyard
                                                                                                               Jail for dumping mom in graveyard
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, July 29: Three sons who left their old mother to die in a graveyard have been jailed for three years by an Andhra court, which looked beyond a parents welfare law that would have restricted the sentence to three months.        
	Chittoor district judge Tarka Raman instead charged Ramesh, 35, Nagaraj, 33, and Sudhakar, 31, with homicide not amounting to murder after a trial that lasted over two-and-a-half years.        
	The three have the option of moving a higher court against the verdict.        
	The case had hit headlines after a local daily reported the plight of the ailing Parvatamma as she lay in the graveyard for three days without a roof over her head. Neighbours took the 62-year-old to a government hospital, where she died two days later.        
	Yesterdays judgment should be a message to all youngsters to not ignore their aged parents, said Peter Subbaiah, who runs an old age home in Hyderabad.        
	Police officer Shivaiah said the sessions judge didnt apply provisions of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007, which Parliament passed barely weeks after Parvatammas death in November. Under the act, which makes it compulsory for children and relatives to provide maintenance to their parents and aged members of the family, the maximum punishment for the three brothers would have been three months.        
	At last there is one legal relief, said former Hyderabad police chief Prabhakar Rao. But the court should have mentioned some dos and donts for the benefit of aged people left to fend for themselves in villages and district towns.        
	Ill-treatment of the elderly is, however, not limited to villages and towns. Five years ago, an 82-year-old man knocked on the doors of Calcutta High Court alleging torture at the hands of his son and daughter-in-law.        
	Parvatammas ordeal began after the death of her husband, a tailor, in their village Pacchikapallam, 568km south of Hyderabad. She managed to survive the first three years without help from her sons. But two years ago, they sold the house. Parvatamma didnt want the monthly allowance they offered her, she wanted to live with them. She pleaded with her sons, but they wouldnt take her with them, a villager recalled when the three were first arrested.        
	Ramesh, a teacher in a convent; Nagaraj, a registered medical practitioner, a term used by quacks in rural and urban areas, and Sudhakar, a petty shopkeeper, then hatched the plan to get rid of their mother.

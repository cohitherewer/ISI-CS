	Gaya, March 27: Seeking vote on the basis of the performance of the Nitish Kumar-led NDA govt in the state, Arun Jaitley and Sushil Kumar Modi kicked off BJPs election campaign in the state from Vishnunagari this afternoon.        
	The two leaders, along with former Union health minister C.P. Thakur launched the campaign at a public meeting in Azad Park.        
	Praising Nitish for salvaging Bihar and bringing it on the national development map, Jaitley recounted his experience as the partys in charge of the two Assembly elections in 2005. Even as some villagers occupying the front rows murmured that little change had taken place for the poor, the senior BJP leader recalled that during the 2005 Assembly elections, he was under constant pressure from friends and well-wishers to wind up the campaign and return to the base before sunset as the state was under siege of criminals and Naxalites.        
	People were now freely moving even during the night hours in the state, claimed Jaitley, who recently hit the headlines for his tantrums following differences with party chief Rajnath Singh.        
	Ridiculing the Congress-RJD-LJP alliance that ruled the Centre, Jaitley said that it was an opportunistic coming together of strange bed fellows as the RJD and LJP had nothing in common with Congress and the alliance was prompted by the survival extinct of scamsters who got the investigators and even trial court judges changed during the period.         
	Modi, the deputy chief minister, said that he was not there to seek vote. Instead, he was there to demand wages for the good work done by the Nitish government.         
	Praising Nitish for his steadfastness in remaining with the NDA, Jaitley said that the chief minister had effectively snubbed the Congresss overtures and expressed solidarity with the Advani-led front. If elected to power, the NDA would deal with terrorism with an iron hand and not allow the 26/11-like situation where a handful of intruders sneaking through the sea engaged the commandos for full four days, said Jaitley.        
	In order to present the partys united face, the BJP leadership succeeded in roping in two other important contenders for the lotus symbol  former IPS officer Balbir Chand and former MP Krishna Chaudhary  to publicly endorse Bodh Gaya MLA and party nominee Hari Manjhis candidature.         
	Both Chaudhary and Chand pledged unstinted support to ensure Manjhis victory.

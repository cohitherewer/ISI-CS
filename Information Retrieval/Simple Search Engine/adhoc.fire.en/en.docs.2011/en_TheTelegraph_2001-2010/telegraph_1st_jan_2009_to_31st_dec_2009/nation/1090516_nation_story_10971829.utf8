The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sangma wants PM Pawar
                                                                                                               Sangma wants PM Pawar
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Guwahati, May 15: NCP leader P.A. Sangma today said he was not averse to seeking the BJPs support to make his party chief Sharad Pawar the Prime Minister.        
	He said he had no problem in taking the support from the BJP or the Shiv Sena as he did not think the two parties were communal.        
	The people of India had voted the BJP to power. This means they have rejected the perception of the BJP being communal, otherwise we have to say that the people of India became communal to vote for a communal party. How can we say it is a communal party when it has produced a towering Prime Minister in Atal Bihari Vajpayee? Sangma said.         
	If the BJP voluntarily comes out and says it will support Sharad Pawar as Prime Minister, of course we will take their support, PTI quoted him as saying.

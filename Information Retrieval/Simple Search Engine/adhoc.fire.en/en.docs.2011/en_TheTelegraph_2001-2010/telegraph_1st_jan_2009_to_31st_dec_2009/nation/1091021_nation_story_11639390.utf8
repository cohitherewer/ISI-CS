	New Delhi, Oct. 20: Environment minister Jairam Ramesh today said he had never suggested a deviation from Indias core principles during the ongoing international climate change negotiations.         
	Ramesh said India will never accept legally binding emission-reduction targets and will open any domestic climate change actions to international scrutiny only when such actions are supported by international finance and technology.        
	Internationally legally binding emission reduction targets are for developed countries and developed countries alone, as agreed under the Bali Action Plan (negotiated two years ago), the minister said in a statement issued today.         
	Ramesh said he had written a discussion note on climate change where he had suggested the possibility of some flexibility in Indias stance, keeping the non-negotiables firmly intact.         
	He said he had also written a seven-page letter to members of parliament from all political parties and chief ministers earlier this month, detailing Indias stance. He said he had also stated that accountability for our actions on climate change  through outcome-based legislation, if found acceptable by our parliament  is to our parliament and to our parliament alone.        
	A senior Indian negotiator had told The Telegraph yesterday that US climate change delegates had informed their Indian counterparts earlier this month that Ramesh had assured the US of a slight shift in Indias negotiating position.        
	The US negotiators had told the Indian team that the minister had said that India would be willing to open its domestic actions on climate change to international monitoring, reporting and verification, the Indian official said.

          SANJAY K. JHA                                                       Jaitley (top), Rajnath:   Ready for battle        
	New Delhi, March 6: The BJP today set up nine poll committees and named Arun Jaitley the partys chief election manager.        
	Just two days ago, the party had opened a war room at its headquarters from where Venkaiah Naidu, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi and other leaders were to look after poll logistics.         
	The war room was seen as a means to mollify Venkaiah and others unhappy with the central poll office being disbanded and Jaitley being given the lions share of poll work  even though his wish to be named election management committee chief wasnt granted.        
	Naidu and Naqvi are missing from the committees announced today while Jaitley has got what he wanted.         
	Though Jaitley hasnt been given a free hand  RSS veteran Ram Lal was named associate chief manager  the party did overcome its initial reluctance to formally designate him the poll boss. Jaitley was also made head of the strategy committee and the publicity committee. He had been looking after strategy and publicity anyway after L.K. Advani asked him to, but without the post.         
	Advani, the BJPs candidate for Prime Minister, has wanted Jaitley to be the election in-charge from the outset. Party president Rajnath Singh finally gave in, but also brought in Ram Lal, an RSS veteran with conservative ways that Jaitley might find upsetting.         
	Another RSS leader, Bal Apte, is on the strategy committee. This panel also includes Balbir Punj, Tarun Vijay and Sudheendra Kulkarni while S. Gurumurthy, Swapan Dasgupta and Deepak Chopra are special invitees.         
	Punj, S.S. Ahluwalia and Sidharth Nath Singh have been appointed spokespersons.        
	Sources said the panels were formed after leaders complained against ad-hocism and systems working in disconnect with the party.         
	Most of the election work is being done from Advanis residence and a war room set up outside the party office by his personal aides, after the central election management committee was disbanded last month.         
	However, BJP leaders remain unhappy that Advanis aides like Kulkarni, Punj and Chopra have been given more importance than many experienced party whole-timers.         
	Murlidhar Rao, touted as a bright saffron find, and Amitabh Sinha, the BJPs intellectual cell convener, have been asked to handle central leaders accommodation on tour.         
	The argument behind giving Jaitley primacy is that as a national leader not contesting the polls himself, he has enough time to focus on managing the partys election preparations.         
	But even Venkaiah is not contesting. With charge of the southern states, where BJP has little presence except in Karnataka, he would have more time to spare than Jaitley who is looking after Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Punjab.

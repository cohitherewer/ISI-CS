	Bhubaneswar, March 3: The Congress will choose a young leader to take over the reins in Orissa, if the party comes to power after the Assembly polls, said AICC general secretary Ghulam Nabi Azad.        
	In the past, we had projected various leaders as the chief ministerial candidate in Orissa. But this time we wont project anybody. However, I feel the time has now come some younger leader should take over the reins here, said the Congress leader in charge of Orissa affairs.        
	Asked whether veteran leader J.B. Patnaik would be in the campaigning team for the coming elections, he said: Every leader is welcome.        
	The former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister exuded confidence that the Congress would form government in Orissa after the Assembly polls, as the people had been disillusioned with the BJD-BJP coalition government which ruled the state for almost a decade, but failed miserably on all fronts.        
	Its a non-performing government, which has failed to generate employment and utilise the resources, which would have been mobilised from huge deposit of minerals, said Azad.        
	During the last five years, several MoUs have been signed in Orissa, but the economic condition of the state had not changed, he observed, alleging that the BJD-BJP government had leased out mines to private companies at throwaway prices. Had the minerals been sold at market price through auction, Orissa would not have waited for central funds to take up developmental programmes, he said.         
	Orissa is the only state, where the state government has changed the names of all the central schemes and renamed them to take political mileage. This is totally cheating. Im surprised why the Congress has not gone to the courts challenging the move, he said.        
	Citing another instance of cheating people through the so-called Rs 2 per kg rice scheme for BPL families, Azad said the Centre was providing a subsidy of Rs 11 per kg, while the subsidy component of state government was only Rs 3 per kg.

          G.C. SHEKHAR                                            
	Chennai, July 14: For a country that loves its potboilers, this love story-turned-sour has all the ingredients of one.        
	Foreign locales, a highly educated boy and girl living together, conversion for the sake of love, betrayal, plane chase across continents, confrontation at airport, police intervention, relatives in jail while the hero/villain goes missing  a day before his real wedding.        
	The story, pieced together from a police complaint filed in Tiruchy yesterday, began sometime in 2003.         
	P. Shobha (name changed), a Tamil girl from Delhi with an MBA degree, landed a job with a foreign bank and moved to Sydney with her parents.         
	In 2006, Shobha, then 25, met S. Murthy (name changed), a Tamil Christian working in Sydney as a software engineer. They fell in love and in early 2007, the two got engaged. But Murthy, a year older than Shobha, preferred to keep the news of their engagement a secret from his parents, promising to get their okay soon.        
	The couple, with the blessings of Shobhas parents, started living together in Sydney soon after their engagement.         
	But after about 10 months, in end-2007, Murthy apparently wished to get out of the relationship and shifted to Darwin, a city in northern Australia on the banks of the Timor Sea, without informing his fiance. Shobha, however, tracked him down and travelled to Darwin where she again moved in with him.         
	This time Murthy put a condition for marrying her. She must become a Christian. Shobha agreed and got converted in a local church.        
	On July 7, 2008, Murthy slipped out again and flew out of Australia to his hometown Tiruchy to get married on July 15 to another girl chosen by his parents. Shobha got wind of his plans through friends and followed him by plane.        
	She caught up with him at Chennai airport where she confronted Murthy and asked why he was treating her this way. But Murthy shrugged her off and went home to get married to the chosen bride.         
	The girl then called her father from Sydney. The two showed up at Murthys house in Tiruchy yesterday where the boys family threatened them with dire consequences. Shobha and her father later lodged a complaint of cheating and intimidation against the boy and his family.         
	The police went over to Murthys house, and arrested his mother and two sisters. Murthy and his father have gone missing.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tussle over closing Taj Mahal chamber 
                                                                                                               Tussle over closing Taj Mahal chamber 
          CITHARA PAUL                           Taj Mahal                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 21: The Taj Mahals upper chamber, which houses the replicas of the graves of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal, could be closed to the public if the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) can beat back stiff opposition from tourism operators.         
	The ASI is worried about the conservation of the 17th-century monument as well as its security.        
	The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) had recommended closing the upper chamber after the November terror attacks in Mumbai.        
	The CISF made this suggestion because the chamber has only one entry and exit point and the CISF is of the view that this could pose a large security threat, an ASI official said.        
	We also feel the same, the official added.         
	But tourism operators, who are fighting the move tooth and nail, argue that the chamber is a big attraction at the Taj and closing it would affect flow of visitors.        
	Nearly four lakh tourists visited the heritage monument in 2008.         
	The upper chamber has a lot of exquisite marble mesh screens with inlaid borders, which is quite unique. If we stop tourists from going there, the charm of the Taj Mahal will be affected, said Shihabuddin of the Agra Tourists Welfare Association.         
	Under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958, the public has the right of access to all protected monuments.         
	But Rule 4 of the act gives the ASI the power to temporarily close any part for maintenance and repair, the ASI official said.         
	The president of the Agra Guides Association, Shamshuddin, and Rajeev Tiwari, who heads the Agra Tourists Welfare Chamber, have approached the culture ministry against the proposal to close the chamber.        
	The ASI comes under the culture ministry.        
	ASI sources said the tourism lobby was very powerful and it was likely that the proposal would be blocked.        
	If the tourism industry has its way, then we will have to think of other options like introducing a staggered ticket system to limit the number of visits, the ASI official said.        
	This would mean visitors to the monument to love would have to pay extra to see the chamber.         
	In the past, the ASI had decided to restrict the number of visitors to conserve the ambience of the heritage monument but was unable to do so in the face of pressure from business quarters, the ASI official said.        
	Heritage monuments are not just about making money by attracting tourists, the official added.        
	There can be any number of alternative sources for revenue generation in the tourism sector but that should not be at the cost of heritage. If our heritage is damaged, you cant build it.

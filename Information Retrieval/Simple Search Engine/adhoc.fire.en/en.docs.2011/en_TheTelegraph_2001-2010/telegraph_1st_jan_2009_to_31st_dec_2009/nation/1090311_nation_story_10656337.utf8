The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | An aam mission unaccomplished

	New Delhi, March 10: Sukhbir had voted Congress in the last general election. The Delhi vendor, who earns about Rs 3,000 a month, had hoped he and his family would benefit from the UPA governments plans for the urban aam aadmi  which to Sukhbir meant the slum dweller.        
	Five years on, he says he is disappointed. So are many others like him.        
	Sukhbirs hopes had risen when the government came out with the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission four years ago. The mission, overseen by S. Jaipal Reddys urban development ministry, pledged to transform urban India not only with better roads, flyovers and transport but also by providing housing and sanitation to people like Sukhbir.        
	The government had promised that the urban poor would be provided housing near their places of occupation before their slums could be demolished for development. Forcible evictions and demolitions would be a thing of the past.        
	Today, Sukhbir and his family of four live by the roadside, his home having been flattened to allow a flyover to come up. Around 40 per cent of the capital assigned for the mission was to be used for the development of the urban poor. But in most cities, the money sanctioned for slum dwellers has been used to build roads, flyovers and hotels.        
	Slums have often needed to be razed to make room for these infrastructure projects  but the promised resettlement has stayed elusive.        
	The bulldozer has been brought in also to free up land for high-rises and private investment. The fast-track development, social activists say, has eaten up any free land where the government could have built houses for people like Sukhbir.        
	But its not as if the roads, flyovers and public transport systems are off to a flyer under the mission in every Indian city.        
	Under the mission, the Centre grants 35 per cent of the money for a project in a big city, the state 15 per cent and the civic body arranges for 50 per cent. Many cities failed to generate their own share of the funds.        
	This means, after receiving the first instalment of the central grant, they couldnt show implementation within the deadline and, under mission rules, the next instalment was stopped.        
	Besides, there has been little progress on several mandatory reforms. Of the 63 cities, only seven have recorded 100 per cent water supply, and only one has enacted a public-disclosure law about spending (the mission insists on complete transparency on every penny spent). Just eight cities have introduced rent-control reforms to look after the interests of the urban middle class and poor, and only nine have rationalised stamp duties to five per cent.         
	The thrust on e-governance has yielded little result, with only 11 cities having built the related set-up.         
	Many have faulted the system of fund allocation too. The sums are handed out not based on the viability of the projects but according to a pre-determined pattern. Cities with over four million people get central assistance up to 35 per cent of the project cost; those with a population between 1 million and 4 million get up to 50 per cent; and cities in the Northeast and Jammu and Kashmir get up to 90 per cent.        
	The government has taken some positive steps to improve road traffic. To boost public transport and discourage private vehicles, the urban development ministry has launched a new scheme for all 63 mission cities to introduce modern buses and the Bus Rapid Transit System.        
	One good step has been the rule making it mandatory for states and cities to set up a Dedicated Urban Transport Fund if they want money under the urban renewal mission.        
	However, the urbanisation boom and unplanned development have hobbled the transport scheme from the start  you cannot have great public transport on the narrow, congested, waterlogging-prone roads of overpopulated cities.        
	Of the 87 Indian cities that have a population of 50 lakh or more, only 20 have effective public transport, the rest depending on auto-rickshaws and unregulated private bus operators.        
	The failure to solve the problem of slum dwellers  spread across 640 towns in 26 states and Union territories, according to the 2001 census  has affected Indias overall water and sanitation targets too.        
	For instance, NGO data show, an estimated 91,000 tonnes of human waste is left in the fields and on river banks and roads every day by Indians, a large number of them being slum dwellers. More than half of the countrys 20.3 crore households lack toilets, with some 66.5 crore Indians defecating in the open.        
	Experts say the government needs to work out a national urbanisation policy if the condition of the urban poor is to be improved at a time the countrys urban population is growing at a breakneck speed.        
	Unlike the urban renewal mission, a national urbanisation policy will not work on a city-to-city basis but encompass the length and breadth of the country. It will select sites from across India to build the houses for the urban poor, choosing places where there is not only free land but also livelihood opportunities.        
	Besides, the experts say, there should be greater effort to develop the villages so their residents do not shift to the cities.

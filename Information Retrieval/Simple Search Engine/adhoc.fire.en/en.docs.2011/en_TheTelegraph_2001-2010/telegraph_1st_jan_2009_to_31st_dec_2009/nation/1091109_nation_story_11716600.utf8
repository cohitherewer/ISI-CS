	Srinagar, Nov. 8: Militants killed a Hizb-ul Mujahideen operative-turned-BSF jawan and his wife and injured their nine-year-old son at their home today, over a decade after he surrendered and joined the force.        
	Mohammad Arif and his wife Malika Khatoon were killed and their nine-year-old son Abrar suffered injuries in his leg, said Shabir Chowdhary, the police chief of Jammus Rajouri district, where the attack occurred.         
	Arifs other two sons escaped by hiding under a bed when the two militants broke into their house in the Khandigali-Budhal region, around 215km from Jammu town, and opened fire.         
	Arif, a police source said, was posted in Assam. He was home on leave and was to go back in a few days. He had earlier actively participated in operations against militants here (in Jammu and Kashmir).        
	In a separate incident, an army junior commissioned officer was killed and two soldiers were injured after an explosive device went off near a forward post on the LoC in Poonch district around seven this morning.         
	An army officer said the cause of the explosion was being probed. We are looking at all the angles, whether it was enemy fire or our landmine which caused the explosion.         
	The officer added that the troops were returning from patrol when the explosion took place. The injured jawans were flown by helicopter to the army hospital in Udhampur, sources said.         
	In another incident, a jawan of 7 Jammu and Kashmir Rifles was critically injured in a mine explosion at Tarkundi in Rajouris Balakote area. He has been admitted to the Rajouri district hospital.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Deal stink in CPM, BJP phone call list
                                                                                                               Deal stink in CPM, BJP phone call list
          JOHN MARY                              
	Thiruvananthapuram, Jan. 4: A television channel has revealed that CPM and BJP leaders in a Kerala district were in touch over mobile phone in the run-up to municipal by-elections last month amid allegations of a covert deal.        
	However, CPM rebels, under the banner of the Janakeeya Vikasana Samity (JVS), won eight seats in the December 16 elections in nine wards of Shoranur municipality in the northern Palakkad district, while the party scraped through in one.         
	Rebel leader and former vice-chairman M.R. Murali, a known supporter of chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan, had alleged during and after the elections that local CPM leaders had struck a deal with their BJP counterparts to defeat the JVS.         
	Manorama News telecast details of calls from BJP state committee member N. Sivarajans mobile phone to M. Hamza, the local CPM legislator, CPM district secretary P. Unni and a local businessman between December 4 and 24.         
	Hamza denied allegations of a vote deal with arch rival BJP but, about the phone calls, said: Being a politician and the local MLA, many people would call me. I would have to check whether I had received calls from the BJP man.         
	But later, he told a reporter he had talked to the BJP leader in the context of apprehensions of pre-poll violence.         
	Murali retorted that local people had been fully aware of the deal and the call details had endorsed his allegation.         
	The rebels had forced the byelections on the CPM after it expelled Murali for refusing to step down as municipal vice-chairman. Eight other councillors who back Murali resigned.        
	The town council profile has now changed: the JVS has 8 councillors, the Congress-led UDF 15, CPM 14 and the BJP 1.         
	The CPM, however, has refused to give up power and is delaying the swearing-in of the new councillors.

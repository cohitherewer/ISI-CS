The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mamata ally quits
                                                                                                               Mamata ally quits
                            
	Calcutta, April 9: The Janabadi Forward Bloc, a breakaway group of the Forward Bloc that had tied up with the Trinamul Congress, today walked out of the alliance saying Mamata Banerjee was autocratic and undemocratic, reports our special correspondent.        
	The party said it wants to be a part of the Left Front. It is the third ally  though small  to have deserted Trinamul in the run-up to the elections.         
	The other two were the Party for Democratic Socialism and the Samajwadi Party.        
	The Janabadi Forward Bloc, which was floated in 2006, had joined forces with Trinamul when she stepped up her land campaign in Singur and Nandigram.         
	We were part of the alliance but she fielded her nominee in the Cooch Behar seat that she had promised to give us, said Janabadi Bloc general secretary Jayanta Roy, calling her autocratic and undemocratic.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Left plays Cong card to split Opposition 
                                                                                                               Left plays Cong card to split Opposition 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 24: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today declined to rule out the communists working with the Congress after the polls, with senior Left sources suggesting it was a tactic to confuse and divide the Congress-Trinamul alliance.        
	The CPM knows that Mamata Banerjee would dearly want the Congress to abandon any thought of a post-poll understanding with the Left, and is playing to keep her and the Congress in suspense, these sources said.        
	Every time Pranab Mukherjee or a senior Congress person says we may have to speak to the Left (after the elections), it adds to our strategy to drive a wedge between the Congress and the Trinamul, a Left leader said.        
	The perception has already gained ground (in the Congress) that in striking an alliance with Trinamul, the Congress has surrendered. Our emphasis will be to widen the rift.        
	Bhattacharjee, asked if the Left could again ally with the Congress, told CNN-IBN: We are not committing anything.... After elections, when the situation will arise, we will discuss the concrete situation.        
	He appeared to keep all options open on the matter of the Left joining the government, and even praised Manmohan Singh.        
	He is a knowledgeable economist and a man of integrity but his pro-American policies I do not like, the Bengal chief minister said. It is not the question of the individual. It is the question of policies.        
	A Congress strategist said: There is a real possibility of a political dilemma on Bengal after May 16. All the post-poll scenarios we have drawn up (include) the possibility of seeking Left support to form a government.        
	We know that the Left and Mamata cannot co-exist in the same space. But in a game of numbers, if we require the Left more, the choice is clear.        
	Bhattacharjees comments came on a day party chief Prakash Karat stuck to his insistence on a non-Congress government with the Congress remaining outside and extending support.         
	Many Congress leaders have hinted they are against propping up a third front government from outside.        
	Karat laid down a few ground rules for the post-results negotiations. He said the Left Front was part of a larger bloc that included its pre-poll allies: the Telugu Desam Party, Telengana Rashtra Samiti, ADMK, Janata Dal (Secular) and the Biju Janata Dal. Any party seeking a post-poll alliance with the Left would also have to deal with these allies.        
	Asked about the overtures from Sharad Pawar, Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan, Karat said: We will come to a common understanding and approach after the polls. Dont try to isolate the Left from our allies.        
	In a message to the shaky UPA coalition, he said: We will not abandon our friends. Whatever decision we take will be in consultation with our allies.        
	He criticised the Prime Ministers observation that regional parties have no issues and stated that two such parties  the Telugu Desam and the ADMK  had taken clear and categorical stands on the Indo-US nuclear deal.        
	Asked if the Left would agree to support a Congress government minus Manmohan Singh, Karat replied: The Congress is Congress. There is going to be no change in the party. The continuance of strategic partnerships with Israel and the US is proof of that.

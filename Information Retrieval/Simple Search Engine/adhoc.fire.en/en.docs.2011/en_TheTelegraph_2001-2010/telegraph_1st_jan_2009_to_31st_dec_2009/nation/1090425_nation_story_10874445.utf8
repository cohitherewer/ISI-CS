The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | SC weight behind air hostesses
                                                                                                               SC weight behind air hostesses
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 24: The Supreme Court today disapproved of Indian Airliness move to dismiss two overweight air hostesses, saying good conduct and not weight should be the parameter for determining performance.        
	The court, however, denied the sacked hostesses any temporary relief.         
	You (Indian Airlines) should focus on how they serve passengers, their good conduct instead of their weight. Weight is no criteria to determine competence, a two-judge bench headed by Justice Tarun Chatterjee said while hearing an application by Sadhna Tanwar and Kiran Chowdhury.         
	All the passengers will be a happier lot if your air hostesses extend a better behaviour rather than your insisting on these conditions, he added.         
	You tell me the mantra on how to lose weight. I havent been able to lose weight, Justice Chatterjee said when the counsel for Air India (the new entity formed after the merger of Indian Airlines and Air-India) insisted that the management was well within its rights to sack them.        
	The national carrier had pleaded that in the present competitive environment with private airlines it could not afford to have overweight air hostesses.        
	Counsel Gopal Subramanium said the airline contracts made it clear that hostesses would have to adhere to their weight charts. Moreover, the duo had been given several chances to slim down.        
	Despite the management repeatedly extending deadlines for weight loss, they did not take action, he claimed.         
	But Justice Chatterjee wondered: In an independent country, will it be a ground? Will it be a ground for dismissal? It can be struck down (termination order). We can do that.        
	Indian Airlines had first grounded several hostesses on the ground that they were overweight. It sacked two of them after the management won the case in the lower court and Delhi High Court in September 2008.         
	The hostesses had then pleaded that the weight standards set for them were medically unrealistic. But the high court had rejected their plea saying that looks were important in todays world.        
	The hostesses counsel, Arvind Sharma, today urged the court to grant them interim relief and restrain the airline from similarly proceeding against others.        
	But the court expressed its inability to grant them interim relief. That would be as good as deciding the matter, it said. We will hear all sides in the matter and then decide.        
	The case will be heard next in August.

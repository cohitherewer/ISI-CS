	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 16: A foreign tourist was held for entering the Jagannath temple in Puri today.        
	Sebastian, a 45-year-old tourist from Chile, was prevented by police when he was trying to enter the temple through the main entrance. Later, he managed to get inside through the south gate. He was spotted by some priests, said the inspector in charge of Sri Jagannath temple police station, A.K. Dalua.         
	The priests caught hold of him and handed him over to the temple administration, he said. Sebastian, who pleaded ignorance of temple rules, was later released following interrogation.

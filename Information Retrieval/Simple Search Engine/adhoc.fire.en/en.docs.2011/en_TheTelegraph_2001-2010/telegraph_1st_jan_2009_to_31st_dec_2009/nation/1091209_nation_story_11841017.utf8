The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Political courtship in Mumbai
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Political courtship in Mumbai
  - BJP awaits an opportune time to strike with Raj and Ajit Pawar        OUR BUREAU                                    Ajit Pawar, Raj Thackeray                                        
	New Delhi, Dec. 8: The BJP has not given up on its Maharashtra blueprint to split the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and cobble together an alternative formation with the help of Raj Thackeray.        
	The ambitious script, authored by Nitin Gadkari who is set to take over as BJP president from Rajnath Singh, is premised on certain political factors and circumstances that are largely uncertain but not implausible.        
	Gadkari hopes to repeat what Rajnath had done in Uttar Pradesh in 1998: break the Congress and sew up a majority after the BJPs alliance with the BSP ended.        
	Ajit Pawar, the nephew of NCP president Sharad Pawar, is central to Gadkaris plans to stir the coalition cauldron in Maharashtra.        
	Just as in 1993, when the BJP worked to breach the Samajwadi Party-BSP alliance in Uttar Pradesh by fanning Mayavatis desire to replace Mulayam Singh Yadav as chief minister and succeeded two-and-a-half years later, the party believes it can play on Ajits ambitions.        
	Ajit was convinced he was Pawars heir apparent until the NCP boss promoted his daughter Supriya Sule over his nephew. Reconciled to the anointment of Supriya, Ajit was allegedly tempted to take up the BJP-Senas offer to make him chief minister after the recent Assembly elections if he managed to get the numbers from the NCP.         
	In the 288-member legislature, the BJP and the Sena have 91 MLAs. Ajit would need to wean away over 50 of the NCPs 62 MLAs to get to the halfway mark.         
	Ajit had publicly claimed earlier that such an offer was made through Gadkari, but Sena MP Manohar Joshi later denied it.         
	Privately now, some concede Ajit had been approached. But he developed cold feet. He is not like his uncle who, at any given time, can get 50 candidates elected. Pawar senior is a hardcore politician from the grassroots with a socially inclusive image that appeals to the rich and the poor. We realised then that the nephew is rather limited, a BJP MP from Maharashtra said.        
	After Ajit wangled two portfolios  water resources and energy  he stopped taking calls from the BJP.         
	Of late, he has re-established his contacts with us. But we are not reading anything much into this, a BJP MLA from Maharashtra said.         
	An Ajit aide said: Ajitdada has friends across the political spectrum. But lately there has been no specific offer.        
	However, those close to Gadkari maintained that just as Mayavati was nothing in the 90s when the BSP was dominated by Kanshi Ram, Ajit could come out of his uncles shadow with prodding and pushing.        
	He has a base of his own, Gadkari told The Telegraph from Nagpur.         
	Asked if he still eyed the NCP, Gadkari said: That moment has passed and things have settled down after Ajit became a minister. Lets see, however, when the next opportunity comes.        
	Those close to Gadkari said Ajits standing with Pawar had come down after his dalliance with the BJP-Sena and he had reached the end of the road in the NCP.        
	The BJPs understanding is that after Pawar, or perhaps even in his lifetime, the NCP could merge with the Congress. If and when that happens, we will strike because there are a lot of elements who might not want to go with the Congress, a Maharashtra MP said.        
	The second strand of Gadkaris script involves making a choice between the Sena and Raj Thackerays Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS).         
	With an ailing Bal Thackeray and his uncharismatic son Uddhav failing to attract Opposition votes, a section is convinced that it makes political sense to go along with the MNS, which is on the way to becoming Maharashtras Trinamul Congress  the fulcrum of Opposition politics.         
	The MNS has 13 MLAs who could be crucial in stitching together an alternative dispensation.         
	The BJPs view is that although the Congress might have tacitly patronised the MNS to split Opposition votes, it was most unlikely to take its support in an uncertain situation because of Rajs negative politics.

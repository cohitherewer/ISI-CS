          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 22: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sanghs plans to appoint leaders from western states to the BJP central apparatus and perhaps project one of them as the partys national chief ran aground today after another dismal showing in Maharashtra.        
	The Sangh, and more specifically, sarsanghchalak Mohanrao Bhagwat had two candidates in mind: Nitin Gadkari from Maharashtra and Manohar Parrikar of Goa.        
	Sources said Bhagwats rationale was the BJP needed to reconsolidate its base in western India after losing Maharashtra in 1999 and Rajasthan in 2008 and, therefore, required a face from the region.        
	He also believed that Gadkari and Parrikar combined discipline and professionalism supposedly ingrained in most politicians from the western states  Pramod Mahajan and Narendra Modi were cited as examples  with youth and dedication to the Sanghs ideals.        
	Although they were not really known nationally, the sources said Bhagwat believed they had the potential to be moulded into leaders capable of heading a party like the BJP after Rajnath Singhs term ended in December.        
	Eyebrows were raised in the BJP when their names started circulating: although Parrikar was chief minister of Goa twice, the sources wondered how, for instance, he would cope with the dynamics of heartland politics.        
	Gadkari, who was a minister in Maharashtra, never contested an election and has always been a member of the legislative council.        
	The Sangh had promoted the two tacitly in the recent elections.        
	Gadkari, with Gopinath Munde, had completely managed the Maharashtra show and minimised the intervention of central leaders  much like Kalyan Singh would when he was the lord and master of all he surveyed in Uttar Pradesh.        
	Parrikar was pulled out of Goa for the first time to campaign in Maharashtra.        
	Those uncomfortable with the interlopers from the western coast hoped the debacle would knock out Parrikar and Gadkari from the reckoning.         
	The exercise to find Rajnaths successor is expected to gain momentum once 50 per cent of the organisational polls are over and done with.

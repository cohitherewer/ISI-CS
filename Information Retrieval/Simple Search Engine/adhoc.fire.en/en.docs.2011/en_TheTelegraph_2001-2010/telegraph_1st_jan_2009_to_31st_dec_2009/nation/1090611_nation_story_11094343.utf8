          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, June 10: The human resource development ministry has decided to probe deemed universities on its own, independent of a review by the University Grants Commission it had ordered just six days ago.         
	Amid concerns that UGC officials may themselves be implicated in the controversial mushrooming of deemed universities across the country, the HRD ministry has opted to conduct its own inquiry, top officials have revealed.         
	The HRD ministrys probe into both the physical and the academic potential of each deemed-to-be university will run parallel to a UGC review ordered by minister Kapil Sibal on June 4.         
	The move, triggered by fears expressed by senior educationists over the impartiality of the UGC review, exposes for the first time distrust between the new ministry under Sibal and the UGC, Indias top higher education regulator.         
	Ministry officials yesterday began finalising names of academics from reputable educational institutions across streams to conduct its review.         
	The academics picked will have to meet two criteria, sources said. The first, predictably, will be established academic excellence.         
	But it is the second criterion that reflects the attempt to make this probe scrupulously independent of the UGC.         
	No one who has ever been on, or been associated with, any UGC team visiting institutions to determine the grant of deemed university status to them, will be involved in the review. That, we believe, is critical, a source explained.         
	The ministrys reviewers will include faculty from central universities, the Indian Institutes of Technology and the National Institutes of Technology, the source said. After finalising the list of reviewers, the ministry will divide them into teams each in charge of a geographical zone.         
	Usually, a single team is appointed for any review, but Sibal is keen to complete the ministrys probe within 100 days  possible only if the task is shared.         
	Less than a week after taking over, Sibal ordered the UGC to review all deemed universities within three months.         
	But the Professors Forum of India, the countrys largest non-political group of senior educationists from central universities, wrote to Sibal asking for the UGC to be kept out of any review.         
	They argued that UGC officials may themselves be responsible for sub-standard institutions receiving the deemed university status, and a probe conducted by the commission might not be impartial.

	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 17: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik today asked the Centre to assist Orissa in training and capacity building of the police force to deal with Left-wing extremists and provide at least 10 trainers of the elite NSG for this purpose.        
	Speaking at the chief ministers conference on internal security in New Delhi today, Naveen emphasised the need for resources for training and capacity building of police force and requested the Centre to assist in this venture on matching contribution basis, either under police modernisation scheme or a new one.        
	He also urged the Union home minister, P. Chidambaram, for giving training slots at central police institutes for basic training of the 4th and 5th India Reserve Battalions to make them operational at the earliest.        
	Expressing concern over the resurgence of Naxalism in Orissa and neighbouring states, Naveen appealed the Centre and states to put their resources together to fight the growing menace. He underlined the need to have a strengthened intelligence set-up.        
	Urging for expanding the scope and coverage of the police modernisation scheme, Naveen requested the Centre to enhance the size of the central assistance under the scheme from the present level of Rs 42 crore to Rs 80 crore. Fortification of police posts must be taken up urgently, if we have to prevent recurrence of Maoist attacks in the short run, he said.        
	Informing that all the five coastal police stations sanctioned by the Centre following 26/11 have been operational, Naveen asked for sanction of five more such police stations as the state has 480km coastline.

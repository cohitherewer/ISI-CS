The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sangh pre-poll scare for BJP
                                                                                                               Sangh pre-poll scare for BJP
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 11: The RSS has been sucked into another controversy after its chief, Mohanrao Bhagwat, was quoted by a news agency as saying that his cadres were under no compulsion to support the BJP, the Sanghs political child.        
	The report, picked up by TV channels, quoted a Sangh source as saying that at a meeting on Saturday, Bhagwat had said the cadres were free to endorse any political party on the basis of its policy and programmes in the national interest.        
	Bhagwats alleged remark came at a meeting hosted by the Bihar unit of the RSS at Rajgir, where the RSS central working committee is also in session.        
	BJP sources sounded worried about what effect the statement would have on Sangh and party workers just two days before the Assembly elections, more so in Maharashtra where the Sangh is headquartered. Apart from Nagpur, the Sangh has a presence and base in several Maharashtra towns and cities, including Pune and Mumbai.        
	However, BJP Rajya Sabha MP and spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad, who attended the meeting addressed by Bhagwat yesterday, dubbed the agency report baseless.        
	He claimed that the RSS chief had spoken of the great potential the BJP had. There were as many as 500 party workers at the meeting, he said.        
	Another senior Sangh representative said that while Bhagwat had alluded to the BJPs problems, he had sounded optimistic that they would be shortly resolved because the issues were small and not very major.        
	The representative said that one of the Bihar swayamsevaks had asked Bhagwat how long the crisis within the BJP would last. Bhagwat apparently replied it was not as big as the media was making it out to be.        
	Bhagwats statement, as reported by the agency, comes after two of his colleagues, Manmohan Vaidya and Madan Das Devi, had praised Rahul Gandhi and home minister P. Chidambaram  Vaidya obliquely and Devi lavishly.        
	At a news conference in Rajgir yesterday, Devi had commended Chidambarams moves to stem Maoist insurgency and said the RSS was satisfied with him.         
	BJP sources monitoring the Rajgir conclave were quick to put a spin on the statements. It means the Sangh is upset with us, and more so with Advani and his followers, for putting out an impression that he has no intention of quitting soon (as leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha), a source said.        
	In the lead-up to the RSS conference, former BJP president and Advani loyalist M. Venkaiah Naidu had said that his mentor had not been set a quit deadline. He had added that while Advani would not lead the party into the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, he would pass the baton at a time of his choosing and also select and name his successor.        
	Some sections felt Naidu had thrown a gauntlet at the Sangh. It is learnt the Sangh wanted a new leader of the Opposition before the winter session of Parliament, which begins in November.

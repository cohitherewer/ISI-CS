The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | If its not Rahul, BJPs happy 
                                                                                                               If its not Rahul, BJPs happy 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Nagpur, Feb. 7: The BJP is relieved: Sonia Gandhi has hinted Manmohan Singh will be her choice for the next Prime Minister, so it need not worry about the poll battle turning into a referendum on youth versus age.        
	Party leaders relief might deepen when they see pictures in Sundays papers of Rahul Gandhi riding a bicycle through Delhis streets. Its this youthful image of the Amethi MP that the octogenarian L.K. Advani, the BJPs shadow Prime Minister, can never hope to match.        
	The BJP can therefore be forgiven for feeling that it is better equipped to counter Singh. The party has already begun chalking up its response to his probable candidature.        
	Arun Jaitley today said Advanis decisive leadership would be an advantage for the NDA against Manmohans apparent lack of authority. The country today needs a determined leader, decisive governance and coherent alliance. These features are missing in the UPA and its prime ministerial candidate, he said.        
	The BJP has often tarred Singh as a weak Prime Minister, claiming that Sonia wielded the real power. The party now plans to accuse Sonia of grooming Rahul for the top job while using Singh as a stopgap arrangement.        
	Although Manmohan Singh will be the leader, the campaign will not revolve around him, Jaitley said.        
	The BJP will, however, not keep Sonia or Rahul at the centre of its offensive because it feels targeting Singh is easier. Nor is it likely to make Sonias foreign origin an issue as it had done in the last election. As she is not the candidate for Prime Minister, this issue, which does exist, automatically gets diluted, Jaitley said.        
	The focus at the two-day BJP national council was on projecting Advanis candidature. A special presentation was made yesterday on how to showcase his leadership.        
	Most speakers at todays open session stressed Advanis experience, tough leadership and vision. Party boss Rajnath Singh cited how Advani had worked closely with Atal Bihari Vajpayee for 55 years.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rs 128-crore candidate
                                                                                                               Rs 128-crore candidate
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Abu Azmi on his way to file his nomination. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, April 6: Money  a fistful as well as mountains of it  brought some unwelcome attention on Abu Asim Azmi the day he filed his nomination papers as the Samajwadi Party candidate from Mumbai North West.        
	TV channels showed alleged supporters of Azmi, an accused in the Bombay blasts case who has been acquitted by the Supreme Court, doling out cash to people outside the collectors office while he was inside filing his nomination. Azmi later suggested that the money could have been given to buy water for thirsty party workers.        
	The throats of officials inside the collectors office must also have gone dry while vetting Azmis papers. Azmis affidavit has put the worth of his assets at Rs 128.3 crore, perhaps one of the highest declared by a candidate in this general election.        
	According to the affidavit, Azmi possesses property valued at Rs 95.3 crore. His wife Zahida has properties worth Rs 1.62 crore in her name. Land, shares and savings account for the rest of the assets. He owns three cars, collectively valued at Rs 27 lakh.        
	A former Rajya Sabha MP, Azmi is the state chief of Mulayam Singh Yadavs party. He dabbles in several businesses and owns at least two restaurants and a chain of footwear shops. The restaurants are managed by his son Farhan Azmi, who recently married actress Ayesha Takia.         
	Azmi was arrested in the 1993 serial blasts case on the charge of providing tickets to conspirators who travelled to Pakistan for training, but was discharged by the Supreme Court. He has been arrested several times for making provocative speeches.        
	In the money distribution controversy, one activist has been identified as Abus brother. We will investigate and initiate action if required, an official said.         
	Azmi denied the allegations. I was inside the collectors office. I cant be held responsible for what my supporters were supposedly doing. There is no question of distributing money.        
	PTI later quoted Azmi as saying the money could have been given by his brother and his friends for workers to buy water. The money could also have been meant for those who played the drums, he said.

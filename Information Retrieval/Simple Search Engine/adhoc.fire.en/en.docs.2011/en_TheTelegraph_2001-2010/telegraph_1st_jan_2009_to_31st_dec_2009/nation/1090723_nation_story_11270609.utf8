          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, July 22: The government today came under scathing attack from the Opposition for its alleged failure in plugging tax pilferage and inordinate delay in modernisation of inter-state check gates.         
	The state is deliberately allowing tax pilferage at the inter-state check gates and therefore sitting over the modernisation proposal, alleged the Opposition in the Assembly today.        
	Admitting that the government has not been able to plug tax pilferage at the check gates fully, finance minister Prafulla Chandra Ghadei said the modernisation of four major inter-state toll gates would be taken up soon, which would check corruption and help in tax collection.         
	We have already initiated measures to start modernisation work in compliance with a Supreme Court directive, said Ghadei, adding that a inter-departmental committee was constituted to examine the Rs 6 crore DPR submitted by Electronics Corporation of India.

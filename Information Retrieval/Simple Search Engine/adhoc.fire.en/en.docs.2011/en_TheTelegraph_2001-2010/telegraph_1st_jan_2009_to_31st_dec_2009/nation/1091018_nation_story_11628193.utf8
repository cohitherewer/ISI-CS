The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Our Shaashee, the New York MP   Triumphal return to UN

	New York, Oct. 17: When Shashi Tharoor, the minister of state for external affairs, walked into the UN General Assembly hall this week to speak on behalf of India at a commemoration event, Benins foreign minister Jean-Marie Ehouzou rushed to greet him with the warmth reserved for an old friend.        
	Behind him in a queue to greet Tharoor was the attractive First Lady of El Salvador, Brazilian-born Vanda Pignato, who pulled the Indian minister aside seeking a meeting to discuss upgrading of ties between San Salvador and New Delhi.         
	At the entrance to the UN headquarters, a security guard who has seen Tharoor several times a day for at least a decade, asked an Indian official: Our Shaashee, is he now a minister in your government?        
	Benins minister told the newly minted Indian politician as the two men conversed in French that Tharoors presence at the UN this week was a retour de force, or a triumphal return, and what he had done was reculer detour mieux sauter, that is, to step back to jump higher.         
	In a sense, both the men had done the same: Jean-Marie Ehouzou was Benins permanent representative to the UN, and earlier, his foreign ministrys director for international organisations and they had known each other during Tharoors long, 29-year work for the UN.         
	This week, Tharoor was stepping into the UN building for the very first time since he lost the election as Indias candidate for the post of UN secretary-general, resigned his job as an under secretary-general for public information and left New York.         
	On Wednesday, Tharoor met Ban Ki-moon, the man who defeated him in that election. Indian officials said the meeting lasted one hour and 10 minutes and described it as very warm and effusive.        
	Actually, during Tharoors almost three decades at the UN, he had known Ban as well, when the secretary-general worked at the UN headquarters in 2001-2002 as chef de cabinet to the Korean president of the UN General Assembly.         
	It was a retour de force for Tharoor outside the UN building as well.         
	When Hillary Clinton was an aspirant for the White House last year and was taking on the man who eventually became US President in their partys primaries, Barack Obamas campaign had alluded to Clintons India connections and described her in a memo as the Democratic member of the US Senate from Punjab.         
	Any reporter following Tharoor here this week would have been similarly tempted to describe him as a member of the Lok Sabha from New York, the city that was his home until two-and-a-half years ago.         
	Tharoors very first event on arrival here was a rousing reception, 45 minutes away from Manhattan, proudly organised by Malayalees in Greater New York for the new MP from their state capital.         
	On Wednesday, at the Kerala Centre, the Global Organisation of People of Indian Origin hosted a similar event that, some said, was like an enthusiastic election rally by Indian Americans who would have liked to, but could not, vote for Tharoor back home.         
	But it was while addressing three think tanks in the course of the week that the minister came into his own as someone who not only knew what he was talking about but also as a spokesperson for India who knew how to effectively convey what he knows.         
	Tibor Tth, executive secretary of the Preparatory Commission of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organisation (CTBTO), put off his departure from New York by a day to hear the Indian minister speak at a working dinner at the East-West Institute on Thursday.        
	With global disarmament gaining momentum, what India has to say authoritatively about the test ban treaty is of tremendous interest for the strategic community across the world.         
	Helen Clark, New Zealands three-term Prime Minister, who became head of the UN Development Programme in April, surprised many people when she announced at a meeting with Tharoor on Tuesday that she would go to a think tank event where the minister was speaking two days later.        
	Tharoor made history this week when he became the only Indian politician to appear on a comedy show that has a huge television viewership from coast to coast in the US.        
	This was Tharoors third appearance on The Colbert Report, where a guests wit and capacity for split-second repartee are often tested.        
	At one appearance, the host, Stephen Colbert, put it to Tharoor that diplomacy was outdated, but pat came the Indians reply, quoting French statesman Talleyrand, that the one thing you cant do with a bayonet is sit on it.         
	Similarly, Tharoor responded to Colberts suggestion that the UN should be called US if was not anti-American by instantly pointing out that Winston Churchills first preference for the world body in 1945 was United States, but that the name was already taken.

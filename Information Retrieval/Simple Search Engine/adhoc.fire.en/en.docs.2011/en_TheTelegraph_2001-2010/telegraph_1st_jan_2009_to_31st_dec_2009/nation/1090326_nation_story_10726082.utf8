The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Coming up: 24x7   ragging helpline
                                                                                                               Coming up: 24x7   ragging helpline
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, March 25: Help may soon be just a phone call away for hapless victims of ragging across the country.         
	India is launching a national toll-free helpline for ragging victims that will aim to provide help within minutes of a complaint, under intense pressure from students after a recent spate of ragging-related violence.         
	The Supreme Court-appointed anti-ragging committee headed by former CBI director R.K. Raghavan today decided on Indias first such move to provide 24x7 succour to victims all over India, sources said.         
	The committee has asked the human resource development ministry to take responsibility for running the helpline, which is to be set up before the start of the 2009 academic session, they said.         
	Several student-campaigners against ragging have, over the past year, repeatedly asked the HRD ministry to set up a helpline to tackle the menace but the government had ignored their request.         
	The ministry is, however, bound by the Supreme Courts directives to follow orders of the Raghavan panel. A joint secretary of the ministry is member-secretary of the panel.         
	Ministry sources hinted the helpline might be outsourced to NGOs working against ragging, but said they would monitor its functioning and would be in-charge nationally.         
	A students complaint on the helpline would immediately be registered in a centrally managed database, they said, and the administration at the institute would be called.         
	The sources said the students anonymity would be maintained in all cases by the helpline managers, who would inform the administrators about the alleged perpetrators and ask them to take action. If the victim says he fears physical injury, the administration would be required to act immediately, a source said.         
	The decision to set up the helpline is an indictment of regulatory authorities in charge of Indias higher education, said sources on the Raghavan panel that met in the capital today.         
	Raghavan, it is learnt, was livid at all regulatory authorities  including the University Grants Commission, All India Council of Technical Education and the Medical Council of India  apart from the Dental Council of India.         
	Of the 11 regulatory authorities that govern different streams of higher education, the dental council is the only body to have introduced rules against institutions under it that fail to curb ragging.         
	The committee decided that it would inform the court in a report at a special hearing on Monday that the government and higher education regulators had failed to implement its recommendations.        
	All regulatory authorities promised the panel today that they would introduce anti-ragging regulations within a month.         
	A 19-year-old medical student, Aman Kachru, was killed during ragging by his seniors at a Himachal Pradesh college early this month. A student in Andhra Pradesh tried to commit suicide after her college administration failed to take cognisance of her complaints against ragging.         
	Had regulatory bodies followed the recommendations of the panel, Aman Kachru may still have been alive, said Rajendra Prasad, a member on the Raghavan panel.         
	The apex court has accepted all recommendations of the committee  effectively making them legally mandatory.         
	But several key recommendations remain unimplemented  a criticism Raghavan will level in his report on Monday.         
	The panel had recommended a dedicated cadre of hostel wardens for colleges  teachers now double up as wardens and are often unable to focus on hostel-related concerns.         
	It had also recommended that regulatory authorities cut off funds for institutions that repeatedly fail to prevent ragging-related incidents or are lax in reacting to such incidents.         
	Neither of the two recommendations has been implemented yet.

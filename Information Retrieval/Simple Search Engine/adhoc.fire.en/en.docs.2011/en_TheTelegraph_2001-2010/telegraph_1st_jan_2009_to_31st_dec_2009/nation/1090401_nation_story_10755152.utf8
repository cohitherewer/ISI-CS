The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bangla mutiny probe under death cloud
                                                                                                               Bangla mutiny probe under death cloud

	New Delhi, March 31: Investigations by authorities in Dhaka into the mutiny by the Bangladesh border guard are throwing up more questions than answers, confusing national and international observers alike.         
	The main body of ministerial investigators has been given 30 more days to submit its report. But the death in custody of 11 mutineers is clouding the probe.         
	More than 70 persons, most of them army officers, were killed in the mutiny more than a month back. Reports collated here suggest that a section of army officers formerly deputed to the BDR are refusing to return to the force because they do not fully trust the troops.         
	The BDR chief is due in Delhi tomorrow for scheduled talks with his Border Security Force counterpart.         
	The main investigation into the bloody mutiny of February 25-26 is led by an 11-member ministerial committee but there are also separate probes by the Criminal Investigation Department and the Bangladesh Army, all of which are said to be coordinated by the Bangladesh commerce minister and former army officer, Colonel (retired) Faruk.         
	But the governments main investigators have now been given a second extension of 30 days and can be expected to come out with their report only at the end of April, reports say. They were at first asked to submit a report in seven days.        
	In the interim no less than 11 mutineers have died or have been killed in suspicious circumstances. Most of them were arrested and in the custody of the army. The army is conducting its own investigation, a development that suggests that its trust in the governments process is wanting.         
	The foreign agencies  the UKs Scotland Yard and the USFBI  are expected to feed into the ministerial committee headed by home minister Sahara Khatun and a former bureaucrat Anis Uz Zaman with forensic analysis and other evidence.         
	Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said last week that she suspected the mutiny was part of a conspiracy to plunge the country into civil war.         
	The CID has questioned a prominent Jamaat-i-Islami leader Abdur Razzaq and 450 other suspects so far. Mention has also been made of a shipping magnate close to Bangladesh Nationalist Party leader Khaleda Zia, Salahuddin Qader Chowdhury, but he has not been detained or interrogated.

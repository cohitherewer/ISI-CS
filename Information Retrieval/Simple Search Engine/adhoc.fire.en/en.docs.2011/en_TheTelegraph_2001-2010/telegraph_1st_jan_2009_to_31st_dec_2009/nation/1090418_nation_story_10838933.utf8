                                                                                                               Turnout amp; claims high in Kerala
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Thiruvananthapuram, April 17: Turnout in yesterdays elections in Kerala was 73.33 per cent, up from 68 per cent initially estimated and 71.45 per cent in 2004.        
	The final figures, released by the Election Commission today, prompted claims from the two main contenders, the ruling Left-led alliance and the Congress-led United Democratic Front, that the higher turnout meant a mandate in their favour.        
	The CPM said the Left front would get 12 to 15 seats. But the Congresss Oommen Chandy, the leader of the state Opposition, said he saw no reason why the UDF should get less than 18.        
	Chandy shrugged off worries over Thiruvananthapuram, where the turnout was the lowest at 65.73 per cent, saying the high-profile Congress candidate, Shashi Tharoor, had all-round support.        
	Kannur recorded the highest turnout at 80.92 per cent, followed by Vadakara at 80.45 per cent. Both are in politically active north Kerala.        
	Turnout in Kerala has never dipped below 70 since 1984.

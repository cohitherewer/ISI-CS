	Patna, Sept. 30: For Bihar, the twin boat mishaps that left over 60 people dead on Monday is apparently routine  absence of a licensing authority and the state governments appalling apathy have meant that over 200 people die every year in boat capsizes, particularly between July and October.        
	On Monday, the overloaded boat shuddered and then sank midstream on Bagmati river after a sudden storm lashed Khagaria district. Similarly stormy weather conditions led to the capsize of the boat carrying Puja revellers in Kamala Balan river in Darbhanga district the same day.        
	Eyewitnesses said over 150 people were on board the boat with a capacity to accommodate only 60 when it capsized near Phultoda ghat in Khagaria. But, ghat contractor German Mukhiya disputed the over-loading assertion saying the boat was carrying passengers as per its capacity though he did not specify what that number was.        
	Bihars boatmen who ferry people over the states 10 most turbulent rivers do not require any form of registration or licence. Among the most dangerous of rivers were the Bagmati, Kosi, Gandak, Burhi Gandak, Mahananda and Son which are known for their strong currents.        
	However, the most surprising aspect of such tragedies is the absence of any administrative infrastructure to regulate the ferrying of people on boats. For instance, there is no agency to keep tabs on the number of boats and boatmen operating in rivers.        
	The government will take stern action in the matter. We will not allow any boatman who has no licence to ferry boats in rivers, the state transport minister, Ramanand Singh, may have said.         
	But, his department has done nothing to regulate boat movement.        
	According to sources, National Navigation Institute at Gaighat in Patna was supposed to provide month-long training to those interested in working as boatmen. On the successful completion of training, these people were to get licences from the Patna-based transport office.         
	While the institute exists only on paper, the transport office has never received any application for a boatmans licence.        
	River experts said there was a policy to fix the capacities of boats in accordance with their size and make their use safe for passengers. But, there is neither a river police force nor river administration personnel to implement the policy, said an expert.        
	The road construction minister, Prem Kumar, tried to offer a solution by explaining that the Khagaria-Alauli bridge would be ready by May 2010 after which passengers would not need boats to cross over.        
	Then the people of Saharbanni, Phultoda and other adjoining villages will not be required to undertake the risk of a boat ride, he said.        
	But experts disagreed. What will happen to the people of Purnea, Katihar, Madhepura, Saharsa and Supaul districts in the Kosi belt where people depend on boats for travelling and transporting cattle and goods? This zone also accounts for maximum boat mishaps, said Hemant, a river expert who has several books to his credit.

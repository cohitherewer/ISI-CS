                                                                                                               Shoe net for Modi
                              Modi: Boot shield                            
	Anand, April 17 (PTI): Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi today addressed a public rally from behind a net put up to shield him against possible shoe missiles.        
	A plastic net was put up in front of the stage of the chief minister as he addressed the rally in Gujarats Anand town.        
	The protective measure came after a spate of shoe attacks on politicians.        
	Jarnail Singh, a Sikh journalist had flung a shoe at home minister P. Chidambaram during a news conference in New Delhi earlier this month after Jagdish Tytler was cleared in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots case.        
	A retired school principal had also hurled a footwear at Congress candidate Navin Jindal at a poll rally in Kurukshetra in Haryana.        
	Yesterday, a disgruntled BJP worker threw his slipper at party leader L.K. Advani in Madhya Pradeshs Katni district.

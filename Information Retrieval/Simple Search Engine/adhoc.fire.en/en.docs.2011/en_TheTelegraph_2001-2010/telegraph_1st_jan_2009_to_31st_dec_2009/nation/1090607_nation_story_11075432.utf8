                                                                                                               Police rift over prime catch
          OUR BUREAU                          Madni: Interrogation tussle                                  
	Mumbai/Delhi, June 6: Cop versus cop over catch.        
	Mumbai police will send two teams to Delhi to quiz Mohammad Umer Madni  the alleged Lashkar-e-Toiba talent scout arrested two days ago near the Qutab Minar  but Delhi police officials are not amused.        
	We havent even interrogated him properly, now they want to come, said an officer, making his displeasure clear.        
	The rift between Delhi police and the Mumbai force goes back to the Batla House encounter in Delhi last September. Sources said both were ready to raid the Jamianagar apartment, but Delhi police scored, though they lost special cell officer Mohan Chand Sharma.        
	The sources also said special cell officials believe Mumbai police started a smear campaign by accusing them of taking a hurried decision to raid the house to pre-empt their Mumbai counterparts.        
	Delhi police commissioner Y.S. Dadwal, however, gave no hint of the rift between the two forces. If they (Mumbai police) want to interrogate him, they can, he said.        
	The Mumbai forces interest in Madni arises from the maulvis proximity to Lashkar founder Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, one of the alleged masterminds of last years terror attacks who was recently freed from house arrest in Pakistan.        
	We have no specific evidence pointing to Madnis role in our case, but we will send a team to interrogate him, said an official with Mumbais crime branch, which is probing the 26/11 strike.        
	A separate team, from Mumbai polices anti-terrorism squad that is investigating the 2006 train bombings, will also question the 50-year-old.        
	We are in touch with Delhi police. After we gather more information about the accused, we will send a team to interrogate Madni, said K.P. Raghuvanshi, additional director-general of police, anti-terrorism squad.        
	The Mumbai teams will also probe possible similarities between the train explosions and the November attacks.

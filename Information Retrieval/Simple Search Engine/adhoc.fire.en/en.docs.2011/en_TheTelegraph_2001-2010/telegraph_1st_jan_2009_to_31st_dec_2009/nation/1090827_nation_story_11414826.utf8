The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pak officials trash dossier and notice
                                                                                                               Pak officials trash dossier and notice
          NASIR JAFFRY                          Hafiz Saeed                                  
	Islamabad, Aug. 26: Pakistani officials today ruled out legal proceedings against Hafiz Saeed on the basis of the latest dossier Delhi submitted last week and also played down the red corner notice Interpol issued yesterday against the alleged Mumbai attack mastermind.        
	The evidence contained in the new dossier is mostly circumstantial and based on the statements made by Ajmal Kasab, Fahim Ansari and Sabauddin Ahmad, a senior foreign ministry official told The Telegraph in Islamabad, referring to the arrested trio being tried in India.        
	About the Interpol notice, the official said it had been issued merely on the basis of a UN Security Council resolution.        
	For us, the evidence India has shared with us is not legally tenable and insufficient to be proven in a court of law, the official said, adding that the statements by Kasab, Ansari and Ahmad that Saeed had a role in the attacks was not enough to prove his guilt.        
	In Delhi, Indias foreign minister said the Interpol notice against the founder of the banned Lashkar-e-Toiba  another was issued against fellow 26/11 suspect Zaki-ur Rehman Lakhvi  was a vindication of the governments stand.        
	I think the world should take note of these developments and then they will have to come to their own conclusions, PTI quoted S.M. Krishna as saying.        
	Security experts in India said the notice would restrict Saeeds movement. It brings international pressure on Pakistan to act because now he (Saeed) will not be allowed to go abroad. He will be deported or extradited to India if he goes abroad because of the red corner notice, former high commissioner to Pakistan G. Parthasarthy told the agency.        
	We hope that Pakistan, which claims to be at the forefront of the war on terrorism, will take note of it and arrest and proceed against him, added former Intelligence Bureau chief Ajit Doval.        
	But Parthasarthy said India had made a fundamental blunder in assuming that it could persuade Pakistan to either try him honestly there or extradite him here.        
	...We should have insisted that Americans should seek extradition of these masterminds. In my view, we have committed a serious blunder (by not doing so).        
	 More notices        
	Interpol today issued a red corner notice against Abu Hamza, another 26/11 suspect, according to PTI. It also issued blue corner notices (for collection of information about a persons identity) against 19 people, including Col R. Sadat Ullah of Pakistan, in connection with the terror strike.

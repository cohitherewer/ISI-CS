                                                                                                               Rebels kill two cops in Bastar
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Raipur, April 7: Naxalites blew up a bullet-proof vehicle at Bijapur in Bastar and killed two policemen in an ambush on a security convoy around 11am today.         
	Though at the spot during the attack, Bijapur superintendent of police Ankit Garg escaped unscathed as his vehicle crossed the site minutes before the blast. Rebels had targeted the district police chief, but missed, Deo told The Telegraph.         
	Constable Nand Kishore Sori died on the spot while constable Nohruram Netam succumbed to his injuries on his way to Bijapur hospital. Five personnel injured were rushed to Bijapur from where they were air-lifted to Raipur in the afternoon.        
	Senior police officers believe that the rebels mistook the bullet-proof vehicle to be the SPs vehicle.         
	Deputy inspector-general of police Pawan Deo said Garg, with escorting personnel, was on their way to Bhopalapatnam for a search operation when they were ambushed while passing through a mountain pass, some 5km from the Bijapur district headquarters.        
	Rebels detonated a landmine that blew up the bullet-proof pick-up van and the impact of the blast tore the vehicle into pieces. A 5-feet crater developed on the spot, where the suspected 20kg explosives were planted.

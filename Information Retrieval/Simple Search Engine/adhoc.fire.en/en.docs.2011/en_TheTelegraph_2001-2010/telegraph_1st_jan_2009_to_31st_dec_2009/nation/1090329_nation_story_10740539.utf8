The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Top cop, ex-minister under riot scanner
                                                                                                               Top cop, ex-minister under riot scanner
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Kodanani, arrested for allegedly leading rioters, at an Ahmedabad court. (AFP)                                  
	Ahmedabad, March 28: Former Ahmedabad police commissioner P.C. Pande and former Gujarat home minister Gordhan Zadaphia could be next in line to be arrested in connection with the 2002 riots, sources said today.        
	A day after state minister Maya Kodanani was arrested for allegedly leading rioters, sources said both Pande and Zadaphia were under the scanner of the Supreme Court-appointed special investigation team probing the violence.        
	Pande, now director-general of the state anti-corruption bureau, is to retire on March 31 after the Centre refused a state government request to grant him a years extension.        
	Sources said the SIT was likely to arrest Pande, chief minister Narendra Modis favourite officer, immediately after his retirement. Zadaphia, home minister during the riots, could be picked up later.        
	Either arrest would have serious implications for Modi though Zadaphia has left the BJP and floated the Mahagujarat Janata Party. The sources said if the SIT pursued the conspiracy angle in the riots, many other political bigwigs too would be in trouble.        
	Pande was Ahmedabad police chief in 2002 when a mob attacked Gulbarg Society in Meghaninagar, less than 2km from the police headquarters, and burnt former Congress MP Ehsan Jaffry alive with 38 others. Pande allegedly ignored frenzied calls from Jaffry for protection.        
	In January 2008, a month after he was re-elected chief minister, Modi had appointed Pande the state police chief. But last month, Modi sprang a surprise by replacing Pande with S.S. Khandwawala, a Muslim officer  perhaps in an effort at an image makeover.        
	Deputy superintendent of police K.G. Erda, posted at Meghaninagar as an inspector during the violence, has said he never received any instructions from his superiors to quell the rioting, the sources said. Erda was arrested by the SIT and is now on bail.         
	Zadaphia, the sources said, had been in touch with Jaideep Patel and other riot leaders. Patel has been arrested along with Kodanani. The sources said Zadaphias cellphone records could go against him.        
	Kodanani and Patel have apparently been implicated by their purported cellphone records, collected in the form of a CD by senior police officer Rahul Sharma. Although the state government has challenged the CDs authenticity, the SIT took its help to determine the duos location on the riots first day: February 28, 2002.        
	Gujarat High Court too took the CD into consideration while cancelling the anticipatory bail granted to them.        
	Lawyer Mukul Sinha, who has been representing the riot victims, said: Criminal negligence is a serious offence, which amounts to abetting the crime. Pandes inability to protect the life (of Jaffry and others) proves his culpability beyond doubt.        
	A rights group headed by Sinha has been urging the SIT to probe the conspiracy angle, saying the riots didnt seem a spontaneous reaction to the Godhra train fire of February 27, 2002.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP woos minnows, mouthpiece ridicules
                                                                                                               BJP woos minnows, mouthpiece ridicules
          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, May 12: The BJP has set its sights on regional parties to make up the shortfall in NDA numbers if it were to form the next government. The latest issue of party mouthpiece Kamal Sandesh has, however, made uncharitable remarks about these outfits.        
	The editorial says: Left parties have put themselves on sale and they are with political groups which make the highest bid in terms of political power. These power-hungry individuals and political parties have written the obituary for any ideology if ever they had one. In the epitaph they have written: We are with power and against everything else.        
	The Left is in the company of Jayalalithaas ADMK, Mayavatis BSP and Chandrababu Naidus TDP. The BJP managers have mentioned these parties as post-poll allies.        
	It describes only the BJP as a party with principles and ideology and appeals to voters: Election is the time when people need to teach a lesson to all these opportunistic political parties and politicians who mushroom like frogs in the election season.        
	The Kamal Sandesh, however, takes care not to name the ADMK and the TDP. It does not spare the BSP, though, and even makes a personal attack on Mayavati who could be the BJPs natural ally if Mulayam Singh Yadav drifts towards the Congress.        
	The editorial writes that Ram Vilas Paswan and Mayavati are neither Dalits nor well-wishers of Dalits.         
	With the ugly display of their wealth, people like Mayavati and Paswan are just proving that they are thriving in politics by trading the Dalits in the electoral bazaar without doing anything for them, it says.

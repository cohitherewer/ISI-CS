The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP sniffs unity
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BJP sniffs unity
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	New Delhi, Nov. 23: Atal Bihari Vajpayees reported indictment for his role in the Babri demolition has stunned the BJP, but it wouldnt have stalled Parliament even if the government did not table the Liberhan commission report in this session, party sources said.        
	Two senior MPs involved in drawing up the BJPs floor strategy said they were more inclined to raise issues that could unite the Opposition instead of dividing it and had the potential to embarrass the Congress-led UPA government.        
	Sources said the BJP was likely to take up former Jharkhand chief minister Madhu Kodas alleged scams when the House met tomorrow.        
	We dont want to be perceived as a single-issue party, a Lok Sabha MP said, explaining the reasons for going slow or at least appearing to go slow on the Liberhan report.        
	We feel price rise and corruption in UPA-II should get more attention than this (Liberhan) issue because these matters directly impinge on peoples lives. The Jharkhand elections begin on Wednesday. If we dont take up Kodas misdeeds, our voters will feel betrayed.        
	The MP said the other reason was that the BJP didnt want to squander the gains made when the Opposition coalesced to take on the government on the now rolled-back sugarcane ordinance.        
	The Samajwadi Party, for instance, has said it is willing to work with us on any matter that it is not communally divisive, the member added. Why should we lose its goodwill by harping on Ayodhya?        
	Sources said the party had also realised that the temple card had outlived its utility.        
	Some BJP sources were, however, thinking along another line: whether Advanis comment that he was proud to have been associated with the Ayodhya movement would have a positive impact on the RSS.        
	The Sangh has dropped enough hints that it would like Advani to step down as leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha.        
	Spokesperson Sushma Swaraj said the reports alleged leak was a ploy to disintegrate the Opposition. It is not an ordinary leak, it was done in a planned and motivated way. No other issue could have divided the Opposition, only the Liberhan report could have, she told reporters.        
	Sushma also accused the government of trying to divert attention from scams and the Congresss culpability in the cases that have embroiled Koda.        
	On Vajpayees reported indictment, Sushma said the former Prime Minister had been informed by party leaders that the matter would be taken up in the House.        
	We cannot live with this falsehood, she said.

          SUBRAT DAS                              
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 17: The month-long winter session of the Assembly, starting tomorrow, promises to be stormy.        
	Though the BJD had swept the April-May elections by winning 103 seats in the 147-member House and the strength of the main Opposition, Congress, went down considerably to 27, the ensuing session is expected to witness heated discussions on certain issues, including the multi-crore mining scam and growing incidents of farmer suicides.        
	We will not sit quiet when farmers are committing suicide one after another because of government apathy, said Opposition chief whip Prasad Harichandan.        
	The other major issues listed by the Opposition included the mining scam, deteriorating law and order, growing Maoist menace, recent death of two engineering students at Bolangir, power crisis, distress sale of paddy, failure of the government to utilise funds under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and pilferage of BPL rice.        
	The BJP, earlier a coalition partner of the BJD for nine years, is now a part of the Opposition. We will definitely expose the misdeeds and anti-people policies of the Naveen Patnaik government, said BJP legislature party leader K.V. Singhdeo.        
	A defensive BJD, on the other hand, is preparing to counter the Opposition attack. Naveen today asked party legislators to remain present in the House and effectively counter the Opposition attack. We are ready to discuss any issue raised by the Opposition, said Naveen.         
	Early funds sought        
	Orissa has requested the Centre for early release of the Rs 64.26-crore fund to carry out various tribal welfare activities in a bid to counter the increasing influence of Naxalites. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik has also requested the Centre to set up a tribal university in Kandhamal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Trinamul takes on Taliban Cong
                                                                                                               Trinamul takes on Taliban Cong
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                             
	Namsai (Lohit), Oct. 12: Zindabaad Trinamul, down with the Taliban Congress.        
	It seemed straight out of a Trinamul brawl Bengal is so used to, but Congress cadres replaced the comrades in this one last night in the high hills of poll-bound Arunachal Pradesh.        
	Trinamul and Congress workers clashed in Basar constituency in West Siang district, hours after campaigning stopped last evening under Election Commission rules.        
	Neither side unsheathed weapons but the brawl in Basar, 300km from Itanagar, was the latest between the two parties in the run-up to tomorrows elections.        
	Over 50 people were injured in a clash in Tezu, 450km from Itanagar, earlier this month, prompting authorities to clamp prohibitory orders. The violence broke out after a supporter of the Trinamul Congress, which has fielded nine Congress dissidents, tore off campaign posters of the Congress.        
	Trinamul Congress zindabaad, Dukter Basar zindabaad, shouted some 20-odd youths in Basar last night when confronted by rival candidate Gojen Gadis Congress workers.        
	Dukter , a former teacher at a school, is one of the four women candidates Mamata Banerjees Trinamul has fielded in this tribal-dominated segment.        
	I have not been able to campaign because of one group of Congress workers who call themselves the Taliban. I have complained but am not creating a ruckus, Dukter said.        
	Mamata and the Congress are allies in both Bengal and Delhi, but when individual battles are being fought here, there are no alliances.        
	Sources said anti-incumbency factors in the Congress-ruled state were working in Trinamuls favour, but Dukter said no senior party MP had visited any far-flung area so far.        
	Trinamul general secretary Mukul Roy had visited places close to the capital Itanagar, but that was it.        
	In Lohit district, in Arunachals east, huge posters of Mamata dot the streets. Trinamul candidate Chow Pinthika Namchoom is contesting against an Independent, Nang Sati Mein, who was earlier with the Congress.        
	Mein is considered a strong candidate as, ironically, the Congress candidate, Chow Chandra Mansai, is lying low for her to win.        
	Mamata faces a strong challenge here and, considering the districts reputation for violence during polls, Tuesday threatens to throw up some tense moments.         
	Trinamul, however, is getting the thumbs up from other parties.         
	I think Trinamul should win at least seven to eight seats, said state NCP president L. Wanglat, possibly keeping the doors open for a coalition government in case such a situation arises.         
	Asked if the NCP would support Dorjee Khandu if voters return a fractured verdict, Wanglat said the chief minister was a good man, but it takes a different kind of person to make a chief minister.        
	The Congress has not announced any name for the chief ministers post.

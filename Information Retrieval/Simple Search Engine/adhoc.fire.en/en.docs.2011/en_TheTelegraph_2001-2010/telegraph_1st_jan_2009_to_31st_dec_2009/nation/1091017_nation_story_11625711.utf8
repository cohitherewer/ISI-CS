The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rocks, not dinosaur eggs, say experts 
                                                                                                               Rocks, not dinosaur eggs, say experts 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chennai, Oct. 16: The clutch of supposed dinosaur eggs, recently unearthed by a team of scientists and plundered by locals in a Tamil Nadu village, have been found to be rocks.        
	A team led by Geological Survey of Indias director of palaeontology, D. Mohabey, after inspecting the site at Senthurai village in Ariyalur district, declared the eggs were actually sedimentary concretions formed over time.         
	Had they been eggs they would have been of the same size but these were in different sizes. Also the objects showed no morphological aspects that one would find in fossilised eggs, said V. Ganesan, a senior geologist of GSI, Chennai, who had inspected the site.        
	Mohabey had told the team of researchers from Periyar University, Salem, who had stumbled upon the find that though the site dug up by the local team showed no signs of a dinosaurs nest, the entire area would still be of geological importance as other interesting fossils had been discovered there in the past few decades.        
	M.U. Ramkumar, the head of geology at Periyar University, who led the team that discovered the eggs three weeks ago, was disappointed.         
	We have to accept the truth, being scientists and also because the GSI is the final authority on the matter. Anyway, Dr Mohabey has asked us to explore the 2sqkm site assuring us that a dinosaur nest was a distinct possibility since a dinosaur egg had been discovered in the cement mine at nearby Ariyalur, he said.        
	Asked how his team concluded that the spherical objects were dinosaur eggs without proper scientific backing, Ramkumar admitted that they were probably a bit over-enthusiastic. We should have waited for reports, he said.

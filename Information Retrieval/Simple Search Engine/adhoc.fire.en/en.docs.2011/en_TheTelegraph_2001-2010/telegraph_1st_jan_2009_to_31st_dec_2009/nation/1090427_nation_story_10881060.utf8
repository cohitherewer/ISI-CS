	Bhubaneswar, April 26: Seasonal fruits for elephants, coolers for chimpanzees, thermometers for white tigers  the Nandan Kanan management has pulled up all stops to ensure a comfortable summer for its inmates.        
	While Orissa burns with the mercury hovering around 40C and above, denizens of the premier zoo are facing a less tough time than the citizens. As they have iced water, new water sprays and sprinkling systems and tanks to combat heat. Also, a five-member special squad carrying anti-stress medicines, ice, glucose, and sprays have been doing rounds of enclosures to monitor the health of the animals during the stress hours (between 12pm and 3pm).        
	Our efforts have been rewarded. Previously, we did have sunstroke-related deaths in the zoo during summers. But this year not a single animal has died, said zoo director Ajit Pattnaik.        
	Thermometers have been fixed in lion safari feeding cubicles and in the white tiger safari feeding cubicles. The cubicles for squirrels, monkeys, chimpanzees and birds have also received new thermometers to keep a check. Seasonal fruits like watermelon, sugarcane and cucumbers are being supplied to elephants, bears and monkeys that lower body temperature, Pattnaik said.        
	Coolers have been installed in orang-utans, chimpanzees, squirrel and monkey enclosures, while the supply of water is being strictly monitored.         
	As many as 46 new water tanks have been constructed in the enclosures containing antelope, swamp, spotted and barking deer and in the cassowary and tiger safari kraal. The tanks have their water changed every day while old water tanks have been repaired.         
	Ice cold water is being supplied to leopards, squirrels monkeys, cassowary, emu and birds. Water sprays have been installed in birds enclosures.         
	Homes of cheetal, elephants, squirrels and monkeys have been thatched.         
	Birds, reptiles, carnivores, chimpanzees and orang-utans also have thatched homes now. Wallows have been dug for Sambar, wild pig, swamp deer and rhinos.

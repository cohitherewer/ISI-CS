The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Soni ire on governor
                                                                                                               Soni ire on governor
                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 21 (PTI): Union minister Ambika Soni has accused Punjab governor S.F. Rodrigues of levelling baseless allegations against her family over land allotment to run a public school in Chandigarh.        
	I find that he (Rodrigues) has no compunction of what is correct or otherwise and has lost no opportunity in levelling baseless and false accusations, the tourism minister said in a statement.        
	She said the land allotment to 22 entities to run schools seven years ago was already in the high court.        
	The governor seems to have spent his five years in office looking into this matter, while the issue continues in court, Soni said.        
	Rodrigues had pointed out serious irregularities in the land allotment to the Delhi Public School Society.         
	Sonis family is involved in the management of the DPS school.

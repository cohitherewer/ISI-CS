          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jamui (Bihar), April 15: Jamui administration is determined to not let red terror come in the way of election, despite rebels calling for a bandh in Jamui, Banka, Munger and Bhagalpur tomorrow.         
	The final hours to the polls were marked by flag marches, police and paramilitary force deployment, air surveillance by two Indian Air Force choppers and sealing of all entry and exits to the constituency today. While the administration has described the situation as under control, undercurrents of tension run in all the six Assembly segments with reports of a large number of outsiders being spotted in the constituency.         
	Arrangements were beefed up in rebel-hit pockets. Polling in three hyper-sensitive Assembly segments  Sikendara, Jhajha and Chakai  would start from 7am and continue till 3pm, while in Jamui, Tarapur and Sheikhpura, polling would conclude by 5pm, said district magistrate-cum-RO Pream Singh Meena. Maoist attacks usually take place in the second half, so this time formalities would be completed before evening, said a district official, and admitted that percentage of voters were expected to dip this time.         
	No major incident was reported from any part of the constituency, however, some posters and wall writings were spotted near Lakshmipur block office and at a JD(U) election office, a stones throw from the Lakshmipur police station.         
	Its just the lull before the storm, lets see what happens in the next 24 hours, said a district officer. Polling personnel deployed in remote parts of the constituency were frightened. Only God can save us, said many today, before proceeding to their destinations from Jamui district headquarters.         
	Binoy Kumar, the superintendent of police, said in sensitive areas special commandos from Punjab police have been deployed. Inside Jhajha Assembly segment, mount police have been deployed.        
	Nineteen candidates in the fray at Jamui, in which the crown might go to that candidate who would be special enough to make voters actually travel to the booth to cast the vote.

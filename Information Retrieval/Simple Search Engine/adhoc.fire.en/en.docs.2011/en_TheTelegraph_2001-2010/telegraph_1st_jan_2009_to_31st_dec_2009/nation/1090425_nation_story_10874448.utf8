The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | India joins deep ocean drillers
                                                                                                               India joins deep ocean drillers
          G.S. MUDUR                              
	New Delhi, April 24: India has joined an international effort to drill the ocean floor, providing the countrys scientists an unprecedented opportunity to join research expeditions to explore what lies beneath the ocean crust.         
	The earth sciences ministry has signed an agreement pledging Indian participation in the Integrated Ocean Drilling Programme (IODP), a research consortium launched five years ago that has now grown to 24 member nations.         
	The IODP is aimed at advancing scientific understanding of Earth through the study of material from deep under the ocean bed. The research will focus on climate change history, plate tectonics, and the deep ocean ecosystem.         
	Scientists from across the country will now have a chance to engage in deep ocean drilling, said Rasik Ravindra, director of the National Centre for Antarctic and Ocean Research in Goa (NCAOR). The ministry has assigned the institute the task of processing research proposals from Indian scientists keen on participating in the IODP expeditions.         
	Although India has oceanographic research vessels, they are not equipped to drill into the ocean floor. Weve been using tethered equipment to just grab sediment samples from the seabed without drilling, Ravindra told The Telegraph.         
	The scientific proposals will have to fit in with the objectives of the expeditions for scientists to get picked to join them, a scientist in the ministry said. India has pledged Rs 50 million per year to participate in the IODP until 2013.         
	Geophysicist Pawan Dewangan from the National Institute of Oceanography, Goa, is likely to be the first Indian scientist to participate in a drilling expedition after India, Australia and New Zealand joined the IODP earlier this month. The IODP is supported by two lead agencies  the US National Science Foundation and a Japanese agency.         
	Dewangan will fly to Hawaii next month where he will join a research vessel to sail into the eastern Pacific Ocean to study how material from under the ocean bed has changed over the past 65 million years. An NCAOR scientist will join another expedition later this year.         
	The IODP which is using three ocean drilling platforms  from the US, Japan and a consortium of European nations  this year has scheduled nine expeditions during 2009  in the Pacific, the mid-Atlantic, the Bering Sea, and in the waters off Japan, Australia and New Zealand, and Antarctica.         
	The data that IODP amasses, said Manik Talwani, president of the IODP Management International, may find applications in the future to predict geological events and identify and mitigate geo-hazards.

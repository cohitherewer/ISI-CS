The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Development fire on CM
                                                                                                               Development fire on CM
          OUR BUREAU       
	Calcutta, June 23: Senior Left Front ministers today turned a cabinet meeting stormy, accusing Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee of not doing enough for development in areas like Lalgarh, which led to the situation going out of our hands.        
	The chief ministers reply  that he had formed a task force a year ago to oversee development in tribal areas  met with cries of incredulity and scepticism.        
	Bhattacharjee said the government had spent Rs 13 crore towards tribal development since the committee was set up under the chairmanship of the chief secretary.        
	Several ministers, including some from the CPM, were immediately on their feet. Many said they had never heard of any such task force. So vociferous were the ministers that chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabartis elaboration on the job done by the task force was drowned out.        
	The so-called task force is only on paper. If it carries out development, why is there so much discontent among the tribals? a minister asked.        
	We dont know about the existence of any task force that was formed a year ago, West Bengal Socialist Party minister Kiranmoy Nanda said. Why was it formed? Was it because the government couldnt do anything on its own (for) the tribal people?        
	The RSPs Kshiti Goswami said: I too was unaware of the existence of any task force.        
	Bhattacharjee rejected his colleagues charges but admitted that more needed to be done. The concept of development is relative. We cant say there has been no development in the last 32 years in comparison with the state of affairs in the area earlier, he said.        
	The remote Sunderbans are also underdeveloped. But I want to assert that under-development is not the sole factor behind militant activity. The Khalistani movement swept Punjab when its per capita income was the highest in the country.        
	Leaders from the front allies who are outside the government too joined the attacks on the chief minister. RSP central committee member and former MP Manoj Bhattacharjee asked Bhattacharjee to apologise to the tribals for the lack of development.        
	The chief minister should invite the tribal community leaders at Midnapore and seek an apology for lack of development and the failure of the governments delivery mechanism. He should also seek pardon for the misdeeds of his party leaders like Anuj Pandey and Dalim Pandey who had amassed wealth by siphoning government funds, the RSP leader said.        
	Ban stand        
	CPM state secretary and front chairman Biman Bose endorsed the chief ministers stand on applying the central decision on banning the CPI (Maoist) but drew attention to the riders.         
	Since the (central decision) is applicable all over the country, Bengal cant be an exception. However, it is the state government which will decide when and how it would invoke the law here, Bose said.        
	Bose also tried to dispel the perception of divisions between the party and the government, pointing out that he had called for political as well as administrative efforts to fight the Maoists.        
	Home minister P. Chidambaram, while announcing the central ban yesterday, hoped aloud that the distinction between party and government is still there in this country.        
	At the state cabinet meeting today, ministers belonging to allies complained against the state governments stand when Bhattacharjee spoke about the necessity of implementing the central decision.        
	The RSPs Subhas Naskar, the CPIs Nandagopal Bhattacharya and Nanda rose to protest. Nanda convened a news conference at his Writers chamber after the cabinet meeting to complain that the chief minister had taken a unilateral decision.        
	However, the chief minister laid stress on tackling the Maoist problem from three angles  administrative, political and using development projects in tribal areas.

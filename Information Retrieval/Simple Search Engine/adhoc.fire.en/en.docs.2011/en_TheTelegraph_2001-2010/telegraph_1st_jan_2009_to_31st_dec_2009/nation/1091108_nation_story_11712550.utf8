          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Nov. 7: The Naveen Patnaik government is in a tight spot, again.        
	The government in a counter-affidavit apparently misled Orissa High Court by denying the knowledge of an official permission granted to Ram Bahadur Thakur Limited (RBT Llimited) to post security guards in Ruddukela and Katasahi manganese mines.         
	The grant came when RBT Limiteds application for a mine lease was still pending.         
	The state had placed a counter-affidavit, issued by additional secretary (steel and mines) Manoranjan Patnaik, to an PIL seeking CBI probe into the Rs 110-crore scam involving illegal mining and smuggling of manganese from the two mines in Keonjhar that had not been leased out.         
	The permission to post guards was given by R.N. Sahoo, the then director of mines (in-charge), based on the recommendation of M.M. Biswal, the former Joda deputy director of mines. This was not within the governments knowledge, it stated.         
	The counter-affidavit was submitted on November 3, 2009.        
	On July 30, 2009, while replying to a House question, industries, steel and mines minister Raghunath Mohanty had gone on record saying: In response to a request, an authorised representative of RBT Limited was allowed to post guards on August 30, 2008.        
	The firm had applied for manganese mining lease over 96.568 hectares in Ruddukela and Katasahi on September 25, 1991. The application is supposedly is under consideration.        
	The state had ordered an inquiry by the vigilance bureau after a scandal involving illegal mining and theft surfaced earlier this year.        
	While contending that a CBI investigation was not necessary, the state had further stated: The bureau is empowered and professionally competent to handle the case. Further, as seen from the action taken so far, the department is worthy of trust.        
	Vigilance in its interim report had concluded that According to conservative estimates, 52,376MT of ore was extracted illegally from the proposed lease area of RBT Ltd and adjacent forestland, at a cost of Rs 110 crore (approximately) at the average price of Rs 21,000 per MT. There is evidence that the above pits were excavated within the past two years.        
	The illegal mining was supposedly done by one Soumendra Narayan Das Mohapatra of Tulsipur area in Cuttack and Shakti Ranjan Das of Unit-II (Janpath) in Bhubaneswar who acted as RBT Limited representatives after receiving power of attorney.         
	No power of attorney in favour of S.N. Das Mohapatra is available on record, while the authenticity of the power of attorney claimed in favour of S.R. Das has been questioned.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Paddy shows promise, cane turns sour 
                                                                                                               Paddy shows promise, cane turns sour

	New Delhi, Sept. 9: Indias rainfall deficit has decreased in recent weeks, raising hopes of a recovery for paddy, but pearl millet, sugarcane and fodder yields will remain significantly depressed, weather and crop scientists said today.         
	The cumulative rainfall deficit in India was 20 per cent below normal yesterday, an improvement over a deficit of minus 23 per cent on September 2 and minus 29 per cent three weeks earlier, according to India Meteorological Department data.         
	Weve seen a steady improvement, said Ajit Tyagi, the director-general of the IMD. If the current and expected rain patterns persist through September, we could see an overall season deficit of between 15 per cent and 18 per cent. Such a deficit will be comparable with the most recent drought year of 2002 when the monsoon deficit was 19 per cent below normal.         
	While crop analysts had last month predicted 20 per cent lower yields for paddy in some parts of India, the rainfall over the past three weeks is likely to help paddy recover, said Laxman Singh Rathore, a senior agrometeorologist at the IMD.         
	We cannot quantify the loss in (paddy) yield with precision, but we now expect an improvement from earlier predictions, Rathore said. Theres been sizeable rainfall in eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, he said.         
	The area under paddy cultivation this year is about 30 million hectares compared to 36 million hectares at the same time during 2008, according to figures from the agricultural ministry released last week.         
	In the northwestern region  where the rainfall deficit is highest at 39 per cent below normal  farmers have had to resort to more frequent irrigation. The cost of production will rise, but productivity is unlikely to be affected significantly Rathore said.         
	But pearl millet, sorghum and maize are among crops likely to be affected by the rainfall deficit, he said. Across the entire Indo-Gangetic plains, the sugarcane crop has also come under severe water and temperature stress.         
	The water stress on pearl millet and maize is likely to severely affect fodder availability in some parts of India, Rathore said. But a senior scientist at the National Dairy Research Institute, Karnal, pointed out that fodder sources vary from place to place.         
	During the two-week-long extended weak spell that lasted from around July 25 to August 10, high temperatures in the sugarcane zones would have triggered certain biological changes in the plants that lead to intrinsic resistance to growth. In such situations, the availability of water later during the season is unlikely to make too much difference to the plants, Rathore said.         
	IMD director-general Tyagi said the Aila cyclone led to a cooling of the Bay of Bengal during June that prevented the crucial convection currents that drive the monsoon winds across the subcontinent.         
	India had experienced normal rainfall through much of July, but the two-week dry spell from July 25 contributed to a significant deficit during the second half of the monsoon.         
	Low pressure systems in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea that move towards the land also bring rain. During the last three months, only three such low pressure systems have moved in, instead of 7 to 10 during a typical monsoon season.

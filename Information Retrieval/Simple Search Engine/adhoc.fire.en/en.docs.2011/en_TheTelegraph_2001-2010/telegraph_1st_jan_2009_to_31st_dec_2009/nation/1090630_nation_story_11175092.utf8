The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pay heat on govt
                                                                                                               Pay heat on govt
                            
	Patna, June 29 (PTI): Members of the Bihar Legislative Council, cutting across party lines, today took the government to task for the delay in implementing the revised UGC pay scale to college and university teachers.        
	Raising the issue through a calling attention motion, Narendra Singh wished to know the deadline by which the pay scale would be implemented in Bihars colleges and universities.         
	Citing UGCs letter (dated February 28, 2009) to the state that suggested that the government implement the pay scale and enhance the superannuation age from 62 to 65 years, Singh reminded all that Bihar had adopted a resolution to implement both ideas in toto.        
	Responding to the query, HRD minister Hari Narayan Singh said: The government has received the UGC letter and another from the Union HRD ministry. The matter is also pending before Patna High Court.         
	Not satisfied, members of all parties, including ruling JD(U) and BJP, wanted an immediate assurance from the government and an announcement of the implementation.         
	However, Singh skirted the issue and said he could not announce the decision in the House, as there are procedures involved.         
	Congress member Mahachandra Singh and BJP member Ram Kishore Singh took umbrage of Singhs reply, while JD(U) member and deputy leader of the House Aslam Azad, BJP member Ram Kishore Singh and JD(U)s Vinod Kumar Choudhary said that they would not allow the House to function till the state announced the pay package. The council was, then, adjourned for 15 minutes. When the House re-assembled, acting chairman Arun Kumar intervened into the matter and asked the minister to set a time frame for the governments reply to the issue. The minister said he would inform the House within 10 days.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | One scorpion less on tobacco packets
                                                                                                               One scorpion less on tobacco packets
          UP IN SMOKEG.S. MUDUR                                             
	New Delhi, May 4: A government notice issued yesterday has reduced by half the size of the proposed pictorial warnings on packets of tobacco products and violated the code of conduct imposed by the Election Commission, health groups said today.         
	The health ministry notification said the warnings to be introduced from May 31 this year should occupy 40 per cent of the front panel of packets, altering earlier rules that had ordered warnings on 40 per cent of both the front and back panels.         
	This is an attempt to derail an important public health measure, said Monika Arora, the director of Hriday-Shan, a non-government organisation in New Delhi campaigning against tobacco for more than a decade.         
	Health activists point out that an earlier notification issued on March 15, 2008, had clearly specified that the pictorial warnings should appear on both the front and back panels of tobacco packets.         
	They suspect that the health ministry issued the May 3 notification under instructions from a group of ministers (GoM) that has been looking into the issue since 2007.         
	A senior health ministry official, who requested not to be named, declined to comment on the circumstances under which the new notification was issued yesterday, but said the bureaucracy had only followed instructions.         
	Health sector watchdogs had cautioned last month that a proposed GoM meeting on April 8 might have been called to further dilute rules governing pictorial warnings.         
	A GoM meeting in early 2008 had decided that tobacco packets need only display an image of a scorpion or human lungs instead of skull and crossbones as had been initially proposed by the health ministry.         
	Public health experts say they are disappointed by the new rules that at one point suggest that only the front panel of the tobacco packet should have a warning, but at another point define the principal display area as both front and back panels.         
	The new rules introduce an ambiguity that we believe may be used by industry for its own benefit, said Amit Yadav, a legal officer with Hriday-Shan.         
	I couldnt imagine anyone could stoop to levels where rules already agreed upon would be changed, said Prakash Gupta, the director of the Healis Sekhsaria Institute of Public Health in Mumbai.         
	We believe that this has been done now, specially keeping the polls in mind. The tobacco industry is very aggressive and has been lobbying for dilution of warnings, Gupta told The Telegraph.         
	Health activists say studies from Brazil have shown that warnings restricted on a single side of a packet prompts retailers to stack packs on the shelves in a way that hides the pictorial warnings from public view.

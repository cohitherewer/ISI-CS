The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | IPL boss gets poll reprieve
                                                                                                               IPL boss gets poll reprieve
  - Cricket body vote to be   held under earlier statute        OUR BUREAU                          Modi: In the fray                                              
	New Delhi/Jaipur, Feb. 20: The Supreme Court today directed the Rajasthan Cricket Association to hold elections to its executive committee on March 1 under its undisputed constitution that existed as on February 11, 2005.         
	The elections, earlier scheduled for February 22 this year, will be supervised by former Supreme Court judge N.M. Kasliwal, said a bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan. Nominations filed earlier, if any, will be recorded, the apex court clarified.         
	The order is seen as favourable for outgoing president Lalit Modi, who is locked in a bitter power struggle with association secretary Subhash Joshi.         
	Modi, the chief of the IPL, is also confronting a slew of cases relating to fraud and forgery. He has alleged a witch-hunt against him and threatened to move out IPL matches from Jaipur if the persecution does not end.        
	The decision is in our favour as the elections will be held under the constitution under which RCA has been functioning for the last four years. I am very happy about the decision as all illegalities and malpractices adopted for the February 22 polls would not be possible now, Modi told The Telegraph.        
	Till now, neither Modi nor any of his supporters had filed their nominations for the February 22 polls.         
	Confirming that he would be taking part in the elections on March 1, Modi said: Of course I would be contesting the polls. Till now, there was no need for me to file the nominations as the elections were a sham and a conspiracy to basically oust me.        
	Joshi, who claimed to have the backing of a majority of association members, had a new constitution registered with the state registrar of societies last month to vest more powers with the secretary rather than the president. He also called for elections on February 22 in defiance of Modi.         
	The tenure of the current executive committee ends on February 21.        
	The old constitution under which the polls will be held vests all powers in the president.         
	Advocate A.N. Gupta, who fought along with Modis counsel Abhishek Singhvi on behalf of the IPL boss in an earlier case, said: The elections under the constitution of February 11, 2005, means Modi retains absolute powers as president till the polls are held and his advice may be taken regarding the exercise. Upholding this constitution also means that the clause barring convicted persons from becoming RCA president no longer applies.         
	Sources said Modi did not disclose that he was once convicted of possessing drugs in the US, which would have become an obstacle had the new constitution been in place.        
	However, Modis rivals said the constitution would not matter as the polls would be held under the supervision of a retired judge. They claimed Modi wanted to defer the elections, in which he has not succeeded.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Antibiotic lesson from Venki
                                                                                                               Antibiotic lesson from Venki
          AMIT ROY                              
	Cambridge, Oct. 18: At his public lectures, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan often shows photographs of well-known people who have died young, including the mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan.        
	Like Venki Ramakrishnan, he came from Tamil Nadu (then Madras) and was also at Trinity College, Cambridge. The Nobel winner uses the mathematicians example to illustrate the practical implications of his own work on ribosomes, the molecular machines that make protein in cells.        
	He (Ramanujan) died when he was 33, Ramakrishnan says. These people all died in their 20s and 30s. They all died of infection that today wouldnt be a problem. And the point is that many antibiotics actually work by blocking protein production in bacteria  in other words they bind to the (bacterial) ribosome.        
	Ramakrishnan, 57, says scientists have a duty to explain their work, partly because so much of science in Britain and India is funded by the government and, therefore, the taxpayer. I think scientists often tend to isolate themselves and not engage with the public, he says.        
	He has talked about ribosomes at public lectures all over the world, including the US, India, New Zealand and Hong Kong, and on BBC programmes like Radio 4s Material World.        
	I find it hard work because you have to step outside your own normal way of thinking, he admits. (But) it is rewarding. Journalists may oversimplify it and scientists may use too much jargon or not explain it clearly enough. There is a challenge there for both sides.        
	When he comes to India, as he hopes to this winter, he will have to take the aam aadmi into confidence.        
	Listening to him, Indians will have a better understanding of why the antibiotic and many Indian doctors err on the side of over-prescribing  is a double-edged weapon.        
	He sets it out: Any antibiotic (for example erythromycin) that targets the ribosome will kill a broad range of bacteria. They wont just kill pathogenic (disease-causing) bacteria  this is a problem with antibiotics in general. There are limited ways to target only pathogenic bacteria  that is why when we take antibiotics we often disturb our gut. We may get diarrhoea because our intestinal bacteria which are good are being killed off at the same time as the bad.        
	So, when Ramakrishnan cycles to work every morning, his research does very directly affect the average Indian popping into his nearest pharmacy with yet another doctors prescription.        
	Ramakrishnan sees his Nobel not as an end but as a beginning. I think in a way this prize could give you the credibility to tackle even harder things you want to do, he says.        
	He hopes his best work is yet to come. Many Nobel laureates have gone on to have very productive careers and, if you look at people like (Hargobind) Khorana, after he won the Nobel Prize (in physiology/medicine in 1968) he did the first artificial synthesis of the gene.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Land poses major hurdle
                                                                                                               Land poses major hurdle
          SUBRAT DAS      
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 5: The proposed 12 million-tonne-per-annum (MTPA) greenfield steel plant of ArcelorMittal in the state has made little headway even as the Orissa government today denied receiving any communication from the worlds largest steel maker about its reported pullout plan.        
	According to sources in the state industry department, the UK-based company has so far invested a meagre Rs 25 crore for land acquisition-related activities against the total project cost of Rs 40,000 crore.        
	While the state government claims that the land acquisition is almost done, the process has been delayed due to agitation by the displaced families under the banner of Mittal Pratirodh Manch claiming that most of the land was fertile, irrigated agricultural land.        
	The state government, which had committed to provide 8,000 acres for the proposed steel plant during signing of the MoU on December 21, 2006, has not yet been able to acquire a single acre.        
	Land has been identified in 15 villages under Patna tehsil of Keonjhar district for establishment of the steel plant and civil township. Of the total land requirement of 8,000 acres, the major chunk (4,905.213 acres) belongs to private persons, while 2,847.282 acres are owned by the government and the rest 754.688 acres are forestland.        
	Industries, steel and mines minister Raghunath Mohanty said land acquisition was delayed because of elaborate official procedures prescribed under the Orissa Land Acquisition Act. However, the process is at an advanced stage of completion, he said.         
	Financial Times has quoted ArcelorMittal chairman and CEO L.N. Mittal as saying his company may pull out of its plan to set up greenfield steel projects in Jharkhand and Orissa and look for alternative sites if land acquisition problems were not resolved soon.        
	However, chief minister Naveen Patnaik today told reporters here that he had not received any communication from ArcelorMittal. I have no information about the pullout plan from the company, he said.        
	They are very positive about their plan, said Naveen, adding that the land acquisition activities for the proposed mega steel plant project were on.        
	During a review of mega projects a fortnight ago, Mohanty had sought clarifications from Sanak Mishra, ArcelorMittals project chief in India, on the media reports about the companys going slow plan on the Orissa project.         
	Mishra had clarified that ArcelorMittal was committed to its Orissa project.

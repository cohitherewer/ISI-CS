The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Raje out, Lalit faces the heat
                                                                                                               Raje out, Lalit faces the heat
          RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR                          Lalit Modi                                  
	Jaipur, Jan 23: The Congress government in Rajasthan has formed a committee to probe property deals, including one involving cricket official Lalit Modi, struck during the erstwhile Vasundhara Raje regime.        
	The cumulative value of the contracts that will be probed adds up to Rs 22,000 crore.        
	One of the deals that will be investigated will be the one that gave the Modi-headed Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) the right to lease out the popular Sawai Mansingh Stadium, the venue of many Indian Premier League (IPL) matches last year, government sources said. The proximity of Modi to Raje could also come under the scanner.        
	The panel will look into charges of corruption, misconduct, negligence, fraud, abuse of power and loss to exchequer during Rajes tenure.        
	Retired judge N.N. Mathur will head the committee. Former IAS officers Inderjeet Khanna and H.N. Meena are the other members.         
	They have been asked to submit their report within six months. Modi is also accused of ousting the long-standing Rungta family from the RCA to become the most influential figure in the cricket body amid allegations he could do so as he was close to Raje.        
	During his campaign for the Assembly elections last December, chief minister Ashok Gehlot had raised several questions on the reported closeness between Raje and Modi.         
	 Late tonight, Kishore Rungta welcomed the probe. All corruption charges (against Modi) should be probed, including the signing of the MoU between RCA and the government over the leasing of the Sawai Mansingh Stadium.         
	However, Modi told The Telegraph: There is absolutely nothing to comment on the probe ordered against the deals during the BJP regime. What have I got to do with it?        
	He added: Also no comments on the MoU signed between SMS stadium and RCA. Let the investigations begin.        
	Gehlot may review the RCAs pact with the stadium himself. Already, and Republic Day celebrations this time will be held at the stadium. The Congress had opposed Rajes decision to move such government programmes to other venues across the state.

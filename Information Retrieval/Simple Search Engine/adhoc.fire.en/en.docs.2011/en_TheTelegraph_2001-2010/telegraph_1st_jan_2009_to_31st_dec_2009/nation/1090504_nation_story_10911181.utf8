          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, May 3: The Liberated Childhood Movement (LCM) today said there was an urgent need to address the abysmal conditions as far as enforcement of child labour prohibition laws and regulations in Orissa was concerned.        
	The body has been investigating the implementation of Child Labour (Prohibition and Protection) Act, 1986 in Orissa from 1997. There is no doubt that child labour is burgeoning into a major problem in Orissa with woefully ineffective state and court action being taken in the past decade. Issues like sufferings of child labourers and denial of their rights also need to be addressed immediately, LCM chairperson Bikash Das said.         
	When the state does file a case in court, the government is defeated time after time, or the cases remain pending.         
	An LCM survey found there was virtually no administrative mechanism in place to enforce rules and alleviate child labour. In Angul, Bargarh, Balasore, Bolangir, Boudh, Deogarh, Dhenkanal, Jharsuguda, Keonjhar, Malkangiri, Nayagarh and Puri districts, 3,381 inspections in the past decade threw up 436 cases. But only seven of those guilty were punished, Das said.         
	State labour and employment officials, however, said that field functionaries had been instructed to inspect roadside dhabas, hotels and tea stalls to rescue child labourers and file cases against defaulting employers. More than 1,000 inspections had been made in 2008 and 800 child labourers detected. While 300 were released, some were sent back to their parents, said under secretary in labour and employment department Pravakar Mallick.

	Bhubaneswar/Jajpur, Feb. 15: The arterial Howrah-Chennei route, blocked following the derailment of the Coromandel Express at Jajpur on Friday night, was opened for traffic today.        
	The services were resumed by noon with a massive restoration operation being launched. The restoration work was done on war-footing. We completed it within 36 hours, which otherwise would have taken more than 60 to 70 hours, East Coast Railway official Nirakar Das said.        
	The New Delhi-Puri Neelachal Express was the first train to run on this section after restoration of the tracks. Direct supervision of top officials, massive deployment of manpower and sophisticated machines and co-operation of local villagers were the reasons for quick restoration, a railway official said. Three cranes and more than 1,000 personnel were pressed into service to clear the wreckage and put the damaged tracks back in shape.        
	The Howrah-Secunderabad Falaknuma Express, Howrah-Hyderabad East Coast Express and Howrah-Chennai Coromandel Express would ply on their normal routes.        
	Of the nine casualties, three bodies are yet to be identified. The bodies have been kept in the morgue at SCB Medical College Cuttack and would remain there for two more days. At least 44 injured people had been shifted to the medical college out of whom 24 were discharged.        
	Meanwhile, the railway officials suspect that a technical glitch in the engine of the train had caused the accident, after drawing a blank despite an inch-by-inch inspection of the tracks in the area.        
	After visiting the spot for two days, commissioner (railways safety) Baldev Singh could not point out anything specific that might have led to the incident. Instead, he asked senior railway officials to thoroughly examine the engine of the 24-coach train.        
	East Coast Railway general manager A.K. Goyel had also been camping at the site since Friday night. He conducted a preliminary investigation and could find no proof that the accident had been caused because of problems with the tracks or the signalling system. We have found nothing wrong with the tracks and there was no question of signalling error, said Goyel.

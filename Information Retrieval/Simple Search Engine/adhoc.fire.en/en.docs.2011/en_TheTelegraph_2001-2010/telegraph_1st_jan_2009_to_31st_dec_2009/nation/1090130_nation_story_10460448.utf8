The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Malegaon scan on Ram Sena chief
                                                                                                               Malegaon scan on Ram Sena chief
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mutalik at court. (AFP)                                  
	Mumbai, Jan. 29: The Maharashtra anti-terror squad will question Ram Sena chief Pramod Mutalik, arrested over Saturdays assault on young girls in a Mangalore pub, for possible links with the September blasts in Malegaon, senior police officials said.        
	A three-member team headed by an assistant commissioner of police will soon leave for Mangalore to question Mutalik, who justified the attack as a protest against growing pub culture.        
	Television pictures showed several women being whisked out of the pub and beaten by a group of Ram Sena activists.         
	Asked about Mutaliks possible link with the Malegaon case, additional director-general K.P. Raghuvanshi, who heads the Maharashtra ATS, said: We came to know about Mutaliks speech where he praised accused sadhvi Pragya Singh and said such sadhvis should be born in every house. We want to verify it and see if there is a possible connection.        
	The ATS is also probing Mutaliks possible link with blast mastermind Prasad Purohit based on an intercept of a telephone conversation in which the sacked army official made a passing reference to the Ram Sena chief. The 4,528-page chargesheet mentions this reference.         
	Purohit claims that he met Mutalik in Pune and was impressed by his work and dedication. He also mentions that Mutalik was the Bajrang Dal chief for Karnataka, but was removed following differences with the Sangh parivar outfit.        
	He then formed the Hindu Rashtra Sena and the Sri Ram Sena, Purohit is quoted as saying in Hindi. The transcript, however, does not mention Mutaliks first name.        
	The ATS chargesheet also mentions another Mutalik in its list of three absconders. The chargesheet names one Pravin Mutalik, a resident of Gokak in Belgaum district of Karnataka, as an absconder in the Malegaon case.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Glitch-hit, CAT extended by a day
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Glitch-hit, CAT extended by a day
  - Facing flak from students, IIMs keep pen-and-paper exam option open          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Two IIM aspirants in Calcutta who could not take the CAT because of a technical glitch. Around 180 aspirants have suffered in the city                                        
	New Delhi, Dec. 4: The IIMs have extended their first computerised entrance examination by a day to accommodate candidates who could not take the test at the scheduled slots because of technical glitches, but are not ruling out a pen-and-paper retest.         
	The B-schools and testing service provider Prometric today announced that the 10-day computerised Common Admission Test (CAT) would be extended by a day  from its scheduled last day of December 7 to December 8.         
	But the institutes  facing flak from students for failing to insulate them from repeated glitches that have plagued the test  are keeping the option of a pen-and-paper retest open, IIM sources said.         
	Over 8,000 candidates could not attempt or complete the CAT and have been formally communicated slots for Monday and Tuesday.         
	But several others have complained of problems they faced while appearing for the test, which they claim made the examination unfair.         
	Several students have complained that their test was wrongly submitted before they had completed it.         
	Others have complained about being made to wait several hours before their exam started  without even a toilet break. This, the students argue, placed them at a disadvantage compared with candidates at centres where the tests began on time.         
	Students have also complained that chaos at their centre during the test  because of complaints from other students  made it hard for them to concentrate.         
	Coaching centres have claimed that some of the students had told them that questions had been repeated over subsequent days. Friends who took the test earlier told them about the questions they were asked, placing those who took the test on later days at an advantage.         
	Glitches have been reported on all the seven days of the test, including Friday, though the frequency of complaints has gone down after the first four days.         
	The IIMs have created a fallback plan  to scrap the computerised test, even mid-way if necessary, and re-conduct a pen-and-paper test for this year.         
	The reduced frequency of complaints over the past three days has emboldened the IIMs and Prometric to try and complete the computerised test that started on November 28.         
	IIM officials said they feared that a number of candidates affected by the glitches could approach courts seeking a fair attempt at the exam and necessitating a pen-and-paper test.

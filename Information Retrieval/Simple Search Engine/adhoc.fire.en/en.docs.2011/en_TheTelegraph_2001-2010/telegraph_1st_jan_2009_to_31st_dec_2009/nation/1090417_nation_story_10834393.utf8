	Patna, April 16: Incidents of violence, including a case of police firing and an attack on polling personnel, marked the first phase of election in 13 Lok Sabha constituencies spread across the north and south of the Ganga in Bihar today.         
	About 46 per cent voters exercised their right to franchise in what the poll administration described as relatively peaceful polls. The administrations claim does not appear to be off the mark, as the state registered large number of casualties throughout the nineties and early 2000.         
	In 2000, in the first phase of polling, 22 persons, including 14 security men, were killed. In the 2004 Lok Sabha poll the casualty figure stayed below 10 during the entire poll.         
	Today, a Gaya constable and a Home Guard jawan were killed in a Maoist gun battle.        
	However, it may be too early to predict the over all poll trend and if its stands completely reversed for Bihar  yet to undergo three more phases.         
	But, voters themselves stressed that the introduction of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs), deployment of paramilitary forces and empowerment of voters could make this years elections more peaceful than before.         
	Naxalites executed landmine blasts at Simultala and Jhajha-Narganjo road in Jamui Lok Sabha constituency injuring Jamui district JD(U) president Shambhu Sharan and three supporters.         
	The police opened fire on the mischief-makers and rebels trying to disrupt polling at Korieri, Sheikhapur (Sasaram), Sono (Jamui) and Rasulpur (Maharajganj). However, no casualty was reported.        
	However, in the scuffle between trouble-makers and police EVMs at Rasulpur were damaged, compelling forces to open fire on the men to chase them out.         
	Security personnel also arrested 300 persons for creating trouble across 13 constituencies.         
	The Lok Sabha constituencies that went to the polls today included Gopalganj, Siwan, Maharajganj, Saran (all north of Ganga), Buxar, Karakat, Arra, Aurangabad, Sasaram, Gaya, Jehanabad, Jamui and Nawada (south of Ganga). People boycotted election in as many as seven stations in the rebel-hit Jamui and Sasaram constituencies.

	Mumbai, June 30: Mumbai may soon have helicopters hovering on its horizon, carrying out surveillance and assisting police in anti-terror and other emergency operations, like in New York and London.        
	Union home minister P. Chidambaram made the promise today at the launch of the first of the four regional hubs of the elite National Security Guards (NSG) in Mumbai, seven months after the November 26 terror attacks.         
	There are plans to provide helicopters for megacity policing. When the project is complete, megacities will have helicopters, he said.         
	The NSG commandos have been provided a temporary base at the Kalina police headquarters till November when construction at the plot allotted by the state in Andheri will be completed.

	New Delhi, June 6: Health authorities have detected the first signal in India of local transmission of the new H1N1 influenza virus with a 28-year-old man who had arrived in Hyderabad from the US passing on the infection to his brother.        
	Officials said the local transmission was not unexpected given the behaviour of the virus elsewhere in the world. But, they added, there was no evidence yet of a cluster of cases that would call for putting in place tough area containment measures.        
	The man who had arrived from the US on a British Airways flight on May 31 reported to a public health facility with fever, cold and sore throat on June 2.        
	Health officials believe the man had no symptoms when he arrived but was possibly shedding the virus, which infected his brother, who was admitted to a government chest hospital in Hyderabad.        
	Two co-passengers  a 31-year-old woman and her four-year-old daughter  who were on the same flight also tested positive for H1N1 today.        
	The cumulative number of H1N1 cases in India has climbed to eight since the virus surfaced in the country on May 16. But all patients have so far had mild illness with none of them showing (potentially serious) lower respiratory disease, an official said.        
	All the patients confirmed with H1N1 have been treated with the anti-viral drug oseltamivir.        
	The local transmission in Hyderabad has, however, prompted an investigation into the situation. Were watching the city.... Our response will depend on how the outbreak evolves in the coming days, a senior medical official said.         
	A team of specialists from Delhi reached the Andhra Pradesh capital this morning.        
	We are reviewing the situation in consultation with the central team of experts and we will take all necessary steps to contain the spread of the virus, state health secretary L.V. Subramanyam said after talks with the central experts.        
	The virus, which has the potential to trigger a global pandemic, has spread to 69 countries, infected more than 21,000 people, and killed 125 since it was detected in Mexico more than six weeks ago. But 103 of the deaths were in Mexico alone.        
	Surveillance officers across India have been asked to look for clusters  the spread of the virus from one person to three or more contacts  which would mean rapid local spread.        
	The detection of a cluster might lead health authorities to recommend special measures such as quarantining of neighbourhoods surrounding the clusters, shutdown of markets and schools in the areas, and other steps aimed at social distancing, an official said. But we are not at that point yet, the official added.        
	The local transmission to a family contact is not surprising, but it is still not clear how efficiently this virus will spread in India, Vishwa Mohan Katoch, the director-general of the Indian Council of Medical Research, said.        
	The efficiency of the spread of a virus can be influenced by local factors such as weather and natural immunity from other infections that a population may have experienced in the past, Katoch said.

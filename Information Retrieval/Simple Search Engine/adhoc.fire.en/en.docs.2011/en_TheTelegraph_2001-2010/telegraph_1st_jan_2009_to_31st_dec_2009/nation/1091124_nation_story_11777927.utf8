The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Teacher poll duty bar not absolute
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Teacher poll duty bar not absolute
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 23: The Supreme Court today clarified that its earlier ruling restraining governments from deploying teachers for non-teaching work, including poll duty, was not absolute.        
	We had said as far as possible, ordinarily teachers would not be used for non-teaching work on teaching days and hours. If there are no other officers in a remote area, how will the Election Commission conduct elections (without involving teachers)? a bench headed by Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan said.         
	The court dismissed an appeal by an NGO filed after Gauhati High Court refused to stop frequent deployment of teachers in government and government-aided schools for non-teaching duties.        
	The Barak Human Rights Protection Committee, a body of teachers and guardians of children in government and government-aided schools, professionals and others, had alleged that the practice was disrupting the academic schedule of these schools. The NGO had adduced evidence to show that most of these institutions were single-teacher schools with a large number of students.        
	The petition pointed out that the state had been deputing teachers for pulse polio drives, malaria eradication efforts, census operations, preparation of voters list and other election-related work.        
	The petition also alleged that no such duties were assigned to teachers of private schools, which catered to the upper strata of society and urban areas. As a result, teachers in schools run or aided by the government were absent for days, even months, leading to unfinished syllabi and poor student scores, the PIL contended.

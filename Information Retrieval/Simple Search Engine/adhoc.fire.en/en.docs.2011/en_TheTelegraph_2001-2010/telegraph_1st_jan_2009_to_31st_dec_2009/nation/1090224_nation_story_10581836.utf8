          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Drugs dumped in the Mahanadi. Telegraph picture                                  
	Cuttack, Feb. 23: Eighteen months after a fake medicine scam rocked Orissa, the state apparently continues to be a flourishing market for sub-standard and spurious drugs, thanks to a lackadaisical government.        
	The drug racket was busted in western Orissas Kantabanji area in Bolangir in July 2007, but a larger gang is suspected to be continuing business in the heart of Cuttack.         
	During confidential inquiry, it is learnt that the spurious drugs trade originates from wholesalers in Cuttack, said a vigilance department report, indicating the role of four distributors  all located in Manikghosh Bazaar here.        
	Admitting that around 131 drugs available in the market had to be declared either sub-standard or spurious, acting drugs controller Gangadhar Das Mohapatra said all measures were taken to curb the clandestine trade.         
	However, there was not very much the drugs control department could do since only 24 drugs inspectors were there for all the 30 districts, he pleaded.         
	One initiative of the government since the Kantabanji case in July 2007 was increasing the number of post of drugs inspectors to 40. But only four have been appointed till date.         
	The drugs control department had conducted 1,677 raids in eight months between July 2007 and March 2008 and collected 4,350 samples, but seems to have lost out on checking the menace later.        
	They deal in spurious stuff, involving protein powder, morphine, anti-snake venom, and anti-cancer drugs, added the report, of which Orissa High Court took judicial note on January 15.        
	That the enforcement work was losing its steam is evident from the marked decline in number of raids between April and December 2008. During the eight months, only 110 raids were conducted and 253 samples were drawn, said advocate Gokulananda Patnaik, who is battling out a PIL on the fake medicine and spurious drug menace in the high court.        
	No raids or samples were drawn after December 2008, which is evident from an affidavit submitted in the high court last week by the acting drugs controller, he said.        
	The high court had on January 15 asked the state government to submit an action-taken report on the vigilance departments report. Its no wonder that the division judge bench of Chief Justice B.S. Chauhan and Justice Indrajit Mohanty expressed dissatisfaction over the governments approach, Patnaik added.        
	The state vigilance, in its inquiry report, observed: The corrupt officials of the state health department, responsible for purchase and storage of drugs in crores, are suspected to be hand in glove with manufacturers.         
	In most cases, spurious drugs circulation is carried out with the knowledge and connivance of officials of the drug controller, and local drug inspectors who are in the payroll of unscrupulous dealers, the report said, confirming circulation of huge amount of fake medicines in the markets across the state vis--vis a spurious drug trade.

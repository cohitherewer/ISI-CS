          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, May 14: Wear your seatbelts, get a green card.         
	Four-wheel drivers in Bhubaneswar were in for a pleasant surprise today after top film stars stopped them at major crossings of the city offering them coloured cards  red and green.        
	While the green cards were for those who had their seatbelts on, the red were for those who had broken traffic rules.         
	After roses and rakhis, coloured cards have been the latest addition to the list of innovative methods being implemented by the police commissionerate to instil a traffic sense among residents. And they have roped in celebrities and filmstars in town to help them in their mission.         
	Walking across several important squares of the city this morning, actors  including Uttam Mohanty, Bijay Mohanty and Kajal, celebrities and cricket stars stopped four-wheelers to check if drivers had worn their seatbelts.         
	I will surely use the seatbelt from now, said Pabitra Mohanty, whose car was stopped at AG square. Mohanty was given a red card by actress Kajal.         
	Pradeep Senapati, another commuter, had the same experience. I did feel a little embarrassed, but on the whole it was a memorable experience. Henceforth, every time Im sitting behind the wheels I am going to wear my seatbelts, he said. Official figures show that road accidents claim at least 15 lives everyday in Orissa. There are some offenders who refuse to follow the rules despite being fined several times. That is why we thought of this model, said assistant commissioner of police (traffic) Nirmal Satpathy.        
	The police commissionerate has already collected Rs 1,20,59,240 as fine from 1,09,170 violators in the twin cities in a year. However, our aim has never been collecting money. That is why we resort to innovative drives that help reach out to those who refuse to follow the rules, he said.

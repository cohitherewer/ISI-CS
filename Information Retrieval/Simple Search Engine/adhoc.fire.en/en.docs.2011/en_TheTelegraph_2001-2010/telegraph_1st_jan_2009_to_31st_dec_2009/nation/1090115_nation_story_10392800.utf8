The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PW: Dont rely on our opinion on Satyam
                                                                                                               PW: Dont rely on our opinion on Satyam
                            
	The letter Price Waterhouse sent to the new board of Satyam Computer Services on January 13, 2009. The letter is being reproduced verbatim.              
	Dear Sirs         
	Re: Our audit of your financial statements        
	1. As statutory auditors, we performed audits of Satyam Computer Services Limited (the Company) from the quarter ended June 2000 until the quarter ended September 30, 2008 (Audit Period).         
	2. The above-referred financial statements were prepared by the management of the Company.         
	3. We planned and performed the required audit procedures on such financial statements, and examined the books and records of the Company produced before us by the Company management. We placed reliance on management controls over financial reporting, and the information and explanations provided by the management, as also the verbal and written representations made to us during the course of our audits.         
	4. As you are aware, vide a letter dated January 7, 2009 (Chairmans Letter) addressed to the erstwhile Board of Directors of the Company, the former Chairman of the Company, Mr. Ramalinga Raju has stated that the financial statements of the Company have been inaccurate for successive years. The contents of the said letter, even if partially accurate, may have a material effect (which effect is currently unknown and cannot be quantified without a thorough investigation) on the veracity of the Companys financial statements presented to us during the Audit Period. Consequently, our opinions on the financial statements may be rendered inaccurate and unreliable. A copy of the Chairmans Letter, extracted from the official website of the National Stock Exchange is annexed hereto as Annexure A, for the sake of record.         
	5. The ICAI has issued a guidance note on revision of audit reports in January 2003 (Guidance Note) which prescribes steps to be followed by the auditor to prevent reliance on audit reports in such circumstances. In view of the contents of the Chairmans Letter, we hereby, in accordance with the Guidance Note, state that our audit reports and opinions in relation to the financial statements for the Audit Period should no longer be relied upon.         
	6. Such a requirement is also prescribed under the generally accepted accounting standards in the United States, where, as you are aware, the American Depository Receipts of the Company are listed. We wish to inform you that pursuant to Section 10A of the United States Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, the information contained in the Chairmans Letter indicates that an illegal act could have occurred. Accordingly, we advise that the Board of Directors of the Company should promptly commence an independent investigation pursuant to Section 10A of the United States Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 in order to determine whether such illegal acts occurred and, if so, the nature and extent of such acts.         
	7. We hope to work with the Company and provide assistance to the new Board of Directors to address any issues that arise in the course of such investigation, to enable both the Company and us as your statutory auditors to fulfill obligations under applicable law.         
	8. We wish to advise that the Company should promptly notify any person or entity that is known to be relying upon or is likely to rely upon our audit report that our audit opinion should no longer be relied upon.         
	9. Consequently, such notification should be made to at least the Companys shareholders, lenders, creditors, Indian regulatory authorities and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, and indeed to all stock exchanges, whether in India or abroad, where the securities of the Company are listed. We expect such notification would be made promptly and request that the Company advise us as soon as the notification has been made. Since we are required under the Guidance Note to mark a copy of this letter to the relevant regulatory authorities, we have done so.         
	Yours faithfully,         
	For and on behalf of Price Waterhouse

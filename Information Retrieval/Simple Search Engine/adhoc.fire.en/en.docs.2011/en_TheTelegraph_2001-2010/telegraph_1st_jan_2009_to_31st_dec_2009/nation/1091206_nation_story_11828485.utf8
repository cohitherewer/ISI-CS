                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Hurriyat renews talks pledge after Qureshi attack

	Srinagar, Dec. 5: Hurriyat doves today pledged to pursue a dialogue with Delhi hours after a suspected militant attack on a top moderate leader underlined the threat from radicals opposed to talks.        
	As Fazal Haq Qureshi battled for his life in hospital after last evenings shooting, Hurriyat chief Mirwaiz Umar Farooq said the pro-talks faction would not be cowed down.        
	We will continue to pursue the path of dialogue to bring about a solution to the Kashmir issue. There will be a dialogue with India and with Pakistan because this is the only way to resolve the issue, he said. Some elements do not want the Kashmir issue resolved because their shops will be shut.        
	Qureshi, 64, shot at after returning from a mosque, continues to be critical with substantial damage to his brain. He was operated on for two hours last night and shifted to the intensive care unit where he has been put on a ventilator.        
	He is the fourth separatist leader after Mirwaiz Mohammad Farooq (Umars father), Qazi Nissar and Abdul Ghani Lone to have become a target of suspected militants. The first three lost their lives.        
	Kashmir observed a shutdown today and protests broke out in parts of Srinagar against the attack. The protesters, however, refrained from blaming the militants and shouted pro-independence slogans instead. Near Hawal, youths threw stones at the security forces, the clashes continuing for several hours.        
	Qureshi was part of a Hurriyat team that held two rounds of talks with L.K. Advani when he was Deputy Prime Minister in the NDA government. The militant leader had turned peacenik in 2000 and played a key role as interlocutor in talks between the Hizb-ul Mujahideen and the Centre.        
	The moderate Hurriyat faction faces opposition both from the hardliners led by Syed Ali Shah Geelani and the militants. Geelani, though, tried to dispel the notion that he had any hand in the attack by visiting the hospital and the home of Qureshi. He described the attack as a cowardly act.        
	Although the Hurriyat put up a brave face, both government and separatist circles are worried that the loud claims being made about the quiet talks had provoked the attack.        
	Chief Minister Omar Abdullah publicly expressed displeasure at the publicity surrounding the talks.        
	The biggest problem is there is too much talk about the quiet talks. Quiet talks should remain quiet. That is why I am not talking about talks but the peace process. It is important that the peace process continues regardless of shape or manner, he said.         
	Omar said he would meet Union home minister P. Chidambaram on Monday to take stock of the situation in the light of the attack on Qureshi.        
	He said he realised that when the dialogue process began, the moderate separatists would be in some danger.        
	We had offered him (Qureshi) security but he declined. I have told my officers that if there is any weakness in their security, they should plug it, he said.        
	Omar said the talks between separatists and Delhi were yet to take off. So far what you have is in the realm of speculation. There is progress in creating an atmosphere. How much of that has happened, what is proposed to be happening, is not best to be talked about at this moment.

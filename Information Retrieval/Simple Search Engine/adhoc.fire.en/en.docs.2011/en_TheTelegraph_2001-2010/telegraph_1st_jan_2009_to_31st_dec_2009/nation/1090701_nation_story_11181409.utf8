          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Ahmedabad, June 30: A Gujarat bus driver has killed himself, unable to bear the guilt of an alleged offence that is part and parcel of everyday life but does not attract severe punishment: death caused by road accident.        
	Seven persons were killed when the bus Dhirubhai Makwana, an employee of Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation, was driving collided with a car in Anand on Saturday.        
	Makwana had fled to his native village of Mota Kalodar after the bus hit the multi-utility vehicle (MUV) on the Tarapur-Vataman road in Anand district, 80km from Ahmedabad. The seven victims were from two families; the only one to survive was the cars driver.        
	Makwana, who left behind a suicide note addressed to police, went home and took poison as he was overwhelmed by guilt. The 50-year-old man had been driving state buses for the past 25 years and had an unblemished record.        
	Tarapur police inspector S.K. Solanki said Makwanas body, which was lying in a field, was spotted by a villager on Sunday morning.        
	J.K. Solanki, the divisional traffic officer of Nadiad, where the bus was logged, said Makwana had not met anyone after the accident. He neither informed the bus depot nor spoke to any of his colleagues or relatives, Solanki said.        
	The officer said Makwana may have fled from the site of the accident fearing he would be beaten up by local residents.         
	Since he did not speak to anyone, the only clue to what may have been going through his mind was the suicide note the police found in his shirt pocket.         
	In the one-page note, written in Gujarati, Makwana said he was committing suicide because he felt guilty as he could not avert the accident.         
	I could not avert the mishap despite my best efforts. I did everything I could but could not avoid the accident. I feel guilty, he wrote.        
	In his note, Makwana, however, did not mention anything about his wife and 12year-old son, who have been living separately for the last 10 years.         
	But he did urge the police not to harass his poor brothers, Rambhai and Gafoorbhai, who, he said, were innocent. No one should be questioned as no one is responsible for my death, he wrote in the note. Rambhai works as a watchman at the Nadiad depot.         
	J.N. Patel, a senior state transport corporation official, said Makwana was not to blame. The accident happened because the person who was driving the MUV was inexperienced and was unable to control the vehicle after overtaking, he said.         
	The MUV was being driven by 24-year-old Kalpesh Patel, who survived the crash. Kalpesh told the police that he escaped unhurt because he had his seat belt on.        
	Kalpesh, however, claimed the bus was coming from the wrong side and hit his vehicle.         
	A police officer said Makwanas act was highly unusual. So many accidents take place resulting in casualties, but no driver has killed himself out of remorse, he said. Makwana would have at best been suspended from service for some time and even if arrested, would have been out on bail.        
	In Calcutta alone, 411 road accidents occurred in 2008 claiming 421 lives. But no driver has been known to have taken his life out of guilt. Hurdles put up by powerful unions have often prevented the police from charging errant drivers under stricter laws.        
	The seven persons  two families of Navsari and Valsad  who died in the accident were returning from Virpur, a religious place in Saurashtra.         
	Kishor Tandel, 50, wife Hansa Tandel, 45, daughter Mitali, 21, and would-be daughter-in-law Nisha, 22, died in the accident.        
	Kishors friend Harish Tandel, 52, Harishs wife Rekha, 45, and daughter Amruti were the other casualties. Kishors son Ajay is in the US and was about to get married to fiancee Nisha.         
	Kishor owned a fishing trawler. Harish, a fisherman, was also a technician.

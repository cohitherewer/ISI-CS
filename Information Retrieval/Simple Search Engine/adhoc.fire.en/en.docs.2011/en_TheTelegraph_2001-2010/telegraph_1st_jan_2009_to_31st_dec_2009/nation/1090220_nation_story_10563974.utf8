          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 19: Sharad Pawar and Mulayam Singh Yadav have had the Congress worried through their recent overtures to the Shiv Sena and the BJP, respectively.        
	Although nothing substantial has come of Pawars dalliance with the Sena yet, Bal Thackeray has said he was ready to accept the NCP chief as the next Prime Minister.        
	Mulayam had said he was prepared to do business with the BJP if it gave up its three trademark issues: the Ram temple, a common civil code and the repeal of special status for Jammu and Kashmir.        
	Such churnings are routine in the run-up to elections, and Mulayam has said this at least twice in the past. Still, the Congress is concerned in the Kalyan Singh context.        
	Congress sources said they had had a bad time explaining to the partys Muslim members the understanding Mulayam had reached with Kalyan.        
	The Congress believes the allies have two scenarios in mind. One, the Congress and the BJP fail to touch the halfway mark in the next Lok Sabha, leaving the regional parties holding the aces. Two, the NDA emerges the bigger bloc, which means Pawar and Mulayam need to obfuscate the secular-communal divide before the elections so they can later go with the BJP.        
	A Congress general secretary, though, suggested Pawar could be using the Sena to force us to part with more seats. Samajwadi sources too said the BJP bogey was being whipped up to get the Congress to accept fewer seats in Uttar Pradesh.

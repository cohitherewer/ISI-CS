  - Opposition slams Nitishs Rajgir holiday        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Nitish Kumar inspects Sri Vaibhargiri Parbat, Rajgir, on Monday. (Deepak Kumar)                                        
	Patna, Dec. 28: Nitish Kumar describes his sojourn at Rajgir as a search for knowledge from the lush green historical places glorious past while taking a break from official activities in the Bihar capital.        
	Incidentally, Gautam Buddha had spent 12 long years in search of enlightenment at Rajgir, the capital of the Magadh Empire at the time. Mahavira, too, had spent time in search of kaivalya (knowledge) at Rajgir, making the place holy for Jains.        
	Contrary to Buddha and Mahavira, who meditated in the tree capped hills in seclusion, the Bihar chief minister has been moving about, meeting people, enjoying his dips in the hot-water pond and working on the project of a world class convention centre at the place which had organised the first Buddhist Council in 6th century BC.        
	He is set to lay the foundation of a world class convention centre tomorrow at Rajgir which will cost Rs 33 core. The convention centre will come up on two acres near the Thai temple at the ancient city. The dome-shaped structure that will be built by the tourism department under public private partnership will have a capacity to hold 1,300.        
	Besides, it also aims to attract tourists to Rajgir.        
	Rajgir has many tourist attractions including of Griddhakuta hill, the place that saw the conversion of Magadha king Bimbisara to Buddhism.        
	Other places such as the Jail of Bimbisara, akhara (gym) of Jarasandha, Venuvana, Karand tank, Maniyar math, Swamabhandar cave, Pippala cave, newly constructed Viswa Shanti Stupa are some of the other major tourist attractions.         
	But the Opposition, primarily his archrivals Ram Vilas Paswan and Lalu Prasad, have termed Nitishs holiday at Rajgir as downright wastage of state exchequer.         
	Nitish Kumar has deserted the Bihar capital (Patna) leaving it for non-state agents and communal elements to call the shots while he himself is enjoying life at Rajgir, LJP chief Paswan said.        
	RJD chief Lalu said: People are suffering the pangs of starvation in Bihars drought-affected districts. And the chief minister is making merry at the cost of the state. Cabinet meeting at Rajgir means the wastage of states wealth in lieu of gaining nothing.        
	But Nitish Kumar has silenced rivals in his own way. He has invited Lalu Prasad to Rajgir and requested him to take a bath in its pond. Laluji should come here this year-end and take a bath in the hot-water pond to keep his mind cool. He (Lalu) should refrain from talking gibberish, Nitish said.         
	Rajgir houses some 26 temples of the Jain sect in its hills.         
	Nitish Kumar has been trekking to these temples as the run-up to the Assembly elections next year begins.         
	But knowledge, not power, is on his wishlist.         
	I am here to seek knowledge that is important for a leader, Nitish said.

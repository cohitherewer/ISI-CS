The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Kazakh chief guest for R-Day
                                                                                                               Kazakh chief guest for R-Day
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Nazarbayev: India calling                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 10: Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev will be the chief guest at this years Republic Day parade.        
	Sources said India would be hoping to clinch an agreement on uranium supplies from the Central Asian country during Nazarbayevs four-day trip from January 23.        
	Kazakhstan has 15 per cent of the worlds uranium deposits and is aiming for an annual production of 15,000 tonnes by 2010 and 30,000 tonnes by 2018.        
	With Australia, which has some 40 per cent of the worlds uranium deposits, insisting that India join the nuclear non-proliferation regime, Kazakhstan, the sources said, was a viable alternative.        
	During Nazarbayevs visit, the two sides are expected to sign agreements on protection of intellectual property rights and geographical indications for Indian products like Basmati rice, Alphonso mangoes and Darjeeling Tea, besides other trade pacts, the sources said.        
	Trade between the two touched $232 million in the first 10 months of last year, a 300 per cent increase from 2004.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Govt mulls backward Muslim sub-quota
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Govt mulls backward Muslim sub-quota
          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 29: The government is seriously thinking of introducing a sub-quota for lower-caste Pasmanda Muslims within the existing 27 per cent reservation Other Backward Classes enjoy.         
	The government is against reservation for the entire Muslim community but we are quite serious about special reservation for backward Muslims who are one of the most deprived sections in the country, said an official with the minority affairs ministry.         
	Backward Muslims constitute around 70 per cent of the Muslim population in the country.         
	The official said the decision would be taken soon as there was consensus within the government regarding the plan. The percentage of reservation has, however, not been finalised yet.         
	 It can be 5 per cent or 6 per cent, the official said, adding that a decision on backward Christians would be taken at an appropriate time.        
	Despite the consensus within the government, the ruling UPA is worried about the controversy the decision might trigger as Hindu OBCs are bound to oppose the move.        
	The government is still against reservation on the basis of religion, the official insisted. Pasmanda Muslims are being considered for reservation because of their social and economic backwardness, not because they are Muslims.         
	The official said the Sachar committee, which looked into the status of minorities in the country, had effectively brought out the internal caste differentiation among Indian Muslims.         
	The committee had advised against any attempt to homogenise the community as a single entity and said there were layers of marginalisation within Muslim society.        
	It had divided the community into two groups  Ashrafs and Ajlafs. While Ashrafs include all Muslims who claim to be of foreign descent and high-caste Hindus who converted, Ajlafs, meaning degraded, comprise occupational groups like butchers and low-caste Hindu converts.        
	Apart from concerns over the sub-quotas potential for controversy, the government is confused about how to go about the process of implementing it. Either we will have to create a Most Backward Category (MBC) among the existing list or we will have to do a survey to estimate the number of backward Muslims, the official said.         
	The central OBC list now includes only 22 backward sections among thousands within the Muslim community.        
	The government, it is learnt, is thinking on the lines of the quota system in states like Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala where backward sections among minorities enjoy reservation.        
	Tamil Nadu has set aside 3.5 per cent of seats each for backward Muslims and Christians in educational institutions and government jobs.        
	Kerala has a 12 per cent quota for Muslims excluding the creamy layer. In Andhra Pradesh, the Legislative Assembly passed a bill in 2005, reserving 5 per cent of the seats for Muslims in educational institutions and government service.        
	Although backward sections within the Muslim and Christian communities have been demanding reservation for quite some time, successive governments had postponed a decision fearing repercussions.        
	The previous UPA government had set up a commission under Justice Ranganath Mishra to look into the issue and the panel had suggested a sub-quota for backward Muslims and Christians on the ground that castes existed irrespective of religion.

	New Delhi, May 30: A speeding Hyundai rammed into two auto-rickshaws today, killing three persons on a flyover in south Delhi.        
	Witnesses said two couples were in the car at the time of the 5am crash. All four are absconding.        
	Investigating officer Rambir Singh said it wasnt clear if the driver was drunk as police found only bottles of lemon juice and glasses from the abandoned car. Police sources say the car had a VIP number and the owner is abroad.        
	The accident occurred two days after a drunken 31-year-old mowed down three people.

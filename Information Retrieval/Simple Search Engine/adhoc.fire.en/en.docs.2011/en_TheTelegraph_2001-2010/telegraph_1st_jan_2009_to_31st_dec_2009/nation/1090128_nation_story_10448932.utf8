                                                                                                               Singhdeo in, JB Patnaik out
          SUBRAT DAS                              
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 27: Ending speculation, the Congress high command today appointed former Union minister K.P. Singhdeo as head of its Orissa unit, signalling the formal exit of veteran J.B. Patnaik from state politics.        
	Singhdeo, 68, replaced Jaydev Jena, who was asked by a visiting AICC observers team on Saturday to tender his resignation to facilitate the party revamp conducted with an eye on the forthcoming Assembly and Lok Sabha elections.        
	The high command has tried to bring in a sense of unity in the faction-ridden state unit by choosing Singhdeo, who had for long distanced himself from its activities. His unblemished public image, party insiders believed, was one of the major considerations for his nomination as Pradesh Congress Committee chief.        
	Singhdeo, the high command felt, had the potential to give a befitting reply to Mr Clean Naveen Patnaik as he has never faced allegations of corruption during his tenure as Union minister in charge of defence and information and broadcasting.        
	Singhdeo was also a known detractor of former chief minister J.B. Patnaik, who has now been named chairman of the partys manifesto committee and a permanent invitee to the CWC.         
	However, Singhdeo, who was Lok Sabha MP seven times since 1967, had a serious drawback: he was not acquainted with the intricacies of state politics and did not have a following in the party rank and file. He also lost the elections in last three terms.        
	As a balancing act, the party nominated three senior leaders  Union minister Chandrasekhar Sahu, former Union minister Bhakta Das and firebrand youth leader Lalatendu Bidyadhar Mohapatra  as PCC working presidents to assist Singhdeo.        
	While Sahu was from south Orissa, Das represented the backward KBK region. Mohapatra, a firebrand youth leader and three-time MLA from coastal Brahmagiri constituency, was a close confidant of J.B. In order to co-ordinate campaign activities, the high command chose former Union minister Srikant Jena, a Mandalite, to head the PCC campaign committee.

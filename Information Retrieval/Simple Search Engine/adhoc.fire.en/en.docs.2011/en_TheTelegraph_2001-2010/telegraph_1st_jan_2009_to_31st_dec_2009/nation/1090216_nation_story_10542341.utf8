The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Film shoot and power meters spark JNU strike
                                                                                                               Film shoot and power meters spark JNU strike
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 15: Students at the Jawaharlal Nehru University will begin a 48-hour strike from tomorrow, alleging that the varsity was commercialising the campus and altering admission procedures against the interests of deprived students.         
	The JNU Students Union (JNUSU) strike is aimed at pressuring the administration into revoking controversial decisions that have sparked protests on the campus over the past two weeks.         
	Classes are likely to be affected but administration officials will be allowed to attend office on Monday and Tuesday, the union said in a statement today. But if the demands are not met within 48 hours, the students will squat outside the administrative block from Tuesday night, blocking the entry of administrators and crippling the universitys functioning, the union warned.         
	The university has installed electricity meters in individual hostel rooms  meters were so far installed for entire hostels. The students will now have to pay user charges for electricity, which the union has opposed, arguing the administration already charges the students for basic requirements.         
	A move by the JNU to allow filming of a movie at its landmark Parthasarthy Rock also saw students protest.         
	The new JNU prospectus, just released, is 67 per cent costlier than last year and makes admission harder for poorer students, the union has claimed. Last year, the university amended its admission policy to ensure that it did not have to admit any more students than the number of seats sanctioned.         
	Traditionally, it has issued offer letters to around 10 per cent more students than the seats sanctioned  in the general and reserved categories. Since not all students who qualify finally take a seat, this ensures that seats do not go waste.         
	But if most of those offered admission accept, the university has to admit a few more students than it is officially equipped for.         
	Last year, with the university implementing 27 per cent OBC quotas in one go, several departments complained to the administration that they would not be able to cater to extra students.         
	The varsity changed its policy to issue offer letters only to the exact number of students as the seats sanctioned but the move saw over 150 seats going vacant. The wasted seats were disproportionately higher in the reserved categories.         
	The union had said last year that the new policy was hurting quota students. But the prospectus this year retained last years policy, inviting charges from the union that the administration is casteist.

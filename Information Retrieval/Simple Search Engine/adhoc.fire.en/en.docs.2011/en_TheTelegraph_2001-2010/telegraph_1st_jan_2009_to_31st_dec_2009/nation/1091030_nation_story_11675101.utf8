          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Naveen Patnaik at the 10th Orissa Disaster Preparedness Day and National Day for Disaster Reduction in Bhubaneswar on Thursday. (Sanjib Mukherjee)                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 29: On October 29, 1999, a super cyclone hit the coast of Orissa, devastating 14 districts, claiming approximately 8,962 lives and crippling the states economy.        
	The state then turned a tragic event into an opportune moment to ensure better preparedness by observing the fateful day as the State Disaster Preparedness Day and National Day for Disaster Reduction.        
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik today launched an advanced version of remote-sensing software and inaugurated a Ham radio network (amatuer stations) at a function. The 1999 cyclone was the worst disaster to hit the state, said Naveen. While we cant prevent a natural disaster from hitting us, we can be prepared to face any calamity, he said, adding that the formation of Orissa State Disaster Management Authority was a step in this regard.        
	Learning from the 1999 experience, an independent body  Orissa State Disaster Management Authority  was established. Afterwards, the model was followed by Gujarat. In the past 10 years, we concentrated on structural and non-structural initiatives, said Naveen.        
	So far, 203 multipurpose cyclone shelters and 10,000 schools have been constructed in the super cyclone-devastated areas, Naveen said, adding that 22 more shelters and 50 flood shelters were nearly complete.        
	Dedicated civil VHF network has been set up at 414 locations covering district and block headquarters, tehsils and panchayats. The panel is also setting up 220 automated weather stations in collaboration with the Indian Space Research Organisation and National Remote Sensing Centre.         
	Inaugurating the HAM radio network today, Naveen said there were 21 HAM or amateur radio stations while 291 district volunteers were being trained in five batches to man the stations.

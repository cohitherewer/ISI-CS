The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pawars Shekhawat ploy
                                                                                                               Pawars Shekhawat ploy
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               Shekhawat (top), Pawar				                                 
	New Delhi, Jan. 12: The Nationalist Congress Party today backed Bhairon Singh Shekhawats wish to contest the general election  a move observers see as a ploy by Sharad Pawar to fish in the BJPs troubled waters.        
	D.P. Tripathi, an NCP spokesperson, said the former Vice-Presidents candidature should be welcomed by all.        
	It is the considered opinion of the NCP that the candidature of Shekhawat, who is among the tallest political leaders in the country, should be welcomed. It will add to the pride of the Lok Sabha, Tripathi said.        
	It is not unconstitutional. Even C. Rajagopalachari had become chief minister of Madras after having been governor-general, he said, urging all UPA constituents to support Shekhawat.        
	On the face of it, the NCP stand appears to reflect Pawars desire to torment the BJP and weaken L.K. Advanis case for prime ministership. Shekhawat had questioned the premise that the NDA candidate for Prime Minister had been decided, saying it could be settled only after the polls.        
	Those who know Pawar closely, however, say he could be playing a deeper game. Many political observers believe that the NCP chief would be ready to play any card to fulfil his ambition of becoming Prime Minister. Pawar had to quit the Congress about a decade ago after challenging Sonia Gandhis authority.         
	By raising the Shekhawat issue, the NCP may be trying to suggest the matter of prime ministership was still open and that there could be a third candidate other than Manmohan Singh and Advani.         
	Shekhawat has not based his calculations on the BJPs support alone. He knows his prospects can take shape only if there is a fractured mandate. Political re-alignments are possible in such a scenario, and that includes the emergence of a third front.        
	Many parties in the UPA and the NDA could then switch sides, and it is difficult to guess now who could emerge the Prime Minister in that muddle. Pawar, like Shekhawat, is positioning himself for such a possibility, the observers said.        
	The NCP today announced it would contest 26 of the 48 Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra. In the last elections, the party had contested 22 seats, the rest going to the Congress.         
	Some observers, however, believe that Pawar, known for subtle manipulations, may have played his cards too early. Openly supporting Shekhawat despite being well entrenched in the UPA is not a subtle move. The Congress will not want an ally to support prime ministerial candidates from other camps.        
	BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad refused to comment on the NCP statement.

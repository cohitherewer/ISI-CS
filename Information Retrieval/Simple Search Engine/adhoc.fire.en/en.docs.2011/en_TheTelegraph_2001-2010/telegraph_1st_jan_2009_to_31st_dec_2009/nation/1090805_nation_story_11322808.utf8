   Negligence cry from kin           SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                                                  
	Mumbai, Aug. 4: The family of Rida Sheikh, the schoolgirl first to die of swine flu in India, today said they would sue the private hospital where she was admitted and the diagnostic centre that tested her blood samples wrongly.        
	Initially, they (Jehangir Hospital) was treating her for pneumonia. Later, they sent her samples for testing to a diagnostic centre which bungled, claiming she did not have the flu. This clinic was not authorised to test for swine flu in the first place. But still Jehangir insisted. It was only when she had to be put on a ventilator that they sent her samples to the National Institute of Virology, Ridas father, Sajid Usman Sheikh, 42, said.        
	The Pune institute is the nodal agency entrusted with the test for the H1N1 virus.        
	Rida was admitted to the well-known Jehangir Hospital, which got her pathological samples tested at Ruby Hall Clinic for swine flu.        
	The Maharashtra government bars private clinics from testing swine flu samples.        
	There was gross negligence on part of Jehangir Hospital. When symptoms of H1N1 are there, you have to give samples for testing to a government hospital. Why did Jehangir give it for testing to Ruby? The report came in an hour, which is shocking. It said she did not have swine flu, said Sheikhs lawyer Asif Lampwala.        
	The family has decided to file a police complaint against the hospital. We are going to sue them for damages. We will claim a lot of money. We are not interested in the money. All the money will be given to charity, Lampwala said.         
	The Sheikhs are also demanding that the hospitals doctors who treated Rida be banned from practising. They will also sue Ruby, the diagnostic centre.         
	The family said they were unaware that Jehangir and Ruby were not authorised to admit or test swine flu suspect cases. But experts said the private centres should have known the procedure.         
	They had no right to test the samples for swine flu. I wonder how they could have given the test result in an hour. It takes between 12 and 24 hours to establish swine flu, said Dr A.C. Mishra, the director of the National Institute of Virology.         
	Authorities at Jehangir Hospital refused to take calls.         
	A doctor defended the decision of not referring Rida to a government hospital. Rida came to us with non-specific symptoms on July 27. Unlike other swine flu cases she had neither a history of foreign travel nor of close contact with a person previously infected. Her first samples did not establish swine flu. After her condition deteriorated we put her on a ventilator. She was not in a position to be shifted, said the doctor on duty.

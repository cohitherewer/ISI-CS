The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Scindia in Rs 3,300 row 
                                                                                                               Scindia in Rs 3,300 row 
          RASHEED KIDWAI                                  Scindia, and the notice                                
	Bhopal, Sept. 18: In the time of austerity, even money scandals involving Congress ministers tend to be modest.        
	A day labourer has alleged that Jyotiraditya Scindia, whose family is known for its wealth and lavish lifestyle, hired him for 22 days but did not pay his wages of Rs 3,300.        
	Munna Khan, 55, a resident of Scindias parliamentary constituency of Guna, has moved the district labour office, which has sent a notice to Scindia at his Jai Vilas Palace, Gwalior. The notice asks the Union minister of state for commerce and industry to appear personally on September 30.        
	Khan says he had worked as a day labourer for Scindia during the Lok Sabha polls, doing work such as erecting makeshift platforms at campaign venues and carrying chairs.        
	My client worked for 22 days for which he was promised Rs 150 a day, Khans lawyer Pushp Raj said. But after the elections were over, the candidate and his campaign managers vanished without making the payment.        
	He added: We have several things like daily duty slips to prove that Khans services were hired. We will produce it before the appropriate forum to get justice.        
	Raj said if his client won the case, Scindia would have to pay a fine that would be 10 times what he owed Khan.        
	Scindia was not available for comment but Madhya Pradesh Congress president Suresh Pachauri said: The case sounds bizarre; (the charge is) hard to believe. I suspect it may be a conspiracy to malign him (Scindia). Under BJP rule, sometimes the state administration too acts according to the whims of the political establishment.        
	Sajeev Naik, a Congress activist from Guna who is now in Bhopal, however, said he was not sure the complaint was politically motivated.        
	I have heard of similar cases. There are many others who claim to have been shabbily treated and not paid for their work, he said in the presence of Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh, who kept mum.        
	Congress insiders said Scindia might not be directly guilty, since labourers are usually hired by a candidates agents, but added that the MP could not escape responsibility if the charge was true.

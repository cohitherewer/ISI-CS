          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Oct. 10: Forget plastic cups, this time when you are at the Bali Yatra here, starting on Kartik Purnima, you will be served tea or water in khuris, the environment friendly earthen cups that have lost favour in recent years.         
	With 2-4 lakh people thronging the yatra in Cuttack for over five days, the festival witnesses the single largest gathering in Orissa next to the Rath Yatra in Puri.        
	Senior officials of the district administration and Cuttack Municipal Corporation at a preparatory meeting yesterday decided that plastic cups will be banned at Bali Yatra.         
	The move is a small step towards environment protection. Besides, it will generate more business and employment for the local potters, Cuttack collector Kishore Kumar Mohanty said.         
	The fair on the banks of the Mahanadi against the backdrop of the historic Barabati Fort would be held from November 2-6. Official sources said about 1,000 kiosks would be put up for the fair.         
	Handicraft products of village artisans, silk and khadi products from across the state would be the main attraction.         
	Cultural programmes would be organised on all evenings at the Ganakabi Baisnava Pani Mancha on the fair grounds. Mohanty said the entire Balijatra Maidan would be insured, keeping in view the possibility of natural calamity. All kiosks would have fire safety measures according to norms, he added.         
	The organisers, Cuttack District Cultural Board and Cuttack Municipal Corporation, also decided to earmark six temporary parking areas on all sides of the maidan. It would look after the leasing out of the parking areas and fees for the merry-go-round and giant wheels on the fringes of the maidan.        
	The maidan will be divided into different zones  each demarcated into sectors with adequate number of entrance and exit gates. CCTV cameras were introduced last year to monitor the activities of visitors both inside and outside the fair, traffic congestion and other possible outbreaks or disturbances.

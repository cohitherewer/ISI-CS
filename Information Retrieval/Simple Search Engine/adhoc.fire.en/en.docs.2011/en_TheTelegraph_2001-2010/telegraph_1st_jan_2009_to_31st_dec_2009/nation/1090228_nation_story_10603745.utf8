                                                                                                               BHU blow to IIT plan
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 27: Banaras Hindu Universitys executive council has refused to part with the engineering wing, dealing a blow to the Centres plans to grant it IIT status.        
	The council has sent the HRD ministry a resolution rejecting the proposed separation of the Institute of Technology from the BHU, necessary for IIT status. The resolution comes less than a week after the BHU vice-chancellor had assured the Centre the separation was possible.        
	The council has, instead, raised visions of a new IIT coming up in Varanasi. The executive council, supreme in matters of policy, has suggested handing over 500 acres to the Centre to build a new IIT.        
	Failure to grant IIT status to IT-BHU, as promised by the Centre last year, will upset the students, now agitating against the delay on campus.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 2: Union home minister P. Chidambaram today said some extremist groups had forged ties with al Qaida.        
	Groups are co-ordinating among each other and at least some of them have forged ties with al Qaida, he said while responding in a discussion on internal security in the Rajya Sabha.        
	He also drew a parallel between India and the US, saying how luck had also played its part.        
	Referring to his visit to the US earlier, Chidambaram recounted a US officials explanation why there were no attacks after 9/11. The director of national intelligence said, we had luck on our side, and he was not being facetious, the minister said, adding that the same answer held true for India, too.        
	The home minister sought to complement the warning against complacency with a reassurance in case of an attack: Our response will be swift and decisive.         
	Chidambaram said that although there had been no terrorist strikes in India since 26/11, about a dozen attempts by terrorists were foiled.        
	The home minister said India would have zero tolerance to religion-inspired terrorism, whether inspired by jihadis or Hindus. When BJP members led by Prakash Javdekar objected to the use of Hindu, Chidambaram retorted: I cant modify my argument to please the BJP.

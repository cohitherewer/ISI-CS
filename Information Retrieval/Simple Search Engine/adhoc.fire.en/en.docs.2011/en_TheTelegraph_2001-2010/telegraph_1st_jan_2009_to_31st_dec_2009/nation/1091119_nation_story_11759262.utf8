          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 18: Thirteen technical education institutions approved by the All India Council for Technical Education are violating required norms, the CBI said today in fresh indictment of the regulatory agency.         
	The investigative agency has, however, closed cases of alleged corruption against 72 other AICTE-approved institutions, saying it did not find any material to support the allegations.         
	The CBI has suggested a set of systemic changes for the AICTE to the human resource development ministry. The AICTE is the countrys apex technical education regulator.         
	In a statement issued today, the CBI said its investigations into the complaints had revealed that 13 AICTE-approved institutions were substandard and did not meet required norms.         
	The land available and the built-up area of some of these colleges were less than the laid-down norms, the agency said. Some groups of institutions used infrastructure of already approved colleges to seek approval for new colleges under their banner.        
	The agency has unearthed financial fraud by some institutions while others have a shortage of faculty and infrastructure far exceeding allowed norms.        
	But the CBI has also criticised the AICTE. The agency has said that expert committees  sent to enquire on standards of institutions seeking recognition  overlooked various deficiencies in the infrastructure of the institutions and given a favourable report to benefit the institution.        
	In some cases, the report of the expert committees mentioning deficiencies were ignored by the AICTE while granting approval.        
	The CBI has proposed setting up a mechanism of online submission  and processing  of applications from institutions to the AICTE so that applicants can track the progress of their request.        
	Any change in faculty should be communicated to the AICTE, the CBI has suggested.         
	The CBI has also proposed making it harder for institutions to influence the composition of the visiting expert team.        
	The current system of allowing substandard institutions to continue  on probation  under the guarantee of a signed affidavit should be stopped, the CBI has said.        
	It has also proposed that the AICTE increase its own manpower and strengthen its internal vigilance to tackle corruption.

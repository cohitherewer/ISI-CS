The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bihar son pledges peace in Northeast
                                                                                                               Bihar son pledges peace in Northeast
          NALIN VERMA       
	Patna, Oct. 11: The governor-designate of Nagaland, Nikhil Kumar, expressed his determination to establish peace and set up the pace of development in the troubled Northeast.         
	People of Nagaland deserve peace. I will do everything in my power to set up a peaceful environment in one of the most beautiful states of India, said Nikhil Kumar who will take his oath on October 15. Before leaving, he spoke exclusively to The Telegraph at his Patna residence.        
	Kumar is the grandson of the first deputy chief minister of united Bihar and the member of the constituent Assembly, late Anugrah Narayan Sinha, and the son of former state chief minister late Satyendra Narayan Sinha.         
	An IPS officer of the 1963 batch, Nikhil Kumar has been a Delhi police commissioner, besides heading key security agencies such as NSG, ITBP and BSF and working as the special secretary (home) and DIG Mizoram.         
	Sources close to him believe that the Manmohan Singh government chose him for the top spot keeping in mind his experience of working in militancy-hit Northeast and with security agencies dealing with militantancy.        
	Nikhil Kumar has also represented Aurangabad, his home constituency in the Lok Sabha as a Congress MP.         
	Asked if his experience in security agencies played a role in his appointment, Nikhil Kumar said: That I cannot say, but, I am happy that Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and home minister P. Chidambaram found me worthy of the post.        
	In course of my meeting with Manmohan Singh after the notification, the Prime Minister told me that setting up peace in Nagaland was a priority for the Centre. I will try my best to justify the his faith in me, he added.         
	The Rastrapati Bhavan recently notified his appointment.         
	Asked if he will push for the finalisation of NSCN deal, he said: Primarily I will try to educate myself with the states issues. I have to update myself. He pointed out that he has been out of touch with the Northeast for 11 years. Last he served there as an IPS officer.         
	Though he is scheduled to serve the Northeast, Nikhil Kumar continues to be quite sensitive to the issues of his home state. I was really pained to find the Tatas shifting the Nano project from Singur (Bengal) to Gujarat, he said, criticising Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar.         
	Nitish Kumar talks of investment in Bihar. But the chief minister did not think of inviting the Tatas to set up their project in Bihar when they decided to move.         
	He pointed out that with the assistance of Shrikrishna Sinha, Bihars first chief minister, and Anugrah Narayan Sinha, the Tatas first set up its industry in Jameshedpur, then in united Bihar. There was no reason for the Tatas to take their project to the far-flung state, leaving Bihar, he said.         
	The Tatas shifted their venture simply because Nitish Kumar did not evince any interest, he alleged.

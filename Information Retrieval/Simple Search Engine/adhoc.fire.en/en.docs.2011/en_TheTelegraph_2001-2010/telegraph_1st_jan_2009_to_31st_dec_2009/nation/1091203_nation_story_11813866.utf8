The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Progeric brothers wish for Big B date
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Progeric brothers wish for Big B date
          NALIN VERMA                          Ekramul and Ali with their family members                                  
	Patna, Dec. 2: He is fully aware that his days are numbered. But progeria-struck Ekramul Hussein has a wish to fulfil.        
	He wants to meet Amitabh Bachchan and his son Abhishek, who have reversed their real life father-son relationship in Paa, a film based on the extremely rare disease, to be released this Friday.        
	I will be very happy to meet Amitabhji and Abhishekji. At least, they have thought it important to work in a film based on our life, Ekramul (22) told The Telegraph over phone.        
	His 11-year-old brother, Ali Hussein, too, has a similar wish. Amitabhji se milna hamare jindagi ka yadgar din hoga (Meeting Amitabh will be the memorable day of my life).        
	The two brothers sounded quite normal. It was probably because the family has reconciled to its fate and sufferings that the rare ailment has tendered to it. Their parents, Samsuddin and Razia, now in their 60s, have already lost their three children struck with what is also known as Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome.        
	Children afflicted with this disease manifest symptoms resembling aspects of aging. It has a very low incidence and occurs in one per eight million live births. According to experts, there only 48 progeria-struck patients across the world.        
	Samsuddins is, probably, the only family in India afflicted with this syndrome. Those born with progeria live only about 13 to early 20s. Residents of Dumri village in Majhi block in north Bihars Saran district, Samsuddin and Razia seem to have learnt how to cope with the loss of their children. I pray Allah to keep Ekramul and Ali happy as long as they live, Razia said.        
	The poor couple had eight children. They have lost three of them and have Ekramul and Ali counting their days. Their three children, however, are free from such symptom. Razia lives on daily wage in her village home, while Samsuddin works in Calcutta.        
	Life was extremely difficult for us initiallly. Neighbours did not allow their children to play with our kids, Samsuddin said. But Calcutta-based paediatrician Shekhar Chattopadhyay and his SB Devi Charity Home came as a big source of help in the familys hours of distress.         
	Health minister Nandkishore Yadav said: We are not quite aware about the patients for we have never been approached. Secondly, we do not have the expertise and logistics to deal with such a rare disease. But the government will definitely support any venture to get rid of the disease.        
	Razia also wished the senior Bachchan to meet her kids. Amitabhji milengein to bachche khush hongein (The kids will be happy if Amitabh meets them), said the hapless mother. But will the Big B oblige?

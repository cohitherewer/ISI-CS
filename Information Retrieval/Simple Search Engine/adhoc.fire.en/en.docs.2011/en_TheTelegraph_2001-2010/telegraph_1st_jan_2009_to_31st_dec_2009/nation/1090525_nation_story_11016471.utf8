The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Scotch whisky? It has to be Scottish
                                                                                                               Scotch whisky? It has to be Scottish
                            
	New Delhi, May 24 (PTI): Indians who swear by Scotch whisky may soon have to shell out more.        
	If Britains Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) has its way, Indian-made versions of the product could go out of the market, forcing Scotch lovers to buy imported brands.        
	The SWA wants Scotch whisky registered as a geographical indication of origin (GI) in India so that desi liquor companies cannot label their products Scotch whisky.        
	GI lays down that a product is endemic to a particular area if a given quality, reputation or other characteristic of the product is essentially attributable to its geographical origin.        
	The SWAs application was made in January 2009 and we would like to obtain the registration as soon as possible, SWAs public affairs manager David Williamson said.        
	It is hoped GI registration will support our efforts to protect Indian consumers from such imitations, as well as the integrity of Scotch whisky from fake products.        
	According to SWA, whose members produce over 95 per cent of the worlds Scotch whisky, it has been taking action for years to prevent the sale of many locally made products being passed off as Scotch whisky in India.        
	Fake or genuine, Scotch whisky accounts for less than one per cent of the Indian liquor market.        
	The brand is protected under UK law as a product that can only be made in Scotland. It is also protected under European Union and WTO laws as a recognised geographical indication. India is a member of the WTOs Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property regime and has passed its own GI Act, under which the SWA is seeking registration of Scotch whisky.

	Patna, Sept. 20: NCP today accused Nitish Kumar of doing dirty politics by opening an education centre of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) in Kishanganj.        
	NCP general secretary Tariq Anwar said that the AMU administration had decided to spend Rs 2,000 crore for five centres in India, and Katihar was selected in Bihar.        
	Anwar said that he had drawn Nitishs attention to AMUs decision for opening a new centre at Katihar and sought to acquire 250 acres land for it. But Nitish took a U-turn and chose Kishanganj as a site to garner votes before Lok Sabha polls, he said.

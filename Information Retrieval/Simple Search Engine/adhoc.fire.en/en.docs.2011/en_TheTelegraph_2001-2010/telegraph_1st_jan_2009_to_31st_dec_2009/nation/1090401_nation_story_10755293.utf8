The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bhagwat hands-off signal
                                                                                                               Bhagwat hands-off signal
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT       
	New Delhi, March 31: The new Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief, Mohan Bhagwat, today strengthened expectations that unlike his predecessor K.S. Sudarshan, he would not try to interfere in politics or the BJPs routine activities.        
	Bhagwat signalled that his priority was to strengthen the Sangh parivars ideological position through social mobilisation.        
	In his first address to swayamsevaks in Delhi as Sangh chief, Bhagwat said: We have seen that change of government didnt bring about the change we strive for. It will come through social awakening and propagation of Hindu values.        
	He avoided making any political appeal before the elections. He talked of inclusive politics, arguing that only animals think of the self while humans should take care of others, too.        
	Bhagwat did not engage in minority-bashing. He dwelt on the importance of Hindu values. He did not even use the oft-repeated Sangh plea that all communities living in India should recognise that they drew sustenance from Hindu tolerance and that they should try to Indianise their culture.         
	His predecessor, Sudarshan, had repeatedly attracted controversies by speaking that language.

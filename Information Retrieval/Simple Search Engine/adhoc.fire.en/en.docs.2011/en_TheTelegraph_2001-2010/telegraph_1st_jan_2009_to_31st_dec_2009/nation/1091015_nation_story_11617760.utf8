	Bangalore, Oct. 14: When their homes crumbled and fell and water engulfed them, the villagers of Pattadakal headed for the stone structures that have stood the test of time.        
	The temples, dating back to the seventh century and built by the Chalukyas, were among the few structures that stood above the water earlier this month as the swollen Malaprabha river flooded nearby villages, bringing down houses mostly built of mud and mortar. The temples too stand on the banks of the river, but on higher ground, which ensured that the water level receded quickly.        
	But in Pattadakal village, some 500km northwest of Bangalore, almost 800 villagers lost their homes.        
	They (villagers) have been staying in the monuments, said Bagalkot deputy commissioner D.S. Vishwanath, whose district has seen nearly 58,000 houses collapse. We have shifted them to wherever sheds were available, and additional ones are being constructed.        
	Local residents recollected the floods of 1963 but said the September 30-October 3 deluge was worse in terms of destruction. The Malaprabha, a river that originates in the Western Ghats, is a tributary of the Krishna.        
	The water came up to only the plinth portion (of the temples), said an official of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), adding that it appeared as though the Chalukyan architects had chosen their sites by taking into account the possibility of floods.         
	The structures  where once kings were coronated  were mostly unaffected. Only a wall erected around the monument complex suffered damage in a few places, he said.        
	The extensive destruction to property and crops the floods have caused across Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh has also raised questions about how much of it could be attributed to the coordination between the two southern states and Maharashtra in managing water levels at dams on the Krishna river system.        
	Karnataka plans to relocate as many as 219 villages across its northern districts that have been badly hit by the floods, and erect at least 300,000 homes for those who have been displaced.         
	S.V. Venketeshaiah, the regional director (south) of the ASI, said a team of archaeologists was at Pattadakal to assess the impact of the floods on the dozen or so monuments there. The actual assessment is awaited, he said.        
	Pattadakal is one of the two Unesco World Heritage Sites in Karnataka, the other being Hampi, the once mighty capital of the Vijayanagar empire that stands along the Tungabhadra river.        
	At Hampi, some 150km west of Pattadakal in Bellary district, some of the monuments have been waterlogged  something that occurs occasionally, depending on the flow from the Tungabhadra dam located about 12km upstream.        
	There has been some damage at five to six places, said G.S. Narasimhan, superintending archaeologist. While the outer prahara of the Vitthala temple has suffered some damage, the bazaar area  famous as the street where precious stones were sold in heaps at the height of Vijayanagars glory  and surrounding temples has been waterlogged, he said. A detailed assessment will be made after the water has receded from some of the monuments.

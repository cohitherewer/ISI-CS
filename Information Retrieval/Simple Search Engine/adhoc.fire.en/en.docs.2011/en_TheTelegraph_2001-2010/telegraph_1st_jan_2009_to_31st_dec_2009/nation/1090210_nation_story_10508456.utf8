	Cuttack, Feb. 9: The strike by house surgeons at three state-run medical colleges intensified with MBBS students boycotting classes and joining them today.        
	The surgeons under the aegis of All Orissa House Surgeons Association ceased work since Sunday demanding a 70 per cent raise  from the present Rs 5,000 to Rs 17,000  similar to an assistant surgeons revised pay.         
	All 353 house surgeons  139 of SCB in Cuttack, 107 of VSS Medical College Hospital in Burla and 107 in MKCG Medical College, Berhampur, continued with the cease work for the second day today, said association president B. Mohapatra.         
	The demand for the hike was made after the implementation of the Sixth Pay Commission recommendations on the basis of a report submitted by a fitment committee appointed by the state.         
	Though they are a vital section of the medical services, the stipend of house surgeons were not raised, said Mohapatra. Earlier, Orissa Junior Doctors Association and Orissa Medical Teachers Association had expressed support to the agitation for just demands by the house surgeons.

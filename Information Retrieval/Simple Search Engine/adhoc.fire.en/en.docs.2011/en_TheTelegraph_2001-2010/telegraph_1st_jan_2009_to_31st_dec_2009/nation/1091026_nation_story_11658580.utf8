          OUR BUREAU                              
	Oct. 25: Security forces in Jharkhand today claimed to have killed four Maoists who were part of a 30-member group apparently on its way to Bengal.        
	The whereabouts of the remaining 26 guerrillas was not known till late tonight.        
	Only one body, that of a Maoist in police clothes, was found at the encounter site in Ranchi district, which is around 40km from the Bengal border.        
	Police and CRPF officers said the group of Maoists was seen moving towards Bengal in two jeeps, probably to carry out an operation.         
	The area is known to be used by the Maoists to cross over to Purulia in Bengal.        
	The security forces first arrested three suspected escorts travelling by a motorcycle and a car. Alerted by the arrests, one of the two jeeps carrying the Maoists sped away.        
	The rebels in the other jeep fired at the police and drove into a forest, pursued by the security forces.         
	The four are suspected to have been killed in the gun battle that lasted for 90 minutes around 2.15am.        
	The police used a bullet-proof van to intercept the Maoists vehicles and continued firing at the rebels.        
	Although we have found one body, our sources have said that at least four have been killed and three rebels were injured, said Ranchi senior superintendent of police Praveen Kumar.        
	Kumar, along with CRPF commandant R.K. Sharma, briefed reporters on the joint operation.        
	Jawans blown up        
	In Chhattisgarh, four CRPF jawans died when the Maoists blew up the security forces jeep in Dantewada.         
	The explosion tossed the jeep several feet high in the air before it landed and broke into pieces, killing four CISF jawans on the spot, said Amresh Kumar Mishra, the superintendent of police.        
	A woman Maoist was killed in an encounter with security forces in Bastar, according to PTI.

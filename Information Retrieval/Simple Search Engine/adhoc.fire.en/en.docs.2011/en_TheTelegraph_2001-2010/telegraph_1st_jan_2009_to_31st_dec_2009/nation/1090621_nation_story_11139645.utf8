The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rajnath sticks to core tenets
                                                                                                               Rajnath sticks to core tenets

	New Delhi, June 20: BJP president Rajnath Singh today batted off suggestions that the party should steer away from Hindutva as a survival strategy, telling the partys national executive that it will alter neither ideology nor its core character.        
	Electoral defeat can entail changes in strategy, Rajnath said, not alterations in core beliefs. The run-up to the national executive  the first since the BJPs drubbing in the Lok Sabha polls  had seen a clamour of demands that the BJP review its brand of Hindutva and make itself attractive to minorities and secular sections if it wanted power at the Centre.        
	A party strategist, Sudheendra Kulkarni, had gone so far as to suggest in a controversial article that the BJP had lost allies on account of Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modis bleak image among minorities.        
	But Rajnath rebuffed the call for any fundamental re-orientation in the BJP, saying Hindutva, Indianness and cultural nationalism were as sacrosanct to the BJP as the Constitution was to India.         
	This toughness on ideology is no surprise  even if the BJP chooses to, the RSS, which remote-runs key decisions and keeps a vigil on ideological quality control, would not allow the BJP to compromise with the basic structure of its politics.         
	Rajnath Singh, who prepared his presidential address under close RSS monitoring, said: Our thinking has a civilisational parameter. Therefore, defeat in one or two elections cannot deviate us.         
	The party office-bearers meeting to decide the agenda for the national executive yesterday had witnessed sharp exchanges on Varun Gandhis hate speech, triggered primarily by the two Muslim leaders Shahnawaz Hussein and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi.        
	Both L.K. Advani and Rajnath were compelled to recall that the party had dissociated itself from Varuns vitriol. The fact remains, though, that the BJP gave him the party ticket for the Lok Sabha, something that sections of the party believe hurt its image and its electoral showing.         
	But the RSS has unambiguously defended Varun and firmly rejected the charge that the Pilibhit chapter had anything to do with the electoral setback. The charge that the BJPs use of religion in politics was not in sync with the progressive views of young India was dismissed by Rajnath who felt the party should instead find ways to articulate its position in a contemporary idiom.        
	Without giving any fresh insight into the reasons for the BJPs loss, he chose to attack those who were advising the party to change its ideology. He said those who were counselling that the party cut its roots had failed to understand the core of the BJP.         
	Rajnath insisted that changing the basic character or ideology proves fatal for any party. He also expressed the partys revulsion towards becoming another Congress and asked party supporters to ensure it occupied exactly the opposite pole in the polity.         
	He stressed that any dilution of the BJPs ideology will create confusion about its differences with the Congress and prove detrimental to its interests.

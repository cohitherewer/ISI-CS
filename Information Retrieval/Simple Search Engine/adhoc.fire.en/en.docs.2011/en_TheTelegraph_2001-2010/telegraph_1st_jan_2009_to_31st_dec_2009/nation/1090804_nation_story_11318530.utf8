	Guwahati, Aug. 3: Assams popular Vaishnavite musical troupes have been banned from performing in political and government programmes after a top community body found a pattern of disrespect for the spiritual tradition during such events.        
	The troupes  known as gayan-bayan  generally perform during religious congregations, especially those related to satras, or Vaishnavite monasteries. But they have also become a part and parcel of many other events, especially government-organised ones, where they are used to welcome dignitaries. Such a welcome is considered the highest honour for a guest in Assamese society.        
	The Asom Satra Mahasabha, the apex organisation of some 500 such monasteries, decided to ban gayan-bayans from such rallies during a meeting in Jorhat yesterday, saying the tradition should not be misused.        
	 There are numerous instances where a dignitary or a politician walks wearing shoes while being welcomed by the host with gayan-bayan. This is an insult to our spiritual tradition, the president of the mahasabha, Bhadra Krishna Goswami, said.        
	The mahasabha has also appealed to the people of Assam not to use gayan-bayans while welcoming guests in events other than religious ones. We cannot allow the gayan-bayan to be used to welcome anyone unless they are related to a spiritual event, Goswami said.        
	The mahasabha president said a dignitary or a guest who was welcomed by a gayan-bayan should bow to the troupe at the end of the recital in a traditional fashion. We find that many guests and dignitaries do not observe such rituals and this is against our tradition, Goswami said.        
	Lakhi Kanta Mahanta, a Sivasagar-based expert on Sattriya culture, said the mahasabha had taken the right decision since we cannot allow our spiritual ideologies of Sankardev (the communitys saint-scholar) to be misused.

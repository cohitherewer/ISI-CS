                                                                                                               Bitter cold ceases to bite at sons place of death in Mushkoh
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                          The parents and younger brother of Capt. Jerry Premraj at the 10th anniversary commemoration in Drass                             
	This war is not about the peaks and ridges on this damned frontier; it is about the men trying to hold them against odds that other men and nature have together mounted. You only get one life and these men have been ready to lose it far from home and hearth and family for as little as a patch of cold, unyielding earth that wouldnt even offer them space for final rest but which is part of what we proudly call our nation.         
	In the end they become ungainly weights on the backs of unknowing mules, their dignity wrapped in ragged blankets. If they are fortunate, these blankets will somewhere have a little badge of honour pinned  an inch of metal for miles of motherland.         
	from a report in The Telegraph, June 1999               
	The elderly couple sat in the far and low corner of the tent, as anachronistic as a pair of penguins transported to the middle of a desert. The man was in shirt sleeves, the woman in a cotton sari, both wore chappals. Sleet had begun to turn to snow flurries outside and nobody around was sans woollens, not even hardy young jawans; this was Zojila, after all, one of the countrys highest motorable passes  you dont dare it in cottons any time of the year.         
	But the two sat in the corner, unmoved and uncomplaining. There was probably more playing on their minds than just the inclement turn of weather: what an alien barrenness their young son had perished protecting, what was a boy from a shore town near Thiruvananthapuram doing on a frozen rock 15,000 feet high?         
	Capt. Jerry Premraj had been married barely a month when he was pulled out of home leave and ordered to join his artillery unit in Mushkoh Valley in July 1999. The principal peaks over Drass  Tololing, Point 5140 and Tiger Hill  had already been cleared of infiltrators and Indian forces were on a triumphal role across the war zone. The precarious ridges of Jubbar and Yaldor above Batalik were in the throes of flush-out and the threat of a Pakistan-inspired uprising in remote border villages Turtuk below Siachen had been neutralised.         
	Mushkoh, though, was still beyond grasp; its impossibly steep up-gorge terrain piled daily failure and frustration on the troops. One of the most unfancied sectors of the war of 1999, Mushkoh was also probably the most intractable and the bloodiest. And that wasnt merely on account of the easy access armed intruders had found to the heights over Mushkoh from the northern Pakistani side; that was also because it was a devils task approaching the LoC from the south.         
	Mushkoh  is a narrow slip-valley north west of Drass, as beauteous as it is treacherous  a cul de sac, cleaved by a gurgling nullah that breaks out of rock from almost nowhere. The nullahs noisy meander is flanked on either side by rocks rising perpendicular. The nearest roadhead is Drass, 15 kilometres away, and the only way to get there then was to course along a thin strip of rubble overrun by causeways. Getting men and machines into Mushkoh was a lumber.         
	The valley base was too narrow for heavy artillery to be effective; the heights were unapproachable by chopper or gunship because they forever risked fire from infiltrators parked along the ledges. Casualties were so frequent, theyd had to create an underground field dispensary; it used to be forever choked with the dead and the dying, an etherised mess of sack-cloth, bandages and blood. Welcome to the killing field, the brigade-major who headed Camp Mushkoh had told some of us, We specialise in dispensing medal commendations as death certificates here.         
	Two days after he arrived in the devastation of Mushkoh  it would have been the night of July 6, 1999  Capt. Premraj left his artillery position to join infantrymen battling fire from atop to recover Point 4875, a craggy rock face key to clearing Mushkoh. Part of his task was to clamber up and guide artillery fire on occupied positions.         
	Point 4875 was taken next day under co-ordinated fire from artillery and infantry guns; celebration erupted in the Mushkoh brigade. But the price of victory had been high  10 jawans wounded and 17 killed; all of them slithered down the ridges on muleback the next day.         
	Capt. Premraj was among them, taken away by a single sniper bullet that had merely grazed his arm and burst a vein. Normally, that would have meant a minor injury but at that height the blown vein bled too quickly for the young soldier to survive. He got a posthumous Vir Chakra, his wife moved on from a brutally truncated marriage, his memory became an occasional, but uncontrollable, sob in his modest Venganoor home.         
	A close friend had arrived in Mushkoh the following day to take Capt. Premrajs body back home in a cask to Kerala for the last rites. Its only now, 10 years later that his parents  Ratnarajan and Chellathai, the elderly underclad couple in the far low corner of the tent  were making the journey back to where it had all ended for their son.         
	They spent the two days of commemoration stoic and silent, never uttering a word, not for the cutting cold, not for all the pain.

	Chandigarh, Dec. 27: Ruchika Girhotras family today said it would approach the Supreme Court to reopen the molestation case against former Haryana police chief S.P.S. Rathore and include the charge of abetting suicide.        
	PTI today quoted former CBI joint director R.M. Singh as alleging that Rathore had used his influence to get the charge of abetment of suicide dropped, and that he had tried to bribe Singh and other officers handling the probe.        
	Rathore has been sentenced to six months for molesting Ruchika, then 14, in August 1990. She committed suicide in 1993, unable to bear police harassment of her parents and brother, her family has said.         
	We will be filing a petition to reopen the case to include Section 306 (abetment to suicide) immediately after the apex court reopens after the holiday, the familys lawyer, Pankaj Bhardwaj, said.        
	Ruchikas father S.C. Girhotra said that had the CBI included Section 306 in the chargesheet, Rathore might have received a tougher sentence. I do not know why they (the CBI) made this compromise, Girhotra said.        
	We would also be seeking a re-look into the fudging of the inquest proceedings, lawyer Bharadwaj said.        
	He said the police inquest report had blamed Ruchikas death on excessive use of slimming pills although she had drunk a poisonous pesticide.        
	Bharadwaj said Ruchikas name was given as Ruby and her age as 19 in the police report on her death, PTI reported. The lawyer added that he did not know any Veena Girhotra, whose signature purportedly figures in the witness column of the records of the inquest proceedings.        
	Former CBI official R.M. Singh, who was in charge of the probe, claimed he had recommended the charge of abetment of suicide, according to PTI. He said the final decision on the charges rested with the agency director, who acted on legal advice.        
	He (Rathore) even stated that he was going to bribe me also and offered all help when I was constructing my house, Singh was quoted as saying.        
	When the file reached me, he started coming to my office. Everyday he used to come. He started sort of influencing me to get a favourable report and sometimes he used to come to my chamber, my office, even before I reached office. He used to call me up on phone many times at my residence also. Singh claimed he had brought all this to his seniors notice.        
	Efforts to contact Rathore were met with a polite he is not giving any interview from his wife Abha, a lawyer.        
	The CBI is planning to fast-track a similar case it is handling in Haryana, sources said. Sarita, a 27-year-old mother of two, had committed suicide at the police headquarters in Panchkula last year because no action had been taken against two policemen she had accused of raping her in a Rohtak police station.        
	The case is being heard in the CBI court in Ambala. The accused have been charged with abetting suicide.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Berth battle on
                                                                                                               Berth battle on
          SUBRAT DAS                               
	Bhubaneswar, May 19: Intense lobbying for ministerial berths has begun in the BJD, which is in the process of forming a government.        
	Unlike the 2000 and 2004 Assembly polls when the party had formed a coalition government with the BJP, this time BJD will form the government alone.        
	Though, BJD leadership will have a free hand in choosing candidates, it promises to be a harrowing task as 22 candidates have to be picked up from 103 legislators elected. Orissa Assembly has a cabinet ceiling of 22 seats, 15 per cent of the total strength of the Assembly. The task has become doubly difficult, as there are more than 20 experienced hands (eight ministers, one former Speaker and 11 former ministers) and more than 50 young hopeful legislators.         
	We are aiming for a combination of experienced hands and young leaders, said BJD senior Pyari Mohan Mohapatra, who is regarded as Naveens advisor and party strategist. The new ministry will have representation of all regions and all sections, added Mohapatra.         
	Among the experienced hands, finance minister Prafulla Ghadei, energy minister Surya Narayan Patro, works minister A.U. Singhdeo, panchayati raj and parliamentary affairs minister Raghunath Mohanty, tourism and excise minister Debi Prasad Mishra, steel and mines minister Pardip Amat and women and child development minister Pramila Mallick stand fair chance. Besides, BJD secretary-general Damodar Rout, earlier dropped after he allegedly fell from Naveens grace, is likely to be re-inducted.         
	Naveen was elected unanimously as the leader of BJD legislators this afternoon and later he will stake his claim to form the new government that may be formed on Friday.

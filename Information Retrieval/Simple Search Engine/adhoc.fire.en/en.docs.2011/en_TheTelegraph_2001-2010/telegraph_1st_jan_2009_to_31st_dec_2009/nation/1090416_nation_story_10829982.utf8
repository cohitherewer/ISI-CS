The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Conscience thicker than Congress in son politics
                                                                                                               Conscience thicker than Congress in son politics
          MANINI CHATTERJEE IN SULTAN BATHERI (WAYANAD)                                            
	Incoming phone calls to Wayanad  this breathtakingly beautiful district dotted with tea gardens and lush paddy fields amid the thickly forested hills of north-east Kerala  have registered a spurt in recent weeks.         
	Thats what we heard a week ago in Thiruvananthapuram. On reaching here, we discover that it isnt quite an apocryphal story.         
	Suresh Nair confirms that he has received a couple of calls from the supporters of K. Karunakaran, the grand old man of the Congress in Kerala. Others have been approached directly by Karunakaran who  when he is not sharing the dais with Sonia Gandhi  is discreetly asking Congress supporters to give a manasakshi (conscience) vote to his son who rebelled along with him but has refused to return to the parent party.         
	K. Muralidharan is the NCP candidate in the newly formed Wayanad parliamentary constituency and as individual profiles go towers above the two main contenders  M.I. Shahnawaz (Congress) and M. Rahmathulla (CPI).         
	Karunakarans son, Murali as he is known, is not exactly a stranger to these parts. He has been a Congress MP from neighbouring Calicut as well as the Calicut district Congress chief. With three Assembly segments of Calicut included in the new Wayanad seat, Murali can claim to have something of a mass base.         
	There is also a certain sympathy factor working in his favour. People feel he has been wronged, he would have been a big leader in the Congress now but has struck out on his own and deserves our support, says Bharathi, an avowed LDF supporter who has no intention to vote for him.         
	.T. Balakrishnan, who has RSS leanings, insists that Murali is way ahead in the race with both Congress and Left supporters backing him.         
	Among the three candidates, Murali is easily the best. When he was an MP, he helped anyone who came to him regardless of their political leanings. The real fight here is between him and the Left candidate, claims the farmer, standing in his courtyard overlooking an expanse of banana trees.         
	But for all his evident popularity and success in getting the support of various community organisations representing Christians, Muslims, Nairs and tribals that make up the 11-lakh electorate in Wayanad, he is up against the much superior organisations of the LDF and the UDF.                 
	Wayanad was considered a traditional UDF (the Congress and the IUML) stronghold till the CPM began making swift inroads as recently as five years ago. In 2004, the LDF won all the Assembly segments that fell under the Wayanad revenue district and followed it up with winning 21 of the 25 gram panchayats in the local body elections in 2005.         
	The winning spree continued with LDF candidates (two CPM, one JD(S)) bagging all three Assembly segments of Wayanad in 2006 by big margins. But JD(S) MLA Shreyams Kumar has left the LDF along with father Veerendra Kumar and is now campaigning for the Lefts defeat.         
	Even so, CPM activists are confident that the Left will score a surprise victory though many of them are upset that the state leadership handed over the seat to the CPI which has no base whatsoever of its own in Wayanad.         
	The CPMs claims rest on the fact that the party and its mass organisations have a lot to show for in Wayanad.         
	According to CPM MLA Krishna Prasad from Sultan Batheri (named after Tipu Sultans battery when he was battling the British), the agitations led by the Adivasi Kshema Samithi (AKS) and the Kisan Sabha on behalf of impoverished tribals and farmers since 2003 is in large part responsible for the CPMs strength in the region.         
	The AKS agitation led to the capture of 5,000 acres of forest land that had been denied to the tribals despite a 1971 law. After the LDF came to power in 2006, systematic efforts have been made to implement the law, and after the forest rights bill was passed by Parliament, Wayanad tribals were the first in India to benefit from its provisions. Over 7,000 Adivasis of Wayanad are eligible under the new law and distribution of pattas has begun in earnest.         
	The pro-farmer policies of the LDF government have also ended the spate of suicides that took place in Wayanad a few years ago.         
	The combination of grassroots agitation and governmental initiatives has transformed Wayanad into a favourable seat for the Left, Krishna Prasad says, strongly denying that the CPM is not working for the CPI candidate who is entirely dependent on the bigger Left party. If the Congress wins this seat, it will be a defeat for the Left as a whole and our workers and supporters realise that fully, he insists.         
	The Congress candidate is also considered weak and is facing some trouble since the party ticket was denied to Rosakutty Teacher who enjoyed much greater support locally.         
	But as elsewhere in the state, Congress workers  those of whom have not switched wholesale to Muralis camp  claim that the silent anti-LDF, pro-UDF wave will see them through in a traditional stronghold where the Lefts 2004-06 victories were more an aberration than the norm.         
	Both the Congress and the CPM feel that Murali will get enough votes to be a spoiler, not a winner. But his supporters point out that if the NCP candidate wins, he has every chance of being Union minister. Given that Sharad Pawar is one man who can cut deals with any front  left, right or centre  that is not an idle boast.         
	 Wayanad votes today

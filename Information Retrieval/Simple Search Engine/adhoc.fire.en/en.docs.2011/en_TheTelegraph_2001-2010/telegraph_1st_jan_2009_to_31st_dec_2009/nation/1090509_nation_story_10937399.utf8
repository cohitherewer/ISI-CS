The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | EC move earns NDA ire
                                                                                                               EC move earns NDA ire

	Patna/Delhi, April 8: The Election Commission (EC) will be sending six teams of two officers as special observers to reassess polling in six Lok Sabha constituencies of Bihar, prompting the BJP to react angrily to the unprecedented move.        
	The NDA has sensed a conspiracy behind the move and has faxed a letter to the EC asking it to explain the reasons for sending in officers after polling, in some cases repolling, was concluded in all 40 constituencies of the state.         
	The seats which are under the ECs scanner include Maharajganj, Saran (Lalu Prasad is a candidate there), Aurangabad, Jamui, Jehanabad and Munger.         
	State BJP chief Radha Mohan Singh and JD(U) general secretary Shivanand Tiwary linked Lalu Prasads refusal to attend todays Cabinet meeting chaired by Manmohan Singh to the conspiracy.         
	The NDA leaders alleged that Lalu Prasad called the Prime Minister, complaining of poll irregularities and threatened to boycott the meeting until the government put pressure on the EC to send the observers.         
	On Lalus pressure, Tiwary alleged, the EC sent the observers without making the reasons transparent. Repolling in certain booths in constituencies under scanner has already been concluded.        
	The BJP sought an appointment with the EC to lodge a protest against what it described as an unprecedented decision taken after 22 days of polling. BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said in Delhi the late intervention could be a first of its kind and wanted to know the nature of complaints. He hoped that the EC would follow tradition in which free polls were conducted in the past, an allusion to the ECs record under former CEC N. Gopalaswami.

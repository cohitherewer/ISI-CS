The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Poll steam for hired choppers
                                                                                                               Poll steam for hired choppers
                                          
	Election season is proving a recession-proof money-spinner for the countrys fleet of helicopter charter firms.        
	The demand far outstrips the supply, and prices have shot up by 60-70 per cent, said Subhash Goel, chairman of Stic Travels, which has a helicopter and small aircraft charter business. We can rent out up to 100 helicopters and aircraft, and they are all booked.        
	India has a fleet of about 200 commercial and privately owned civilian helicopters that are rented out by some 55 air charter companies. An equal number of small aircraft are estimated to be available for hire.                  
	Although a large chunk of these are on permanent hire to oil and gas exploration firms, mining companies and the like, a portion of the fleet is available for casual clients. Charter firms say most of these aircraft have been snapped up by political parties and individual leaders who plan to criss-cross the country ahead of the general election.        
	Industry sources said the Congress had hired 15-20 helicopters; the BJP between 12 and 15, and the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party about half a dozen each. Lalu Prasads Rashtriya Janata Dal has chartered three and even Ram Vilas Paswans Lok Janshakti Party has hired at least one chopper.        
	Except for a few fixed-wing aircraft, nothing is available now, said a charter operator. The political parties are asked to pay cash upfront.                  
	The rental for the five-seater Bell 407 has shot up to Rs 1-1.1 lakh an hour from Rs 75,000 an hour . Political leaders who rent this US-made chopper have to hire it for at least an assured three hours of flying every day for a minimum of 45 days.        
	Even the basic fixed-wing turboprop King Air C90 is being rented out at Rs 70,000 an hour against the normal rate of Rs 40,000 an hour.        
	Helicopters score over small planes since they can land at any place where there is a field after notifying the district authorities. Fixed-wing aircraft need better landing facilities and larger fields.        
	Choppers had been chartered out even during the 2004 general election but the numbers were fewer. Only top leaders of the bigger parties had hired helicopters.                   
	Luxury vans and sports or multi-utility vehicles had ruled in the run-up to Election 2004. Charter firms say that this time, security concerns have meant that even middle-rung leaders have rented choppers or planes.        
	Besides saving time, aircraft are supposed to offer safer travel. Hence the mad scramble for helicopter charters this year, said Sanjeev Rohatgi, who runs a charter consultancy.        
	Intelligence agencies claim to have specific information about planned attacks on political leaders by militant groups such as the Lashkar-e-Toiba and the northeastern outfits.

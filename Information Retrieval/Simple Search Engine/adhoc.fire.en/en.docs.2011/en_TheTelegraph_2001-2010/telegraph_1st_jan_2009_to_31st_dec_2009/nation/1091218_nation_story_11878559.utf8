          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           LJP workers attempt to enter the Assembly on Thursday. Picture by Deepak Kumar                                  
	Patna, Dec. 17: A large number of LJP members descended on the state capital today, the opening day of the legislatures winter session, in what is being termed as Ram Vilas Paswans show of strength.         
	Unable to control the turmoil on the streets, security forces caned party workers trying to break through the security cordon and forcing their way to the Assembly.         
	LJP MLAs Pashupatinath Paras and Achyutanand were among 15 who were injured in the melee.         
	Christened the Dalit Ekta Rally, it was a Paswan versus Nitish Kumar show among the Dalits as Paswans cadre  brought in buses, trucks and tractors from various parts of the state into the capital  patrolled the streets, sending traffic haywire.         
	The security forces, instructed to stay restrained, probably had the toughest time dealing with such a huge show of the Opposition, for the first time in four years of Nitish Kumars rule.         
	Paswan dubbed the chief ministers formation of Mahadalit Commission and initiation of several welfare schemes for the mahadalits (considered lowest among the Dalits) a ploy to divide the Dalit community for political mileage.         
	But Nitish Kumar, composed and tactical, said: Hooliganism will not help Paswan. Our government has been empowering the Dalits rather than dividing them. We have a scheme for Paswans, too. We are giving houses and land to Dalits who are happy in our rule.         
	Earlier in the day, all the 15 LJP legislators had gathered with placards protesting against atrocities on Dalits and poor law and order situation on the Assembly premises, as soon as the House gathered for the winter session.         
	The RJD and LJP members shouted anti-government slogans in the House, too.         
	The countdown of Nitish government has started with todays rally, Ram Vilas Paswan roared, adding: Now he is getting the taste of what the Opposition actually stands for. In the days to follow, we (RJD-LJP) will show him the actual strength of the Opposition. His days in the ruling chair are numbered.

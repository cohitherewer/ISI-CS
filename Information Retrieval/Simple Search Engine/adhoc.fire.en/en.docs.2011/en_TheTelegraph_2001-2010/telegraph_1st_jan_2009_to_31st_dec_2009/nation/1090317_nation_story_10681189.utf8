The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Karnataka kickoff snub for stillborn front
                                                                                                               Karnataka kickoff snub for stillborn front
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sonia: Slight on Karat baby                                  
	New Delhi, March 16: Sonia Gandhi is likely to bypass Left bastion Kerala and launch her poll campaign from BJP-ruled Karnataka in a conscious strategy to make light of the third front and hold up the NDA as the main adversary.        
	She is expected to mark the kickoff on March 23 from central Karnatakas Davangere, Congress sources said.        
	The choice has surprised those who thought she would hold her first rally in Kerala, which votes in the first phase, ahead of Karnataka where elections are scheduled in the second and third round.        
	But sources said party strategists wanted Sonia to choose a BJP stronghold, and Davangere was perfect because the BJP had won six of the regions seven seats in the 2007 Assembly polls.        
	Besides, H.D. Deve Gowdas Janata Dal (Secular) is barely present in the region, so it would be easier for Sonia to focus her attack on the BJP and not dilute its thrust by bringing in the third front.        
	Asked why she hadnt picked a state where the Congress was pitted directly against the BJP, the sources conceded that the party was in a shambles in Gujarat where several of its MLAs recently defected to the BJP.        
	As for Madhya Pradesh, the Congress is yet to gauge the extent of infighting in the state unit and its possible impact on poll results.        
	Karnataka, on the other hand, offers a comfort of sorts  the Congress polled more votes there than the BJP in the last elections although it won fewer seats. Its organisation too is intact in the state, the leadership having successfully put down factionalism.        
	Although the Congress had been tearing into Prakash Karats non-BJP, non-Congress alternative for most of last week, Sonias speech is expected to reflect the broader strategy of painting the NDA as the main rival rather than the fledgling third front.        
	Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi today described the third front as a stillborn baby. The Congress apparently wants to drive home the point that a chaotic group with more prime ministerial claimants than voters has no chance with the electorate.        
	We want to banish this front from the peoples radar so that it doesnt even figure as an option by the time they vote, a Congress official said.        
	Our tactic worked during the trust vote (last July). When it looked as though Karat might upset the apple cart by positioning Mayavati as the leader of an alternative front, we started a campaign among MPs on whom they wanted as their Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh or Mayavati. The answer was for the country to see.        
	The Congress fights the front directly only in Andhra Pradesh and Orissa. In the other states where the party is relatively strong, it faces either the NDA or the Left.        
	Its battle against the Left, however, will be fought through a coalition both in Bengal and Kerala.

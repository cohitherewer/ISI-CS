The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | New date in nun rape case
                                                                                                               New date in nun rape case
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, May 2: A sub-divisional judicial magistrate rescheduled a second test identification parade of those accused of gangrape of a nun last year to May 7 after rejecting the victims plea to shift it to a venue outside Kandhamal.        
	The 29-year-old nun, who was allegedly raped at K. Nuagaon under the Baliguda police station on August 25, 2008, did not attend yesterdays identification parade after filing a petition at a Baliguda court saying she did not feel safe about visiting the district again.        
	The nuns lawyer also sought more time citing her pending petition in the Orissa High Court.         
	Sub-divisional judicial magistrate G. Barik, however, rejected her petition and fixed May 7 as the next date for conducting the second identification parade at Baliguda sub-jail.        
	The first identification parade was held at Choudwar jail in Cuttack on January 5 after the high court agreed to her request to shift the venue out of Kandhamal. During the parade, she had identified two persons.        
	A second identification parade became imperative as five more accused were arrested. Accordingly, all arrangements for conducting the test identification parade were made at the Baliguda sub-jail on May 1. But the nun stayed away, a crime branch official said.         
	Last month, the nun had filed a petition in high court seeking a change in venue of the trial to Cuttack from Baliguda where she doubted she would get a fair trail.         
	There was always a threat to my life in Baliguda after the August 25, 2008, incident and the situation has not improved in the locality, she said in her plea.        
	On April 16, the high court admitted the petition and issued notices to the state government to clarify its stand within two weeks. The court had also imposed interim restrictions on proceedings involving deposition by the victim in the trial court.

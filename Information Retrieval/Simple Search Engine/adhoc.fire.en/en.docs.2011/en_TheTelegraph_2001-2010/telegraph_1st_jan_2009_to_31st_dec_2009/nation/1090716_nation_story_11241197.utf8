          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Raipur, July 15: The Chhattisgarh government has announced more sops for security personnel combating Maoists in the rebel zones of the state.         
	The move is been viewed as the state governments desperate attempt to woo policemen to work in disturbed areas. Officers and policemen susually avoid postings in the red zone.        
	The state cabinet today approved a number of proposals of the states home department to give a better package to the policemen fighting the Maoist menace.         
	Sops come in the backdrop of Madanwada Maoist attacks that killed 36 jawans, including a superintendent of police, Vinod Kumar Choubey, on Sunday. The government has decided to employ relatives of policemen killed in the Maoist attacks on compassionate grounds within 60 days (of the incident), chief minister Raman Singh said.         
	Besides Choubey, relatives of inspector Vinod Dhruv, sub-inspectors Komal Sahu and Dhanesh Sahu are now slated to get a job, given according to their academic qualification and eligibility, Singh added.         
	The government has also decided to hike special Maoist allowance to be paid to policemen posted in the worst affected districts of the state. The jawans will now receive a special allowance of 20 per cent of their basic pay instead of existing 15 per cent.         
	Relatives of the personnel killed after April 1, 2009, would receive concession ranging from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 6 lakh to purchase houses from the Chhattisgarh State Housing Board. If kin of a class-one officer purchase a house he or she will be entitled to a discount of Rs 6 lakh, Singh said.         
	Family members of class-two officers would receive Rs 4 lakh concession, while class-three and four employees families have to pay Rs 2 lakh less.

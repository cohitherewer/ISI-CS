                                                                                                               Congress fields Jogi loyalists
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Raipur, March 10: Supporters of former chief minister and Congress stalwart Ajit Jogi have found a place in the first list of candidates announced for the Lok Sabha elections in Chhattisgarh.         
	However, his son, Amit, has been left out in the cold for now. Yesterday night, the Congress announced the names of candidates for six Lok Sabha seats out of the total 11 in Chhattisgarh.        
	Though the son missed a chance, the former chief minister did bag the maximum number of seats for his supporters. Of the six, four are affiliated to the Jogi camp.        
	For now, candidates have pleaded for anonymity, suspecting that senior Congress leaders would not be too happy by the selections. The names for the remaining five seats are likely to be announced after Holi.         
	The delay has been attributed to a dispute over fielding Amit from one of the constituencies as Jogis opponents have lodged strong protests against Amits candidature. Jogis son hogged the limelight after reports of him stepping into his fathers shoes were circulated.         
	According to reports, Amits name has emerged from Mahasamund and Bilaspur Lok Sabha seats. However, Congress leaders have also invited him to contest from Raigarh Lok Sabha seat, which his father had once represented. With junior Jogi waiting for a debut in politics, all eyes are now set on the second list of Congress candidates.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Imagine 20-storey houses in area as big as Salt Lake under water: the story of a close shave in Andhra
                                                                                                               Imagine 20-storey houses in area as big as Salt Lake under water: the story of a close shave in Andhra
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                                      
	Hyderabad, Oct. 5: As Andhra Pradesh reeled under floods on Friday, its administration had a bigger headache than the continuing rain  the threat of a man-made deluge.        
	Neighbouring Karnataka, hit equally badly by floods, was going to release a huge volume of water from its dams and barrages into the Krishna, which flows into Andhra.        
	The release  26 lakh cusec or 26 lakh cubic feet per second  was nearly twice the rate at which the rain itself was dumping water in the rivers immediate catchment area in Andhra.        
	One hour of such release is equivalent to the entire water supply to Calcutta for six years. Over 12 hours  which is how long Karnataka released at that rate  the entire water, if accumulated, would be enough to submerge all 20-storey buildings across an area as large as Salt Lake.        
	Andhra irrigation secretary S.P. Tucker said the state government had anticipated such a release from Karnataka about eight hours before it started on Friday evening.        
	We were driven to the wall  how do we manage so much water that was expected to reach Srisailam reservoir (on the Krishna? he said.        
	Such a huge inflow had never happened before. We call it probable maximum flood (PMF), he said, referring to a hypothetical scenario that can happen if every meteorological and hydrological factor is at its worst at the same time. Its a one-in-10,000-years possibility, Tucker said.        
	For three hours, experts, politicians and administrators racked their brains at their war room in Jala Soudha, the irrigation department headquarters in Hyderabad.        
	At this point, retired chief engineers and irrigation experts came up with an idea: why not use the freeboard capacity at Srisailam?        
	The freeboard is the distance between the maximum permitted water level in a reservoir behind a dam and the top of the dam wall.        
	The freeboard capacity is normally kept free. It is used for shifting water flow from one canal region to another, but for a very short period, said M.K. Rahman, engineer-in-chief of the irrigation department.        
	Storing water at this level beyond four to five hours carries the risk of damage to the reservoirs masonry embankments, which can cause a disaster. But now there was no option.        
	The war room decided to open the emergency gate at Srisailam to let out 13 lakh cusecs downstream  the maximum that could be released without a catastrophe downstream in Kurnool town and hundreds of villages  and store the remaining half of the Karnataka release.        
	Srisailam has a freeboard capacity of 12 feet over and above the full reservoir level (FRL) of 891 feet. We did not need all the 12 feet but only five feet  up to 896 feet  to save the situation, Rahman said.        
	Chief minister K. Rosaiah gave his permission hesitantly  a second expert opinion had said such heavy storage might breach the masonry embankment. Fearing the worst, Rosaiah, cabinet ministers and senior bureaucrats spent a sleepless Friday night huddled at the secretariat.        
	But the embankments held up. One factor that helped, officials said, was that the inflow from Karnataka wasnt a steady 26 lakh cusec but kept fluctuating. On Saturday morning, once the Karnataka release eased off, the water in the Srisailam freeboard was released downstream at 13 lakh cusec.        
	Thanks to the design of the Srisailam reservoir and the alertness of our officials, the lives of thousands of residents of Kurnool and Krishna districts were saved, Rosaiah said.        
	Officials said a PMF was no longer a one-in-10,000-years scenario  climate change had taken care of that.        
	Tucker said the denudation of parts of the Nallamala forest, which lies in the catchment region around Srisailam, had worsened matters by speeding up the local inflow from the rainwater, as distinct from the Karnataka release.        
	The heavy deforestation of the area for irrigation projects and to demolish Maoist hideouts in the past few years was a factor, he said.

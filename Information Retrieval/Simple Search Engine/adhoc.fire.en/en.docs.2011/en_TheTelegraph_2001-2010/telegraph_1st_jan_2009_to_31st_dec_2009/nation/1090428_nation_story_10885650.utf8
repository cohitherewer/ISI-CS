The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong blows hot and cold on Modi
                                                                                                               Cong blows hot and cold on Modi
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Abhishek Singhvi                                  
	New Delhi, April 27: The Congress did a somersault today, attacking Narendra Modi and then piping down, after the Supreme Court ordered a probe into the Gujarat chief ministers role in the 2002 riots.        
	First, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi demanded Modis resignation and sneered that he was probably neither contrite nor apologetic nor even regretful over the court order. Singhvi warned Modi not to extract political mileage from the directive.        
	Within a couple of hours, Janardhan Dwivedi, who heads the Congress media cell, came up with the partys official stand: the Congress honoured the court order but had not gone through it.        
	We do not want to say anything more. The matter is sub judice. Let the probe take place; let it reach a final conclusion, he said.        
	The Congress remembers how Modi had turned Sonia Gandhis reference to him as a maut ka saudagar (merchant of death) into his campaign theme in the 2007 Gujarat elections.        
	Congress sources said that while Modi was unlikely to respond to the court order, Singhvis comments might have provoked him to say something in his defence. He would have asked for votes in the name of Gujarati pride, a source said.        
	Singhvi, briefing the media, had said: For the first time in the history of independent India, the entire bunch of cases has been transferred out of a state. We had hoped he (Modi) would have resigned earlier. But he is power-hungry; he will not do it.        
	If he is unprepared to listen what can be done? If there was no SIT (special investigative team), the aam aadmi, who has been badly victimised, could never have hoped to see police and administrative officials being charge-sheeted.        
	Congress sources said party leaders were upset at the remarks and felt that Singhvi ought not to have spoken out spontaneously on an issue involving the judiciary and a political heavyweight like Modi.        
	Usually, before a briefing, the spokesperson meets members of the media cell to firm up the official line on the days issues. The decision is communicated to spokespersons in the state capitals to avoid discrepancies. With most of the media cell members away, the session did not take place today, the sources said.        
	Besides, the Congress was afraid that having advised Modi not to politicise the matter, the party could be seen as itself doing so.        
	The BJP would have reacted; we would have had to answer back and the whole thing would have got prolonged. It would have put Modi in the spotlight and portrayed him as some sort of a victim. We had to nip it in the bud, a source said.

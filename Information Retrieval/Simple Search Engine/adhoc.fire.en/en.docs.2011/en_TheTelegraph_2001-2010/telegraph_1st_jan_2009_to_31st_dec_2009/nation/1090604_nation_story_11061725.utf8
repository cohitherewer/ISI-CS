The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Strike cloud on Valley 
                                                                                                               Strike cloud on Valley 
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                           Geelani: Demilitarisation demand                                  
	Srinagar, June 3: Kashmir today appeared headed for a long period of uncertainty with Hurriyat hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani calling for more strikes, shortly before his arrest.         
	Geelani initially called for an indefinite strike till demilitarisation takes place in the state but the Hurriyat, perhaps fearing a public backlash, modified it, saying the strike would continue for two more days and the future course would be decided on Friday.         
	The strike call was given as the Kashmir Valley remained shut on the third consecutive day to protest the alleged rape and murder of two women by security forces in Shopian.         
	The Jammu and Kashmir government claims the two died by drowning in a stream but has ordered a judicial inquiry to calm down the people.         
	The president of the Peoples Democratic Party, Mehbooba Mufti, today led a march of over a dozen MLAs and PDP supporters to Shopian in support of protesters.         
	But she was greeted by a hostile crowd who accused her of politicising the issue. They also shouted pro-freedom, anti-PDP and anti-India slogans. Mehbooba rushed to a police station reportedly to save herself.         
	Earlier, the police stopped media persons one kilometre short of Geelanis Hyderpora residence where he was to address a news conference at the end of a three-day strike.         
	The Hurriyat hawk spoke to the media through a telephonic address and demanded demilitarisation. The Shopian incident has shocked us and our people are not safe in the presence of military men, he said.         
	The tourism industry had hoped the strike would end and tourists would return to kashmir. Last years anti-Amarnath land agitation had ruined the tourism season.         
	Tourists are fleeing Kashmir because of the strike and we already have a lot of cancellations, said Mohammad Azim Tuman, the president of the Kashmir Houseboat Owners Association.         
	Chief minister Omar Abdullah made a desperate bid to end the protests by roping in people from tourism trade.         
	The frequent strikes mar the current tourist season and deprive thousands of people from earning their livelihood, Abdullah said, addressing representatives of over a dozen associations connected with the tourism industry.         
	Normal life in the Valley remained paralysed as dozens were injured in clashes between the police and protesters at various places.

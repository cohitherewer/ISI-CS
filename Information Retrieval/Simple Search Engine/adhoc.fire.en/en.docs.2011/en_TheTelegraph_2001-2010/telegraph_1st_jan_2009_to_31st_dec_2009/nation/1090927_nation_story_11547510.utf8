          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Sept. 26: Two constables in their mid-forties, Sisirkanti Nag and Siteswarprasad Singh, were abducted at Maoist-infested Belpahari in West Midnapore this evening.        
	The spot where the abduction took place is about 50km from Lalgarh and 12km from a dense forest.        
	The policemen were asked to get off a private bus by suspected Maoists. The two were returning to a police outpost in Banspahari, 260km from Calcutta, from Jhargram, according to Manoj Verma, the West Midnapore superintendent of police.        
	Verma said late tonight that no link had been established yet between the abductions and the arrest of leader of Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, Chhatradhar Mahato, earlier in the day. We did not receive any such demand (to release Mahato) but we are exploring all angles, he said.        
	The constables went to Jhargram in the afternoon to buy some articles for their personal use. They boarded a Purulia-bound bus from Jhargram around 5pm and was returning to the outpost. The bus passes through Banspahari, about 70km from Jhargram, said an official in Belpahari police station.        
	As the bus left a halt called Tamajhuri and was approaching Banspahari, the driver spotted three persons waving. The driver stopped the bus, mistaking them to be passengers.         
	The three persons then pulled out revolvers and entered the bus. They asked the constables to get down, said an officer. The bus was packed with passengers. We are checking how the abductors came to know that the constables in civvies were among the passengers, he added.        
	Nandigram claim        
	In Nandigram, police sources said late tonight that a Trinamul Congress activist was shot dead by Maoists. However, East Midnapore police superintendent B. Baidya denied such an incident.

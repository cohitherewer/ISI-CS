The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Penalty on train arson village
                                                                                                               Penalty on train arson village
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, Sept. 16: An entire Bihar pocket where a mob torched a train is set to be penalised Rs 3.5 crore under a 1982 collective fine act not invoked so far.        
	It is not known how many persons and villages in and around Bihta station, where four AC coaches were burnt by a mob on August 18, will have to pay the fine that a senior railway police official said he is proposing after a probe.        
	The collective fine is being recommended under the Bihar Collective Fine Act, 1982, which prescribes pecuniary punishment for residents for their failure to do their duty of maintaining public order, said DIG (railways) Arbind Pandey, who conducted the probe.        
	Railway officials said losses from the burning of the four AC coaches of the Shramjivi Express were Rs 3.5 crore  based on the fact that an AC coach costs Rs 80 lakh. Other railway properties were also damaged during the arson.        
	Asked how many will have to pay the fine, the DIG said: The GRP is still in the process of listing the villages and the people concerned.        
	Railway minister Mamata Banerjee had written to Union home minister P. Chidambaram and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar seeking action against the culprits.        
	Police officials said video footage showed the crowd involved in the arson, triggered by action against freeloaders during a ticket-checking drive, consisted of over 300 people. Twenty-seven people have been arrested so far.        
	On the basis of interrogation of some of the culprits, we have been trying to find out who else was there in the crowd, Pandey said.        
	Asked if the Nitish government would accept the rare recommendation for fear of risking a political and poll backlash, Pandey said it was up to the authorities to take a decision.        
	I do not know. It is for the government to decide. But I am making the recommendation which, if implemented, will go a long way in ensuring that troublemakers do not consider attacking (rail) property their right. It will earn a good name for the state.        
	State government officials wouldnt say what their stand would be. Let us receive it (Pandeys report) first, a senior official said.         
	But political workers cutting across party lines said it would be hard for any popular government to take action against an entire area or a cluster of villages.        
	That in large part explains why the 1982 collective fine act has never been used in a state where railway property has been regularly targeted for a variety of reasons.

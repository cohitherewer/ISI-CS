                                                                                                               No coal royalty revision
                            
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 8: The Centre today rejected the states longstanding demand for revision of coal royalty, due since last two years. There is no need to revise coal royalty, Union minister of state for coal Sriprakash Jaiswal said.        
	The royalty amount will go up automatically if there is more production, he said, stressing on the increase in coal output.         
	However, this issue did not figure during his meeting today with chief minister Naveen Patnaik. We didnt discuss the matter at all, said Jaiswal.        
	Later, Naveen said: We will take up the matter with the Finance Commission. He said the 11th and 12th Finance Commissions had recommended for paying compensation for the delay in coal royalty revision. Last week, Naveen had taken up the matter with the Prime Minister in New Delhi.

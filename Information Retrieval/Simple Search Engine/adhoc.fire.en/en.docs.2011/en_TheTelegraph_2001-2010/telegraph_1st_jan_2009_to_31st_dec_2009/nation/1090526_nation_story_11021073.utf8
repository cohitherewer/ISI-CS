The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Iron Man? Aide casts doubts
                                                                                                               Iron Man? Aide casts doubts
          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, May 25: L.K. Advanis closest aide today hinted that the BJPs Iron Man was perhaps not the strong and decisive leader he claimed to be, and that this cost the party in the polls.        
	Sudheendra Kulkarni blamed internal fissures as one of the main reasons for the election defeat and even suggested the BJP lacked unity of command, implying Advanis writ didnt run in the party.        
	Kulkarnis comments, in a newspaper column, come days after he said Advani had been too much of a gentleman to take certain tough decisions after the 2004 defeat, and that they had proved costly in 2009.        
	His claims have added to the confusing whirl of theories that are now making the BJP dizzy as it gropes to explain the election flop.        
	While chief campaign manager Arun Jaitley has taken the safest escape route by blaming the defeat on the third fronts easy surrender to the Congress challenge, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has targeted bad campaign management.        
	Some like Yashwant Sinha, Shahnawaz Hussein and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi have raised questions about ideological issues but others, particularly Vinay Katiyar and Yogi Adityanath, have advocated a higher dose of Hindutva as the recipe for success.        
	There can be no compromise on the Hindi-Hindu-Hindustan agenda, Katiyar said.        
	Kulkarnis theory, however, has generated much curiosity in the party.        
	The internal fissures in this once disciplined and united party were so glaring, both at the central and state levels, that far from attracting new supporters, it disillusioned a significant section of its own committed voters, he wrote.        
	Kulkarni, who virtually ran the show together with Jaitley, added: Even those who abhor the dynastic rule and the culture of sycophancy in the Congress could see that the party scored over the BJP in terms of unity of command.        
	The admission that the fissures could not be repaired and the pointer to the absence of unity of command make nonsense of the BJPs main poll plank of majboot (strong) leadership and nirnayak (decisive) government.        
	By saying the Congress had better unity of command, Kulkarni appears to suggest that the buck stopped with Sonia Gandhi in her party but not with Advani in his.

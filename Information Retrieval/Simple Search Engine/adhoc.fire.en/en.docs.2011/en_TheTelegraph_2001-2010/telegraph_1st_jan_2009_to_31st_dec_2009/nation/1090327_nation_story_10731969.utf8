	 New Delhi: When Indias politicians and Delhis taxi-drivers meet, its the cabbie who ends up getting fleeced.          
	The outstation netas and ticket-seekers thronging the capital in election season have run up lakhs in unpaid cab bills, say the taxi-drivers, most of whom are now avoiding Chanakyapuri, home to 31 state guesthouses.          
	This is how the extortion takes place, according to the cabbies:          akyapuri, a political hub dotted by government quarters and embassies, has several taxi stands. Whenever a guest at a state bhavan needs a cab, the reception dials a local taxi driver.          
	The politicians mostly go to their party headquarters and ask us to wait for them. Often we have to wait more than eight-nine hours, but the netas refuse to pay the waiting charges, said Sanjay, who will be parking his taxi away from the stand till the elections are over.          
	Some refuse to pay even for the distance covered. They tell us to come back later.          
	A survey of 35 taxi-drivers still operating in Chanakyapuri suggested the politicians collectively owed them at least Rs 50,000. Since at least 200 cabbies normally operate in the area, their combined dues should be around Rs 3 lakh.          
	Amarjeet Singh said his politician passengers owed him over Rs 2,000. When I go to the guesthouses to ask for payment, some crony of theirs is always around to shoo me away, Amarjeet said.          
	Once I took a group of netas from UP House, who were either from the Congress or the BSP, on Delhi darshan. They didnt pay me even half of what the meter showed. They kept haggling as if they were buying vegetables. I have stopped going to these guesthouses.          official at Tamil Nadu House confirmed that getting a cab to pick up guests had become close to impossible.          
	All year long these cabbies arrive within 5-10 minutes of a call. But this election season, when most guesthouses here are packed, they are just refusing to turn up. Ive heard allegations about unpaid bills, but I cant obviously confirm that from the guests, he said.          
	A Bihar Bhavan official joked there were now two queues in front of the reception desk  one of cabbies demanding their dues and the other of politicians looking for taxis.          
	 These days even the reception guys tell us to find our own cabs. I had to take a bus to the Congress office, said a ticket-seeker staying at Karnataka Bhavan.

                                                                                                               Daughter killer 
                            
	Toronto, Feb. 3 (PTI): An Indian-origin man has pleaded guilty to strangling and beheading his two-year-old daughter, apparently because of depression over not having a male heir.        
	Lakvinder Kahlon, 48, yesterday admitted to killing Rajvinder, the youngest of his three daughters, in their North Delta home on January 18, 2008.        
	Kahlon got an automatic life sentence. Crown prosecutors Donna Ballyk and Lynette Jung had presented details of the murder: Rajvinder died when she was alone with her father and her mother had stepped out to take the other children to school.        
	Friends said Kahlon was depressed about not having a son. However, his wife Manjit said her husband never complained to her about not having a male child.

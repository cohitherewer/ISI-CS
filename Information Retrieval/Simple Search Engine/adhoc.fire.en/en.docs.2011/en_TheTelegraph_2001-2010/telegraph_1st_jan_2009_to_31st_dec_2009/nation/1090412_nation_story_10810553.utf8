The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Azaadi camp loses Lone
                                                                                                               Azaadi camp loses Lone
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                          Lone in Srinagar on Saturday. (AP)                                  
	Srinagar, April 11: Sajjad Lone, the poster boy of Kashmirs freedom struggle, today decided to contest the general election, becoming the first secessionist in two decades to do so.        
	The 42-year-old, however, kept the azaadi word on his lips. Fighting elections is a change of strategy, not ideology. I am, in my humble capacity, trying to re-orient our struggle and bring it in tune with existing realities as I perceive them, he said at a news conference.        
	I would like to announce Peoples Conference to contest the polls with a commitment to use this mechanism to represent the voice of the Kashmiri people and to take the strengths and merits of our cherished aspirations to the centre-stage of India  where it cannot be ignored. I stand for every word, comma and full stop of what I have always stood for.        
	The Telegraph broke the story that Sajjad would be participating in the elections two months ago.        
	Sajjad will contest from the Baramulla-Kupwara constituency, considered a Peoples Conference stronghold. He is likely to face competition from the National Conference and the Peoples Democratic Party.        
	Sajjad had a tough time explaining his position to journalists at his Sanat Nagar home. They (India) have erected certain barriers like I will have to take oath on the Indian Constitution (to enter Parliament). But I will do that with a heavy heart.        
	The separatists were prompt in crying foul. Even if angels come to fight elections we will ask people to boycott polls, Hurriyat hawk Syed Ali Shah Geelani said.        
	Dukhtaran-e-Millat leader Asiya Andrabi added: He has shown his real face and joined the camp to which he belonged.        
	Sajjad said his decision had already strained his relations with elder brother Bilal, who is a member of the Hurriyat Conferences top executive council.        
	Sajjad had fielded some proxy candidates in the 2002 Assembly elections, inviting opposition from Bilal. The two were not on talking terms for a long time but had patched up two years ago.        
	During last years Assembly poll, Geelani had blamed Sajjad for fielding proxies. Although his sister Shabnum had contested, he had disassociated himself from her and urged people to boycott the elections.        
	Sajjad said the failure of the boycott call was one reason why he had a change of heart. People did not heed my boycott call, so I have to prove my representative character.        
	Today he was heard telling the people: Please vote for me. Dont pre-judge me and pray for my victory. I will not represent India in Kashmir but Kashmir in India.        
	Sajjad said his decision was not a victory for India and a blow to separatism. Separatism is billion times stronger than me.

  - Planning Commission stonewalls HRD ministrys objections; meeting today        CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                     
	New Delhi, Dec. 22: The Planning Commission has stonewalled most objections raised by the human resource development ministry and experts to its blueprint for public-private partnership (PPP) in school education, setting the stage for a possible confrontation.         
	Ahead of a key meet with HRD minister Kapil Sibal and a panel of experts, the commission has circulated a blueprint that has not incorporated objections raised to an earlier draft, top officials told The Telegraph.        
	The meeting, scheduled for tomorrow, was initially planned to vet a revised Planning Commission blueprint that was to incorporate concerns raised by the experts and the HRD ministry.         
	But the talks could now witness panel members and the ministry questioning the commission on why it had only made superficial changes to the blueprint while ignoring substantive concerns, sources said.         
	At a November meeting with the expert panel  set up by the ministry  and Sibal, the Planning Commission had presented a blueprint for PPP investments in school eduction that was largely criticised by present members.         
	The Planning Commission, at a November meeting with the expert panel  set up by the ministry  and Sibal had presented a blueprint for PPP investments in school education that was largely criticised by present members.         
	The UPA has committed to using PPP models of investment  as a supplement for purely government funding  to set up and run schools where a shortage of opportunities exists.         
	However, policy makers and experts are divided on how to implement the commitment, especially as Indias national policy on education (NPE) officially bars profiteering from education  any surplus earned must be ploughed back into education.         
	Any PPP model has to be carefully crafted to provide attractive terms for quality private partners to join the government in setting up high-standard schooling institutions.         
	At the same time, however, the terms must include safeguards to ensure action against any commercialisation  effectively requiring a strict monitoring mechanism that could deter private partners.         
	The ministry is keen to allow private firms attractive terms but is equally determined not to allow any relaxation on its commitment under the NPE. Most panel experts and the ministry have stressed the need for a strong monitoring mechanism.         
	The ministry and panel members in November had expressed concern that an earlier draft prepared by the Planning Commission was riddled with loopholes.         
	These loopholes, they argued, could be used by private partners to minimise their own investment in new schools, relying mostly on government funding, while retaining control of day-to-day management.         
	At the November meeting, the commission was asked by Sibal and other members of the panel to incorporate their concerns in a revised blueprint to be presented at tomorrows meeting.         
	But the panels revised draft has not incorporated the concerns, sources said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 23: The Opposition in the Assembly described the Keonjhar mining scam as the biggest in the state and demanded a CBI probe.        
	The government, however, rejected the demand stating that the ongoing vigilance probe was enough. Infuriated, Opposition Congress and BJP members staged separate walkouts.        
	Earlier, moving an adjournment motion, Opposition chief whip Prasad Harichandan alleged that minerals worth Rs 1 lakh crore had been illegally mined and smuggled out during the Naveen Patnaik regime.        
	Incidentally, Naveen was absent in the House during the debate though he was present during the question answer business in the morning. Ridiculing Naveens claim of providing a transparent administration, Harichandan alleged that the chief minister had closed his eyes to the illegal mining. He was supported by Opposition leader Bhupinder Singh and Congress members S.S. Saluja and Anup Sai. Saluja and Sai demanded a white paper to probe into the irregularities.        
	However, state steel and mines minister Raghunath Mohanty rejected the demand.         
	Vigilance raids have been conducted in mines and four criminal cases have been registered against owners and officials, reminded the minister, adding that as many as 128 mines had been closed down for violation of statutory rules. Supporting the government, BJD legislators questioned the neutrality of CBI probe, citing the instance of Bofors.

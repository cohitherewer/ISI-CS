	Mumbai, Aug. 6: After panic, fraud alert.        
	Mumbai police today said they had received an Interpol advisory saying online cheats might try to sell illegal, unlicensed or fake swine flu medicines through spam mail and websites. They could even steal credit card numbers used while making such purchases.        
	The fraud alert was flashed on a day the state government indicated it could allow private hospitals to carry out flu tests to cope with the rush triggered by the panic over the first death from the disease in Pune on Monday.        
	I feel there is a mad rush to government hospitals for swine flu testing. The government is looking at whether it can permit private hospitals to carry out the testing, chief minister Ashok Chavan told reporters before a cabinet meeting late this evening.        
	Scuffles had broken out yesterday among people waiting outside Naidu Hospital, the only government hospital in the heart of Pune designated for the tests. The panic followed the death of Pune teenager Rida Sheikh, who became Indias first flu fatality.

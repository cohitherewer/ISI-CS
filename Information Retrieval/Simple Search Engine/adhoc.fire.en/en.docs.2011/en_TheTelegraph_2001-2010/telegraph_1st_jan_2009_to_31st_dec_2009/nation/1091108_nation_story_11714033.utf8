	Melbourne, Nov. 7 (PTI): Four international colleges in Australia have suddenly wound up, threatening the future of 2,700 foreign students including Indians, some of whom were about to graduate in two weeks.        
	The students, mostly from India and other Asian countries, were left shell-shocked as they arrived at their campuses yesterday to hear the institutions had closed down permanently. Some 150 Australian students too are affected.        
	In just two weeks, we were going to get our degrees, a student said.        
	They are not professional, they are the people who are dodgy here, another said.        
	Melbourne-based international student Jass Sandhu said she had no information from her college about the closure.        
	Immigration should do something for us. If the college has closed its not our problem. We were studying well we werent left with any dues. What about our future? Sandhu was quoted as saying by the media.        
	Teachers at the colleges, run by the Meridian Group, had been told on Thursday night that they were out of a job, the local media reported without explaining the reasons for the institutions closure.        
	The colleges, located at 13 campuses in Melbourne and Sydney, offered courses in hospitality, design, the English language, fashion and secondary education.

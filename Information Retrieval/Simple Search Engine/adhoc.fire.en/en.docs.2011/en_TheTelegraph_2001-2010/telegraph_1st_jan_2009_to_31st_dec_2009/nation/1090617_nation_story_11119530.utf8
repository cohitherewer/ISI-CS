          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, June 16: The vacation court of Orissa High Court has imposed an injunction on tuition fee hike by the management of Stewart School.        
	Vacation judge B.P. Ray issued the interim stay order on a petition challenging the hike from the current session. The parent of a student had filed the petition.        
	Recently, after a preliminary hearing, the judge had issued notices to the school principal and secretary of the managing board. Among others who were issued notices include the secretary of school and mass education department and director of primary and secondary education. Replies to the notices are expected to be submitted on the second week of July.        
	On March 27, the government had issued an order allowing 25 per cent hike in tuition fees and 15 per cent hike in development fees by managing boards of private English-medium schools, which intend to implement the Sixth Pay Commission recommendations.        
	But the court had issued a stay order on the government notification while imposing restriction on tuition fee hike by DAV schools in Cuttack.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Kasab lawyer shown door
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Kasab lawyer shown door
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                          Abbas Kazmi                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 30: The special court hearing the 26/11 trial today removed Abbas Kazmi as Ajmal Kasabs counsel for non-cooperation, raising questions about whether the lawyer may have wriggled out of the case by deliberately creating a situation that led to his sacking.        
	Abbas Kazmi is not cooperating with the court in the interest of justice. He is trying to drag the trial and is unnecessarily consuming the time of the court. It appears that Kazmi has developed a feeling that he has become indispensable and without him the trial cannot go on, special court judge M.L. Tahaliyani said while dismissing the lawyer, who had been appointed in April.        
	Advocate K.P. Pawar, who had been assisting Kazmi in the case, was appointed the new defence counsel for Kasab, the lone terrorist captured alive during the attacks last year.        
	A court official said Tahaliyani was angered by Kazmis contemplated show of disinterest in the case.         
	The immediate trigger for the termination was Kazmis refusal to consider the courts suggestion to choose the witnesses he would want to cross-examine from a list of 71 out of a total of 340. The lawyer insisted on cross-examining all 340, which the judge said was aimed at delaying the case.        
	This gives out a wrong signal to everyone and it is high time that either Kazmi withdraws from the case himself or the court terminates his appointment, Tahaliyani said.        
	For a man accused of wasting time and failing to co-operate with the court, Kazmi appeared relieved. I am looking for a good nights sleep today, he said.        
	The lawyer, who refused to comment on his dismissal, said he had been trying to give his client as good a defence as possible under trying circumstances.         
	I have been virtually ostracised in society for defending Kasab. In Mahim, where I live with my family, neighbours do not mingle with us much any more. My parents get representations from various Islamic and non-Islamic bodies to stop me from fighting the case. I too am a patriot and thats why I believe Kasab should get a fair trial, he said.        
	Kazmi denied the allegation that he was delaying the case deliberately.        
	Why would I do that? I wanted to finish this case quickly and move on. It affects me financially. I am paid a meagre Rs 2,500 per hearing. Though I am allowed to take up other cases, this case is so high profile and intensive that I do not have time to focus on any other case. So I pass them on to other colleagues. This affects me financially, said Kazmi.        
	Kazmis detractors are using these very issues  the social stigma of defending a terrorist and the financial losses  to suggest that the lawyer was looking for an escape route.         
	Kazmi denied doing anything intentionally but admitted it was getting difficult for him to handle the case.         
	If Kasab asks for books, biryani or itar, I have to tell the court, it is my job. But as soon as I raise it, everybody outside starts giving me nasty looks. On the other hand, I have to handle Kasab  he is moody, sometimes rude and offensive. He does not trust me, he confessed in court without my knowledge, all these have made things difficult for me, Kazmi said.         
	The lawyer said one can still face such humiliation since its part of professional hazards, but asked why no one talked about the uncomfortable truths that had emerged during the course of his cross-examination.        
	Kazmi reminded that his examination of witnesses revealed that a SIM card used by the terrorists was issued to one Suresh Prashad by the Union ministry of urban development. He also mentions the silence of investigators and prosecution on Abu Jindal, whom Kasab has described as an Indian who had trained him.

	Patna, Nov. 13: Curtains came down on Infocom 2009-10 today, with the Bihar government warmly welcoming Bharti Airtel Groups decision to adopt 1,000 state schools and impart communicative English and computer training under its Satya Bharti School Programme.         
	Come, enrich the lives of students, said deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi to Shishir M. Sinha, the groups CEO, when the latter offered to bear the cost of the whole programme. Bihars secretary of IT and health C.K. Mishra, too, thanked Sinha for the offer.         
	This is not the curtain. It is just the beginning of what the Infocom will unveil in days to come, said a programme announcer to thunderous applause from both government functionaries and investors, professionals and academic alike.         
	The final session of the Businessworld and The Telegraph sponsored programme closed with an interactive session. During the session Modi asked state entrepreneurs to be competitive in terms of quality and cost, after Bihar IT Association spokesman P.K. Sinha expressed his apprehension of big fish swallowing up small fries when government opens trade doors to national and global firms.         
	You have to compete. You have to ensure quality product at reasonable prices matching that of your rivals, suggested Modi, while promising: Nitish Kumar has announced that the state will have its IT policy which will try to consider concessions for state firms.        
	Modi also had a word of advice for global firms making their foray into the state. Learn to deal with Indian and Bihar conditions. You may not find the climate or conditions smooth always, but you too have to adapt to the local conditions to do business.        
	Infocom chairman K.K. Mahapatra thanked sponsors including Core Projects amp; Technologies, NIIT, Microsoft, Vayam Technologies, Edu-comp Solutions, Bihar State Hydroelectric Power Corporation, Prognosys, Intel, BEST (Bihar eGovernance Services amp; Technologies Limited), Tata Consultancy Services, Smaarftech Technologies, BSNL, Avaya Global Connect, Zoom Developers and Cybotech.

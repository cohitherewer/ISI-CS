	Bhagalpur, March 1: Railway minister Lalu Prasad today laid the foundation stone of a proposed railway division headquarters at Bhagalpur.        
	The town of Bhagalpur falls under the Malda division (Bengal) of Eastern Railway. However, Lalu Prasad recently gifted this small, but politically significant, place its own headquarters along with a Rajdhani Express and a Garib Rath after the interim railway budget.         
	Though happy with the decision, residents are little confused.        
	They are now richer with a Rajdhani and a Garib Rath at their service, but are clueless about the location of the proposed headquarters. Reason: no plot survey has been undertaken till date and no jurisdiction has been earmarked for it.        
	But, Lalu Prasad promises that his railway ministry has found the right 40-50 acres at Bhagalpur for the proposed headquarters  the location of which remains a mystery.         
	And his next statement at todays function has left people more confused.         
	If we dont have the plot, then the railways would purchase it from farmers, he said.         
	His opposition has been crying foul over the headquarters promise, calling it a pre-poll game.         
	BJP MP from Bhagalpur Shahnawaz Hussain has accused Lalu of using the Indian Railways as RJDs campaigning vehicle.         
	I boycotted todays function, as did many more politicians, as the railway minister has begun to use the railway resources for his poll campaigns, he alleged.         
	Lalu is not the only one. The RJD MP from Khagaria, R.K. Rana, put another ambiguous railway project in motion on February 28, on behalf of Lalu.         
	The MP laid the foundation stones for a concrete sleeper plant and a railway footbridge at Khagaria.        
	The MP was in such a rush to get his work done, that he completed formalities by 7.30am, while the ceremony was scheduled to start from 9.00am, leaving those who came to witness the event, disappointed.        
	A day before (February 27), his chief and the railway minister had laid the foundation stone for a portion of a road-cum-railway bridge across the Ganga at Munger a project that was earlier inaugurated by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee in 2004.         
	On the same day, agriculture minister Taslimuddin laid the foundation stone for a proposed railway link from Kishanganj to Jalalgar at Kishanganj railway station on behalf of his RJD boss.        
	If Lalu Prasad and his henchmen have remained busy, chief minister Nitish Kumar and his NDA-led government has not been lying low either.         
	Nitish, too, has had his calendar full with such development projects  worth crores  up his sleeves in the flood-ravaged Kosi region.         
	On the same day when Rana was flagging off two railway projects, Nitish was busy laying the foundation stone for a proposed bridge over the Kosi at Mahishi in Sapaul.         
	The bridge is slated to come up at an estimated cost of Rs 458 crore and would connect Mithilaanchal to the Kosi area.         
	This bridge would reduce the 67km stretch between Darbhanga and Kosi considerably, the chief minister has promised.         
	Besides, Nitish has als inaugurated 110 schemes worth Rs 120 crore at Madhepura and welfare packages worth Rs 403 crore at Sapaul.         
	He has also instructed officials to clear all dues and demands of floods victims, immediately.         
	Observers however have been left unmoved by the slew of projects.         
	Take a look at any local newspapers before the elections and one can see full-page advertisements of projects and schemes. Politicians rain projects over Bhagalpur before the polls, only to forget the town later, said an observer.

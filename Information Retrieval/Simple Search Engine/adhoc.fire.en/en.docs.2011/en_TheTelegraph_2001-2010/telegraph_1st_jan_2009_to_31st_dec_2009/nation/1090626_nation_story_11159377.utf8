The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CM talks terror with army boss
                                                                                                               CM talks terror with army boss
                            
	Bhubaneswar, June 25 (PTI): Worried over the spurt in Maoist attacks in Orissa, chief minister Naveen Patnaik today met top army officers of the Central Command, triggering speculation that the state may be seeking army assistance in tackling the rebel problem.        
	We are ready to provide any kind of help to the state it wants, said Lt General J.K. Mohanty, the commanding officer of the Indian Armys central command, while talking to reporters after the meeting in the evening.        
	On the possible army intervention in Koraput, he said that would be a political decision.         
	The meeting assumes significance as it came hours before the commencement of the two-day visit of Union home minister P. Chidambaram to the state and especially to Koraput, where Maoists struck in a big way attacking a railway station some 30km from Koraput.        
	The rebels also damaged communication towers and looted a block office in Koraput district.        
	The army officer, however, said Orissa was doing well in tackling the Maoist menace by raising special striking force comprising ex-servicemen.         
	During his tour, Chidambaram was scheduled to visit Nalcos bauxite mines at Panchpatmali hills at Damonjodi in Koraput, which was attacked by Maoist on April 12.        
	Koraput continues to emerge as the disturbed area in the state with Maoist launching series of attacks there.         
	While keeping Narayanpatna cut off from rest of the country by blocking roads, Maoists had killed at least nine security personnel in a landmine blast on June 18 and attacked three police establishments in Koraput district on June 7.        
	Though 11 days had passed since Maoists blocked roads to Narayanpatna, no attempt was made to clear trees from roads after killing of nine security personnel.        
	To a query, Lt Gen Mohanty said the army was now training personnel of Orissas elite anti-naxal force Special Operation Group (SOG) and other police personnel.         
	On the proposed army base in Orissa, he said the state government would give a complete project report on the matter.        
	Patnaik, however, said that possible army intervention intoNaxalite problem did not figure during his discussion with the senior army officer.

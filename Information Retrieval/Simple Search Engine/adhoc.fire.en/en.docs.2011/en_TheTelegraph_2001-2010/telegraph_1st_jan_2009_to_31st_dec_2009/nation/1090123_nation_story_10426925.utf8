The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Row over bravery award
                                                                                                               Row over bravery award
          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, Jan. 22: For the son of a bureaucrat, jumping off an autorickshaw not only means saving his own life but also being nominated for a bravery award.        
	Siddhartha Jha, a child development project officer in Sarguja district, recommended state bravery award for his son Vivek for apparently saving seven children who were trapped when the autorickshaw in which they were travelling turned turtle on December 23 last year.        
	But the reality is quite different from the story Jha cooked up. The driver, Sunil Kumar, said that his autorickshaw CG15 A 6071 developed technical snag and no such accident took place that turned the vehicle turtle. Actually, Vivek  a Class VII student in Ambikapur, about 350km from here  fell from the vehicle and sustained minor injuries while returning from tuition class.         
	Surprisingly, the FIR of the accident was lodged on January 16 after the names of bravery award recipients were announced. The FIR was lodged later, as the award committee wanted a copy of the report, Ambikapur city superintendent of police Manisha Thakur said. However, the Kotwali police, who are investigating the matter, failed to collect any evidence to establish such an accident.

	Ahmedabad, July 11: The death of over 109 people from drinking spurious liquor in a dry state like Gujarat has raised questions about the relevance of prohibition.        
	Critics of the law in the land of Mahatma Gandhi say prohibition, in force in the state since it was formed in 1960, has merely driven liquor underground. Bootlegging is rampant and illegal liquor dens have flourished, and the latest tragedy in Ahmedabad is the eighth in the state since 1977.        
	The BJP government has set up a four-member commission, headed by retired high court judge Kamal Mehta, to probe the deaths and suggest, by November 30, how to effectively enforce prohibition.        
	Yet two similar commissions, appointed after hooch tragedies in 1978 and 1989, had recommended the prohibition policy be done away with or modified to stop hooch deaths.        
	Prohibition is a sensitive issue in the state. Both the Congress and the BJP officially say the policy should continue but, in private, many politicians question its relevance in todays India.        
	People should be allowed to decide for themselves. The law is archaic and should be done away with, said Sunil Parikh, adviser to ratings agency Crisil and former president of the Gujarat chapter of the Confederation of Indian Industry.        
	A few years ago, chief minister Narendra Modi had relaxed prohibition norms for the proposed special economic zones to attract investment, drawing howls of protest from Gandhians and social workers.        
	As in other prohibition states such as Mizoram, Nagaland and Manipur, anyone over 40 in Gujarat can apply for a liquor permit on health grounds, securing a monthly ration of one bottle of hard liquor or 10 bottles of beer. The Modi government, however, introduced other changes to the law.        
	To encourage corporate houses to hold business conferences in Gujarat instead of going over to nearby Mount Abu (Rajasthan) or Diu, the government allowed group permits so that delegates could drink liquor at hotels. Also, anyone coming from non-prohibition states or abroad is allowed one bottle of liquor.        
	However, these permits are expensive, so people prefer to buy from bootleggers. For example, a bottle of whisky costs Rs 1,000 in permit shops, which are located in select hotels. But a bootlegger sells the same brand for Rs 750.        
	Prohibition has forged a nexus between some policemen and bootleggers, leading to the rise of gangsters like Abul Latif, who controlled a Rs 1,000-crore business in illicit liquor till his death in a police encounter in 1997.        
	Several areas in Surat, Valsad and north Gujarat adjoining Rajasthan, from where the liquor comes in, became lucrative for policemen and postings there were said to have been auctioned.              
	Social activists and Gandhians, however, remain staunch votaries of the law. Do we change the Indian Penal Code just because the police fail to prevent crimes? said activist Ilaben Pathak.        
	Gandhian Chuni Vaidya, 95, said those like him were fighting a losing battle since there was no political will to enforce prohibition.        
	The laws critics say that it is depriving the state of revenues. They point to Andhra Pradesh, where N.T. Rama Rao had introduced prohibition in 1994 to win over women tired of their husbands frittering money on alcohol. But the state lost revenues of Rs 1,300 crore in one year while bootlegging flourished.        
	In 1995, then chief minister Chandrababu Naidu partially withdrew prohibition. Country liquor continued to be banned but sale of Indian-Made Foreign Liquor was allowed.        
	Gujarat can have a similar provision. Arrack is banned in Andhra even now, but companies manufacturing IMFL have been allowed to introduce cheaper brands of whisky, rum and vodka for low-income households, said a political leader who did not wish to be named.

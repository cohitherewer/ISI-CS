          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 16: The defence ministry is set to begin political consultations on the viability of creating the office of a chief of defence staff (CDS) as the most important military adviser to the government.        
	Defence minister A.K. Antony said in Parliament today that the government had approved the recommendations of a group of ministers report on reforming the national security system that was presented nearly eight years back in February 2001.        
	But the government did not take a view on the recommendation on creating the institution of a CDS.        
	It said that the Centre will decide after consulting the political parties. The defence minister has written to leaders of political parties for their views.        
	The first of the letters to political parties was written in 2007, two years ago. The report that recommended the creation of the CDS was presented in the wake of the Kargil war of 1999.        
	The idea of a CDS is appreciated at a conceptual level but even the armed forces do not have a common practical recommendation on it.         
	This is because in the multiple security threat perceptions  internal security, land, sea and air borders  within which the armed forces operate, one or the other service gains primacy.

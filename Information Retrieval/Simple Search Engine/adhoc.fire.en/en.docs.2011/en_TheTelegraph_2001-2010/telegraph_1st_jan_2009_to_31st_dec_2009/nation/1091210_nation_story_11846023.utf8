          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 9: Arun Jaitley targeted Justice M.S. Liberhans credentials today, suggesting his appointment as commission head owed to his connections, questioning his knowledge of English and wondering how much of the report he had authored.        
	The leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha spoke for over an hour as the House debated the commission report. Probably to project a moderate image, he did not stress the RSS line unlike Rajnath Singh and Sushma Swaraj in the Lok Sabha, nor did he overstate the secular-communal case.        
	P. Chidambaram and Kapil Sibal laughed when Jaitley wondered how Liberhan, who got 48 extensions through the 17 years he headed the commission, could recommend that no bureaucrat should get a post-retirement job and asked if the government proposed to act on it.        
	A junior judge of Punjab and Haryana High Court is picked to head the commission. The only credentials of the judge at the time of his appointment was his proximity to the then law minister, Jaitley said.        
	It has been frequently said there are two categories of judges  those who know the law and those who know the law minister. This judge fell in the latter category.        
	Jaitley added: The apprehension that the report is drafted by a person other than the judge himself is strengthened by the observation on page 999 where the judge thanks one Shri Harpreet Singh Giani and credits him (with) helping the judge in analysing the evidence, coming to conclusions, editing the report, adding and modifying the language, adding and modifying the ideas and clearing the mess created by others.        
	The judge seems only to have the done the rest, if anything remained.        
	Saying Liberhans knowledge of the Queens language was somewhat limited, Jaitley described the report as the first example of judgment outsourcing. The language is not judicial. The judge has expressed an opinion on a variety of political subjects completely outside the terms of reference and outside the scope of judicial training, Jaitley alleged. His principal charges were:        
	Liberhan has not given any evidence of the conspiracy he has alleged.        
	The report is a compilation of howlers and mistakes. Among examples he cited were Veer Savarkar being called the RSS founder (it was K.B. Hedgewar), and the attribution of a Jinnah quote to Deen Dayal Upadhyay.        
	The report is biased against Hindutva, regionalism and backward caste empowerment.         
	Liberhan has ticked off constitutional authorities including the Supreme Court. The judge is a bitter man. He was extremely keen to be elevated to the Supreme Court.

	Calcutta, June 26: A central minister today said peoples frustration over lack of development was at the root of the tension in Lalgarh.        
	Subodh Kant Sahay, Union minister for food processing and industry, said the Bengal government wasnt able to spend central funds on social sector schemes.         
	Lots of funds go back to the Centre as the state is unable to spend it on people, Sahay said on the sidelines of the AGM of the Indian Chamber of Commerce today. The minister criticised the state for not creating enough employment opportunities.        
	Sahay spoke after Bengal finance minister Asim Dasgupta had addressed the meeting where he spoke of Aila relief. Trinamuls Saugata Ray, Union minister of state for urban development, also spoke but didnt touch on Lalgarh.

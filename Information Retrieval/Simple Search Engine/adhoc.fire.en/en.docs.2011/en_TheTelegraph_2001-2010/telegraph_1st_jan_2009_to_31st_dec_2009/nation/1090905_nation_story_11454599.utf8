	 New Delhi, Sept. 4: Teachers in two IITs are planning to go on a hunger strike tomorrow to protest the absence of any commitment from the Centre in response to pay demands and a perceived snub from the education minister.           
	Faculty at IIT Bombay and IIT Kharagpur today decided to go ahead with the strike they had planned during protests over the past fortnight over a controversial new pay regime.           
	The protest had been called off after HRD officials assured the faculty that Kapil Sibal would meet their representatives on September 7. The ministry has now called off the meeting because Sibal has a tight schedule that day.           
	But IIT faculty allege they had been trying to meet Sibal for the past fortnight and their requests had been spurned.                   
	 Shimla: The 475km Manali-Leh highway has been closed because of early heavy snowfall. The highway is open only between June and mid-September when snow is cleared by the Border Roads Organisation.                  
	 New Delhi: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat called on Atal Bihari Vajpayee on Friday, capping the round of meetings he has held with BJP after signalling that the Sangh would intervene to pull its political progeny out of the crises it is saddled with. Vajpayees secretary N.C. Jhingta said the RSS chief had come to ask after his health and discuss the political situation.                  
	 New Delhi (PTI): CBI sources said on Friday that Aarushis vaginal swabs had been substituted with those of an unidentified woman. Dr Sunil Dohere, who had drawn the swabs following Arushis murder on May 15, 2008, had reported that they contained a white discharge, suggestive of seminal fluid. But no semen was found in the slides sent to the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and Diagnostics in Hyderabad.                   
	 Coimbatore (PTI): A Class XII student has allegedly committed suicide by jumping from the terrace of her three-storeyed school building in Coimbatore. The girl killed herself as she was caught copying during a test, police said.

	Patna, Dec. 1: A law official in Chhapra fell prey to lawlessness today.        
	Harendra Prashad Sharma, an additional public prosecutor, was beaten to death in the north Bihar town after a dispute over a leaky stove turned violent.         
	Police said Sharma complained about the smell of smoke from a stove in his neighbours house at Katahribagh under the Town police station. Infuriated at the complaint, the neighbour, Chandrama Prasad, and four of his family members launched a ferocious attack on Sharma and his two sons with sticks, knife and sharp utensils.        
	All the five were arrested and sent to jail, the police said.

          SANJAY K. JHA                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 21: The trust deficit between the Congress and the NCP that has clouded alliance talks for the Maharashtra polls now imperils prospects of a joint campaign.         
	Despite the NCPs pressure and the concurrence of a section of state Congress leaders, there is uncertainty over whether the allies will canvass together. Some senior leaders are averse to the idea of a joint manifesto, too.        
	Although state Congress chief Manikrao Thakre today spoke of a joint campaign, another senior leader said no decision has been taken.        
	We dont see the possibility of a joint campaign. At best, we can accept one rally to be jointly addressed by Sonia Gandhi and Sharad Pawar. But the state leaders will manage the entire electioneering separately, he added.        
	NCP leader Praful Patel however, asserted, that there would be a joint campaign as well as a joint manifesto.        
	The NCP, not in the best of health at this juncture, is eager to tap the popularity of Sonia and Rahul Gandhi. But Congress sources say the party has drawn up a campaign plan and the NCP doesnt figure in it.         
	The Congress had set up its manifesto-drafting committee long back and the document is ready for printing. Sources said only last-minute changes ordered by Sonia could derail the plan.         
	Congress leaders feel important ministries held by the NCP in the current state coalition  home, power and energy  had become the prime source of embarrassment and there was no point in bearing the cross for them. Congress campaign committee chairman Vilasrao Deshmukh is seen as a diehard Pawar baiter who will try to forestall joint electioneering.        
	The stance of Deshmukh, the only Congress leader with a state-wide appeal and who is sought after by most candidates to campaign, has the support of most central leaders.         
	The alliance is likely to be formally announced tomorrow, with the differences narrowing down to just four seats.         
	Sources said the Congress had finalised candidates for all the 174 seats it plans to contest. Although relatives of senior Congress leaders will get the ticket, President Pratibha Patils son Rajendra Shekhawat is unlikely to get a ticket from Amravati  the seat of his choice.

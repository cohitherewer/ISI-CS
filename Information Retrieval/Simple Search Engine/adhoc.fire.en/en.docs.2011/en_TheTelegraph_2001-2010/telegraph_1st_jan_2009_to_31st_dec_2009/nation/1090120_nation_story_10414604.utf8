The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | EC asked to draft exit poll rules
                                                                                                               EC asked to draft exit poll rules
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 19: The Supreme Court today authorised the Election Commission to frame and implement guidelines banning exit/opinion polls from the time voting begins till its end.        
	The order comes at a time general elections are looming and a law banning exit polls is yet to be put in place.        
	Under the poll panels 1998 guidelines, a ban on exit and opinion polls kicks in two days before voting begins and lasts an hour after the last phase of polling.        
	But a chance remark by the top court that the government, not the poll panel, should bring in a law resulted in it suspending the guidelines.        
	The Rajya Sabha has passed a bill banning exit polls but the lower House is yet to clear it. It is unlikely to be passed in next months session to clear the vote-on-account.         
	When hearing resumed in the case today, the poll panel was told it could frame and implement its own guidelines in the meantime.         
	Panel counsel Meenakshi Arora said unregulated exit polls after the initial phases of polling influenced voters in subsequent stages.        
	There is thus a need to curtail them till after the last phase of polling. Especially, since elections are now held at a staggered phase, she said.        
	A bench headed by headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan then observed: Theres no such bar (on drawing up exit poll guidelines) on the Election Commission.

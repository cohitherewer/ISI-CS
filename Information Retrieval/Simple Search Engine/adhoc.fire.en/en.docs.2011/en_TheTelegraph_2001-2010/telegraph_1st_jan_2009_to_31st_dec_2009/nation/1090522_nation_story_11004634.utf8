          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, May 21: Students of Oriya-medium schools under West Bengal Board of Secondary Education will soon receive the first lot of textbooks translated and scripted in Oriya. So far, students in Oriya schools in Bengal had been reading Bengali books, answering Bengali question papers, but writing tests in Oriya.         
	There is a large section of Oriya people in industrial areas of Bengal and many of them send their children to Oriya-medium schools. To ease the pressure on the students to learn Bengali, state-run Odiya Bhasha Pratishthan has come to their rescue.         
	The printing is on. In a months time the Pratishthan will be sending 20,000 books of 10 subjects  all printed in Oriya, said director of Pratisthan, Prafulla Kumar Rath.         
	The textbooks would be available to students of Classes VI, VII and VIII. In 2006, Hooghly-based Kashinath Memorial Trust intervened and wrote to Odiya Bhasha Pratisthan to supply to Oriya-medium schools free textbooks that were being offered by the state in government-run schools in Orissa.        
	The Pratisthan then wrote to the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education seeking permission for translating the approved books.         
	Permission granted, Orissa Primary Education Programme Authority provided a financial assistance of Rs 7.22 lakh for the printing of textbooks. Teachers from Bengal were assigned with the task of translation and we had the manuscript ready, said Rath giving credit to social activist Srikant Panda for his effort in the project.         
	The books will meet the demands of six high schools and 30 primary schools having 560 students in each class.

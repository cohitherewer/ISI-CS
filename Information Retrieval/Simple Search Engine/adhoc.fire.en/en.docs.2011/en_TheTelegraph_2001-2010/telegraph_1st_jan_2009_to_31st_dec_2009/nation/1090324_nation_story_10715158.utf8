  - Sonia harps on stability at campaign kick-off but cant resist jab at new combine        AJAY SUKUMARAN                          Sonia Gandhi salutes party workers at a rally in Davanagere, 260km from Bangalore, on Monday. (PTI)                                        
	Davanagere (Karnataka), March 23: Sonia Gandhi today kicked off her partys election campaign on the twin planks of stability and development from a BJP-ruled state, a message that the Congress does not consider the third front its chief opponent yet.        
	This election is for a stable government, the Congress president told a rally in Davanagere, 260km north of Bangalore, where the party had launched its successful 1999 campaign for the Assembly elections.         
	The Congress also sees a significant voter base in Karnataka, having polled more votes than the BJP in the 2008 state polls though it won fewer seats.        
	The party shares a special relationship with the southern state. Indira Gandhi had begun her stunning comeback after the 1977 debacle from Chikmagalur by winning a by-election the following year. In 1999, Sonia herself had contested and won from Bellary in what had been billed as a big-bang contest against the BJPs Sushma Swaraj but which ended with the Congress chief crushing her opponent.         
	Sonia said it was time for the people to decide between the Congress and the BJP.         
	I hear there is another front coming up. It has as many prime ministerial candidates as there are parties, she said in her first public comments on the third front, whose leaders had formally come together earlier this month at Tumkur, also in Karnataka.         
	Who knows when, who and where and along with whom they will remain, Sonia told the gathering of over a lakh, speaking in Hindi as she read out from a written speech.        
	The front, a conglomeration of parties opposed to the Congress and the BJP, is being forged by the Left constituents and regional groupings such as the Telugu Desam, Janata Dal (Secular), Telangana Rashtra Samiti and Haryana Janahit Congress.        
	Sonia, who spoke for about 25 minutes, took on the BJP for its divisive politics, but refrained from mentioning the Mangalore attacks by the Hindutva moral police or raids on churches in some pockets. It is a matter of sorrow that, for some time now, in this great land (Karnataka) unity has been threatened, she said.        
	Clad in a cream sari, Sonia came to the rally site in a helicopter from Hubli around 1.20pm.         
	The rally was named Bharat Nirman, after the United Progressive Alliances rural infrastructure development programme launched in 2005.         
	The Congress is seeking votes on its welfare and development policies such as the Rs 71,000-crore farm loan waiver it implemented in July 2008.        
	The rally also aims to project unity in the partys state unit, which has long been dogged by internal bickering. The Congress is yet to announce its list of candidates for the states 28 Lok Sabha seats.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | For sons sake, a new House
                                                                                                               For sons sake, a new House
          GAJINDER SINGH                              
	Chandigarh, June 14: Wanted, a House for the chief ministers son.        
	Except that its not just any old house but an Upper House of the state legislature.        
	Punjabs ruling Shiromani Akali Dal wants to revive the states legislative council just so that Sukhbir Singh Badal can hang on to his post of deputy chief minister.        
	Sukhbir, son of chief minister Parkash Singh Badal, was appointed to the job on January 21 and must resign if he cannot get elected to the legislature before July 20. His problem is that the two vacant Assembly seats, Banur and Jalalabad, are due for bypolls only in September and November.        
	So the solution the Akali Dal is mulling is: somehow fast-track the formation of a legislative council (Vidhan Parishad) in a month and get Sukhbir elected to it. The chief minister has hinted the matter would be raised in the cabinet soon.        
	A makeshift Upper House can be started quickly in a rented building with a large hall and a room for a library. But it also means appointing a large staff and arranging security.        
	Then, the bill will include the members salaries and perks, including official cars and personal guards  not to speak of the headache of finding official accommodation for them.        
	Getting Sukhbir into the House would not be a problem for the ruling party, though, because the Assembly has the most votes in the indirect poll.        
	Theres no legal obstacle to setting up the council. After the 40-member Punjab council was abolished in January 1970, the state sent two resolutions, in 1976 and 1993, for its revival and the Union cabinet cleared the proposal in 1997. The only reason successive state governments have waited till now is a lack of funds.        
	Most states have abolished their Upper House, and only six have them now.

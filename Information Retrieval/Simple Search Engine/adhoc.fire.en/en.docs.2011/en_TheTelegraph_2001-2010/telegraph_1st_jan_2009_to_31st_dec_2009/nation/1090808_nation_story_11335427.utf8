          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 7: The President will inaugurate the Armed Forces Tribunal tomorrow, a body to which all disputes in the military services will be referred.        
	There are more than 9,000 cases concerning military personnel pending in court, including some over matters of life and death after court martial sentences passed on soldiers who had allegedly killed colleagues or superiors.        
	These cases will now be transferred to the tribunal that will be headed by a retired Supreme Court judge. The principal bench of the tribunal will be in New Delhi and there will be eight regional benches.         
	The tribunal will have 15 courts  three each in New Delhi, Chandigarh and Lucknow and one each in Jaipur, Mumbai, Calcutta, Guwahati, Chennai and Kochi.        
	It will serve more than 2.5 million serving and retired military personnel.        
	A defence ministry statement today said: The men in uniform will have another reason to cheer when their long-pending demand for justice becomes a reality with the launch of the Armed Forces Tribunal tomorrow.        
	Defence minister A.K. Antony had asked for the tribunal to be set up by June 1 last year. Parliament passed the bill to set up the tribunal in December 2007.        
	The government has appointed eight judicial members and 15 administrative members.

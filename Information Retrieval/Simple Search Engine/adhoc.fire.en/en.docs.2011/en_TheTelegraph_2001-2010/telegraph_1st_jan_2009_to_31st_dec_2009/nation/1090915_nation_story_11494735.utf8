          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 14: Delhi High Court has acquitted a Pakistani sentenced to death for killing a constable at a CRPF camp, saying the intruders nationality and illegal presence in India were not enough to send him to the gallows.        
	The judgment of the trial court appeared to have been coloured by the fact that the accused was a national of Pakistan, a two-judge bench of the high court said in its ruling last Monday, clearing Maqsood Ahmed of all terror charges.        
	According to the prosecution, a constable who survived the 11pm attack on October 18, 2001, had come out of his barracks and flashed his torch after being jolted out of sleep by sound of gunfire.        
	The beam had illuminated the face of the fleeing Maqsood, constable L.H. Fernandes had said. Fernandes later found an injured constable Nitin Puttewar, who died on the way to hospital.        
	A militant later admitted to police that he had shot a CRPF constable there.

                                                                                                               Seminary seal on Fiza talaaq 
                            
	Muzaffarnagar, March 15 (PTI): The talaaq by Chand Mohammed over phone and through a text message may be unacceptable to Fiza, but leading seminary Dar-ul Uloom has said it is legal under Muslim law.         
	Talaaq, uttered thrice, is legal under the Shariat and Fiza is free to marry another man... after the passing of the three-month iddat period, said the in-charge of the seminarys fatwa department, Mufti Ahsan Kasmi. A divorce is not necessary if Chand reconverts to Hinduism.        
	A member of a Shariat court, Mufti Zulfikar, also said the talaaq was legal.        
	Chand alias Chander Mohan, Haryanas former deputy chief minister, yesterday divorced Fiza from the UK. But she refused to accept it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bill to nail corrupt leaders, officials
                                                                                                               Bill to nail corrupt leaders, officials
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, March 3: The Assembly today passed what was described as a historic anti-corruption bill.        
	The Bihar Special Court Bill, 2009  after getting nod from the legislative council, the governor and clearance of its certain clauses by the Centre  would later take shape of an act, strengthening the legal teeth of the government to take on corrupt public servants.        
	The government would set up a special court under the act to carry out fast trial against the accused persons within the stipulated timeframe. Importantly, the act would empower the state to seize or confiscate the assets disproportionate to the accused persons known source of income within 30 days of the investigating agency concerned lodging a DA case against the persons concerned.        
	Chief minister Nitish Kumar said that the existing laws were insufficient for nailing corrupt bureaucrats and ministers requiring upon the government to introduce the new bill.         
	Nitish added that he was aware about the corruption among public servants and anger among people against it in advance. But I encountered the wrath among people against corrupt bureaucrats and elected representatives in course of my vikas yatra, Nitish said, adding: My experience during the vikas yatra inspired me to introduce this bill so soon.        
	The employees of the central sector do not fall in the purview of the bill.         
	But IAS and IPS officers enjoy certain privileges, for the states investigating agencies are required to secure sanction from the Union personnel and home ministries to prosecute them. But this bill has effectively ended this privilege, empowering the special court set up under it to try and prosecute the public servants.

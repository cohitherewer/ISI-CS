                                                                                                               Kaminey petition reaches HC 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, Sept. 14: The wrangle over a certain graffiti shown in the Hindi film Kaminey has finally reached Orissa High Court.        
	The scene that has managed to offend both sevayats of the 12th Century Puri Jagannath Temple and Lord Jagannaths devotees alike, shows a graffiti that reportedly mentions the lords name in bad taste.         
	Adding to the controversy, the graffiti is placed beneath the picture of a barely clad model.        
	Protestors had burnt down posters of the Priyanka Chopra and Shahid Kapoor-starrer and had staged demonstrations in several parts of the state since the film released last month.        
	Dilip Das, of Neelachakra, an outfit that often doubles up as the states moral and cultural police, filed a PIL in the high court, seeking a directive to expunge the scene from the film as it attacks the religious sentiments of devotees of Lord Jagannath.        
	Kaminey has been in the thick of controversy since the past month when Puri Shankaracharya Nischalananda Saraswati demanded that the film be banned. He also sought an unconditional apology from its the makers for including the scene with the graffiti.         
	The Shankaracharya, who also sought the intervention of Union home minister P. Chidambaram, urged people across the country to come forth and protest attempts to denigrate Hindu gods.         
	The controversy snowballed further when a case was registered under Section 295-A of the Indian Penal Code against Kaminey at Puri town police station.         
	It was registered on the basis of an FIR filed against the films producers, UTV Motion Pictures Limited, and director Vishal Bharadwaj by Jagannath Sena Sangathan, a cutural and religious group, on August 24.        
	Meanwhile, the state administration has apparently ensured that the objectionable portions were deleted before the film was shown in cinemas across the state.

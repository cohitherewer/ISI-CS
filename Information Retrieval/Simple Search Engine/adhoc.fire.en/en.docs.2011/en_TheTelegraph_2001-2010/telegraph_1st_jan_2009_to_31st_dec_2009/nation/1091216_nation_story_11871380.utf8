	Copenhagen, Dec. 15: A revised blueprint of a possible climate accord, representing a last-ditch effort to save a failing climate change summit, today generated even more criticism from the developing country delegates.        
	The blueprint, outlining three options for long-term climate aid from the industrialised to the developing countries, is intended to form the core of a political agreement for heads of states to endorse later this week.         
	The draft is a watered-down version of a text released five days ago by the Ad Hoc Working Group on Long Term Co-operation  one of two negotiating tracks at the conference. The revision has proposed financial resources and more action to help the developing countries adapt to climate change and has removed all the contentious issues in the earlier version.        
	But developing country delegates condemned the revision. This is an eyewash. There is nothing in terms of long-term finance for developing countries, Quamrul Chowdhury, a Bangladeshi envoy and co-ordinator for the group of Least Developed Countries on financial issues, told The Telegraph here.        
	Essentially, it is a joke. Every contentious paragraph --- including the bracketed text (on which there is no consensus) covering targets, funding, monitoring and verification, and the long-term goals  has simply been removed and replaced with the placeholder to be elaborated.        
	Most of the provisions in the draft to which Indias environment minister Jairam Ramesh had aired his opposition have been removed as well as the opposition from the developed countries regarding emission cut targets, said a climate policy analyst with the Centre for Science and Environment, an NGO, who is here as an observer.        
	After the draft was released on Friday, Ramesh had not said anything specific on the revised text but indicated that efforts were on to come up with a political agreement at Copenhagen and that a legally binding document would only come later.        
	The talks between the developed and the developing countries resumed today after breaking down yesterday on the issue of whether the 12-year-old, legally binding Kyoto Protocol would continue.         
	The lack of progress in the negotiations appears to have dampened the hopes of an agreement emerging from Copenhagen  even within the UN climate agency. If we continue at this rate, were not going to make it, said Yvo de Boer, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.         
	Nearly 100 world leaders, including President Barack Obama, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, are expected to arrive here before the close of the summit on December 18.

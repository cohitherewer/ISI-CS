The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Desert lock, keys in Mumbai
                                                                                                               Desert lock, keys in Mumbai
          RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR                          The barricaded RCA office in Jaipur                                  
	Jaipur, Sept. 23: The tussle for Rajasthan cricket has shifted from the locked-up premises of the state association to the power corridors of the games controlling board in Mumbai.        
	Members of the rival factions  those of Rajasthan State Cricket Association (RCA) chief Sanjay Dixit and the group of Lalit Modi loyalists which claims to be in majority  have reached Mumbai for tomorrows annual general meeting of the BCCI, each claiming they have the right to represent the state.        
	Dixit, who defeated Modi as RCA chief in a bitterly fought election in March, is legally eligible to attend the BCCI meeting. But his opponents insist that Rajendra Singh Rathore, who they appointed acting officiating president on Sunday, should represent Rajasthan.         
	The drama over cricket control began yesterday when the rival faction locked in around seven or eight henchmen allegedly employed by Dixit to prevent his opponents from entering the RCA offices in Jaipur. The men remained locked-in through the night, but are said to have made a secret exit sometime today. However, the RCA offices at the Sawai Man Singh Stadium remain locked with police home guards stationed outside.        
	Satur Choudhary, one of the guards, said: We do not know whether the men are inside or not but yes, the locks are on both gates.        
	Rathore said the deadlock would continue. The key is with us. We have heard the men inside have been brought out secretly. The locks will remain on the gate till somebody requests us to open them, he said from Mumbai.        
	The rival camp had held an annual general meeting on Sunday in Jaipur and passed a no-confidence motion against Dixit, accusing him of being autocratic. Claiming the support of 20 of the states 33 district cricket associations, the Modi loyalists called for elections on October 14.         
	The faction of Modi supporters, among them Rathore, acting officiating secretary Giriraj Shandilya, former RCA chairman Subhash Joshi and former deputy president Bimal Soni, are in Mumbai. Sources said they planned to meet Modi.        
	Dixit is expected to reach Mumbai tomorrow, but his close aide Vivek Vyas is already in the city. I will be going to Mumbai and will represent Rajasthan, but I will not reveal my strategy to the media, Dixit said.        
	The anti-Dixit faction met Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot today and pressed for forming an ad-hoc committee.         
	Gehlot, who has so far refused to be drawn into the controversy, is said to be concerned about the one-day international against Australia scheduled for October 25. Sources said he could ask the groups to file their complaint with the registrar of cooperative societies, who would then take a decision.        
	The registrar can adjudicate sports disputes under the Rajasthan Sports Act, 2005, a law which many say was passed by the Vasundhara Raje government at Modis behest.        
	Under the law, the voting rights of the 59 RCA members were taken away and instead only 32 district cricket associations were empowered to vote, which facilitated Modis victory in the RCA elections then.

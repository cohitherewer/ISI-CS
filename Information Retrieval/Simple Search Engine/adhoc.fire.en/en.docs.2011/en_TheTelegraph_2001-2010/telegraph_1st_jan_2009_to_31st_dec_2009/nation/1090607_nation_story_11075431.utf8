The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sangma stubs out return buzz
                                                                                                               Sangma stubs out return buzz
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Sangma: No mainstream                                  
	New Delhi, June 6: Purno A. Sangma today clarified that he had no plans to rejoin the Congress amid speculations that the Prime Minister has asked him to return to the parent party.         
	Sangma, a former Lok Sabha Speaker and now a senior NCP leader, also dismissed suggestions that his party would soon merge with the Congress, 10 years after it was formed as a breakaway over Sonia Gandhis foreign origin.         
	It (the NCP) has its own identity. Sharad Pawar is a leader in his own right. So where is the question of the NCP merging with the Congress? he asked. I am fully with Mr Sharad Pawar. He is my leader.         
	Yesterday, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh cordially asked Sangma when he planned to return to the mainstream  a comment interpreted by some as a nudge to the Meghalaya leader to rejoin the Congress.         
	Sangma, Tariq Anwar and Pawar were expelled from the Congress in 1999 after they raised the banner of revolt against Italy-born Sonias annointment as party chief.         
	They formed the NCP, which to this date officially claims in hoardings at party offices, and in party documents, that an Indian should lead India.         
	But within months of the formation of the NCP, it joined hands with the parent party in the Maharashtra government  though the two parties fought the 1999 Assembly polls separately.         
	The NCP and the Congress fought both the Maharashtra and Lok Sabha polls of 2004 together. They also contested the 2009 Lok Sabha polls together.         
	With Sonia clarifying repeatedly that she had no intentions of taking the countrys top job, the main argument behind the NCPs separate existence no longer exists.         
	Pawars deteriorating health and the Congresss resurgence in Maharashtra have triggered speculation in recent days of the NCP merging with the parent party.         
	Sangma, possibly the most vocal critic of Sonia among NCP leaders, however, flirted with the BJP just before the Lok Sabha polls, increasing tension with the Congress.         
	But earlier this week, he met Sonia along with his daughter Agatha  a minister of state in the Manmohan government  and apologised for his previous rants against her.

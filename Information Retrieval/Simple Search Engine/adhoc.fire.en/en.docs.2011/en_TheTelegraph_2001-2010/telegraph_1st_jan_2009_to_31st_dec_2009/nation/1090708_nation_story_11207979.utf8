The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Super-30 to get better
                                                                                                               Super-30 to get better
                              Grand plans                            
	New Delhi, July 7 (PTI): After achieving 100 per cent success for two consecutive years, the founder of the Super-30 wants the model to be replicated in other streams as well.        
	The Super-30 that begun seven years ago is a concept of coaching 30 students from economically weak backgrounds for the IIT selection process. It has produced over 100 IITians so far. Founder, mathematician Anand Kumar, wants his successful experiment to be replicated in other streams and says he is ready to help interested people in doing so. I believe such a model should be extended to prepare poor students for administrative services, mathematics and physics Olympiads and even for journalism, said Kumar while talking to the media.        
	I am ready to offer my help to people who are interested in taking up the model to other areas, he said.        
	In the past two years, the Super-30 has seen 100 per cent results with all its 30 students drawn from remote areas of Bihar and Jharkhand making it to the coveted Indian Institutes of Technology.         
	Kumar is also expanding his Super-30 net to states such as Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan and will triple the intake for his programme to induct 90 students for the batch that starts this year. We have ventured out of Bihar and Jharkhand to pick brilliant but underprivileged children from the Hindi-speaking belt, he said.        
	The Super-30 programme based in Patan, runs under the banner of Ramanujam School of Mathematics and provides free coaching, food and lodging to students for some months.        
	We have picked students who do not have the economic support and I am happy that we have sent them to the IITs, he said.        
	Kumar, who has published several research papers in mathematics, had failed to make it to the Cambridge University due to financial constraints. Despite an offer, I could not take admission. I am happy that I have enabled people from backgrounds similar to mine to reach Indias most coveted programme, he said.

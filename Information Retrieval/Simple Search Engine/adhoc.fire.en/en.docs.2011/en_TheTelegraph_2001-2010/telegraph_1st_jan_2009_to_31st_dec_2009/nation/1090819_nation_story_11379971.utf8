The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | If you want to give a tit-for-tat policy, call me to frisk Jolie
                                                                                                               If you want to give a tit-for-tat policy, call me to frisk Jolie
                                          
	What Shah Rukh Khan said on his return to Mumbai from the US         
	US SECURITY CHECKS        
	I am scared of the authorities and rules so I try to follow the rules of the country I travel to. Whenever I am in America, I have to report at least two hours in advance while travelling within the country for security reasons  they ask me to take off my clothes and shoes, and I do that. But I never experienced this kind of treatment.        
	There are some routine security measures  they check your fingerprints and scan your retina. But the routine security process was not followed. Instead, the authorities asked me bizarre and irrelevant questions. I am not trying to make a point here, but why were security measures not followed?                  
	The security of any country is important but caste, religion or race shouldnt come in the way of security measures. You may call me a mega star, a celebrity, but basically Im just a normal guy. But Im lucky that I have access to friends in the (Indian) consulate whom I could call up. But there are hundreds of others who dont have this facility.        
	If you want to give a tit-for-tat policy to American actors, then call me to frisk Angelina Jolie and Megan Fox whenever they are visiting India.        
	DETENTION        
	It was in Newark where I was detained for questioning. It was because they said my name was common to some name that popped up on the computer. I told them I am a movie star and had recently visited the country for the shooting for a film (My Name is Khan).        
	They kept on asking me silly questions like if I knew someone in the US who could vouch for me, if I could give them numbers of people they could get in touch with.        
	I had all the documents; they were asking me where I was going to be staying. I gave the name of Fox people, with whom I had finalised a deal a few days ago, as contacts. I kept on giving numbers. They wanted to know why I came here I felt bad, angry I was harassed for no reason.        
	I didnt say a word there because I have a sense of humour which might lead to something I dont want special treatment. I was not angry and I was not disturbed.        
	PUBLICITY                  
	I do not need any publicity. My films (My Name is Khan) release is seven-eight months away. Why should I do a publicity stunt now? When the time comes, I will create such a hoopla for the films publicity that the entire world will sit up and watch. Karan (Johar) is shivering because he has heard that the Americans and Fox studios to whom we have sold the film, would like to see the rushes of the film after all this.        
	I was asked bizarre questions by the airport officials. It wasnt a drama. I dont want publicity. But I feel routine procedure was not followed there. We should not be treated on the basis of our colour or nationality.        
	I hate people who rake up religious issues for their personal gains.        
	I dont want to sound pompous here but I dont need publicity to promote my movie. I am too big a star for that.        
	The films issue is much larger than just being a stop at the immigration. Its not ironic, maybe we made the film because one thinks this is an issue that should be addressed.        
	RETURNING TO US        
	I will go to the US when work demands but I will limit my travels. I have no complaints against the system but I wish it could be more streamlined and less cumbersome.        
	I am not going to the US in the near future. I will never go there with my family. I understand their security concerns but they must stop their paranoia. There should not be any security check on the basis of religion. I dont bother who says what. But I am a proud Muslim and a proud Indian too.        
	APOLOGY        
	I dont want an apology. They were doing their duty, and I had no objection to it. But they must improve the system and make people comfortable rather than making them feel embarrassed and insulted.        
	There were 20 other people in the same (detention) room. Was even their baggage missing? I was clearly told that my name flashed on their computer and therefore they had to question me.        
	When you have issued me a visa and imprints of my fingers and my photograph are on it, I am sure it is there in your system. Why do I have to go through the ordeal?        
	RAJIV SHUKLA        
	I managed to send SMSes to my family and friends from the detention room  Rajiv Shukla was one among them. He used his influence to reach the Indian embassy officials who came to vouch for me. But he also owns a news channel so the news went out to the world. That was not my intention.        
	They did not ask me not to use the mobile. It was written there on a poster so I did not call anyone  just texted Mr Shukla and my other contacts there, including Sant Chatwal (the hotelier).                  
	AMAR SINGH        
	Amar Singh is unwell, and I pray that he recovers soon with a healthy body and strong mind. (In response to Singhs comment that SRK was making a big deal of the incident while people like Amitabh Bachchan and many others, including former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, who have faced this have not created a mountain of a molehill).        
	MULAYAM SINGH        
	(On Mulayam Singhs accusation that SRK was doing all this for publicity) Yaar, yeh sab wahiyat batein hain (These are all idiotic statements). Let us not turn this into a political issue.                  
	SALMAN KHAN        
	(Reacting to fellow actor Salman Khans comments that such routine security check-up was okay) It is his experience and his point of view but it was not comfortable for me. I am a respectable man and I found all this offensive. This was a first for me. Maybe next time onwards, I will not mind as well.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 17: Tension ran high at Rajdhani College after students went on the rampage, protesting against the rejection of nomination papers by college authorities for the September 23 election.        
	Authorities rejected 16 of the 39 nominations, saying that the candidates did not have minimum college attendance, had failed to clear some papers and that some even had criminal records.        
	Nomination papers were filed in all colleges and universities yesterday. According to the Lyngdoh Committee guidelines, the papers were scrutinised on the basis of academic results, criminal antecedents, if any, attendance and whether candidates had contested college elections earlier, said election committee member Sadashiv Mahapatra.         
	Students of Rajdhani went berserk, vandalising the college building and damaging furniture soon after the final list came out this morning. At several places irate student groups burnt tyres, demanding reconsideration.         
	Finally, police were called in and they had to lathi-charge to control the students.        
	Similar unruly scenes were witnessed at Cuttacks Sailabala Womens College, where students squatted in front of the main gate protesting the rejection of nomination papers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Fish- amp;-flower barb versus piranha punch
                                                                                                               Fish- amp;-flower barb versus piranha punch
          OUR BUREAU                          Modi: Ocean fish				                                 
	Feb. 22: Flower or fish, Narendra Modi can make them stink equally.        
	For a moment, the Gujarat chief minister had almost sounded like an eager Congress loyalist, alluding to Rahul Gandhi as a flower grown in an orchard.        
	But no, it was a punch at the Amethi MPs privileged and sheltered upbringing  Modi was now describing him as an aquarium fish.        
	The Congress hit back at Modi, calling him a flesh-eating piranha.        
	We are the fish that swim in an ocean but we are not fish of aquarium, Modi said at a rally in Margao, Goa, as he attacked Rahul.        
	Fish of aquarium are being shown to you people. They dont have the strength to fight waves of the ocean, but we can fight it. We are not small fish floating in the comfort of aquariums but we weather huge storms to win, PTI quoted Modi as saying. He did not name Rahul, but it was clear who the target was.                  Rahul: Bred in a bowl?      
	If Rahul is like a fish in the aquarium, Congress spokesman Manish Tewari said in Delhi, then Modi is a piranha who devoured human beings. Piranhas, South American river fishes with sharp teeth, have a voracious appetite for meat.        
	Till recently, Modi largely ignored Rahul as if he was small fry. Analysts in Gujarat said Modi may have begun to see the Congress general secretary as a threat.        
	Rahul, during trips to Gujarat in the past few weeks, has recruited 7,000 for the Youth Congress from Surats recession-hit diamond hubs of Varachha, Kataragam and Karanj, which till recently did not have a single Congress worker.        
	On February 14, Rahul may have touched a particularly raw nerve when he criticised the chief minister for offering sops to the Nano project while doing nothing for the jobless diamond workers.        
	Modi hit back during his Surat trip yesterday, tying the Tata small-car project to Gujarats prestige. No one can puncture it, Modi said.        
	In Margao, he sneered at the prince. Flowers grown in an orchard may be beautiful but flowers growing on their own in the jungle have their own power and different fragrance. Friends, I am a flower grown in a jungle, PTI quoted Modi as saying.        
	Some people call themselves young. Arent there young people living in thehomes of the poor? But they are not considered young because their fathers are not rich, because their fathers were not Prime Ministers or their mothers big people.

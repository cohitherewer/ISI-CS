The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong refuses, miffed CM cancels lunch
                                                                                                               Cong refuses, miffed CM cancels lunch
          NALIN VERMA                               
	Patna, July 29: Nitish Kumar cancelled a lunch at his official residence today after Congress legislators refused to attend it on the plea that it was not the time to feast when people were reeling from a drought.         
	Earlier, the chief minister had invited legislators belonging to all political parties. Though Nitish described his invitation in keeping with the tradition of a feast, sceptics read politics behind the magnanimity.        
	A plethora of RJD and LJP leaders, including hardcore loyalists of Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan, joined Nitish Kumars JD(U) in the wake of the Bihars ruling partys grand show in the last Lok Sabha elections.        
	Many others in the parties that suffered a drubbing were said to the in the queue to join the JD(U) in the run-up to the by-elections to 18 Assembly seats in the near future and general elections due in 2010.        
	Understandably, the Opposition felt that the Nitish-sponsored lunch diplomacy was aimed at entering into the MLAs hearts through their stomachs. The Congress, by refusing to attend, may have received a vote of thanks from Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan. The party did state a valid political logic for its refusal. It is not morally right to attend a feast at the cost of public money when the states people are reeling under the impact of a drought and the possibility of starvation is staring at them, said BPCC president Anil Sharma justifying his decision.         
	Sharma added: There is no reason for Congress MLAs to join the CMs lunch as he (Nitish Kumar) has been accusing the Congress-led Centre of denying flood relief funds to the state.        
	The chief minister, the BPCC chief said: Is fooling the people. It is known to all that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh granted Rs 1,000 core to Bihar for flood-relief in 2008 and the chief minister has failed to furnish a utilisation certificate so far.        
	Congresss refusal may have been music to the ears of LJP president Ram Vilas Paswan whose party has been agitating against Nitish.        
	Besides trying to form a grand alliance of the RJD-LJP and the Congress against the JD(U)-BJP combination before the Assembly elections.         
	The chief minister today was visibly miffed. The MLAs should have kept the lunch free from politics. Bhoj ki parampara rahi hai, eska rajnitikaran nahin hona chahiye thaa (There has been a tradition of the feast. It should not have been politicised).

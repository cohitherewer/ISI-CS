          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bihar chief secretary Anup Mukherjee. (Deepak Kumar)                                  
	Patna, July 28: The Nitish Kumar government today appointed a new chief secretary following up a complete overhaul of the states bureaucracy and police administration, including a new DGP, Anand Shankar.         
	A 1974-batch IAS officer Anup Mukherjee has replaced R.J.M. Pillai, a 1973-batch IAS officer, as the chief secretary. Pillai is likely to go for voluntary retirement to become the chairman of the Bihar Public Service Commission. Mukherjee was the development commissioner before he took over as the states top bureaucrat.        
	Similarly, an IPS officer of the 1973 batch Anand Shankar will replace D.N. Gautam as the new DGP with Gautam retiring on July 31, 2009. Shankar, however, will have tenure of only seven months for he, too, will retire from service on February 28, 2010.         
	The government has executed the change at the top rung of the bureaucracy and the police set-up after getting new district magistrates in as many as 15 states districts and reshuffling 36 IPS officers from IG to SP ranks.        
	The incident in which a woman was stripped in full public glare on a Patna street and the subsequent outcry over the issue last week in the Assembly reportedly sparked the process of the bureaucracy and police administration overhaul.         
	Smarting under the attack from the national commission for women and the Opposition over the atrocity on women, the chief minister first went for a police set up change in Patna, replacing officers from IG to SP levels. Then, he virtually overhauled the police and the bureaucracy in Bihar.        
	Grapevine has it that by resorting to the overhaul, Nitish has tried to drive home the point that he was quite sensitive to the issue of law and order in the state and would go to any extent to ensure susashan (good governance).        
	Moreover, the government has chosen the best of the lot to head its police and bureaucratic set up. Both Mukherjee and Shankar are said to have an impeccable track record.        
	Nitish Kumars move is not wholly free from criticism.         
	As the Opposition has pointed out, Shankar has been the superintendent of police of only a single district in his career and has seldom been in the same range as IG and DIG.        
	As such, he is not endowed with much field experience required to control the crime in Bihar, the opposition say.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pak fire on Indian posts, soldier hurt 
                                                                                                               Pak fire on Indian posts, soldier hurt 
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Srinagar/New Delhi, March 21: A soldier was injured in firing on Indian Army posts from across the Line of Control last night, marking the first ceasefire violation in the Kashmir Valley this year.        
	At least two Indian posts in the Kamalkote area of the Uri sector were fired at between 10.10pm and 1.55am, a source in the Northern Command headquarters said over phone from Udhampur.        
	As far as we are concerned, we consider this a ceasefire violation because our posts were fired at, he said.        
	Some army sources said Pakistani troops fired between 1,500-2,000 rounds from small and automatic weapons, though others denied it. The firing was apparently so heavy it sparked panic in villages adjacent to the LoC.        
	The sources said there appeared to be no infiltration bid, which was unusual as such incidents generally provide covering fire to militants. But the Indian Army was now on alert for such violations ahead of the general election, they said.        
	Defence spokesperson Lt Col J.S. Brar said: We also retaliated to the firing, which continued till this morning. One jawan suffered minor splinter injuries in the incident.        
	The last ceasefire violation in the state took place on January 25 but that was in the Makwall-Chicken Neck area of the International Border in Jammu. Two BSF personnel were injured then.        
	In 2008, there were over 30 incidents of firing from across the LoC. Last nights firing came after a lull of nearly two months.        
	However, not all incidents of firing across the LoC are dubbed ceasefire violations. The Northern Command source said a flag meeting would be called soon.        
	The Muzaffarabad-Srinagar bus passes over the Aman Setu in the Uri sector but the firing was not near its route, the source said.        
	In Delhi, an army source said: We suspect pressure is building up in PoK because of the developments taking place in Pakistan. There are militants wanting to cross over to ease the pressure on the Pakistan Army so that they can show they remain committed to the Kashmir cause.        
	The firing in the Kamalkote area happened when the weather had taken a turn for the worse. On the nights of March 19 and 20, it had snowed in the upper reaches of the area, the Northern Command officer said.        
	Those who fired from the Pakistani side took cover of the darkness, he said. The posts fired at were in the frontline, between the anti-obstacle infiltration fence and the zero line of the LoC.        
	The officer said he would not term the incident anything more than a skirmish, but it was important to note it had taken place after a lull.         
	The ceasefire along the LoC has, by and large, held since 2003 before which heavy artillery firing was almost a daily affair in a situation best termed as no war, no peace.        
	Such fear haunts border villagers the most after every report of firing because they are afraid their daily lives will be rent asunder again by the boom-boom of guns.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Glare on J amp;K party 
                                                                                                               Glare on J amp;K party 
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                              
	Srinagar, July 18: The Omar Abdullah government has begun a probe into the alleged role of a mainstream political party in abetting violence in Kashmir.        
	It is being looked at by not one but two separate (government) agencies, Omar told The Telegraph over reports that the political party has allegedly distributed money to foment trouble.        
	Kashmir has seen widespread anti-government protests over the Shopian double murder and rape case and some other incidents after that, which has left five persons dead and hundreds injured in firing and teargas shelling by security forces.        
	Although the protests were spontaneous and a large number of people participated in them, the government believes the separatists and the mainstream party had a role in fomenting violence.        
	Omar said there was a convergence between separatists and the party, which had a common interest in keeping the pot boiling. Even the Union home minister (P. Chidambaram) has revealed that a lot of trouble is fomented by parties that have not accepted their defeat in the (Assembly) elections, Omar said.        
	The chief minister, however, refused to divulge details of the probe. It is not in my nature to make wild allegations or take action unless I back it with facts. Until I am able to conclusively present to you evidence about this, it will be wrong on my part to suggest anything more, other than the fact that note has been taken of it.        
	The Opposition parties scoffed at the probe, saying it was a witch-hunt by the National Conference government after the Shopian violence.        
	Nayeem Akhtar, the chief spokesperson of the Peoples Democratic Party, dared Omar to name the party. He can take us to court if he thinks it is us and if he has the evidence, Akhtar said.        
	Whatever be the case, he has made it abundantly clear that he is going after his political opponents since he has failed to take action in incidents like Shopian. It is obviously a witch-hunt, he said.

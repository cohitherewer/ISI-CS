                                                                                                               Students missing after poor results
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, Oct. 7: Apparently unable to cope with stress and possibility of parents being embarrassed at a parent-teacher meeting, two Class VIII students of Creane Memorial School have gone missing from home since Monday.        
	Gaurav and Aman were apparently afraid of being admonished by parents and teachers because of their poor English and mathematics scores in semester tests.        
	Sometime ago, a Class X student of the same school killed herself after being allegedly scolded by her mathematics teacher for scoring poorly in her paper.         
	The girl poured kerosene over her uniform before setting herself on fire.         
	According to Gaya superintendent of police (SP) Sushil Khopde, the parent-teacher meeting was scheduled for Tuesday.         
	The SP added that the school had the reputation of being strict with students and that both boys were spotted leaving school together on Monday.        
	When contacted, principal Father Raj said that the two were average and that the possibility of them being ashamed for having scored poorly was improbable.         
	He also blamed the girls death to an outcome of a love affair, rather than trouble at school.

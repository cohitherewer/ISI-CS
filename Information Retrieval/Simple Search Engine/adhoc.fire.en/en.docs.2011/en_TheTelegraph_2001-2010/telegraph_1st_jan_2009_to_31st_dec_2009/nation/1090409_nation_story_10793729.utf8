          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, April 8: Naxalites blew up a school-cum-cluster centre in Baluar village under Banke Bazaar police station area today, 4km from Raniganj village where Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar was scheduled to address a meeting in the afternoon.         
	The blast took place early in the morning.        
	This is the second blast within the past 72 hours. Earlier, Maoists blew up a school-cum-cluster centre in Barachatti police station area in a similar fashion.         
	According to reports, 100-odd rebels ransacked the two-storeyed building, took away the school computer and later blew the building and its adjoining resource centre using can bombs.         
	Confirming the incident, Gaya superintendent of police M.R. Naik said that a pattern was emerging as the past two blasts were timed to precede the chief ministers visit by a few hours.        
	The Naxalites have also stepped up their anti-election campaign with graffiti and posters.         
	The groups have also reportedly distributed printed material calling the election a sham and an eyewash.

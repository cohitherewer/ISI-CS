The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Brand Raman pulls BJP through
                                                                                                               Brand Raman pulls BJP through
          SHEENA K.                               
	Raipur, May 16: The Raman Singh factor favoured the BJP in Chhattisgarh, as the party swept the Lok Sabha elections by bagging 10 of the 11 seats.         
	Bucking the partys performance at the national level, the BJP delivered an outstanding performance in the state.         
	Chief minister Raman Singh had been the face of BJP in the November Assembly election and his clean image propelled the party to present Brand Raman in the state polls. The brand worked, and the party secured an absolute majority by bagging 50 seats in a House of 90.         
	In the Lok Sabha election, it was again the same brand that the BJP offered to the electorate in the state.         
	However, the question: Can he deliver this time? became a major poll plank in the Lok Sabha elections in the state. And Singh matched up to the expectations.         
	As the sweep for the BJP in the state came as a surprise, what was equally stunning was the results for many individuals.         
	Of them include former Prime Minister Atal Bihar Vajpayees niece Karuna Shukla, who lost the elections by a margin of about 21,000 votes to Congress Charandas Mahant in Korba Lok Sabha constituency. Korba is the only seat that BJP lost in the state of the 11.         
	In 2004 also, BJP had won 10 seats. But it later lost one to the Congress in the by-election in Rajnandgaon.         
	The other surprise came in from Bilaspur where BJP stalwart Dilip Singh Judeo trounced Renu Jogi  the wife of all-powerful Congress leader and former chief minister Ajit Jogi. Judeo won the seat by a margin of about 10,000 votes after facing a tough electoral battle.         
	The Maoist-hit pockets however continued to remain under the influence of saffron party. The BJP retained all the three Lok Sabha seats  Kanker, Bastar and Sarguja  that come under the Maoist-infested belt of the state.         
	In Sarguja, Muralilal of BJP won the election by a huge margin of 1,03,830 votes, while Baliram Kashyap and Sohan Potai retained Bastar and Kanker seats respectively by a comfortable margin.         
	BJP state president Vishnudeo Sai, who lost the Assembly elections from Pathalgaon in November 2008, retained the Raigarh Lok Sabha constituency by defeating his Congress rival Hridayram Rathia by a margin of about 50,000 votes.         
	Other candidates who would walk into the Lower House include Kamla Devi Patle (Janjgir-Champa), Madhusudan Yadav (Rajnandgaon), Saroj Pandey (Durg), Ramesh Bais (Raipur) and Chandulal Sahu (Mahasamund).         
	Despite a strong performance, the state headquarters wore a deserted look when it became clear that the NDA was nowhere near forming the next government in Delhi.         
	A pall of gloom descended upon the state BJP office where no celebration was held to mark the partys sweep in the Lok Sabha elections in the state.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Kerala Big Two test CPM truce
                                                                                                               Kerala Big Two test CPM truce
          JOHN MARY                               Vijayan, Achuthanandan				                                 
	Thiruvananthapuram, Feb. 15: Kerala chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan and state CPM boss Pinarayi Vijayan traded thinly veiled barbs today, less than 24 hours after the politburos balancing act intended at avoiding a showdown before the general election.        
	The fresh salvo in the long-running feud appeared to have been fired by Achuthanandan, who suggested that his refusal to toe the party line on backing Vijayan in a corruption case was consistent with his three-decade-old fight against dishonesty in public life.        
	You have seen my consistent fight against corruption for the past several decades the campaign that I initiated and I still carry on, Achuthanandan said at an interaction with journalists at Kerala House in Delhi this morning.        
	In a clever assertion that the CPM will find difficult to oppose in public, the chief minister recalled three big corruption cases in which he had taken leaders of the Congress-led United Democratic Front to court, and said his anti-corruption battles were far from over.        
	Achuthanandan, asked by the politburo yesterday not to speak publicly about the case, stayed within the line drawn by the party and did not name Vijayan who is an accused in a corruption case linked to power plants.        
	But the stress on fighting corruption  the veteran has a trademark style of delivery that stretches key words for emphasis  left little doubt that the real target was Vijayan, whose prosecution the state government will have to permit or refuse in three months.        
	 The request for trial has come from the CBI, which has accused Vijayan of wrongdoing in a 1996 deal with Canadas Lavalin as power minister.        
	From all this (past corruption cases), you know Ive been continuing this battle against corruption for decades and will continue to do so, the chief minister said.        
	Achuthanandan had yesterday met his politburo colleague and Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who knows a trick or two about managing the contradictions of running a government and abiding by the party line.        
	Hours after Achuthanandan spoke today, Vijayan hit back. The CPM state chief said anti-corruption campaigns Achuthanandan spoke of werent a solitary effort but party-initiated plans.         
	You seem to think its been a one-man campaign by VS (the initials by which Achuthanandan is known in Kerala) against corruption. All (previous) corruption cases taken up by him in courts were decided by the party and were part of its campaign. It is not a one-man show. VS is a product of the party, Vijayan told reporters in Kochi.        
	His comments echoed what the politburo told Achuthanandan yesterday: discharge your constitutional obligations as chief minister but dont stray from the party line.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Snake in House, MLAs day out 
                                                                                                               Snake in House, MLAs day out 
          SUBRAT DAS                          The search for the snake                                  
	Bhubaneswar, July 23: A hooded visitor to the Orissa Assembly armed with a deadly biological weapon today left the MLAs too panicky to transact any business.        
	None of the members saw the cobra but the news that one had been spotted in the House was enough. Adjournment after adjournment followed and then the days session was called off although hours of search failed to locate the intruder.        
	Sweeper Bhisma Nayak claimed to have seen the snake at 7am, over three hours before the House was to sit. I saw the two-and-a-half-foot, yellow snake near the Assembly secretarys chair when I came to sweep the House, he said.        
	He immediately called watchman Bholanath Behera. I lifted a stool and was about to throw it when I realised it was a cobra and stopped myself, Behera said. The cobra is feared and revered by many.        
	Forest officials and members of an NGO, Snake Helpline, were called in and, as they continued their search, the MLAs began arriving.        
	Speaker P.K. Amat announced an hours adjournment and kept extending it. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik asked members to vacate the House to allow a smooth search. Wildlife officials scoured the room with the help of sniffer dogs and hot-air blowers. We searched every corner but couldnt find the snake, range officer K.L. Purohit said.        
	But the House could not resume business amid the chaos and after two more adjournments, closed for the day at 3pm.        
	But politicians will be politicians. The appearance of the snake was a rumour, a ploy to avoid discussion on the home budget, Opposition Congress leader S.S. Saluja said.

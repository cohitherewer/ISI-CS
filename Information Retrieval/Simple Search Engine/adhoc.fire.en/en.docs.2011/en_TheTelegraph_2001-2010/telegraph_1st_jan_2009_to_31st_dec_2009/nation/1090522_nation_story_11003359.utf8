The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | SC comes to couple rescue
                                                                                                               SC comes to couple rescue
                            
	New Delhi, May 21 (PTI): The Supreme Court today restrained a girls family in Jammu and Kashmir from harassing her or her Muslim husband, saying any girl above 18 years was free to choose her life partner.        
	The couple, who appeared in the court with their baby daughter today, claimed they were being intimidated by the girls family with the support of Shiv Sena leaders.        
	The apex court asked Mehvesh Anjum, formerly Chanchili, about her age and marriage to Fiaz Ahmed Ahanger before directing Jammu and Kashmir police to provide protection to them if the couple so wanted.        
	The vacation bench, however, refused to stay an FIR lodged against the couple or the consequent police investigation against them.         
	A man named Darshan Singh had lodged the FIR at a Jammu police station claiming Chanchili was his wife and had been abducted by Fiaz.        
	Fiaz, a schoolteacher, had filed an appeal in the apex court after Jammu and Kashmir High Court dismissed his plea for a stay on the FIR.         
	The Supreme Court said India was a secular country and there could be no barriers to inter-caste and inter-community marriage as long as the girl was above 18 years.        
	If the parents do not approve (of) the inter-caste or inter-community marriage, the maximum they can do is sever their social relationship with the girl. But they (the family) cannot give her a thrashing, resort to violence or harass her, the court observed.

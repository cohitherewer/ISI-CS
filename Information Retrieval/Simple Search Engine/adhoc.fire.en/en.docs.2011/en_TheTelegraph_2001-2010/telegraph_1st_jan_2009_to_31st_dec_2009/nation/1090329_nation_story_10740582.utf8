The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Clean chit to Tytler
                                                                                                               Clean chit to Tytler
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                       Tytler: Perfect timing                          
	New Delhi, March 28: The CBI is believed to have given Congress leader Jagdish Tytler a clean chit in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, saving the party embarrassment before elections since it has already given him a ticket from Delhi.        
	Although the CBI is yet to make public the final investigation report it filed before a Delhi court today, sources said the agency had failed to find proof of the former ministers involvement in the riots. The court will take up the report on April 2.         
	The moment Congress gave Tytler a ticket for the general election, it was clear that the government would force the CBI to give him a clean chit, senior Supreme Court lawyer H.S. Phoolka, representing the riot victims, said.         
	The report is still sealed and in court and Tytler already knows that he has been cleared. The fact that the accused knows the outcome of the case before the proceedings are over, casts a shadow on the premier investigating agency of the country itself. We have witnesses who have named him. What more does the CBI need? he added.        
	Hundreds of Sikhs chanted Hang the culprits outside the court when the CBI filed its report in a sealed cover before metropolitan magistrate Ram Lal Meena.         
	The report was filed after the CBI examined Jasbir Singh, a California-based witness who in an affidavit told the Nanavati Commission inquiring into the riots that on November 3, 1984, he had overheard Tytler commenting on the killing of Sikhs in his constituency.         
	The case against Tytler relates to a mob attack on Gurdwara Pulbangash on November 1, 1984, killing three persons. In September 2007, the CBI had sought to close the case saying witness Jasbir was untraceable. But the court on December 19, 2007, asked it to file the investigation report after Jasbir came forward and offered to depose.         
	The Sikh community is upset with the Congress for giving tickets to Tytler and Sajjan Kumar, another riots accused, and riot victims have even submitted a memorandum to Sonia Gandhi.         
	Now that Sajjan Kumar has been given a ticket, the chargesheet against him will be further delayed by the CBI, Phoolka said.

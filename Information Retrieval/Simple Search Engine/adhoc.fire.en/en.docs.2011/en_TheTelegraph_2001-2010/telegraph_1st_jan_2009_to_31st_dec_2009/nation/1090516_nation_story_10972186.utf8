          CITHARA PAUL IN NEW DELHI                              
	When poll candidates lose badly, the Election Commission wins.        
	Hundreds of candidates lose their security deposit every election and the entire amount goes to the commission. So come May 16, the poll panel can expect to be richer by several crores.        
	Every candidate has to deposit a security at the time of filing nomination. The amount is Rs 10,000 for each Lok Sabha candidate, unless he or she is from the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes, in which case the deposit is Rs 5,000.        
	Defeated candidates who fail to secure at least a sixth of the total valid votes polled in their constituency forfeit their deposits.        
	Officials say the security deposits of defeated candidates have been a major source of revenue for the commission since the 1998 elections, when the security amount was hiked steeply.        
	The deposits that candidates forfeit are our only income apart from the annual budgetary allocation from the central government, a poll panel official said.        
	In 2004, 4,218 of the 5,435 candidates lost their deposits. Usually, baring the top two or three candidates in a constituency, the rest lose their deposits, the official said.        
	In 1999, 3,400 of the 4,648 candidates forfeited their deposit. So did 3,486 of the 4,750 candidates in 1998.        
	Till 1996, the deposit amount was just Rs 500, encouraging a large number of non-serious (Independent) candidates to contest, commission officials say. For instance, 13,592 people contested the 1996 elections, forcing the commission to print ballot papers in the form of booklets in certain constituencies.        
	The hike in amount slashed the number of candidates by nearly two-thirds in 1998. Encouraged by the result, the poll panel is planning to raise the amount further.        
	If that happens, it will be bad news for the Independents who face the highest risk of losing their money.        
	The law ministry has recommended that the security deposit be doubled progressively for every losing candidate who contests the next election. To make this happen, Parliament has to pass a law.        
	Such a measure can definitely expect support from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who has described Independents as spoilers and asked people not to vote for them.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Campus cops to prevent ragging
                                                                                                               Campus cops to prevent ragging
          MANJEET SEHGAL WARRIOR                               
	Shimla, May 21: Plainclothes police will be deployed in Himachal Pradeshs educational institutions, wracked by a spate in ragging over the past few months.        
	I have directed the law-enforcing agencies to deploy plainclothes policemen in educational institutions around the time of admission. Besides checking ragging, they will keep an eye on drug peddling and anti-social elements on campuses, chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal said today.        
	Although the chief ministers emphasis was on admission time, when freshers are often abused, officials later said the deployment could continue round the year in institutions deemed more vulnerable.        
	Probes into incidents of brutal ragging in the past two months, in professional colleges as well as schools, have linked the abuse to the increasing consumption of liquor and drugs on campuses.        
	First-year medical student Aman Satya Kachru, 19, died after being beaten, allegedly by drunken seniors, at a government college near Dharamsala in March.        
	The chief minister said one of the campus cops jobs would be to keep students away from such vices. Youths need to be protected against drug abuse. All suspicious people entering campuses need to be interrogated thoroughly and best academic conditions ensured, Dhumal said. He added there was a need for a campaign to sensitise students to the dangers of drug use.        
	Earlier this month, the government ordered an inquiry into a brutal attack on 11 students of Lawrence School in Sanawar by seniors. Last week, juniors at a homoeopathic college in Solan were thrashed, apparently because they did not greet their seniors.

                                                                                                               Hong Kong ship sinks
                            
	Mangalore, July 18 (PTI): A ship carrying iron ore to China today sank off the coast of Mangalore as efforts by the coast guard to arrest its drift failed and sparked fears of an oil spill from the vessel.         
	The Hong Kong-registered ship, Asian Forest, which tilted about 28 degrees near Tannirbavi, about six nautical miles from South of the Fairway Buoy of the New Mangalore port, went down because of turbulent weather conditions, sources said.        
	It has gone down. We are trying to get in touch with the ships owners and agents to prevent an oil spill, coast guard commandant Captain P.S. Jha said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	Patna, Aug. 19: Former railway ministers Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar criticised the students role in burning four AC coaches of Shramjeevi Express in Bihta after Mamata Banerjee apparently downplayed the incident saying: These things happen almost daily.        
	Passengers from outside the state travelling from Patna to Mokama to Lakhisarai in the east and from Patna to Buxar in the west shudder in fear because of lawless free trippers occupying the reserved bogies of long-distance trains passing through this stretch, Lalu Prasad said, demanding stern action against troublemakers.        
	Contrary to Mamatas virtual refusal to book the troublemakers captured on camera, Nitish said: The incident of torching the train is abominable. I have directed the police officers concerned to identify the culprits through the media clippings and bring them to justice.        
	According to sources in the railways, the burning of the trains four bogies and damaging other railway properties at Bihta yesterday caused a loss of Rs 3.5 crore.        
	There is no safety and security of the travellers on trains between Mokama and Buxar, Lalu Prasad said.

          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                                          Andhra MLAs at the meeting on Telangana with Union minister Jaipal Reddy in Delhi on Sunday. (PTI)      
	Hyderabad, Dec. 27: Students of Osmania University today announced they would henceforth spearhead the movement for a separate Telangana state, setting a deadline for January 2 for the Centre to initiate the process which New Delhi had promised earlier this month.        
	The student community has decided to take on the mantle of the Telangana movement from now onwards, said Bhaskar, a member of the universitys Joint Action Committee on Telangana.        
	The committee announced a programme called Vidyarthi Garjana (Roar of Students) on January 3 on the university campus when some five lakh students from 10 universities located in Telangana would congregate.        
	The university has been the nerve-centre of the movement since the seventies, but has seen the struggle come to naught because of political friction. The students are on an indefinite hunger strike on campus for the past six days.        
	This time, the students say, they will not allow political parties to hijack their movement. On Thursday, the students had vent their ire on legislators from the Telugu Desam, a party which has been sitting on the statehood fence, not willing to give a firm commitment of support.         
	The Desam today announced it would join the joint action committee of the Telangana Aikya Samiti, an umbrella organisation comprising the Telangana Rashtra Samiti, Congress, Praja Rajyam party, BJP and the CPI. The committee has given a bandh call in the Telangana region on December 30.        
	Desam members Nagam Janardhan Reddy, M. Narasimhmulu and Peddi Reddy attended the committees meeting at Hotel Golconda this evening along with the BJPs Ch. Vidyasagar Rao and the CPIs Narayana.        
	Nine Congress ministers from Telangana met over lunch at the residence of Union member S. Jaipal Reddy in Delhi. Late tonight, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee requested the ministers to withdraw their resignations.        
	Pranab Mukherjee asked us to withdraw our resignations and assured us there will be good news on the Telangana issue in the near future. We are also waiting for some special news on the issue, state minister Geeta Reddy said after the meeting.        
	President Pratibha Patil today cancelled her visit to Hyderabad though Rashtrapati Bhavan maintained it had been deferred because of official engagements in the national capital.

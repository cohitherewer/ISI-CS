  - Low-key New years Eve      ANANYA SENGUPTA                                    Supriya, Omar and Renuka: Politically correct?				                                       
	New Delhi, Dec. 31: Time to catch up with family and, of course, God.        
	Die-hard party animals might welcome the New Year on pulsating dance floors but Indias politically correct leaders have decided to tone down celebrations in these times of terror and shrinking treasuries.        
	Most have planned low-profile vacations with family. Goa seems to be the favoured destination, despite a government advisory against partying on its beaches.        
	Panchayati raj minister Mani Shankar Aiyar is already in this tourists paradise. So are aviation minister Praful Patel and minister of state for urban development Ajay Maken. Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar was due to reach today.        
	If Renuka Chowdhury had not changed her plans, she might have run into her colleagues, but the minister for women and child development has decided to visit Hyderabad with her family.        
	Kamal Nath has, however, stepped outside India. The commerce minister has gone to Southeast Asia.         
	Not all politicians will be away from home when 2009 dawns. Flush from victory in the Kashmir polls, Omar Abdullah has flown back to Srinagar. His brother-in-law, Congress leader Sachin Pilot, is scheduled to visit him and the two are planning to ring in the New Year together.        
	Pawars daughter Supriya Sule, too, will celebrate New Years Eve with her family. I have been wishing everyone a safer 2009 and praying for the global economic situation to improve, she said.        
	Our party leaders are not party-hopping at five-star hotels this year. Given the situation in the country, no politician can afford to be caught partying, said a Congress leader.        
	Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit will stay put in the capital. So will Manmohan Singh. Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, known to head for the hills around this time of the year, has decided against going on a trip. The weather change last year had taken a toll on her health.        
	If its family time for many, some have decided to appease the gods.        
	Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal plans to visit the Golden Temple. Delhi transport minister Arvinder Singh Lovely, too, plans a soul cleansing trip to Amritsar.         
	Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan is in Shirdi.        
	Others will say it with blankets or salt.        
	Newly crowned chief minister Ashok Gehlot said he would distribute blankets to Rajasthans poor.        
	Chhattisgarhs Raman Singh, who retained power, probably wants to rub it in. He said he would spend New Year night with family and hold a meeting tomorrow on distribution of free salt among the poor and rice at Rs 2 a kg.        
	Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi is, however, planning a soldierly celebration. He is spending his first day of the year with soldiers guarding the Rann of Kutch at the India-Pakistan border.                    WITH INPUTS FROM RASHEED KIDWAI AND SATISH NANDGAONKAR

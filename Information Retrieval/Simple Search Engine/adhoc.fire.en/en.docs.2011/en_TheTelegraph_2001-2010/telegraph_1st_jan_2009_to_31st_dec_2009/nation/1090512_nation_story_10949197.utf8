The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Message to Patil, not to Punjab
                                                                                                               Message to Patil, not to Punjab
          SANJAY K. JHA                          Advani: Show of unity                                  
	New Delhi, May 11: Yesterdays NDA show of strength in Ludhiana was meant more for President Pratibha Patil than the voters of the lone remaining phase of the election.        
	The BJP, fearful of being outsmarted in the post-poll numbers game, wants the largest pre-poll grouping to be invited first to form the government. The Ludhiana rally, which L.K. Advani made a point of terming the alliances largest gathering in its history, was meant to contrast this pre-poll NDA unity with the divisions in the UPA.        
	UPA partners Rashtriya Janata Dal, Lok Janshakti Party and Samajwadi Party are now contesting against the Congress. The BJP, though, fears tactical ploys after May 16 to present a regrouped UPA as the larger bloc.        
	BJP leaders said that, for instance, a pliant President might choose to invite the largest single party if the Congress notches the highest tally, and ask it to get letters of support from other parties.        
	The BJP fears that once invited by Patil, the Congress may be in a better position to show a majority with the help of its estranged allies and the Left. Therefore, the BJP wants to insist that the President invite the largest pre-poll grouping.        
	A senior BJP leader acknowledged that the main objective of the Ludhiana rally was to send a message to Patil.        
	Four phases have already taken place; the rally was not held just for the Punjab elections (on May 13). Had it been for votes, it would have been held much earlier, he said.        
	Advani had proposed such a rally be held before the polls or just after the first phase, but it could not happen because Nitish Kumar refused to share the dais with Narendra Modi till the elections were over in Bihar, top NDA sources said.         
	The rally was shelved since Nitishs absence would have signalled cracks in the alliance. It was later revived to underline that the NDA was the largest pre-poll grouping. The BJP plans a campaign blitz to showcase NDA unity in the next few days.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 14: The resurgence of Japanese encephalitis leading to the death of over 500 children this year in eastern Uttar Pradesh has embarrassed the Centre into announcing a set of measures that implicitly acknowledge its failure.        
	The government will set up a research team under the Indian Council of Medical Research to study in greater detail the virus, junior health minister Dinesh Trivedi told the Lok Sabha today.         
	The health ministry will also set up a department of physical and mental rehabilitation at the BRD medical college in Gorakhpur, the town worst affected by the virus that leaves several victims invalids for life, Trivedi said.        
	The ministry will also launch an awareness campaign on the disease in eastern Uttar Pradesh  where the disease has killed and maimed children for 31 years.         
	I myself was extremely shocked while researching for this reply. This is not a situation which can be allowed to continue, Trivedi said. He was responding to a calling-attention motion by the Gorakhpur MP, the BJPs Yogi Adityanath.         
	 The recurrence of the disease has raised questions on the Centres claim in 2006 that it had immunised almost all children under 15 for the virus.

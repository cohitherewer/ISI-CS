          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 30: If you have it, flaunt it.         
	A contest called Shreshtha Odiyani or the best Oriya woman will be organised by Sambhabana, a cultural organisation, in a bid to instil a sense of belonging into their culture on the eve of Oriya New Year.         
	Odiya Mahotsav  a festival celebrating the states culture, will follow this programme.        
	The Odiyani festival would include a seven-series competition involving tests of culinary skills, especially involving Oriya cakes, alpana drawing competition, paan-making meets, conch-blowing and Purana recitation competitions. The Odiyani contest will be open to married women above the age of 25.        
	The younger generation is losing interest in their culture. These festivals are our endeavour to imbibe a love for tradition and celebrate being Oriya, said an organiser of Sambhabana, which also brings out an Oriya magazine.         
	Organiser Sarat Chandra Bhadra said: Every state needs to conserve, promote and highlight regional traditions. The youth participating in the festival have to be in the age group of five to 25. The event will have an Oriya competition, and quizzes on the states heritage and culture. The group has also been celebrating birth anniversaries of personalities. The organisers have already received thousands of applicantions.         
	Registration is on and we are expecting a huge turn out, said Parija. The festival will also feature traditional dance and music troupes.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT      
	Raipur, June 21: Police today said that their haste to reach the CRPF camp by nightfall may have cost jawans their lives in Dantewada yesterday.        
	The toll in the Maoist mini-truck blast increased to 12 today with one more jawan succumbing to his injuries.         
	The police believe that jawans of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and accompanying personnel drove into the rebel trap while trying to get out of the forests before it got too late.         
	Guerrillas on Saturday blew up a mini-truck carrying CRPF personnel near Kokanara in Dantewada.         
	The incident took place around 6pm, while a line of security vehicles, including jeeps and a mini-truck, were passing through the forests.         
	Police sources said that seven rebels were killed in a gun battle that followed the blast. The rebels bodies have been recovered from the spot.        
	Though the incident occurred early in the evening, reinforcement could reach the blast site only after midnight.        
	Early today the state headquarters received a clearer picture of the encounter.        
	Bastar inspector-general T.J. Langkumer said seven, and not five jawans, died on the spot, while five succumbed to injuries in hospital.         
	About 11 jawans were injured in the incident.        
	Langkumer said that the rebels indiscriminately fired on the security personnel soon after the blast.         
	Those jawans travelling in jeeps who had moved ahead came back to the spot and retaliated, killing seven on the spot.         
	Meanwhile, police believe that haste of CRPF jawans to come out of forests before it got too dark may have cost them their lives.         
	Some 40 jawans and policemen had travelled to Tongpal village on Saturday afternoon after rebels torched vehicles belonging to a construction company.         
	Some jawans decided to board the jeep as it was getting too dark and walking was slowing the group down. They wished to get out of the forests, said a senior police officer to The Telegraph.         
	The rebels were reportedly waiting for the jawans to board the vehicle and they blew it up right after.         
	Sources said the explosion was so intense that the vehicle was tossed several feet and crushed at least four jawans to death as it landed. Others died due to the impact of the blast and from bullet injuries.

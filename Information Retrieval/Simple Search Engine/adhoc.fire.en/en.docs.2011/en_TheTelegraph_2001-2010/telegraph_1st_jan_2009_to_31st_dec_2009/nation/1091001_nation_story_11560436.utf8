          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        Rukhsana      
	Srinagar, Sept. 30: The Jammu and Kashmir government has decided to shift Rukhsana and her family amid fears that militants might target the Rajouri girl who shot a top Lashkar rebel after he had broken into their home.        
	Rajouri police chief Shafaqat Watali said: We wanted to either provide them a safe house in Thanamandi, the town closest to their village, or shift them to Rajouri. They were keen to explore the latter option as they think they will be safe there, he said, adding that the police had already started hunting for a safe house in Rajouri.        
	Rukhsana, 21, and her teenaged brother Aijaz fought and killed Abu Osama with his own gun as he and another militant roughed up their parents on Sunday suspecting them to be police informers.

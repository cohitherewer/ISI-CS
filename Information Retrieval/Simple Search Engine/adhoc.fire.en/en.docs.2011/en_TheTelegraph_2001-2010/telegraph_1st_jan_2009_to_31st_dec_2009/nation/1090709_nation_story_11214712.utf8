          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                          Mayavati: Controversy cap                                  
	New Delhi, July 8: An ecological park, not Mayavatis statues, will adorn the land being vacated by an overcrowded jail in Lucknow, the Uttar Pradesh government told the Supreme Court today in an attempt to cap a monumental controversy in the state.        
	The Mayavati government, under fire for an alleged drive to erect the chief ministers statues in the state capital, painted such a pretty picture of the new jail that the chief justice could not resist an aside. Now everyone will want to go to jail, Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan said as the states counsel listed a raft of facilities being lined up in the new prison.        
	The court lifted the stay on construction on the land after the Uttar Pradesh government declared that an ecological park would be built on the 195 acres that would be freed once the jail is shifted to the outskirts of Lucknow.         
	The high court in Lucknow had stopped demolition on the old jail premises after a lawyer filed a petition alleging the prized stretch in the heart of the city would be used to put up statues of Mayavati and her mentor Kanshi Ram. The court had also halted the transfer of inmates to the new complex, asking the state to ensure that no tree on the old premises was cut.        
	The state government assured the Supreme Court today that the ecological park would be developed in the old jail complex. The government said the swanky jail had been built with Rs 210 crore to ease overcrowding in the old prison. The old facility has a capacity to house 2,010 inmates, but was collapsing under the weight of 3,632 inmates, the state said.         
	The process of shifting inmates had begun in 1995 and should be allowed to be completed, the state said. The new jail will have video-conferencing facility to permit prisoners to depose without moving out, a sewage system, a water treatment plant and a rainwater harvesting system. It will house 4,660 inmates at any point.        
	At this juncture, the chief justice displayed his sense of courtroom humour.

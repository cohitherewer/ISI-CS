The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Basu return gift for Pranab
                                                                                                               Basu return gift for Pranab
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Basu (top), Mukherjee: Thanksgiving				                                 
	New Delhi, July 8: When Pranab Mukherjee greeted Jyoti Basu on his 95th birthday, the CPM patriarch wished him back.        
	It is not that the finance minister shares his birthday with the veteran communist. It was his return gift for giving the country a good budget.        
	As Mukherjee blushed and a string of dhonnobaads (thank you) rolled off the telephone receiver, it was clear that this was one approbation he would store in his memory forever.        
	Speaking to Basu in the presence of a few journalists seated in his parliamentary chamber, Mukherjee had wished him a long life and advised him to take it easy. Basu, perhaps, mentioned the budget to which the minister said he was glad he had heard it.        
	Mukherjee spoke of how alert Basu was. He then reminisced about budget presentations since Independence and ticked off a journalist for tripping up on facts.         
	The journalist, who insisted that John Mathai was independent Indias first finance minister, was told it was R.K. Shanmugham Chetty and that Mathai was the second.        
	The Congress, that describes Mukherjee as a walking and talking compendium of its history, would have to amend its perception.        
	When he reeled off the names of his predecessors, including those from the non-Congress Janata Party (Morarji Desai), Bharatiya Lok Dal (Charan Singh), Samajwadi Janata Party (Yashwant Sinha), United Front (P. Chidambaram) and the BJP (Sinha and Jaswant Singh), he mentioned the years they unrolled their budgets, full-fledged and interim, the number of times each had the privilege of doing so and who had quit mid-term. He didnt say why.        
	The nuggets that came with the facts showed Mukherjees heart lay in the finance ministry. He recalled that until 1985, when V.P. Singh became finance minister, a rule set by the British was scrupulously followed.        
	The rule was no finance minister would inscribe his name either on the official letterhead or the budget papers. The reason? Every citizen of this country is expected to know who his Prime Minister and finance minister are. There was no need to write the names, Mukherjee said.        
	Manmohan Singh, however, did away with the enforced anonymity.        
	Although Mukherjee wanted to restore the rule, Doctor Saheb, as he addresses Singh, advised him to let things remain the way they were.        
	Mukherjee wasnt the only politician to greet Basu today. Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee did, too. She nearly forgot the occasion until a TV reporter reminded her.         
	Mamata quickly asked Partha Chatterjee, the leader of the Opposition in the Bengal Assembly who was by her side in Parliament, to arrange for flowers to be sent and the phone to be connected to Basu.

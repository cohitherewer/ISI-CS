  - Constable accused of writing anonymous letter hinting at familys involvement        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A man helps another as a house burns in Srinagar on Tuesday. Residents said the fire was caused after a tear gas shell fired by police landed in the building. The police were attempting to disperse protesters demonstrating against the CBI report. The police denied the charge and described the fire as an accident. (Reuters)                                        
	Srinagar, Dec. 15: As if the chargesheet wasnt explosive enough, a letter bomb has burst into the open.        
	A Kashmir police constable has been accused of trying to mislead the probe into the alleged Shopian rape and murder case by hinting in an anonymous letter at the involvement of the family of the two victims.        
	CBI sources said investigations found the constable wrote the letter asking police to probe the role of the family of Neelofar, 22, and her sister-in-law Asiya, 17, for the alleged May 29 murders that had triggered violent protests by residents who blamed security forces.         
	The revelation came along with the report the CBI submitted to the high court yesterday which claimed Neelofar and Asiya were not murdered but had drowned in a stream in their town Shopian, 50km from Srinagar.        
	The 66-page chargesheet-cum-report indicted 13 persons  among them doctors, lawyers and civilians  for fabricating evidence to prove that the two women were raped before being killed.         
	Five police officers, including then Shopian police chief Javed Iqbal, who were earlier arrested for destroying evidence, were exonerated. The report sent ripples of anger across the Valley, with residents alleging a clear cover-up.        
	A CBI officer said the letter was written by constable Mohd Yaseen Ganie to divert the probe.        
	The constable has been prosecuted under sections 203 and 211 of the Rambir Penal Code (the states equivalent of the Indian Penal Code), which are non-cognisable (less serious), the officer added.        
	The officer said the letter was supposedly written by a classmate of Asiya claiming that he was in love with her and that her family eliminated the girl as they disapproved of the relationship.        
	The writer, who asked the police to investigate the familys role in the alleged murders, claimed that he met Asiya and Neelofar on May 29 at a nearby orchard.        
	We were spotted by Shakeel (Asiyas brother), prompting the two women to run away from the area, the letter said.        
	Sources said the local police station received the letter after the 47-day protests, which erupted in the town after the bodies of Asiya and Neelofar were fished out of the stream, had ended.        
	Now that it has been established that they were not murdered, how can the family be involved in it, the CBI officer said.        
	The CBI complaint said the letter was meant to mislead/divert the investigation        
	The handwriting expert of the Forensic Science Laboratory Srinagar has attributed the authorship of this letter to Constable Mohd Yaseen Ganie No. 538/SPN, who had written the said letter to mislead/divert the investigation from its logical conclusion, the CBI said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cleric bar on conversion for polygamy
                                                                                                               Cleric bar on conversion for polygamy
          CITHARA PAUL                            Chand, Fiza                                 
	New Delhi, Feb. 21: Several Muslim religious authorities have decided to instruct muftis not to sanctify any marriage involving recent converts to try and stop cynical conversions to Islam for polygamy.        
	The move comes after the high-profile elopement and marriage of then Haryana deputy chief minister Chander Mohan and bureaucrat Anuradha Bali  who became Chand Mohammed and Fiza because Mohan already had a wife  and their subsequent break-up.        
	Conversion to Islam just to get married for a second time is nothing but sacrilege and will not be tolerated. These weddings of convenience will not be allowed any more, Moulana Mufti Ehsan Hasmi of the influential seminary, Darul Uloom Deoband, said.        
	Adopting Islam with the intention to have a second wife is un-Islamic and unjustifiable, said Qari Usman, Darul rector.        
	However, some religious heads were sceptical about the call for a blanket ban on marriages involving recent converts. How will we distinguish between a genuine convert who wants to get married according to Islamic laws and a fake one? So this stricture is not going to work, Ali Hyder of the Imam Sangh said.        
	According to Islam, changing ones faith for any reason other than love for God and his Prophet is illegitimate. However, many imams, muftis and qazis never question or probe the would-be converts intentions, sources in the All India Muslim Personal Law Board said. They added that they knew of instances of converts bribing the local imams and muftis not to raise questions.        
	The Deoband seminary had supported Chand in December when he announced his conversion and his marriage to state law officer Anuradha Bali. Its fatwa department, however, has now issued strictures against the couple saying their conversions were childish, rector Usman said.        
	Moulana Habib-ur Rahman, imam of Jama Masjid, Punjab, too has issued a fatwa saying the marriage is not acceptable.        
	He has used Islam for the sake of marriage. There is no room for exploiters in Islam, he said, adding that a criminal case should be registered against the couple.        
	The drama-a-day Chand-Fiza scandal, which cost both of them their jobs, may have brought the issue under the spotlight but there have been scores of instances of conversion for polygamy over the years, even among celebrities like actors and singers. The law allows only Muslim men to have more than one wife.        
	Bollywood stars Dharmendra and Hema Malini had allegedly converted in 1979 and married as Dilawar Khan and Ayesha after the action heros first wife Prakash had refused to divorce him.                     WITH INPUTS FROM RASHEED KIDWAI

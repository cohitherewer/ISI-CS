	Patna, Aug. 11: Two cubs have been sighted in Valmiki Tiger Reserve on the Indo-Nepal border to the delight of big cat lovers at a time when its population is declining fast.        
	In what looks like a ray of hope, the cubs, along with their mother, have been sighted ahead of the World Tigers Summit next year in Ranthambhore where experts from across the globe will deliberate on the conservation of the endangered cats.        
	According to forest department officials, Border Security Force jawans and villagers saw the two cubs and their mother in the Manpur area on the eastern end of the Valmiki Tiger Reserve spread over 510sqkm in West Champaran district.        
	In fact, the tiger reserve has been witnessing tigers on regular intervals while most such national parks wait for years to record a sighting.        
	The forest officials had sighted two other cubs with their mother in 2005. Two more cubs were born to the same tigress in 2007, which were last sighted and filmed last year. Two more cubs were sighted on August 1 and August 4 in the reserve with a new mother.        
	Junaid, the tiger taker of the forest since 1992, recalled how the tigers demonstrated their presence in the reserve in 2005 by devouring two cows, which had strayed into the forest area in its western region.         
	Junaid, who was also there with the BSF jawans on August 4, said: The cubs were playing their mother who was quietly roaming around in the bushes in the eastern area of the forest.        
	The sight of two cubs indicates a safe habitat for the tigers in Valmiki for, according to experts, the tigress do not conceive even after mating if they do not find habitat to deliver.         
	Forest department officials said that the tiger population was on the rise in Valmiki Tiger Reserve, as in 2005 the tiger population had grown to 36 from 22.         
	Certainly, the reserve has over 40 tigers now, though no survey has taken place since 2005, Junaid said.

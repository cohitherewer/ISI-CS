The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bihars prestige seat goes to poll
                                                                                                               Bihars prestige seat goes to poll
          NALIN VERMA                          Ram Vilas Paswan campaigns in Fatuha. (PTI)                                  
	Patna, May 27: Actor-cum-BJP leader Shatrughan Sinha was trailing by 14,000 votes in Fatuha Assembly segment of Patna Saheb Lok Sabha seat, when his lead in the rest of the five segments pulled him through and gave him an impressive margin of 1.5 lakh votes.        
	It is this Fatuha Assembly constituency with that will go to by-poll tomorrow after the seat fell vacant recently after the demise of its JD(U) MLA Saryug Paswan.        
	Now, prestige of three parties  JD(U), RJD and LJP  and its heroes Nitish Kumar, Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan is at stake from this seat.         
	While the JD(U) and Nitish Kumar scored an impressive win in the recently concluded Lok Sabha polls, Paswans LJP drew a blank.        
	The party has fielded Punit Rai as a nominee from the Fatuha seat in alliance with the RJD. Congress has fielded nominee Dwarika Paswan in Fatuha, while JD(U) has fielded Arun Majhi.         
	Both Paswan and Lalu together addressed more than 15 meetings in the constituency and reached out to the remotest villages to wrest the seat from the JD(U), which had fielded Saryug Paswan.        
	What led Lalu-Paswan combination to smell blood here is the fact that Shatrughan Sinha  a JD(U)-BJP nominee on Patna Saheb seat  trailed badly in Fatuha despite winning Patna Saheb.        
	A RJD-LJP win from this seat would be a relief for both Lalu and Paswan. Lalu Prasad chose Fatuha to announce his resolve to hit the streets and stay with the people in the run-up to the Assembly elections, due next year in Bihar.         
	I do not mind if I do not get a central ministry. In fact our defeat has given us (RJD-LJP) an opportunity to spend time with our people. I am sure that the combination will ensure a positive result in Assembly election, said Lalu Prasad.        
	Nitish Kumar who spearheaded NDAs grand show at the Lok Sabha polls, is also aware of Fatuhas significance. Thus, he too, matched Lalu-Paswans campaigns by addressing a series of meetings there.        
	The state will witness a mini-election of sorts for 17 of its 240 Assembly seats that fell vacant in the wake of their MLAs resigning and opting for Lok Sabha polls. The by-election, the dates for which the Election Commission will notify in future, is likely to determine if the JD(U)-BJP combination will carry on with its winning streak or if the RJD-LJP combination will retain lost ground.        
	The JD(U)-BJP had 14 of its representatives in the Assembly against three of the RJD, before the MLAs jumped on to the Lok Sabha bandwagon. If the RJD-LJP combination takes it tally substantially beyond three seats, Lalu Prasad and company will apparently take it as a boost ahead of next years general elections.        
	If the JD(U)-BJP combination maintains its hold over 14 seats, Nitish Kumar will see a chance to retain power and continue in the states hot seat.

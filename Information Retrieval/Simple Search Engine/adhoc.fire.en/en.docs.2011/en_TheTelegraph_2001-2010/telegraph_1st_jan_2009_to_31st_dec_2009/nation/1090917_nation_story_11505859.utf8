The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Parliament to get disabled-friendly
                                                                                                               Parliament to get disabled-friendly
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	New Delhi, Sept. 14: Parliament House will soon become more accessible to physically challenged visitors, with plans to install braille signposts, ramps, railings, lifts and accessible toilets.        
	We are trying our best to make this possible by the winter session, which is expected to start this November, a Parliament secretariat official said.        
	The entire premises will have signposts to help visitors who are physically challenged, with employees at hand to guide the visually impaired to the braille signposts. There will be a reserved parking and drop-off area for the vehicles of people with disabilities.        
	We are also planning to install an information board, carrying the details of all the special facilities, at the entrance, the secretariat official said.        
	Javed Abidi, a disabled-rights activist, said turning Parliament disabled-friendly would have a far-reaching effect.        
	Parliament is a heritage site for all Indians, and once it becomes a disabled-friendly zone, we can hope that the rest of the buildings and public spaces in India will turn accessible to the disabled, he said.        
	The Parliament secretariat has also decided to buy goods and items as much as possible from co-operatives and NGOs that work for people with disabilities.        
	All major countries  including the US, the UK, France and Germany  have made their Parliaments disabled-friendly, and Sri Lanka is in the process of doing that.         
	Disabled-rights groups had been demanding this in India and had handed a detailed plan to the President on how to make Parliament accessible to the physically challenged.        
	Abidi had played a key role in getting the Election Commission to arrange rails, wheelchairs, etc, at polling booths for people with disabilities, a move that turned the last Lok Sabha polls into Indias first disabled-friendly election.        
	All the major political parties too had mentioned the disabled in their manifestos. The Congress, the BJP and the CPM had promised to make public places fully accessible to people with disabilities, introduce reservation for them in public-sector jobs and education, and give them priority in poverty alleviation programmes.        
	India is home to 6 crore people with disabilities. Of them, 48 per cent are visually challenged, 28 per cent are movement impaired, 14 per cent are mentally disabled and 10 per cent are hearing and speech impaired.

	Calcutta, Feb. 5: Around100 Youth Congress activists today demonstrated at the party headquarters in front of Rahul Gandhis emissary, urging the leadership not to surrender the party at Mamata Banerjees feet.        
	The protesters at Bidhan Bhavan shouted slogans against an alliance with the Trinamul Congress ahead of the Lok Sabha polls as All India Youth Congress general secretary Nadim Yadav looked on.         
	Sources said the demonstration was engineered by supporters of Congress MLA Deepa Das Munshi, whose differences with Mamata are well known.         
	Deepa last week held a rally in south Calcutta, the Trinamul leaders turf, and said the party should not surrender the organisation at Mamatas feet for the alliance.

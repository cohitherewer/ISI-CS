                                                                                                               Bill to settle judges asset row
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 8: The government is working on a new bill that will settle all issues of judicial accountability including the contentious subject of judges assets declarations, law minister M. Veerappa Moily said today.        
	It will be introduced in the winter session of Parliament once the cabinet clears it, he said.        
	The new bill will provide a formal structure within which judges would reveal their assets details, which would be made available to the public with adequate safeguards. It will also lay down procedures of dealing with complaints against judges and holding inquiries against them.        
	Currently, complaints against judges are looked into by a peer group (collegium) under an informal arrangement in the absence of formally laid down procedures. If the complaints are found true, the collegium can only recommend the judges impeachment by Parliament  the only way a judge can now be punished.        
	Impeachment is a long-drawn process since it involves building a political consensus. As a result, no judge has ever been impeached in India. The government now intends to empower the Chief Justice of India (CJI) to take various other disciplinary actions against errant judges.        
	Moily said the government had decided to bring in a new law instead of making more amendments to the original Judges Inquiry Bill, 1968. Earlier, the Centre had been forced to withdraw the Judges (Declaration of Assets and Liabilities) Bill in August 2009 after the Opposition slammed it over a clause that placed information on judges assets beyond the right to information (RTI) law.        
	Under the present system, Supreme Court judges reveal their assets to the CJI, and high court judges to their respective chief justices.

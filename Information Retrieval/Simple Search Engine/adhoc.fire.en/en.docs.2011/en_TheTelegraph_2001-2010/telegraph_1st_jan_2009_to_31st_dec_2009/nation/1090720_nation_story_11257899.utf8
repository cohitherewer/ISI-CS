The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | NDA wins majority, but BJP loses
                                                                                                               NDA wins majority, but BJP loses
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, July 19: For the first time since 2005, when Nitish Kumar became the chief minister of Bihar, the NDA secured a majority in the legislative council on July 13.        
	Though BJP-JD(U) together won 14 of the 24 seats, grabbing 48 seats in the 75-member upper House, BJP could stand to lose this time, as the JD(U), with 30 members in the upper House, may put a question mark on BJPs claim to the post of the councils chairman. As of now the council has Arun Kumar (Congress) as its chairperson. Kumar is about to complete his term. Prior to the council polls, BJP veteran and senior Patna high court lawyer Tarakant Jha was eyeing the position.         
	The BJP, too, was favouring the veteran for the prestigious post based on the logic that the states chief minister and the Speaker were both from the JD(U). According to coalition dharma, the BJP ideally should have got the chairmans post.         
	But, with the JD(U) getting 30 of the seats on its own and enjoying the support of four Independent members, it has gained absolute majority. Given the image of chief minister Nitish Kumar as a dispassionate bargainer, the JD(U) is unlikely to concede the coveted post to its ally.         
	BJP general secretary Arun Jaitely is in the Bihar capital today to attend a seminar on the Union budget-2009. He is likely to meet the chief minister and raise the issue of the partys claim to the council post. But, the state BJP leaders are least hopeful of Nitish Kumar conceding any ground to Jaitely, particularly after gaining the security of a near majority for his party.         
	The upper House has three vacancies caused by the resignation of RJDs Bhim Singh, who joined the JD(U), and JD(U)s Nagmani and Rambadan Rai who contested the polls on RJD symbols.         
	After drawing a blank in the past Lok Sabha election, Ram Vilas Paswans LJP received some solace in the council poll as the party won three seats to the upper House in which it had lost its existence after Sanjay Singh crossed over to the JD(U) recently.

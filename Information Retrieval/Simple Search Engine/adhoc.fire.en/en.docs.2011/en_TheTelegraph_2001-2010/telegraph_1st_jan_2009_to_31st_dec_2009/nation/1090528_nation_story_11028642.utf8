	Raipur, May 27 (PTI): The Chhattisgarh government has banned the sale of Tamiflu, the anti-viral drug used to treat swine flu, at medicine shops to prevent indiscriminate use of the medicine.        
	The government has banned the sale of Tamiflu, the only available drug to treat swine and bird flu viruses H1N1, H5N1. Henceforth, the drug  Oseltamiver Phosphate (Tamiflu)  will be distributed only by the health department, said health minister Amar Agrawal today.        
	Agrawal said the step was taken to contain indiscriminate use of the medicine that might result in making the virus drug-resistant.        
	Health and family welfare department director B.S. Sarwa said the anti-viral drug is available in adequate quantity in the state. As and when needed, more stock can be sought from the Centre, he added.

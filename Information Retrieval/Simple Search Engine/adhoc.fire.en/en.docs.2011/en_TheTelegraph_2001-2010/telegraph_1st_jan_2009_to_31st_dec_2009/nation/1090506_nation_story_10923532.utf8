The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rajasthan royals on a roll
                                                                                                               Rajasthan royals on a roll
          RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR IN JAIPUR                                        (From top ) Jyoti, Dushyant, Jitendra and Ijjyaraj mdash; some of the royal scions who are in the fray                                 
	One is a doctor and is described as a Priyanka Gandhi lookalike, another has an MBA from Columbia University and was a banker, yet another is a passionate photographer and mountaineer.         
	They are all young and restless and have responded to their political calling. Royalty still holds sway in Rajasthan.         
	In Nagaur, where Sonia Gandhi addressed her first rally in Rajasthan last Friday, people seemed more interested in the candidate than the Congress chief herself.         
	Tall, slender and with short-cropped hair, Jyoti Mirdha, 36, from Delhi, is grabbing the maximum eyeballs. Jyoti manages to evoke in Nagaur the kind of response that the Gandhis do in Amethi.         
	Wherever she campaigns, masses come for a glimpse of Baba ki potee (Babas granddaughter) and raise slogans like Baba ki potee, Nagaur ki Jyoti (Jyotis grandfather and Jat leader late Nathu Ram Mirdha was fondly called Baba, and he won the Nagaur Lok Sabha seat five times).        
	The Mirdhas held the Nagaur seat, a Jat stronghold, from 1971 to 1996. Jyoti, a mother of a two-year-old, is here to retrace the political legacy of her family. Jyoti says she wants to take forward her grandfathers good work and serve Nagaur.         
	Pitted against her is grassroots BJP worker and another scion, Bindu Choudhary, 45, whose father Ram Raghunath Choudhary won Nagaur twice on a Congress ticket.         
	In Kota, the Congress has fielded popular royal scion Ijjyaraj Singh, 44, who has an MBA from Columbia University and is known for his clean image. A banker in the US, he returned to India some years ago to look after the family properties in Kota.         
	Gracing social functions and programmes whenever invited, Ijjyaraj is also known for his philanthropy.         
	Ijjyaraj says his priority is the overall development of the Hadauti region. Besides his image as a fresher in politics, the Congress is banking on the royal familys reputation.         
	He is up against first-timer Sham Sharma of the BJP, an engineer with an RSS background.         
	In Alwar, Rahul Gandhis close aide, AICC secretary and royal scion Bhanwar Jitendra Singh, 38, says the royal tag is meaningless if you do not perform and take along all communities. Congress workers say Rahul persuaded him not to fight the Assembly polls in December 2008 and wait for the big one. Although young, Jitendra is a tested politician having won the Assembly elections thrice.         
	A Mayo College alumnus, Jitendra enjoys flying, shooting and mountaineering, besides his first love photography.         
	Jitendra does not make any promise as a principle but hopes to make Alwar with its 52 forts and 100 lakes a major tourist hub, turning round the economy of the place.                 
	Far from Alwar, former journalist Manvendra Singh, 45, better known as son of BJP leader Jaswant Singh, is seeking re-election from the border constituency of Barmer. He is facing a problem this time  former BJP MLA Gangaram Choudhary is miffed with the party and could sway Jat votes away from it  but says he is here to stay even if he loses.         
	Former chief minister Vasundhara Rajes son and MP Dushyant Singh, 36, who is again contesting from Jhalawar-Baran, should face no such problem. His campaign is being managed by his mother.         
	The Doon School alumnus has done well for himself with his mothers help: providing drinking water to over 85 villages, building a sports stadium worth Rs 6.5 crore and a two-lane 85km highway linking Jhalawar with Baran. My work in the area will speak for me, he says.        
	But it is mother Vasundhara who is doing all the talking. While cajoling the electorate, the former chief minister is blunt: It is not Dushyant who is fighting the elections here, just think it is me whos fighting it out and you have to keep my honour intact.        
	 Rajasthan votes on May 7

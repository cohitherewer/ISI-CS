          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 26: The Supreme Court today ordered a judicial probe into last Thursdays clash between police and lawyers on the Madras High Court complex which led to an unprecedented shutdown of all courts in the state.         
	Pending the inquiry, a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan directed the state government to transfer two joint commissioners and three deputy commissioners who were part of the police contingent inside the court on the day of the violence.        
	However, it did not ask for the removal of the Chennai commissioner and the state director-general of police, which was the main demand of the protesting lawyers.        
	Now you withdraw the strike, the Chief Justice told lawyers associations.         
	But the lawyers, who went on strike on January 29 on the Lanka issue, said in Delhi the boycott would continue till the interim probe report came in. In Chennai, the lawyers said they would stay away till the commissioner and the DGP were transferred.        
	 Retired Supreme Court judge B. Srikrishna will head the probe into the violence. He will submit an interim report within two weeks.

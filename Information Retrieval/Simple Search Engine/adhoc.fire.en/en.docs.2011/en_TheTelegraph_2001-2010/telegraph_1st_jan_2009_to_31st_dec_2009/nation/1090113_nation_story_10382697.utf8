                                                                                                               Infosys freeze to save Satyam
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Narayana Murthy                                   
	Calcutta, Jan. 12: Infosys chief mentor N.R. Narayana Murthy today said his company respected Satyams employees and it had decided not to hire them to safeguard the future of the Hyderabad-based firm.        
	Murthys clarifica-tion came against the backdrop of murmurs of resentment among techies to the Infosys stand that the CVs of Satyam employees would not be entertained.        
	We have stated our intention not to act on any CVs received from Satyams employees. This is to ensure that nothing is done that will adversely impact Satyams future, said a statement attribu- ted to Murthy.        
	This is no reflection on the integrity and competence of Satyams employees. We respect them as professionals, the statement added.        
	Murthy said that at a time of crisis, it is important that the industry acts in a responsible and credible manner.        
	The Union government had also passed the word to software companies through Nasscom that they should refrain from poaching Satyams employees as well as key clients.        
	The day the Raju scandal broke, Murthy had said: While what has happened at Satyam is totally regrettable, I believe that it does not represent India.

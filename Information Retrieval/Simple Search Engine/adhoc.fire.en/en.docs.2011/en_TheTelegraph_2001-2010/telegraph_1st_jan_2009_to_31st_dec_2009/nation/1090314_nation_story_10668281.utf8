The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | JD(U), BJP close to deal 
                                                                                                               JD(U), BJP close to deal 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Arun Jaitley                                  
	Patna, March 13: The JD(U) and the BJP are understood to have agreed upon a pre-election alliance with chief minister Nitish Kumar managing to bag the Kishangangj seat for his party, thereby staking claim to 25 seats against the BJPs 15.        
	Nitish, sources said, met BJP general secretary Arun Jaitley and NDAs prime ministerial candidate L.K. Advani today and convinced them to spare the Muslim-dominated Kishenganj for the JD(U).         
	In 2004, the JD(U) contested 24 seats against BJPs 16. A formal announcement of the alliance, however, is yet to be made. Sources said the BJP central leadership would hold another meeting on March 17 to decide on candidates in the wake of Jaitley skipping the poll panel meeting today.         
	In the rival camp, the UPA partners  Ram Vilas Paswans LJP and Lalu Prasads RJD  seemed to be closing their ranks. The RJD is believed to have spared 11-12 seats for the LJP that has been insisting on Jehanabad and Sheohar seats that the RJD won in 2004.         
	RJD general secretary Shyam Razak told The Telegraph from New Delhi: The UPA partners will contest in an alliance in Bihar. But Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan will take a final decision at a meeting tonight.         
	Despite the LJP initially asserting that it would not settle for nothing less than 16 seats and the JD(U) wanting 28 seats, the seat-sharing alliance appeared to have become a compulsion for both the UPA and NDA in Bihar.         
	UPA strategists harbour the belief that the alliance would not have won 29 of 40 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar had Paswan and Lalu Prasad not joined hands in 2004.         
	Similarly, the NDA grapevine has it that Nitish Kumar-led NDA government in Bihar would not have come into existence had the BJP and JD(U) not contested the 2005 Assembly polls together.         
	Moreover, the coming Lok Sabha polls have turned out to be a battle for existence for both Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas, forcing the two warring regional kshatraps to bury the hatchet.         
	Paswan and Lalu Prasad parted ways in the 2005 Assembly election. They fought against each other and perished allowing the Nitish-led NDA to win.         
	The lessons of the 2005 Assembly polls have compelled Paswan and Lalu to come together, a senior UPA leader said.        
	Similarly, despite speculations that Nitish Kumar might go the Naveen Patnaik way in the event of the BJP not agreeing to his demands, the time is certainly not ripe for BJP and JD(U) to part ways.         
	The Nitish Kumar government, surviving on the support of as many as 55 BJP MLAs, still has two years of its tenure left and the JD(U) will have to break the alliance at the risk of losing its government in Bihar.         
	In fact, Nitish Kumar has already clarified that there will not be an Orissa-like situation in Bihar and that the JD(U) and BJP would continue with their alliance.

          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, Dec. 11: A new state of Telangana would require the crown jewel of Hyderabad for economic survival.        
	A source in the Federation of Andhra Pradesh Chamber of Commerce and Industry said Telangana, including Hyderabad, provides nearly 60 per cent of the revenues of the state. But without Hyderabad, the rest of Telangana accounts for around 22 per cent, said a bureaucrat.         
	The lucrative pharmaceutical and IT sectors, which earned huge export revenues, are all located in and around Hyderabad. An estimate of the Software Technology Parks of India says almost 15 per cent of Indias total exports from IT/ITES industries came from Andhra Pradesh. This translated into over Rs 32,000 crore.         
	Coastal Andhra, which has nine districts, provides nearly 29 per cent of the states earnings. The region, which includes Kakinada, has considerable fertiliser capacity and is the hub of giants like Nagarjuna Fertilisers.         
	 A paltry 11 per cent of the revenue comes from Rayalaseema, comprising four districts. The region has deposits of barite and manganese. Rayalaseema does not have any major industries though it has three rivers (Handrineeva, Krishna and Tungabhadra), said T.G. Venkatesh, industrialist and Congress MLA from Kurnool.         
	Telangana has historically opposed the merger with Andhra. They take away our coal and water while we live in poverty and unemployment, said Vinod, a former Telangana Rashtra Samiti MP from Warangal.         
	The Dandakaranya forests dominate five districts of Telangana  Adilabad, Nizamabad, Karimnagar, Warangal and Khammam. A hotbed of Naxalism, these districts did not attract industries or development projects.        
	Education and development have impacted only Hyderabad and three adjoining districts: Medak, Ranga Reddy and Nalgonda. While the rest of Telengana remained underdeveloped, Hyderabad and its neighbours came under the focus of investors from coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema.         
	We made huge investments in these Telangana districts as the environment was conducive. We got cheap labour, abundant water, power and administrative help, said Parvathaneni Gopal Rao, an industrialist from Vijayawada.        
	Public representatives from coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema have demanded compensation of Rs 2 lakh crore for each of the regions towards their investments in Telangana in case Hyderabad is made part of the new state. Most of their investments are in real estate, IT, films, pharmaceuticals, education, hospitals and hotels.        
	Lack of trained manpower and industrial investment are the main reasons for Telanganas economic backwardness in spite of its coal reserves and abundant natural resources like rivers.         
	Though we have huge coal resources, only NTPC has come forward to put up power plants at the pit-head, said Ponnala Lakshmaiah, the states irrigation minister who hails from Warangal.        
	Geographically, the region is at a disadvantage because of the hilly terrain, since it lies at the lower end of the Vindhyas. The region gets less than 15 per cent of the waters of the Krishna and Godavari rivers. This, in spite of 69 per cent of the catchment area of the Krishna and 79 per cent of that of Godavari lying in Telangana.

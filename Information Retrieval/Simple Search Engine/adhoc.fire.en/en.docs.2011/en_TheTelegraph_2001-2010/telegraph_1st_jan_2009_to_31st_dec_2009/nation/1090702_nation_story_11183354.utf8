          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, July 1: Cuttack Chamber of Commerce has urged railway minister Mamata Banerjee to re-route at least 11 trains that do not touch Cuttack and get diverted through the Naraj route after Bhubaneswar.         
	The panel also demanded more attention to be paid to Cuttack railway station, a prime business centre that contributes substantially to the railways income in the eastern zone.        
	Travellers in general and trading community in particular face problems due to the diversion through the Naraj route that excludes Cutack, wrote general secretary B.K. Mohanty.        
	The memorandum, a copy of which was released to the press today, cited a list that included Howrah-Tiruchinapali, Howrah-KanyaKumari, Chennai-Debigar, Chennai-Guwahati, Puri-Ahmedabad Visakhapatnam-Amritsar and Hirakhand expresses, along with Howrah-Puri, Kharagpur-Khurda Road, Puri-Bolangir Inter-city, Bhubaneswar-Sambalpur Inter-city and Angul-Puri passenger trains.        
	This apart, the Konark Express running between Bhubaneswar and Mumbai also needs to be extended, the letter urged.

          ANANYA SENGUPTA                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 25: Police today arrested a man who killed his daughters lover because he felt humiliated after she eloped with the youth from a different community.        
	After sustained interrogation in what could be a case of honour killing, 50-year-old Hema Ram told the police that his daughter Subtis decision to leave the family for a boy who didnt belong to his community had enraged him. He said that he had become a laughing stock in his family and community when his daughter chose to stay in the government womens home instead of returning to them. He decided to avenge his insult, said a police officer.         
	Fifteen-year-old Subti, a resident of Narela in north-west Delhi, eloped with Naresh Rana on March 20. Subti is from the Bishnoi community, but Rana was a Marwari.        
	Ram lodged an FIR the same day against Rana claiming that he had kidnapped his daughter. Rana was arrested by the police and later given bail.         
	Last month, Subti told a city court hearing the case against Rana that she loved him and wanted to marry the 27-year-old youth.        
	She also said that her parents were opposed to the match as Rana was from a different community.         
	Subti said she did not want to return to her parents and would rather stay at Nari Niketan, a home for juveniles in the capital.         
	This proved too much of an insult.         
	On December 16, Ram forcibly took Rana away to his dera (a community settlement) in Narela  the youth was also a resident of the area  with the help of his cousin.        
	The two beat him up with sticks and then throttled him to death. Ram said he dumped Ranas body in a drain after burning it.        
	The half-burnt remains were found in the drain after Rams arrest.         
	He also dumped Ranas motorcycle near his dera. After Rams arrest, we have recovered Ranas half-burnt body from a drain in north-west Delhi, an officer said.         
	In October, 21-year-old Monika Dagar, who married a techie against her familys wishes in Delhi, mysteriously disappeared. Her husband alleged she was a victim of honour killing. Her body has not been found.

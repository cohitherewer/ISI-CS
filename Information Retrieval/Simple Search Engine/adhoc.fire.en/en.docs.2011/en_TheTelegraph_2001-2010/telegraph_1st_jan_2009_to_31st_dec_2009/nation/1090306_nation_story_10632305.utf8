The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Jarring note to IPL from venues
                                                                                                               Jarring note to IPL from venues
          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi, March 5: Tamil Nadu today suggested the Indian Premier League be put off by a month and Bengal rejected the cricket boards revised schedule, drawn up as an alternative to postponement.        
	Its not just the lives of international players but also lakhs of spectators that are at stake, Tamil Nadu chief minister M. Karunanidhi said in a statement two days after the Lahore attack on the Sri Lankan cricket team.        
	Although the Union home minister has suggested the matches could go on after the dates are cleared by state DGPs (police chiefs), I feel we should not take any risks when there is a nation-wide threat of terrorism. It is wiser to be safe now than feel sorry later postponing the matches by a month will not cause any big loss.        
	Karunanidhis statement is significant because the Centre has put the onus on the states to decide if they can provide enough security for the matches to go on. The Centre says it cannot deploy too many paramilitary personnel for the April 10-May 24 matches because of the April 16-May 13 polls.        
	The cricket board had yesterday come up with a revised schedule, mainly shifting matches that coincided with actual election dates. For instance, it brought a match in Calcutta forward from May 13 to May 10.        
	The Centre today sent the revised date list to Bengal, which wrote back objecting to two match dates: May 8 and May 10.        
	We have informed the Centre about our objection to matches being scheduled on May 8 and May 10, since it wouldnt be possible to provide adequate security for the games, Bengal home secretary Ardhendu Sen said.        
	He explained that May 7 would be a polling day in Bengal. How can security personnel work throughout the day for elections and report for duty at the IPL match the very next day?        
	Besides, he said, personnel guarding the Eden Gardens during the May 10 match would have to be given the next day off.        
	That would mean they would report for duty merely 24 hours before the May 13 polls which cover Calcutta and North and South 24-Parganas.        
	Sen said Bengal wanted security personnel posted at a constituency at least 48 hours before polling date. This is possible only with a four-day gap between polling dates and IPL matches.        
	I have been given to believe that the Centre has agreed to revise the dates even further in view of our objections, Sen said. But I can only confirm this tomorrow.        
	Union home ministry officials said they had till this evening not received a reworked IPL schedule from the board following Bengals objections.         
	At an earlier meeting in Delhi, eight state police chiefs had demanded at least three to five paramilitary companies at each IPL match.

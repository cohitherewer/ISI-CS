The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Naga rebel barb at PC
                                                                                                               Naga rebel barb at PC
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                          Chidambaram: Naga ire                                  
	New Delhi, March 28: A top Naga militant has dubbed P. Chidambaram ignorant in an interview published within hours of New Delhi ending two-day talks with his outfit in Zurich on Friday.        
	The interviewer uses even more intemperate language against the home minister.        
	Isak Chishi Swu, chairman of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah), purportedly gave the interview to sympathetic Dutch activist, Frans Welman, on March 10.        
	It was, however, posted on www.tangkhul.com only on Friday, after NSCN general secretary Thuingaleng Muivah and his team had wrapped up talks with home ministry officials and the Centres interlocutor, K. Padmanabhaiah, in the Swiss city.        
	In the interview, Swu tears into New Delhi over the Naga stalemate. Welman, secretary of the Amsterdam-based NGO, Naga International Support Centre, asks Swu: But then you have a (uses intemperate language) like Chidambaram who suddenly says something else. Conditions? He never heard of that, you know.        
	This was a reference to the ministers statement that the talks should be within the ambit of the Indian Constitution. The NSCN is looking for a special federal relationship between Nagaland and India, a demand Delhi has rejected.        
	Swu purportedly says in the interview that a person like him (Chidambaram) does not seem to know that when the negotiations began at the highest level, there had been no conditions. But he is putting condition if he says within the Constitution we did not start talking in that way, so he is completely ignorant, Swu is quoted as saying.        
	A home ministry source said Welman need not be taken seriously. Welman has been lobbying in Europe for the NSCN and its leaders Swu, who divides his time between Manila and Amsterdam, and the Amsterdam-based Muivah.        
	In Zurich, though, the topic was not the Constitution but the ceasefire. Indian officials conveyed Delhis zero tolerance to truce violations, sources said. In recent months, there have been standoffs between NSCN cadres and the Assam Rifles.        
	Chidambaram has told his officials that once the elections end, the Naga issue would be taken up urgently. The rebels, however, suspect Delhi would try to get them to compromise too much.        
	The NSCN has been studying the Indian Constitution for over a year so it can point out which provisions are unacceptable.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | RJDs seat dilemma
                                                                                                               RJDs seat dilemma
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, Feb. 20: Not many may know Anirudh Prasad, alias Sadhu Yadav, but the man is probably Indias shadow railway minister.         
	Sadhu Yadav is Rabri Devis brother, RJDs Gopalganj MP and a man responsible for many a delay of express trains such as Rajdhani at railway stations here. His relationship with his star sister and brother-in-law grants him an edge over other party leaders in RJD.         
	But now the powerful MP is in a quandary because the delimitation commission has notified the Gopalganj Lok Sabha seat as reserved for a Scheduled Caste candidate.         
	Sadhu Yadav, who belongs to Selarkala village of Gopalganj, can no longer contest this seat, as his party leadership would field an SC candidate there. The RJD grapevine has it that Sadhu Yadav is now busy persuading boss Lalu Prasad to field him from the newly created Balmiki Nagar seat, not far from Gopalganj.         
	However, a close colleague of Lalu Prasad in the Union council of ministers, Raghunath Jha, too, is eying this seat and wants Sadhu to shift to Bettiah (West Champaran) instead.         
	In any case Sadhu is in a fix as he is set to lose the home advantage even if he manages to contest from elsewhere. He is not the lone RJD MP who is discovering the going getting touch before polls.         
	RJDs Barh MP Vijay Krishna, who slew JD(U)s Goliath and present chief minister Nitish Kumar from this seat in the 2004 election, now has lost his constituency when its segments merged into Munger and Pataliputra  a new constituency.         
	The RJD leadership is also struggling to grab a seat for Vijay Krishna  a Rajput  who was suited for Rajput-Yadav-Muslim dominated seats.         
	The plights of Union minister Jaiprakash Yadav (Munger), Ranjita Ranjan (Saharsa), Birchand Paswan (Nawada) and Sukhdeo Paswan (Araria) are similar.         
	The Munger seat that Jaiprakash Yadav represents, now exists only in name.                     
	The delimitation commission has thoroughly changed its geography and demography making it difficult for a Yadav nominee to win it. The constituency now has Bhumihar-dominated Sheikhpura and Lakhisarai incorporated in it, inspiring Bhumihar candidates to vie for the seat.         
	Now Jaiprakash Yadav, a Lalu Prasad loyalist is seen loitering around the boss for a shift.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chennai, Aug. 10: A four-year-old asthmatic boy today died in Chennai after probably catching the swine flu virus from his father.        
	Sanjay Balakumars young age and asthma had made him especially vulnerable to the infection, which has so far failed to affect his father, a Madras University professor who recently returned from Singapore, doctors said.        
	Sanjay was the first swine flu patient to die in Chennai.        
	Sanjay died this morning after battling multi-organ failure triggered by the virus.        
	Apparently, the father acted as a carrier and was not affected due to better resistance whereas the younger and more vulnerable Sanjay, who also had asthma, picked up the virus easily, said Dr S. Ilango, director of public health.        
	His elder brother Aditya, 7, too has tested positive and has been quarantined.        
	Dr N. Prahlad of Mehta Hospital, where Sanjay was admitted on Friday, said the boy may have died of septic shock leading to organ failure.        
	The rapidity with which his organs failed as he was being transferred from another hospital points to the debilitating effect the virus had on his body. Being an asthmatic made him an easy host for the virus; he had lower resistance to combat the disease, Dr Prahlad said.        
	As news channels announced Sanjays death, panicked parents rushed to his school, Askhaya Matriculation in Velachery, and took their children home. The school declared a weeks holiday.

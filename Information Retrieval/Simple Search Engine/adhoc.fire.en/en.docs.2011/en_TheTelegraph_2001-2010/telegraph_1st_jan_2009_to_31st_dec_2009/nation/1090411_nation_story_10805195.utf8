The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Jindal dodges shoe missile
                                                                                                               Jindal dodges shoe missile
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chandigarh, April 10: A retired schoolteacher today flung his shoe at Congress MP Naveen Jindal, apparently furious because his son had lost his data-entry job at Kurukshetra university.        
	Raj Bal Singhs missile, however, flew past Jindal who was addressing a workers convention at Kurukshetra Congress Bhavan. The 64-year-old had been protesting Haryanas government job policy and was drunk, police said.        
	This is the second time this week that a shoe has been thrown at a Congress leader. A journalist had targeted home minister P. Chidambaram after Jagdish Tytler was given a clean chit in the 1984 riots.        
	I was sitting on the dais with local leaders when this aged person rose up shouting and flung his shoe towards me. He was immediately taken away and handed to police, Jindal, 39, said.        
	Jindal, who will be contesting the Kurukshetra seat, said he had pardoned the teacher but suspected the Indian National Lok Dal could have a hand in it.        
	I am told the man was naming the INLD while he was being taken away by some workers. The law should now take its course. The Election Commission must take notice of this, he said.        
	INLD leader .P. Chautala trashed the allegation. Since when has the Congress been allowing other party members to attend their meeting?        
	K.V. Ramana, the Kurukshetra SP, said Raj was not authorised to enter the Congress Bhavan premises. We are investigating whether Raj has any political links.

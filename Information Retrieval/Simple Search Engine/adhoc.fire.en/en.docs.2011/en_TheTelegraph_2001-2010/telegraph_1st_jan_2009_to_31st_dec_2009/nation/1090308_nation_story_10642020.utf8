The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CPM sacks Modi fan
                                                                                                               CPM sacks Modi fan
          JOHN MARY                               
	Thiruvananthapuram, March 7: The CPM today sacked a Kerala MP it had suspended earlier for praising Narendra Modi, cracking the whip on an out-of-favour minority mascot who dared to see something good in the riot-tainted Gujarat leader.        
	Sources said A.P. Abdulla Kutty was defying party policies and making overtures to the Congress-led opposition UDF. The Kannur district committee said Kutty had refused to make amends even during his suspension.        
	Kutty was suspended after he said in Dubai last year that the Left should ponder why Ratan Tata shifted his Nano project to Gujarat from CPM-ruled Bengal. He had continued to laud the Gujarat chief minister though he made it clear his praise was limited to Modis development drive.         
	Ive been victimised for airing my opinions fearlessly. The party is intolerant and is trying to brand me a Modi fan, reading out of context my statement, Kutty said after his expulsion. If I were to praise Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit nobody would discuss it.        
	CPM sources said the party found it unthinkable for a member to see anything good in a man who blinked while his supporters massacred innocent Muslims.        
	Kutty, once the Kerala CPMs minority mascot, had suffered progressive demotion from area committee to the local committee and the branch committee. The expulsion came within 24 hours after Kutty refused to renew his membership at the branch assigned to him.        
	Congress leader M.I. Shanavas said the Modi comment was a blemish on Kutty.        
	Wait and watch, Muslim League leader E.T. Mohammed Basheer said, when a reporter asked him if party doors were open to Kutty.

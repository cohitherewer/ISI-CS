	Patna, Sept. 8: Chief minister Nitish Kumars quieter battle against political nepotism has been lost in the clamour for seats with leaders trying to push family cause across the country.        
	While in Bihar, Nitish denied tickets to relatives of two JD(U) MPs, in Andhra Pradesh a furore arose over the question of annexation with Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy eyeing the vacant CM seat after the death of YSR.        
	In Uttar Pradesh, Samajvadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, too, showed preference for a family member, in his case daughter-in-law Dimple, for the Ferozabad seat, over ally and LJP boss Ram Vilas Paswan.         
	The Ferozabad seat was vacated by Mulayams son, Akhilesh Yadav.        
	By preferring family over others, Mulayam did what Paswan had done so far. Paswans brother, Pashupati Nath Paras, is an LJP MLA in the Bihar Assembly and another Ramchander Paswan was an LJP MP till he was defeated in the last Lok Sabha polls.         
	Paswan who also lost his Hajipur seat in the Lok Sabha polls is allegedly unhappy over Mulayams decision.        
	Lalu Prasad took wife Rabri Devi from the kitchen to the chief ministers chair in 1997. Now, Lalu is the RJD boss while his spouse is the leader of the Opposition in the Assembly.         
	Lalus brother-in-law, Sadhu Yadav, deserted RJD only when the party denied him a ticket.        
	Reportedly, Nitishs strict no to leaders has led to rebellion. JD(U)s Jehanabad and Balmikinagar MPs, Jagdish Sharma and Purnamasi Ram, respectively, have fielded wife and son as Independents on seats vacated by them.        
	With politics being a family trade in this country, many JD(U) leaders believe that Nitish is being illogical.        
	His idea (of denying tickets to family members) is anachronistic. Why should I spare a seat that I have been winning for three decades to others, asked a JD(U) leader on condition of anonymity.         
	However, the chief ministers idea has been concurred by JD(U) boss Sharad Yadav. Devoted party cadre suffer due to their leaders proclivity to promote the family members. This decision to not promote the family is in the wider interest of the party, he said.        
	A product of the JP Movement and a socialist by principal, Nitishs brother, Satish Kumar, is an ayurvedic doctor at Bakhtiyarpur, his birthplace, and son Nishant has stayed far away from politics.         
	It is too early to say if he will eventually succeed in this personal war.         
	But, voters believe that the chief minister will be in constant pressure from his own party to give up his policy. As, many senior leaders have been training their sons as prospective successors.

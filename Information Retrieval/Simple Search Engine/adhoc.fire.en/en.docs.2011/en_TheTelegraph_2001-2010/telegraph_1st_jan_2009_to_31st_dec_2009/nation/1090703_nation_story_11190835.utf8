                                                                                                               Jaya names influence minister
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chennai, July 2: Jayalalithaa today claimed that A. Raja of the DMK was the Union minister who allegedly tried to influence a Madras High Court judge to grant anticipatory bail to two persons.        
	Justice R. Regupathi had revealed on Monday that a Union minister had asked him to grant bail to a doctor and his son in a forgery case.         
	Jayalalithaa pointed out that communications minister Rajas nephew and two nieces were business partners of C. Krishnamurthy, an accused in the case.         
	The ADMK leader, a former chief minister, said: It does not require superhuman intelligence to conclude that it was none other than the telecom scam-tainted A. Raja (who called the judge).         
	Asked about Jayalalithaas allegation, Raja said: I refute the charges. They are politically motivated.        
	Jayalalithaa observed that in January, the media had revealed that three of Rajas relatives were shareholders in Krishnamurthys real estate company. His nephew R. Sridhar  whom Raja made a deputy director in the Union environment ministry  allegedly failed to disclose to the ministry that he still had a stake in a private company.        
	As Rajas financial position improved so did the fortunes of C. Krishnamurthy, Jayalalithaa said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | US to quiz Pak accused, brief India
                                                                                                               US to quiz Pak accused, brief India
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                          Kasab: What next?                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 18: US investigators have been allowed by Pakistan to quiz suspects rounded up in connection with the Mumbai terror attacks, Indian sources have said.        
	Although a shade delayed, India will receive information the suspects rounded up in Pakistan are expected to cough up. The information will be routed through the US which has played a key role in the unparalleled exchange of evidence between the neighbours after the attacks.        
	Islamabad is handing over the suspects to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for interrogation in Pakistan, home ministry sources told The Telegraph. Lashkar-e-Toiba leaders Zarar Shah and Zaki-ur Rehman Lakhvi are expected to be interrogated by US agencies. The number of suspects handed over, however, is not known.         
	The suspects may not be flown out of Pakistan but the US federal agency has managed to get access to them as well as records of the investigation.        
	The US has been proactive after the Mumbai incident, constantly in touch with governments of both countries and sharing information with Indian authorities. Once enough information is exchanged, India may take a decision on direct exchanges with Pakistan, going beyond what is contained in the dossier sent to Islamabad.        
	The US has kept a gimlet eye on the case at a time revelations are suggesting that at least two CIA officers  a 57-year-old man and a 45-year-old woman  were among those killed in the assault on the Taj hotel in November.        
	They were probably not targeted, a home ministry source said, suggesting they were shot by the terrorists as hotel guests without being aware of their antecedents.        
	Israeli agencies, too, are understood to have been involved in the probe, though not as openly as that of the US.        
	Interrogation of Ajmal Kasab, the sole surviving terrorist in Mumbai police custody now, has revealed that the squad was specifically asked to target Americans and Jews.        
	Investigators are now wondering whether the terrorists had some information that made them seek out the Chabad House in Colaba and kill several of the inmates.        
	Indian intelligence agencies do not commit that the Jewish prayer house was a pre-determined target that was probably visited by operatives of the Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad. But a source said it was not unusual for foreign intelligence agencies to collect information in India.        
	The US ambassador to India, David C. Mulford, called on home minister P. Chidambaram yesterday for a 30-minute interaction on the recent developments surrounding the probe. It was a courtesy call, he said later.        
	The frequency of meetings in Delhi between Indian and American officials has increased since November.        
	Prime suspect label         
	A Pakistani prosecutor has claimed that his country had formally sought the custody of Ajmal Kasab, terming the terrorist the prime suspect and linking the handover to the trial of the abettors.        
	The Government of Pakistan has formally requested the Indian government to hand over the custody of Ajmal Kasab because he is the prime suspect and the rest... are abettors, they abetted the crime, deputy attorney-general Sardar Mohammad Ghazi told Dawn News channel. He, however, refused to give any details about when Islamabad made the request.        
	In Delhi, foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee said the Indian government was yet to receive any official communication from Pakistan seeking Kasabs custody.

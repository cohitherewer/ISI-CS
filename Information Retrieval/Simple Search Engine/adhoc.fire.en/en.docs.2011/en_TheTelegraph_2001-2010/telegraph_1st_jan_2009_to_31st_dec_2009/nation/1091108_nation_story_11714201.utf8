	Srinagar, Nov. 7: The mysterious death of a man who neighbours said was a caring father and husband led to violent clashes today between protesters and security forces in Srinagar, leaving several people injured.        
	Police had to fire in the air and lob tear gas shells to disperse a mob that enforced a shutdown and broke windowpanes of several vehicles.        
	Mohammad Maqbool Ganai, 42, a roadside barbecue-vendor in the volatile Maisuma locality, was found with his throat slit early this morning.        
	The police said the body of Ganai, father of two minor sons, had multiple injuries and that he may have been attacked with a sharp weapon.         
	As news of Ganais death spread, a large number of youths from Sarai Bal, Maisuma and some adjoining localities gathered and enforced a shutdown in several parts of the city centre. Soon, vehicles went off the roads.        
	The police swung into action and lobbed tear gas shells at youths who threw stones at them.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Best friend, on robber-infested highways, too
                                                                                                               Best friend, on robber-infested highways, too
          G.C. SHEKHAR                           Seetharaman with his dogs                                  
	Chennai, Aug. 9: When you are 78, have enemies eyeing a prime property and are driving alone on a dark highway, you better have a loaded pistol for protection. Or a pair of devoted dogs.         
	A septuagenarian lawyers German Shepherd and mongrel barked furiously to scare away attackers who waylaid him as he drove home to Chennai on July 8, causing one of their vehicles to careen off the highway and the other to back off.         
	W.S. Seetharaman was coming from Kodaikanal when the attackers, travelling in two mini-trucks, chased and caught up with his Maruti Alto near Dindigul, around 420km from Chennai.        
	Suddenly, the two big vehicles sandwiched my car and menacing-looking men were angrily gesticulating at me. For a moment, I thought I had caused an accident but when I lowered my window, one of the guys, brandishing a sickle, ordered me to stop. I suspected highway dacoity, said Seetharaman, 78.        
	Still sprightly for his age, the lawyer, once a junior to A.K. Sen, law minister in the Indira Gandhi cabinet in the late 1960s, said one of the men grabbed his rear-view mirror while another tried to prise open the rear door with a sickle.        
	Then, for a moment, as the two vehicles slid back a little, I lowered the rear windows. I shouted busko, a code for my two dogs to attack. Immediately, they leaned out of the window and started barking furiously, he recalled.        
	The attackers were taken by surprise by the sight of the two dogs snarling at them. The driver of the vehicle on the left lost control and went off the highway. The other vehicle kept banging into the side of my car but the relentless barking forced it to back off as well, said Seetharaman, who was alone because a junior colleague who normally accompanies him to Kodaikanal couldnt come this time.        
	Out of danger, the lawyer accelerated, stopping only two hours later to take a break. There, he hugged his pets, mongrel Picasso and German Shepherd Carmen Miranda, both 5 years old.        
	The lawyer, who lives alone in Chennai, said the attackers could have been engaged by a group of people trying to usurp a Kodaikanal bungalow he jointly holds with his sisters-in-law.         
	They had tried to foist a false case earlier. It is possible they decided to threaten me physically, he said. His car still bears the marks of that night attack.        
	Dindigul police chief K. Chinnasamy sent a sub- inspector to Chennai to take a complaint from Seetharaman.         
	Since I had fleetingly seen a signboard that read Vadamadurai, I told the police that the attack occurred somewhere in that vicinity, he said.         
	We are investigating the incident and also looking at the possible property angle, the SP said.        
	Asked if it was not risky to drive alone at his age, Seetharaman laughed, saying he had always been a sportsperson and played polo regularly. Even now, I swim at least thrice a week.         
	But some of the confidence also comes from the pets, he said, proudly pointing to his furry companions.

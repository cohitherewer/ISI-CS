          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Krishna Tirath                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 11: Parents of girls about to marry should buy insurance schemes for their daughters to help them tackle any dowry-related problems, including violence, women and child development minister Krishna Tirath said today.         
	The proposal, articulated by Tirath at a news conference, immediately drew concern from her officials  worried the suggestion could be viewed as legitimising dowry.         
	The suggestion, ministry sources clarified, reflects only the ministers views and was not under the consideration of the ministry.         
	Parents, with perhaps some help from the government, can buy insurance for their daughters at the time of marriage, so that if she is harmed by her in-laws subsequently, she has money for treatment, Tirath said.         
	The minister was explaining a plan for insurance and social security for housewives, who often face the challenge of severing ties with abusive in-laws because they are not economically independent.         
	But the proposal effectively places the responsibility for a daughters safety after marriage solely on her parents, replacing the ancient practice of dowry with an insurance.         
	The proposal also accepts as fait accompli domestic violence after marriage, and makes parents responsible for a womans care if she is victimised.         
	The National Mission for Empowerment of Women  an umbrella programme to dovetail all existing women-centric schemes  is ready for launch, Tirath said.         
	The government will triple its funding for the National Commission for Women, from Rs 5 crore to Rs 15 crore, the minister said.         
	Tirath announced plans for a new scheme  Sabla  aimed at improving nutritional and health conditions of girls between 11 and 18.         
	She also proposed starting special economic zones for women entrepreneurs.

                                                                                                               Maoists massacre   10 cops   in Bihar
          NALIN VERMA                                          
	Patna, Feb. 9: Maoists ambushed a police patrol and killed 10 of the 14 personnel near the Bihar-Jharkhand border this afternoon, first triggering a landmine blast and then raining bullets.        
	The inspector-general of police (Patna), Sunil Kumar, said the rebels had taken away 11 police firearms from the attack site at Mahulitar village, 230km from here, in Bihars Naxalite-dominated Nawada district.        
	Police sources said hundreds of Maoists, hiding in the bushes and hills, had been waiting for the police jeep to arrive in Mahulitar to supervise saint Ravidass birth anniversary celebrations. They had planted mines on the road.        
	The 2pm blast threw the jeep into the air, killing eight persons on the spot. Two seriously injured policemen died sometime later as the rebels bullets kept the other survivors from coming to their aid.        
	Reinforcements have been sent and the police have engaged the rebels in an encounter, additional director-general (headquarters) Neelmani claimed.         
	But its still premature to confirm the casualties on either side.        
	The slain policemen include four Special Auxiliary Force jawans, four Bihar Military Police jawans, Kauwakol police station officer-in-charge Rameshwar Ram and an assistant sub-inspector.

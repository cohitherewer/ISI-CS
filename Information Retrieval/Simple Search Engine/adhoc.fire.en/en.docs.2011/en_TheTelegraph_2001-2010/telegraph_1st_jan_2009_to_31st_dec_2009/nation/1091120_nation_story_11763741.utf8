          AMIT GUPTA                               
	Ranchi, Nov. 19: Madhu Koda failed to turn up before enforcement directorate (ED) officials for the third time today, choosing to spend the time campaigning for his Assembly poll nominees.        
	Sources said the officials were left with no option but to issue an arrest warrant against the former chief minister.         
	Koda, who was issued summons last week to appear today, had not arrived at the ED office till 8.30pm. Yesterday, he had denied receiving the summons. Earlier, he had failed to meet the sleuths on November 13 and 15.        
	Koda has been charged with money-laundering and illegal investments of over Rs 2,000 crore.        
	Officially, the EDs lawyer, S.R. Das, said no decision had been taken on the next step. It is not yet decided what action the ED will take against Koda.        
	As the officials waited in Ranchi, Koda held a rally for the candidates of his fledgling political outfit in Singhbhum, of which he is the MP.         
	He has fielded seven candidates in the area for the state elections starting next week.        
	The sources said Koda had spoken at the poll gatherings about attending Parliaments winter session, which began today.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 31: The Srikshetra Milita Sangram Samiti, a joint body of organisations with temple priests as members, has decided not to allow VIPs visit Puri on New Years day, forcing the chief minister to cancel his scheduled visit to the pilgrim town.         
	It has been a tradition for chief ministers to visit Jagannath Temple on the January 1st every year to seek the lords blessings.        
	But this year, Naveen Patnaik will have to break that tradition in view of the announcement. The chief minister has cancelled his proposed visit, confirmed an official release issued by the chief ministers office.         
	However, the chief minister hopes that the lakhs of devotees who congregate on the same day will have a peaceful darshan. Priests of Jagannath temple have been demanding repeal of some provisions of the Jagannath Temple Act that provide for disciplinary action against them.         
	Meanwhile, the government has announced to give back the amruta manohi daan rights to the priests.

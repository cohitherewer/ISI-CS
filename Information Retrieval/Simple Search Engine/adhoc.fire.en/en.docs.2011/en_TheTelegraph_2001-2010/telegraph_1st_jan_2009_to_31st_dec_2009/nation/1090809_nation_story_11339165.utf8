	New Delhi, Aug. 8: India lost a second patient infected with the pandemic flu today while the number of infections climbed to 782 with signs of community or local transmission from at least four cities.         
	A 53-year-old woman with acute respiratory distress syndrome, who was brought on Friday evening to the governments Kasturba Hospital in Mumbai, died this afternoon, a doctor at the hospital told The Telegraph.         
	The woman had a history of diabetes and high blood pressure and would thus have been classified among patients at high risk of developing complications from the flu infection, the doctor said.         
	The woman appeared to have been under treatment from a private clinic for a few days before she was taken to a private hospital on Friday from where she was referred to the Kasturba Hospital, the doctor said.         
	She had tested positive for the pandemic H1N1 virus this morning, the doctor added.         
	Tests also confirmed the H1N1 infection in 70 other persons in eight other cities today.         
	Among them, 58 people, including 33 in Pune, appear to have picked up the virus from school or social contacts with previously infected people.         
	The health ministry said tonight that 11 persons in Delhi, 10 in Bangalore and four in Chennai who were found infected had no history of foreign travel  a sign of the local spread of the virus.         
	A 14-year-old girl infected with the H1N1 virus had died in Pune earlier this week.         
	The test results released today suggest on a second consecutive day that the deeper the search for the virus within the community, the greater might be the number of people found infected.         
	The new number of infections today was 71.         
	On Friday  two days after the government asked everyone with flu symptoms to seek evaluation at designated government clinics  the number of new positive cases jumped to 96  three times higher than the highest daily count in the past three weeks.         
	A public health specialist said that as the virus spreads, it is important for the government to issue clear advisories to the private medical sector on the criteria for selecting patients with symptoms for testing so that patients at risk get early testing  and possible treatment if found infected.         
	The very young, the aged, pregnant women, and patients with asthma, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases are at high risk of developing complications.

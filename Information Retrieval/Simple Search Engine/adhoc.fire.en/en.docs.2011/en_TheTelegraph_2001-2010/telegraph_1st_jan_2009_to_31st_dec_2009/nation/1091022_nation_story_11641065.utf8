          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, Oct. 21: Armed rebels and a combined force comprising members of district police, SAP and CRPF jawans exchanged fire in Barsudhi forest under the Barachatti police station area near Bihar-Jharkhand border, some 50km from Gaya, on Wednesday morning.         
	The exchange lasted for 90 minutes and the two sides fired several hundred rounds, with more than a hundred rounds being fired by policemen alone.        
	According to Gaya superintendent of police Sushil Khopde, the police received a tip-off about rebels organising a training camp in the forests. A team of hundred personnel comprising district police, SAP (special police force with former army personnel formed to combat Naxalites) and CRPF were constituted.         
	The men rushed to the forested area and a gun battle ensued.        
	Khopde said though no actual count of ammunition was made, personnel are believed to have fired more than hundred rounds forcing rebels to make a retreat. The police superintendent added that no casualty was reported on either side.         
	A combing operation has been started, said Khopde, who is camping in the area.         
	This is the second such encounter in recent days between policemen and Naxalites in Barachatti area. Some days ago, a gun battle ensued between police and rebels under the Barachatti police station area.         
	Maoists of late have stepped up activities on the BiharJharkhand border.        
	During the two-day Maoist bandh, rebels took out torchlight processions, blew up mobile phone towers, burnt effigies of UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and home minister P. Chidambram.         
	The rebels also dug ditches on roads to disrupt communication.        
	Banka blast        
	Maoists blew up a state-run primary school at Gerua village under Belhar police station area in Banka early today.         
	The administration earlier had planned to set up a police post at the school.         
	Over 100 rebels surrounded the building around 2.3am and used dynamites for the explosion, causing the roof of the three-room school to cave in and leaving the furniture badly damaged.         
	The school was adjacent to the Sangrampur block office which was blown up by Maoists last week.         
	Senior officers are camping in the area and a combing operation has been launched.

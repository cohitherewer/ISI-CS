The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | President call 
                                                                                                               President call 
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, May 16: The unexpected mandate in the ruling UPAs favour, though short of the magic number of 272, has taken a load off President Pratibha Patils shoulders. Time-honoured conventions will take care of the rest.         
	No more number-crunching for the President, sounding out parties to find out who enjoys the confidence of the House or conferring with legal experts. The focus of millions on the fore courts of Rashtrapati Bhavan is off.         
	The President can now fall back on the tested principle of inviting the largest pre-poll combination, since no party enjoys a clear majority in the new House, a path that several Presidents have trod without courting much controversy.         
	The President should immediately invite whoever is elected the leader of the Congress Legislature Party (as the largest constituent of the UPA) to form a government, without any conditions, former law minister and constitutional expert Shanti Bhushan said.         
	There can be no conditions now, the results are so unambiguous, he said. No letters of support, no confidence vote, nothing. All this has now become irrelevant, he said. Constitutional expert Rajeev Dhavan backed his stand. Since the numbers were so clear, there was no need to insist on a confidence vote, he said.

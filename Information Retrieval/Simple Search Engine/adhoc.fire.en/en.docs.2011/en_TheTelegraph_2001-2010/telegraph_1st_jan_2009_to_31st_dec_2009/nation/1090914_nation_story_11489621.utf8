The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sex racket busted at orphanage
                                                                                                               Sex racket busted at orphanage
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 13: The police commissionerate rescued 24 minor girls late last night from a shelter home run by a Chandrashekharpur-based NGO, Basanti Trust, after receiving a complaint that a sex racket was being run on the premises of the orphanage-cum-remand home.        
	The polices scientific squad today seized CDs containing pornographic material, a computer, video cameras and electronic gadgets used for audio and film recording from the home run by Basanti Trust.        
	In the meantime, Mahila police station personnel took the inmates for medical tests and continued their interrogation of Byomkesh Tripathy, the trust owner. Ironically, the trust also ran a parallel marriage bureau.        
	They would shoot dirty films and videos in the home and the practise was on for many months. Young girls would be sexually tormented and would be forced to either film or flee. When I protested, they raped me, said the home caretaker, who lodged an FIR with the Chandrashekharpur police last evening.        
	The woman (name withheld) had first approached the city-based Sanjeevani, an organisation working for women. Sanjeevani took the caretaker to the police to lodge an FIR. Based on the FIR, police raided the orphanage late last night and rescued the girls in the presence of a large number of residents. Agitated neighbours today ransacked the building and damaged the office compound wall. Many complained that they had an idea of the racket, but kept mum because the police would not help.        
	We had an idea of the goings-on. At times some of us also tried to approach the police, but the force took no action. So, we decided to stay quiet as well, said Bijaya Rana, a neighbour.        
	Organisations without registration and notification records and minus proper documents that prove their authenticity should not be given permission to run shelter homes, said Pitambar Sethi, another resident of the area.        
	Meanwhile, the owner of the trust, Byomkesh Tripathy has refuted all allegations.         
	This is a conspiracy. I was never involved in any racket. Let the police probe into the case and arrest me if Im guilty, Tripathy said while talking to The Telegraph.         
	He, however, failed to explain how pornographic CDs and cameras and other electronic equipment used for audio and film recording were seized by the police from the remand home premises.         
	For now, the inmates have been sent to Child-line, yet another shelter home and interrogation is on, said Bilasini Nayak, inspector in charge of Mahila police station.

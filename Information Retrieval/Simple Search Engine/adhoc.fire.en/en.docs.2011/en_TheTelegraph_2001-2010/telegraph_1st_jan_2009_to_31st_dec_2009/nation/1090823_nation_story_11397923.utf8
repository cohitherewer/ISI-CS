The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Vasundhara sets terms 
                                                                                                               Vasundhara sets terms 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Vasundhara outside Advanis residence in Delhi on Saturday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 22: The impasse in the BJP could not be resolved this evening as Vasundhara Raje set conditions for her resignation as Opposition leader while assuring party president Rajnath Singh of her readiness to abide by his directive.        
	Vasundhara today called on Rajnath and L.K. Advani.        
	Sources claimed Vasundhara was not quarrelling with Rajnath for her own survival but was expressing her determination to fight for an honourable exit.        
	The central leaders will now have to discuss the demands of the former Rajasthan chief minister and get back to her before expecting a solution.        
	The tug-of-war has come a day after Rajnaths muscle-flexing in Shimla that culminated in a declaration that no act of indiscipline would be tolerated.        
	Vasundhara had indicated that she was not going to bow out of office without a respectable bargain.        
	Even after the partys decision to expel Jaswant Singh, Vasundhara had not betrayed any signs of nervousness and her aides had kept referring to the support of majority of MLAs. Sources said she argued her case before Advani and Rajnath armed with letters of support from over 50 legislators.        
	Sources close to her had maintained that she would not relinquish office unless the central leaders displayed a sense of accommodation. Her belief that she was being hounded out for no fault of hers had not changed despite the sustained pressure from the high command.        
	She reluctantly agreed to avoid a confrontation but only on condition that she had a say in the changes in the Rajasthan unit.        
	The post of state unit president has already gone to one of her detractors and she does not want to vacate the space in the Assembly in favour of a rival. She has firmly told the high command that the legislature party leader must be from her camp. She also wants her loyalists who had been suspended reinstated.        
	MP book cry        
	The Congress has borrowed a leaf from Narendra Modis book and demanded a ban on Jaswant Singhs Jinnah: India, Partition, Independence, adds our special correspondent in Bhopal.        
	Madhya Pradesh Congress spokesperson K.K. Mishra issued a statement asking for ban on the book across the state.        
	But chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, heading a BJP government, has adopted a cautious stand. Asked if he would follow the ban imposed on the book by the Gujarat government, Chauhan said: I do not think so. I do not see the need for it.         
	The chief minister, however, insisted that he had the highest regard for Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel  the Gujarat government had cited critical references to him to ban the book.        
	State Congress chief Suresh Pachauri, too, said: We are yet to decide about it. So far, we have not demanded a ban on the book.

	Chinsurah, June 4: Trinamul Congress and CPM workers clashed today in Hooghly, a day after a worker of the Opposition party was burnt to death allegedly by activists of the CPM.        
	Judhistir Dolui, the president of the SC/ST cell of Trinamul in Khanakul, was burnt to death in the Left stronghold last night.        
	At Pursurah in Arambagh subdivision, where Trinamul had called a 12-hour bandh today, about 50 of its supporters gathered around 11.15am for a protest rally. Suddenly, about 20 CPM activists, armed with pipe guns, ran towards them firing. But soon, about 200 more Trinamul workers arrived at the spot.         
	In the clash that followed, bombs were hurled. Trinamul workers then marched to areas in a village where houses of CPM supporters were located. They ransacked 35 houses and set fire to two.        
	A team of 25 policemen arrived in two vehicles and chased the mob with sticks. Five persons were arrested, said Hooghly district superintendent of police Rajeev Mishra.        
	Trinamul activists ransacked and looted several houses belonging to our supporters. They also set fire to two homes, one belonging to local committee member Mrityunjoy Malik. Police were totally inactive. Many CPM supporters have fled their homes, said Asit Patra, a CPM district secretariat member.

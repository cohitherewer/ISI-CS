The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong thinks CM before vote count
                                                                                                               Cong thinks CM before vote count
          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 19: The Congress has started worrying about the next chief minister of Maharashtra, oblivious to the possibility of an election setback when the votes are counted this Thursday.        
	Central leaders admitted that the presence of too many contenders for the chief ministers post would make the choice extremely difficult.         
	Maharashtra state Congress president Manikrao Thakre, who is in Delhi with his supporters to lobby for the post, told reporters today that the focus was not on the counting on October 22 as the Congress-NCP was certain to form a government.         
	We will not need others as the Congress-NCP will cross the magic figure. If the rebels and the Independents want to support us, they are welcome, he said, discounting forecasts that the NCPs tally would decline significantly.         
	Other Maharashtra leaders, who think the Congress score will almost be double the NCPs, privately said the complexity of the post-poll situation could be foreseen in the aspirations of people like Thakre. He is lobbying for himself and there are half a dozen more candidates. If they can dream of becoming the CM, a dozen more will spring up after the results, a Maharashtra leader said.         
	Unlike in Haryana or Arunachal Pradesh, where the incumbent chief ministers are certain to retain their chairs, Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan has been just another face in the race.         
	Party sources said Chavan may be knocked out of the chief ministers race instantly if the Congress-NCP alliance failed to muster majority on its own. In such a crunch situation, names like Vilasrao Deshmukh and Narayan Rane will automatically take the centre stage.         
	Officially, the party has not backed Chavan till now. Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said the elected representatives would choose their leader in consultation with the high command. Mohan Prakash, the AICC secretary in charge of Maharashtra, said the chief minister issue would be decided only after the results.         
	Thakre, too, said the high command would decide who would be the chief minister. Asked if Chavan was the automatic choice, he said this did not happen in the Congress.         
	Thakre is a lightweight in the race. Chavan, Deshmukh, Sushil Kumar Shinde and Rane are some of the big names. Senior leaders Patangrao Kadam and Rohidas Patil fancy themselves as compromise candidates.         
	The names of central leaders Prithviraj Chavan and Shivraj Patil are also doing the rounds as possible nominees in case no compromise is reached among the warring factions in the state.         
	An angle that has grabbed the central leaders attention is the new axis between Deshmukh and Rane. Deshmukh, whose chances of getting the reins for the third time appear slim, has planned to back Ranes claim to eliminate Chavan from the race. In the second stage, sources said, if Rane, too, faces opposition, because of his Shiv Sena background, Deshmukh will push his own case.        
	On the other hand, leaders such as Gurudas Kamat feel the chief ministers job should be given to someone from Mumbai for a change.               
	In 2004, the Congress had to wrestle with the NCP for several days to decide the chief minister.

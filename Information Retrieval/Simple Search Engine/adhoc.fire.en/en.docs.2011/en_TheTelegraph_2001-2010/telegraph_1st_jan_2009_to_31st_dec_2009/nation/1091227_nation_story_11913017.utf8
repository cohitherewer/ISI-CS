	Dec. 26: Jharkhand Mukti Morcha chief Shibu Soren today staked claim to form the state government, handing the governor a list of 42 MLAs that included members of the BJP, All Jharkhand Students Union and an Independent.        
	The Janata Dal (United), which has two MLAs, later gave the Raj Bhavan a letter of support, raising Sorens numbers to 44 in the 81-member Assembly and appearing to end the climate of uncertainty in the state.        
	I am going to form the government, Soren said while leaving the Raj Bhavan.        
	Governor K. Sankaranarayanan did not indicate if and when Soren would be invited to form the government.        
	The list given to him at 3pm names 18 legislators each from the JMM and the BJP, five from Ajsu and Independent member Bandhu Tirkey. Two other Independents, Chamra Linda and Videsh Singh, too, appear likely to support the government.        
	Under a proposed power-share formula, whose details are being worked out, the JMM will keep the chief ministers post and three cabinet berths. The BJP will get four berths, Ajsu three and the JD(U) one. The BJP is likely to get the Speakers post.        
	If sworn in, this would be the 65-year-old Sorens third term as chief minister. He will not miss the ironies in what is a dream comeback for him.        
	Raja Peter, one of the two JD(U) MLAs supporting him, was the reason behind Soren losing the top job in January. Peter, contesting on a Jharkhand Party ticket, had then defeated Soren in the Tamar bypoll but may now be rewarded with a ministers post.        
	The BJP too had denied Soren the chief ministers post in 2000  when Jharkhand was formed and the JMM was part of the NDA  saying the party with the most lawmakers was entitled to the chair. This time the Disom Guru played his cards well and forced the BJP to accept him as chief minister.        
	An unfazed Congress, which believes its refusal to support Soren will help it in the long run, has begun concentrating on exposing the BJPs opportunism.        
	The party expects a JMM-BJP government to be quickly discredited, even collapse, allowing the Congress-Jharkhand Vikas Morcha to step in with a stronger claim.        
	We want the BJP to form the government with Soren quickly, today itself, and invite the wrath of the voters, Congress spokesman Shakeel Ahmed said.        
	General secretary Janardan Dwivedi said the BJPs decision to back Soren had exposed its doublespeak and hunger for power. If you recall what the BJP had been saying about Soren in the past few years, you will understand the BJPs character, he said.        
	Accusing the JMM of winning with Maoist support, the Congresss Manish Tewari wondered how the BJP could take a tough line on the rebels now. Tewari recalled the BJP was crying hoarse about Sorens criminal past till yesterday.        
	The BJP had launched a massive campaign against tainted ministers in 2004 primarily because of the presence of the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the JMM in the Union ministry. It later stalled Parliament for days when Soren refused to quit the cabinet after being charge-sheeted.        
	The BJP leaders who accompanied Soren to the Raj Bhavan today were Yash- want Sinha, Ananth Kumar, Raghubar Das and Arjun Munda. Former BJP president Rajnath Singh, who arrived in Ranchi last night after being appointed political manager by his successor Nitin Gadkari, did not accompany them.        
	The Congress mounted a last-ditch effort to win over Ajsu chief Sudesh Mahto, but Sorens son Hemant had already met him at an undisclosed location in Ranchi and taken his signature on a letter of support.        
	State Congress chief Pradeep Balmuchu, who had taken along all 14 of his MLAs to Mahtos home, waited for over two hours only to be told he had pledged support to Soren.

	Patna, Nov. 18 (PTI): Notwithstanding the denial of special category status to Bihar, the Centre has a substitute plan for the state to cope with development deficit, Planning Commission deputy chairman M.S. Ahluwalia said today.        
	Special state status cant be ensured for one state, as there are various technicalities involved. The chief minister (Nitish Kumar) has raised the demand, but the issue is the sole discretion of the National Development Council, which has laid down certain criteria for it, Ahluwalia told reporters here after meeting Nitish.        
	Noting that special state status only secured extra resources, Ahluwalia said: We have a special Bihar plan as a substitute which we want to enhance to cope with the development deficit, an issue raised by the chief minister.        
	The Planning Commission, he said, had no role in giving special status as it was accorded according to norms approved by the NDC, pointing out that some other states had made a similar demand. Bihar has made significant improvement all these years in almost all sectors and it needs extra resources for growth which we have recommended this year, Ahluwalia said.        
	We will also try to mobilise the central agencies for speeding up work under the Rajiv Gandhi Gramin Vidyutikaran Yojana and flood protection, he said, adding the commission had recommended extra resources for reaching critical help to the state.        
	About the states demand for special package for floods, Ahluwalia said he would discuss the issue after returning to Delhi. Long-term measure for flood protection is being discussed at the commission, which has just created a national mission, he added.        
	Nitish said the Planning Commission had recommended doubling the allocation of funds under the Shram Vikas Yojana from Rs 1,000 crore to Rs 2,000 crore this year.

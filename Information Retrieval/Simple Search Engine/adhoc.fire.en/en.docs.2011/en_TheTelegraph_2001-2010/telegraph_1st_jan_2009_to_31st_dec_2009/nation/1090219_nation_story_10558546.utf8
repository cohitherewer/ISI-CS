The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Death brings out rail toilet truth
                                                                                                               Death brings out rail toilet truth
          OUR BUREAU                                             
	Feb. 18: The death of a train driver who apparently got down from a Rajdhani to relieve himself has brought out of the closet an embarrassing inadequacy marring all 15,000 trains criss-crossing the country: none of their engines has toilets.        
	Loco pilot Cheniram Rajbongshi, the 44-year-old assistant driver of the 2424 Up Radhani Express, was hit by the Amritsar Express at Panbari railway station, 25km from Guwahati, when he got down to relieve himself at 7.15pm yesterday.        
	It is a real tragedy that a train driver was run over by another train just because he had to get down to answer natures call, the driver of the Amritsar Express, S. Sheikh, said. He was distraught at having lost a close friend whom he had met only three days ago.         
	We have often told our superiors about the need to have toilets inside the locomotive. They keep assuring us that such modified engines are on the way but we are yet to see them, he added.        
	Railway officials cite various reasons  plausible as well as conjectural  for not installing toilets in engines, ranging from lack of space to the possibility of drivers using the space to drink.         
	No toilet facility is available for engine drivers on board they relieve themselves at railway stations within the stipulated stoppage time, a senior official said .        
	The drivers either use the drinking water bottle to relieve themselves during the day or, in case of slow trains, stop the train after informing the station or signal officials, said Shiv Gopal, the general secretary of the All India Railwaymens Federation.        
	Asked what happens if a driver develops a stomach ailment during a trip, the official said: The person has to inform the next station where the train is scheduled to stop and if a replacement driver is available, charge may be handed over.        
	A driver said they sometimes stop the train just to answer natures call, after consulting the guard and the nearest control room with whom they are in touch over walkie-takie. It is a funny system. At times, we risk relieving ourselves by hanging out of running trains.         
	Mail and express trains have halts every one to two hours. However, super-fast trains like the Rajdhani stop only after about every four hours.        
	A railway doctor said a person could resist the pressure of natures call for about four to five hours, but the discomfort could be acute. Such inconvenience can lead to a lapse of concentration and can prove disastrous when it comes to driving superfast trains like the Rajdhani.                   Rajbongshi    
	However, the chief public relations officer at NF Railway headquarters in Maligaon, S. Hajong, said: The death looks like an act of carelessness on the part of the assistant pilot. The other train was coming from the opposite direction with its headlights on. It is difficult to miss such a big moving object. We will hold an internal inquiry.         
	Whatever was the cause of the tragedy, it has brought into focus the need for toilets in engines, a long-standing demand of the unions. But a toilet has not been incorporated in the design so far, although the facility is available in engines abroad.        
	Gopal said the issue was being considered by the Research Designs and Standards Organisation. We hope that such design needs are incorporated when new diesel and electric locomotives roll out. We hope design changes will be made to existing engines, too, he said.         
	At a time the railways are planning to run bullet trains at 300-350km per hour and set up dedicated freight corridor, we will have to incorporate toilets in engine design, an official said.        
	The main driver of the Dibrugarh-bound Rajdhani Express, Sadananda Bharali, who had also got down to relieve himself, recalled having told Rajbongshi to get inside quickly as the Amritsar Express had already been given the signal to enter the station.         
	I called again thinking that Maina (as Rajbongshi is fondly called by colleagues) did not hear me because of the sound of the running engine, but there was no answer, he said.        
	As Bharali peeped out of the door looking for Maina, he saw the body lying in the middle of two tracks.         
	Bharali said Rajbongshi had got down to relieve himself and to carry out an engine check. The Rajdhani had been stopped at Panbari for two reasons  to allow the Amritsar Express coming from the opposite direction to pass and conduct a cursory examination of the engine.         
	Railway sources said the gap between two sets of tracks  from midpoint of each  is 4.3 metres in old ones and 5.3 metres in new ones. Even if Rajbongshi was checking out the engine, there is no way the other train could have hit him. He may have chosen to relieve himself on the tracks over which the Amritsar Express passed, a source said.         
	Rajbongshi is survived by his widow Junu, daughter Malabika and son Nabakamal. He left for office on his bicycle after having a cup of tea with me. I never thought it would be the last cup of tea we would share together, Junu said.        
	Rajbongshi was cremated this evening.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | DMK reads telecom signal
                                                                                                               DMK reads telecom signal
          G.C. SHEKHAR                               
	Chennai, Oct. 24: The DMK today scaled down a planned protest against a Union minister following the past few days CBI raids on the offices of the telecom ministry, headed by party leader A. Raja.        
	Tamil Nadus ruling party has scheduled a protest rally at Madurai on November 1 that was initially targeted at Union environment minister Jairam Ramesh for his alleged pro-Kerala stand in a dam controversy.        
	Today, an announcement in the DMKs official organ, Murasoli, said the public meeting would be held to protest against the construction of a second dam by Kerala at Mullaiperiyar.        
	On Wednesday, after the Supreme Court had refused to stay a survey by Kerala for a new dam, the DMK had with great bravado announced the rally would condemn the manner in which a Union minister of state had dealt with the Mullaiperiyar issue. Jairams name was not mentioned but it was obvious that he was the target because he had cleared the Kerala survey in protected forest area.        
	Asked why the DMK had suddenly lowered the tenor of its protest, a senior state minister would only say: Probably there was some pressure from Delhi.        
	Asked if he meant the CBI raids on the telecom ministry offices, he merely said the raids may have been an indirect signal.        
	Although the DMK is unhappy about the raids ----- which came amid allegations of irregularities in the allocation of 2G spectrum and licences last year ----- its helpless because its government in Tamil Nadu needs Congress support to survive.        
	The DMK is now wooing back the Left parties and the PMK but cannot rely on them completely. The two Left parties and, especially, the PMK had proved temperamental in the past, forcing the DMK to roll back many policy decisions.        
	Since chief minister M. Karunanidhi is keen to see the World Tamil Conference in June 2010 go off without hitches, he does not want to rock the boat either in Delhi or Chennai.        
	Nor has the Tamil Nadu Congress found anything wrong with the DMK organising a rally to protest Jairams stand. Rather, it is happy to reaffirm that Tamil Nadus interests must not be compromised in any way.        
	There is nothing wrong in the DMKs protest at Madurai or the chief minister participating in it. Every party has its own approach. They are only asking for justice from the Centre, state Congress chief K.V. Thangkabaalu said today, unaware that Jairam was no longer the DMKs official target.              
	I have already written to the Prime Minister seeking his intervention, urging him to invite the two chief ministers for talks, Thangkabaalu said.

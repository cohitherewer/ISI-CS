The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Farm offer for varsity

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 24: Local Jat farmers have offered a part of their land, worth around Rs 10 crore, free to the Delhi government to help their children pursue higher education.        
	The 540 bighas should be used to open a new state university  as opposed to a central varsity  so their children can get the benefit of reservation, the farmers from a village in Najafgarh, Delhi, have told chief minister Sheila Dikshit.        
	Although Jats are included in Delhis Other Backward Classes list, they have been left out of the central OBC list. Since both Delhi University and Jawaharlal Nehru University are centrally run, Jats do not have a quota in either.        
	Delhi now has two state universities  the Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University and the Delhi Technical University  but both impart only technical education and not the general higher education in which the Jats are mainly interested.        
	A team of farmers from Ghumanhera village, led by the gram sabha head, met Dikshit yesterday and handed over the title deeds of the land. Their memorandum also demanded that the university be named after Rajiv Gandhi.        
	The farmers had last month met the Union human resource development minister, Kapil Sibal, with the demand for the state university.        
	Sibal, in a letter dated November 19, requested Dikshit to consider availing central assistance for setting up a new state university under the scheme for incentivising states during the 11th plan.        
	The letter, a copy of which is with The Telegraph, added: I empathise with the rationale put forward by the delegation. A possible solution seems to be that the government of NCT (National Capital Territory) of Delhi establishes a new state university where reservation policies of the state government and benefits to reservation based on the state list of OBCs could be availed by the Jat community and other communities which do not similarly find a place in the central list of OBCs.        
	Government sources said Dikshit was convinced by the idea and was looking into the technicalities. Perhaps its the farmers novel offer of land that won the two politicians over.        
	We are convinced that a new state university will come up soon. Our land will help educate our children; what more can we want? said Kishan Chand Solanki, president of the gram sabha.        
	In January 2009, farmers living near the Jalandhar bypass had given away land worth crores free to the government for developing the road.

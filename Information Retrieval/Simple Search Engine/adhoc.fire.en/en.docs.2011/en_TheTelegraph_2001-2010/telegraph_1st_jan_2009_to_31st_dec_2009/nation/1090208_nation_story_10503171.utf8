The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitish snub to Ayodhya call
                                                                                                               Nitish snub to Ayodhya call
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Feb. 7: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar today rejected Rajnath Singhs announcement that a Ram temple would be built in Ayodhya if the BJP came to power at the Centre.        
	Building the Ram temple has never been the agenda of the NDA. The NDA has nothing to do with the construction of the Ram temple, Kumar said, distancing himself from the BJPs stand ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.        
	At the BJP national council in Nagpur, Rajnath had said: We are waiting for the right opportunity. If we come to power, we will speed up the process. If the BJP gets majority on its own, we will make the temple by enacting a law in Parliament.        
	With his rejection, Kumar has indicated that he will keep himself away from any campaign to arouse the electorate over the Ram temple.        
	This is not for the first time Kumar has differed with the BJP. In 2007, he had distanced himself from L.K. Advanis stand on the uniform civil code.        
	While presenting his governments annual report card last December, Kumar had said the BJP and the Janata Dal (United) were different entities based on different political ideologies.         
	Why Kumar is distancing himself from the BJP is clear: he is safeguarding his minority votebank. He had won over the Muslims in Bihar by showing them he and his party were different from the BJP.

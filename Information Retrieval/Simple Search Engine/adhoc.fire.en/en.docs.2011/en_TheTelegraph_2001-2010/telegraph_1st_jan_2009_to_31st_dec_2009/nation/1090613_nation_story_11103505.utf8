	New Delhi, June 12: Mamata Banerjee today got Manmohan Singh to summon two top cabinet colleagues, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee and home minister P. Chidambaram, for a rare huddle on issues specific to Bengal.        
	The subjects discussed at the informal meeting included the possible harm to the environment by the proposed chemical hub at Nayachar, the need for development in Maoist-affected areas, and faster relief for the Aila-hit districts.        
	The meeting was called after Mamata told Singh that these were pressing issues that concerned the central government and that she would like to brief him about them.        
	Mamata had brought a note on the possible impact on the environment if a chemical hub was set up on Nayachar island off Haldia, said finance ministry officials privy to the hour-long talks. But they added no decisions were taken.        
	The previous Union cabinet had approved the chemical hub but the crucial clearance from the environment ministry is still to come. Experts have said the proposed hub will seriously disturb the environment.        
	The dumping of waste at the mouth of the Hooghly may endanger the livelihoods of around two lakh fishermen who live along the states coasts, they have said. Environmentalists also fear the Hooghlys waters would end up being used as a toxic shock absorber.        
	Mamata also stressed the need for development in the Maoist-affected areas of West Midnapore, Purulia and Bankura, saying mere police action would not yield results. She argued these areas needed a central package that would build infrastructure, provide healthcare and education, and improve farming.        
	Officials said Mamata also stressed the need to speed up cyclone aid. The railway minister and the Left Front government are engaged in a tussle over the availability  or lack  of relief and the way it should be disbursed.

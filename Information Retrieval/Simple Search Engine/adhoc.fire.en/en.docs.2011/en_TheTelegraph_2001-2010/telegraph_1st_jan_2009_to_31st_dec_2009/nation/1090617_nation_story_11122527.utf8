                                                                                                               Report confirms domestic help rape
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          Shiney    
	Mumbai, June 16: The final medical report of Shiney Ahujas domestic help has proved beyond doubt that it was rape, investigators said today as a team of forensic experts searched the arrested actors posh apartment for more clues.        
	 It was rape all right. The final medical report has proved it beyond doubt. The tear in the hymen, the injuries and marks of assault and other tests have confirmed it. We will push for maximum punishment as permitted by law. Celebrity or common man  the law is same for all, said assistant commissioner of police Dilip Suryavanshi.        
	The tests have also confirmed she was a virgin before the Sunday afternoon assault. A urine test will be conducted to check if the girl, now lodged in a government-run home, is pregnant.        
	Police sources said an X-ray of the girls bones had put her age between 17 and 18. That makes her a minor, said public prosecutor S. Kasture. But it will not have any legal implications because a statutory rape charge  when even consensual sex is rape  can only be slapped if the victim is younger than 16. But the fact that she is underage, will go against him (Shiney) in court.        
	Police are conducting more tests to find out the victims correct age. We are planning to send her for appropriate dental and bone examination, said deputy commissioner (Zone VI) Niket Kaushik.        
	The girls blood samples have been sent for tests to check if she was made to consume any drugs or alcohol.         
	Suryavanshi said they were also investigating the role of the victims boyfriend, who is alleged to have asked Shiney for a huge sum of money after the rape.        
	A forensic team searched Shineys apartment, which was later sealed by the police.

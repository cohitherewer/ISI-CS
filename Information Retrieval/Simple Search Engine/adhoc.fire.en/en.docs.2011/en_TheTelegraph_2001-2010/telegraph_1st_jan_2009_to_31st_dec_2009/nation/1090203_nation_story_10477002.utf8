          GAJINDER SINGH                          Chand: Fraud?                                  
	Chandigarh, Feb. 2: Former Haryana deputy chief minister Chander Mohans second wife today claimed she had received death threats, a day after he said he wanted to return to his first.        
	Nobody knows whether Fiza will be alive or not in the days ahead, Anuradha Bali, alias Fiza, said today, adding that she had been getting the threat messages on her mobile from close associates of my husbands relatives.        
	Fiza accused Mohan, alias Chand Mohammad, of fraud, blackmail and ditching her. The couple had married in November last year and Mohan had converted to Islam. He was sacked as deputy chief minister and she as assistant advocate-general after the marriage.        
	Today, Fiza suggested she had tied the knot because Mohan, former chief minister Bhajan Lals son, was desperate. I cant live without you, please marry me. What will happen if I die (without you)? Fiza read from a mobile message Mohan had purportedly sent her two years ago.        
	Fiza claimed Mohan had blackmailed her with suicide threats. He threatened to shoot himself if I did not marry him. This had been going on for three years. It is only now that I feel he was nothing but a cheat, she said.        
	Fiza said she felt betrayed by the way Mohan had left her and gone back to father Bhajan Lal and first wife Seema.         
	I dont even know whether he is Chander Mohan or Chand Mohammad now, she said and hinted at legal action. Mohan is believed to have come back to his fathers house in Panchkula but hasnt stepped out in public.        
	Asked whether she would press rape charges, Fiza said she couldnt say anything at the moment and denied reports that she had a CD with which she could blackmail Mohan.         
	I am not blackmailing him. I have lost everything in life. I will continue to practise Islam. I didnt convert just to marry him, she said, suggesting he might have done so.        
	Fiza, out on bail in a case of attempted suicide last week when she took an overdose of sleeping pills, said she didnt know what her (marital) status was now. He has not spoken to me since the day he left me.

	Bhubaneswar, June 20 (PTI): Expecting a heavy rush of pilgrims to Puri on the occasion of rath yatra of Lord Jagannath on June 24, East Coast Railway has taken steps to ensure safety and security of the passengers.        
	Security has been strengthened with the deployment of additional Railway Protection Force personnel at Puri, other important stations and on trains. Additional women staff would be deployed by the East Coast Railway for the security of female passengers.        
	A special squad for traffic control by GRP and special police personnel from the state, including the bomb detection squad, would be pressed into service to thwart untoward incidents. Sniffer dogs and metal detectors would also be used. East Coast Railway authorities are holding talks with other railway divisions for deputation of their personnel for the occasion as a precautionary measure.

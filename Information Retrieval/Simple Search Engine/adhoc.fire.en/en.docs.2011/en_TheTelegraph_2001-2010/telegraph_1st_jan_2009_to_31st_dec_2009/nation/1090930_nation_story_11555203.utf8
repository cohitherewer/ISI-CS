The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Medical school rating rift
                                                                                                               Medical school rating rift
  - Health ministry seeks   exemption from HRD        CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                          
	New Delhi, Sept. 29: The health ministry has demanded exemption for medical schools from a new higher education accreditation regime proposed by human resource development minister Kapil Sibal, setting the stage for a possible intra-cabinet confrontation.        
	Medical, dental, pharmacy and nursing institutions should be left out of the ambit of the proposed National Authority for Regulations in Accreditation of Higher Educational Institutions (NARAHEI), the health ministry has said.        
	In a letter to the HRD ministry, the health ministry has argued that it is setting up its own mechanism to rate institutions under its watch, government officials told The Telegraph.        
	The National Council for Human Resources in Health, a proposed overarching regulator for health education, will be empowered to appoint its own panel of experts to monitor accreditation of institutions related to health, the letter says.         
	The opposition to the NARAHEI regulating the quality rating of its institutions is now likely to be resolved only at a meeting of the Cabinet when Sibals proposed accreditation regime is discussed, the sources said.        
	If the health ministry proposal is accepted, India could have two parallel accreditation regimes  one for institutions under the HRD ministry and the other for institutions governed by the health ministry.        
	It may also defeat a key aim of Sibals proposal  to make accreditation independent of the agency regulating quality standards in that stream of education.        
	At present, the agency that grants recognition to higher education courses is also involved in subsequently rating the quality of the institution offering those courses.         
	The University Grants Commission, for instance, lays down the minimum quality standards for varsity education. The National Assessment and Accreditation Council, which rates universities, is autonomous on paper but legally not independent of the UGC.         
	The National Board of Accreditation that rates technical education institutions is a part of the All India Council of Technical Education that is responsible for setting standards in these streams of study.         
	The Medical Council of India similarly both regulates standards, and rates institutions offering courses related to medical, dental, pharmaceutical and nursing education.         
	This duplicity of roles leads to potential conflict of interest scenarios as poor quality rating during accreditation would be tantamount to suggesting that the agency erred in recognising the institutes degrees, critics have argued. It also breeds corruption, several academicians have alleged.         
	Both the National Knowledge Commission and the Yash Pal panel on higher education proposed making the accreditation process independent of the regulator responsible for laying down quality norms.        
	Under the UPAs proposed reforms in higher education, a National Commission for Higher Education and Research will act as an overarching regulator of all education barring medical and agricultural education.         
	The proposed council for human resources in health will play the role of overarching regulator for health-related subjects.         
	But the government had planned a single accreditation watchdog  the NARAHEI  to regulate rating agencies independent of the government, which will be allowed to rate institutions.        
	The NARAHEI, under the proposed bill to create this authority, is envisaged as an accreditation regulator independent of both the NCHER and the proposed overarching health education regulator.         
	As quality norms may vary between different streams of education, the NCHER and the council for human resources in health would be allowed to set independent quality standards, under the proposed NARAHEI Bill.        
	But the health ministry letter suggests that it wants the proposed council for health education to also govern accreditation in medical education.

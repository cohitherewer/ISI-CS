	Chennai, March 26: The PMK today switched sides for the fifth time in 11 years, deciding to throw in its lot with the ADMK but keeping the door to the Congress open.         
	Since 1998, whoever the PMK has allied with, that front has formed the government at the Centre. This time too it will be no different. Our main reason to leave the UPA in Tamil Nadu is due to the shabby manner in which our leaders and cadres had been treated by the DMK and its ministers, PMK founder S. Ramadoss said at the party general council meeting.        
	The announcement of the decision to fight the elections with the ADMK, dumping the DMK-led alliance of which it was a part in 2004, was expected. However, the PMK was careful not to burn its bridges with the Congress.        
	Anbumani Ramadoss, Union minister and son of the PMK chief, said his party had excellent relations with Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.         
	I will be meeting them in the next two days to submit my resignation but I will fail if I do not thank them for giving me the opportunity to serve the country in my own small way, Anbumani told the audience, gathered at a marriage hall in a Chennai suburb.         
	This makes it clear the party will focus its attack on the DMK, leaving the Congress out of its line of fire and keeping open the option of joining a Congress-led government at the Centre again after May 16.         
	The Congress had played intermediary to mend relations between the PMK and the DMK but Ramadoss Senior told Congress leaders the alliance would not work at the ground level given the animosity between the cadres of the two parties, especially after the DMK had expelled the PMK from the front in June 2008. The PMK had continued as part of the UPA in Delhi even after the break in Tamil Nadu.        
	Today, 2,453 general council members voted for an alliance with the ADMK whereas only 117 preferred the DMK. The ballot was a formality since Ramadoss had already sealed the deal with Jayalalithaa, but it sent out the signal that the falling-out with the DMK was near-total.         
	The ADMK-led front now has four erstwhile allies of the DMK on its side, giving it a clear psychological edge. The PMKs strong base in north Tamil Nadu will complement the ADMKs advantage in south and west Tamil Nadu.         
	With one more ally deserting it, the Congress is still hoping to get Vijayakanths DMDK on its side though the actor-politician showed no signs of being willing to join either of the two fronts.         
	At Kanyakumari, he announced candidates for nine seats, including some held by the Congress, and said he did not start his party to beg for a few seats in an alliance. My alliance is with God and the people, he declared.

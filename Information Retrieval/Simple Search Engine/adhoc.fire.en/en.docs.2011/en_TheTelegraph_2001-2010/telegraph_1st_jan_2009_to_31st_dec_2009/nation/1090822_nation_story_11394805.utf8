The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lack of death data cripples flu fight
                                                                                                               Lack of death data cripples flu fight
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 21: Gaps in the medical details of Indias pandemic flu fatalities are hampering Indias capacity to develop more effective responses to the expanding infection, medical experts have warned.         
	At least 48 people infected with the pandemic H1N1 virus have died in six states across India over the past two weeks, but key questions about their illness patterns and the circumstances of their deaths remain unanswered.         
	Indias director-general of health services Rakesh Srivastava said last week most of the deaths appeared to involve patients who approached government hospitals for treatment several days after the onset of symptoms, linking the deaths to delays.         
	But public health and infectious disease specialists say detailed investigations into the medical histories of the patients who have died may generate information that could be used to more efficiently identify patients faster at high risk of severe disease.         
	We need answers to many questions, said Jacob John, former head of virology at the Christian Medical College, Vellore. What is the case fatality rate in India  how many have died and how many have been infected? Did the people who died have underlying health conditions? What were the causes of their deaths? Did they die despite having received the anti-viral drug?         
	Central government health officials have said they are collecting case details from states and an analysis is under way. But doctors say the information needs to be in the public domain  for use by government as well as private doctors.         
	We need to know what went wrong in these patients  the faster we get such data, the better we handle future cases, said Randeep Guleria, professor of medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. The investigations should examine the age distribution of patients in the Indian context, the nutritional status of patients, and whether they were immuno-compromised, he said.         
	Indias National Institute of Communicable Disease (NICD) in New Delhi is tasked with analysing outbreaks. But the absence of periodic mortality information and analysis from the NICD contrasts sharply with the weekly mortality and morbidity reports issued by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for medical practitioners worldwide.         
	We urgently need a similar mortality analysis report in India  at least during this pandemic, said Manish Kakkar, an infectious disease specialist at the Public Health Foundation of India.         
	A report from the US CDC last month had described 10 patients with severe H1N1 disease at a health centre in Michigan, and revealed a strikingly high prevalence of obesity among the patients.         
	 You need to analyse cumulative deaths deaths to reduce the risk of future deaths, said Kakkar . quot;What you find may allow you to modify treatment guidelines and manage cases better. quot;         
	Virologist John said in influenza it is important to distinguish whether the deaths are because of viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial infections. Influenza specialists said there are two kinds of flu deaths  those that can be prevented and those that cannot be prevented.

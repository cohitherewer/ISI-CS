          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Bhubaneswar students offer ribbons to mark International Day of Persons with Disabilities. (Sanjib Mukherjee)                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 3: Sevayats of Puris Jagannath temple today expressed their willingness to allow disabled devotees to enter the temple.         
	The nod from sevayats coincided with International Day of Persons with Disabilities celebrations on Thursday and the news was welcomed by thousands of activists and physically challenged pilgrims who had been campaigning for the cause.        
	Objections from the sevayats had been the biggest hurdle so far for the temple administration. Three sevayats from the Puri temple addressed the gathering of activists and disabled and communicated their consent. We have no objection to the entry of physically disabled persons, said Ipsit Pratihari, one of the sevayats who attended the meeting here.        
	The sevayats have welcomed suggestions regarding the entry of disabled devotees inside the temple and appealed to the government to make necessary arrangements, said Shruti Mahapatara, who is leading the campaign.        
	The temple can very soon become disabled-friendly, she said.        
	The activists have been campaigning to allow wheel chair-bound devotees inside the premises. Rights forums have also demanded ramps in the shrine. The campaign began on September 13 and since then there have been several rounds of consultation with the Puri sevayats.        
	The 12th century Puri shrine has a strict entry code. The entry of non-Hindus or people wearing leather is strictly prohibited. Similarly, a disabled person cannot go into the temple on a wheelchair, as there is strict restriction on the movement of wheels inside the shrine.         
	The temple authorities do allow entry to disabled, old and paralysed people with the help of family members and temple servitors. Normally they are carried by relatives or carried on stretchers.        
	I would not like to be carried by male servitors. The matter is not about putting in place some arrangements. Its about a womans dignity, said Mahapatara.         
	Although the sevayats expressed their willingness to allow entry of disabled persons into the temple, they had no clear views on allowing wheelchairs. As such, the final decision on allowing wheelchairs lies with the temple administration.         
	Even if the administration agrees to the proposal, the arrangement might bear little fruit as the temple has a steep flight of stairs.

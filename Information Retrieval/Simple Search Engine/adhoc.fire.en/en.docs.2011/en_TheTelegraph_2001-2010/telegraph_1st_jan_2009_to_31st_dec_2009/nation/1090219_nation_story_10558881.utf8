	The prize was established in 1987 as recognition that the outstanding literary talent that exists in more than 50 Commonwealth countries is making a significant contribution to contemporary writing in English.        
	The prize is to encourage and reward the upsurge of new Commonwealth fiction and ensure that works of merit reach a wider audience outside their country of origin.         
	For the Best Book award, the following have been shortlisted: Chris Cleaves The Other Hand (Sceptre UK), Shashi Deshpandes The Country of Deceit (Penguin India), Philip Henshers The Northern Clemency (Fourth Estate UK), Jhumpa Lahiris Unaccustomed Earth (Bloomsbury Publishing UK), David Lodges Deaf Sentence (Hartville Secker UK) and Salman Rushdies The Enchantress of Florence (Random House UK).        
	There is a separate shortlist and a 5,000 prize for the Best First Book. Those nominated are: Sulaiman Addonia for The Consequences of Love (Chatto amp; Windus UK), Daniel Clay for Broken (HarperCollins UK), Joe Dunthorne for Submarine (Random House UK), Mohammed Hanif for A Case of Exploding Mangoes (Vintage Pakistan) and Murzaban F. Shroff for Breathless in Bombay (St. Martins Griffin India).        
	There are also winners for Best Book and Best First Book from four regions  Africa; Canada and the Caribbean; Europe and South Asia; and South East Asia and the South Pacific. This is because the prize, now in its 23rd year, is aimed at celebrating cutting-edge fiction across the four regions of the Commonwealth.        
	The regional winners will be announced on March 11 and the overall winners on May 16.        
	The prizes are organised by the Commonwealth Foundation with the support of the Macquarie Group Foundation, one of Australias leading philanthropic organisations.        
	Professor Makarand Paranjape, from India, who judged the Europe and South Asia region with Durre Sameen Ahmed from Pakistan and Alex Tickell from the UK, said: What distinguished this years entries was a preponderance of well-established authors, including Salman Rushdie, Philip Hensher, Shashi Deshpande and Jhumpa Lahiri in the Best Book category and some very talented new voices such as Mohammed Hanif and Joe Dunthorne in the Best First Book category.        
	Though most of the short-listed authors either live in the UK or are British subjects, they are actually quite diverse in their origins.        
	The 2008 overall winners were The Book of Negroes by Lawrence Hill for Best Book while Tahmima Anams A Golden Age was chosen as Best First Book.

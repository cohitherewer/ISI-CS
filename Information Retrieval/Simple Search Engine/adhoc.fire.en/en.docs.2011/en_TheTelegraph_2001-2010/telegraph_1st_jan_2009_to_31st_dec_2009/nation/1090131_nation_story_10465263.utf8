          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           More options?                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 30: Sections of the government are looking at the option of introducing an ordinance to start implementing the Prime Ministers promise of 14 world-class universities.        
	If the Centre does bring an ordinance, it will be the second such use of temporary powers in quick succession to launch new universities.         
	President Pratibha Patil had earlier this month signed the Central Universities Ordinance, 2008, to start 15 central universities.        
	The University Grants Commission has finalised a bill on the world-class universities and will present it to the HRD ministry on February 1, government officials said.         
	But the government is likely to run short of time to introduce the bill in Parliament, even if the ministry accepts the draft drawn up by the UGC without delay.        
	Parliament meets on February 12 for its final session before the general elections. Any bill needs to be listed in advance for it to be tabled.        
	Once the UGC and the ministry agree on a draft bill, it will have to be scrutinised by the governments expenditure finance committee (EFC) for budgetary implications.         
	If the EFC clears the draft without recommending changes, the bill goes to the Cabinet, which must approve it before it is tabled in Parliament.        
	But the cabinet, which meets once a week, is likely to hold only two more meetings at best before the Parliament session.        
	The world-class universities were announced by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in his 2007 Independence Day speech, and the promise, if unfulfilled, may prove embarrassing.         
	The Congress-led UPA government has acted on most of its major education-related promises.        
	It appears that the only way we can implement the promise of the world-class universities is through an ordinance, a government official said.         
	He added, however, that the ordinance option was still at an initial stage.        
	The universities are called National Universities in the UGC draft. The bill specifies how these universities, to be started from scratch, are to attain the standards of the best institutions in the developed world.         
	On January 15, the President approved an Ordinance prepared by the ministry to start 15 more central universities  different from the world-class universities.         
	The presidential approval came even as the National Knowledge Commission opposed the draft ordinance, alleging that it perpetuated errors in the higher education system.         
	The commission had also expressed reservations about an earlier draft on the world-class universities, saying it allowed the government to interfere too much in management of varsities.

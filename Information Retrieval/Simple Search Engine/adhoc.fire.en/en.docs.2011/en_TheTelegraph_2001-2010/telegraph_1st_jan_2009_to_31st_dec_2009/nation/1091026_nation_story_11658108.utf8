The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Karat tiptoes on OC deal
                                                                                                               Karat tiptoes on OC deal
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Oct. 25: Prakash Karat today steered clear of Bengals deal to free a police officer taken hostage by Maoists, saying the decision was based on the judgement of the state government.        
	The state government is carrying out joint operations to isolate the (Maoists) in Lalgarh and other areas. The government exercised its judgement and decided to get them (the 14 women) released. We have nothing more to say on this, the CPM general secretary told a news conference.         
	Karat appeared to suggest that the state governments decision not to oppose the bail of the 14 women was entirely a matter decided by the administration, with no role for the party.        
	However, the CPM leader pointed out that the women released were not important (Maoist) cadres but ordinary people mobilised by the rebels.         
	Karat asserted that the centrally banned CPI (Maoist) wasnt part of the communists fold and said the party would launch a campaign to isolate the rebels. We do not consider Maoists a Left organisation. They have killed over 60 of our people (from the CPM) in Bengal.        
	In keeping with Karats tone, a statement issued by the central committee today condemned the extremist Maoist gangs but was silent on the hostage deal.        
	There were no differences in the party as the state government and the party handled the situation as best as possible, a committee member said.         
	However, the party was keen to scotch speculation that the hostage deal would set a precedent  the reason chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee asserted yesterday that it was an exception, not the norm.         
	Bhattacharjee was told to rule out the possibility of it (the swap) turning into a precedent, the member said.        
	Sources said the central committee did not discuss or decide the partys stand on the multi-state security offensive being planned against the Maoists, although Bhattacharjee had vowed yesterday to teach the rebels a lesson.

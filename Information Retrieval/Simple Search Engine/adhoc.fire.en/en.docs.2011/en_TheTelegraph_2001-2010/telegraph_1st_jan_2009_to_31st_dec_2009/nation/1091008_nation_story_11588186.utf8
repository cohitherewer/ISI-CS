The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Slain cop unpaid since March
                                                                                                               Slain cop unpaid since March
          RAJ KUMAR                          Indwar                                  
	Ranchi, Oct. 7: Dead, Maoist victim Francis Indwar is attracting lakhs in compensation. Alive, the officer wasnt paid for the past seven months.        
	Soon after the special branch inspectors beheaded body was found yesterday, the state announced ex gratia of Rs 10 lakh and insurance of Rs 11.5 lakh for his family, plus the 50-year-olds basic salary and allowances for the remaining years of his service.        
	Indwar, however, hadnt been able to draw his monthly salary of Rs 32,000 since March because of red tape. He had been transferred from Bokaro to Ranchi in March, but his last pay certificate (LPC), which would have allowed him to draw his salary at his new posting, was never issued.        
	This came to light when Jharkhand Police Association (Special Branch) secretary G.P. Sharma made a fervent appeal to Bokaro superintendent of police Saket Kumar Singh this morning, urging him to clear Indwars LPC. The appeal came as preparations for Indwars funeral were on at the St Francis Church in Harmu.        
	Confronted with questions, a hesitant Sharma, sensing the gravity of the situation, said it was a procedural delay that is quite common in the police department.        
	There is no ill intention behind it, Sharma told reporters. Issuance of an LPC needs clearance from the armoury, which issues firearms and ammunition to a police officer. A clearance is also sought from the office of the circle inspector and several other wings of the district police department. Finally, the clearance certificates reach the accounts department that issues the LPC. The entire process takes time.        
	The armoury part is ironical. Indwar used to carry weapons in Bokaro, but once he was promoted and transferred to the special branch in Ranchi, he was denied any arms on his dangerous intelligence-gathering missions. The reason: the weapons may fall into Maoist hands in case he is captured.        
	The Bokaro SP, who assumed office today, said he had sent Indwars LPC and that it would reach Ranchi by tomorrow.         
	A special branch officer said using the existing force effectively was a big challenge for the department.         
	The men are demoralised because they do not receive support from their seniors. Special branch officers are neither provided with allowance nor a safe place to stay when they venture into remote areas, he said.        
	State police spokesperson S.N. Pradhan said the secret service funds were provided through district superintendents.        
	Any special branch officer can get the money on demand. As far as the problem of accommodation is concerned, I admit there are lapses. Jharkhand is yet to follow in the footsteps of other states that make special provisions for intelligence-gathering in remote pockets, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Left gives up panel claim
                                                                                                               Left gives up panel claim
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              Yechury, Mamata				                                 
	New Delhi, July 13: The Left Front has agreed to give up its claim to head the parliamentary standing committee on railways to avoid what a senior member called tu, tu, main main (running spats) with rail minister Mamata Banerjee.        
	The Left is also not likely to head any of the other infrastructure-related panels.        
	Left sources said they wanted either coal and steel or energy in lieu of giving up the railway committee that it virtually regards as its natural right. Barring a break in 2000 when Mamata was the minister, a CPM legislator has always chaired the panel.        
	The chairmanship and membership of the 17 ministry-related House panels are in proportion to a partys numbers in Parliament. After their diminished strength, the CPM and its allies are entitled to chair one each in the Rajya Sabha and the Lok Sabha.        
	In the last government, Rajya Sabha MP Sitaram Yechury had headed the committee on transport, tourism and culture that was heavy on infrastructure because it included shipping, civil aviation and surface transport (urban and rural roads and national highways).        
	Left sources said the CPM would like to keep the position. But government sources said they were disinclined to let the Left have anything to do with infrastructure as the government had decided to fast-track reforms in the sector.        
	Government sources who are speaking to the Left MPs claimed they were willing to settle for the panels on rural development and science and technology and environment and forests.

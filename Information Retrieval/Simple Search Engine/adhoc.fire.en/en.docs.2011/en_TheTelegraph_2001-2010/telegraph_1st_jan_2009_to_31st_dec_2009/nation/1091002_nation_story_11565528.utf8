The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | VIP squatters annoy court
                                                                                                               VIP squatters annoy court
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 1: The Supreme Court today frowned on the delay in evicting officials and politicians who overstay in government flats and bungalows.        
	Even cabinet ministers are not getting houses now. First they stay in five-star hotels, now they stay in bhavans, it observed, alluding to foreign minister S.M. Krishna and his deputy Shashi Tharoor, who recently faced an austerity whip from their party.        
	The ministers are not staying at bhavans (state government guesthouses) but at the guesthouses of the Foreign Service Institute and the Indian Navy, but the observation triggered laughter in the courtroom.        
	The two-judge bench, hearing a plea against squatters, was reacting to a statement that even the solicitor-general hadnt been allotted appropriate accommodation.        
	The problem is, the court said, the eviction law doesnt cover those legally allotted accomodation but staying on illegally. The Centre has been resisting the courts prod to change the law, making overstaying a non-bailable offence, and to prosecute squatters.        
	The bench recalled instances of low-level judicial officers and even the odd high court judge overstaying in their official residences.

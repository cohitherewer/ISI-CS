          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 19: The 11-day symbolic Assembly session, run by the Opposition in protest against abrupt adjournment, concluded today with the adoption of a censure motion against the Naveen Patnaik government.        
	The combined Opposition ran the House for the rest of the days after the winter session was adjourned sine die abruptly on December 5 with 11 working days left. The winter session was scheduled to conclude on December 19.        
	Peeved about the abrupt adjournment of the session, the Opposition members had marched to Raj Bhavan on December 6 and urged the governor to reconvene the session for rest of the days.        
	However, the Opposition members, who had been staying put in the House round the clock since December 5 evening in protest against the undemocratic and unconstitutional act of the government, held a symbolic session till today, pending decision of the governor.        
	Governor M.C. Bhandare, on a visit to New Delhi at present, has neither prorogued nor resummoned the Assembly session as yet.        
	Addressing the media after conclusion of the session this afternoon, Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh said a censure motion was adopted against the BJD government, which had failed on all fronts. We will go to the people with the demand for Naveens resignation, said Singh.        
	Describing the symbolic session as unprecedented, Opposition chief whip Prasad Harichandan said it was a warning to the government not to repeat violation of the Constitution, rules of Assembly and democratic norms.        
	The Opposition chief whip claimed that several issues and serious allegations against the government were discussed in shape of 11 adjournment motions, five motions, 10 special mention, three calling attention notices and 89 questions during the symbolic session. We will compile the proceedings in the shape of a booklet and distribute it among people, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rush for slice of Liverpool
                                                                                                               Rush for slice of Liverpool
          AMIT ROY                          Rao                                  
	London, April 26: The Indian businessman, Grandhi Mallikarjun Rao, whose GMR infrastructural group runs the Delhi Daredevils in the IPL, is said to be interested in taking a stake in Liverpool, one of the top football clubs in the world, it was claimed today.        
	Under an exclusive tag, the News of the World said Liverpool have held talks with the billionaire owners of an Indian Premier League cricket team. And that could lead to a massive investment and an eventual buy-out.        
	The Sunday Express also ran a similar story today, under an exclusive tag as well, headlined, Liverpool go for an Indian  an expression normally used for an evening out enjoying a curry.        
	There isnt much evidence yet to back up either story other than circumstantial evidence. However, Liverpool do want funds in order to buy top players.        
	A representative of the Bangalore-based GMR group apparently has been to the Premier League clubs home ground at Anfield to see a game against Arsenal and hold discussions with the Liverpools American co-owners, Tom Hicks and George Gillett.        
	Liverpool are talking to other possible buyers as well. Among them, according to the Sunday Express, is one of Kuwaits richest families.        
	It is understood that Nasser Al Kharafi, worth 9 billion, is considering a bid, the Sunday Express said. Also looking on is Liverpool fan Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum of the Dubai ruling family.        
	The paper said Hicks and Gillett want to sell for around 450 million or alternatively invite huge investment to back Liverpools re-emergence as a title force.        
	Both Hicks and Gillett were on Merseyside last week, taking in the 4-4 draw with Arsenal after having talks over refinancing the 350m loan which enabled them to buy the club.         
	Leading members of the GMR, owned by Rao, were wined and dined by Hicks and Gillett, the report said.        
	Talks were started by Hicks, initially with a view to securing a sponsorship deal, but Bangalore-based GMR have made no secret of their desire to branch out into other sports.         
	Rao, 58, made his millions in the airport and construction industry and recently formed a subsidiary company to invest in sport, with English football considered the most attractive.        
	The News of the World speculated that Rao is worth an estimated 4.2 billion.        
	Liverpools American owners have been scouring the globe for finance to stave off the threat of having to sell the club on the cheap in July, it claimed.        
	The GMR group were invited by Hicks and their representative watched the Arsenal match in the directors box with Hicks son Tommy, a source told the News of the World. It was quite clear the representative was a fan.        
	The source added: When you look at the companys commitment to sport, theyre exactly the type of partner Tom would be looking for.        
	Liverpool, founded in 1892 and now captained by Steven Gerrard, say they have maintained their status as a domestic and European force since the Premier League began in 1992, rarely finishing outside the top positions. The club have won seven major trophies since then, including the Champions League, Uefa Cup, two FA Cups and three League Cups.         
	Indeed, 2001 saw the Reds claim an unprecedented League Cup, FA Cup and Uefa Cup treble. Having won more domestic and European trophies than any other English club, Liverpools status as giants of the domestic game is undisputed.        
	The possible sale of Liverpool to an Indian owner has provoked the clubs fans to take to the Internet chat rooms. Go on bring on the Indians, was one comment. They will run the club rights (sic). Plus they will provide the right funds for (Rafa) Benitez (the Spanish manager). Also could be fantastic commercially with the whole of 1 billion india (sic) walking around in liverpool shirts.        
	Not everyone is happy, though. Another fan protested: As a Liverpool supporter, I do find it embarassing (sic) to be continually linked to anybody with a little bit of spare cash.

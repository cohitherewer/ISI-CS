          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 10: India must convert its district teacher training nerve-centres into colleges offering degrees to meet a severe shortage of qualified school teachers, under a dramatic overhaul recommended by the countrys apex educational research agency.        
	District Institutes of Educational Training established over the past two decades to offer working teachers additional training, must start offering teacher education degree courses, the National Council for Educational Research and Training has said.        
	The proposal is one among a slew of reforms in teacher education proposed by the NCERT under the direction of human resource development minister Kapil Sibal to transform teacher education, an often neglected field of education.        
	The reform roadmap for teacher education prepared by the NCERT is a part of Sibals 100-day agenda.        
	India faces a shortage of around 2 lakh teachers in just primary education under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, aimed at universalising education till class V.         
	Earlier this year, the country started the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan, aimed at replicating the SSA in secondary education.        
	But the quality of school teachers in many schools  rural and urban  has been frequently criticised by surveys and studies, and Sibal himself today referred to those concerns.        
	The idea is not just to fill vacancies (in teaching posts) but to ensure quality too, the HRD minister said, asked about teacher shortages at a media briefing.        
	The NCERT roadmap suggests that the government, in the first phase, upgrades 10-12 per cent of DIETs into degree colleges. India has 571 DIETs at present.        
	The upgraded DIETs must offer Diplomas in Education (DEd) and Bachelors in Education (BEd) courses  each of two-year duration  currently offered only by universities and their colleges.        
	The NCERT has suggested that BEd. students be offered a stipend between Rs 5,000 and Rs 6,000 a month for the duration of a nine-month inter-shop that is a part of their course.        
	These upgraded DIETs must also link up with universities to offer four-year undergraduate programmes in elementary and secondary education, modelled on Delhi Universitys Bachelors in Elementary Education (BElEd) course.        
	The country at present has five Regional Institutes of Education  NCERT outposts in Mysore, Bhubaneswar, Bhopal, Ajmer and Shillong  that help states in their region frame school curricula and textbooks.         
	But these RIEs are overworked and unable to survive the burden from states seeking their assistance, the NCERT has said.        
	It has recommended that at least four more RIEs be set up during the XIth Five Year Plan (2007-2012) and an additional five over the subsequent five years.        
	The NCERT roadmap has also advised that the Centre provide a majority of the funding required for Indias teacher education programmes.        
	At present, the Centre and states share equally the financial burden of educating and training school teachers.        
	The NCERT has suggested that the Centre and states provide funds in a 75:25 ratio with the Centre specially bearing 90 per cent of the expenditure in northeastern states.        
	The roadmap follows an NCERT survey that revealed that most DIETs have inadequate infrastructure  often lacking staff rooms, and even toilets for students.        
	Two in every three DIETs in eastern India have vacancies in more than 50 per cent of their sanctioned teaching posts.

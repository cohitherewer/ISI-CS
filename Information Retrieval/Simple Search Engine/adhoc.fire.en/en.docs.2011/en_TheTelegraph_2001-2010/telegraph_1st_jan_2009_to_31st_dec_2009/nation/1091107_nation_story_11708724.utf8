          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Cuttacks Balijatra on Friday. (Badrika Nath Das)                                  
	Cuttack, Nov. 6: Rural crafts from across the country are becoming the chief attraction at Cuttacks Balijatra-2009, the single largest gathering in the state after Puris rath yatra.        
	The fair held on the banks of the Mahanadi, which began on Tuesday and will get over on Sunday, has drawn 300-odd artisans and self-help groups from as many as 28 states.         
	Gandhi Shilp Bazaar, organised jointly by Cuttack Chapter of Orissa Rural Development and Marketing Society (Ormas) and Cuttack administration, is the largest participant that has put up 310 of the 1,300 pavilions and kiosks at the fair.        
	Artisans love it here as it helps popularise ethnic and rural craft and creates opportunities for them to build long-term marketing tie-ups with prospective buyers, said Kishore Kumar Mohanty, the Cuttack collector.         
	With some 3-lakh people thronging everyday, major goods on display include chanderi saris and brass metal products from Madhya Pradesh, woollen items from Kashmir, leather products from Rajasthan, wooden items from Andhra Pradesh, cane and bamboo craft from Tripura and Meghalaya. According to Ormas, the Gandhi Shilp Bazaar, sponsored by central development commissioner of handicrafts in the ministry of textile, facilitates future marketing prospects by providing a platform to swarojagaries, buyer-seller meets and a forum for technology transfer.         
	Besides, producers get the feedback from the final consumers directly and are able to know the market trends and preferences, said Bipin Rout, the chief executive of Ormas (Cuttack chapter).         
	Participating agencies also include Khadi and Village Industries Corporation, Nabard, Union textile ministry, Mission Shakti and Rural Development Agencies of Orissa.         
	Ormas had come up with handloom, terracotta and knotted carpet demonstrations for dissemination of technology. Seminars and workshops on micro-credit linkages, marketing and packaging of rural products are also being organised as part of Gandhi Silpa Bazaar.

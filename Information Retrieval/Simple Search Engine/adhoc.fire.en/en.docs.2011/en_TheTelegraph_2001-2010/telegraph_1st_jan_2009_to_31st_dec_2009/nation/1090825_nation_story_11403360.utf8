          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 24: At least 24 tribals have died of diarrhoea in Kalahandi district over the past fortnight, collector R.S. Gopalan confirmed.        
	The disease has been spreading from the first week of August, claming lives under three gram panchayats in Bhawanipatna and six in Lanjigarh block.         
	While the situation in Lanjigarh has been brought under total control, it is still alarming at Bhawanipatna, said the collector.         
	Despite the presence of tubewells, the tribals continue using polluted water from ponds and streams, Gopalan said.        
	While 13 persons have died in five tribal villages under Bhawanipatna block, four hamlets under Lanjigarh block accounted for 11 deaths.         
	In Bhawanipatna block, six deaths were reported from Panchbaheli, three from Jamchuan, two from Tengnabaheli and one each from Rukunibundel and Bundelguda. Affected villages under Lanjigarh block are Ghatikundra (6), Tarangsel (3) and Talbora and Jalkrida (1 each).        
	As many as 177 cases have already been treated and 63 patients are still in hospital. The district administration is paying an incentive of Rs 200 for those getting admitted to hospitals.         
	The ongoing Nuakhai festival in this region has made many patients reluctant to do so.         
	While five medical teams have been deputed at Lanjigarh, five more have been camping at Bhawanipatna. We are planning to depute 20 more teams to different areas. Ten teams are being brought from Balangir, said Gopalan.

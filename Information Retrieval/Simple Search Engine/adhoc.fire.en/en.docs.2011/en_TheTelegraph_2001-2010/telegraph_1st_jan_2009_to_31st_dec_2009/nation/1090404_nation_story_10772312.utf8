The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pawar pleases all with snag

  - NCP chief skips rally but phones in speech, Lalu fights front amp; BJP      OUR BUREAU                          Pawar: No room for complaint                                        
	April 3: A snag kept NCP boss Sharad Pawar from making his much awaited  and much apprehended  appearance at a BJD-led and avowedly anti-Congress rally in Bhubaneswar today. The jury is out on whether the snag was technical or political, but the wily warhorse succeeded in keeping both camps happy and hooked.         
	The Congress appeared pleased that Pawar, a Union minister and key UPA constituent, had robbed Naveen Patnaik, Prakash Karat and company of a huge propaganda takeaway  the Maharashtra strongman was at least not on prime-time television making common cause with leaders of a rival alliance. Patnaik and Karat, on the other hand, were handed the benefit of making a fig-leaf claim  Pawar arrived aurally, speaking to the gathering long-distance on a mobile handset held proudly against the dais microphones.         
	Later in the evening, Pawar himself equivocated with elan at a news conference to release the NCP manifesto in Mumbai. We are part of the UPA and not of either the Left Front or the third front, but if the UPA does not get enough seats to form a government on its own, we will suggest to the UPA that the help of secular parties should be taken in forming a government.         
	Was he up for prime ministership, then? The UPA will meet after the polls to decide a leader and I am confident that the decision will be a unanimous decision.         
	Did he agree with Manmohan Singhs projection as Prime Minister by the Congress? My party had passed a resolution to project Manmohan Singh as the UPAs prime ministerial candidate, but Sonia Gandhi decided to name him as the Congress partys prime ministerial candidate, and she has every right to do so.         
	In deed and in word today, Pawar played the textbook politician, mixing plainspeak with cleverspeak in a manner that gave the Congress no handle to cry betrayal and its secular adversaries no reason to doubt hell play ball in case parties of the third front have a real chance on the field.         
	The Bhubaneswar show was not strictly a third front affair  it was focused on Orissa alone  but nobody doubted it was a stridently anti-Congress platform, and one in a series of events aimed at building a non-Congress, non-BJP alternative. Pawars NCP is only a minor ally of the BJD in the state, but the message of his presence on the podium would have rippled far beyond the confines of the state.         
	The Congress, for one, appeared relieved that wasnt the case. The fact is, he (Pawar) didnt go to attend that rally, Congress spokesperson Kapil Sibal said with a touch of victory this afternoon. He has said he is with the UPA, he has never said he is in the race for prime ministership. That makes things clear enough.         
	Pawars own partymen, though, werent so convinced their leader had foreclosed any options. Pawar himself has said a lot will depend on how many seats the UPA eventually gets; everybody knows things are uncertain and even smaller parties can become very important.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong behind PM on Pak
                                                                                                               Cong behind PM on Pak
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Sonia                                  
	New Delhi, July 27: The Congress has showed signs of rallying around Manmohan Singh on the controversial Indo-Pak joint statement, two days before he comes out with a clarification in Parliament.        
	Signs of that came today from chief spokesperson Janardhan Dwivedi, who asserted that Singh would set to rest all apprehensions and speculation on the Sharm-al-Sheikh statement, issued after talks with Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani, on July 29.        
	The Prime Minister is also expected to address concerns on the end-user (arms inspection) pact reached during US secretary of state Hillary Clintons recent visit. Nuclear enrichment and reprocessing rights, discussed at the G-8 summit in Italy this month, could also figure in his speech. But these may be overshadowed by his interjections on the Pakistan statement, which got the political establishment, including the Congress, worried.         
	Sonia Gandhi will articulate her position at the Congress Parliamentary Party meeting on July 30 but is believed to have signalled to party leaders to start supporting the Prime Minister.        
	Over the past week, whenever Singh has met a Congress MP for reasons other than politics, it is believed he didnt pass up the chance to explain his viewpoint on the statement.         
	During those meetings, the Prime Minister was said to have maintained that Delhi had not conceded anything to Islamabad, as some foreign policy experts have alleged. The controversial mention of Balochistan too, he is believed to have argued, can be easily explained and defended.        
	He is looking at a working relationship with a neighbour India has to live with so we can tackle more urgent issues instead of worrying about build-ups and attacks from across the border, an MP said. Singh looked upset at the opposition from those in the Congress peeved with him for taking radical policy decision without consulting the party.         
	But he has also found some support. Union minister Salman Khursheed, for instance, has said Singh has the liberty to move forward on foreign policy issues without looking over his shoulder. Congress sources made it clear, though, the partys official line would be based on Sonias formulation and not necessarily on the PMs submissions. We still have to maintain a government-party distinction, a source said.

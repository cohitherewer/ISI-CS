The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Man with the conceit to change opinion
                                                                                                               Man with the conceit to change opinion
          OUR BUREAU                           Habib Tanvir in Santiniketan in 2008                                  
	June 8: Habib Tanvir, one of Indias foremost theatre artistes, died today in a Bhopal hospital after prolonged illness at the age of 85.         
	Daughter Nageen, also a theatre artiste, was by his side when Tanvir, born Habib Ahmed Khan in Raipur, passed away. The funeral will take place tomorrow.         
	In a theatre career spanning over half a century, Tanvir, which was his pen name, wrote, acted in and directed numerous plays that fetched him many awards, including the Padma Bhushan, rather late in the day in 2002.         
	Tanvir, who first took the stage at the age of 11 in school, founded the theatre group Naya Theatre in Bhopal with wife Moneeka Mishra, whom he had met in Delhi in 1959.         
	When he started working with six actors trained in nacha, the folk narrative dance style of his native Chhattisgarh, he was already a trained artiste, having been to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School in the UK and travelled through Europe watching theatre.         
	Naya Theatre acted as a platform for many folk artistes but it also produced ancient and modern classics. Tanvir worked intensively with rural performers in their native language and style of performance.         
	His theatre was a blend of tradition and modernity, and folk creativity and the modern critical consciousness that took shape during his early years with Left cultural organisations like the Indian Peoples Theatre Association.         
	Charandas Chor, one of his many plays, won him international acclaim at the Edinburgh International Drama Festival in 1982. It was also the play that introduced Calcutta, at the time the Mecca of Indian theatre, to Tanvirs work in 1981. Since then, he performed dozens of times in this city where his wife, partly Bengali, had roots.         
	Tanvir wore his political thinking on his sleeves. He wrote a play called Indra Sabha for the Congress when it was in its socialist phase under Indira Gandhi.         
	He had said: We dont have the gumption that we can change society with theatre but we have the conceit we can influence public opinion.         
	In the 2003 Assembly polls in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Delhi and Rajasthan, he had a brush with the BJP, which accused him of being a Congress stooge, when he played Ponga Pandit, based on a story from Chhattisgarhs repertoire of folk tales. Bajrang Dal activists forcibly stopped performances and Tanvir was routinely greeted with rotten tomatoes and chappals.         
	Delhi didnt treat him any better. His salary grant from the Centre was stopped because apparently he didnt complete some formalities.         
	He had told this newspaper in 2005: One cant come to the end of ones life without having lots of work left undone. But I am satisfied.

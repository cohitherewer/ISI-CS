The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Protest cloud on CM project
                                                                                                               Protest cloud on CM project
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Patna, July 2: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumars dream project, the IIM-like Chandragupta Institute of Management, is now turning out to be his worst nightmare.        
	For the last five days, as many as 48 students of the first batch of the high-profile management college, have been on a fast-unto-death to demand better facilities that include a better faculty.        
	Classes at the institute, with Nitish as chariman of the governing body, began in 2008 when vice-president Md Hamid Ansari inaugurated the school.        
	The hype around the school drew us, but the institute exists only on website and on pen and paper, said Abhishek Kumar, a student, who like 47 of his peers cleared CAT to get entry. The institute that charged Rs 5 lakh as entry fee from every student allegedly offers no faculty or library.        
	Names such as Maitrayee Kollegal of IIM Ahmedabad and Amitabh Deshmukh of Stockholm Business School were waved at us before admission, said Vivek of St Xaviers (Calcutta). Kollegal and Deshmukh vanished after two lectures, said another student Kajal.         
	So far, conditions of three students have deteriorated due to the fast and a doctor was attending to them when this correspondent visited the campus.        
	The first audit report (in possession of The Telegraph) updated on April 14, 2009, indicted the institute for irregularities. The director (V. Mukund Das) has been paid Rs 20,000 in excess to his salary which attracts panel rate of interest or sanction by the board of governors, the report states. Sources reveal that a section of bureaucrats in connivance with the school management are misappropriating funds at the cost of the students careers.         
	Instead of help, students so far have been warned to not pursue politics. As Anjani Kumar, the secretary of the HRD ministry, replied on June 28 to the students memorandum: ...Sincere students will get all support, but politics will not be entertained.         
	Twelve of the 48 students here are qualified engineers who have been employed in institutes after completing engineering. We are not here to do politics, said Krishna Kumar, an engineering graduate.         
	Kumar from NIT, Bhopal, added: The states bureaucracy must appreciate our problems.         
	The striking students are still awaiting their governing body chairman Nitish Kumar to personally intervene in the matter. Nitishji, save your dream project, the placards displayed read.

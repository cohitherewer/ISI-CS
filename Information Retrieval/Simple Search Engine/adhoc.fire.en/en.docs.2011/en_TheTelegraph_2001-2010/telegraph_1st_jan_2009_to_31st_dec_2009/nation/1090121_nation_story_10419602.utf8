          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 20: A judicial probe into last Septembers Batla House encounter will help clear any doubts surrounding it, Arjun Singh said today, reigniting a debate on the police version of the episode.         
	In democracies, it is always better to make things clear, the human resource development minister said, when asked about his opinion on the shootout in which two alleged terrorists, said to be involved in the serial blasts that rocked Delhi on September 13, 2008, were killed by Delhi police.         
	Pressed further on whether a judicial probe would help in dispelling doubts over the authenticity of the encounter, Singh said: Why not?        
	The minister said the Prime Minister too was possibly contemplating a judicial probe. As far as I understand, even the Prime Minister is thinking over this issue, he said.         
	Singh is the second cabinet minister in two months to have suggested that the police version of major terrorist attacks needs clarification.         
	Last month, minority affairs minister A.R. Antulay raised questions about the police handling of the Mumbai terror attacks in November that led to cries from the Opposition seeking his resignation.         
	The Opposition had alleged that Antulays queries strengthened the hands of Pakistan in denying any role in the Mumbai attacks at a time when India claimed it had evidence linking its neighbour to the strikes.         
	The Batla House encounter led to heightened tensions in the area with many local people refusing to accept the police version. A police officer, M.C. Sharma, was also killed in the encounter.         
	The police have also claimed that the two men killed were activists of the Indian Mujahideen. One of the dead men, and a third man arrested alive, were found to be students of Jamia Millia Islamia.         
	But civil rights groups have pointed to several unanswered questions that arise from the sequence of events.         
	The HRD minister also confirmed that the government has revived plans to set up a central madarsa board to regulate education in the seminaries.         
	The board, which will be modelled on the Central Board of Secondary Education, will offer to madarsa students degrees that will be recognised by all universities.         
	A bill in this regard will be introduced in the next session of Parliament, Singh said.         
	Minority shield        
	Vice-President Hamid Ansari has suggested a law should be enacted on the lines of the SC/ST Act to prevent atrocities on minorities. He said the failure of the state to provide security to minorities was disturbing.         
	The procedures to redress grievances of minorities remain somewhat ineffective, Ansari said, adding that the government could consider giving powers to the National Minority Commission to take up investigations.

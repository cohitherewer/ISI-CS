          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                    MP Veerendra Kumar (above), a Kerala legislator, was rushed to hospital in the middle of the budget presentation after he complained of breathlessness. Speaker Somnath Chatterjee adjourned the House for 10 minutes to check if he had been taken to hospital. He returned and informed the House that Kumar was out of danger.

	New Delhi, Feb. 16: The interim budget, smelling more of politics than economics, signals that the Congress election campaign will centre on the aam aadmi.        
	Stopgap finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, the chief Congress strategist, made this clear. He focused on the social sector instead of the expected financial stimulus to shield the market from the impact of the global slowdown.        
	Mukherjee revealed the ruling combines mindset with an Amartya Sen quote, which stresses the shift from growth with equity to downturn with security.        
	His speech may not have delighted industry and investors but the UPA allies and most Congress leaders were happy at the focus on ordinary citizens.        
	Cabinet minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh summed up the mood in the government. The emphasis will remain on the three Gs: gaon (village), garib (the poor) and Gandhi, he said. In this time of crisis, there is a greater need for government support for the common man. We will return for the next five years to ameliorate the (condition of the) poor.        
	Mukherjee indirectly gave the Congress the credit for the welfare schemes by invoking the party symbol, the hand, but took care to express gratitude to the allies who walked the extra mile with us in this journey.        
	He said: Our people will soon be called upon to exercise their democratic right to choose the next government. They have repeatedly shown that they can be relied upon to make sound decisions to secure the nations future.        
	Mukherjee then made a more explicit appeal for votes, saying: They (the voters) have seen how the aam aadmi has become the focus of the development process. They have also seen how our government has successfully steered the country through difficult times. I have no doubt that when the time comes, people will recognise the hand that made it possible. The hand that alone can help our nation on the road to peace and prosperity.        
	He cited the high economic growth rate of the past five years and the increases in social sector budgeting. He then highlighted the governments achievements in fields outside the economy, such as the Indo-US nuclear deal and the Chandrayaan-1 launch.        
	Sonia Gandhi led the enthusiastic treasury benches in thumping the desk.

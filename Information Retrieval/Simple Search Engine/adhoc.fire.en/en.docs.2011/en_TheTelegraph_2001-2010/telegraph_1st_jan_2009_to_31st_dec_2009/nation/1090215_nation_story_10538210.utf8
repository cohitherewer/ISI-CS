  - Two women recount the moment of trauma                            Picture by Amit Datta                                  
	Name: Kumari Sonam               
	Age: 21               
	Residence: Patna              
	Sonam was on the lower berth in coach S-2. The train, she said, was running at a decent speed. But the bogie began jerking suddenly. Before I could react, there was a jolt and I was flung from my seat, she said. It felt like the train was going down a potholed road. The compartment, Sonam said, had started rolling and my head was hitting an iron rod repeatedly. She fell unconscious. When she came to, the student of genetic engineering, bound for Kancheepuram, found herself in Jajpur Hospital.                              Picture by Amit Datta      
	Name: Jyotsna Moitra              
	Age: 52              
	Residence: Behrampore, Murshidabad              
	Jyotsna was in coach S-1, next to the engine. She was on her way to meet her son, doing his PhD in Chennai. I was feeling tired, so I lay on the lower berth. I had kept my head away from the window, she said. In the seat opposite, some youths were playing cards. I was taking an evening nap. Suddenly, it seemed the compartment was thrown in the air and landed with a massive thud. I was thrown off the berth. Jyotsna said: For a moment, I felt I would die. I could feel a hot stream of blood oozing from the right side of my face. She got trapped under other passengers. But the card-playing youths who had also been injured lifted her and took her out of the compartment. Police and local people rushed me to a hospital. I am waiting for my relatives now, Jyotsna said.

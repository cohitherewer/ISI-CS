The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Birthday and game for BJP, crisis can wait
                                                                                                               Birthday and game for BJP, crisis can wait
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 31: The BJP faces a crisis in Bangalore but.        
	Party president Rajnath Singh was in Bhopal, attending the 75th birthday of party veteran Kailash Sarang.        
	Arun Jaitley was busy with cricket  albeit an international between India and Australia at the Kotla.        
	Sushma Swaraj spent the better part of the day at a media summit.        
	M. Venkaiah Naidu was in Bangalore but nobody could tell if it was an official trip or a personal one.        
	L.K. Advani had retreated into a shell.        
	And the average party member was left wondering who the trouble-shooter might be  if there was one.        
	The episode has exposed the lack of a central command, a second-rung party official said. If there were a power centre in place, we might have seen some effort at a solution. Nobody knows what the problems are, whos responsible, who should be spoken to and what the remedy is.        
	Old-timers contrasted the latest round of trouble management  when the B.S. Yeddyurappa government in Karnataka is faced with rebellion  with the first big revolt the BJP had witnessed, in Gujarat 14 years ago.        
	When then chief minister Keshubhai Patel was challenged by colleague Shankersinh Vaghela, the BJP brass had acted fast. The moral authority that leaders like Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Advani then wielded, and the skills of the late Pramod Mahajan, helped forge a solution, even if a patchy one.        
	Now it looks like Yeddyurappa has been left to his own devices, a source said.        
	Part of the problem is the confusion surrounding the process of leadership change in Delhi. With Rajnaths term ending in December, he is more of a lame duck than ever before. Most of his team-mates, too, have made it clear they would not exercise themselves unduly to bail him out of trouble.        
	The RSS, which is supposed to be showing the way to the BJP, is mired in its own problems, its authority undermined by the serial statements and retractions from new chief Mohanrao Bhagwat.        
	A weakened centre has emboldened the chief ministers to assert themselves as satraps with autonomous mandates.        
	We saw it happen to (Narendra) Modi, we are now seeing it in Yeddyurappa. His record is not bad. When he unveiled the statue of (Tamil poet) Thiruvalluvar in Bangalore in August, fending off protests from pro-Kannada groups, he was hailed as a statesman and a pan-south Indian leader. He seems to have taken the praise too seriously, a source said.        
	Yeddyurappa, he added, had signalled he was not prepared to accept diktats from Delhi.        
	Hobbling the BJP further, some of its central leaders such as Ananth Kumar (Bangalore MP), Venkaiah (Rajya Sabha member from Karnataka) and Sushma (who has nurtured Bellary despite losing from there to Sonia Gandhi)  are apparently entangled in regional faction feuds. They might be happy to see Yeddyurappa out, a source said.        
	The anti-Yeddyurappa MLAs arrive in Delhi tomorrow and are expected to meet Rajnath and Advani. Sources said a Vasundhara Raje-style show of strength would not be allowed.        
	The MLAs are welcome to meet the leaders singly, or in twos and threes, but we wont brook a group of 60 or 70, a source said.

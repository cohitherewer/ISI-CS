The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | HIV child refused treatment
                                                                                                               HIV child refused treatment
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Sept. 20: A case in which an HIV positive two-year-old was allegedly refused treatment both at Cuttack and Bhubaneswar private and government hospitals is now under judicial scrutiny for redress against stigma and discrimination.        
	The child hailing from Badabarsingh village in Badamba police station area in Cuttack allegedly contracted the virus after a blood transfusion.        
	Pratap Kumar Nayak, the father of the child and a labourer, approached the high court after private nursing homes and government hospitals allegedly refused to perform a surgery on his son.         
	The father also claimed a compensation of Rs 20 lakh for the trauma and medical expenses.         
	The writ petition came up for a preliminary hearing before the two-judge bench of Acting Chief Justice I.M. Quddusi and Justice B.N. Mohapatra on Thursday.         
	Petitioner counsel advocate Sujata Jena pointed out that the baby was infected following a post-operative transfusion, in a private nursing home. Red Cross Blood Bank had reportedly provided the blood.         
	Parents have been found to have no infection thereby highlighting the possibility of HIV transmission through transfusion. Taking judicial note, Justice Quddusi issued directions to the counsel to submit a detailed report on the case for further hearing.         
	The infant was born on October 21, 2007, and underwent an operation at the private nursing home in Bhubaneswar when he was barely four-days-old for correction of the absence of an anal opening.         
	A second operation followed and in both cases blood transfusion was warranted.         
	A third operation was scheduled, but doctors refused to operate after the child was tested positive.         
	Hospitals, both private and government ones, have shunned the baby since then. Parents also sought help from SCB Medical College.         
	Sources said the case would be listed for hearing when the court reopens on October 5 after the Puja break.

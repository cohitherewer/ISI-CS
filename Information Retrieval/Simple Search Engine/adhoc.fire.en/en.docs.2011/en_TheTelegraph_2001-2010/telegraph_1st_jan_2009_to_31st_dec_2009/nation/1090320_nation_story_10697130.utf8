The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Time for third eyes blurred vision
                                                                                                               Time for third eyes blurred vision
          JAYANTH JACOB                               
	New Delhi, March 19: Pranab Mukherjees sharp poke at the third alternative for lacking cohesive vision has set protagonists of the many-hued collective into stirring up a fitting riposte. There will be no dearth of alternative vision being offloaded on the national stage over the next week; the little problem is, it may not all be very cohesive.         
	There are too many druids busy brewing their own kind of magic to rid the nation of ills that the Congress and the BJP have taken turns to ignore or inflict. The four parties of the Left are drafting an election-eve appeal to the voter to be released on March 24.         
	They are also collaborating with the half a dozen others that make up a yet-unnamed entity  they remain shy, for some reason, of third front  to put together a Vision Statement so the next time Mukherjee decides to take aim, he will have one arrow less in his quiver.         
	The kind would like to believe its a rainbow confluence of solutions in the works; most others have reason to apprehend that whats cooking is a chaos of contrariness. But lets, for a moment, not harp on the unedifying past of such experiments.         
	Forget V.P. Singhs weekly lunching with the Right and dining with the Left government and what a tragic heap that untenable tricycle ride eventually became. Forget the unworkable and serial mess that Chandra Shekhar, H.D. Deve Gowda and I.K. Gujral presided over. Forget that probably the only lasting gift of those tenures was that each of them got awarded the former Prime Minister tag forever. Forget all of that. Look to the future, currently being burnished in the alternate laboratories.         
	Former Prime Minister, self-anointed humble farmer and pretenter to the shaky third front crown, H.D. Deve Gowda, remains intently focused on an agricultural loan-waiver that must include private lenders to have any meaning; when leaders of the would-be ruling combine met last Sunday, he hogged discussion time reeling off statistics to make his point.         
	His neighbour from Andhra Pradesh, Chandrababu Naidu, had brought along CDs to promote his favourite plan  a cash transfer scheme to bail out farmers hit by crop failure.         
	The scheme, or its variants, is currently in vogue in various parts of Latin America and Africa  what beneficiaries promise in return for the bail out is promise to send children to school or have them vaccinated. Naidu is recommending it as just the right trick to win over the rural heartland.         
	We have no sense, yet, of how Gowda and Naidu view each others ideas and which is gaining the favour of the larger collective. We have an even lesser notion of how the alternate Vision Statement intends to round off a few rather awkwardly square differences between those putting their heads together to script it.         
	Naidu, for instance, is a huge votary of the World Bank and its socio-economic vision. The Left most certainly isnt. Jayalalithaa is an outspoken proponent of foreign investment and the free market. The Left most certainly isnt.         
	All of these leaders and their parties have at some time or another happily consorted with the BJP  and there is no guarantee they will not in future.

                                                                                                               Jairam back on poll duty
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Jairam: Trusted soldier                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 25: Jairam Ramesh today quit as Union minister to return to the Congress organisation to oversee publicity and campaigning for the Lok Sabha elections.        
	The resignation of Ramesh, minister of state for commerce and industry as well as power, was immediately accepted by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.        
	Sources said Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and Rahul had sought Rameshs services.        
	Ramesh, known for his communication skills, comes to the party fold at a time the Congress brass isnt happy with an ad campaign put together by a Jaipur agency. Party sources said the agency, picked by the partys publicity committee, had come with catch lines in high-falutin (bookish) Hindi.         
	Ramesh is expected to breathe more life into the punch lines. In 2004, he was credited with coining the winning line, Congress ka haath, aam aadmi ke saath. It became a counterpoint to the NDAs India Shining slogan.

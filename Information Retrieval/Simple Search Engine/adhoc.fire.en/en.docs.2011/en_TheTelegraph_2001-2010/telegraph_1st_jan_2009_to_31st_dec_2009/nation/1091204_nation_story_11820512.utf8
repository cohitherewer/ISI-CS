	Chennai, Dec. 3: Five girls, four boys and a lady teacher were killed when their school van plunged into a temple tank 370km from Chennai on Thursday morning.         
	Passers-by managed to rescue 11 children. Five more kids and a second lady teacher were missing and were feared drowned or trapped inside the van.         
	The van went out of control while trying to overtake another vehicle and fell into the Kathiripulam temple tank in Karipattinam village of Nagapattinam district, which was full because of recent rains.         
	Villagers had hired the private van to take the children to a nursery school.         
	Firefighters have launched a search and water has been pumped out of the tank.         
	The driver and the attendant fled when the van started to sink.

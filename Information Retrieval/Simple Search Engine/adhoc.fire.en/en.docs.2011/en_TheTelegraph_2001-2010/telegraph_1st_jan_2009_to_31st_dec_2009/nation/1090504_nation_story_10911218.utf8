The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Clash of Titans in final lap
                                                                                                               Clash of Titans in final lap
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, May 3: Located on the south banks of Ganga, Pataliputra and Patna Saheb are two new seats that the delimitation commission has carved out from Patna, and these are turning out to be the new battlegrounds for poll veterans.        
	Bahut logon ke paas pad hai; lekin mere paas qad hai (People have posts, but I have clout), Shatrughan Sinha said, referring to the fact that despite staying in the BJP for over three decades, he lacked a party post.        
	The actor intended to convey that his clout was more than what other BJP post-holders lacked  a claim that he has proved in Bihar. Shotgun was the lone BJP leader who declared his candidature from the Patna Saheb seat, much to the discomfiture of BJP and before the party released its candidates list.         
	Post-holders tried to raise questions when the original Bihari Babu shared the dais with Samajvadi Partys Amar Singh holding out a veiled threat that he would fight against Murli Manohar Joshi as an SP nominee if the BJP failed to put an stamp of approval on his declaration.         
	But, he won as he won his party over by virtue of his qad. In a bid to match Shotguns clout, Congress has pitted Shekhar Suman, another actor from Shotguns mohalla  Rajendra Nagar  against him. However, it was Shotgun who helped Suman make a foray into Bollywood and the latter still refers to his rival as Bara Bhai.         
	In the fray there is RJDs Vijay Kumar Sahu  from the Sahu community  a man who has a caste following to match the stars powers.         
	Then there is Lalu Prasad, a veteran, who has thrown his hat in the Pataliputra seat. The railway minister is locked in what is being described as the mother of all battles to retain his position in New Delhi, facing friend-turned-foe Ranjan Yadav as his JD(U) rival.         
	In 1973, Lalu Prasad had travelled as a groom to Rabri Devis home in Ranjan Yadavs car. And the leader visited Ranjan Yadavs Kadamkuan home first after taking his oath as the chief minister in 1990. The two were believed to be inseparable till 2005 when the political bug ate into their relationship.        
	Nitish Kumar inducted Ranjan Yadav in his JD(U) and fielded him against Lalu.        
	There is no better candidate than Ranjan. Because of their association, Ranjan knows all the weaknesses and strengths of Lalu, said a JD(U) leader, adding: Pataliputra offers and interesting battle.         
	Proverbially functioning like a commander, Nitish Kumar has fielded political rookie Kaushilendra Kumar as the JD(U) nominee in Nalanda  the CMs home. Every player of Bihars politics knows that Nitish Kumar wants to rule his home seat by proxy by fielding an yes man.         
	Congress has rewarded Ramswaroop Prasad for voting in favour of Manmohan Singh-sponsored confidence by fielding him as the Congress nominee. RJD-LJP combination has fielded Satish Kumar to take on Kaushilendra in what is described as Nitishs stronghold of Nalanda.

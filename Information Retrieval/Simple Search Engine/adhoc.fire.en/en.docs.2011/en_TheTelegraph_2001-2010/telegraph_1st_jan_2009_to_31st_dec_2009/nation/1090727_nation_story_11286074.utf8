The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Esma stick for Gujarat doctors
                                                                                                               Esma stick for Gujarat doctors
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ahmedabad, July 26: The Gujarat government today invoked the stringent law Esma against a four-day-long, state-wide junior doctors strike and sacked 150 of the 1,800 agitating medicos late in the evening.        
	More will be dismissed or arrested tomorrow if they do not resume work, state health secretary Ravi Saxena said, adding that the doctors would also be expelled from their universities so they cannot complete their PG course.        
	Five infants died at Vadodaras Saayajirao General Hospital on Friday as the strike in government medical colleges hit health services in major cities, with senior doctors struggling to keep hospitals running with a skeletal staff.        
	Esma, or the Essential Services Maintenance Act, declares a strike illegal following which a striker or an instigator can be arrested without a warrant and be jailed for up to a year. Its imposition appeared to be working this evening with signs that the junior doctors, agitating for higher stipends, were reconsidering their stand.        
	A spokesman said: If the doctors continue their strike, they will be arrested and jailed. We are now in a dilemma. We will have to resolve it.        
	He wondered how the government could impose Esma when we are not state government employees; we are just students.        
	The doctors say their stipend of Rs 11,400 a month is the lowest in the country, and that their counterparts in other states get around Rs 25,000 or more. The government says these doctors are basically students, rendering their services as part of their course, so they dont deserve more.        
	Another argument against hiking the stipends is that the tuition fee charged from these students is negligible compared with the lakhs that students of private medical colleges have to pay.        
	Yesterday, a team led by Saxena and the deans of all the government medical colleges had met the doctors and asked them to call off the agitation. Saxena said the government had promised to consider their demand and take a favourable decision within two months, but the doctors appeared very adamant, so we had no choice but to sack them.        
	He said the medicos were spoiling their own career. We have written to their parents, advising them to counsel their children, who have worked hard to reach this level.        
	The principal secretary, health, said that once the universities expelled the doctors, they would not be able to enrol for any postgraduate course anywhere in the country.

	Dec. 18: The Supreme Court today denied anticipatory bail to a Goa politician accused of raping a Russian woman, following which a Margao court declared the accused absconding and issued an arrest warrant.        
	John Fernandes had been hiding from police since the high court on December 15 cancelled his bail, granted by the trial court on December 8. Fernandes, who lost the 2007 Assembly polls on a Save Goa Front ticket, allegedly raped the woman in a car after offering her a lift on December 1.        
	The 25-year-old woman, a liaison executive for Russian tourists at a local five-star bar, later claimed he had spiked her drinks. The woman had initially alleged an attempt to rape, but this was changed to a rape charge after the Russian consulate forwarded a complaint by her about intimidation by influential people.        
	Fernandes has accused Goa tourism minister F. Xavier of framing him. The case will be heard on January 4.

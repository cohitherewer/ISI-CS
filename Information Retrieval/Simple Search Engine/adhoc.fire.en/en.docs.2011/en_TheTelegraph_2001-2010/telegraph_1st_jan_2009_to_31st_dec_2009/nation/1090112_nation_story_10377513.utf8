The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Soren quit letter ready, with rider
                                                                                                               Soren quit letter ready, with rider
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, Jan. 11: Shibu Soren has announced that he would step down as Jharkhand chief minister at 11am tomorrow and said he expected the UPA to accept Champai Soren as his successor.        
	The announcement came as alliance leader Lalu Prasad confirmed that his RJD would either back former chief minister Madhu Koda or support Presidents rule.        
	But Soren said he expected the UPA to honour his choice. If it didnt, he said, he would fight to retain the chief ministers chair as long as possible and then go for fresh polls.        
	My resignation letter is ready. How much time will it take for me to go to Raj Bhavan? I am only waiting for Delhis reply on our partys decision to make Champai the next chief minister, Soren, who turned 65 today, said.

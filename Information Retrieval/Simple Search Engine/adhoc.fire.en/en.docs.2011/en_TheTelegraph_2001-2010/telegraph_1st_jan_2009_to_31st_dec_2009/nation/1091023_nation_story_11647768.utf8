The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pawar party slips but retains sway
                                                                                                               Pawar party slips but retains sway
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI AND SATISH NANDGAONKAR                          Sharad Pawar                                  
	New Delhi/Mumbai, Oct. 22: Sharad Pawars Nationalist Congress Party may retain key portfolios in the new Maharashtra government despite pressure from its ally  the Congress  after exceeding its own expectations in the Assembly elections.         
	The Congress leadership has indicated to Pawar that it may allow the NCP to retain the critical posts of deputy chief minister and home minister in the new government, top NCP sources told The Telegraph today.         
	Chhagan Bhujbal, therefore, could stay on as deputy chief minister and Jayant Patil is tipped to retain charge of home, the sources said.         
	Water resources minister Ajit Pawar, the nephew of the NCP boss and one of the contenders for his legacy, is unlikely to receive a major boost though when portfolios are allocated, the sources added.         
	Top state Congress leaders, led by Vilasrao Deshmukh, have been arguing against giving key portfolios like home to a weakened NCP.         
	Pawars party has won 62 seats, nine less than its 2004 tally and 20 fewer than the Congresss share of 82 this time..        
	But several Maharashtra Congress leaders were expecting the NCP to do worse, a result that would have allowed the Grand Old Party to further dominate its relationship with Pawar.         
	The NCPs own assessment  prior to the elections  suggested that the party was likely to win around 55 seats and would be fortunate to get 60.         
	The NCP is also happy because the results vindicate, in its view, the argument that the Congress could not have won Maharashtra had it contested alone.         
	We had compromised (in seat sharing) before the elections but we have been vindicated, Pawar said, describing the performance as satisfactory.         
	NCP leaders pointed out that the party had displayed a better strike rate, of more than 50 per cent, than the Congress.         
	Political analysts had predicted doom, but if we are winning 62 of the 114 seats (contested), it hardly shows the party in decline, said a relaxed R.R. Patil, the Maharashtra chief of the NCP.         
	Though it may appear that we have less seats than the last election, you have to understand that we contested in 124 constituencies in 2004 and won 71 compared to 114 this year. After the Lok Sabha debacle, we have managed to recover lost ground, Patil said.        
	But despite the numbers, the NCP is concerned because the results have exposed cracks in some traditional fortresses.         
	Former deputy chief minister Vijaysinh Mohite-Patil, one of Pawars closest aides and the sugar baron who has helped the NCP control large chunks of western Maharashtra, has lost in Pandharpur to a party rebel.         
	Mohite-Patils loss suggests that the clout of one of western Maharashtras biggest families may be waning.

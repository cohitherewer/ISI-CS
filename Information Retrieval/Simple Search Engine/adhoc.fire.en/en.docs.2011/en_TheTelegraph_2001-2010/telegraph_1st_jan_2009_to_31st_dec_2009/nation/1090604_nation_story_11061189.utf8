The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | House scare for poll losers
                                                                                                               House scare for poll losers
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 3: Twenty-six former ministers and 23 ex-MPs have been asked to vacate their Lutyens Delhi bungalows within a month as estate managers struggle to house new entrants.        
	Any minister or MP who fails to vacate within a month will have to pay market rate rent, which varies from Rs 50,000 to Rs 1 lakh (per month), said urban development minister Jaipal Reddy.        
	The directorate of estates, which comes under Reddys ministry, has an unenviable job: the list of those who have to leave or shift to smaller quarters includes the likes of Lalu Prasad, Ram Vilas Paswan, Mani Shankar Aiyar, Shankarsinh Vaghela, A.R. Antulay and Renuka Choudhary.        
	Some are delaying the process, by seeking an extension, leaving officials scratching their heads on accommodating new ministers and MPs. Calls and letters for more time inundated the estate office hours after Reddy set the deadline.        
	Reddys ministry made it clear the requests couldnt be granted. Usually, however, a compromise is made and occupants allowed to stay on after paying some rent.        
	We are under tremendous pressure to allot bungalows to at least 26 ministers. If we give former MPs and ministers extension, where will these people stay? asked one official.        
	Ministry sources are wary of Paswan and Lalu Prasad. Paswan turned his bungalow, next to Sonia Gandhis 10 Janpath, into an office of his Lok Janshakti Party as soon as he lost the polls. Sources say he has now sought an allotment in the name of his party.        
	Lalu Prasad has sought to retain his Type VIII bungalow on the basis of his seniority. If a House panel accepts the former railway ministers request, he will have to pay rent. But since he is entitled to a bungalow, though a smaller one, he might not have to pay the market rate.         
	No such luck for his ex-RJD ministers M.A.A. Fatmi, Kanti Singh, Raghunath Jha and Akhilesh Prasad Singh. They lost the polls and have to move out.        
	Priya Ranjan Das Munshi has also been asked to vacate, but the ailing ex-minister, who didnt contest, may be given an extension on health grounds, the sources said.        
	Officials are also wrestling with newcomers choices. Some, like foreign minister S.M. Krishna, are lucky: he has got a bungalow, 19 Teen Murti Lane, occupied by K. Natwar Singh earlier.

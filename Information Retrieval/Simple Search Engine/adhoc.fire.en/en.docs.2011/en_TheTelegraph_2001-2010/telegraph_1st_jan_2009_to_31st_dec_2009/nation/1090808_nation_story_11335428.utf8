	Mumbai, Aug. 7: An ayurvedic physician from Yerwada near Pune is critically ill with swine flu, 10 days after falling sick, apparently because of delayed treatment.        
	Babasaheb Mane, 35, a Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery, was admitted to Punes Sassoon Hospital today in a critical stage, doctors said.        
	He was immediately put on ventilator. Only a miracle can save him, said Dr Vijay Sonawane of Sassoon, blaming delayed treatment.        
	Manes relatives said he fell ill 10 days ago and after a couple of days of self-medication with ayurvedic medicines and common allopathic drugs, his condition worsened.         
	He was taken to Inlaks hospital in Punes Camp area  he worked there part-time. They sent his swab for testing, said Manes elder brother Deepak. His results came last evening.        
	A lot of foreigners visiting Pune come to his nursing home for treatment. He could have contracted the disease from them..., Deepak said.        
	His wife Aparna, too, is down with swine flu. Since there was no delay in detection in her case, she is recovering and doctors there say she will be okay.

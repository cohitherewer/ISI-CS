The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Valley turnout: 26%
                                                                                                               Valley turnout: 26%
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Anantnag, April 30: Voters had surged to booths when Kashmir went to Assembly polls last October. Six months on, that euphoria was missing.         
	Sixteen Assembly segments that make up south Kashmirs Anantnag parliamentary constituency that voted today recorded a turnout of 26 per cent  in other words, less than half the number who had trooped to polling stations last year.         
	In Tral and Pampore, the turnout was less than 5 per cent compared with 48 and 43 per cent in the October elections. Less than 25 per cent turned up to cast their ballot in Homshalibugh, Wachi, Shopian and Kulgam, where the Jamaat-e-Islami has a strong base.         
	Separatists, who had called a 50-hour strike in the state and had asked people to boycott todays vote  the first in Kashmir in the five-phase polls  claimed victory. People have reposed faith in us and only a handful, who are relatives and friends of the candidates, have voted, Hurriyat hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani said.         
	IT graduate Farooq Naqashbandi, a private firm employee from Anantnags Dialgam village, said he voted in the Assembly elections for the development of his area. But this time I stayed away because the Lok Sabha means nothing to me. It can bring no development.        
	The mood in Anantnag, the pocket borough of the Opposition PDP, was the party would, at the most, win one seat.         
	The turnout was the lowest in Tral, where only 3 per cent of the electorate voted. Militants had shot dead a National Conference leader in this district last week.        
	In Pulwama, about 100 youths shouted pro-freedom slogans and burnt tyres. At many booths, polling staff appeared relaxed, with only an occasional voter turning up.         
	Chief electoral officer B.R. Sharma said the low turnout  though it was higher than the 15 per cent in 2004  was in keeping with the general trend in Kashmir: less participation in parliamentary elections than in state polls.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jaipur, Sept. 9: An outing in the Pink City turned sour for four friends when two of them drowned in a swimming pool of a five-star hotel here today.        
	The four, in their twenties and said to be Delhi residents, had travelled to the city as part of a tour of Rajasthan and checked into the Jaipur Ashok hotel yesterday.         
	After watching a film at the Raj Mandir cinema today, they returned to the hotel around 3pm and decided to go for a swim in the pool.        
	Sources in the hotel said since the pool was under maintenance, the young men were refused permission for a swim.         
	The sources said the pools condition was dismal with moss deposits and therefore it had been kept off limits to guests.         
	While two of the friends tried convincing the hotel authorities to allow them into the pool, the two others  Manish Sharma, 24, and Parminder, 26  took off for a dip. The hotel sources said they repeatedly told the men not to swim, but they refused to listen.        
	Apparently, one of them knew swimming while the other did not.         
	The one who did not know how to swim went inside the nine-foot deep pool and could not come out as it was very slippery. His friend tried to help him but he too could not bring himself out because of the moss.         
	They shouted out for help, and hearing that, the other two friends jumped in to the pool to save them.        
	The hotel authorities then pulled the four out and took them to Sawai Man Singh Hospital. Manish and Parminder died in the hospital.        
	The police denied any foul play.        
	Hospital sources said the exact cause of drowning could only be ascertained after the post-mortem tomorrow but added that initial indications were that they may have consumed excessive water.

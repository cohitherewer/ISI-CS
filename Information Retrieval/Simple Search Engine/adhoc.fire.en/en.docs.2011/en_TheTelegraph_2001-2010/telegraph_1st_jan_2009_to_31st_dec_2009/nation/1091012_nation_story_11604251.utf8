                                                                                                               Hurriyat in envoy row
                            
	Srinagar, Oct. 11: Hurriyat Conference chairman Mirwaiz Umer Farooq today made the controversial claim that the US may appoint a special envoy for Kashmir.        
	The Mirwaiz recently returned from New York after attending a conference of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference during which the 57-member Islamic body appointed an envoy for Kashmir. Delhi criticised the move and asked the OIC to stay out of the issue.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Oust Menon plot: Book
                                                                                                               Oust Menon plot: Book
                            
	London, Oct. 5 (PTI) British spy agency MI5 tried to get rid of Indias first high commissioner to the UK, V.K. Krishna Menon, because of his Soviet leanings but failed after Jawaharlal Nehru backed him, a book has revealed.        
	The attempt to oust high commissioner V.K. Krishna Menon failed because of the support of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, the book, The Defence of the Realm: The Authorised History of MI5, by Professor Christopher Andrew, says.        
	The book says Guy Liddel, a deputy director-general of MI5, had written in a personal diary that he told a joint intelligence committee we were doing what we would to get rid of Menon, who was Indias envoy to the UK till 1952.        
	Fears of Menons pro-Soviet sympathies were well founded. On at least one occasion during his later political career in India, the KGB, former Soviet spy agency, paid his election expenses, the book says.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Indian cash for Obama aide
                                                                                                               Indian cash for Obama aide
                              Lawrence Summers                            
	New York, April 5 (PTI): Reliance Industries and TCS are among the firms that paid thousands of dollars to Barack Obama aide Lawrence Summers for his association with the companies or for speeches, according to reports.        
	Tata Consultancy Services paid economist Summers, the director of Obamas national economic council, $67,500 (Rs 33.7 lakh) for an engagement on September 21 last year, Internet newspaper Huffingtonpost has said.        
	Reliance was listed under the section where compensation of more than $5,000 (Rs 2.5 lakh) was given to Summers for being a member of their international advisory boards, Huffingtonpost added.        
	The revelations came after financial disclosure reports made public by the White House.         
	They suggested Summers earned millions of dollars over the past year for being part of the advisory board and for giving speeches to financial institutions, including some later rescued under the US governments bailout programme.        
	In all, Summers was said to have earned $2.7 million (over Rs 13.5 crore) in speech fees for over 40 appea- rances before organisations and companies, the report said.        
	Among the firms that paid large sums as speaking fees to Summers were JP Morgan ($67,500), Citigroup ($54,000), Goldman Sachs ($135,000), Lehman Brothers ($67,500), McKinsey ($135,000) PricewaterhouseCoopers ($67,500) and American Express ($67,500), the report added.        
	Summers also received about $5.2 million (Rs 26 crore) over the past year in salaries from hedge fund DE Shaw.        
	Quoting White House spokesman Ben LaBolt, The Washington Post said: Given that Summers is widely recognised as one of the countrys most distingui- shed economists and formerly served as treasury secretary, there was considerable interest in hearing his economic insights.        
	Summers wasnt the only Obama aide to have earned large sums from such assignments.         
	National security adviser James L. Jones earned $1.1 million (Rs 5.5 crore) last year in compensation from five corporations, in addition to a $900,000 (around Rs 4.5 crore) salary from the US Chamber of Commerce.        
	David Axelrod, Obamas chief political strategist, received $1.55 million (Rs 7.75 crore) from public affairs firms, The Washington Post said.        
	White House social secretary Desiree Rogers recei- ved $1.8 million (Rs 9 crore) in salary from Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas, where she was president, as well as $350,000 (Rs 1.75 crore) from Allstate, where she managed the firms social networking division.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Home truths force drive in Rajasthan
                                                                                                               Home truths force drive in Rajasthan
          RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR                          Gehlot                                  
	Jaipur, Sept. 16: Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, a staunch follower of Gandhian ideals  both of the Mahatma and the 10 Janpath kind  today issued rigid dos and donts for his cabinet colleagues amid reports that some of them were spending lavishly to spruce up their houses.        
	The official communiqu says the measures are in view of the drought conditions and the downturn. But sources said Gehlot wanted to send a message to some ministers who were apparently spending taxpayers money on doing up their quarters.        
	Sources said PWD minister Pramod Jain Bhaya, whose department is in charge of sanctioning funds for repair and maintenance of government houses, had spent around Rs 29.6 lakh on doing up his new quarters in upscale Civil Lines area.         
	Golma Devi, an Independent MLA who is the khadi minister and wife of influential tribal leader K.L. Meena, is said to have spent Rs 32.92 lakh on redecorating her home.         
	Bhaya could not be reached for comment. But Golma Devi said she was not aware of the amount spent. Only plastering and painting has been done in the house. And some security measures have been updated. Nothing new has been added. The house was not in a state to live in, so it has been made liveable, thats all. I dont know the amount spent as that has been sanctioned by the PWD, she said.        
	An amount running into a little over Rs 2 lakh is said to have been spent on even Gehlots chief ministerial bungalow. This, the sources said, when about Rs 3.64 crore had been spent on the same bungalow when Vasundhara Raje was chief minister. Rajes present residence, No. 13 Civil Lines, has also been spruced up.        
	Gehlots drive, which comes days after Sonia Gandhi flew economy class to Mumbai and Bangalore and Rahul Gandhi opted for AC chair car travel to Ludhiana, can hit all this hard. The first axe falls on the renovation and redecoration of ministerial residences, which has been stopped unless absolutely necessary. The circular says only breakdown maintenance will be allowed from now.        
	C.K. Mathew, principal secretary, finance, said: Only those whose work orders have already been issued would be allowed to carry on the work. Any other redoing or renovation work of bungalows cannot be taken up from now.         
	Gehlots ministers will also have to seek his permission for any kind of air or foreign travel. In both cases, ministers will travel economy class and travel abroad only if the sponsoring agency provides the tickets and other benefits.        
	Ministers and officials would have to seek the finance departments permission for hiring of cars, consultants and outside computer operators.

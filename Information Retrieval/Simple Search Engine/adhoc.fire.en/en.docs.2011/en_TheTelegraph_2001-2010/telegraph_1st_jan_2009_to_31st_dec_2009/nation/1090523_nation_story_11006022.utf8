The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Flood leaks in Mahanadi delta
                                                                                                               Flood leaks in Mahanadi delta

	Cuttack, May 22: At least 350 patches in river embankments of the Mahanadi delta system are still vulnerable to breaches that can flood a large tract of coastal Orissa during the coming monsoon.        
	The vulnerable patches were detected during a pre-flood survey of the entire network of river embankments last week, irrigation department officials admitted, but were reluctant to divulge details.        
	Sources, however, said the 350 patches vulnerable to breaches covered nearly 2,000km stretch of the river embankment, which was in a weak condition. These were in similar state last year.         
	The delta region has a network of 3,924km embankments of the Mahanadi, Luna, Chitrotpala, Kathajodi, Daya, Bhargavi, Kushabhadra and Devi across Cuttack, Kendrapada, Jagatsinghpur, Puri, Khurda and Nayagarh districts in coastal Orissa. Most of the patches were detected in embankments in Kendrapada (75), Jagatsinghpur (49), Prachi (43), Puri (42) and Mahanadi south (31) irrigation divisions.         
	Repairs have been taken up on the basis of the pre-flood survey, but its unlikely to be completed before the onset of monsoon.        
	The condition of the vast 3,924km embankment is weak and had turned vulnerable because of breaches, as they have not been repaired since 1982  except for routine patch-up work after floods in 2001, 2003 and 2008. Over a hundred breaches had occurred in the Mahanadi delta region during the floods last year and a large number of areas were left marooned in the six districts.

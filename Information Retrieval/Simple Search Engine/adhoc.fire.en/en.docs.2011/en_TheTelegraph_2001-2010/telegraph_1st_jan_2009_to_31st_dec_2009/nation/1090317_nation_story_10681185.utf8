The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tall talk and more taxes
                                                                                                               Tall talk and more taxes
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                                      
	New Delhi, March 16: Spend and be damned  that seems to be the CPM motto in its manifesto released today.        
	The CPM, which has never appeared to favour fiscal prudence, today promised to scrap certain provisions in the fiscal responsibility act that its government in Bengal has repeatedly refused to sign.        
	The promise would be music to states that would like to borrow beyond their means to pay for pet projects.        
	The party also recommended doubling the Centres spending on various plans to 10 per cent of the gross domestic product.        
	This would mean that the government, already saddled with a huge deficit, would end up more in the red. It could see inflation creeping up again, interest rates rising and Indias credit rating abroad falling.        
	The fiscal deficit  the gap between the governments income and expenses  is expected to top Rs 3,62,000 crore in the coming fiscal. This comes on top of a deficit of Rs 3,26,515 crore (more than 6 per cent of the GDP) in 2008-09, which had bloated against a budgeted deficit of Rs 1,33,287 crore (2.5 per cent of the GDP).        
	The chance that such recommendations will actually be heard out, however, depends on whether the government that takes over in June requires CPM support or not. Weakening finances have already prompted Standard amp; Poors to say on February 24 that it may cut Indias credit rating to junk.        
	The Left parties, which had given outside support to the ruling UPA, pulled out last year over the Indo- US nuclear deal. They had stalled several key economic reforms before that.        
	In its manifesto, the CPM plugged fresh ways of raising resources to pay for its grandiose spending plans. The party stands for a complete halt to privatisation, it said.        
	Two years ago, the CPM, along with smaller UPA partners, had held to ransom a process of selling small stakes in state-run companies to the public at large.        
	The move could have fetched the UPA some much-needed money, helped some companies list themselves and others to enlarge their capital base.        
	The CPM manifesto also talked of raising taxes on the rich, introducing inheritance tax and unearthing black money.        
	A. Prasanna, the head of research with ICICI Securities, said: We have reached an optimal tax limit, and it would be difficult to push up rates to earn more resources. If we want to spend more money... then we need to earn it somehow or else we will be pushing up interest and inflation rates.

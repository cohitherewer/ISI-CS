The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Poll bares Cong myth
                                                                                                               Poll bares Cong myth
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, May 21: Congress, which secured 10.26 per cent of Bihars votes in 2009 polls as against their previous record of 4.49 per cent votes in 2004, is now celebrating the 5.77 per cent rise in its vote bank.        
	However, unlike Uttar Pradesh where the party has shown a sign of revival, it may be too early for the Congress to celebrate its political success in Bihar as yet.         
	In this poll, 30 of the 37 Congress candidates had to forfeit their security deposits. The list contains star candidates such as Lalu Prasads brother-in-law Aniruddha Prasad, alias Sadhu Yadav, who made headlines for deserting sister Rabri Devi and jija Lalu Prasad  two people who were responsible for his foray into politics.        
	Interestingly, the party that has been contesting in alliance with the RJD for the past 15 years and was left with supposedly little organisational strength at the grassroots, managed to import 17 leaders from other parties  mainly RJD and LJP  and pitted them against RJD-LJP combination.        
	Fifteen of the 17 candidates brought in from other parties also had to forfeit their deposits, including Sadhu Yadav.        
	Of the 17, only two won and two trailed second. Veterans K.K. Tiwary and Vijay Shankar Dubey trailed on fourth and fifth spots securing 22,780 and 12,104 votes in Buxar and Siwan, respectively.         
	On the eve of the poll, Lalu Prasad offered three seats to the Congress angering Indias oldest party. Thus, it came as no surprise that the party played a spoiler to the RJD-LJP combination.        
	Congress nominee Shakeel Ahmed secured 1.11 lakh votes against 1.54 lakh earned by RJDs Abdul Bari Sidiqui in Madhubani (north Bihar). With the Congress nominee causing sharp split in Muslim votes in his favour, BJPs Hukumdeo Narayan Yadav, who earned 1.64 lakh votes, emerged victorious. In the battle between RJD and Congress, BJP emerged victorious.        
	Similarly, Congress nominee Vinita Vijay secured 1.08 lakh votes against the 1.47 lakh in favour of LJP-RJDs Bhagwan Lal Sahni and the 1.95 lakh in favour of JD(U)-BJPs Jainarayan Nishad.         
	Here, the Congress made inroads into the upper caste Bhumihar-Brahmin votes, depriving Sahni of victory.         
	On the other hand, by securing 25.85 per cent (RJD 19.3 per cent and LJP 6.55 per cent), the RJDLJP combination has emerged as the opponent to the BJP-JD(U) alliance. RJD-LJP has ended up on the second spot in as many as 36 of Bihars 40 seats.        
	Vote statistics also suggest that the Congresss organisational strength still stands nowhere for the party polled barely 401 votes in Patna Sahebs Bakhtiyarpur Assembly segment, home to BPCC chief Anil Sharma, who hovered on the Bihar skyline in helicopters more often than Sonia and Rahul Gandhi.         
	Senior leaders feel that general secretary Rahul Gandhi will have to make a realistic assessment of the ground reality and carry out an overhauling of the state Congress, if he wishes to see it succeed against the NDA that got 35 per cent of votes from EBCs and Pasmanda Muslims, besides a chunk of upper caste votes.         
	Nitish Kumar-led dispensation has a well-organised political and bureaucratic set-up at the grassroots that ensures credit for centrally-sponsored NREGA and other poverty alleviation programmes that have led to Congresss grand show in other states.

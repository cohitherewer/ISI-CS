          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Patna, Feb. 4: The crime of accepting a bribe of Rs 25  and that too 23 years ago  has never ceased to haunt a Bihar doctor who is now 75 years old.         
	Patna High Court on Tuesday reduced a years jail term awarded by a CBI court to the doctor to three months. But it hiked the fine from Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,000.         
	CBI sleuths had caught Balgovind Prasad red-handed accepting a bribe of Rs 25 from a railway cleaner for issuing a medical certificate to the latter in 1985. Prasad was then posted as a doctor of the Eastern Railway at Mahendru Ghat here.         
	The central investigating agency instituted a case of bribery against the doctor and the case dragged for seven years. The CBI filed a chargesheet against him in 1992. The CBI court on November 23, 1992, established Prasad as guilty, sentencing him to a year in prison and slapped a fine of Rs 1,000 on him.         
	Prasad moved the high court against the order in the same year and was released on bail. Yesterday, the court of K.K. Mandal delivered its ruling.         
	The case was too old and had been dragging inordinately, the court observed, reducing the prison term to three months. But it also increased the fine.         
	The court directed the accused to surrender in the lower court concerned within six weeks and undergo the conviction period, besides paying the fine.         
	Now the police are all set to arrest the 75-year-old doctor if the latter fails to surrender on his own within the stipulated time period.         
	While Umashankar Singh appeared on behalf of the doctor, B.K. Sinha pleaded for the CBI in the high court.

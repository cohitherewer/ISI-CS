The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Downturn gripe? Serve curry
                                                                                                               Downturn gripe? Serve curry
                            
	London, Sept. 13 (PTI): British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has served chicken curry and other delicacies from India to woo trade union bosses who are unhappy with public spending cuts amid recession.        
	Chequers, Browns country residence, substituted the traditional beer and sandwiches with eastern dishes at the dinner meet, Daily Mail reported.        
	Browns move comes after a threat of a union revolt that could damage the Labour partys prospects in the next general election due in mid-2010.        
	At the dinner, Brown reportedly promised the union leaders he would not cut school and hospital jobs while dealing with national debt.        
	While the Prime Minister made it clear that there will be tough choices on public spending in future years, he reiterated his commitment to the role of public services and manufacturing..., a spokesperson for 10 Downing Street said.

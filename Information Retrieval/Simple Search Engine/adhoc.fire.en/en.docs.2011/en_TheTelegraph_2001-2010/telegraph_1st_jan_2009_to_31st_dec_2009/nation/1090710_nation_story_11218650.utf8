The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Racist? We love India and sambar: Aussie team
                                                                                                               Racist? We love India and sambar: Aussie team
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, July 9: A visiting team from the Australian education ministry today insisted that the country was safe for Indian students and denied the recent attacks were racist.        
	Colin Walters, team leader and representative from the department of education, employment and workplace relations, said the attacks were crimes of opportunism by drunken men and teenagers.        
	In most cases, expensive gear like laptops, iPhones and costly jewellery worn by the students had attracted the assailants, Walters said.        
	He added that the assaults in Melbourne were a result of the victims having visited sensitive areas at odd hours. The universities have issued circulars to international students to take precautions against going to sensitive areas.        
	Walters said: The existence of a quarter million Indians in Australia is a clear example that we are not a racist nation. He claimed Australians loved everything Indian  food, films and jewellery.        
	Indian films, (such as) Kambakkht Ishq, are a big hit. Many Australian families are familiar with biryani, sambar and rotis.        
	The delegation, however, would not elaborate on the action taken against the alleged attackers. We cannot give any details as the cases are pending in the courts, a team member said. Asked whether the recession had any role in the attacks on foreign students, David Hanna, deputy secretary with the Victoria provincial government, said there could not be any definite motive behind the attacks.        
	The offences were not committed by any organised criminals. In most cases, the attackers threatened (the victims) and ran away with whatever they could grab, he said.

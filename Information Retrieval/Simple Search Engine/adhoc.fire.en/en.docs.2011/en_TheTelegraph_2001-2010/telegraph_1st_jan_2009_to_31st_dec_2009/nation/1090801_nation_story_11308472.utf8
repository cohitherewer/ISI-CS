                                                                                                               14-year-old boy kidnaps toddler nephew for ransom
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 31: If the victim was unusually young at two-and-a-half years, the kidnapper was all of 14.        
	Teenager Sumit Singh (name changed) was picked up today for allegedly abducting his toddler nephew during a visit to his sisters home in Delhi for Teej, a festival that celebrates family life.        
	Delhi police apprehended Sumit at his home in Haryanas Panipat along with his father Dharam Singh, 42, the alleged plotter and the kidnapped childs maternal grandfather.        
	Not much is known yet about Dharams financial condition, but officers said the motive was money: the kidnappers had asked their wealthy relatives for a ransom of Rs 1 crore.        
	The victims paternal grandfather, Balwant Singh, runs a security agency in Delhi employing 250 guards but ironically, the baby was kidnapped from inside his home. The babys father is a jeweller.        
	Sumit had arrived at their house with Teej gifts on July 20 and stayed for two days. He allegedly told the police he lured his nephew outdoors on July 21 and handed him over to Dharam, who was waiting outside.        
	It somehow took Balwant all of five days to approach the police. On July 26, he lodged a complaint with Nangloi police station, saying his grandson had disappeared while playing in front of the house and that he had received a ransom call.        
	The family and the police inserted missing persons notices in newspapers and had the childs photographs beamed on TV. After three days of search, the police got their first lead.        
	On July 29, the family received a phone call from the kidnappers that the investigators traced to an STD booth at Bawana J.J. Colony in Delhi. The police prepared a sketch of the caller from the description provided by the booth owner.        
	Family members then mentioned Sumits visit. A Delhi police team went to Panipat to question the teen, who apparently broke down and revealed the plot.        
	Dharam allegedly confessed he had put his grandson up at an orphanage in Sonepat, from where the police have brought him back to Delhi. Sumit has been sent to an observation home and Dharam to judicial custody for 14 days.        
	Officers said juvenile crime had risen by 8.9 per cent in 2008 and 7.8 per cent in 2007 in Delhi and its neighbourhood. An eight-year-old boy slit his six-year-old neighbours throat in this January during a fight over a game.

                                                                                                               Crisis brunt on women
          CITHARA PAUL                                        
	New Delhi, March 7: The global economic crisis will hurt women more than men, eroding previous years equality gains in the workplace and at home, the International Labour Organisation has said in a report.        
	Global Employment Trends 2009, released yesterday ahead of International Womens Day (March 8), warns that women are at greater risk of losing their jobs compared with men.        
	Overall, between 2.4 crore and 5.2 crore people are expected to lose their jobs worldwide, of whom 1 crore to 2.2 crore could be women.        
	The report predicts the global unemployment rate for women could reach between 6.5 and 7.4 per cent, compared with 6.1 to 7 per cent for men (the figures for women in 2007 and 2008 were 6 per cent and 6.3 per cent).        
	Analysing several scenarios for the year, the report says men too will feel the recessions impact but women will face multiple disadvantages.        
	For instance, women would be more likely to be forced to take up low-paid informal and vulnerable jobs, with the threat of the sack hanging constantly over their heads.        
	Women may cope by engaging in working longer hours or by taking multiple low-income jobs, but still have to maintain unpaid care commitments (at home), the director of the ILOs Bureau for Gender Equality, Jane Hodges, said.        
	She said women would see their control over property and resources weaken and would have less social protection.        
	According to the ILOs estimates, between 50.5 and 54.7 per cent of the global female workforce will be engaged in vulnerable jobs in 2009, against 47.2 to 51.8 per cent of men. These figures, however, also mean more men will have to take up vulnerable jobs this year compared with previous years.        
	The recession will be more detrimental to women than to men in most regions of the world, and most clearly in Latin America and the Caribbean, the report suggests.        
	The regions where women would suffer the least are East Asia, the developed countries and the nations of southeast Europe outside the European Union. These regions, the report says, had narrower gender gaps in job opportunities before the crisis struck.        
	The ILO has predicted the global job crisis will worsen, and has urged creative solutions to address the gender gap. ILO director-general Juan Somavia has cited policy measures such as:          Sustainable and quality jobs open to both men and women.  Broader social protection for women, including unemployment benefits and insurance schemes that recognise the genders vulnerable position in the labour market.  Inclusion of women in decision-making processes.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Fatwa against political iftar
                                                                                                               Fatwa against political iftar
          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 7: The countrys highest Islamic seminary has issued a fatwa against iftars hosted by political parties, saying they go against Islamic tradition.        
	The iftar has no place for lies, hypocrisy and politics, says the fatwa by the Darul Uloom of Deoband, discouraging Muslims from attending these iftars.        
	Political parties of all hues in India hold iftars  the evening meal when Muslims break their Ramazan fast  to attract the communitys votes and network with its leaders. Even US President Barack Obama hosted an iftar last week.        
	At an iftar held by the Trinamul Congress minority cell in Calcutta yesterday, Mamata Banerjee had announced a sop, saying railway recruitment exams could now be taken in Urdu. Trinamul plans two more iftars on September 9 and 16, which Mamata is to attend.        
	If the purpose behind such gatherings is political, then religion doesnt come into the picture, Mufti Zahoor Nadvi of the Darul Uloom said.        
	Another argument against political iftars relates to the source of their funding. It would be against Islam if the source of money is the liquor business or interest from loans, said Mubarak Hussein of the Jamiat Ulema, Delhi.        
	The fatwa, however, doesnt extend to politicians being invited to private iftars.        
	Leading Urdu dailies such as Inquilab, Siasat, Khabrein and Qurbani too have decided to boycott political iftars.        
	Politicians think hosting iftars will garner them the communitys support in elections. So they wear the skullcap but as soon as the show is over, they dump the community, Inquilab editor Shahid Latif said. Muslims are fed up. They feel humiliated whenever such iftar showoffs take place.        
	Qurbani editor Ali Mubarak said: We have decided not to publish any news on political iftar parties as these are nothing but political nautankis (drama).        
	Sources said the former Congress chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna, had started the political iftars in the 1970s. He brought them to Delhi when he joined Indira Gandhis cabinet. Indira quickly took to the practice and various parties have followed suit since then, including the Left.        
	Muslim leaders have criticised political iftars earlier too. Mufti Mukkarram Ahmed, Shahi Imam of Delhis Fatehpuri Masjid, had said eight years ago: I avoid going to these political nautankis. But if I must, I carry my khazoor (dates) to break my fast because you can never be sure of the source of the money behind these lavish parties, and Islam says what you eat for iftar must be from halal kamai (honest income).

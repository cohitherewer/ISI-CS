          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Guwahati, March 24: Unidentified gunmen tonight shot dead the executive editor of an Assamese daily that had been advocating talks between the Ulfa and the government.        
	Anil Majumdar, the executive editor of Aji (Today), was shot by a group of youths near his residence on Rajgarh Road, police sources said.         
	Majumdar, in his late thirties, was attacked as he opened the gate of his house on his way back from office.        
	The assailants, who came in a car, pumped seven bullets into Majumdars chest and sped away before police could reach the spot.        
	Majumdar had started his journalistic career as a part-time correspondent of another local daily.         
	He later took over as executive editor of the then defunct Aji and revived it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Coke with ageless Aamir
                                                                                                               Coke with ageless Aamir
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                              
	Mumbai, March 3: Ageing Shah Rukh, ageless Aamir.        
	Soft drink major Coke has signed up Aamir Khan for a new contract, weeks after ri- val Pepsi snapped ties with brand ambassador Shah Rukh Khan as the ageing star no longer fitted the image for its Youngistan campaign.        
	Aamir, 43, is a few months older than Shah Rukh, but has been riding high since the success of his film Ghajini.        
	Aamir is classy, ageless and not over-exposed. So while other stars of his generation are being dropped, he is going from strength to strength, said an official of a top celebrity talent management firm.        
	Aamir also managed Rs 10 crore from Coke for his new deal, Rs 6 crore more than SRKs contract with Pepsi that ended last November. SRK is an ageing star and does not fit the image any more, a source in PepsiCo said last month.        
	Sources in Coke said the company would soon shoot with Aamir a campaign expected to be aired during the coming IPL season.

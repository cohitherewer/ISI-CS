The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Slumdog setting for USs India thrust
                                                                                                               Slumdog setting for USs India thrust
          K.P. NAYAR                               
	Washington, June 15: Drawing inspiration from the political Oscar that went to Jai Ho, adopted by the Congress party in the Lok Sabha poll, Americans will tomorrow make Slumdog Millionaire the launching pad for their first high-level interaction with the new Indian government.        
	Ten days of intense engagement between the US and India will start at Newseum, this capital citys newest building that houses a media museum, tomorrow night when Indian diplomat Vikas Swarup, author of Q amp;A, which became Slumdog Millionaire, receives the US-India Business Councils (USIBC) 34th anniversary award for cultural ties that bind the two countries.        
	The award ceremony will be followed 14 hours later by a policy speech by US secretary of state Hillary Clinton, in which she is expected to unveil the Obama administrations agenda for India, now that a new government is firmly in place in New Delhi.        
	Clintons speech at the USIBCs Synergies Summit is widely expected to put to rest the gripe in India and sections of US opinion that the Obama administration has not been paying the attention due to India.        
	Swarup, who is Indias deputy high commissioner to South Africa, will receive the award for the authors contribution illuminating aspects of society that facilitate a deeper understanding and abiding respect for humanity, according to Ron Somers, president of USIBC.        
	Somers said American businessmen hoped to benefit by listening to Swarups experiences that produced his best-selling book about life in an Indian slum so that we as businessmen can think of how to deal with one another in a better way. The Synergies Summit will bring on one platform three members of any US presidents cabinet for the first time to push forward Indo-US relations, noted Kiran Pasricha, deputy director-general of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).        
	She said the CII was promptly responding to the US gesture by bringing a second team of Indian CEOs this week to interact with American businesses. A similar team was here in March, somewhat making up for the gap in bilateral interaction caused by the elections.        
	Normally we bring only one such team in a year. But this weeks delegation is the second in three months, Pasricha said. Among the Indian business leaders of at the Synergies Summit will be Azim Premji, Anil Ambani, the CIIs new president, Venu Srinivasan, and its chief mentor, Tarun Das. The new commerce minister, Anand Sharma, will also attend.        
	Wednesdays summit will set the stage for three or four cabinet visits from the US to India in the coming months, including Clinton, US trade representative Ron Kirk and commerce secretary Gary Locke, all of whom will address the USIBC.        
	We want President Obama to visit India in his first term itself, said Somers, if only to sway one fifth of the worlds population towards America.         
	Meanwhile, the other representative body of Indian businessmen, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci), is looking way beyond bilateral visits and speeches to the phase when an economic recovery in the US can propel Indo-US relations to an era of broader and deeper challenges.        
	Amit Mitra, Ficcis secretary-general, said an Indo-US report on looming opportunities for mutual economic gains while seeking to mitigate possible bilateral tensions as India assumes a larger role in the global economy will be released here during the visit of Indian MPs and Ficci leaders.        
	The visionary report, Charting new frontiers: Enhancing India-US Cooperation in the global innovation economy highlights opportunities, but also anticipates threats to the bilateral relationship from issues like protectionism, in a way, for instance, the Japanese did not anticipate with their car exports to the US almost three decades ago, resulting in tensions not only between their governments, but also their ethnic communities in the US.        
	Mitra, who co-chaired a task force along with former US ambassador to India, Richard Celeste, that produced the report, said the events next week would see a multi-pronged effort in Washington by India to simultaneously tap opportunities in the political domain, business domain and intellectual domain.        
	He said we will be walking on four legs with MPs interacting with US legislators, business to business contacts, think tank to think tank meetings and a combination where all three intersect in what is turning out to be the biggest promotional 10 days for India since the celebrations in New York on the 60th anniversary of Indian independence in 2007.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mistimed pullout finger at Karat
                                                                                                               Mistimed pullout finger at Karat
          JAYANTH JACOB                                            
	New Delhi, June 21: The CPM leadership faced criticism at the partys central committee meeting today, with some members saying a mistimed withdrawal of support to the UPA government and the lack of an effective follow-up plan led to the electoral debacle.        
	Most members endorsed the opposition to the nuclear deal, sources claimed. Many, however, felt the party didnt time the pullout well, and this had three adverse results. One, the nuclear deal went through; two, the government survived; and three, the CPM failed to make any electoral gains out of it.        
	(A central committee member from Bengal claimed that Prakash Karat admitted the withdrawal of support was not correct, our special correspondent in Calcutta reports. But CPM sources in Delhi refused to confirm this version.)        
	The way the withdrawal took place and the absence of a cohesive plan to face the fallout politically were factors in our poor show in the polls, a member said after the two-day meeting.        
	Many members felt the CPM leadership had failed to bring the third front parties on a policy platform that could have given credibility to the alliance. When the UPA government was taking anti-people measures at the early stage and we protested, we had support from many parties. But we couldnt put up a formidable front based on programmes before the elections and that was a certain failure, the member said, adding that building alternatives takes time and requires struggles and movements.        
	According to a report submitted by Bengal CPM secretary Biman Bose on the proceedings of a state committee meeting where Karat was present, 52 members had spoken, of whom five blamed national factors for the poll setback. Of the five, only three referred to the withdrawal of support as a reason, the sources claimed.        
	At Fridays politburo meeting, the CPM central leaderships report had pointed at state factors for the magnitude of the poll defeats in Bengal and Kerala.        
	Some members today felt the central leadership was not taking effective steps to address the Kerala factionalism.

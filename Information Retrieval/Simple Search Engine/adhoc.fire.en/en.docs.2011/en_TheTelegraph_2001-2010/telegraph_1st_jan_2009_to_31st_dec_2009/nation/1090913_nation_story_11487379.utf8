The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CJI tough on graft
                                                                                                               CJI tough on graft
                            
	New Delhi, Sept. 12 (PTI): The Chief Justice of India today favoured statutory provisions for seizure of illegal properties and assets of government officials convicted in corruption cases.        
	Justice K.G. Balakrishnan also recommended specialised teams of lawyers to ensure that they would progressively develop expertise in prosecuting corruption cases.        
	If a public official amasses wealth at the cost of public, then the state is justified in seizing such assets, Balakrishnan said at a national seminar on fighting crimes related to corruption.        
	One prominent suggestion is the inclusion of a statutory remedy that will enable confiscation of properties belonging to persons who are convicted of offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act, the chief justice said.        
	The CJI said delays over sanction for prosecution and the difficulties in marshalling witnesses were the major hurdles to conviction.

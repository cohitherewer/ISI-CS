	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 16: A joint team of CRPF and SOG personnel that swooped on Gajulkonda village in Malkangiri district to nab a rebel leader, came back empty-handed after facing the wrath of tribal villagers instead.         
	Villagers armed with traditional weapons came out to help the leader escape into the woods before the personnel could nab him. The incident took place 15km from Kalimela police station.        
	After receiving a tip-off we had planned to raid the village, but villagers helped him to escape, said superintendent of police Satyabrata Bhoi, refusing to disclose the identity of the leader. The raid team arrested 11 villagers, suspected rebel sympathisers, said Bhoi.         
	In Rayagada, Gudari police arrested three suspected rebels and began interrogating them. The three, Sitaram Jagarangi, Kuduka Kalungu and Kiru Jagaranga were caught after a two-day search conducted by a joint team of CRPF, SOG and local police.        
	Now they have launched a search in Karlaghati region to flush out more rebels.         
	On Wednesday, there were reports of three rebels being killed in the encounter.

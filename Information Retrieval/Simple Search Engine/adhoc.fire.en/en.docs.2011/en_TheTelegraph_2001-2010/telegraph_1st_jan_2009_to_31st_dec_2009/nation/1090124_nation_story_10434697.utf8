The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Kazakh date off, Aussie put off
                                                                                                               Kazakh date off, Aussie put off
          JAYANTH JACOB                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 23: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will not be able to host several dignitaries because of his bypass surgery, besides missing an initiative he has been keen on  a uranium deal with Kazakhstan.        
	Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who reached Delhi tonight, is the chief guest at this years Republic Day parade.        
	Singh, likely to be out of action for about two weeks after coronary artery bypass graft surgery tomorrow, will also miss meeting his Australian counterpart Kevin Rudd.        
	The Australian leader, scheduled to meet Singh on January 28, has deferred his visit, sources in the foreign ministry here have confirmed.        
	Government sources, however, said even if Rudd had not deferred his trip, he could have called on Singh unofficially.        
	Nazarbayev, too, can call on Singh for a private visit if he wants to.        
	The surgery will also put on hold Singhs already twice-postponed plan to visit Saudi Arabia. The 76-year-old leader was looking at a February date to visit the Gulf country, where he would have met Saudi king Abdullah bin Abdulaziz al-Saud.        
	The sources said the surgery could also affect schedules of other dignitaries hoping for an audience with Singh.         
	They said missions abroad have been generally indicated that when it comes to foreign leaders seeking appointment with Singh, they should take into account the Prime Ministers medical status for the time being.         
	The visit of the Kazakh President is important for India, which hopes to tap uranium supplies from the Central Asian country to fuel its ambitious civil nuclear programme.        
	Kazakhstan has 15 per cent of the worlds uranium deposits and is aiming for an annual production of 15,000 tonnes by 2010 and 30,000 tonnes by 2018.        
	With Australia, home to some 40 per cent of the worlds uranium deposits, insisting that India join the nuclear non-proliferation regime, Kazakhstan, the sources said, was a viable alternative.        
	Nazarbayev, the first Central Asian head of state to be the chief guest at a Republic Day parade, will be accompanied by foreign minister Marat Tazhin and a high-level delegation, including Kazakh business captains.         
	The two sides are expected to sign agreements on protection of intellectual property rights and several trade pacts, the sources said.

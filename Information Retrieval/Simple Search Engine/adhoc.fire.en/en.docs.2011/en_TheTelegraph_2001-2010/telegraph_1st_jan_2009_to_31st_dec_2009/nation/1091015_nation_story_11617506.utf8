The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cops held for MBA death
                                                                                                               Cops held for MBA death
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Lucknow, Oct. 14: The CBI today arrested four Dehra Dun policemen in connection with the alleged fake encounter of an MBA student on the eve of the Presidents visit to the town in July.        
	Four more policemen are under the scanner and could be held soon for killing Ghaziabads Ranbir Singh, CBI officials said. The cops, among the 14 named in the FIR and booked on murder charges, had claimed that the 22-year-old snatched an officers revolver during a routine highway check on July 3, a day before President Pratibha Patils arrival.        
	Those held today were G.D. Bhatt, a sub-inspector whose revolver Ranbir was accused of snatching, Nitin Chauhan, head of the special operations group present at the encounter site, and constables Palu Ajit Singh and Santosh Jaiswal, who fired at Ranbir.        
	The arrests mark the beginning of the process of arresting the accused policemen. We may make more arrests over the next few days, said a CBI officer.         
	The CBI action followed Uttarakhand High Courts rejection on Monday of an appeal by a section of the accused officers for a stay on the probe. Six of the 14 cops have agreed to be approvers for the prosecution and testify against their colleagues.         
	The CBI is said to have a watertight case. The post-mortem report has indicated that Ranbir was shot from close range, an officer said.        
	Also, not a single round was fired from the revolver that the police claimed Ranbir had snatched. If the victim never fired, as claimed, how could the cops on duty justify his killing in cold blood? asked a member of the CBI team.        
	The revolver, hidden by Bhatt near the encounter site in the Ladpur jungles on the outskirts of Dehra Dun, was recovered last month.         
	The discovery followed the questioning of Ram Kumar and Ashok Kumar, Ranbirs friends who were going with him to Dehra Dun on bikes. The two youths escaped the police shooting.        
	A crucial eyewitness for the CBI was Pervez Anjum, a resident of Dalanwala, near the encounter spot, who had been declared missing by the police since July 3.        
	The CBI concluded that the cops cooked up the revolver-snatching story after killing Ranbir to mislead senior officers.        
	The then Dehra Dun superintendent of police was removed and six other policemen benched in the wake of the public outrage that followed Ranbirs killing.

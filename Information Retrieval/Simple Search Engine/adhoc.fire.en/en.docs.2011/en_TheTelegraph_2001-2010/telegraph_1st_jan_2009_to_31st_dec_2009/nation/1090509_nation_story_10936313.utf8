                                                                                                               BJD breaks ally silence
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Naveen Patnaik with Prakash Karat in Bhubaneswar on Friday. Pix: Sanjib Mukherjee                                  
	Bhubaneswar, May 8: CPI general secretary Prakash Karat today asserted that the Third Front would make a bid for a non-Congress and a non-BJP government at the Centre after the Lok Sabha polls.         
	Our assessment is that our combination is strong enough to form a non-Congress and non-BJP government in Delhi, Karat told reporters after meeting chief minister and BJD boss Naveen Patnaik this afternoon.         
	However, the leader evaded questions on whether the Third Front would seek support from the Congress if it fell short of a majority to form the government at the Centre. Wait for the results, he said.         
	We are hopeful that other non-Congress secular parties will come to our fold. We have made an appeal to all non-Congress and non-BJP parties to come together, added Karat, hinting at a possible tie-up with JD(U).         
	He reminded the media people that on March 15, the CPM and nine parties had met Mayavati in New Delhi and had issued a joint statement regarding post-poll possibilities. After the results we will work together to form a secular government at the Centre, he added again.         
	In Orissa, too, non-Congress and non-BJP parties had come together to jointly fight the elections and had resolved to form a secular government both at the Centre as well as in the state.         
	Our alliance, led by the BJD, is poised to form a government in Orissa. We will like Naveen Patnaik to be the chief minister for the third term and play a role in the formation of a secular government at the Centre, he said.         
	Naveen, who stood beside the Left leader throughout the meet, reiterated his partys stand of not supporting any government headed by the Congress or the BJP. Our combination is in a position to provide an alternative government, said the BJD chief. On the eve of the Lok Sabha and Assembly polls, BJD had entered into a seat adjustment with CPI, CPM and NCP and broke its 11-year alliance with BJP. However, Naveen till date has been evading questions on its relationship with the front.         
	However, today, the BJD boss conceded that his party was indeed in the Third Front. As we are not going to support the BJP or the Congress, we are obviously with them (Third Front) and thats why he (Karat) has come here.         
	Talking about Delhi chief minister Shiela Dikshits hint of a possible post-poll tie-up between Congress and non-BJP parties, Naveen said: Im surprised. It shows how desperate they are for support. But, it (support) will certainly not come from the BJD.

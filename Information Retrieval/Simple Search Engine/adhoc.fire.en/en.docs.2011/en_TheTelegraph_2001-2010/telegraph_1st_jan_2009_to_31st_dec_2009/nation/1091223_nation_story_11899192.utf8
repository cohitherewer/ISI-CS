The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Veil off deep ragging roots
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Veil off deep ragging roots
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, Dec 22: The scale of ragging in higher education may have been vastly underestimated, feedback from the first anti-ragging helpline has suggested, pushing the government into fast-tracking plans to monitor action on each complaint.        
	The helpline (1800-180-5522), launched nationally by human resource development minister Kapil Sibal on June 19, received 316 complaints by mid-November, data available with the ministry and accessed by The Telegraph show.         
	The complaint tally is over three times the number of ragging-related cases, 88, collated over the 2008-09 academic session by an anti-ragging group and used by the ministry in assessing the extent of the problem.         
	The session starts mid-June at most institutions, and first-year students usually face ragging from seniors during the initial months.        
	The number of complaints we have received confirms a nagging fear many of us had  that the statistics collated till now did not capture the extent of the phenomenon, a source said.        
	The helpline has been publicised by the ministry in advertisements but officials estimate that the majority of students may be unaware of the facility.        
	Many students  even among those who know about the helpline  may choose not to use the facility, officials said, explaining that the actual number of ragging cases is likely to be significantly higher than 316.        
	The ministry is now pushing plans to institutionalise a mechanism that will allow the government to monitor follow-up action by college authorities on each complaint registered with the helpline.        
	At present, the moment a complaint is received, helpline managers alert the head of the institution.        
	Under anti-ragging regulations enforced by the University Grants Commission (UGC), each institution must immediately send a designated team to the site of the alleged ragging.         
	The team either tries to prevent the incident or to assist the victim while gathering evidence against the alleged culprit. The evidence and the teams report are used to initiate an inquiry and punish any guilty student.        
	But the helpline  the fountainhead of the measures  is not accompanied by an independent monitoring mechanism to ensure the authorities follow up on the complaints as required under the UGC regulations.        
	The concern is that unless we can ensure timely intervention by the college authorities and prompt action against any guilty student, the helpline will become meaningless, an official said.         
	Educational Consultants India Ltd (EdCIL), a public sector consultancy firm under the Centre which is managing the helpline, is finalising plans to set up an anti-ragging NGO to help monitor action on the complaints, sources said.        
	The government is also preparing a charter of rules that will need to be followed by monitors. The ministry, officials said, plans to put in place the monitoring mechanism in time for the start of the 2010-11 session.

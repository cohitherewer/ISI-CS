The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PM calls Nitish on cash 
                                                                                                               PM calls Nitish on cash 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Manmohan, Nitish: Patch-up time?                          
	New Delhi, May 12: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today called up Nitish Kumar to clear the air, a day after he voiced doubts over the Bihar chief ministers secular credentials.        
	It was a gracious gesture, a Congress source said, rejecting suggestions that the phone call was part of a desperate bid to reach out to as many potential allies as possible before the May 16 verdict.        
	In a democracy, theres nothing called desperation. Its about arithmetic and the UPA and the NDA have plunged into the game of totting up numbers. Its logical that he (Singh) should try and win over new friends.        
	Yesterday, at a rally in Ludhiana, Singh had said a doubt did arise in his mind when Nitish shook hands with Narendra Modi at an NDA show of strength a day earlier in the Punjab city. In Patna, Nitish had retorted that he did not need a certificate of secularism from Singh.        
	In Ludhiana, Singh had also disputed Nitishs allegation at the May 10 rally that 20 minutes after the last vote had been polled in the Kosi region on April 30, the Centre had demanded that Bihar return every paisa of the relief amount disbursed last year for the flood-ravaged belt.        
	Deepak Sandhu, Singhs media adviser, today said the phone conversation was broadly about the flood relief funds. I dont know if other issues were discussed.        
	Nitish echoed Sandhu and said the Prime Minister had called about the row over the Rs 1,000-crore Kosi flood relief package. He (Singh) said he will re-look the complete matter and added that he had ordered the cabinet secretary... this is what he told me on the phone, PTI quoted the chief minister as saying.        
	Asked if any political issue was discussed, Nitish said: All else is your speculation and the bare fact is this. This was our complaint and he will have a re-look. This is in the interest of Bihar and not in my personal interest.        
	Congress sources said a message had been sent from top down that no party and their leaders, except those of the BJP and the Shiv Sena, should be criticised.        
	We assume everybody has got the message and knows what their mandate is, a party functionary said, but did not say if the Prime Minister had been nudged to make up with Nitish.        
	The sources conceded that the NDAs show of strength on Sunday had been a wake-up call for the Congress to get its house in order before May 16.        
	In Uttar Pradesh, they said, leaders identified as being soft on Mayavati had begun working the wires with BSP mediators after word got around that the BJP was already on the job.        
	Unlike Nitish, who heads a government with BJP support, Mayavati has no such compulsion, a Congress source said. She will go with the party that accepts most of her conditions.         
	BSP sources said Mayavati was focused on the last phase of polls tomorrow and hadnt spared a thought yet for the Congress, the BJP or the third front.

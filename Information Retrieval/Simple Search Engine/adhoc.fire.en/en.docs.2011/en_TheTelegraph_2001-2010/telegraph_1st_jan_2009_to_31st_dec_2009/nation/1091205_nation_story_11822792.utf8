  - Chhattisgarh gets bullet-proof jacket nod          SHEENA K.                          Jawans in a Maoist zone without bullet-proof jackets. Now, they will be better protected                                        
	Raipur, Dec. 4: The Chhattisgarh government has received consent from the Union ministry of home affairs to purchase bullet-proof jackets for the jawans taking on Maoists.        
	Last year, the state government mooted a proposal to purchase bullet-proof jackets for the security personnel. But the proposal could not take shape as the government sought custom duty exemption on the material imported for making the jackets.        
	Sources said the state government wanted high-quality jackets that could withstand even when bullets sprayed from AK-47 or other sophisticated weapons. To manufacturer such jackets, the companies would require to import materials.        
	The state government urged the Union ministry of home affairs to ensure exemption of custom duty on the materials so that the company that had bagged the contract could save money. The aim was to reduce manufacturing cost that would help the state to procure more jackets at the budget fixed for it.        
	Sources said a Bangalore-based firm had bagged the contract for manufacturing and supplying the jackets to the Chhattisgarh police. But the deal was put on hold as the state authorities were waiting a nod from the Union ministry of home affairs to purchase the jackets after exemption of custom duty.        
	The state government has received the letter from the ministry in connection with the exemption of custom duty and purchase of bullet-proof jackets, inspector-general of police (headquarters) R.K. Vij told The Telegraph. The government will soon start the process to procure the jackets, he added.        
	With the stipulated budget, the state government plans to purchase more than 3,000 high-quality bullet-proof jackets for the security personnel on field duty. The development adds significance as the state is planning to launch attack on the rebels to flush out the Maoists from its territory.

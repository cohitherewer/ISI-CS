The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | What if Bengal votes same way in Assembly? Mamata can be CM   Pure math says chair in reach
                                                                                                               What if Bengal votes same way in Assembly? Mamata can be CM     Pure math says chair in reach
          ANINDYA SENGUPTA                                                
	Calcutta, May 16: Come 2011 Assembly elections in Bengal, the Congress-Trinamul alliance could well get close to two-thirds of the seats if the Lok Sabha election results repeat themselves.         
	It also sets off a year-long, anxious wait for the ruling Left to find out whether it would be able to retain the Calcutta Municipal Corporation in next years polls, given that the front lost both the Calcutta Lok Sabha seats and all the Assembly segments in the metropolis.         
	Having increased Trinamuls tally from one Lok Sabha seat in the 2004 parliamentary polls (Mamata being the only elected Trinamul MP then) that the party fought in alliance with the BJP, the Trinamul leader has posted victories in 20 Lok Sabha seats (including SUCIs one) with the Congress claiming six.        
	Given that each parliamentary constituency comprises seven Assembly seats, Trinamuls Lok Sabha tally may technically translate into 140 seats in 2011, while the Congresss six would work out to 42 Assembly seats. Add to this BJP-won Darjeelings seven Assembly segments and the tally of the Opposition can come to 189 in the 2011 polls  41 more than the magic figure to form the government at Writers Buildings and seven short of two-thirds majority in the 294-member Bengal Assembly.        
	Its true that we underestimated the potential of the Congress-Trinamul seat adjustment, given our experience in the 2001 Assembly polls when they fought together but came a cropper. But the alliance got cemented this time because of Singur and Nandigram. If we cant regain lost ground, the Congress-Trinamul alliance can get around 190-200 seats in the 2011 Assembly polls, a CPM central committee member said today.        
	The Left had got 35 of the 42 parliamentary seats in 2004, following it up with 235 seats in the 2006 Assembly polls  merely 10 seats less than the expected figure of 245 (35x7).         
	However, all this can only happen if conditions remain the same and Mamata maintains her land campaign for the next two years, said a Trinamul general secretary.        
	Two years is a long time in politics and much can change, cautioned the CPM central committee member. So, it is not necessary that these results will get translated into Assembly seats for Trinamul.         
	Leader of the Opposition Partha Chatterjee said: We have to be cautious and concentrate on organisation work to ensure a change of guard in 2011. We are sure Mamata will carry on her land agitation.         
	Besides the Lok sabha drubbing, no less worrisome for the CPM is its social disconnect with the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes across Bengal.        
	Of the 76 scheduled caste and scheduled tribe Assembly seats in the state  around 25 per cent of the total Assembly seats  the Left had got 70 in the 2006 Assembly polls.        
	This time, the total number of SC and ST seats has gone up to 87  nearly 30 per cent of the Assembly strength  of which Left presence has become uncertain in 46 seats, given todays Congress-Trinamul Lok Sabha outcome.        
	As for the fallout on the states political geography, Trinamul has succeeded in changing the scenario in south Bengal by making major inroads into Left strongholds.        
	In the 2006 Assembly polls, Trinamul and Congress had got 30 and 25 seats respectively, though without an alliance. Had there been one, the parties would have got 67 additional seats, arithmetic says. In 2006, Trinamul had won around 19 of the 96 seats in Nadia, North 24-Parganas, South 24-Parganas, Howrah and Burdwan.         
	Three seats in Birbhum and Burdwan and eight in Calcutta proper made up its poor 2006 Assembly tally.        
	This time, Trinamuls geographical spread is evident from the ruptures it has caused in Left bastions like Dum Dum, Basirhat, Bongaon, Barrackpore and Barasat  spread across 33 Assembly constituencies in North 24-Parganas.        
	Similarly, Trinamul and SUCI victories in all the four Lok Sabha seats in South 24-Parganas is cause for major concern for the CPM, said a CPM state committee member.         
	It will be premature to say we will lose all the 30 Assembly seats in South 24-Parganas in 2011. But todays defeat is disturbing since we had fought well in Joynagar and Jadavpur but failed, he added.

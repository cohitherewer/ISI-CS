	New Delhi, April 28 (PTI): The Supreme Court today set up a high-powered committee for scientific research to solve the countrys water problem.         
	Justice Markandeya Katju said the government had no right to be in office if it couldnt provide water.        
	The research would focus on converting saline seawater into fresh water through inexpensive methods, the court said.

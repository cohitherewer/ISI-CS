The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Relief in Delhi as US signals shift on nuke red rag
                                                                                                               Relief in Delhi as US signals shift on nuke red rag
          K.P. NAYAR                          Obama: Sensitive to India                                  
	Washington, April 7: The speech was delivered in Prague. But its echoes are being felt in New Delhi.        
	In his declaration to lead a global effort to eliminate all nuclear weapons, US President Barack Obama has signalled that he intends to deal with India with sensitivity and that a bilateral relationship cherished by his predecessors Bill Clinton and George W. Bush will not be squandered for any ideology.        
	Obama said on Sunday that my administration will immediately and aggressively pursue US ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, but for New Delhi, his remarks on the red rag of CTBT were significant for the Presidents own words earlier that he ate in Pragues Hradany Square before a 20,000-plus crowd.        
	In a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh before occupying the White House, Obama had explicitly said: I will work with the US Senate to secure ratification of the international treaty banning nuclear weapons testing at the earliest practical day, and then launch a major diplomatic initiative to ensure its entry into force.        
	Significantly missing from his speech in Prague were any references to a major diplomatic initiative  of which India would have been an obvious target  and efforts to ensure its entry into force.        
	The CTBT cannot enter into force until India and a few other nuclear-capable countries accede to the treaty.        
	There is relief on Raisina Hill, the seat of power in New Delhi, that Obama has gone back on his threat in the letter to Singh to make an example of India in his efforts to promote nuclear non-proliferation.        
	In his letter, Obama had actually lectured Singh on Indias nuclear ambitions. With the benefits of nuclear co-operation come real responsibilities  and that should include steps to restrain nuclear weapons programs and pursuing effective disarmament when others do so, one portion of the letter read.        
	For these reasons, the Indian government, which excitedly rushes to the media even when there is a short phone call from the White House or the State Department, had suppressed Obamas letter.        
	The sensitivity shown by the US President in Prague in not being a bully on CTBT also reflects a realisation after coming to power that cooperation  not confrontation  with India is what he needs if Obamas goal of universal nuclear disarmament is to be advanced.        
	In the light of what Obama said and did not say in Prague on Sunday, his personnel choices on non-proliferation now make sense.        
	The White House was to have chosen Robert Einhorn, often described here as an ayatollah of non-proliferation, to be the under-secretary of state for arms control and international security.        
	But the President and the secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, changed their minds and chose Ellen Tauscher, a Democratic Congresswoman from California, for the post some three weeks ago.        
	Like Einhorn, Tauscher also opposed the Indo-US nuclear deal and in the Congress, she voted against the so-called 123 Agreement enabling the deal and for amendments to the Agreement that were aimed at curbing Indias nuclear programmes.        
	It is now clear that while the Obama administration had to choose someone who had a record of having actively worked to advance non-proliferation, Tauscher was chosen because she was a politician who could be flexible unlike Einhorn, a stubborn strategic thinker.        
	Like Obama in Prague, the California politician can be expected to show flexibility in dealings with India under political direction from Obama and Clinton.        
	A lot, of course, depends on India. Notwithstanding Obamas realpolitik in handling New Delhi, the Indians will get nothing from the US administrations guardians of non-proliferation unless they put their foot down in future nuclear negotiations and are ready to fight.        
	A big challenge will unfold almost immediately after the new government is sworn in after the Lok Sabha elections.        
	The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is due to come up for review at the UN next year. Obama said on Sunday that together, we will strengthen the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as a basis for cooperation.        
	The next government will have to quickly decide on what its attitude towards the global NPT review will be. Especially since India will have no presence at the review conference since it is not a signatory to the treaty.

	Kochi, Oct. 16 (PTI): An eagle hit an Air India plane and got trapped in the propeller as the aircraft was landing at Nedumbassery airport here today, sources said.         
	Flight IC-537, with 31 passengers on board, landed safely.        
	The plane was heading to Kozhikode from Dubai. It was diverted to Kochi because of bad weather in Kozhikode.        
	After repairs, the Air India plane resumed its journey to Kozhikode, the sources said.         
	Another Air India flight made an emergency landing at Vishakhapatnam airport yesterday after developing a technical snag. The 162 passengers on the Delhi-Chennai flight reached their destination today.

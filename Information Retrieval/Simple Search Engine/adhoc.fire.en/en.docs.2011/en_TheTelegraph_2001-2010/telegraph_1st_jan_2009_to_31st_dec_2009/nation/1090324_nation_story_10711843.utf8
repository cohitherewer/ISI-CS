	Jaipur, March 23: Thirty-five years after Sonar Kella, help is at hand for any Bengali tourist caught in an emergency in Rajasthan.        
	If Satyajit Rays film brought the desert state closer to the Bengali imagination, the Rajasthan chapter of the Rajasthan Bengal Maitri Parishad, inaugurated here yesterday, looks to bind the Bengalis and Marwaris together in more practical ways.        
	It wants to not only improve cultural, economic and social ties between the two states but also help their tourists in distress. For example, if a Bengali visiting Rajasthan has an accident and needs blood, the parishad will try to arrange for it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Arjun friends CBSE chair in limbo
                                                                                                               Arjun friends CBSE chair in limbo
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           Arjun: Friend bother                                  
	New Delhi, March 25: The personnel ministry has stalled the appointment of a new chairperson to the Central Board of Secondary Education, raising questions over the procedure used to pick a friend of education minister Arjun Singh for the post.         
	It has asked Arjuns ministry to clarify why standard selection norms were flouted in selecting IPS officer Pragya Srivastava, the ministers friend, as a candidate for the post.         
	The move by the personnel and training department follows concerns raised by segments of Indias school administration system and other aspirants to the CBSE chairpersons post over the selection process followed by the HRD ministry.         
	The HRD ministrys deviation from standard procedures was reported first by The Telegraph on March 15.         
	Srivastava, a joint commissioner in charge of administration at the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan, and two others were shortlisted by a selection committee without any interviews for potential candidates.         
	Interviews of candidates for top government posts are not mandated by law. But the norms followed routinely, even at the HRD ministry, require a search committee to hold such interviews before drawing up a shortlist.         
	From the shortlist of the three, Arjun approved Srivastavas name and forwarded it to the department of personnel and training in a sealed envelope, triggering questions of propriety. Arjun had handpicked the selection committee earlier.         
	Arjun has recommended that the appointments committee of the cabinet (ACC), headed by the Prime Minister, approve Srivastava for the post. Appointments to top posts in the government and central autonomous bodies are made by the ACC.         
	But personnel ministry sources said they were not keen on approaching the ACC for its approval at present because of the concerns raised over Srivastavas selection.         
	The concerns raised appear prima facie to carry legitimacy but the HRD ministry may be able to successfully clarify the reasons behind its departure from standard procedures, a source said.         
	For the moment, however, the process is stalled, the source added.         
	An embarrassed HRD ministry is likely to stick to its selection arguing that the norms it allegedly violated were not rules binding it.         
	There has been no breach of any rule. Yes, the selection was hurried but all that was mandatory was followed, a ministry official argued.         
	Srivastava and her husband, an IPS officer from the Madhya Pradesh cadre, have known Arjun since his days as chief minister in Bhopal in the 1980s, sources close to the minister said.         
	As recently as last month, an HRD ministry selection committee had interviewed several candidates for the post of vice-chancellor for 15 new central universities before finalising its recommendations.         
	The CBSE chairmans selection, too, has always involved interviews in the past. In 2000, former chairman Ashok Ganguly was chosen after interviews of several shortlisted candidates.         
	When Gangulys term ended in August 2008, a selection committee set up to recommend his successor interviewed potential candidates and arrived at the decision that none of the applicants was suitable.

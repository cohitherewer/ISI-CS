                                                                                                               Banking on Varun 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Raipur, April 1: BJP leaders are now banking on Sanjay Gandhis son Varun to ride on the popular Hindutva wave in the ensuing election, admitted some party leaders.         
	Varuns father Sanjay Gandhi had hogged the headlines during the emergency declared in 1975 for all wrong reasons. And wrong decisions taken by him as Indira Gandhis adviser helped the Opposition, Janata Party, to trounce the Congress in the post-emergency elections and form the government at the Centre.         
	Now, that Sanjays son is behind the bars for his inflammatory speeches, BJP president Rajnath Singh today claimed that an emergency-like situation had been created in the country.         
	Never in Indias history, has any politician been harassed in such a way for violating the election code of conduct, Singh said in Raipur.         
	The UPA government in nexus with Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati has created an emergency-like situation in the country by taking such harsh action against Varun, he said, denying that they were looking forward to getting the same benefits from this emergency as they did from the earlier one.         
	But the BJP president hinted that the party would launch a nation-wide campaign. I am reaching Delhi on Friday and a high-level meeting has been convened to see what can be done (on the issue of Varuns arrest), Singh said, adding that senior party leader Venkaiah Naidu has asked to go to Etah jail on Thursday to meet Varun. Singh said that the BJP would stand by Varun Gandhi.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Another statue rap on Maya
                                                                                                               Another statue rap on Maya
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 5: The Supreme Court today slammed the Mayawati government for circumventing its orders to stop all work on memorials and statues by trying to pass off some of the constructions as cleaning.         
	Dont play games like (you do) with the political Opposition in the Assembly. You are treating this court like an adversary, the court told the Uttar Pradesh government counsel.        
	The judges rejected the states argument that construction was under way only outside 75 acres of the 105 acres where the disputed memorials and statues were coming up. The government undertaking (not to carry out any work) was in respect of all properties, the judges pointed out .        
	Told only cleaning was being done, they shot back: Who authorised the cleaning work? The judges said as a prudent government, it should have put down the hammer and chisel and sought permission for any type of work.        
	The court said it would hear the state at length tomorrow. If the judges are not satisfied, the government will face contempt action.         
	A Lucknow residents association has challenged Mayavatis memorial and statue-building spree on environmental grounds and alleged misuse of public money. Today, the associations lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi accused the government of playing ducks and drakes.

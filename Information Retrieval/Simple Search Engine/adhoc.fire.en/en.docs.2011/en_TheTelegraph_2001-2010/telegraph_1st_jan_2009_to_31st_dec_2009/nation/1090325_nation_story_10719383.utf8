                                                                                                               Red battlefield ready in Bihar
          GAUTAM SARKAR                              
	Jamui (Bihar), March 24: The men in khaki are ready for an unprecedented battle with rebel stronghold Jamui being announced a separate Lok Sabha seat.        
	In its recent report, the intelligence bureau noted that the rebels might strike before and during the poll in Jamui on April 16. Police outposts in forest areas had become particularly soft targets for the Naxalites, who enjoyed an edge in guerrilla attack in the hill corridors, it said. Besides, the report also proposed special alert for railway security personnel on the Kiul-Asansol section of Eastern Railway.        
	Jamui  created after delimitation process  has six Assembly segments  Chakai, Jhajha, Jamui, Sikendra (all in Jamui district), Tarapur (Munger) and Seikhpura (Seikhpura).        
	Topographically, Maoist-hit Jamui  which has over 13 lakh voters  is highly inaccessible as the hills with forest covers surround it from all the sides. It shares borders with Jharkhands Giridih and Deoghar districts and the rebels use the advantages of the borders for hideouts.        
	Jamui superintendent of police Binoy Kumar, however, appeared confident to take on the Naxalites before the polls. He said that the district had sufficient security personnel and special combing operation would be started soon with air-surveillance for peaceful polling process.         
	Kumar, who recently participated in a high-level inter-state police meet at Deoghar with Jharkhand police, said the neighbouring state had assured them to extend all support.        
	Amit Kumar, the deputy inspector general of police (Munger range) echoed Kumar and said all the booths would be under tight security covers.         
	Maoists nabbed        
	Shankar Yadav, alleged to be a Maoist area commander, was arrested during a raid in the Chandauti police station area on Monday night. Raj Bhallabh, a school student said to be a fresh recruit of the outfit, was also arrested.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Karat amp;   Co stand   up for Vijayan
                                                                                                               Karat amp;   Co stand   up for Vijayan

	Thiruvananthapuram, Jan. 30: Prakash Karat has re-affirmed his support to the Kerala CPM secretary in the Lavalin scam as a state minister suggested the post-Pokhran sanctions had choked the flow of aid promised by a Canadian firm.        
	Writing in party newspaper Deshabhimani, general secretary Karat iterated the CPM position that the CBI case against Pinarayi Vijayan was politically motivated. Attacking Vijayan and targeting the party was the fallout of the CPMs consistent fight against imperialism and reactionary economic policies, Karat said.        
	Vijayan has been accused of bypassing procedure and showing ugly haste as power minister in awarding the contract for modernisation of three hydel plants to Lavalin, which had promised aid for a cancer centre.        
	Karats defence of Vijayan came a day before he and three other politburo members visit the state and three days after chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan said he would abide by the Constitution in deciding whether to permit the CBI to prosecute Vijayan, his long-time party rival.        
	Today, posters appeared in Kozhikode urging Karat not to attend a lunch being hosted by a local businessman, described as a friend of Vijayan. Party sources denied any such lunch was planned before activists tore down the posters. Karat, Sitaram Yechury, S. Ramachandran Pillai and K. Varadharajan are to address a farmers rally in Wayanad district. The visit is likely to help them assess the situation after the chief ministers reservations on backing Vijayan.        
	Education minister M.A. Baby, who claimed the 1998 Pokhran test had choked the Lavalin aid, also made his observations in the party paper. Baby, a CPM central committee member, said the promised Rs 96 crore did not arrive because of the global sanctions imposed after the nuclear test. The scam was alleged to have taken place in 1996.         
	Lavalin, Baby said, had given Rs 12 crore for the first phase of the cancer centre during the tenure of the Left government headed by E.K. Nayanar. But the Congress-led regimes (of A.K. Antony and Oommen Chandy) failed to renew the pact with Lavalin and get the rest of the aid, Baby said. He added that not a paisa was paid to the Canadian firm during Vijayans tenure.

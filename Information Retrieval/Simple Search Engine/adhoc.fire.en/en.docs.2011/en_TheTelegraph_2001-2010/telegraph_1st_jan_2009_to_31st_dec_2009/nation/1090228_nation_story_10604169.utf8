The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Flip-flop on Kasab route
                                                                                                               Flip-flop on Kasab route
          NASIR JAFFRY AND AGENCIES                              
	Islamabad, Feb. 27: Pakistan Navy chief Admiral Noman Bashir today claimed he had no evidence that 26/11 terrorist Ajmal Kasab had headed for Mumbai from Pakistani territorial waters.         
	I have no evidence or information suggesting that Kasab entered India from Pakistani territorial waters, he said in Karachi, days ahead of the March 4 visit of an FBI team to Islamabad to help with the Mumbai attacks probe.        
	Bashirs contention contradicts interior ministry chief Rehman Maliks admission two weeks ago that the attacks were partly plotted in Pakistan and launched from its shores.         
	The evidence I have doesnt show that the terrorists went from this country. This is Indias claim from Day One. Even before the Mumbai incidents ended, India was saying the terrorists had used the sea route, Bashir said.        
	He wondered how the terrorists could have escaped the tight vigil of the Pakistan Navy guarding its coastline, and the Indian Navy after that.        
	If they evaded us and the Indian Navy, which is 10 times bigger than our navy, and cheated them along with the coast guard, which is 12 times bigger than our coast guard, what shall I say?        
	I dont want to make any more comments until I have seen some evidence. If Kasab reached Mumbai via our waters, the question is what were the Indian naval and maritime forces doing?        
	Hassan Askrai, a Pakistani defence analyst, said Bashirs statement made no sense after Pakistan had admitted that the attacks were partly planned in Pakistan.        
	It makes no sense and creates an impression that the military thinks differently from the civilian administration, he said.        
	Bashirs statements came on a day Pakistans special public prosecutor in the attacks case abruptly left for London for medical treatment.        
	Earlier, reports said Sardar Mohammad Ghazi had been fired for saying Islamabad had formally requested Delhi to hand over Kasab.        
	According to an official notification quoted by the Dawn News channel, Ghazi was also removed from the post of deputy attorney-general. The notification did not give any reason for the removal nor did it name a replacement.        
	The ouster came over a week after the lawyer claimed Kasab was the 26/11 prime suspect and that it would be difficult to prosecute the other accused arrested in Pakistan if he were not handed over.

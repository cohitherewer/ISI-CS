	New Delhi, July 3 (PTI): Nearly 20,000 Air India employees today defied a wage-cut threat and staged a walkout from work for two hours protesting delay in payment of salaries.        
	The protest, called by Aviation Industry Employees Guild and the Air Corporation Employees Union, saw employees coming out of their offices in Delhi and Mumbai to stage demonstrations from 1pm.        
	The government must pay our salaries by July 10. The company is taking decisions which are not in the interest of the employees, J.B. Kadiyan, general secretary of the aviation employees guild, said.        
	Airport officials said flight operations were not disrupted because of the strike.

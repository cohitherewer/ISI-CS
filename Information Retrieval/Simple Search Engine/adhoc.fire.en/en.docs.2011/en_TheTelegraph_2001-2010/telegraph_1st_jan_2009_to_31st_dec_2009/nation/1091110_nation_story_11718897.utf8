          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, Nov. 9: The Federation of All Orissa Traders Association today demanded a roll-back in the governments decision to regulate the purchase and sale of agriculture produces in the area under Regulated Market Committees (RMCs) across the state.        
	States co-operation department has issued a notification declaring its intention to regulate RMC market areas and the purchase and sale of fibres, cereals, pulses, oil seeds, tobacco, condiments and spices, sugarcane and jaggery, animal husbandry products, such as fish and grass and fodder and minor forest products.        
	The bid to regulate purchase and sale of agriculture produces in the RMC areas by invoking the Orissa Agricultural Produce market Act-1956 has the sole intention of imposing market fees on these items. This would lead to rise in prices, said B.K. Mohanty, the secretary of the trade association.         
	Mohanty added that their federation wrote to the chief minister, Naveen Patnaik, on behalf of consumers already reeling from sky rocketing prices who would be hit further. Sources said out of 1,250 primary and 76 wholesale markets existing in Orissa, only 30 per cent have been brought under regulation. The number of RMCs established across the state has been limited to 57.         
	The RMCs are already regulating purchase and sale of some items proposed for inclusion and collecting market fees, but without providing any services, Mohanty alleged in the memorandum, a copy of which was released to the media today.         
	The fees collected are being pilfered due to lack of proper management. The inclusion of almost all agricultural products would only increase the scope for pilferage, said the federation letter. The state would practically gain nothing, the secretary said.

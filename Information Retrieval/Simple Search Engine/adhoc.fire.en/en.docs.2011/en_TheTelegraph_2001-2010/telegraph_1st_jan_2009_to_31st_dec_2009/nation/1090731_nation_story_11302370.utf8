The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CPM revamp vs shuffle 
                                                                                                               CPM revamp vs shuffle 
          BISWAJIT ROY                          Bhattacharjee                                  
	Calcutta, July 30: As the CPM prepares to brainstorm over a course correction ahead of the 2011 Assembly polls, top government leaders appear to be resisting any ministry changes.        
	The CPM state secretariat today decided that the agenda paper for the August 1-2 state committee meeting will not mention a possible ministry shuffle. Instead, the committee will look into a revamp of the party organisation and a rectification campaign to win back traditional voters alienated (by) political, governmental and organisational factors.        
	Many in the party believe that injection of new blood (in the government) and dropping of poor performers would send a positive signal to voters. But many ministers, some of them state secretariat members, argue it would only vindicate Opposition charges.        
	There are different opinions about the changes needed in government. So well leave it to the floor, allowing committee members to suggest how to make the government more effective and pro-people, a secretariat member said.        
	CPM general secretary Prakash Karat will attend the crucial meeting. He will be in Calcutta tomorrow and is likely to meet the state leadership to fine-tune the committees agenda. Fellow politburo member S.R. Pillai, convener of the partys organisation-related committee, may join the discussions.        
	The agenda document will focus on policy imperatives, a source said. Karat, elaborating on the state-level factors for the poll rout, had cited farmers discontent over land acquisition. He had mentioned poor implementation of welfare projects and listed the public distribution system, health, education, rural electrification and drinking water supply as areas of major failures.        
	Party sources had said power and labour minister Mrinal Banerjee and parliamentary affairs and environment minister Sailen Sarkar, both severely ill, could have been axed.        
	But who will dare unseat ailing ministers who are also state secretariat members? asked a North 24-Parganas district committee member.         
	He cited the example of Subhas Chakraborty who heads three departments  transport, sports and youth affairs  despite being in poor health.        
	Chakrabortys fellow secretariat and central committee member Gautam Deb, who manages housing and public health engineering (which handles drinking water supply), too is ill and often skips office.        
	Sources said Surjya Kanta Mishra, the powerful secretariat member who heads three politically crucial departments  panchayats, rural development and health  has refused to part with any of them despite criticism of his performance.        
	Party leaders accused chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and industries minister Nirupam Sen of setting a poor example. They said a few state committee members had suggested a deputy chief minister to share Bhattacharjees burden but were ignored.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Buta drops PM name, set for CBI
                                                                                                               Buta drops PM name, set for CBI
                            
	New Delhi/Mumbai, Aug. 2 (PTI): Buta Singh today pledged to co-operate with the CBI if it wanted to question him in the bribery case against son Sarobjit, provided the agency followed proper procedures.        
	The former Union home minister, however, alleged the CBI was victimising him by framing and arresting Sarobjit and ruled out resigning as chairman of the National Commission for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.        
	He claimed having briefed the Prime Minister. I have briefed Prime Minister Manmohan Singh regarding the facts. He has responded positively and sought more details, Buta said.        
	He did not explain how the matter had been communicated to the Prime Minister, but said: I am also seeking an appointment to meet him and explain my position.        
	Asked if he might meet Sonia Gandhi, the former Bihar governor who has been expelled from the Congress, replied: I am competent to defend myself. Why should I trouble others?        
	Asked if he was ready to face CBI questioning, he said: I am ready to answer to all charges. I will fully co-operate if proper procedures are followed.        
	The CBI needs cabinet permission to interrogate Buta, since the commissions chairmanship is a constitutional post.        
	CBI director Ashwani Kumar yesterday said: If necessary, we will (question Buta). If there is a requirement, we will go as per procedure. No decision has been taken on it yet. We will go by the law.        
	The agency arrested Sarobjit in Mumbai for allegedly demanding a bribe of Rs 1 crore from a Nashik-based contractor, Ramrao Patil, to help quash a case against him before Butas commission. Alleged middleman Anup Beghe and two hawala operators, suspected to be working for Sarobjit, too were arrested.

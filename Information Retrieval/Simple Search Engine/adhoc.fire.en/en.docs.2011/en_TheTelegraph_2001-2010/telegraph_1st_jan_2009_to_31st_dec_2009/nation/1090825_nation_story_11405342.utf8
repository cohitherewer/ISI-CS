          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 24: Kapil Sibal has picked a bureaucrat-turned-academic as the Jamia Millia Islamia vice-chancellor, ending a battle that resonated in the corridors of power.         
	The education minister, trapped between political compulsions and his own intent, has nominated former bureaucrat Najeeb Jung, who gave up the IAS for academics in 1995. He will replace historian Mushirul Hasan as the Jamia VC. Hasan, an academic, and Bihar home secretary Afzal Amaanullah, a bureaucrat, were the two others shortlisted by an HRD ministry panel.         
	Hasan lost out because of apprehensions within the Congress, as his reappointment has been opposed by vast sections of influential Muslims, sources said. Amanullah was rejected because of Sibals intent that educationaists, and not bureaucrats should be appointed. Jung remained the only eligible candidate, with a background that can be termed academic, the sources said.

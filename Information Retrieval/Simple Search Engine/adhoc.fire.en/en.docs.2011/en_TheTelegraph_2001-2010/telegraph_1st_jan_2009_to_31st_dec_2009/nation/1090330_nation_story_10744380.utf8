The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Star war over Patna Saheb seat 
                                                                                                               Star war over Patna Saheb seat 
          NALIN VERMA                          Shekhar Suman: Will he shake things up?                                  
	Patna, March 29: The Patna Saheb Lok Sabha seat is likely to witness a starry battle with the Congress out to pit Shekhar Suman of Movers and Shakers fame against BJP hero Shatrughan Shotgun Sinha.        
	Sources in the Congress revealed that Sonia Gandhis political secretary Ahmad Patel has been in touch with Shekhar  an actor  in a bid to field a strong candidate against Shotgun for the seat.        
	The party high command has reportedly summoned BPCC president Anil Sharma to New Delhi before fielding the man who started his career with the television serial Wah Janab and made his debut on the big screen with Shashi Kapoors Utsav.        
	I will speak after the high command allows me to speak on the issue. Wait for a while longer, said BPCC chief while talking to The Telegraph over the phone from New Delhi.         
	Shekhars mother, Usha Prasad, however, confirmed rumours. My son will contest from the Patna Saheb seat. He has informed us of his plan. Like Shotgun, Sehkar, a son of doctor father Fanibhushan Prasad, too, belongs to Patna. Incidentally, Shekhar Suman and his senior peer from Bollywood both belong to the Kayastha community. In the caste conscious Bihar politics, the saffron party chose Shotgun as a nominee after carefully considering his community.         
	The BJP had not ventured to field Shotgun  its star campaigner  from any of the Bihar seats till the delimitation commission carved out the Patna Saheb seat where Kayasthas are numerically preponderant.         
	The Congresss game plan to rope in another Kayastha, promises to offer an interesting match in Patna Saheb  slated for polls in the last phase on May 7.         
	Bihar has been making headlines for having gangsters turned politicians in the fray ever since the Seventies. For a change, the state this time will go in annals of poll history for fielding the wives of gangsters turned MPs who stand disqualified due to the courts convicting them in criminal cases.         
	Wives of dons Md Shahabuddin, Surajbhan and Pappu Yadav  all convicts  are in the poll fray from different Bihar constituencies.         
	The state notorious for its culture of gun and strong arms politics had seldom been the destination of the Bollywood stars in the past. This poll season, however, all that is slated to change.        
	Filmmaker Prakash Jha is in the fray on the West Champaran seat as a LJP nominee. West Champran has been the bastion of the gangsters such as Bhagar Yadav and Sattan Yadav whos Jungle Party was responsible for kidnapping hundreds of people in the region.        
	Shotgun, too, is already in the fray. And if the Congress succeeds in fielding Shekhar Suman the latter will be the third candidate from Bollywood in Bihars poll fray.         
	In 2004, Shekhar was one of the judges of The Great Indian Laughter Challenge along with Navjot Singh Sidhu, a former cricketer. The show was a stand-up comedy contest and a first-of-its-kind on Indian television.

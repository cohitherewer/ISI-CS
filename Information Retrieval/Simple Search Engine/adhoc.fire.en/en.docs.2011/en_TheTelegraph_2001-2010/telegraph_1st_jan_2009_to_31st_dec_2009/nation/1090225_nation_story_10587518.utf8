The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Eye on polls for Lonely separatist
                                                                                                               Eye on polls for Lonely separatist
  - Hurriyat leader mulls   end to political exile         SANKARSHAN THAKUR                           Sajjad Lone                                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 24: Peoples Conference leader Sajjad Lone may become the first Kashmiri separatist to break ranks with the Hurriyat and join electoral politics when India goes to the polls this summer.        
	Hurriyat circles have indicated to The Telegraph that Lone is actively considering strong advice from friends, party members and constituents that he should end his meaningless political exile and contest the Baramulla Lok Sabha seat.        
	Lone himself was not available for comment but a close friend and adviser said: Pressure has been growing on Sajjad to take the plunge particularly because we all know he does not see eye to eye with most Hurriyat leaders and their politics really is headed nowhere. Sajjad is still young and those keen on him contesting believe that Kashmir needs an articulate spokesman like him in Parliament.        
	He pointedly underlined, though, that contesting elections would not mean Sajjad was giving up on Kashmiri self-determination. He has a well-formulated view on Kashmiri sovereignty which he has documented in detail and circulated. If he decides to contest, it will be a step in pursuance of the aims of Kashmiri aspiration, the source said.        
	The Peoples Conference leader has just returned to Kashmir after nearly two months in Pakistan, where he was visiting family. Lone is married to the daughter of Amanullah Khan of the Pakistani chapter of the JKLF; the couple have twin sons, who have been living with their mother in Rawalpindi for lack of entry visas to India.        
	Lones differences with the entire spectrum of Hurriyat leaders, from hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani to the moderate Mirwaiz Umer Farooq, are well known.         
	At a personal level, Lones sympathisers believe that his father, Abdul Ghani Lone, the founder of the party, was shot dead by militants close to pro-Pakistani elements in the Hurriyat. Politically, the young Lone has seldom submitted to the collective wisdom of the Hurriyat, choosing to plough his own furrow, even though he remains a separatist. He was not, for instance, part of the Hurriyat Coordination Committee that spearheaded last summers Amarnath upsurge in the Valley.         
	Following the huge vote in the November-December elections in Jammu and Kashmir, Lone emerged stridently critical of the Hurriyats failed boycott call and demanded fundamental revisions in strategy. Lone strongly believes that the vote did not in any sense mean an endorsement of New Delhis line on Kashmir, but he is equally firm that the Hurriyat is out of sync with popular sentiment in the Valley.         
	People want leadership, they want to be led by good Kashmiri leaders and we have to see how we can provide that leadership, Lone had told The Telegraph soon after the election process was over and the house-arrest order on him lifted.         
	Sources close to him now say Lone has since been thinking of ways to alter strategy and indulge in more meaningful politics in Kashmir. They agree, though, that it will be a tough crossover to manoeuvre.         
	I know for a fact that he has been repeatedly told by well-wishers that opting out of politics, especially electoral politics, has become counterproductive, a friend said. It is like being in public life and being out of it at the same time. Sajjad has become more receptive to this logic, but it is probably difficult and tricky for him to overnight reject the politics of electoral boycott and yet retain his credibility. It is very easy for him to get labelled an Indian agent by Hurriyat hardliners, no matter how honest and independent his intentions. That is what he must work on.         
	Lone is known to have expressed confidence, privately, that he can carry the Baramulla Lok Sabha seat which includes his north Kashmir home base of Kupwara.        
	Political analysts say that the PDP may not be averse to an understanding with Lone  overt or covert.

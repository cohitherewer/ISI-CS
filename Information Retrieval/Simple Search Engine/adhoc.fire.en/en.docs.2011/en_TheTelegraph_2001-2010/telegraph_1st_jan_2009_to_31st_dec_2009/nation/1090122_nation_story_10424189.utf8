The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | UP land protest kills farmer
                                                                                                               UP land protest kills farmer
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      The police outpost that was set on fire by the land protesters near Mathura. (PTI)                          
	Lucknow, Jan. 21: A Mathura farmer protesting against poor land compensation died in police firing last evening in a replay of the August crackdown that had killed four Noida landlosers.        
	Ganesh Singh, part of a crowd of over 1,000 farmers from Bajna, in Mathura, whose land is being acquired for an expressway, succumbed to his injuries this morning. Unofficial sources put the toll at three.        
	Police sources said they opened fire in self-defence after being pelted with stones by the rampaging protesters, who allegedly broke into the office of the contractor building the highway, torched a police outpost, damaged buses and blocked traffic.         
	The police claimed at least 12 officials were injured.        
	Some of the 18 injured protesters have been admitted to Mathura District Hospital while the others have been shifted to Delhi.        
	The Yamuna Expressway will connect Noida with Agra. Sources said the Mathura farmers, now being given Rs 350 per square metre, were demanding Rs 750 a square metre, the rate paid for land to farmers last year in Noida for an infrastructure project.        
	Uttar Pradesh officials, however, said the two could not be linked as Noida was an industrial hub and commanded higher land prices while Bajna was a rural area.        
	The protesters whose land is being acquired for the 165km expressway have demanded that they be paid on a par with their counterparts in Noida, state additional police chief Brij Lal said in Lucknow, adding that the situation was under control.        
	The farmers have been protesting for the past 16 days but their agitation turned violent yesterday after they barged into the camp office of the Jaypee Group, which has been given the contract to build the highway.        
	Social activist Ravi Singh, who saw yesterdays police firing, said the expressway project had caused panic among farmers. The Yamuna Expressway may drive up real estate prices, Singh said, implying the farmers should get a price that reflected the likely rise in land rates.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Feb. 22: Orissa State Bar Council has opposed the amendments made in the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) granting discretionary powers to police to not arrest persons involved in an offence bearing a maximum sentence of seven years.         
	Council president Gopal Krushna Mohanty told The Telegraph that his council, with other associations in the country, would oppose the amendments.         
	According to Mohanty, the council has passed a resolution opposing the amendments to Sections 40 and 340 of the CrPC while supporting the statewide and countrywide lawyers boycott against the amendment.         
	The council secretary, Jajati K. Samantsinghar, said that the government could not bring such amendments without taking the legal fraternity and bar associations into confidence.         
	The council described the amendments as a black law, adding that the amendments would give a free hand to frauds, unscrupulous elements, extortionists and dowry pushers who would have nothing to fear for.         
	Consequently, both lives and properties of law-abiding citizens would be jeopardised and people would be left at the mercy of anti-social elements with criminal track records  believe the lawyers.         
	They added that the police could also misuse this new law and the discretionary powers it grants the force, to shield culprits.         
	According to the amendments, police would be required to seek prior court permission before arresting a person and would be able to arrest people only involved in crimes such as murder, rape and robbery.         
	OSBC demanded the repeal of the amendments that betrayed the feudal mindset of the government.

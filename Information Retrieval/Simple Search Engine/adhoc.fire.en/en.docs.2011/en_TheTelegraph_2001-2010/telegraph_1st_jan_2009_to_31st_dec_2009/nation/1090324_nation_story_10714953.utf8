The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Priyanka jab: read the Gita
                                                                                                               Priyanka jab: read the Gita
          OUR BUREAU                          Priyanka Vadra waves to supporters in Rae Bareli on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	March 23: Priyanka Vadra today asked Varun Gandhi to properly read the Gita he swears by, possibly making one of the sharpest comments ever by one Gandhi against another.        
	Referring to Varuns alleged hate speech against Muslims, Priyanka said: What Varun had said clearly goes against all principles the Gandhi family stood for lived and died for. It is really sad to see him saying all these things on television.        
	Sonia Gandhis daughter, who had just offered prayers at a Hanuman temple in her mothers constituency of Rae Bareli, added: I would advise him to read the Gita properly and try to understand it.        
	Varun, BJP nominee from Pilibhit, had allegedly told a rally that if anyone lifted a hand against Hindus, I swear on the Gita that I will cut off that hand.        
	To Congress sources in Delhi, always curious about how close the children of Sonia and Maneka Gandhi are, Priyankas comment has apparently clarified matters to an extent.        
	Still, asked about the Varun camps claims about the two cousins rapport, Congress sources cautiously said they thought the remarks were far-fetched but declined to speak on record.        
	The word from Varun and those close to him is that Priyankadidi keeps in touch with him and that the cousins always greet each other on their birthdays. Varun was last seen at 10 Janpath at Priyankas wedding.        
	These sources have also spread the buzz that Priyanka didnt want the Congress to field a candidate against Varun. The Congress has asked Manekas cousin, B.M. Singh, to contest from Pilibhit.        
	Priyanka, however, had until today been guarded in her comments about Varun. He is my brother and I wish him well, was all she said a couple of years ago.        
	Congress sources refused to comment also on the claims that Sonia and her children had asked Varun to reconsider his decision to join the BJP. Varun had told some reporters in 2005 that when Sonia heard of his decision, she told him: But darling, whatever came over you?        
	To the Gandhis, Varuns visit to the RSS headquarters to meet then sarsanghachalak K.S. Sudarshan apparently amounted to a family member spurning the Nehruvian legacy of secularism and inclusiveness.        
	Varun always insisted he did not take the RSS salute at a shakha he attended at Nagpur, but this did not cut much ice with the Gandhis, sources said. The Pilibhit speech apparently aggravated matters.        
	Priyanka Gandhi made a pertinent point when she said Varun should take lessons from the Gita to understand the Hindu religion rather than make comments against other religions, Congress leader Digvijay Singh said. We would never imagine a person belonging to the Gandhi family could say such things.

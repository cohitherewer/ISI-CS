The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Precise threat to Google
                                                                                                               Precise threat to Google
          G.S. MUDUR                               
	New Delhi, May 19: A just-launched automated knowledge engine that throws up precise answers to queries on myriad subjects may pose a challenge to web-based search engines such as Google, computer scientists said today.         
	The new knowledge engine, the brainchild of UK-born theoretical physicist Stephen Wolfram, was launched over the weekend in the US and is now accessible worldwide through its website www.wolframalpha.com.         
	Users may seek diverse information through just a few keyboard clicks  from the exact nutritional content of two slices of toast and two scrambled eggs to the first release date and the cast and characters of Bollywood film Sholay, to financial information about leading companies. But early users caution that, for the moment, some queries may still generate no response.         
	When you know exactly what you want  and want it really fast, you might want to try this engine, said Arnab Bhattacharya, a computer scientist at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, who specialises in data mining and is one of its earliest users.         
	Web-based search engines such as Google provide links to related web pages, and users have to retrieve knowledge hidden in the returned web pages on their own. WolframAlpha, on the other hand, automatically provides detailed information in response to queries without users having to search through a large number of possible information sources.         
	It does this by extracting information or computing from its own internal knowledge base. Some data in the knowledge base is from public or private websites, but most comes from primary sources.         
	The engine uses a computational software called Mathematica, conceived by Wolfram, 49, who studied physics at Oxford and Caltech before turning his focus on technical computation and setting up a company, Wolfram Research.         
	The engine covers diverse topics  from science, technology and medicine to economy and finance, from culture and movies and songs to sports, history, geography and personalities. It is already quite versatile, but its database still needs to be packed with a lot more information, Bhattacharya said.        
	It solves mathematical problems... so it could become a tool for students or faculty, Bhattacharya said. It provides very detailed information that might take quite a while through conventional search engines. A four-word query, for instance, can produce the exact ratio of populations of Calcutta and Mumbai.         
	When queried with the word Sholay, the engine delivers key data about the 1975 film  its release date, cast and characters, including the fact that the character of Sambha was played by Mac Mohan.         
	The engine provides a list of the sources from where the information was generated, allowing users to assess their credentials. This is an important feature because you cant always be sure about authenticity of information on the Internet, said a computer science faculty member at IIT Bombay.

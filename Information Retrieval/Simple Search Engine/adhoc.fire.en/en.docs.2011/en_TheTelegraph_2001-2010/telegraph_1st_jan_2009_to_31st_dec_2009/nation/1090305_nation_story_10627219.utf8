The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Twin Chinese jolts to India, via media
                                                                                                               Twin Chinese jolts to India, via media
          JAYANTH JACOB                           Wen: Double blow                                  
	New Delhi, March 4: China has given Delhi a double headache even as a new administration settles in at the White House.         
	Two articles in Peoples Daily, the Chinese Communist Partys mouthpiece, have India worried about Beijings intentions.         
	In its issue dated February 23, the daily has equated the India-Pakistan problem  or the Kashmir issue  with problems of terrorism in Afghanistan and Pakistan.         
	The Afghan problem, the Pakistani problem and the Indian-Pakistani problem were all related, an article said, adding this was the reason US special envoy to Pakistan and Afghanistan Richard Holbrooke included India in his visit to the region.         
	Therefore, to safeguard its own interests in the fight against terrorism in South Asia, the US must ensure a stable domestic and international environment for Pakistan and ease the tension between India and Pakistan, the Peoples Daily said.        
	The article was published the day Hillary Clinton was on her first visit to Beijing as the US secretary of state.         
	This view is not what Chinese officials have been articulating in formal and informal meetings with India. However, the Chinese have a way of hinting at a change in policy through the official media and think tank, which are under state control.         
	Three days after the first article came another that appeared to argue against Indias inclusion as a permanent member of the UN Security Council. On February 26, the Peoples Daily said the Security Council reform was not just about increasing the permanent members.         
	Reforms should ensure that the large number of small- and medium-sized nations have more opportunities and can participate in decision-making in the UNSC in a more substantive manner... reform of the UNSC is not just about increasing the permanent members, it said.         
	Beijing has for years been promising India support for its bid for a permanent seat. In April 2005, the visiting Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao had offered his countrys support. This was repeated during Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs visit to Beijing in January 2008.         
	We have always been given to understand that China supports our aspirations for the UNSC. This kind of posture worries us about Beijings intentions, especially at a time when the UN reforms are set to gather momentum and the new US administration also is keen on that, a source in Delhi said.

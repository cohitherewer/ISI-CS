The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Stormy session awaits Assembly
                                                                                                               Stormy session awaits Assembly

	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 8: The ensuing pre-budget session of the Assembly, starting tomorrow, is likely to be stormy.        
	The session will have just six working days and conclude on Saturday. Normally these brief Assembly sessions are dull. But since this is the last before the general elections, it will be stormy, feel political observers.        
	The Opposition parties would try to launch a scathing attack on the ruling BJD-BJP government as this would be the last opportunity for them to expose the governments failures, said Surya Mishra, a political science professor of Utkal University.        
	Congress legislature party, which has recently undergone leadership change, would make all out efforts to put the government on the mat.        
	Ulaka Ramachandra, who has been elected as the new Leader of Opposition in place of veteran J.B. Patnaik, said Congress with the support of all other Opposition parties would mount a joint attack on the BJD-BJP government on all issues.        
	The major issues listed out by the Congress legislature party, which met here today to chalk out strategies, included deterioration in law and order, various scams and failure of the government in utilising funds under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, said firebrand party MLA Tara Prasad Bahinipati.        
	Though the faction-ridden Congress has undergone a massive leadership change, the party has, however, been demoralised following its drubbing in the elections to Cuttack Municipal Corporation and Baripada municipality. The party MLAs are yet to recover from the shock of defeat and also wary of general elections, said a senior party leader, adding that the ensuing session might be dull.        
	On the other hand, the ruling BJD-BJP alliance is prepared to counter the Opposition attack. We are ready to discuss any issue raised by the Opposition, said parliamentary affairs minister and senior BJD leader Raghunath Mohanty.        
	The ruling alliance would raise issues such as neglect and apathy of the UPA government towards Orissa, price rise of essential commodities and the move of the Congress-ruled Andhra Pradesh government to construct a dam at Polavaram, which would affect the bordering Orissa districts.        
	The government will present a vote-on-account for the first four months. Finance minister Prafulla Chandra Ghadei said he had taken care of major requirements of the state, while preparing the vote-on-account.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Link minister for education 
                                                                                                               Link minister for education 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, June 2: On her blog and personal website, Daggubati Purandeswari is the minister of state for higher education in the human resource development ministry.        
	But the daughter of Telugu cinema legend and former chief minister N.T. Rama Rao enjoys a significantly larger profile in her second stint at the ministry, under Kapil Sibal, than the virtual worlds posts suggest.        
	Handpicked for the job by Sonia Gandhi, Purandeswari has the task of bridging two generations of thought at the helm of the countrys education hierarchy in assisting the Prime Minister take forward his vision for the sector.        
	Sonia, it is learnt, personally informed Purandeswari that her portfolio has been chosen specifically to ensure continuity at the critical ministry. She has the task of catalysing the merger of the old and the new HRD regimes, a ministry veteran said.        
	Unlike in the UPAs first tenure when the ministry had two junior ministers, Purandeswari is the lone minister of state this time  responsible for both higher and school education.        
	For the past three years, the 50-year-old Purandeswari and Mohammed Ashraf Ali Faatmi were deputies to Arjun Singh, a man who bureaucrats say took all policy decisions on his own.        
	Sources close to Sibal indicated that the new HRD minister may try and utilise Purandeswaris experience under Arjun in taking major policy decisions.        
	The minister (Sibal) told me that he wants to work in close concert, will allow me to work on my own and consult me on major decisions, Purandeswari told The Telegraph after meeting Sibal in his office yesterday.         
	In the old regime, Faatmi rarely visited office, and Purandeswari had significant workload only during Parliament sessions, when she answered questions for the ministry, and during spells when Arjuns health prevented him from working.

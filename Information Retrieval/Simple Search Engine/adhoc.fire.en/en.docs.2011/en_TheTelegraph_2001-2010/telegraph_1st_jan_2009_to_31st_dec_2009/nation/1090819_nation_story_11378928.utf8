	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 18: Posco today ruled out any possibility of moving out of Orissa in spite of the Union mines minister hinting at an alternative location for its proposed 12-million-tonne steel plant.        
	The minister, B.K. Handique, told reporters on the sidelines of a conference in New Delhi that Posco might opt for another location as it had been facing problems of land acquisition in Orissa. Posco is facing problems of land acquisition. They have decided to move to a different place, he said.         
	But later, the ministers office clarified that Posco would not move out of Orissa but may shift to a nearby location.        
	Posco India general manager Saroj Mohapatra said: We are committed to the project. We never had any plan to shift our Orissa project, nor do we have now.        
	But Posco India officials admitted that some villagers at the proposed plant site were still opposed to it and efforts were on to win them over.        
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik said the state government had not recieved any communication from Posco regarding its relocation. We have not received any proposal from Posco for relocation of its steel plant project, Patnaik said in New Delhi.         
	State steel and mines minister Raghunath Mohanty said he was confident the Posco project would come up at the proposed location as per the MoU.         
	The South Korean steel major had signed an MoU with the Orissa government in June 2005 for establishment of a 12 MTPA steel plant near Paradip port. B        
	illed as one of the largest FDI projects at $12 billion, the mega steel plant, however, has failed to take off because of local resistance over land acquisition.        
	Out of the total requirement of 4,004 acre, around 500 acre was private land. So far, the state government had failed to acquire any private land because of stiff resistance by local villagers.         
	We are negotiating with the local people, government officials and others, Mohapatra said. Employment will not be a problem. Not a single person from the three gram panchayat areas will remain unemployed after physical construction starts, he said.

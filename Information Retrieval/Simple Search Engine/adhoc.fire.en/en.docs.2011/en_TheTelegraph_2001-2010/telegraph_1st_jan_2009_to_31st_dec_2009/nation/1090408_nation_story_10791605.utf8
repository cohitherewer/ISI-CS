The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Power is cash for comrades
                                                                                                               Power is cash for comrades
          JAYANTH JACOB                                            
	New Delhi, April 7: Being in power can make a difference to a partys fortunes, and even the CPM seems no exception.        
	Party leaders in favour of joining the next government at the Centre  if the Lok Sabha numbers throw up the possibility  may see this as a key argument: the CPMs Bengal unit is its richest after an uninterrupted 32-year reign.        
	Also, the partys Bengal members appear better off than those in Kerala, where the Left has had to take turns with the Congress-led UDF in forming the government.        
	These indications about the advantages of power are thrown up by the details of the partys income-tax returns for 2004-2005, accessed by The Telegraph.        
	In Bengal, where the CPM has been in power since 1977, the party unit received Rs 2.96 crore in ordinary annual donations and a further Rs 8.74 crore in poll-related donations, 2004 having been an election year.        
	It collected Rs 8.34 crore in levies  the percentage of their income each member must pay the party  and earned Rs 68.2 lakh in interest on its savings. The state units total income for the year was Rs 20.78 crore.        
	Compare this with the Kerala unit, whose annual income was just Rs 4.50 crore with donations amounting to Rs 1.77 crore (the unit doesnt show a break-up of poll-related and ordinary donations).        
	And the levy collected in Kerala was Rs 1.98 crore  less than a fourth of the Bengal figure, although the southern state has 3.36 lakh party members compared with Bengals 3.21 lakh.        
	Bengals Marxists, therefore, appear to earn four times more per head than their Kerala comrades. Two factors could explain this  Bengal CPM members have possibly grown richer at a faster clip in these 32 years, and the long reign may have attracted a higher number of well-off people to the party.        
	Even in Tripura, much smaller than Kerala but where the CPM has ruled almost continuously since 1978 barring one five-year term (1988-93), the party unit earned more than in the southern state  Rs 5.23 crore.        
	The Tripura unit, in a surprise, received Rs 3.26 crore in ordinary donations  a little more than Bengal  although its poll-related donations were far lower at Rs 1.8 crore.

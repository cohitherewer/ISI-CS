          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Kareena Kapoor                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 17: A maid from Bengal tried to cash in on Bebos absence but is now cooling her heels in police lock-up.        
	Thirty-five-year-old Anita Das, one of 10 domestic helps at Kareena Kapoors residence in suburban Khar, has been arrested along with two others on charges of stealing Rs 2.55 lakh in cash and jewellery while the Bollywood star was abroad shooting.        
	The three, arrested on October 15, have been remanded in police custody till Monday. Police sources said all three had confessed to stealing the cash and the jewellery.        
	According to the sources, the theft was discovered on October 8 after Kareenas mother Babita found Rs 2.14 lakh in cash, a pearl necklace and a ring missing from her room.        
	Kareenas secretary Zahid Akram Khan had kept the money in Babitas room while she was away and had informed her about it. When Babita returned, she found the money wasnt there.        
	Investigating officer N. Sonawane said the Kapoor family searched the entire house and also asked their 10 servants. The search revealed that jewellery worth Rs 41,000 was also missing from the room.        
	Sonawane said the family waited for Kareena to return before filing a complaint. Suspecting the role of an insider, the police began questioning the servants and found discrepancies in the versions given by Anita and the two others  Pawansingh Chauhan, 24, from Rajasthan and Tina Yadav, 26, from Uttar Pradesh.        
	Anita changed her statements frequently and her body language made us suspect her. We also found the other two servants behaving strangely. We found discrepancies in their statements about where they were that evening. After sustained grilling, Anita broke down and confessed to the crime followed by the others, Sonawane told The Telegraph.        
	All three had access to any part of the house, including Babitas room, the officer added.        
	Sonawane said Anita and Pawansingh had gone to see Babitas new mobile phone when they saw the money Kareenas secretary had kept. Tina later joined them, and they distributed the cash among themselves before stealing the jewellery, too, he said.        
	Sonawane said Anita had confessed to having deposited Rs 45,000 in the account of one Badal Jalan from her village in Bengal. We have recovered the jewellery and Rs 1.54 lakh in cash from the trio, the officer added.

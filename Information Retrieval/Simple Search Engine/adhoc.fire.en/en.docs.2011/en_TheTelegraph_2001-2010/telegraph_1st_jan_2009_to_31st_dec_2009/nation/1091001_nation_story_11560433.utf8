  - Obama to host singh on Nov. 24                              A state dinner setting at the East Room of the White House. (File picture)                                  
	And the first state dinner of President Barack Obamas administration goes to... India.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is coming to the US for a state visit on November 24. Such visits include an elaborate arrival ceremony on the White House South Lawn, one-on-one time with the President and, in the evening, a state dinner.        
	It is a plum presidential nod of recognition for the worlds largest democracy and most stable US ally in a hostile corner of the world.        
	But why India first?        
	It was just four years ago that former President George W. Bush and Singh raised their glasses and toasted the US-India relationship at the start of a July 2005 state dinner.        
	Indian officials, however, have watched warily since then as the US has become more engaged with its arch-rival, Pakistan, focusing on greater military cooperation in dealing with Islamist extremists.                           Obama raising a toast, Singh      
	Honouring Singh with one of the grandest and most glamorous of White House affairs 10 months into Obamas presidency may allay some of those concerns, along with perceptions that Pakistan has surpassed India as Americas best friend in South Asia.        
	US secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton hand-delivered the state-visit invitation from Obama during her July trip to India.        
	But a visit to India so far has escaped the sights of the Presidents travel planners. That is where the state dinner comes in.        
	Obamas first one will be the talk of the town, perhaps second only to his inauguration and the parties that followed in terms of celebrity star power and got-to-be-there fever.        
	A tonne of planning is involved, from creating the invitation itself to compiling a guest list. Meals, desserts and wines are tasted until the right pairings are found. Flowers must be chosen and arranged just so, along with the seating, place settings and entertainment.        
	Responsibility for the planning falls on First Lady Michelle Obama and her staff, and people will be waiting to see what twists she will put on one of the White Houses most staid traditions.        
	Early state dinner rumblings after Obama took office were about opening the events up to real people.        
	Inquiring minds also want to know what other changes may be in store. Will they eat in the State Dining Room or shift chairs to the larger East Room? Will dinner courses be prepared with vegetables pulled from Michelles popular South Lawn garden? Would they consider putting their well-dressed guests on boats headed down the Potomac River to Mount Vernon? John F. Kennedy did that for his first state dinner just a few months into his term, in May 1961, for the President of Tunisia. Or how about dinner and black-tie inside a big tent in the Rose Garden? Bill Clinton did that for his first such dinner, in June 1994, for the Japanese emperor. Bush held his first state dinner  for Mexico  less than a week before 9/11.

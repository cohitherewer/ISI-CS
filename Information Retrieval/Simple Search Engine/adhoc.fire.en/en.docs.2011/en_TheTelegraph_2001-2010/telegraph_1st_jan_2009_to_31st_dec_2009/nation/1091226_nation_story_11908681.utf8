          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Dec. 25: The Naveen Patnaik government has been embroiled in a controversy with Orissa High Court admitting a writ petition alleging revival of animal sacrifice ritual at the Sulia Thakurani pitha at Khariguda in Bolangir at the behest of a cabinet minister, who was not named in the petition though.        
	Sulia Sanskar Manch joint convener Debashis Biswal had filed the petition alleging that the Sulia jatra ritual of animal sacrifice on the first Tuesday of Pausha month was revived at the Thakurani pithas Badakhala after four years on December 22.        
	Hundreds of animals were sacrificed as part of the Sulia jatra ritual in the presence of a sub-collector and a deputy superintendent of police. According to practice, the ritual is also observed on the three following Tuesdays. The Manch had sought judicial intervention against continuation of the animal sacrifice ritual.        
	The division bench of acting Chief Justice I.M. Quddusi and Justice R.N. Biswal issued directions to the state government to ensure that no animals are sacrificed in the next three Tuesdays.

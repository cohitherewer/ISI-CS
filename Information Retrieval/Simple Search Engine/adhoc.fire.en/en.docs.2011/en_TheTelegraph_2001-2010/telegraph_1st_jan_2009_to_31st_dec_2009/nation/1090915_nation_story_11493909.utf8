The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Activists demand caretaker release
                                                                                                               Activists demand caretaker release
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 14: Activists, nearly all of them women, staged a dharna before the Mahila police station today demanding the release of a complainant in a case involving a sex racket at an orphanage.        
	Deepika Barik, the caretaker of the shelter home-cum-orphanage, has been detained at the police station for three days, since she lodged an FIR on Saturday.         
	There is no reason for a victim to be detained, said Rutuporna Mohanty, an activist. She added that Deepika should be free as she has undergone a medical test and police have interrogated her.         
	She was hospitalised recently after facing repeated sexual assaults. She has already done her bit in the case by giving her statement and by lodging the FIR. At least now, there should be some respite for her, she said.        
	The women squatted in front of the thana till late in the evening. We will continue till she is released. What is the need to detain a victim even after interrogations are over. She should now be in a shelter home where the inmates have been moved, said an activist.        
	The victim should not be treated as an accused. Women now will think twice before lodging a protest, said Rutuporna. Personnel at the Mahila police station have refused to comment on the matter or release the victim.         
	Accused Byomakesh Tripathy has been forwarded to jail with charges of rape (Section 376), outraging modesty (354), wrongful confinement (342) and for attempt to murder (307) and threatening to kill (506) under the IPC.         
	The seized computers and DVDs are being scanned. A police source said that Tripathy seemed to have an idea that his home could be raided and had formatted the CDs, making them harder to read. We will scan the computer and the DVD player soon, sad commissioner B.K. Sharma.

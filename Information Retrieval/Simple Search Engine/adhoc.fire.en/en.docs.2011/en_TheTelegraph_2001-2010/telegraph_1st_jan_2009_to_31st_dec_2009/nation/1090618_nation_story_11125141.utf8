          PRIYA ABRAHAM                               
	Bhubaneswar, June 17: The Similipal National Park has now earned a part in the prestigious Unesco world network of biosphere reserves.        
	This was announced under Unescos Man and Biosphere (MAB) programme that was launched in 1970 with an aim to improve the connection between people and their environment.        
	The international designation is believed to enhance the effectiveness of Similipal as an individual biosphere, besides strengthen communication and co-operation at regional and international levels. Similipal qualified all criteria and fit the Unesco designation. We had been trying for few years to get Simlipal its worth for years now, said a visibly happy chief conservator of forest, S.S. Srivastava.         
	According to required criteria, Similipal encompasses a mosaic of ecological systems, including a gradation of human interventions and is significant for bio-diversity conservation.         
	Spread over 3,045sqkm, the biosphere has an appropriate size to serve conservation of landscapes, ecosystems, species and genetic variation, to foster economic and human development, which is socio-culturally and ecologically sustainable.         
	Besides, the site has a legally constituted core area of 850sqkm devoted to long-term protection. It also has a buffer zone clearly identified.        
	The procedure requires a particular state to forward their nomination with supporting documents to the Unesco. Then MABs international co-ordinating council takes a decision on nominations for designation and accordingly notifies the state concerned, said senior researcher of state forest department, L. Singh         
	Now that it is a biosphere reserve, Similipal will be now subjected to a periodical review for every 10 years, to be forwarded to Unesco by the government.         
	Two more sites from India  Panchmari and Nokrek  was also included in the 2009 network taking the total number of biosphere reserves to seven.         
	Nilgiri was the first biosphere reserve in the country to bag the title in 2000. It was followed by the Gulf of Mannar and the Sunderbans in 2001 and Nanda Devi in 2004.

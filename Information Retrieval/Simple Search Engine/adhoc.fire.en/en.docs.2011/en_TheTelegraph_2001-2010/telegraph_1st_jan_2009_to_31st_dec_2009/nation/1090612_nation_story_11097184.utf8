                                                                                                               Nitish opposes base shift
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, June 11: Chief minister Nitish Kumar today opposed the defence establishments move to shift the army service corps (ASC) centre from Gaya to Bengaluru (Karnataka), in a strongly worded letter to defence minister A.K. Antony.         
	While Karnataka has several army units, our state (Bihar) prone to natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes, has only two army establishments, which is a sub-area headquarters at Danapur and an ASC centre at Gaya.         
	The letter said that the Gaya army base had been serving as a source of support for thousands of international pilgrims who visit Bodh Gaya every year. The chief minister said the shift would also deprive youths in the Naxalite-dominated districts of employment. The base employs them as cadre.         
	Moreover, the Gaya ASC centre provided response force to Bihar at times of disasters such as floods, which affected almost 22 districts in 2008. Nitish described the shift as an injustice and requested the defence minister to intervene and halt the move.         
	The letter reminded Antony of the former defence minister Jagjivan Rams role in getting the ASC centre in Gaya.         
	In a letter to Union home minister P. Chidambaram, Nitish drew the latters attention to improper treatment meted out to Bihar students by Pune colleges.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Aug. 16: Indira Gandhi praised it, the US Republicans embraced it and the Greeks and Romans revered its strength. So what if Mayavati spends a few lakhs to commemorate it?        
	The Bahujan Samaj Party has told the Election Commission its government has built elephant statues at a Lucknow park not because the animal is the party symbol but because it has been a shaper of history and an icon of Indian culture.        
	Anyway, the statues have their trunk raised in a welcome posture like those in the Akshardham temple of Delhi. Therefore, no parallel could be drawn with the party symbol, says the 63-page reply signed by BSP general secretary S.C. Mishra and submitted on Wednesday.        
	The commission had on August 5 issued a notice to the BSP on a petition by a lawyer who said public money was being squandered to install statues of the party symbol.        
	In that case, the BSP said, the Congress symbol, the hand, will come under serious cloud as every political leader while waving to people perforce shows the hand thereby inadvertently giving publicity to the Congress party symbol, the BSP has said.        
	All Hindu gods are depicted in postures blessing their devotees by showing their hand, so they should be removed from temples too.        
	The BSP reply is an extended essay on the elephant. The animal decided the fate of many battles in the Greco-Roman age. The use of elephants in the military forced the production of counter weapons and thus stimulated technological developments.        
	It quotes former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi as writing in 1982: The elephant is one of the most loved animals. It is a byword for strength and for wisdom.        
	The BSP claims the Republican Party of the US once used the elephant as its symbol and yet there were elephant sculptures throughout the US.

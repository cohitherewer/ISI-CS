                                                                                                               Girl caller harasses firemen
                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 2 (PTI): A Delhi girl making crank calls may be playing with fire.        
	The capitals fire officials have lodged a police complaint saying they are being harassed by calls from an unidentified girl who wants to talk dirty and play pranks.        
	The calls, mainly made around midnight to the officials in the fire departments control room, started in November last year.        
	According to a senior official, the girl wants to talk dirty and play pranks with the duty officer.        
	The caller often gives wrong information about incidents of blaze that eventually turn out to be a hoax, the official said. Acting on the calls, our men reached several destinations but realised it was nothing but a hoax. We are really irritated and have registered a complaint, he added.        
	At other times, the girl plays songs and dialogues from Bollywood movies in the background to disturb the personnel on duty, the official said.        
	The girl also connects calls with the police control room and hospitals. The official believes it is the job of some miscreants who want to harass the firemen handling the crucial night shift.

          SHEENA K.                               
	Raipur, Feb. 20: The government always cries for resources to fight Maoists. But its officials are least bothered to collect arms and ammunition from ordnance factories.        
	It was observed that the collection of arms and ammunition worth Rs 12.26 crore was substantially delayed ranging from 63 to 308 days since 2004, a report of the Comptroller and Auditor-General of India (CAG) said.         
	The report for the year ended March 31, 2008, was presented in the Assembly today.        
	The delays in collection of arms and ammunition were affecting the fighting capability of the force, the report underlined.         
	The weapons were to be collected by the police department on intimation by the factories of Ordnance Factory Board by making its own arrangement. Of the weapons include sophisticated arms and ammunition worth Rs 12.26 crore.         
	Being the worst Maoist-hit state, Chhattisgarh has been asking the Centre for more resources to combat the red army in the state. But it took more than 10 months (in one instance) for the Chhattisgarh police to collect arms and ammunition from an ordnance factory in Maharashtra.         
	The department, according to the CAG report, clarified that collection of arms and ammunition involved arrangement of vehicle, police guards and that the collection is being done by Central Reserve Store, Raipur, which does not have adequate sanctioned strength. Therefore, there were delays because of correspondence within the police department.         
	The CAG report said that the department had assured that it would collect arms at the earliest in future. The report also said that the scrutiny of records in Raipur revealed that expired ammunition was issued to the police to discharge their duties. The ammunition in the store was beyond expiry period and the same was being issued on demand, it added.         
	The Raipur police, in its reply, said that action for disposal of expired ammunition would be taken after receiving directions from the state police headquarters.

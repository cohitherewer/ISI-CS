          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Seth                                  
	New Delhi, July 2: And then, Vikram Seth created the suitable sequel.        
	The author today announced that his novel, A Suitable Boy, would have a follow-up, A Suitable Girl, to be published by Penguin in the autumn of 2013.        
	While the earlier novel was set in a newly independent India, the sequel will bring the narrative up to the present day. A Suitable Boy was about the search for a groom for Lata, the books rebellious central character, by her mother. In the sequel, Lata is a grandmother, and its her grandson who is looking for a bride.        
	The 1,350-page A Suitable Boy sold over a quarter million copies in hardback and over one million in paperback. Between now and 2013, Penguin will publish a new volume of Seths poems and a book of essays by him.        
	In India, all my books have for years been published by Penguin. But I am very happy today to be joining foreign colonies of the Flightless One. They have already made me feel very welcome, and I hope in time to hatch many suitable eggs with them, Seth said.

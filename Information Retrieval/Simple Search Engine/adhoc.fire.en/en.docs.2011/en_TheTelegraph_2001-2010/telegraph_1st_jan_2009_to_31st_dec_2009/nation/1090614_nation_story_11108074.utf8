The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Annual scan of rules for arms purchase
                                                                                                               Annual scan of rules for arms purchase
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 13: The defence ministry will review its purchase policy of military hardware every year instead of once every two years to make it more market-friendly, defence minister A.K. Antony has instructed.        
	The Defence Procurement Policy (DPP), a practice that was begun in 2003, as India began diversifying its sources of military equipment, sets down the procedures through which purchases are made. It is aimed at making the acquisition process transparent after a series of scams cast a shadow on defence purchases.         
	But the government continues to make purchases through non-tender deals for urgent or fast-track needs projected by the armed forces.        
	Defence ministry sources explained that the reason for reviewing the DPP annually was to update the policy and align it with global acquisition processes.         
	We have noted that after every DPP, industry associations make several representations and propose amendments. But we have to wait for two years to carry out the changes. Now, instead of making piecemeal changes after two years we will make the changes every year over the next few years, defence ministry spokesperson Sitanshu Kar said.        
	The defence ministry is gearing up for major purchases this year.        
	Nearly 10 requests for proposals  tenders  for fast-track equipment for coastal security in the wake of the 26/11 attacks are ready and will be issued over the next three months.        
	Imports of military hardware under the DPP will result in major spin-offs of Indian industry and the defence public sector under the offsets clause. The offsets provision mandates that the seller of equipment reinvest at least 30 per cent of the total value of a contract into Indian industry. In the case of large contracts, this could be as much as 50 per cent.        
	In anticipation of purchases and orders for the armed forces, Antony summoned heads of the defence public sector undertakings and the Ordnance Factory Board on Thursday and asked them to adhere to delivery schedules for weapons and systems.         
	Antony called the meeting specially to warn against corrupt practices. He cited the example of Sudipta Ghosh, the former director general of the Ordnance Factory Board, who was arrested in Calcutta last month on charges of bribery, and said such malpractice would set modernisation programmes back.        
	Antony also set up a committee comprising defence secretary Vijay Singh, the chiefs of the armed forces and the scientific adviser to implement a report on the restructuring of the Defence Research and Development Organisation.         
	The report, prepared by the P. Rama Rao Committee and submitted last year, recommended that the DRDO streamline its work and limit it to critical areas instead of spreading itself thin.

  - Cong to send envoys from Delhi, state leaders request legislators not to quit House        G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                          Praja Rajyam chief Chiranjeevi (left) gives a memorandum to chief minister K Rosaiah on Sunday, asking for the interests of Rayalaseema and the coasts to be protected. (PTI)                                        
	Hyderabad, Dec. 13: Chief minister K. Rosaiah has sought one more day from his 20 cabinet colleagues who want to quit over Telangana, asking them to wait till tomorrow when the Congress high command will send two emissaries to the state.        
	The ministers, all from Rayalaseema and coastal Andhra, have accepted Rosaiahs plea. Sources said the Congress core committee would meet in Delhi tomorrow morning to pick the emissaries.        
	When the ministers yesterday expressed their intent to resign over the nod given to a Telangana state, Rosaiah had asked them to wait till 2pm today.        
	The emissaries will try to defuse the situation as the resignation of the ministers would throw the government into jeopardy.         
	On the other hand, the 13 cabinet members from Telangana too have threatened to quit if the statehood resolution is not tabled in the Assembly soon.        
	The envoys will also grapple with the problem of almost half the states 294 MLAs sending quit letters to Assembly Speaker Kiran Reddy, which threatens the legislature with a constitutional crisis.        
	Of the 139 who sent their resignation, 79 are from the Congress, 44 from the Telugu Desam and 16 from Chiranjeevis Praja Rajyam Party, the Speaker said.        
	Asked if the Assembly may have to be adjourned sine die, he said he had not decided on the resignations yet, nor had the government made any suggestions on the fate of the winter session that is scheduled to end on December 23.        
	State Congress president D. Srinivas urged party MLAs to withdraw their quit letters. Else, the party will be faced with a political crisis, forcing the high command to take drastic steps, he said.        
	However, L. Rajagopal, the Congress MP from Vijayawada who has sent his resignation to the Lok Sabha Speaker, said: All 225 Congress MLAs will oppose the statehood resolution in the Assembly.        
	Desam MLAs from coastal Andhra have started a hunger strike, copying Telangana Rashtra Samiti chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao, to mount pressure on the Congress.        
	We cannot allow the Congress government to decide issues without proper debate in the Assembly or among the people of the regions, said K.U. Rao from Vijayawada.        
	Thirteen of the 20 non-Telangana ministers met for 90 minutes today to discuss the anti-statehood agitation in their districts, where samaikya (Integrated) Andhra protesters have damaged buses, torched a railway station and government offices, and blocked roads and tracks.        
	The ministers then sent two representatives to Rosaiah, promising to hear out the emissaries and also to attend the Assembly tomorrow.        
	We dont want to create any constitutional crisis; we only want to protect the interests of our people and our region, said minister Anam Ramnarayan Reddy.        
	Ten of the 13 Telangana ministers and 10 Congress MPs from the region too met and decided to start pressing for early tabling of the statehood resolution.        
	We wish our colleagues from other regions would be magnanimous when, after 60 years, our party has finally agreed to grant our long-cherished dream, information minister J. Geeta Reddy said.        
	Maoist leader M. Koteswar Rao alias Kishanji accused the Congress of enacting a drama to divide Telugus and deny the people of Telangana. Police have said the Maoists had penetrated the Telangana movement through students and other sympathisers.        
	The crisis overshadowed Rosaiahs completion of 100 days in power yesterday. He is under pressure to resign, being from coastal Guntur. Rosaiah is on record that he had warned the high command about the consequences of backing statehood, and that he had not provided any assurance on the smooth passage of the statehood resolution.        
	If a senior Congress MP is to be believed, Union law minister and party general secretary in charge of Andhra, Veerappa Moily, has betrayed the central leaderships jitters and is blaming Rosaiah.        
	The happenings (in Andhra) indicate there is no consensus. The high command was misled by the state leadership, which indicated that all parties would support the cause of Telangana, Moily apparently told the MP who met him in Delhi.

  - Incognito trip for security proof           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Chidambaram at the World Badminton Championships in Hyderabad on Sunday. (AFP)                                              
	Hyderabad, Aug. 16: At first sight it might have seemed like a security failure at the World Badminton Championships venue.        
	But no, Union home minister P. Chidambaram may have slipped in unannounced and in camouflage, with two plainclothes guards carrying concealed arms, but his burning desire was to show how fool-proof the security was.        
	I was burning inside when I heard reports of players leaving the tournament in the wake of terrorist threats, Chidambaram, who spent nearly five hours at the stadium, said alluding to the pullout by the English team.        
	I wanted to demonstrate to the world that every single player is safe in India which is capable of holding all international sports events.        
	So, he hopped into a plane in Delhi and landed at Begumpet airport this morning with his two safari-clad guards, having himself chucked his trademark dhoti for a pair of black trousers. The white shirt remained, though.        
	At the airport, he refused police escort but accepted a bullet-proof car. He drove to a hotel instead of the Raj Bhavan and within a few minutes was at the stadium.        
	He had a Rs 1,000 ticket bought for him from the counter, and then sat in the spectators gallery before the tournament organisers spotted him. The crowd cheered when they realised who he was.        
	Chidambarams actions were clearly meant to suggest that Englands withdrawal was not justified. The eight-member team had pulled out a day before the tournament began last Monday, fearing a Lashkar-e-Toiba threat. A day later, two Austrian players too left for fear of swine flu.        
	Chidambaram later congratulated the police for the fool-proof security. The state government had also taken precautions against the flu threat, making available to the organisers a medical team of 30 members, including five doctors.

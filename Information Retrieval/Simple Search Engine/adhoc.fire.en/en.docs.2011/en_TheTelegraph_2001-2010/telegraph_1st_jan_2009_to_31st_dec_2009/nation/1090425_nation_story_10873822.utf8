                                                                                                               Orissa to fight heat wave
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, April 24: A heat wave sweeping across the state today prompted the administration to adopt contingency measures to mitigate impacts.         
	Bhubaneswar today recorded a temperature around 42.8C, the highest in April since 1989. The city had earlier recorded 42.7C in April 1989 while the highest ever in April was 45C recorded in 1985.         
	Mercury hovered above 43C today, said S.C. Sahoo, the Met office director. He added that the condition was likely to continue for the next 48 hours and might extend for the next five days. A dry north-westerly wind, blowing across the state, has contributed to the heat wave, said a weather expert.         
	The Met office predicted thunder squall accompanied with hail and surface wind, with speed up to 60km per hour in coastal Orissa in the next 48 hours. However, possibility of rainfall is remote, said Sahoo.         
	Roads wore a deserted look during the day as most people chose to remain indoors. Schools were closed for the summer vacation ahead of schedule in view of the heat. Though political workers were relieved of work after the final phase of polling yesterday, polling personnel had to return to work under the scorching sun today. The heatwave has already claimed the lives two polling staff.         
	Special relief commissioner N.K. Sunderay said reports of 37 suspected sunstroke deaths had been received by the disaster management department. While one sunstroke death was officially confirmed, 17 deaths were confirmed to have been caused by other factors. Rest of the cases are being probed into.        
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik today called a meeting to review the prevailing condition and the administrations preparedness in dealing with the issue.         
	Special relief commissioner Sundaray said the chief minister directed officials to take up contingency measures to mitigate impacts of the heat.         
	He asked officials to ensure provision of drinking water in rural and urban areas and repair defunct tube-wells on a war footing.         
	In case of emergency, drinking water would be supplied to areas through tankers.         
	Health officials were instructed to be ready with ice, saline and medicines to treat sunstroke patients, while energy department officials were asked to ensure uninterrupted power supply, while water resources department officials were directed to release water in the canal to save crops.

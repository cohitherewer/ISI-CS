          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	New Delhi, Dec. 16: Unrelenting protests against price rise by a united Opposition forced the adjournment of the Lok Sabha today after MPs accusing the government of inaction disrupted scheduled discussions.        
	MPs from all non-UPA parties, including the Left, BJP, Samajwadi Party, Janata Dal (United), Biju Janata Dal, Akali Dal and the Shiv Sena, started raising slogans against the government in the House.        
	Opposition MPs also marched in front of Parliament House  inside the complex  demanding prompt government action to control the prices of essential commodities.        
	They demanded that the government initiate a debate on price rise in the Lok Sabha.        
	Price rise has already been discussed once in this session, and rules do not allow a second discussion on the same subject in one session, Speaker Meira Kumar told the protesting MPs.        
	But the MPs  who had stormed the well of the House  refused to accept her pleas to return to their seats.        
	The House proceedings were stopped twice before being adjourned for the day after the MPs refused to allow the scheduled discussions to proceed.        
	The Lok Sabha may have been stalled because of the furore over rising prices, but aftershocks of the Telangana tremors that rocked the House yesterday were also felt today.        
	Pro-Telangana Congress MPs sitting in the treasury benches held aloft paper placards reading Jai Telangana even as the Opposition MPs were protesting against price rise in the well of the House.        
	MPs opposed to the division of Andhra Pradesh  from both the Congress and the Telugu Desam Party  had yesterday used the Lok Sabha as a platform to demand that the state remain unified.        
	These anti-Telangana MPs, including Jaganmohan Reddy, son of late chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, had held banners demanding a united AP in the Lok Sabha yesterday.

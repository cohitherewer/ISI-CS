          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 17: The Environment ministry today asked the Wildlife Institute of India to identify half-a-dozen candidate sites for the possible reintroduction of the cheetah which hasnt been spotted in the Indian wild since 1947.         
	Environment and forests minister Jairam Ramesh said a group of wildlife biology experts called by the ministry had indicated that there is little genetic difference between the African and the Asian cheetah.         
	Weve been told the African cheetah can be brought in for reintroduction in India, Ramesh said. I have today asked the WII in Dehra Dun to identify six or seven areas where the animal could be reintroduced, he said.         
	The reintroduction of the cheetah in India has been debated for several years in wildlife circles and even among non-wildlife biologists. A reintroduction would require between 600 to 800sqkm of area with high prey density, said Ravi Chellam, director of the Wildlife Conservation Society in India. You would need about 20 to 30 adults for a self-sustaining population, Chellam said.         
	The cheetah would ideally require an expanse of grassland where it could hunt down prey through a chase. Wildlife experts caution that large carnivores in India have in recent years come into conflict with local human populations.         
	The minister said that any reintroduction proposal was likely to encounter questions such as why should India consider bringing back cheetahs when it cannot adequately protect its tigers.         
	Biologists at the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad, had about a decade ago proposed that India should consider acquiring an Asiatic cheetah from Iran  where they are still found  for possible cloning and reintroduction.         
	A wildlife expert said Iran appeared unwilling to provide its cheetahs to India. But scientists now say the African cheetah is more suited than the cheetahs in Iran for possible reintroduction in India.         
	Wildlife scientists say the last wild cheetahs in India were shot in eastern Madhya Pradesh in 1947.

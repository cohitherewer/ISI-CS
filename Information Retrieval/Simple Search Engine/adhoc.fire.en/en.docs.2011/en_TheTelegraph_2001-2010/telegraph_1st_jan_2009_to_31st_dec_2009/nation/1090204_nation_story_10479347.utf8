          LALMOHAN PATNAIK                              
	Cuttack, Feb. 3: The dismal performance of the BJP in the recent Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) elections is likely to cast its shadow on the Cuttack Municipal Corporation (CMC) polls set for Friday.        
	Both Bhubaneswar and Cuttack are represented in the Assembly by BJP leaders Biswabhusan Harichandan and Samir Dey, respectively, who are also state ministers.        
	BJP leaders, however, feel that the partys poor show in the BMC elections  six out of 60 in contrast to BJDs 40  will have no effect on its prospects in the CMC polls, which are dominated by local issues of altogether different nature. Its state general secretary Nayan Mohanty, who is in charge of 26 of the 54 wards, believes that the common man has been satisfied with the functioning of the corporation.        
	We will certainly improve over our performance in the last CMC elections, Mohanty adds with confidence.        
	BJP has re-nominated just six corporators and forced beleaguered former mayor Nibedita Pradhan to withdraw her nomination papers seeking re-election, apparently as a damage-control measure following intense pressure from within the party in the city.        
	City Congress president Suresh Mohapatra feels that the BJPs dwindling vote base would affect its prospects in the CMC elections. The BJP mayor could not able to do anything significant for the city, says Mohapatra. More so, for most part of the last term the council had witnessed a civic administration besieged with a relentless bickering within for ouster of the mayor, taking a heavy toll on timely civic measures for the public.        
	Dey, in charge of 28 wards, said: We have much to say about the achievements under Pradhan during the past five years and hope to get elected from a majority number of wards to form the council.        
	Pradhan said: The significant reduction in cases against CMC in the high court and initiating of vigilance inquiries in civic affairs during my tenure is testimony to efforts towards providing clean and transparent administration.        
	The term of the council, with 18 corporators from the BJP, ended on September 29 last year.         
	HC reserves order        
	Orissa High Court today reserved judgment on the dispute related to reservation of wards in CMC area under delimitation exercise.        
	The high court was hearing the petition, challenging reservation of ward No. 3 for Scheduled Tribe candidates following orders from the Supreme Court to complete adjudication on the dispute raised within two weeks.

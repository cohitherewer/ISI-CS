          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jaipur, Feb. 7: One person died as police opened fire today to quell violence triggered by the murder of a local politician in Rajasthans Churu district.         
	BSP leader Virendra Singh Nangli was shot by two assailants riding a motorcycle around 5pm yesterday when he was returning from a market in Rajgarh town of the district, 210km from Jaipur.         
	A case has been filed against unknown assailants. The BJPs Lok Sabha member from Churu, Ram Singh Kaswa, who defeated Nangli in the 2004 polls, has been named an accomplice in the murder.        
	Kaswa denied any role in the killing. I have heard that I have been named in the case but I have never seen Nangli let alone met him, he said.        
	The murder sparked off a wave of violent protests by supporters of Nangli in Rajgarh, Churu, Jhunjhunu and Jaipur. Tension snowballed in the morning when a mob tried to pelt a state roadways bus with stones in Sidmukh. When prevented by the police, they attacked the men in uniform, the police station and the hospital where the people injured in the protests had been taken.         
	The police tried to calm down the protesters, but not getting any response, opened fire.

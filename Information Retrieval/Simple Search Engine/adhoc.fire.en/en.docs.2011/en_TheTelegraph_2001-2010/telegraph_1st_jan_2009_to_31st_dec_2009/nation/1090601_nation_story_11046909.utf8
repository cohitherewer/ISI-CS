The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Congress and BSP first off bypoll blocks
                                                                                                               Congress and BSP first off bypoll blocks
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                      Rita:Upbeat                          
	New Delhi, May 31: The Congress and the Bahujan Samaj Party have begun the spadework for the 12  11 Assembly and one Lok Sabha  bypolls in Uttar Pradesh due within the next six months.        
	The Assembly seats were vacated by the legislators to contest the Lok Sabha polls. One of them was Mulayam Singh Yadavs son Akhilesh, who won from Firozabad and Kannauj. He will have to give up one of the two parliamentary seats, leading to a bypoll.        
	The Congress, upbeat after its unexpected catch of 21 parliamentary seats, has sent its observers to all constituencies, though the bypolls are expected only in September.         
	The observers are gauging if the feel-good mood is persisting and whether the party will be in a position to maintain its winning streak.        
	Uttar Pradesh Congress president Rita Bahuguna Joshi said the reports would be handed in this week. Depending on what they (the observers) say, we will decide how many seats we can realistically fight and kick off the process of candidate selection, she said.        
	Initially, the Congress was in two minds about going the whole hog for what has been billed a mini-Assembly poll, given the high stakes the four big players  the Samajwadi Party, BSP, Congress and the BJP  have in proving (or disproving) their strengths.        
	But the dilemma seems over. If we lose, people will dub our Lok Sabha performance a flash in the pan. Should we take the risk? On the other hand, theres a lot of pressure from the workers to go for the kill. They say we shouldnt desert the battleground, a central Congress functionary said.        
	Rita, though, appeared more cautious. We will do what is in the partys interest. If we get good candidates, its worth fighting all the seats, otherwise we will see.        
	Of the 11 seats, the Congress holds two  Padrauna and Jhansi  the Samajwadis five, the BJP two. The Rashtriya Lok Dal and the Janata Dal (United) hold one each.         
	The sitting Dal (United) legislator of Rari in eastern Uttar Pradesh, Dhananjaya Singh, quit the party and won from Jaunpur as a BSP candidate.        
	Samajwadi MLA Gauri Shanker also resigned after the BSP gave him a ticket from Etawah, but he lost. His father Dhani Ram Verma also quit as Samajwadi MLA from Vidhuna to join the BSP.        
	The ruling BSP, which holds none of the 11 Assembly seats, has to pull out all stops to win them.        
	For the Samajwadis, the byelections represent a now-or-never test. The least we can do is to keep our seats. We arent looking beyond that, a Samajwadi source said.        
	The BJP has displayed a similar weariness. The party had won the Lucknow (West) and Moradabad (West) Assembly seats in 2007. The first was vacated by Lalji Tandon, who won the Lucknow Lok Sabha seat. Sources said Tandon has told workers that his izzat (honour) was on trial and they must do everything to hang on to the Assembly seat.        
	After the huge win of Mohammed Azharuddin from the Moradabad Lok Sabha constituency, BJP sources admitted keeping the city Assembly seat, which the partys Rajiv Channa resigned to contest against the ex-cricketer, was a tall order. The Congress, on the other hand, is confident of cashing in on the Azhar aura and snatching the seat from the BJP.        
	But the other prestigious seat, Padrauna, may prove a bit tricky for the Congress. It was won by the young R.P.N. Singh, now a Union minister of state. Singh had battled Swami Prasad Maurya, the state BSP chief who was considered Mayavatis chosen nominee.

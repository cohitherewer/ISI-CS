          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, April 18: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said it was nostalgia that had made him say north Calcutta had the warmth that was missing in the citys south.         
	I had no intention of hurting the people of south Calcutta, he said about the remark he made on Thursday while launching a website for the CPM Calcutta North candidate, Mohammed Salim.         
	I was born in north Calcutta and made a nostalgic remark, driven by emotion. But to clear the misunderstanding, I must say that the people of south Calcutta matter a lot to me as I have been staying there for quite a long time. People of south Calcutta have a different lifestyle and they also contribute to the citys development, the chief minister (in picture) said today.        
	Bhattacharjee stays on Palm Avenue and is the MLA from Jadavpur  both in south Calcutta.

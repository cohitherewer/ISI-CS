	Actor Raghubir Yadav (left) is untraceable. The actor, who became a household name for his serial Mungerilal ke Haseen Sapney and has starred in Salaam Bombay, Lagaan and Water, had been dragged to court by his estranged wife Purnima, who is seeking maintenance.         
	A warrant was issued against him by a Bandra family court in September after Yadav failed to appear before it despite summons being sent. Police have not been able to trace him for the past two months. The police had visited the address mentioned on the warrant but could not find Yadav there.

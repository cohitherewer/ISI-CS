The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Paswan resigned to Lalu-less future
                                                                                                               Paswan resigned to Lalu-less future
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                    
	New Delhi, May 18: The fourth front appeared to be crumbling today, its three leaders speaking only for themselves as they stared at long spells without power.        
	United until yesterday in the hope they would eventually get a toehold in the new government, Mulayam Singh Yadav, Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan today tried to mend fences with the Congress separately, with little thought for the fronts solidarity.        
	Railway minister Lalu Prasad complained to Manmohan Singh in vain after the outgoing cabinets last meeting this morning that he had been insulted by various Congress leaders.        
	Amar Singh continued to do what he did yesterday  professing the Samajwadi Partys unsolicited support to the Congress and claimed he had received a call from the Prime Minister. He claimed he had spoken twice to Singh who, he said, had thanked the Samajwadis profusely for having backed the UPA after the Left withdrew support last July. But Amar didnt mention if his party had been invited to join the new government.        
	For Paswan, it was a harsh reality check. He dismissed speculation that he would contest from one of the two seats that Mulayams son Akhilesh had won in Uttar Pradesh. The LJP chief, routed in Hajipur and watching all his candidates go the same way, hinted at starting from scratch. Hum zameen ke aadmi hain (I am a grassroots man), he said after attending the cabinet meeting as steel minister.        
	The comment was being seen as an indication that the LJP would have to be revived in Bihar without any association with Lalu Prasads RJD.        
	Nasim-ur Rehman, the LJP chief of Araria where the party was thought to be on a strong wicket, told Paswan the feedback from party leaders was they would have to start working on their own.

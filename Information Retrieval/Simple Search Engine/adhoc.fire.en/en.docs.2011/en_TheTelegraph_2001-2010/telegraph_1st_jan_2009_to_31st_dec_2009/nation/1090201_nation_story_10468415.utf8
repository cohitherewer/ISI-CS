	Jaipur, Jan. 31: Jagan Gujjar, the dacoit who commanded the highest reward on any bandit since Veerappan, surrendered today, ending his reign of fear in the ravines of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.        
	Jagan may not have achieved the iconic status of bandit queen Phoolan Devi, but like Gabbar Singh in Sholay, Jagans name sure sent shudders down the spine of most who had heard of his deeds in the Dang region comprising about seven districts of Rajasthan.        
	He had been wanting to surrender for the past three days through a TV channel, but police ignored him. Today, he arrived at a fair teeming with people in Karauli, 182km from Jaipur, and surrendered before Congress MP Sachin Pilot.        
	Jagan, who had 53 cases against him, had a reward of Rs 11.5 lakh on his head, the highest for any criminal in India since Veerappans death.

  - No tobacco talk in schools          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Stub it out!                                        
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 6: Visiting your daughter or son at school? Then better stub out that cigarette and throw away the gutkha packet.        
	States school and college campuses will soon be tobacco free zones, according to a notification that has been sent to the state education department. The news of the notification was confirmed by health minister Prasanna Acharaya today.         
	The move came after Union health ministry imposed a guideline prohibiting sale and consumption of tobacco products within 100 yards of educational institutes.         
	Teachers, parents or visitors on campuses will have to abide by the rule, along with students, said a visibly elated anti-tobacco activist Itishree Kanungo of Aparajita.        
	An alarming proportion of school personnel use tobacco and students often imitate them. More alarmingly, there has been an increasing rise of tobacco use among girls. The ban should help prevent the birth of more addicts, she added.         
	The guideline states that schools and colleges have to bear a notice that states it to be a tobacco-free zone. It would also be mandatory for institutes to form tobacco-control committees that will organise lectures on effects of tobacco and make posters, hold debates and declamations during the session.        
	The move will come as a relief, if it is followed, admitted Pitambar Sethi, a teacher. Activities such as celebration of World No Tobacco Day, photo exhibitions and essay competitions on cancer should be an essential part of school, he suggested.        
	The monitoring committee will be headed by school headmaster or principal and should be formed to see that the ban on smoking is strictly followed and enforced. The committee will also see that violators are handed over to the administration.         
	The ban would be put into effect from this month and the enforcement squad would ensure implementation, said the minister. Mere laws would not work if there is no awareness, he added.

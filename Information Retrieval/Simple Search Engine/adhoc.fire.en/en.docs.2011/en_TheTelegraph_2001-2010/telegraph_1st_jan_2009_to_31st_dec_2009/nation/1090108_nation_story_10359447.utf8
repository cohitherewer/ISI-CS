The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong laps up PM hard talk
                                                                                                               Cong laps up PM hard talk
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 7: Manmohan Singhs allegation that some official agencies in Pakistan had a role in the Mumbai attacks has gone down well with the Congress.         
	Chief spokesperson M. Veerappa Moily came out in support of the Prime Ministers tough talk today, saying nice, soft language will not get any response from Pakistan.         
	It (the comment) was not a slip of tongue on the Prime Ministers part. His statements were calculated, deliberate and conscious, Moily said, echoing many in the party.        
	The Congress believes the strong message will produce the results India is looking for: underline Pakistans position as the biggest sponsor of global terror and isolate it internationally. The government, the party feels, can then leverage the ensuing advantage to force Islamabad to hand over some of the most wanted killers, if not to New Delhi then to a third country that would allow India to question and possibly try them.        
	Asked what the Congress would like the government to do, sources suggested they werent unrealistic: the hard talk wouldnt lead to war. After all, they said, 2009 was not 1971, when Indira Gandhi had unilaterally taken on Pakistan despite the USs opposition.        
	We will have to take the US, China and the UK into confidence. The US and UK, especially, are for zero tolerance of terrorism. Our minds meet on this agenda. If these countries want to show they are sincere and honest, they must stop treating the attacks on their soil as acts of terrorism and those on that of others as simply attacks, said a general-secretary.        
	Aware of the political drawbacks the perception of Indias dependence on Washington in countering its neighbour may create in an election year, the sources said it was time the Centre played hard ball with the US and conveyed it must stop hyphenating India and Pakistan.

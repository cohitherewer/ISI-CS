The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tough ragging rules on table
                                                                                                               Tough ragging rules on table
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, March 31: Even a rude remark against a fresher in college may fetch charges of ragging under draft regulations finalised by the University Grants Commission today.         
	The regulations, issued to higher educational institutions across the country late this evening, lay down the widest definition of ragging yet and punish the offence along the lines suggested by a Supreme Court panel.        
	The UGC hopes to finalise the regulations and notify them before the start of the 2009 academic season.        
	Rude behaviour is treated as part of ragging in the regulations that otherwise have incorporated the definition mooted by the apex court panel headed by former CBI director R.K. Raghavan.        
	The regulations for the first time threaten to withdraw funding and even recognition for institutions that fail to curb ragging, a demand of the court panel that the UGC and other higher education regulators had ignored.        
	The regulations will be valid not just for all central educational institutions, but for deemed universities and all state universities as well.        
	The UGCs draft regulations leave open the scope for a future central legislation against ragging, which will then work in combination with these norms.         
	In the absence of a central law, institutions are required to seek punishment for those who indulge in ragging under the Indian Penal Code, apart from their own disciplinary action.         
	All students will be required to provide school leaving certificates profiling their tendency towards violence. This will have to be given at the time of admission to a higher educational institution.        
	Students and their guardians will have to sign separate assurances  in the form of an undertaking  saying the student agrees to be punished according to the regulations and any criminal law if found guilty of ragging.        
	Each institution has to set up an anti-ragging committee that will oversee implementation of measures against the offence, and that will take decisions on punishment to be meted out to offenders.        
	A separate anti-ragging squad is to be appointed by each institution. Complaints are to be registered with the squad.        
	Institutions are also required to conduct random, anonymous surveys among freshers to glean information about seniors they are afraid of. These seniors will then be placed under supervision.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Britain bans Indian doctor
                                                                                                               Britain bans Indian doctor
                            
	London, Oct. 7 (PTI): A doctor of Indian origin has been banned by the General Medical Council (GMC) from practising in Britain after she failed an examination in child healthcare six times.         
	Suma Mondal, who obtained her medical degree from Calcutta in 1973, has been struck off the medical register after the GMC held a hearing on her credentials before the Fitness to Practice panel.         
	Mondal, 66, was under professional review by her peers since October 2001. The GMC had been checking her credentials since July 2003.         
	Her communication with patients and record-keeping was graded as unacceptable, and there were concerns about her diagnosis and treatment. The review said she lacked medical knowledge.         
	The GMC had banned her from practising medicine for a year in September 2006 after she failed the diploma in child health examination six times.         
	In May this year, she failed to attend a competency examination and was called back before the Fitness to Practice panel.

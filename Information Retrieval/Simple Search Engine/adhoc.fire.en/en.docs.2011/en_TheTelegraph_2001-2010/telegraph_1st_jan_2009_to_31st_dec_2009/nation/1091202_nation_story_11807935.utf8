          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Dec. 1: The CBIs promptness to probe the multi-crore mining scam in Orissa has virtually put the Naveen Patnaik government on the backfoot.        
	The CBI expressed its willingness to take up investigation yesterday in an affidavit in the Orissa High Court, which is hearing a PIL seeking an inquiry by the CBI into the alleged scam, even as the state government rejected the Oppositions demand for an inquiry by the central agency.        
	The affidavit follows a week after Union mines minister B.K. Handique told the Rajya Sabha that inquiries by the Indian Bureau of Mines in Orissa had found evidence of illegal mining of 55,453 tonnes of manganese and 1,957 tonnes of iron ore.        
	The mining scam has been the fulcrum of attack on the Naveen government by the Opposition for nearly four months now. The scam came to light in July and is being probed by the state vigilance, which has so far unearthed mining irregularities worth Rs 409 crore. The government had since suspended operations in 128 mines and cancelled 482 trading licences. But the Opposition has been demanding a CBI probe.        
	The government had submitted a counter affidavit to the PIL, contending that investigation by the CBI is not necessary as the state vigilance is both legally empowered and professionally competent to handle the case.        
	Further, as seen from the action taken so far, the vigilance is worthy of trust, steel and mines additional secretary Manoranjan Patnaik had stated in the counter affidavit.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Farm diplomacy in Tiger belt
                                                                                                               Farm diplomacy in Tiger belt
          JAYANTH JACOB                               
	New Delhi, July 23: The Father of Indias Green Revolution has a Lankan baby to nurture.        
	India is finalising a plan to help revive farming in Sri Lankas war-ravaged north, under the guidance of eminent agriculture scientist M.S. Swaminathan.        
	The farming diplomacy, as some in the diplomatic community are calling it, is part of New Delhis commitment to rehabilitate the Tamil-majority region after over two decades of civil war.        
	The ministry of external affairs has approached Swaminathan, now a Rajya Sabha MP, to help bring the plan to fruition.        
	Swaminathan, who is expected to visit Sri Lanka next month, said it was time to put the plan into action.        
	The external affairs ministry has drawn up a good programme for the livelihood rehabilitation of the displaced. Most of them depend on farming and fisheries, Swaminathan told The Telegraph.        
	I have studied the problem in detail, and made suggestions. Now its time to act as the sowing season begins in October, he added.        
	Such assistance isnt new. India had helped Vietnam and Kampuchea resuscitate their agriculture in their post-war days in the 70s.        
	In Sri Lanka, India could help by supplying seeds, fertilisers and pesticides, besides technological assistance in water harvesting, forestation, soil conservation and fisheries.        
	We will work with the Sri Lankan authorities to ensure the displaced people get their means of livelihood soon so they can start their lives afresh and go back to their villages from relief camps. The Sri Lankan agriculture ministry has prepared a strategy for Vadakkin Vasantham (revitalisation of the northern province). We will lend our expertise and resources, said a source.        
	Also on the cards is an agriculture university, to be set up in Jaffna with Indian assistance. This is expected to help in research and development of farming activities in the region.        
	Over 80 per cent of the population in the northern province, where farming wilted in the governments long-running war with the LTTE, live off farming.         
	The province comprises the districts of Jaffna, Killinochchi, Mullaithivu, Mannar and Vavuniya.        
	Sources said before the civil war, the province had a cultivable area of about 3 lakh hectares, of which over 1 lakh hectares were used to grow rice. The other major crops were chillies, sesame, groundnut and chillies, besides a variety of fruits and vegetables.        
	The conflict of over 25 years came to an end now (after the death of LTTE chief Prabhakaran in May). So it is difficult to gauge the exact area of cultivation. A lot of paddy fields and other cultivable areas were mined. We are now helping the Lankan authorities de-mine the areas, said the source.        
	Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa has already announced a 180-day timeframe for the rehabilitation of the displaced.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cabinet nod hope for IIMs
                                                                                                               Cabinet nod hope for IIMs
                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 26: The cabinet may tomorrow approve seven new Indian Institutes of Management promised by the UPA, paving the way for government plans to launch four of them later this year.         
	It may also approve a long-pending scheme to subsidise education loan interests for poor students pursuing professional higher education courses.         
	This year none of the new IIMs will offer the flagship post graduate diploma in management (PGDM) that is most sought after at Indias premier B-schools, HRD ministry sources told The Telegraph.         
	They will instead offer short courses in mid-career skills for working executives this year, and begin offering the PGDM courses only next year, the sources said.         
	The cabinet in its meeting tomorrow is scheduled to discuss and possibly approve the new IIMs promised in the XIth five-year plan, reports our special correspondent.                      
	period up to 2012, the sources said.         
	The government had initially promised six new IIMs  one each in Chattisgarh, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Tamil Nadu and Jammu and Kashmir.         
	But finance minister Pranab Mukherjees speech during the interim budget earlier this year erroneously promised an IIM to Rajasthan, too.         
	Ahead of the Lok Sabha polls, the government decided to take on the extra burden of starting an additional IIM instead of risking voter anger.         
	Sources said the planned IIMs for Jharkhand, Chattisgarh, Tamil Nadu and Haryana might come up this year itself.         
	The coming Haryana elections may have propelled the decision for the cabinet to consider the proposal for setting up the new IIMs, a source said.         
	Under the education loan interest subsidy scheme, the government will pay the interest on education loans of students in professional courses till they start working after completing their education.         
	All students from families with combined income less than Rs. 4.5 lakh a year are eligible under this scheme. Canara Bank has been identified as the lending institution.

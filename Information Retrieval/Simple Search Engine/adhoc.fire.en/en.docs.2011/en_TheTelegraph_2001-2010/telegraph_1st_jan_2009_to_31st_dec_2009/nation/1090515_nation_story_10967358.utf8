The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Somnath return row
                                                                                                               Somnath return row
                            
	May 14: CPM politburo member M.K. Pandhe today ruled out Somnath Chatterjees return to the party, saying the reason for which he was expelled still exists.         
	The trust vote was a crucial time when he defied the party and supported Congress. Chatterjee has not accepted the fault, he said in Delhi.         
	Chatterjee, expelled from the CPM after he refused to step down as Speaker before the July 2008 trust vote, retorted that he would never apply to the party to take me back.        
	Those who are saying I have acted in favour of the Congress, they neither understand politics nor the Constitution. They are also ignorant about the responsibilities of the Speaker. My decision was 100 per cent correct. Those who have opposed my decision have gone against the country, he said in Bolpur.

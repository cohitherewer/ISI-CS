The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Chauhan snubs Advani, keeps Mitra out
                                                                                                               Chauhan snubs Advani, keeps Mitra out
          SANJAY K. JHA                            (Top) Chauhan, Advani: Rift out in open                                 
	New Delhi, July 28: The Madhya Pradesh BJP has rebuffed L.K. Advani over the selection of Rajya Sabha candidates, highlighting the central leaderships weakening grip over the party organisation.        
	Advani had requested that one of the states two vacant Rajya Sabha seats be set aside for an outsider at a time the party is trying to get journalist Chandan Mitra, whose Upper House term ends next month, back in Parliament.        
	But today the party announced the names of Kaptan Singh Solanki and Anil Dave, both leaders from Madhya Pradesh, as the candidates.        
	Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan had insisted that the state be allowed to allot both seats to local candidates, BJP sources said. Although he used the pretext of strong anti-outsider sentiments within the state unit, insiders said the real reason was linked to Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi.        
	Chauhan has conveyed to the high command that the freedom given to Modi in candidate selection has caused heartburn in his state.        
	Modi had ignored the central leadership and fielded candidates of his choice in both the Assembly and Lok Sabha polls.        
	He hasnt allowed any candidate to be foisted on him even in the Rajya Sabha elections. The last outsider accommodated by Gujarat was Arun Jaitley, who anyway enjoys good relations with the chief minister.        
	The preferential treatment of Modi has angered most other BJP chief ministers, who have not been allowed similar freedom even in the Assembly elections.        
	Chauhan, in particular, had to struggle to win tickets for his candidates in the last Assembly polls. He appears to have used this opportunity to send a message to the Delhi bigwigs, who have been weakened considerably after the general election defeat.        
	Sources said that Advani, while requesting Chauhan to leave one seat for an outsider had not clearly spelt out his choice between Mitra and Piyush Goel, son of senior BJP leader Ved Prakash Goel.        
	Mitra, however, was the most likely beneficiary because Jaitley, leader of the party in the Rajya Sabha, backs him.        
	Advanis deputy in the Lok Sabha, Sushma Swaraj, who is now active in Madhya Pradesh politics by virtue of being a local MP, did not press for Mitra. Keen to build her base in Madhya Pradesh, she preferred to go along with the local leaders.        
	Sushma is seen as a rival to Jaitley and Modi in national politics, and so she had reason to support Chauhans position. The chief ministers are going to play a key role when the party decides on a new hierarchy in the next couple of months.        
	Party president Rajnath Singh too sided with Chauhan because of his opposition to Advani and Jaitley.        
	Mitra, victim of the larger political machinations, will have to cool his heels for a while. Party sources, however, say he would sooner or later be brought back to the Rajya Sabha because most of the senior leaders back him.

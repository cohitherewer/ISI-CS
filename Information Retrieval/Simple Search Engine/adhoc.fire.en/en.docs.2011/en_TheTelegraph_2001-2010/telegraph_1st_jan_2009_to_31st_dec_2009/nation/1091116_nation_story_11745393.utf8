	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 15: Here is some relief for vulnerable senior citizens living alone. The Bhubaneswar-Cuttack police commissionerate has finally woken up to their needs.        
	With the number of criminal attacks on senior citizens rising, the commissionerate has decided to constitute a senior citizens security cell (SCSC).         
	Elderly people, who have reached 60 years of age, can register themselves with the cell, which will tender ready response to them. The citizen must be aged more than 60 to avail this facility, said police commissioner B.K. Sharma. Details of the tenants living with the senior citizens would also be collected for verification, he added.        
	To start with, the cells will function from five police stations. Registered senior citizens  at least 150 have already been enlisted  would be visited by an officer of the cell at least once a week and the cell would be responsible for facilitating emergency medical requirement of the elderly, if necessary.        
	Earlier, policing was all about controlling law and order and keeping a tab on criminals. But things have changed now. This is an effort to construct a citizen-friendly approach, said the police commissioner.        
	The programme was organised by Age Care Associate.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Denied IIT, coaching capital shuts down
                                                                                                               Denied IIT, coaching capital shuts down
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jaipur, Aug. 10: Kota, the coaching hub whose trainees fill up a third of IIT seats every year, observed a bandh today after the state government picked Jodhpur as the site for the new IIT in Rajasthan.        
	All schools, colleges, coaching centres and markets were closed, said the towns residents, eager to claim complete support for the shutdown called by the Kota IIT Janmorcha Sangharsh Samiti.        
	Even the roadside fruit and tea sellers closed down. The sentiments of the whole of Kota have been hurt, said J. Gupta, a resident.        
	The ruling Congress, though, stayed away from the protests, as did its three ministers from the region, including home minister Shanti Dhariwal  clearly mirroring the political shades the controversy has taken on.        
	The Ashok Gehlot government had written to the Centre on Saturday, recommending Jodhpur. The government, however, has steadfastly refused to publish the report of the V.S. Vyas Committee that formed the basis for the choice. It has neither tabled the report in the Assembly nor answered an RTI application to reveal its contents.        
	The committee has been manipulated and the report is just a face-saver so the chief ministers native place gets the IIT, Janmorcha president Mahesh Chandra Gupta said.        
	The previous BJP government, led by Vasundhara Raje, had recommended Kota for the new IIT, which is now functioning from the IIT Kanpur campus. The BJP government had even acquired 500 acres of land in Ranpur, about 14km from Kota, for the purpose. A central committee, sent in 2007, too had found Kota ideal.        
	But then education minister Arjun Singh asked the Raje government to look for alternative sites. The Centre apparently doubted whether an IIT could maintain its standards if set up in Kota, whose trainees stunning success rates have brought allegations of mass cheating  a charge the coaching centres furiously deny.        
	These fears are baseless, said Pramod Maheswari, director, Career Point, an IIT coaching institute. Delhi and Kanpur too have thousands of coaching institutes but they both have IITs. How are the standards being maintained there?        
	Kota residents say that Jodhpur already has a national law university and a Central Arid Zone Research Institute, and is to have an AIIMS, so why does it need an IIT too? They claim their city has an educational environment thanks to the coaching institutes where students study 15-16 hours a day.        
	Gupta said the only thing missing was air connectivity, something the Centre could easily provide. Even Kharagpur and Roorkee, both IIT towns, lack air connectivity.        
	BJP legislator Om Birla, who wants the IIT in Kota, cited how a member of the Vyas committee, Viswanath Sinha of IIT Kanpur, had resigned citing differences.        
	Some 50,000 students come to Kotas IIT coaching institutes from across India every year, giving the industry an annual turnover of around Rs 500 crore. The students pay tuition fees of Rs 50,000-Rs 60,000 a year, their overall expenses reaching up to Rs 1 lakh.        
	About one in seven of them crack the IIT entrance, compared with the all-India rate of one in 50 examinees.

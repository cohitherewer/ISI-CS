	Dec. 4: Strife between Tamil and Kannada speakers has scuttled a Bible quiz for children in Bangalore.        
	Tensions between Catholic communities over the language used in liturgies have triggered boycotts of Masses in Karnataka in the past. Now, a Bangalore church has chosen to cancel its annual quiz rather than face a law-and-order problem.        
	The event was scheduled for November 15 at the St Francis Xavier Cathedral, but that was before the All Karnataka Catholic Christians Kannada Sangha threatened to disrupt it.        
	The Sangha claimed that during last years quiz, held at a different church, a student had passed a comment that insulted Kannadigas.        
	If they are going to insult Kannadigas, why have the event? asked J.R. Pereira, president of the Sangha, which has around 6,000 members across the state.         
	Having a Bible quiz is all right, but why drag language into it?        
	There have also been complaints that most of the prizes are bagged by Tamil children. They have the money and the authority. It should not be like that in religious matters, Pereira said.        
	Karnataka has a history of friction between Tamil and Kannada speakers. Among Catholics, the tussle between the two groups has been over each wanting its language to be given primary importance in liturgies, especially during Christmas and Easter.        
	Bangalore is just 40km from the Tamil Nadu border and has a large Tamil population, which makes up the majority of Catholics in the archdiocese.        
	The Sangha had staged a protest last year following the alleged insult, said Fr Amruth Raj, Parish Priest of St Francis Xavier Cathedral. Now, when they came to know we were having the quiz here, they sent a letter, he said.        
	The Bible quiz, which evolved from an annual visit by children to the Bible museum at the St Peters Pontifical Seminary, now has some 3,000 youngsters taking part in the programme, which includes several cultural activities.        
	More than the seminary, perhaps the children who practised (for the quiz) may be disappointed, said Fr K.J. Thomas, rector of the seminary.        
	He said the seminary had been conducting the annual quiz for over 10 years and that over the past six years, the venue had been rotated among various Bangalore parishes to ensure better participation.        
	The Kannada Sangha claims that its agitation, started in the late 1970s, has yielded results with more churches nowadays holding the Midnight Mass in Kannada during Christmas and Easter. Earlier, it was only in Tamil, Pereira said.        
	Many churches now hold Masses separately in Tamil, Kannada and English during the two festivals, staggering their timings.        
	I dont see any tension, said Reverend Bernard Moras, Archbishop of Bangalore. There might have been several years ago. In the last five years I have been here, there has been improved relations between all the people.        
	Mysore too saw a clash over issues such as the liturgical language a few years ago, and Bellary and Belgaum recently witnessed tensions over the choice of a non-Kannada bishop.         
	The Sanghas grouse is that only one of 11 dioceses in the state has a Kannada-speaking bishop, and that many of the others speak Konkani, Tamil or Malayalam.        
	The Catholic Bishops Council of India recently issued a directive asking regional churches to adapt themselves more to the local environment and culture.

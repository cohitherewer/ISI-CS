	Srinagar, Jan. 5: The gun battle between security forces and militants in Jammus Poonch district entered its sixth day today.         
	The militants have taken positions in some caves in the forests of Bhatidhar.         
	Four militants and three jawans have died in the operation being jointly conducted by the army and police.         
	A top Pakistani Jaish-e-Mohammed commander, Dawood, is believed to have been trapped in the forest area.         
	Some reports suggested that militants had constructed some bunkers in the area but defence spokesperson Colonel D.K. Kachari rebutted such claims.

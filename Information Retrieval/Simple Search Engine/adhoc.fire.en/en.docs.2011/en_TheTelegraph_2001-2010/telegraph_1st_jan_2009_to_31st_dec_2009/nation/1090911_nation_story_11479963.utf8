The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Shekhawat slams Jaswant expulsion
                                                                                                               Shekhawat slams Jaswant expulsion
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 10: Former Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat today saidJaswant Singhs expulsion from the BJP was sad, unjustified and uncalled for.         
	This is the first time Shekhawat, who relinquished his BJP membership when he took the constitutional post, has spoken on the sacking of Jaswant.        
	Even courts do not hand out summary punishments. A due process is followed. Nobody bothered to read his book. In my memory, this is the first time such a thing has happened in the BJP. Even an office peon is served a notice before he is sacked, said the 86-year-old ailing leader who has known Jaswant for 43 years. Both are from Rajasthan.        
	Shekhawat was instrumental in inducting Jaswant into the Jan Sangh in 1980. Like Jaswant, Shekhawat was considered close to Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The three were regarded as the triumvirate of moderates in the BJP when L.K. Advani was identified with the Ayodhya movement.        
	It is not as though Jaswantji has not contributed to the party. He was part of the core group that took important decisions. He has lots of supporters and their reaction has not been good because such a senior person was just evicted. It is unfortunate Atalji is ill, Shekhawat said after Jaswant, his wife and his daughter-in-law met him for the first time since the Darjeeling MP was expelled over his book on Jinnah.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Aila snub to Mamata
                                                                                                               Aila snub to Mamata
                            
	On board the Prime Ministers special aircraft, June 17 (PTI): Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today virtually rejected ally Mamata Banerjees demand to bypass the Bengal government in distributing relief to Aila victims.        
	Mamata Banerjee is an honoured member of my cabinet and we will work together. But the relationship between the government of West Bengal... and the central government is governed by constitutional norms, Singh said.        
	The Trinamul Congress chief wanted the Centre to directly distribute the relief material to the local administration.

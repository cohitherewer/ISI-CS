          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Oct. 29: A lady doctor of Lucknows premier government hospital has been booked for torturing and attempting to murder an 11-year-old girl illegally hired as a domestic help.        
	Dr Aruna Bharti of Sanjay Gandhi Post-Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences has been absconding since last night when the traumatised child, allegedly thrashed for not doing her work, had to be taken to hospital.        
	Circle officer Shashikant Tiwari of Mohanlalganj police station said yesterday that Bharti had been booked for attempt to murder and violations of the abolition of bonded labour and anti-child labour acts.        
	The medical institute has ordered its own probe. The labour department has also slapped a penalty of Rs 20,000 on Bharti.        
	Police officers found the doctors house locked this morning, prompting them to set up four teams to track her down. One of the teams has been sent to Varanasi, where Bharti hails from.        
	Social organisations and rights groups condemned the alleged abuse.        
	The incident has swivelled the spotlight on educated middle-class professionals hiring minors in child labour law violations so far known to be rampant in factories, eateries and other commercial outlets.        
	Child rights groups say the punishment isnt strong enough: the maximum penalty under the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986 is a two-year prison term and fine of Rs 20,000.        
	The Centre banned employment of children in households in 2006 through an amendment in the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act 1986.        
	Uttar Pradesh social welfare commissioner R.K. Mittal said a separate panel, the Anti-Child Labour Commission, would be formed within a month. The exercise of selecting its representatives is under way. It is high time we adopted every means to check child labour in the state.         
	According to a 2008 study by the Centres labour ministry, the Uttar Pradesh government and a private institute, the state had 1.93 million child labourers, the highest in the country. Many of these children work in the glassware industry of Firozabad and Agra, lock factories of Aligarh and carpet units in Varanasi.        
	A Unicef report released in January this year said over 1.2 crore children in India worked in hazardous conditions, and 1.85 lakh were employed as domestic helps.

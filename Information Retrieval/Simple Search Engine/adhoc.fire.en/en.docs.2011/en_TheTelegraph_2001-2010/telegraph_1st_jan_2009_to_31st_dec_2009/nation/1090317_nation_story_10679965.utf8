          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 16: A conflict over committee funds got out of hand today as residents of Kalyanpur under Macheswar police station limits locked up six policemen, before coming to blows.         
	Kalyanpur has witnessed unrest ever since a group of villagers alleged misappropriation of funds by the village committee, said inspector-in-charge Bishnu Mishra. Despite the allegation, committee members did not clear the confusion or show residents the accounts. Members also stayed off a meeting called by the villagers on March 13 to sort out the issue. Ever since then, tension has been brewing in the village with outbursts every now and then.         
	Two sections of police were also deployed in the region to avoid any incident. However after assessing the situation, police withdrew the force from the area on Saturday leaving only six policemen behind. Villagers this morning invited those six policemen for breakfast and bolted the door from outside while the guards were busy eating. They then grouped up and attacked the committee members with lathis and weapons. Four persons were critically injured.        
	A little later the six policemen broke open. As they informed their superiors at Mancheswar station, a platoon of police was rushed to the spot. Those injured  Lambodar Swain, Gurucharan Swain, Nakul Swain and Dhanu Swain  have been rushed to the KIIMS hospital here. As many as 18 persons have been arrested and raids are being conducted to nab more persons.

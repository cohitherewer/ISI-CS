	Manmohan Singh with Bill Gates at Rashtrapati Bhavan on Saturday. 
    The Microsoft co-founder received the Indira Gandhi Peace Award on behalf of his Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. 
    India faces some of the toughest health problems in the world. It bears a massive burden of disease. But in the next five years, India can make more progress on health than it has made in any other five-year period in its history, Gates said after receiving the award from President Pratibha Patil.
    He said India could address the issue if it accelerated spending on healthcare and ensured that funds were utilised in a wise and transparent manner. (AP)                            
	New Delhi, July 25: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh brushed aside suggestions of a government-party rift on the India-Pakistan joint statement and insisted that he and the Congress thought alike on the document signed in Egypt.        
	Replying to questions from journalists on the sidelines of an event in Rashtrapati Bhavan, Singh said: I have made a statement in Parliament and Parliament is again going to discuss the issue. I will clarify.         
	The Prime Minister refused to elaborate, saying it was inappropriate to answer specific questions before the Parliament discussion. We have all the relevant answers, he said.        
	Singh dismissed as media creation the reported differences of opinion between the government and the Congress on the joint statement.         
	Singhs senior colleagues in the government have set the tone of the official discourse with the home minister, P. Chidambaram, claiming that Pakistan had not given India proof of Delhis involvement in Balochistan. The Balochistan issue had swept aside the points flagged by the joint statement because this was the first time when Kashmir did not figure in an India-Pakistan joint document while Balochistan crept in.        
	The cryptic sentence that said Prime Minister Gilani mentioned that Pakistan has some information on threats in Balochistan and other areas set off a debate among foreign policy commentators and the Opposition. They expressed fears that the mention of the western province bordered by Iran and Afghanistan, beset with a history of separatism, ethnic tension and a Taliban presence, might allow Islamabad to point fingers at New Delhis subversive involvement in terror attacks in future and blunt Indias case against Pakistans support to its terror groups.        
	In an interview to a television news channel, Chidambaram challenged Islamabad to produce evidence of Indian involvement in Balochistan before levelling charges, such as those about training youths in terror camps.        
	We are not involved in Balochistan, we have nothing to do with Pakistans internal problems in Balochistan. In fact, the Balochistan leader has said that he gets no support from India. Besides, why should we get involved when we have enough problems on our western borders with Pakistan? asked Chidambaram.        
	Maintaining that every point the Opposition had raised was eminently defendable, a cabinet minister said that in the House discussion on July 29, the Centre would stress that a political dialogue  as opposed to talks between the foreign secretaries or other officials  will not re-start until Pakistan delivered more substantively on terror combat.        
	Sources turned the Oppositions case against de-bracketing terrorism from the composite dialogue process on its head, saying, Pakistan can demand that unless the political leadership resumes talks, it will not act on terrorism. Therefore, it was important to separate the two aspects of our relationship.        
	Sources said the government would restate the Prime Ministers line of how while one can choose ones friends, one has to live with ones neighbours and, therefore, dialogue and discussions on both sides of the border were necessary.        
	We will remind the BJP how Atal Bihari Vajpayee, too, had realised this early on in his innings and how he pursued talks even after serious setbacks. If we have 26/11, the BJP has Kargil, Kandahar and the Parliament attack to account for, a source said.        
	A decision to cap the speculation of a party-government breach was taken late on Friday night when the Congresss core committee met in the Prime Ministers residence. This was its first sit-in after the Egypt meeting and it was attended by Sonia Gandhi, her political secretary Ahmed Patel, Pranab Mukherjee, Chidambaram and A.K. Antony.        
	Sonia and the others were briefed on how, far from tying Indias hands, the statement allowed it more leeway to speak and negotiate with Pakistan. The leaders decided the Congress and the government will speak in one voice and the party would reaffirm its solidarity with Singh through Sonias address to Congress MPs on July 30.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CRPF withdrawn from Baramulla
                                                                                                               CRPF withdrawn from Baramulla
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Srinagar, June 30: The CRPF will be replaced by local police in Baramulla following two days of unrest, the town becoming the first in Jammu and Kashmir to witness such a switch.        
	We are replacing all the deployments of CRPF in Baramulla by armed police. Only those CRPF men who guard VVIPs or important installations will remain in the town, Kashmir police chief B. Srinivas said. The police alone will now maintain law and order, he added.        
	The late-night development, apparently initiated by chief minister Omar Abdullah, followed the death of another youth in firing by security forces.        
	A government spokesperson said that a case of murder had been registered against the CRPF jawan who had reportedly fired without any provocation.         
	CRPF authorities have been asked to hand over the jawan to the police.        
	Three people have died in Baramulla since Monday after a woman accused law enforcers of seeking sexual favours to release her husband from custody.        
	The controversy has come at a time the Abdullah government is facing a crisis over the rape and murder of two women in Shopian, where the hand of security forces is suspected.        
	It was CRPF fire that killed the youth today, Baramulla police chief V. Kumar said.         
	Three weeks ago, home minister P. Chidambaram had signalled that he favoured the handover of law and order duties to the police.

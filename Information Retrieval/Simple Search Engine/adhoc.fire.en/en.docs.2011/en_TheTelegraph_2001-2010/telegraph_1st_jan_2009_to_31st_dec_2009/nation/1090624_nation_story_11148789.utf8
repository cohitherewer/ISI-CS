          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 23: Indian Navy and Coast Guard personnel are now patrolling the coasts of Orissa on the eve of the Puri rath yatra to prevent possible terrorist infiltration through the sea route.         
	The step has been taken in the wake of the Mumbai 26/11 attacks. Terrorists had sneaked into the Indias financial capital through the sea route.        
	We have taken all precautions possible to prevent any possibility of an attack. This is the time when more than 10 lakh devotees from across the globe congregate in the town, said inspector-general of police (law and order) Arun Sarangi talking to The Telegraph today.        
	Anti-terrorist teams, bomb detection and disposal squads and sniffer dogs are being kept ready. Closed-circuit television cameras will also be installed to keep a tab on the crowd movement, said the IG. Surveillance at Nolia Sahi  a fishermen settlement  and all hotels located in the town has been intensified, he said, adding that more than 70 platoons of armed police have been deployed.         
	Security has been tightened to prevent recurrence of any stampede during the car festival. Last year, six devotees, including three women, were killed and around 20 people were seriously injured in a stampede.         
	According to eyewitness account, the stampede happened when thousands jostled to catch a closer glimpse of the deities right in front of the Jagannath temple.        
	Memory of last years tragedy has put the police on high alert. There will be tight cordons around the chariots and none will be allowed to go near the inner cordon, said the IG.

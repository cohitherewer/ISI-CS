The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJD campaign hots up
                                                                                                               BJD campaign hots up
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, April 19: If there is a pro-Naveen Patnaik wave in coastal Orissa, it is most visible in Cuttack.         
	The poll dice appears to be loaded against Congress and BJP in the district where nearly 17.57 lakh voters will decide the fate of 66 candidates in the fray for nine Assembly constituencies on April 23.        
	The campaigning, that was low-key so far, has started gaining momentum with BJD boss Naveen Patnaik touring the coastal district canvassing for his party candidates and whipping up an apparent wave in his favour.        
	I have come to you now, as I had come 11 years ago. Give me your blessings again, exhorts the BJD chief as he addresses one public meeting after the other seeking a third consecutive term as the chief minister.         
	BJD leader and former excise minister Kalindi Behera is seeking re-election from the reserved Cuttack (Sadar) seat after adjoining Salipur constituency  from where he was elected in 1977, 1990, 2000 and 2004  was de-reserved.        
	Tourism and excise minister Debi Prasad Mishra is seeking re-election for a fourth consecutive term to the Assembly from Badamba.         
	While the Congress is banking on the minority vote, constituting about 20 per cent of the total electorate in Cuttack, Naveen Patnaik seems determined to make inroads into the minoritys hearts.        
	This is also the seat where three-time elected BJP heavyweight Samir Dey is seeking re-election, against BJD Tirtol MLA Debasish Samantaray.         
	But, Cuttacks Congress president Suresh Mohapatra contesting from Barabati Cuttack also seems confident of his victory, despite BJD being the obvious favourite.         
	I hope that the conscious voters of Cuttack will consider efficiency and credibility of the candidates while exercising their franchise, said Mohapatra in his election meetings. My government introduced the rice at Rs 2 scheme for the poor spending Rs 840 crore from the state exchequer, Naveen has reminded his supporters at meetings in Choudwar Cuttack.        
	From the same seat, Pravat Biswal is seeking re-election after his constituency (Cuttack Sadar) was de-reserved, while BJD MLA Pratap Jena is seeking re-election from Mahanga after his constituency, Kissanagar, was dissolved.        
	BJD is not contesting from Athagarh after cancellation of nomination papers of four times elected MLA Ranendra Pratap Swain.

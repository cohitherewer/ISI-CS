The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ready for IAF race, waiting for Delhis nod
                                                                                                               Ready for IAF race, waiting for Delhis nod
          SUJAN DUTTA                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 5: The race for the Indian Air Force order for 126 fighter aircraft  probably the single largest military order in the world today at more than $12 billion  is set to get into the final leg of trials this summer but global aviation majors assembling in Bangalore next week will still wonder how long it will be before political and financial considerations shapes New Delhis decision.         
	The IAF first mooted the proposal for the aircraft in 2000 but the requests for tenders were received only last year.         
	For the first time the Luftwaffe, the German Air Force, will be flying into Indias airshow, Aero India 2009, with four Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft  one of the six medium multi-role combat aircraft in contention for the IAF order.         
	Air headquarters is currently evaluating the technical bids that were submitted. The IAFs inspectors and bureaucrats are expected to attend demonstrations of the aircraft both in India and abroad in summer and in winter. After the technical evaluation, for the first time in such a large order, India will also evaluate the offset  re-investment proposals  that the bidders will make. The last major IAF order  for 66 BAE Hawk aircraft took 25 years to fructify.         
	Top IAF sources admit it is going to be a long process and it is a complex job but they are also concerned that squadron strength is dipping. The IAF expects to buy 18 of the chosen aircraft in three years and build the other 108 in a co-production arrangement in India.         
	Among the contenders for the order, apart from the Eurofighter, are Lockheed Martins F-16 Fighting Falcon and Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet (which will be present with aircraft in Bangalore), Mig 35 from Russia (also likely to be present with the aircraft like it was in 2007), the French Rafale (may not bring the aircraft but is likely to have a simulator) and the Swedish Gripen (likely to have a simulator).         
	Dassault Aviation, which makes the Rafale, would be engaged in upgrading the Mirage 2000 aircraft of the IAF that may cost nearly $2 billion. The Mirage 2000 and the Sukhoi are the frontline combat aircraft of the IAF. An Israeli firm has also been competing for the order to modernise the Mirages.

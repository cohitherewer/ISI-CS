	 New Delhi, Feb. 19 (PTI): Over 60 per cent of the firms in India are still hiring and only 12.6 per cent are considering layoffs, said a survey that also predicted relatively good pay hikes.           
	The findings, released by global HR firm Hewitt Associates today, come weeks after the central labour bureau painted a grim picture with its revelation that 5 lakh jobs were lost between October and December last year because of the global economic slump.           
	But the Hewitt report also has a dark side: although 12.6 per cent of the firms are considering layoffs, the figure is likely to rise. Importantly, the number of companies considering layoffs is expected to increase further, it said.                  
	 New Delhi (PTI): The Indian Railways is preparing a list of about 100 MPs who despite reserving seats on the phone do not turn up for the journey leaving the berths unused but denying them to other passengers. The list of such MPs will be sent to the Speaker of the Lok Sabha and Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, an official said.                   
	 Islamabad (PTI): An anti-terrorism judge on Thursday remanded top Lashkar-e-Toiba operatives Zaki-ur Rahman Lakhvi and Zarar Shah in police custody for 14 days. Pakistani authorities arrested them on Wednesday for alleged links with the Mumbai attacks.                   
	 New Delhi (PTI): A Delhi High Court judge has decided not to give adjournments in cases that are over five years old to tackle case arrears. No adjournment slip will be entertained in the matters of 2004 and prior years, read a caution line on top of a case list for Justice S. Ravindra Bhat.                  
	 New Delhi (PTI): The CBI has conducted narco-analysis and brain mapping tests on the parents of Aarushi, the 14-year-old who was murdered in Noida. Officials said the tests were conducted even though a preliminary report said they were not involved.

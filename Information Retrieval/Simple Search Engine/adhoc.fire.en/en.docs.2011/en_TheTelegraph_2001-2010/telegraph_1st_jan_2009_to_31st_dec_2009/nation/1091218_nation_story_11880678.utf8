          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 17: Congress leaders from Andhra Pradesh defied the high command and marshalled forces from home to step up the decibel of their protest, forcing the adjournment of the Lok Sabha for the third consecutive day.        
	Ignoring the high commands wish to put the Telangana row aside for a while and let tempers cool, Congress MPs from Andhra Pradesh raised slogans and held up placards in the Lok Sabha to press for an integrated state.        
	Fifteen Congress MLAs from Andhra also arrived in Delhi to lobby against the division of the state. Sources said the MLAs were called to Delhi by the MPs who had been asked by senior leaders to lie low.        
	The MPs, however, want a clear directive from the leadership on the strategy to pacify their supporters back home. They pointed out that the chief minister, too, had said the Centre would have to find a way out.        
	 The people have been divided in Andhra Pradesh. There is tension in offices and the streets. Pro-Telangana and anti-Telangana people are sitting separately even in government offices. We are only reflecting this divide and the sense of frustration prevailing among our people, an Andhra MP said. The central leaders understand this compulsion but expect the MPs not to whip up passions. They have protested and expressed their anger. We have lent them ears and assured them that nothing will be done in haste. They should now try to explain to the people, instead of pouring oil in the fire, a senior Congress leader said.         
	He added that efforts would be made by the central leadership to evolve a consensus after the Parliament session.         
	In the Lok Sabha, while Telugu Desam members were in the well, Congress MPs didnt leave their seats as a grim Pranab Mukherjee and P. Chidambaram kept watch. Jagan Mohan Reddy, who joined the Desam protest on Tuesday, stood near his allotted seat.        
	The Lok Sabha couldnt function for the third consecutive day over Telangana, though members from different parties added to the turmoil over other issues like price rise and the womens quota.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Half-truth on molest cop and a promise
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Half-truth on molest cop and a promise
          OUR BUREAU                          SPS Rathore                                  
	Dec. 26: The Indian National Lok Dal is correct when it says its leader Om Prakash Chautala never promoted molester cop S.P.S. Rathore to director-general of police.        
	What it has left unsaid is that Chautala had promoted Rathore from DGP-OSD (police reforms) to state DGP or police chief on October 10, 1999, three months after becoming chief minister for the third time.        
	Haryana police has several DGPs, and Rathore had been promoted to the rank from that of inspector-general in 1994  when Chautala was out of power, as emphasised by his party recently.        
	Yet police sources and an archival search have confirmed that Rathores promotion to police chief, from the relatively insignificant post in charge of reforms, did come during Chautalas tenure.        
	Chautalas party also claims that Rathore was removed from his post after the CBI charge-sheeted him on November 16, 2000, over the August 1990 molestation of 14-year-old Ruchika Girhotra who later committed suicide.        
	But government sources said the administration had neither removed nor suspended Rathore but merely sent him on leave on December 5 after all of 19 days had passed since the chargesheet was filed.        
	It could not be confirmed whether or when Rathore, who is now 68, resumed office as police chief before retiring from the service in 2002.        
	No police officer is willing to go on record on Rathore, and the forces official website doesnt carry his profile although it has the bio-data of all past DGPs barring two others. No one was willing to explain why, or to reveal whether the bio-data were removed after Rathores recent conviction and six-month sentence.        
	That Rathore  accused of harassing the Girhotra family following the molestation complaint  was in charge of police reforms is ironical. No one could say what sort of reforms he had proposed and whether the force had adopted any of them.         
	Everyone in Rathores immediate family is a lawyer. His wife Abha is a senior advocate in Punjab and Haryana High Court and both their children are advocates  the son in Mumbai and the daughter in Delhi.        
	Rathores daughter and Ruchika studied in the same class --- section A of Class X  in Chandigarhs Sacred Heart School.        
	Ruchikas friend Aradhana Prakash, the sole eyewitness to the molestation, has demanded punishment for the school for expelling Ruchika  ostensibly for unpaid fees  at a time the Girhotras were being harassed by the police.        
	Media reports, however, have quoted state education secretary Ram Nivas as saying the Girhotras must lodge a complaint first. The family could not be contacted.        
	Hooda assurance        
	CPM Rajya Sabha MP Brinda Karat today met Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda in Delhi and extracted a promise to re- open the case.        
	The CM has promised to reopen the case and include Indian Penal Code sections that relate to abetment of suicide, she said.        
	But Karat, who was accompanied by Aradhanas parents and rights activists, said Hooda had been non-committal on two of her demands. One, a probe to unmask the politicians and officials who had shielded Rathore during the tenures of various Haryana governments. Two, dismissal of the police and government officials who had harassed Ruchikas family.        
	Hooda later told the media: I think the case should be revisited. My sympathies are with Ruchikas family. I have asked my DGP to provide security to her family. The Union law minister has said the case will be re-examined.        
	Notice to Rathore        
	The Union home ministry has slapped a show-cause notice on Rathore asking why his police medal should not be taken away and pension reduced for bringing the service into disrepute.        
	Rathore was awarded the medal for meritorious service on August 15, 1985, but was never considered for the Presidents Police Medal.        
	The matter will be placed before an awards committee on January 4. (Its) recommendation will go to the President, Union home secretary G.K. Pillai said in New Delhi, according to PTI.

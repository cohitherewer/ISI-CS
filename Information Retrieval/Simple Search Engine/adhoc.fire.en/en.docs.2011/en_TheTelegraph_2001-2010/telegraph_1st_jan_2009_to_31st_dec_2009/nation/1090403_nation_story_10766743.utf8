The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Classmates harass, girl stabs
                                                                                                               Classmates harass, girl stabs
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, April 2: Her classmates had crossed their limit, so she gave it back  with a knife.        
	Priyadarshini Swain, 15, sat on a wooden bench at an Orissa police station, a blank look in her eyes, hours after allegedly stabbing a male classmate in the leg for teasing her.        
	The boy, Sunil Behara, suffered a deep gash and was sent for a medical check-up.        
	We have seized the weapon of crime and are still interrogating the parties, investigating officer Smrutirekha Sarangi said.        
	Priyadarshini, daughter of a Balasore-based journalist, was returning home this morning from a nearby temple. On the way she had stopped to buy some apples, incense sticks and a fruit-cutting knife.        
	Around 8.30, while crossing a park, the Class X student of Niladri Vihar Saraswati Shishu Mandir, one of a chain of private schools run by the Sangh parivar in Bhubaneswar, saw Sunil and two other classmates sitting outside.        
	The boys, who Priyadarshini said were known for harassing girls, soon started passing obscene comments.        
	It wasnt the first time. I usually remain indifferent and go my way, Priyadarshini said as tears welled up in her eyes. But today, they crossed all limits. It was intolerable. I lost my control.        
	When she answered back, witnesses said, Sunil threw a stone at her. It hit Priyadarshini in the head.        
	Furious, she apparently took out the knife she had bought and attacked Sunil, who raised his leg in defence. Blood spurted as the knife cut a deep wound in Sunils leg. Residents who witnessed the incident immediately called the police.        
	Priyadarshinis brother Saroj claimed she did not attack Sunil. She only showed the knife she was carrying when he tried to kick her. It was just an act of defence, he said. If she had the intention of stabbing him, why would she stab his leg?        
	If a case is registered, all four will be first tried in the sub-divisional judicial magistrates court and then in a juvenile court, said child rights activist Rutuporna Mohanta.        
	Investigating officer Sarangi, however, said it was more likely that they would agree to a compromise.        
	Saroj hinted as much when he said his family was reluctant to file a case fearing the bad name it would bring to his sister.        
	If the families of the girl and the boys dont agree to a compromise, Sunil and his two friends could be booked under Sections 509 and 244 for eve-teasing and use of obscene language. Both offences are bailable, Sarangi said.        
	Priyadarshini could be booked under Section 324 for inflicting a wound with a sharp weapon.         
	Till evening, neither the girls relatives nor the families of the boys were willing to file an FIR.        
	A large number of people from the girls locality, however, protested at Chandrashekharpur police station against the incident and demanded strict action against the boys.        
	State womens commission chief Usha Padhi said the matter should be thoroughly investigated and dealt with according to law.

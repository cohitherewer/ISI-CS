The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Born in India, now buy in UK
                                                                                                               Born in India, now buy in UK
          AMIT ROY                                        Some of the outfits from Asdas new collection. Their prices range from pound;14 to pound;26                                 
	London, Sept. 13: UK supermarket chain Asda is tomorrow launching a range of salwaar kameez, kurtas, dupattas and churidars, aimed at its Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi customers.         
	The 13-piece collection, priced between 7 (Rs 565) and 26, will be available in 21 Asda stores in London, Bradford (where customer reaction to a sneak preview and fashion show today went really, really well), Dewsbury and other Asian areas.        
	We are hoping to have saris, too, an Asda spokesperson told The Telegraph.        
	The clothes offered by Asda are part of the George at Asda line, which is named after George Davies, who founded the Next chain and is one of the most innovative men in the British fashion industry.        
	Asda says it collaborated with a team in India from its suppliers, Poetic Gem, to design its new range of ethnic clothes which are made with authentic Indian material.         
	The supermarket also received inputs from a panel of customers and says the styles are suitable for all cultures, not just Asian customers, but is expecting to see a high demand for Id. At this rate, it will be hoping to attract Bengali customers, too, before the pujas.        
	Fiona Lambert, the brand director at George, said: We are extremely proud to be launching the UKs first mainstream range of traditional Asian clothing. We have the broadest socio-demographic group of all the supermarkets and we wanted to offer affordable clothing suitable for all our customers.        
	She added: Our ethnic food ranges in Asda have seen a 46 per cent year-on-year increase during Ramazan and were expecting huge demand in the build-up to Id and Diwali celebrations.        
	Product endorsement was provided by Brianna Ragel, the editor of Asian Woman magazine, who said: It is exciting to see a well-known high street retailer embracing ethnic cultures and offering good-quality authentic outfits at affordable prices. This definitely marks a turning point for ethnic clothing on the high street.        
	Asda says the clothes, which are also available online, are a response to demand from the supermarkets ethnic customers for affordable authentic Asian clothing.         
	However, Indian and Pakistani garment stores in such areas as Southall, Ealing, Wembley and Green Street in London, which have built up a flourishing trade over the past 40 years, will be dismayed by serious competition such as that offered by Asda.        
	But since there are 1.5 million Indians in the UK, plus 1.6 million Muslims of whom more than 1 million are Pakistani or Bangladeshi, it no longer makes sense for supermarkets to ignore an important source of revenue in recessionary times.        
	This has been the experience in Canada where Asdas parent company, Wal-Mart, also launched a Bollywood-inspired collection earlier this year. Sunil Mittals Bharti group, which has a deal with Wal-Mart, is also involved in advising on the UK collection.        
	Wal-Mart Canada corporate affairs director Kevin Groh said: We were blown away by the attention brought on by the launch of our range of South Asian influenced clothing  from industry watchers to media to our ethnic customers. Strong sales aside, the buzz and goodwill that continue to surround the line have been absolutely remarkable.        
	Bollywood Signature was designed in-house by Ranka, an existing Wal-Mart Canada supplier owned by Canadians of Indian origin.        
	The move did not go down well with Vancouver clothing shop owner Sunny Khurana, who felt threatened just as his Indian and Pakistani counterparts in Britain will do.        
	The pie is only that size, and if theyre going to take part of that pie, theyre obviously taking business away, said Khurana.        
	The Asda spokesperson said: We wont take trade away from anyone. Our range is basic. It for Mum shopping and she wants to pick something up quickly as a treat.        
	Asda clothes may in future be seen on British soaps such as EastEnders since the government yesterday signalled it is to remove the ban on product placement in an effort to help commercial television channels get through the bad times.

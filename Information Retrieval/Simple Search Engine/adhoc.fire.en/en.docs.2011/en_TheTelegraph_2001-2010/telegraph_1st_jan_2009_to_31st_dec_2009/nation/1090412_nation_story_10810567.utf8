The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Look whos interested a bit and why
                                                                                                               Look whos interested a bit and why
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI IN NEW DELHI                              
	Sharp at 9.45pm on April 7, final-year IIT Delhi student Ankush Verma closed his books, left the institute library and headed briskly for his hostel to catch the late-evening election specials on television.        
	The TV set in his hostel common room is usually tuned in to popular English or Hindi movies but these days, he says, the post-dinner choice in the hostel is usually news.        
	Both the news and the newsmakers are entertaining. I guess thats why election coverage is interesting, Verma laughed. But a little probing, and the sense of insecurity driving the interest in the elections spilled out.        
	Verma, among the toppers in his class, would have walked into a garden of job offers last year with at least a seven-figure starting salary. But this is 2009, India is caught in the global economic meltdown, and even the celebrated IIT brand is struggling to attract the companies and the offers of previous years.        
	Its true a prime reason I am following the polls closely is to see how the major parties plan to tackle the economic crisis, Verma said.        
	Only in a few instances, however, is the interest of the IIT or IIM student likely to extend beyond mere spectatorship or commentary on the political process.        
	One of the exceptions is IIM Calcutta student Harsh Vardhan Chapparia, who has joined L.K. Advanis war room in Delhi as an intern under the tutelage of Sudheendra Kulkarni. Final-year IIM Ahmedabad student Srijan Pal Singh has applied for an internship under Rahul Gandhi during the polls. He, however, is yet to join any strategy team, the Congresss or the young Gandhis.        
	Most IIT and IIM students, though, will not even be voting. Classes will be on at most IITs through most of the five phases in which the country will vote. The majority of IIT students are from areas far from their institute and are unlikely to miss class and go home just to vote, said Mohammed Sarfraz, a second-year student at IIT Powai who is from Jamshedpur.        
	Attendance rules are strict and I cant imagine any of my friends skipping two days and spending their own money to travel home just to vote, Sarfraz said.        
	Most IIM students will be doing internships during the polls; only those fortunate enough to have found internships in their hometowns will be in a position to vote.        
	Skipping the internship is out of the question since everyone is keen to please the company where they intern. It is extremely hard to get a job one wants in these times, said a final-year IIM Kozhikode student who will begin interning in the Mumbai office of a multinational next week.        
	Last year, when Barack Obamas campaign for US President was at its peak, campuses across the US transformed into volunteer centres where students worked through the nights to urge voters to back Obama. The University of Colorado was covered in posters of red and blue carrying Obamas message of hope.        
	At IIT Delhi, the only hint that a national election is on can be found on the TV screens in hostel common rooms. Only one in 20 students this correspondent spoke to even knew that Jairam Ramesh, a key poll strategist for the Congress, is an IIT alumnus.        
	Is it because India does not have an Obama? According to IIM Bangalore dean Trilochan Sastry, the question itself is flawed.        
	Hundreds of IIT and IIM alumni are involved in various forms of public service, including NGO work and the civil services. A group of IIT and IIM alumni, under the banner of the Bharat Punarnirman Dal, is contesting 40 seats this election. It has contested several Assembly polls in the past few years.        
	Sastry and several other IIM faculty members are themselves leading a campaign for greater transparency in the election process.        
	Their organisation, the Association for Democratic Reforms, is analysing and releasing to the public details of the declared assets and past criminal records of all candidates state-wise. The idea is to empower voters with as much knowledge about their candidates as is possible before they exercise their choice.        
	When students wanted to join the freedom struggle, Mahatma Gandhi told them to first focus on their books. We dont need to emulate the Americans in their poll campaigning methods, Sastry said.        
	Students have all their lives left to participate politically, in my opinion.

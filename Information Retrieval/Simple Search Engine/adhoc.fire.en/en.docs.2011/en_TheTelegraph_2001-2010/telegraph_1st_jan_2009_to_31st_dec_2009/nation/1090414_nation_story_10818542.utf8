          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Police clear a roadblock put by Maoists on the way to the bauxite mine in Damanjodi on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	Bhubaneswar, April 13: Police commandos began searching for Maoist rebels in forests near Asias largest bauxite mine after the insurgents killed nearly a dozen jawans during a failed night-long bid to seize huge stocks of explosives meant for quarrying.        
	Orissa police said bodies of 11 CISF jawans and four extremists, including a woman rebel, were found from the spot in Koraput districts Damanjodi, over 600km from state capital Bhubaneswar.        
	Two critically hurt jawans were airlifted to Visakhapatnam today while the rest of the wounded personnel were admitted to local hospitals.        
	Sources said exchange of fire was continuing till evening between the commandos airlifted to the area and the Maoists in the dense forests about 10km from the mine.        
	State police chief Manmohan Praharaj, who visited the battle zone, said around 200 Maoists had attacked the Nalco mine last night to loot the explosives but didnt succeed as the CISF jawans, though outnumbered nearly 10 to 1, put up a brave fight.        
	Sources in state-run Nalco said the magazine, where 12 tonnes of gelatin sticks and ammonium nitrate were stocked, was intact.        
	A senior Nalco official told The Telegraph nine tonnes of explosives in a mini truck the Maoists had hijacked 5km from the mine had also been found intact.        
	Nalco chairman-cum-managing director C.R. Pradhan said the attack was a setback to the companys security system. But thank God, the properties of the company, including the explosives, were protected.        
	Police officers had yesterday voiced fears that if the Maoists got their hands on the explosives, used to blast mines, the threat to elections in the region would increase.         
	The Maoists are boycotting the polls. There was also the fear that the explosives could find their way to neighbouring Naxalite-infested Jharkhand. Police sources said 30 to 40 rebels could still be in the forests while the rest might have fled to Narayanpatna, a Maoist base, or crossed over to bordering Andhra Pradesh.        
	Union minister for mines Sis Ram Ola praised the bravery of the jawans and said the attack would not affect production activities at Nalco.        
	Nalco employee Manoj Swain said the rebels struck around 9.30pm, minutes after a change of shift. Suddenly, a group of armed people, including women, barged in. They asked the employees to come to the canteen and locked us up there. Then some of them drove towards the explosives depot in a Bolero.        
	Another employee, Chandra Sahu, said some of the women militants asked him to cut off the electric supply. I pleaded my inability to do so.         
	CISF sub-inspector S.K. Jahiruddin said a group of armed people suddenly surrounded him. They tied my hands from behind and asked me to sleep on the ground.        
	The encounter at the mine continued through the night. Employee Simanchal Tripathy said he heard gunshots till about 6.15 this morning, when the Maoists started retreating into the forests. By 7am, CRPF and Special Operations Group personnel had freed the 100-odd employees held captive.        
	A red alert has been sounded in Koraput district and all roads in Damanjodi have been sealed, DIG (south-western range) Sanjib Panda said.         
	CISF director-general N.R. Das has reached Damanjodi.

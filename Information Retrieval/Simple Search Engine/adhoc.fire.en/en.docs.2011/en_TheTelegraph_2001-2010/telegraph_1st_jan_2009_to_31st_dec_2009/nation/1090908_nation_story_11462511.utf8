	Gaya, Sept. 7: Police today interrogated Magadh University staff regarding an alleged university appointment racket and an incident in which an auditor was threatened.         
	Magadh University Vice-Chancellor B.N. Pandey, absconding for the past week, is the main accused. Gaya SP Sushil Khopde has also withdrawn Pandeys bodyguard.        
	Bodh Gaya deputy superintendent of police and investigating officer Rajvansh Singh today visited the university office and spoke with officials associated with appointments. Singh also went through relevant files. When contacted, Singh confirmed that he had been to the university office.         
	According to sources, the universitys establishment section has washed its hands off the appointment business. The officials have said that the illegal files were not initiated or disposed by them, rather the process was done from the office of the Vice-Chancellor.        
	Even the former Magadh division commissioner, K.P. Rammaiah, in a report had stated that the establishment section was by passed by the Vice-Chancellor and the racket was carried out from the VCs residential office.

	Mumbai, March 26 (PTI): Aishwarya Rai Bachchan has declined to endorse Barbie on her 50th anniversary citing lack of time.        
	A statement issued by her spokesperson said there had been several attempts to immortalise her as the celebrity doll since she won the Miss World title in 1994 but she had to refuse because of other commitments.

	Patna, Feb. 23: CPI(Maoist) rebels killed a village headman, Niraj Kumar Mukhul, after ransacking villages in the Rohua panchayat area of north Bihars Sheohar on the India-Nepal border, 150km from here last night.        
	Sheohar and bordering East Champaran police have jointly launched a manhunt to catch the men responsible. This is the 12th mukhiya to be shot in the region in the past five years.        
	Raids are on to nab the Naxalites, said East Champaran superintendent of police Umesh Kumar.        
	The Naxalites are believed to have created a strong base in as many as 50 villages in Sheohar-East Champran-West Champaran districts bordering Nepal.         
	Sources in the police admit that the open border allowing the free movement of people between Nepal and India has proved to be a big hurdle to check Naxalite activities in the area.        
	Deployment of Seema Suraksha Bal along the porous border has failed to cut ice, as the red guerrillas keep on moving back and forth from India to Nepal, and vice-versa, often disguised as businessmen, villagers and travellers.

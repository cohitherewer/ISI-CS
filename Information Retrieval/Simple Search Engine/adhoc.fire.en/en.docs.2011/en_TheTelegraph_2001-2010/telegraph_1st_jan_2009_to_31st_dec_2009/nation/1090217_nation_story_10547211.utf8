The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Top court clears air on bandh ban
                                                                                                               Top court clears air on bandh ban
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 16: The Supreme Court today again clarified that bandhs or complete shutdowns were illegal but strikes and hartals were not.        
	You dont seem to understand the difference between bandhs and strikes, the court said, dismissing a petition by a Chennai resident.        
	Bandhs are illegal (but) not strikes, which are only a way of raising objections.        
	The petition had sought action against political parties that had called a general strike across Tamil Nadu on February 4 to press for a ceasefire in Sri Lanka.        
	On February 3, the same bench had refused to stop the parties from going ahead with their programme, saying: What can this court do? Everybody has a right to express their feelings.         
	This had created confusion in some minds and the court attempted to clear it up today.        
	The Supreme Court had in September 2007  10 years after it upheld a Kerala High Court ban on bandhs  distinguished clearly between strikes and bandhs (which it termed complete shutdowns).        
	It had said parties could no longer pass off bandhs as strikes or hartals, which are directed against specific organisations or institutions. It asked Tamil Nadus DMK-led alliance not to hold what it had termed a strike but what the court, from its leaders media statements, thought would amount to a bandh.        
	The now-rejected petition against the February 4 general strike too had argued the organisers were trying to pass off a bandh under a different name. Their real intention is to close down Tamil Nadu (as is) evident from their subsequent utterances, it said.

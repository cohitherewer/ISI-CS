The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Samajwadi snub to Cong, again
                                                                                                               Samajwadi snub to Cong, again
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 12: The Samajwadi Party today snubbed the Congress some more by unilaterally announcing another five Lok Sabha candidates from Uttar Pradesh.        
	Mulayam Singh Yadavs party has now declared 51 candidates for the states 80 Lok Sabha seats without consulting or informing ally Congress. If the Congress is still serious about the alliance, it has just 29 seats left to choose from. Samajwadi officials said the Congress could at best expect 12 or 15.        
	A Samajwadi source, privy to the candidate selection process, said the seats finalised were non-negotiable.        
	A Congress leader, however, hoped better sense would prevail on Mulayam and Amar Singh, and they would consider pulling their nominees out of seats over which the Congress had stronger claims.        
	The Samajwadi source said: We have told our candidates to start working in their constituencies. The BSP and the BJP are way ahead of us.... We cant suddenly bring in a new face just because the Congress wants one.        
	The source said the Samajwadis had done the Congress a favour by leaving Amethi, Rae Bareli, Sultanpur, Farrukhabad and Pratapgarh untouched.

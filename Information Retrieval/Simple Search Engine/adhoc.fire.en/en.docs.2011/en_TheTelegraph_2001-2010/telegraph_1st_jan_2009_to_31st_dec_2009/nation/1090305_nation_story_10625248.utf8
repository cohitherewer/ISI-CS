	Bhagalpur, March 4: A mob lynched two unidentified robbers and assaulted two more in Bhagalpur today.         
	One of the young men who was beaten up was being taken away by police, when he was brought down from the police jeep and thrashed. Police are yet to identify the two deceased, while one of the two injured has been identified as Anil Goswami, of Lakhanipokher village. The police have been on a lookout for Anil, as he escaped from the prison ward of the JLN Medical College and Hospital, Bhagalpur, in 2008.         
	According to Bhagalpur deputy superintendent of police Ramanand Prasad, a group of six attempted to loot tracks and tractors at Basudevpur Baul Ghat on the Andheri, 21km from Bhagalpur headquarters, in the afternoon. The attempt was made while drivers were busy loading sand from the riverbed.        
	When the men noticed the attempt, they chased the robbers up to Ratanganj haat, a weekly market, some 2km from the river. The robbers reportedly fired in air to disperse the market crowd, injuring one Fakia Devi, hailing from Ratnaganj.         
	The firing angered the crowd and two men were lynched on the spot, while another who managed to flee to the nearby Sultanpur, was chased and then beaten up. A Kajrali police jeep, called in by the Ratanpur village chief, gave the fourth robber a chase.        
	The young man was caught and identified as Anil. But when the jeep reached the market with Anil in it, the mob brought him down and thrashed him badly.         
	Police, from nearby Sajour police station finally managed to rescue him. Anil and his accomplice were rushed to the JLN Medical College and Hospital.        
	They went in to a coma, said a doctor.        
	Superintendent of police Bacchu Singh Meena said investigations have started to identity the rest of the robbers, as well as the people responsible of the lynching incident.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Rita Bahuguna Joshi waves to a crowd at Moradabad railway station on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, July 16: When Rita Bahuguna Joshi was arrested this morning, one was hard put to find a single Uttar Pradesh leader who sounded mildly sympathetic about her.        
	This, despite the fact that she is the daughter of the legendary Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna, one of the Congresss tallest leaders in the heartland until he parted ways in 1976 to join the Janata Party.        
	Not that the Uttar Pradesh Congress members were fond of Mayavati or professed the Dalit cause or had a problem with Ritas utterances. In the two years she has headed the Uttar Pradesh Congress, Ritas record has been far more impressive than her predecessors.        
	The Congress registered a quantum leap in the Lok Sabha polls, its workers are appropriately charged to make the final assault in the Assembly elections due in 2013 and the organisation is getting back in shape.        
	Ritas bosses in Delhi believe that if Sonia Gandhi and Rahul deserve credit for the gains, Digvijay Singh, the general secretary in charge of the state, and Rita cannot be grudged their little share. And that little share actually means a lot in the party because not only is Uttar Pradesh the Gandhis political turf, an engagement with the state means unbridled access to the partys first family.        
	Mohammad Azharuddin was quick to pick his way through the maze that led to 10 Janpath when he discovered that Rita was one of the best guides. She reportedly put in a word with the Congress president and Azhar got his ticket.         
	Like Azhar, Rita too figured out quite early in her political career that if she remained on the right side of the Gandhis, she wouldnt have to worry much about what the rest thought of her. Then, she had most of the attributes it took to make it to the top or close to it.                  
	She had pedigree and degree  a PhD in history from Allahabad University and a teaching stint at her alma mater. She was also personable and had the right measure of ambition, aggression and articulation. Until the Ghaziabad gaffe, that is.         
	Her entry into the Congress wasnt easy, though. In 1995, when she decided to join politics and reclaim her fathers legacy six years after he died, the Congress refused to field her for the mayoral election in Allahabad. She contested as an Independent and won with the backing of the non-Congress and non-BJP parties.        
	The success spurred the Congress to reach out to her and it fielded her from Sultanpur in the 1998 Lok Sabha elections. But she lost. She then crossed over to the Samajwadi Party soon after and was re-elected mayor.        
	Rita rejoined the Congress after it came to power at the Centre in 2004 and replaced Salman Khursheed as the state party chief.         
	Luckily for Rita, that coincided with Rahuls induction and involvement in Uttar Pradesh that opened the first, albeit small, window of chance for a revival.        
	Rita was given a free hand to reconstitute the state Congress. Unfortunately, there arent too many of them because she doesnt inspire loyalty with her school mam ways, said a Congressman from Allahabad.        
	Nobody could accuse the mild-mannered Rita of being abrasive, though. Which is why the only explanation being proferred for her remarks on Mayavati was they reflected her Brahminical mindset.         
	Yes, Rita comes from one of Uttar Pradeshs top-drawer Brahmin khandaans but those who know her closely swear she wasnt brought up as one. Her mother Kamla was a Kayastha.

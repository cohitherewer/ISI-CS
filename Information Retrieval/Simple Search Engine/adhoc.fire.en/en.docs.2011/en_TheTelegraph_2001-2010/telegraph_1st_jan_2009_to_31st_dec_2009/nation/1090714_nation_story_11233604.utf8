	Calcutta, July 13: The condition of CPM veteran Jyoti Basu has improved and he would be shifted out of the ICCU to a general cabin tomorrow, doctors said today.        
	His condition has improved considerably and all parameters are stable. Although his gastrointestinal problem is persisting, we are planning to shift him out of the ICCU tomorrow, said a doctor who is part of the seven-member team treating the 95-year-old CPM leader. He is speaking normally and having food, the doctor said.        
	The medical board members are satisfied with the progress of the patient, said T.S. Kuckrejja, the executive vice-president of AMRI Hospital, Salt Lake, where Basu was admitted yesterday morning after suffering from transient loss of consciousness.         
	Today, Basu had a soft diet, including mashed rice and boiled fish for lunch and soup for dinner. He is having some complaints regarding irritable bowel syndrome, Kuckrejja said in a medical bulletin.        
	A CT scan of the brain was carried out today and it showed considerable resolution of the earlier subdural haematoma, which was detected in the left half of his brain. The clot formed after he fell in the bathroom in June 2008. Basu also underwent colonoscopy but nothing negative was detected.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee went to meet Basu in the evening. Earlier in the day, railway minister Mamata Banerjee visited Basu.         
	His condition is stable. He was awake when I went to his cabin. I asked Basu how he was and he gestured that he was fine, Mamata said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP shifts from Ram to aam aadmi 
                                                                                                               BJP shifts from Ram to aam aadmi 
          SANJAY K. JHA                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 17: The BJP may have harped on the Ram temple recently to stir up its core constituency, but the partys prime focus in the next election is economic crisis and the resultant problems.         
	The leadership is convinced that expanding the partys appeal is impossible without tapping the general discontent among the ordinary people.         
	In its effort to snatch the aam aadmi from the Congress, the BJPs election agenda has replaced emotive issues like the Ayodhya temple and Muslim appeasement with a bouquet of livelihood-related issues that includes high prices of eatables, increased cost of living, unemployment, job losses and salary cuts.         
	L.K. Advani, the BJPs candidate for Prime Minister, told the parliamentary party meeting today to talk to common people about their daily problems and convince them that the election was the best opportunity to take revenge.         
	He asked his MPs to highlight the UPAs betrayal and explain to them the grim realities of the unprecedented economic downturn.

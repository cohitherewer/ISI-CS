The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Palace run beats slump
                                                                                                               Palace run beats slump
          RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR                              
	Jaipur, Aug. 4: Beating the recession, the Palace on Wheels will set off tomorrow, almost a month before its first scheduled run of the tourist season.        
	The Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation, which manages the super-luxury train as a joint venture with Indian Railways, said the idea behind starting the train earlier is to bridge the five-month gap between seasons (April to September) which seems too long.         
	Also, since the initial response the tourism corporation received after proposing to launch it sooner than usual was good, it went ahead with its August run. We have got 40 per cent booking for the August run which is quite good considering the economic slump, said Manjit Singh, the corporations managing director.        
	The tourism corporation had decided to make August the lean season, instead of September, and bring down the tariff. For example, the cost of double occupancy per person per night from September 2009-April 2010 is $500, while for August, the rate was made $375.        
	The ploy appears to have worked since the train has a reasonable booking.         
	The publicity for the August run began almost a year ago, when the meltdown had begun impacting the West  most of the trains guests are foreigners  but even then the train found takers.        
	Not only that. The peak season run is booked 85 per cent, and this despite the tariff being raised across slabs by $100.        
	Singh, the corporations MD, said the rates have been raised after two years. He justified the increase, saying the coaches had been overhauled and the washrooms and air-conditioning system refurbished according to feedback collected from passengers.         
	The curtains and linen had been changed, the exterior been repainted. Around Rs 40 lakh had been spent on the trains renovation, Singh claimed.        
	The trains itinerary has also been changed to ensure tourists get more time off it than on it.         
	Tourists would now get to see Jaipur by night instead of during the day. They will have dinner at the five-star Jai Mahal Palace instead of munching on the train.

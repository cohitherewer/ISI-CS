	Bhubaneswar, April 3: Sharad Pawar wasnt there, but leaders of the BJD, Left and NCP shared the dais at a rally today, symbolising a new political alignment ahead of the general elections.        
	BJD and NCP leaders, however, made it clear that the Vijay Abhijan Samabesh (joint victory campaign) should not be viewed as a third front event, but a convergence of like-minded forces.         
	CPM general secretary Prakash Karat said the new alliance in Orissa, led by BJD, would not only show a new direction to the state, but also have a far-reaching impact on national politics.         
	He dismissed BJP stalwart L.K. Advanis theory of bipolar politics and stressed on the need for a third alternative. Blaming the economic policies of the UPA government for the growing poverty, price rise of essential commodities and joblessness, Karat said it had only benefited a handful of big business houses.        
	Ridiculing the Congresss promise to provide rice at Rs 3 kg per kg to BPL families, the CPM leader said some states like Orissa had already implemented Rs 2 per kg rice scheme for the poor.        
	Castigating the BJPs Hindutva agenda, Karat said: If the saffron party comes to power, it will try to create thousands of Kandhamal. He called upon the people of Orissa to reject both the Congress and BJP and elect BJD chief Naveen Patnaik for the third consecutive term as the chief minister and the third front at the Centre.        
	Veteran CPI leader A.B. Bardhan echoed Karat in praising Naveens efforts to take Orissa on the development path.        
	Naveen will play a very significant role in the formation of a non-Congress and non-BJP government at the Centre, CPI secretary D. Raja said at the rally.        
	NCP chief Sharad Pawar, who was unable to attend because of a technical snag in his aircraft, spoke to the gathering over phone. I would have loved to be there to address the rally, but Im stuck in Nasik, he said. The NCP was represented by party general secretary D.P. Tripathy.        
	Stating that political equations are changing fast with NDA and UPA getting weakened, while regional parties are growing stronger and set to play a crucial role in national politics as well, Naveen appealed to the electorate to vote BJD and its allies to power and give a befitting reply to the BJP for its communal politics and defeat the corrupt Congress.        
	If Orissa has remained backward, it is because of the corruption and weak administration of previous Congress regimes. You must ensure that the Congress does not come to power, he said.         
	He said his erstwhile ally and its associate organisations had tried to destroy Orissas religious and cultural fabric. They turned against us when we tried to stop them, he added.        
	Forward Bloc leader Naren De said Orissa would show a new direction towards building up a third alternative built by secular forces.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Kalyan Babri circus begins 
                                                                                                               Kalyan Babri circus begins 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Kalyan                                  
	Lucknow, Feb. 4: Kalyan Singh today said he had taken moral responsibility for the Babri demolition, in an apparent effort to mollify Muslims nettled by the Samajwadi Partys decision to befriend him.        
	The statement came a day after Dar-ul Uloom clerics refused to talk directly to Samajwadi general secretary Amar Singh. Seminary students later told him Muslims could never forgive Kalyan for his role in the demolition.        
	Let me clarify that I had taken moral responsibility for the Babri Masjid demolition and stepped down from my post as chief minister, Kalyan said.        
	All Muslims as well as members of other religions are respected citizens of the country and everybodys honour should be protected.        
	Sources said Samajwadi chief Mulayam Singh Yadav called up Kalyan last night and asked him to apologise to Muslims after Amar updated him about the sentiment of the Deoband clerics.        
	Do something about it, a source quoted him as saying.        
	Since Kalyan quit the BJP and built up a friendship with the Samajwadis  he has not joined the party but will campaign for it  there has been discontent among the Muslims.        
	The Samajwadis are jittery the friendship might cost them minority votes.        
	Kalyans statement, however, seemed to have cut little ice with the community. What is the point of him resigning when he was sacked? asked Maulana Mohammmad Idris, a cleric.        
	Kalyan explained that his friendship with the Samajwadis had only one motive: stopping the BJP from coming to power.        
	My friendship with the Samajwadi Party should be welcome to all those who want to wipe out the BJP. Those who are opposing it are directly or indirectly helping the BJP, he said.        
	Political circles are seeing Kalyans statement as a virtual apology. Sources said he could not have been direct because he has deposed before an inquiry commission and cases are pending in courts.

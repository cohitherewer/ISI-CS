The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Clerics to be tapped to fight foeticide
                                                                                                               Clerics to be tapped to fight foeticide
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 25: The Centre is planning to take the help of Muslim clerics to create awareness on education and health, inspired by a Bengal government scheme to try out every possible way to modernise the minority community.        
	An official in the minority affairs ministry said the plan involved training imams from across the country to act as campaigners for social welfare that would include efforts to check female foeticide and the practice of taking dowry.        
	Religious leaders can play a great role in creating awareness among members of the community on matters related to health and education. People listen more to maulvis and imams than to a government employee. So we thought of using this link, the official said.        
	We have seen that whenever religious bodies take up social causes, they have come up with better results, the source added. When clerics joined hands for the polio campaign in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, the results were better.        
	The official said the inspiration came from the governments of Jammu and Kashmir and Bengal which conceived similar schemes. But those schemes could not succeed much as they did not have a national perspective, he said.        
	As part of its initiative, the ministry is planning to ask state governments to send a list of religious leaders who can be trained. State-level training sessions will also be held.        
	States can use their own criteria to choose the clerics. All we want is that they should be able to pass on the message effectively, the official said.        
	The All India Imam Sangh welcomed the drive. We welcome the programme. We will be happy to assist the government in all ways possible. Our only complaint is that the government has been a bit late in realising our significance in social welfare, said Abdul Hameed Illyasi of the Imam Sangh.        
	For instance, he said, if an imam tells parents to take their child to get polio drops or to send them to school, the parents will certainly listen. The same may not happen if an official says the same thing.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Guild weighs Jet offer to take back pilots 
                                                                                                               Guild weighs Jet offer to take back pilots 
          PTI AND OUR BUREAU                      A Jet Airways employee with a placard requesting pilots to come back on duty in Mumbai. (PTI)                          
	Sept. 10: Jet Airways and its pilots have hammered out a broad understanding to break the strike deadlock, PTI reported tonight.        
	The development came hours after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh enquired about the crisis at a cabinet meeting and was given an update by civil aviation minister Praful Patel.        
	The understanding was reached shortly after a meeting between the chairman of the private airline, Naresh Goyal, and Congress MP Sanjay Nirupam who took up the cause of the pilots.         
	According to the tentative agreement reported by the news agency, the four pilots sacked by the management will be taken back and resume duties. The registrar of trade unions will take a decision on the status of the National Aviators Guild (NAG) spearheading the agitation, PTI added quoting aviation sources.        
	The management had earlier ruled out taking back the four pilots. The pilots had rejected the demand for disbanding the NAG.        
	Sources said the broad contours of the understanding had been communicated to the NAG members, about 200 of whom were huddled in a guesthouse in Mumbai, for their consideration.        
	The NAG president, Girish Kaushik, said he was hopeful of a solution during the conciliation talks between the management and the pilots convened by the chief labour commissioner in New Delhi tomorrow.        
	Over 230 Jet flights, including 37 on international routes, were cancelled today. In Calcutta, out of 19 Jet flights, 17 were cancelled.        
	Rein in fares: Govt        
	Earlier in the day, the Centre asked airlines to keep fares at last weeks levels amid reports of overcharging because of the Jet strike. But the carriers said the perceived high ticket prices merely reflected the rush and they were not deliberately charging higher rates.        
	Airline officials said the directorate general of civil aviation, which wrote to all carriers today, was aware that ticket prices hadnt been raised. There are fare buckets (bands), starting with the cheap seats, which are sold out first. Prices get closer to the full fare as seats fill up, an official said.        
	He denied suggestions that airlines had started fleecing fliers stranded because of the pilot strike at Jet.        
	We are not milking anyone but continuing with a fare system in use for the past several years and which is being followed all over the world. No one writes letters when seats go begging at the cheapest fares, the official said.        
	According to some reports, airlines are charging an average of Rs 9,000-10,000 and a maximum of Rs 15,000 on the Mumbai-Delhi route, among the countrys busiest, because of the crisis at Jet.        
	Travel agents said the rush sparked by Jets cancellations could have prompted airlines to stop or reduce discounts.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Under fire, Buddha replies to Mollah
                                                                                                               Under fire, Buddha replies to Mollah
          BISWAJIT ROY                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 2: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today defended his industrialisation policy following a tiff with his most vocal critic in the party, land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah.        
	Mollah had criticised the chief minister at the state committee meeting yesterday for reckless invitation to foreign direct investment, without naming the Indonesian Salim Group, which confused the rank and file, particularly farmers.        
	Today, Mollah pulled up the government for taking an ambiguous line on the Salim Groups Barasat-Raichak road project as finance minister Asim Dasgupta had not made it clear whether the government had decided to scrap the project or shelve it.         
	Sources said Mollah refused to accept the panchayat department in view of his differences with Bhattacharjee and Nirupam Sen after being sounded out by party state secretary Biman Bose. The portfolio was taken off Surya Kanta Mishra.        
	Replying to Mollah and other critics in the concluding address, Bhattacharjee said he had only followed the party line. The debate was already clinched in our party congress and the invitation to FDI for industrialisation, development and job generation is part of the partys accepted line. The party had also made it clear that our governments would not be able to practise socialism in states under this federal structure, a source quoted the chief minister as saying.        
	Bhattacharjee did not mention the Salim projects. However, he took a cautious position on industrialisation, stressing on heavy manufacturing units as well as small and medium industry.         
	According to the participants, he said the government would try to implement ongoing projects but would avoid big land acquisitions, particularly if they involved fertile land.        
	Some participants said the chief minister did not make a commitment on whether the government would go in for land takeover if a big-ticket private sector project was involved or follow Mollahs line who had ruled out in the Assembly such acquisitions.        
	The state committee later asked the government to take a more clear policy on land acquisition and rehabilitation of land-losers, reflecting the differences within the government and party.        
	On the organisational front, Bose highlighted the need to promote younger leaders with stress on tribal groups, minorities and women.        
	Sources said some veteran district party secretaries were likely to be dropped, particularly in Hooghly, Purulia and South 24-Parganas. One of them, Purulias Nakul Mahato, today expressed his desire to step down, the participants said.

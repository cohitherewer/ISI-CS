The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Fear follows fame in Taregna
                                                                                                               Fear follows fame in Taregna
          NALIN VERMA                          Students try out special glasses at Patna. (Deepak Kumar)                                  
	Patna, July 20: The 75-bed four-storeyed referral hospital at Taregna is ready for the astronomers and the scientists, while the sun temple nearby is gearing up for a puja to lessen the pain to be felt by their god, who is set to suffer as he rises on Wednesday.        
	Taregna today was torn between fear and excitement, science and superstition.        
	The science and technology department has opened up a special counter at Taregna to help astronomers travelling here from France, Italy, Germany and England, to eatch the total solar eclipse, besides Nasa and Isro officials, said chief minister Nitish Kumar, as he returned from his field visit from the village, 25km from Patna.         
	The eclipse has been a blessing for the small village on the Patna-Jehanabad-Gaya road. Nitish Kumar recently announced a proposal to start a knowledge university to be named after Aryabhatta, who was a Taregna resident and who in Aryabhatiyam postulated that the earth was round and revolved on its axis. That was 476AD.         
	In the Eighties and Nineties the villages claim to fame was as a Maoist den.         
	However, the total solar eclipse that would be visible from Taregna for 3.48 minutes has put the village once more on the map.        
	The event has brought glory back to Taregna where Aryabhatta had once set up his observatory, Nitish Kumar said, adding: We will do everything in our power to equip Taregna and ready it to greet scientists and astronomers once more.        
	Despite the government and scientists being upbeat about the event, a sense of trepidation hangs over the village.        
	Jab bhagwan surya par graham lag raha hai to aam admi ka kya hoga (If the sun god can wane, think what calamity will fall upon the lesser mortals), said Anil Kumar, the secretary of the Taregna sun temple. To emphasise upon the enormity of the situation he whispers: In the Mahabharat the battle took place during a solar eclipse.         
	Others are ready to fight the evil moment. We will undergo ritual bathing thrice during the eclipse and will keep praying till the sun god gains his full power. Afterwards foodgrain and clothes will be donated to the poor and Brahmins, said Ranjit Kumar a villager.         
	While the villagers make their own arrangements, the district administration has fully sanitised the newly built 75-bed referral hospital (yet to open) to accommodate scientists, tourists, Nasa and Isro officials, besides journalists.         
	Security has been deployed around the hospital and officials, too, have been pressed into service to take care of visitors, said Patna magistrate Jitendra Kumar Sinha.         
	Srikrishna Science Centre (SSC), which is the national science museum under the Union ministry of science and technology, will be helping a total of 25 researchers of Nasa and Isro to watch the event.         
	The centre will also help students and visitors to view the eclipse from the Gandhi maidan.         
	We have distributed special glasses for free in all schools of Patna and adjoining areas, said SSC director Anurag Kumar, adding: The astro-photographers from Calcutta too have contacted us for using our telescope.         
	The secretary, science and technology of the Bihar government, Ravikant, attended a special meeting with district officials to talk of safety and security especially for those visitors who would be travelling here from abroad.        
	Nitish Kumar too has decided to stay in Taregna with his officials and security personnel to watch the even on July 22 morning.

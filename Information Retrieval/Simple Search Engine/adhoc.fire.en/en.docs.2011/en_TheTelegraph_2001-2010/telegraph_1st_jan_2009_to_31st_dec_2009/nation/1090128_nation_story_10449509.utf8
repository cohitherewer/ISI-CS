	Los Angeles, Jan. 27: Indian-origin Mandhir Gupta and 45 other doctors as well as paramedics meticulously planned the births for weeks. As the date approached, they held two practice runs at Kaiser Permanente Bellflower Medical Center in Los Angeles.        
	They didnt want any surprises.        
	But they got one anyway yesterday morning when it came time for the delivery.         
	We had plans for seven babies. Then we found baby H, Dr Karen Maples said. My eyes got to be the size of saucers.         
	It took only five minutes  from 10.43am to 10.48am  for all six boys and two girls to be delivered and processed lovingly through an assembly line of medical workers.         
	The mother and her medical corps had made history. It was only the second known delivery of octuplets in the US, physicians and experts said.         
	The orchestrated delivery went off without a hitch, said Dr Harold Henry, the hospitals director of maternal and foetal medicine and a member of the delivery team. The babies are all doing well and the mom is also doing well....        
	The doctors said the children, born nine weeks premature, were in incubators in stable condition. Their weight ranged from 0.68kg to 1.47kg.        
	Five of the infants are breathing on their own, the doctors said. One has needed some help breathing, while two are attached to respirators.        
	Even medical experts who study multiple births were in awe at the situation in Bellflower, about 24km southeast of downtown Los Angeles.         
	Richard Paulson, the director of the fertility programme at USC Medical School, called the event unbelievably rare. When people use fertility drugs, 80 per cent even then are single births. The vast majority of the others are twins.        
	Still, fertility experts consider the birth of more than two babies with fertility medication to be a serious complication, Paulson said. We do not ever intend to give someone octuplets. Apparently the mother made the decision to carry all eight babies to viability.        
	The mother, who was stable, did not want to be identified. She and her family declined to talk to reporters and it is unknown whether she used fertility drugs.        
	Six girls and two boys were born to the Chukwu family at Texas Childrens Hospital in Houston in December 1998. The mother, Nkem Chukwu, went into labour 15 weeks before her due date. The smallest of the children died a week later. The others recently celebrated their 10th birthdays.        
	As the date for the Bellflower births approached, the team of doctors, nurses and assistants was assembled. Four delivery rooms were made ready. We did drills, preliminary dry runs to make sure we had everything in place for these seven babies, Maples said.        
	Then came the surprise.        
	Were counting (umbilical) cords, and lo and behold, there was another one, Henry said. It was a shock, added Maples, the teams lead surgeon. My eyes were definitely wide.        
	At a news conference last evening, the team leaders  Maples, Henry and Gupta  beamed like new parents themselves.        
	It was a truly, truly amazing delivery, Maples said. We have been talking about this delivery for weeks on end. Thats why when we discovered the eighth, we were so well prepared.        
	Gupta, who graduated from the Government Medical College, Patiala, said he expected the babies to remain in incubators for up to eight weeks. The first 72 hours are crucial, he said, but blood pressure is very good, their heartbeat is very good.        
	The mother, who delivered the babies by caesarean section, is planning on breast-feeding all eight infants, Gupta said.

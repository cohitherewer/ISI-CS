          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 16: A 19-year-old housewife was allegedly raped by three men in front of her mother, two of whom the women may have known, police said today.        
	The women were apparently asleep when the trio  one is believed to be a close relative of a local CPM panchayat member  knocked on the door.         
	When the mother opened the door, they pinned her to the floor and took turns to rape the daughter, a complaint lodged by the victim at Kultali police station yesterday said.        
	The incident occurred around 11pm on Wednesday at Purba Radhaballavpur in South 24-Parganas, it added.        
	The victim, who had come to her mothers place the same morning from her husbands Joynagar home, has been admitted to M.R. Bangur hospital for medical tests. No one has been arrested yet.        
	Hospital superintendent Subhashis Saha said initial investigations revealed injuries in and around her private parts. More tests will be done.        
	We have collected various samples from the affected parts of her body and will carry out serological tests. It will take roughly a week to complete all the tests, he said.        
	Ajey Ranade, the district superintendent of police, said a case of gangrape had been started. We are looking for the persons named by her. We are also waiting for the medical report, he said.        
	We suspect the mother knows the men because she opened the door at such a late hour. The victim later told us she recognised two of them. One is a close relative of a local CPM panchayat member, another police officer said.        
	Our inquiries have revealed that the women knew two of the three persons.        
	The police are investigating whether the gangrape was the fallout of rivalry in the village.

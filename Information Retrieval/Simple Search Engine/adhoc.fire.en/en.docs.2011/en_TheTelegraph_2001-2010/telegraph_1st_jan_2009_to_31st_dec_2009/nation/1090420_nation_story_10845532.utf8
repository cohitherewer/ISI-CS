The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Naveen set for proxy war in poor belt
                                                                                                               Naveen set for proxy war in poor belt
          SUBRAT DAS                              
	Patkura (Kendrapara), April 19: This politically sensitive Assembly constituency in Kendrapara district is all set to witness a proxy battle between chief minister Naveen Patnaik and his political bte noire Bijoy Mohapatra.        
	Mohapatra is out to avenge the humiliation inflicted on him nine years ago by Naveen, who is making a question of Patkuras self-respect.         
	The political stake of Naveen is so high here that he today addressed two rallies alone  one at Korua and another at Derabis.        
	The BJD chief had successfully managed to keep his political arch-rival Mohapatra out of bounds of the Assembly for nine years of his rule. But this time, Mohapatra is making frantic efforts to enter the Assembly, while for Naveen it has been a prestige issue to see the defeat of his principal foe at the electoral battle.        
	Naveen has fielded an old warhorse and former minister Bed Prakash Agrawal to take on Mohapatra. Veteran Agrawal has been elected to the Assembly thrice from neighbouring Kendrapara constituency since 1977.        
	Incidentally, both Mohapatra and Agrawal were close associates of Biju Patnaik and both were his cabinet colleagues in the early 90s. But they did not have cordial relations and Agrawal later crossed over to the BJP after Bijus death, while Mohapatra was instrumental in the formation of the BJD.        
	Ironically, Mohapatra, who had been consecutively winning this seat for four terms since 1980 and enjoying the No. 2 slot in the BJD, was shocked to see on the eve of the 2000 Assembly polls that his party ticket was withdrawn at the last moment in a dramatic fashion so that he was forced out of race.        
	However, Mohapatra avenged the betrayal by supporting Trinamul Congress candidate Trilochan Behera and ensured the defeat of Naveens protg Atanu Sabyasachi Nayak at the hands of Behera with a margin of over 36,000.         
	But he could not enter the Assembly, as Behera did not resign to make way for his mentor.        
	Meanwhile, Mohapatra formed an outfit Orissa Gana Parishad and fought the 2004 Assembly polls. Though he was backed by the Congress he was defeated by BJDs Nayak.        
	Last year, in order to bolster his political fight against Naveen, Mohapatra had engineered merger of his outfit and state unit of Janata Dal (Secular) with Sharad Pawars NCP to form an alternative to ruling BJD-BJP combine. But his electoral strategy got topsy-turvy with break of the BJD-BJP alliance and Pawars decision to support Naveen.         
	Sensing that he would be kept out of the Assembly with the tacit support of his party boss, Mohapatra quit NCP and crossed over to BJP. Now he is contesting on BJP ticket.        
	Mohapatra obviously harps on the second betrayal of Naveen to keep him out of the Assembly in order to arouse sympathy among the voters.         
	Naveen, however, refrained from making any personal remark on Mohapatra in his speeches today. He criticised the BJP for its communal politics and corruption and misrule of the Congress, while highlighting the development plank of the BJD.         
	BJD candidate, Agarwal also faces the outsider tag. His lack of touch with voters has proved to be his disadvantage. But the veteran politician is banking on past five years development work, besides Naveens popularity to score over his rival.

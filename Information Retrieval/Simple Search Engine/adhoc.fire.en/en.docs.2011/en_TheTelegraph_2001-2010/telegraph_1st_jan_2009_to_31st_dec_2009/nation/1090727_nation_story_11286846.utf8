The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Singh tells the world an open secret
                                                                                                               Singh tells the world an open secret

	Visakhapatnam, July 26: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said he was honoured to be present here today on the occasion of the launch of Indias first nuclear submarine, announcing to the world that the country was developing such a capability now enjoyed by only five other nations in the world.        
	The Prime Ministers words were the first acknowledgement from the Indian governments leader, 25 years after the project was officially begun but more than 30 years after it was conceptualised.        
	Singhs wife, Gursharan Kaur, ceremonially unveiled a plaque on the vessel moored inside the Ship Building Centre at the naval dockyards here. The submarine is now put to water for trials. It will take at least four years for it to be operational.         
	It is said to be not only nuclear-powered, that would enable it to stay undersea for weeks, possibly months, depending on supplies and crew fatigue, but it would also be armed with nuclear warheaded missiles.        
	The Chief of Naval Staff, Admiral Sureesh Mehta, explained its significance. This is the third and final leg of our nuclear triad. It meant that India had the capability to launch nuclear weapons from land and from the air but the INS Arihant was now arming it with a massive second-strike capability.        
	India follows a doctrine of no first-use of nuclear weapons. Intrinsic to the doctrine is the development of a credible nuclear deterrent  a weapons platform capable of surviving a first strike from an adversary and launching a massive second strike in retaliation. A nuclear submarine, Indias military planners believe, is the answer because it is silent and undetectable.        
	Here on the 10th anniversary of the Kargil war of 1999 in which the Indian Army drove out Pakistan-backed intruders from the rare heights in Jammu and Kashmir, the Prime Minister said: We do not have any aggressive designs nor do we seek to threaten anyone. We seek an external environment in our region and beyond that is conducive to our peaceful development and protection of our value systems. Nevertheless, it is incumbent upon us to take all measures necessary to safeguard our country and to keep pace with technological developments worldwide.        
	The first official admission of the project nearing completion came this February from defence minister A.K. Antony during the Aero India show in Bangalore.        
	Antony, referring to Indias non-aggression and no first-use nuclear policy, said the situation in the region had necessitated the need for a credible second-strike capability.         
	Atomic Energy Commission chairman Anil Kakodkar, asked whether India would get enrichment and reprocessing (ENR) technology, said: We should not be targeted. We are non-proliferating. I hope we have the same status as the G8 countries.         
	The G8 had recommended to the Nuclear Suppliers Group earlier this month that ENR should be restricted to Nuclear Proliferation Treaty signatories but US secretary of state Hillary Clinton had said in Delhi that India should not worry.        
	The reactor of the Arihant is to generate 80-odd megawatts. It needs highly enriched (above 20 per cent) uranium as fuel. But it has to be refuelled only after 8-10 years.        
	Under the pact with the US, Indias military and civilian nuclear programmes must be clearly separated. ENR technology for civilian energy cannot be used for military purposes.        
	A question mark remains on the sustainability of the military nuclear capacities. India has domestic reserves of uranium that are not adequately mined.

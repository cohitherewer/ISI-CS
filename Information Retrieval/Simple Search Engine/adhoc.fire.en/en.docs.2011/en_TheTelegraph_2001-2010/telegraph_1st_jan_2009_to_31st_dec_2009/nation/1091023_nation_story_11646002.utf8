The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Outsider in Mumbais political cesspit
                                                                                                               Outsider in Mumbais political cesspit
          SHYAM G. MENON                          NCP workers in Mumbai celebrate the UPAs victory in Maharashtra. (PTI)                                  
	The war began much before October 13. Like an earthquake running backward, the fault lines of battle converged on my cellphone.        
	Every half hour it beeped with a text message, praising some candidate. A highly respected social worker had his name flaunted by two people in opposing camps. Half the text messages were in Marathi, a language I dont speak. It didnt seem to matter for those sending; my phone number was adequate.        
	All they wanted was a vote, which was as faceless as my phone number.         
	Once every week, bands of supporters drove through my Navi Mumbai housing society. It was always driving, never walking; a procession of motorbikes to enamour the youth, jeeps and cars for the elders.         
	Who should I vote for? a friend asked. We were elsewhere, in Mumbai; same realities. She thought a while and found her answer: I dont want my vote to be wasted or misused. I will give it to some Independent.         
	Her predicament reflected the outsider  unwanted people with wanted votes. Hers was still the first layer of un-belonging; those who miss belonging culturally, eventually find belonging in the rat race.         
	Both my friend and the Independent dont know what being rootless in adopted city and native town alike is. What do you do with such people, the tribe of no co-ordinates or shifting co-ordinates? The nomads brought up believing in the Constitution and free India.         
	The weakest voice in the battle for Mumbai has to be that of the city. In the clamour of its separate constituents, the genuine needs of the metropolis remain unheard. Fascination is for the arithmetic of polls or as one senior journalist remarked shamelessly: Even a hung Assembly means lot of news.         
	Manifestos may have mentioned the city but the only thing centre stage was Bal Thackerays legacy. The Shiv Sena chiefs physical presence in politics had diminished with age. He has a tiger to bequeath. His son was courting a more inclusive agenda; his nephew having launched the MNS was pushing the hard-line alternative.         
	Brilliant strategy if seen from the perspective of hazarding future direction but for the present, the two silos are marketed iron clad and irreconcilable. Yet in a world where every politician is measured by his following, what the Thackerays are dont count. What mattered was what the Maharashtrian community thought.         
	The split was hot topic for my friends. Outsider, I listened for trend and tenor. A youngster from Dadar summed up his neighbourhood: The Sena complains, they do the work and the votes go to MNS.         
	The differentiator was charisma, ironically the only constant in the Shiv Sena story. It has style, something both people and media alike find irresistible forgetting the violence it spawns.         
	As the Thackeray battles set the tone for election coverage, the city faded from the agenda lost to brinkmanship. In a culture where every God has one dozen names, celebrity-producer Karan Johar apologised for saying Bombay in his film.         
	Raj Thackeray etched his campaign platform speaking in Marathi to an English news channel. Uddhav countered speaking in Hindi to an English news channel. It was now a Mumbai election in mere dateline. For all matters, it was a family feud from one community and its impact on everyones seats.         
	Divisions characterised the ruling government. On the eve of the elections, Ashok Chavan topped popularity in a survey. His coalition was familiar and disliked; it had ruled through floods, bomb blasts and terrorist attacks. Late in the day, he too had attempted the usual formula  a costly monument to Chhatrapathi Shivaji.         
	However, Chavan was new at the helm and so far, low profile. That probably made a difference in the sea of known entities and predictable agendas, including his predecessor.         
	But it doesnt mean much in a politics where meeting the new has meant a new face and no more.

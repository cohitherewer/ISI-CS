The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Chauhan jumps to Advani defence
                                                                                                               Chauhan jumps to Advani defence
          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	Bhopal, June 18: Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan has jumped to the defence of the beleaguered L.K. Advani ahead of the partys national executive scheduled over the weekend.        
	Chauhan held a meeting of senior leaders, including Sushma Swaraj, Sunderlal Patwa and Kailash Joshi, at his residence to discuss the electoral debacle. The report will be submitted at the national executive in Delhi.        
	The meeting saw the leaders citing various reasons for the defeat that ranged from over-confidence to wrong feedback to mismanagement.         
	Chauhan made it clear that neither Advanis leadership nor his choice as the BJPs candidate for Prime Minister contributed to the partys less-than-satisfactory performance in Madhya Pradesh. The BJP managed to win 16 of the 29 seats. In 2004, its tally was 24.        
	Rather, Chauhan said, he was misinformed by a few state ministers assigned to supervise the polls in their respective districts. The ministers reportedly kept telling Chauhan the party would do well but the results showed otherwise.        
	Leaders who attended the meeting said they were intrigued by Chauhans sustained defence of Advani, who is under pressure to step down as leader of the Opposition. It was, however, BJP chief ministers, Chauhan included, who had requested Advani to reconsider after he had resigned post the May 16 verdict.        
	Sources said Chauhans defence could be ascribed to his roots as a disciplined RSS worker who is bound to defend his leader, come what may.         
	But, the sources said, other leaders maintained silence.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sangh all for star, BJP a tad uneasy
                                                                                                               Sangh all for star, BJP a tad uneasy
          SANJAY K JHA                           Javadekar                                  
	New Delhi, March 28: A section of senior BJP leaders has misgivings about Varun Gandhis instant stardom but the party is firmly standing behind the latest poster boy of Hindutva because the controversy triggered by him suits its immediate electoral politics.         
	The BJP had to fall in line also because Varun received unstinted support from the RSS leadership and the Sangh parivar workers on the field.        
	While the frenzied response of workers was on display during the surrender drama in Pilibhit today, BJP leaders said many candidates from the Hindi heartland, Orissa and Maharashtra had asked for Varun to campaign for them. The party, convinced of Varuns victory, might send him as campaigner to a few places.        
	The BJP, however, is being cautious in its response to the controversy for fear of legal wrangles. After Varuns surrender, spokesperson Prakash Javadekar merely said: The law has been followed. How can someone stop an individual from following the rule of the land?         
	Javadekar added: Varun is following what is prescribed in the law.         
	The BJPs aim is to make the most of the controversy without declaring its intent. Its spokespersons claimed senior leader Kalraj Mishra was asked to be present on the spot to ensure the model code of conduct was not violated. The BJP did not even allow its cadres to display the party flag during the Pilibhit procession.         
	But the RSS is under no such legal obligation and its response reveals the BJPs true game plan.         
	The latest issue of RSS mouthpiece Organiser, which hit the stands this evening, has an unusually long editorial devoted exclusively to this subject. It hit out at the Election Commission, the secular parties, the media and individuals such as Priyanka Vadra, who had advised cousin Varun to read the Gita properly.        
	The editorial said: Gita, of course, is not a treatise on pacificism for Priyanka to advise Varun to read it. It can only strengthen his conviction. It is more a doctrine of war against evil, to protect ones dharma even if that brings death. Perhaps Ms Vadra might have thought the Gita read like the Bible.         
	It objected to Sonia Gandhi visiting temples and asked the family to declare its faith.         
	The RSS, which has just got a chief more ideologically committed than his predecessor, argued that Varun would have gone scot-free had he talked about protecting Shahabuddin, Mohammed Afzal or Ajmal Kasab. The issue is not the use of religion in politics but the use of wrong religion, the editorial said.

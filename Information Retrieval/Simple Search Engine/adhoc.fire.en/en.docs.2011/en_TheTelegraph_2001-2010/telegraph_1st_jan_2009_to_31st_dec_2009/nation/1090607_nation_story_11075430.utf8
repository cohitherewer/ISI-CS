The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP smells a scam link
                                                                                                               BJP smells a scam link
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 6: The BJP today asked Manmohan Singh to clarify alleged links between defence scam accused Ramesh Nambiar and an official in the Prime Ministers Office.        
	BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad did not identify the PMO official by name but described him as a very, very senior civil servant.         
	He claimed that Nambiar was close to this official and enjoyed free access to the PMO.        
	Later, BJP sources added that the PMO official had received an extension after the election results.        
	Nambiar, an additional general manager with Air India, is an accused in the Rs 6,000-crore artillery purchase scam unearthed by the CBI, in connection with which former Ordnance Factory Board chief Sudipta Ghosh was arrested in Calcutta last month.        
	Nambiar was a frequent visitor to the PMO, Prasad said, adding that the BJP had found out that the records of his visits were being erased. Prasad said the Prime Minister should explain Nambiars links with and access to the PMO.        
	Nambiar used to be private secretary to Suresh Kalmadi in the P.V. Narasimha Rao ministry. He was sacked from the Commonwealth Games management panel after the CBI raided his Mumbai flat and confiscated Rs 23 lakh in connection with the defence scam probe.         
	Nambiar is charged with helping Ghosh, who retired in April, open a bank account in Singapore to stash money received as kickbacks in defence deals.        
	Prasad, who demanded a time-bound and thorough probe, said Nambiar was not senior enough in Air India to even get an appointment with the civil aviation secretary, and so it was surprising that he enjoyed free access to the PMO.        
	The BJP leader said entry into the PMO is governed by a protocol so strict that even MPs have to seek an appointment. An entry is made even when ministers arrive for cabinet meetings.

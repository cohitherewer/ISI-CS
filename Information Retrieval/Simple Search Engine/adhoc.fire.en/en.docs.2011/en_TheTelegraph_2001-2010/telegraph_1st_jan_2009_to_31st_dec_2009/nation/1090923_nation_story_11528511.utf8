          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 22: Journalists from Maoist-hit regions of the state today submitted a memorandum to chief minister Nvaeen Patnaik, demanding unconditional release of a fellow scribe, who was arrested on charges of having alleged Maoist links.        
	Receiving a tip-off, Mohana police under Gajapati on Sunday raided a Berhampur-bound private bus and seized a packet containing eight pages of rebel literature addressed to Laxman Chaudhury, a local journalist.        
	Both Chaudhury and bus conductor Pradip Kumar Patra were arrested and forwarded to jail under Sections 120(b), 121, 121(a) and 17 of the IPC which covers charges such as waging war against the government, sedition, criminal conspiracy and assisting Maoist activities.        
	For the past two days, journalists from Gajapati, Ganjam, Kandhamal and Rayagada been have been sporting black badges and blocking the NH-5 demanding Chaudhurys unconditional release.        
	They have alleged that the police action was aimed at creating panic among media persons posting a threat to the freedom of the media at large. The protestors have urged Naveen to take immediate action. Instead of locating the source of the packet, police are targeting Chaudhury, said Dwijen Padhi of Paralakhemundi Press Club in Gajapati.         
	However, police have justified its action. According to a preliminary probe report there was enough evidence against Chaudhury, said Gajapati SP Sanjeev Arora.        
	Earlier, a journalist in Rayagada and another in Nuapara were implicated in serious criminal charges.        
	If our demands are not met with we shall be forced to come to the streets, read the memorandum, copies of which were addressed to Naveen, director-general of police, revenue divisional commissioner (southern division) and deputy inspector-general of police (southern range) and was signed by senior journalists and press club members.

	March 4: The Centre today put the onus on states to decide whether they could provide security for the Indian Premier League after the cricket board refused to reschedule the games.         
	A day after home minister P. Chidambaram said he would like the IPL to be put off till after the election, the BCCI said it was ready to do without paramilitary forces as an extra layer of security.        
	We will have a four-level security in any case  the paramilitary forces would have been an added cover. But if they are not available, we will have to do with the security available, said a source in the board which sent a letter to the ministry yesterday.        
	The home ministry, which till yesterday had taken a hard stand, opted for the middle path today, pointing out to the BCCI that state police chiefs had asked the Centre for two to four companies of paramilitary forces during IPL matches.         
	In its reply to the BCCI today, the ministry ruled out paramilitary force deployment for matches in view of the election. The Centre is deploying over 65,000 troops.         
	The ministry officials are learnt to have told board mandarins they should consult the states where games are to be held if the tournament cannot be rescheduled.        
	Sources said if the states agree, the Centre could shrug off any bad publicity.         
	In its letter to the home ministry, the BCCI said it did not need paramilitary troops but could not disappoint over 100 million people and jeopardise Indias chances of hosting the T20 World Cup.         
	A T20 match takes only four hours, a ministry source said, quoting the BCCI letter. The letter said the schedule was finalised before February 26 and that logistics were done.         
	BCCI and IPL officials said the league did not need the home ministrys consent, just their co-operation.        
	The tournament cannot be postponed under any circumstances  Rs 1,000 crore is at stake, said an official.        
	As of now, IPL has four levels of security  the prime being private security provided by South Africas Nicholls Steyn amp; Associates and state police personnel, who guard and sanitise cricket stadiums. The next rung is the private security arranged by franchisees and by the hotel where players and officials are put up.        
	Calcutta police too are caught in a date dilemma with three matches of the Kolkata Knight Riders scheduled between May 6 and 13. Howrah goes to polls on May 7 and Calcutta on May 13.         
	The police today urged the Knight Riders to come up with fresh dates. They have agreed, said Calcutta police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti.        
	Jay Mehta, co-owner of the team who met Chakrabarti today, said the dates would be finalised soon.

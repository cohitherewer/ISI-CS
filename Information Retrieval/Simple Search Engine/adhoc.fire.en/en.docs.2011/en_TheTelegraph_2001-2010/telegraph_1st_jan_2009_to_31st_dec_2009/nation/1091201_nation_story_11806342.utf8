	London, Nov. 30 (PTI): In the UK for an MBA, at the gurdwara for free food.        
	Hundreds of Indian students unable to find part-time work to fund their stay and studies in England have been forced to eat in gurdwaras, according to a BBC Radio 5 documentary. The findings come at a time the number of Indian students has gone up three times since the points-based immigration system was introduced in April.         
	Many struggling students flock to the gurdwaras in Southall for food. The documentary featured Nitin Walia, a student who has sought refuge in one of the gurdwaras. Im borrowing money to pay my bus fare to college. I will only be able to rent a room if I can find a job, Nitin said.        
	Didar Singh Randhawa, president of Sri Guru Singh Sabha in Southall, blamed the problems on recession and a surge in student numbers. We are happy to provide food. But the students also ask for accommodation. We provide them with shelter for a day or two. We hear some sleep on pavements, Randhawa said.        
	Nitin said he had paid an agent back home nearly 600 (Rs 48,000) to arrange for a student visa and spent another 2,480 (Rs 1.98 lakh) on college fees and flight tickets. The sum came from his parents life savings and loans from relatives.

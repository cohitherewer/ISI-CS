	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 15: Budhi, the female elephant who was reportedly injured after unidentified villagers shot at her near Khurda on Thursday, died last night.        
	The 70-year-old pachyderm was allegedly shot at for trying to damage crops.        
	However, the government had a different version. The post-mortem report says that she had not received bullet injuries. She died of multi-organ failure, pneumonia and haemorrhage of intestine, Orissa University of Agricultural Technology veterinary doctor S.K. Panda said.

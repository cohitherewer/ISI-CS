The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Taliban chill down Kashmir spine   Radio intercepts fuel infiltration fears 
                                                                                                               Taliban chill down Kashmir spine     Radio intercepts fuel infiltration fears 
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                                    
	Srinagar, April 7: Dozens of militants have apparently sneaked into Kashmir braving the heavy snow and stiff security presence, and security forces fear some of them may be from the Taliban.        
	They may include some Taliban militants. We have intercepted some radio conversations between Lashkar militants, which indicate that Taliban men are already here, a police source said.        
	A group of Lashkar militants have successfully entered through the Trehgam sector and another group of Hizb-ul Mujahideen rebels from the Gurez sector in the past few weeks.        
	Officially, however, both the police and the army have been denying any Taliban infiltration in the Valley.        
	We have no such information about their presence, Kupwara police chief Uttam Chand said today.        
	The Hurriyat also seemed to go along with the official police version, with hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani saying the Taliban and al Qaida were yet to make a foray.        
	Indian security agencies are unleashing propaganda that Taliban and al Qaida militants have sneaked into Kashmir. They are doing so because the demand for removing security forces is gaining ground and they dont want that, Geelani said.        
	Sources, however, maintained there could be an element of truth in the fear. They suspect Hizb militants could be lending the Taliban a hand.        
	The militants appeared to be sneaking in with the help of the global positioning system and other sophisticated equipment, the sources said.         
	The sources said infiltration generally began after snow started melting in late spring. This time militants started coming in when the passes were covered by a thick carpet of snow, an officer said.        
	The militant influx has apparently left the security forces a worried lot. A high-level meeting was held yesterday to discuss infiltration and gunfights in Kupwara.        
	The army today killed two militants, including the Lashkar divisional commander Abu Musa, in an encounter at the Maidanpora forests in Lolaab valley of Kupwara district.         
	The slain Lashkar commander was the topmost militant of the group in Kashmir, a police officer said.         
	Two jawans were also killed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Games put off, election excuse 
                                                                                                               Games put off, election excuse

	New Delhi/Ranchi, Oct. 15: Indias Olympic sports today seemed to receive an unwanted parity with much-envied cricket, where the domestic game is a poor cousin to international fixtures.        
	The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) put off the National Games for the fifth time in two years citing the upcoming Assembly polls in host Jharkhand. Others, however, suggested the real reason for the indefinite postponement was the need to focus exclusively on the showpiece Commonwealth Games next October, preparations for which are running behind schedule.        
	The National Games were scheduled from November 21 to December 5 while the state polls were expected in late December or early January. So, many think it unlikely that electioneering would have started during the event.        
	The National Games would have prepared the Indian contingent for the Commonwealth Games and also helped the selection process.        
	Government sources, however, said the Centre did not want to risk a heightened Maoist threat to the Games. The Congress, alive to the poor state of affairs in its Jharkhand unit, feared that any untoward incident during the event might cost it votes.        
	Besides, the postponement suited the Congress politically since the BJP had accused it of giving greater importance to the sporting event than the elections.        
	IOA chief Suresh Kalmadi asserted the only reason for the postponement was the election. Sources, however, said the government and Kalmadi were well aware of the Games proximity to the polls and that nothing new had happened recently to cause a last-minute change in plans.        
	They suggested the Centre was worried about the fate of the Commonwealth Games and the polls were an excuse.        
	National Games Organising Committee working chairman R.K. Anand said the elections couldnt have been the reason. Everybody knew the Games dates and the election has not been announced yet, he told The Telegraph. As far as we know, the state government has not asked for postponement; it has not expressed any fear of a Naxalite threat; it has not demanded additional security. We were ready to hold the Games.

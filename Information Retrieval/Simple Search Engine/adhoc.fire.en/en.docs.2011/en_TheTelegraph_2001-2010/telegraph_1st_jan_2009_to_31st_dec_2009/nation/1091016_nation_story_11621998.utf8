                                                                                                               Revealed: moon water mystery
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 15: A joint European-Indian instrument aboard the Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft has revealed fresh details of the process that creates water on the lunar surface, scientists said today.         
	The analysis of observations made by the subkilo electron volt atom reflecting analyser (Sara) has confirmed that protons from the sun are absorbed by grains of dust on the surface of the moon called lunar regolith.         
	The first signatures of lunar water were picked up by the US-made moon mineralogy mapper (M3) earlier this year.         
	Scientists who had announced the discovery last month had also suggested that incoming hydrogen nuclei  protons  from the sun may be trapped in the space between dust grains in the top layer of the lunar surface where they free trapped oxygen and produce water.         
	Now Sara readings show that not every proton is absorbed. One in every five of the incoming protons rebounds into space. We didnt expect to see this at all, said Stas Barabash, principal investigator of the Sara instrument at the Swedish Institute of Space Physics. The scientists say they cannot explain yet what is causing the reflections of the protons.         
	The protons rebound with speeds of about 200km per second and escape the moons weak gravity. Scientists believe observing patterns of these proton reflections would be a new way to examine the lunar surface.         
	The results of the Sara observations have been accepted for publication in the journal Planetary and Space Sciences. The protons from the sun are part of the solar wind, a steady stream of particles ejected by the suns surface that strikes all objects in the solar system. The earths atmosphere stops this stream from reaching the ground, but the moon has no atmospheric shield.         
	Chandrayaan-1, launched in October 2008, carried several Indian and foreign-made scientific payloads. The spacecraft experienced instrument failures earlier this year, leading to a loss of communication, prompting the Indian Space Research Organisation to end the mission in August this year.         
	Sara was built by a scientific team distributed across Sweden, India, Japan and Switzerland. The instruments principal investigator in India is Anil Bharadwaj from the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, Thiruvananthapuram.

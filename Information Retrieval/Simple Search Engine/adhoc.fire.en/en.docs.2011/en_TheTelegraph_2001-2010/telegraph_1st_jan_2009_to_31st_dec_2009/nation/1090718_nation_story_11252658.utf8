The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Shame uproar greets Singh
                                                                                                               Shame uproar greets Singh
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                           Singh with Gilani in Egypt on Thursday                                  
	New Delhi, July 17: By the time Prime Minister Manmohan Singh returned pre-dawn today from his frenetic two-nation scurry, it was already clear to most in the high-powered executive nose of Air India One that they faced another hard and wearying day ahead.         
	They all had a keen sense that what they were trying to project as a foreign policy breakthrough with Pakistan at Sharm-al-Sheikh would be met with angry cries of surrender! at home. As one member of the prime ministerial delegation remarked as we prepared to board the flight home yesterday: Beware, when we land, theyll probably be screaming sharm (shame) at Sharm-al-Sheikh. The uproar in the houses of Parliament today quickly validated all their fears.         
	The jury is out on whether the Indo-Pak joint statement will become a significant marker of improved ties, as the Prime Minister firmly believes it will, but South Block cannot escape the fact that immediately after the statement, it turned defensive on it. Worse, in trying to put a convenient spin on its implications, it tied itself up in knots that will take a while to untangle.         
	At issue was not even that unprecedented Pakistani insertion on threats to Balochistan, which has already been damned by many, including former national security adviser Brajesh Mishra, as an indirect admission of Indian guilt. At issue was this paragraph tucked in the midriff of the statement: Both Prime Ministers recognised that dialogue is the only way forward. Action on terrorism should not be linked to the Composite Dialogue process and these should not be bracketed. Prime Minister Singh said that India was ready to discuss all issues with Pakistan, including all outstanding issues.         
	To Pakistanis, and to most on the Indian side who read it straight, it was clear that, for whatever reason or intent, New Delhi had made a radical overnight shift and agreed to resume composite dialogue even though Pakistan had made tardy progress on bringing the Mumbai plotters to justice.         
	The change was flashing as breaking news on television channels almost immediately (one English news channel had, in fact, obtained the statement much ahead of its release and was running it from early morning).         
	It isnt clear whether the Prime Ministers party got instant and politically alarming feedback from home or whether they got alerted by the eruption of celebrations in the Pakistani camp, out in huge numbers at Singhs Golf Resort Hotel where the three-hour bilateral talks were held. But the Indian establishment looked immediately stuttered and shaken by the response.         
	While the Pakistanis  officials and journalists  hugged and hailed each other in the vast lobby and Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani floated out triumphantly in an eddy of flashbulbs, a senior Indian diplomat morosely conceded: I dont know whats suddenly happened, but we seem to have given too much away, in fact more than the Pakistanis seemed to want. What have we got in return?         
	But almost immediately, another section of the Prime Ministers party was putting a brave front and a fancy spin on the statement. Dont read too much into it, one of them sagely advised Indian journalists, it is actually quite open-ended and ambiguous, the way we look at it, all we have said is that Pakistan should not bring up the issue of composite dialogue each time we raise the terror issue, that is what this delinking means.         
	Another one offered what he called the argument of logic and reason  Look, talks are the only way out, not talking does not help, the nitty-gritty of statements is not important, whats important is that we have agreed to talk even as we strongly demanded guarantees against terror.But had India not linked terror and the composite dialogue in the first place? What did this agreement on delinking then mean? Had foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon not told journalists only the previous evening that there could not be talks unless Pakistan met oft-stated Indian conditionalities on terror? What prompted the abandoning of those from the text of the statement? Indeed, what brought on the insertion of Balochistan? Questions were flying in their faces thick and fast.         
	But you see theres no mention of Kashmir, one of them retorted, trying to suggest India had had its little victories too. But then what about the agreed dialogue on all issues with Pakistan, including all outstanding issues? Surely Kashmir remains on the table; and now, Balochistan too, enshrined as a Pakistani grouse on an official bilateral document. From the frantic hubbub of officials in and around the Prime Ministers suite, it was only too evident that the Indian side knew it was not convincing too many and was having to run post-haste to put a respectable picture on what it had agreed to. By the time Singh took the stage to address accompanying Indian journalists  the international media was locked out of this one  the sense of surrender, and the need to allay it, had sunk in to South Block mandarins.         
	The first question asked of him was too clearly a pre-arranged affair, for no sooner had it been asked than the Prime Minister began reading out from a long and prepared text. By the time he had finished  it was almost a suo motu clarification of the kind he delivered in Parliament today  he had, in effect, done a total turnaround on the statement he had just jointly approved with counterpart Gilani.         
	By saying unequivocally and repeatedly that India would not agree to resuming the composite dialogue unless it saw credible, effective and sustainable action against the Mumbai attack perpetrators and the terror infrastructure in Pakistan, Singh had immediately linked the two issues and virtually turned back on the agreement he had just made.         
	Now on, it is probably going to take all too many words to explain the meaning of that single and simple word called delink.

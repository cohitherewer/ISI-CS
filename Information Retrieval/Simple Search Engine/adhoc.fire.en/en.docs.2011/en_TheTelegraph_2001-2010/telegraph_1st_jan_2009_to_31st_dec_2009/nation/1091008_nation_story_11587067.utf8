                                                                                                               Subsidy on onion, potato
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, Oct. 7: The administration today began to supply onions and potatoes at reasonable rates across Cuttack as prices soared in the city.         
	The administration took the decision after retailers were seen cashing in on the shortage by charging as high as Rs 28 per kg to Rs 34 for onions. While potato prices hovered between Rs 18 and 20 since April.         
	The district has also sent out a warning to traders against black marketing.         
	Cuttack collector Kishore Kumar Mohanty said: Thirty kiosks have been set up across the city to supply onions and potatoes at reasonable rates. Here onion would be available at Rs 24 per kg. Potatoes will be available at Rs 15 per kg, he said to The Telegraph today.         
	Mohanty said the kiosks will supply a kilogram of potato and onions to consumers every day. The districts action plan will be to ensure that prices remain under check vis--vis hoarders.

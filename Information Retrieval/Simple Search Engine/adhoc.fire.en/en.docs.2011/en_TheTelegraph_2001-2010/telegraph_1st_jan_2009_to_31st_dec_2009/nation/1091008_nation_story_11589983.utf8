	New Delhi, Oct. 7: Beneath the veneer of alliance, a common manifesto and joint campaign lie the thorns of animosity and distrust between the Congress and the NCP.        
	Congress leaders now realise that the bitter bargaining for seats is nothing compared to the landmine Sharad Pawar has laid on the ground: inputs sent to the high command suggest that over 45 rebel candidates troubling the official nominees enjoy the blessings of the ally.        
	Many Congress leaders feel that the main challenge the party is facing is the possibility of internal sabotage by the Pawar camp. Most rebels who pose a real threat to Congress candidates are powerful NCP leaders.         
	The Congress leadership itself was keen to whittle down Pawars influence in the state but could not dream up such an elaborate plan to hurt the NCP candidates on the field. Congress leaders who openly talk about the need to restrict the NCP to 30-35 seats admit they dont have a statewide action plan to achieve the target.        
	A Congress leader told The Telegraph: This is true we face sabotage and we cannot match Pawarsahebs artful tactics. If both the partners play this game of undercutting each other, this becomes a dangerous game. This could also help the rivals beyond our imagination. We should keep our fingers crossed.        
	Adding to the Congress-NCP woes is the savage rise in the prices of essential commodities. This has definitely caused voter apathy, if not a strong anti-incumbency. Our sympathisers who are opposed to the Shiv Sena-BJP also dont feel like voting us back to power. It is gradually becoming difficult, another leader said on phone from Mumbai.        
	He added that the only reason the Congress-NCP combine would still be back in the saddle was the growing clout of Raj Thackerays Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS). Raj will give us raj, he said.        
	Raj has become such a menace for the Sena that both Bal Thackeray and Uddhav have concentrated their energies on tackling him. This is helping the Congress-NCP as the Sena and the BJP have not yet kicked up too much dust on the performance of the government in the past 10 years.They already had the disadvantage of not having a projected leader who could be seen as an alternative chief minister and now they dont have an engine to pull their campaign. We would have definitely faced difficulties if the campaign was focused on matters of governance, instead of Raj, a Maharashtra Congress leader said.        
	Raj has created a situation in which the Sena-BJP is struggling in most of the 75 constituencies in the Mumbai-Thane-Nashik region. Congress leaders wont be surprised if the Sena-BJP fails to win lesser seats than the MNS in this region.        
	While the hardcore Marathi votes are likely to split vertically, the Congress is hoping to squeeze past the post on the strength of consolidated votes of outsiders (mostly north Indians) and Muslims. The non-Marathi-speaking voters play a decisive role in the Mumbai-Pune-Thane region.

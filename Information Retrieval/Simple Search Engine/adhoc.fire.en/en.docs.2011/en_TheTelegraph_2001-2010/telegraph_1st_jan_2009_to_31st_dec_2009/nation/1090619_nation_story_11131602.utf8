The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Knowledge panel revamp 
                                                                                                               Knowledge panel revamp 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, June 18: The National Knowledge Commission that prepared the blueprint for massive reforms in Indias education may now be restructured to oversee the implementation of its recommendations.         
	Two months after the panels term ended on April 2, its chairman Sam Pitroda today met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and discussed a role for the panel in the UPAs second term.         
	Pitroda told The Telegraph the meet was aimed principally to discuss the need to implement the commissions recommendations, most of which were ignored by former human resource development minister Arjun Singh.        
	The Prime Minister understands and is keen to ensure that necessary reforms in education do take place. We spoke about how that can be achieved, Pitroda said.         
	But sources privy to the conversation between Pitroda and Singh revealed that the meeting saw the two discuss a future role in Indias higher education for the commission.         
	The commission may not retain its existing nomenclature, but it could be restructured into a body tasked with overseeing the implementation of education reforms that the Prime Minister is keen on, a source said.         
	The meet follows the governments first open commitment to following the panels recommendations, in the Presidents address to Parliament on June 4, after years of tussle between the panel and the HRD ministry.         
	The sources, however, added that Singh was yet to take a final decision on the future of the commission and whether it could be restructured into an authority to oversee education reforms.         
	Todays meeting, the sources said, constituted the first formal discussions on the panels future in UPA II.         
	But the Prime Minister, who conceived the idea of the NKC in 2005, is learnt to be pleased with the panels recommendations.         
	The NKC was set up on October 2, 2005, with a time bound, three year mandate to prepare blueprints to transform India into a knowledge society. But the Prime Minister last year extended its term by six months till April this year.         
	Pitrodas panel suggested abolishing existing higher education regulators like the University Grants Commission and the All India Council for Technical Education, frequently accused of corruption.         
	Instead, it suggested setting up an Independent Regulatory Authority for Higher Education (IRAGE) to regulate all streams of higher education.         
	The panels recommendations, including relaxing barriers on the entry of foreign universities in India, triggered a cold war between the NKC and the HRD ministry under Arjun.         
	A majority of the NKCs recommendations were not implemented under Arjun.         
	But new HRD minister Kapil Sibal indicated on his first day of office that he is keen to implement most recommendations of the NKC.

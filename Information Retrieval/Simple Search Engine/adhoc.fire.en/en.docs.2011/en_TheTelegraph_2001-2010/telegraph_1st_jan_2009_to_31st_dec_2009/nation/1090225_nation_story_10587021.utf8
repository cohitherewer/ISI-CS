	Hyderabad, Feb. 24: A tribal woman sold her three-day-old son yesterday to pay a government doctor who had demanded a bribe to put the baby in an incubator after delivery.        
	The Rs 6,000 sale took place in the constituency of Union minister Renuka Chowdhury, a champion of womens and childrens rights, around the time the world was toasting Slumdog Millionaires optimistic portrayal of Indias underdog children.        
	Police tonight traced and brought the child back to mother Tagarapu Rajitha, 20, and sent them both to a government shelter.        
	Rajitha, who lived in a coal-mining hamlet 200km northwest of Hyderabad, had been pregnant and penniless.        
	She had left husband Mallesh, an auto-rickshaw driver, because she found out he had another wife. Her parents would not accept her back because she had married against their wishes.        
	So Rajitha arrived alone at the government hospital in Kothagudem town, 20km from her village and located in women and child development minister Renukas Lok Sabha seat of Khammam.        
	She had a caesarean delivery on February 20. According to Rajitha, the anaesthetist demanded Rs 2,000 to put the baby in an incubator, a life-saving procedure.        
	Rajitha decided to save her son at the cost of permanent separation from him. She promised the sum and, with the help of hospital staff and an auto driver she knew, discreetly put the baby up for sale. Yesterday, a childless couple arrived, paid her Rs 6,000 and left with the infant.        
	I paid the doctor Rs 2,000 from the money, Rajitha told Khammam superintendent of police Mahesh Bhagat this morning after head nurse Sulochana blew the whistle on the sale.        
	The news will shock Renuka, who has failed to get several new laws on womens rights, drafted by her ministry, from being tabled in Parliament. The laws on sexual harassment, marriage registration, dowry and sati are stuck in the bureaucratic pipeline, and officials fear the bills may be buried if she fails to return as the minister after the elections.        
	In Andhra, baby sale is rampant in the impoverished tribal belts of Nalgonda, Mahboobnagar and Ranga Reddy, where families are afraid to bring up girls because of the dowry menace.        
	In Khammam, the police have arrested the auto driver and a woman who had brokered the sale.        
	Action is being initiated against anaesthetist Siva Sankaraiah and several hospital employees, said revenue division officer Rajaram, who heads the district administrations probe. A case will be registered against Rajitha too.        
	For now, Rajitha has resumed breast-feeding her son. She can later decide if she wants to keep him or put him up for adoption.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Congress lukewarm to first flush   Party looks hard for vision
                                                                                                               Congress lukewarm to first flush     Party looks hard for vision
          RASHEED KIDWAI                      Farooq Abdullah of the National Conference gave the swearing-in a miss and headed to South Africa to watch IPL matches after his name didn rsquo;t figure on the first list of ministers. 
  Ladakh was at the source of the strain between allies NC and Congress, sources said. An NC rebel contested as an Independent from the Congress seat and won. Ghulam Hassan Khan then returned to the NC, sparking allegations that he was a proxy candidate fielded to defeat the Congress. 
  Farooq is, however, likely to get a berth in next week rsquo;s expansion.                                
	New Delhi, May 22: Restaurant bookings got cancelled this afternoon as the first leg of cabinet formation left a sour taste in too many mouths in the Congress.        
	Many had hoped to see a dash of youth, fresh from election victory, in a Team Manmohan carrying the Prime Ministers stamp and Sonia and Rahul Gandhis vision for the future.        
	Instead, they were stunned to find that as many as seven of the 19 in Manmohan Singhs A-team were, like the Prime Minister himself, from the Rajya Sabha.        
	From the heartland to the south, the picks  or the lack of them  were equally baffling.        
	The Congress won 13 seats from Kerala, but both cabinet members from the state come from the Rajya Sabha. Two slots have gone to Karnataka where the Congress performed miserably in the Lok Sabha polls and the earlier Assembly elections.        
	The omission of Uttar Pradesh, which perhaps gave the Congress its most surprising and encouraging boost this election, went without explanation. There were many cabinet aspirants from the state, including Salman Khurshid and Beni Prasad Verma.                  
	Among the younger lot, Anand Sharma alone was elevated to cabinet rank, but he too is from the Upper House. Sharma is from Himachal Pradesh, where the Congress won one seat out of four.        
	The supporters of Khurshid, M. Mallikarjun Kharge, Kishore Chandra Dev, Jairam Ramesh, Prithviraj Chavan and some others were heard wondering why their leaders had been ignored in todays exercise.        
	Party insiders said they hoped for a fair deal in the next round of inductions early next week, but many still wondered why Sonia had not insisted on the MPs from Uttar Pradesh being represented today.        
	An All India Congress Committee official dubbed the days cabinet formation as a safe exercise but failed to explain why Singh and Sonia had to be so cautious and look to the Rajya Sabha for talent when the party had 206 Lok Sabha MPs.        
	Soon after the May 16 verdict, many party leaders considered close to the Prime Minister and the Congress chief had stressed the need for the induction of clean as well as young ministers. The word went round that Lok Sabha members would get a bigger share in key ministries.        
	The portfolios have not been allocated yet, but it appears that some key ministries  including defence and external affairs  might go to Upper House nominees.        
	The day had begun on an expectant note with a steady flow of visitors to the homes of many of the newly elected MPs who hoped to make it to the cabinet. By noon, some of these MPs households were distributing sweets although there was no official word on cabinet berths.        
	Many of the hopefuls had booked tables in restaurants for family and friends. By afternoon, many of the bookings had been cancelled and the venue for lunch shifted to the state bhavans that are known to dish out modest thali meals.        
	All eyes are now on Tuesday  the possible date of the next swearing-in, if it is not postponed to Wednesday  but the spirit of first day, first show has fizzled out. After the euphoria of a gruelling electoral battle won against heavy odds, most aspirants are now not too sure they will be figuring in the ministry.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CPI rewrites Kerala hoardings 
                                                                                                               CPI rewrites Kerala hoardings 
          JOHN MARY                         Bardhan: Central assurance                                  
	Thiruvananthapuram, March 14: CPI cadres in Kerala have begun rewriting hoardings of the LDF exclusively for their own party despite general secretary A.B. Bardhans assurance today to stay with the CPM-led ruling front.        
	The CPI, sources said, has also gone ahead with finalising candidates for 18 of the 20 seats for the Lok Sabha elections. Lists of candidates came in from four constituencies and the rest would be ready before the CPIs state executive meeting on March 16.        
	The seat-sharing squabble between the CPM and the CPI centres around the constituency of Ponnani in Keralas Malappuram district. The CPI has threatened to field candidates in all CPM constituencies in the polls if it is not allowed to contest Ponnani.        
	Yesterday, CPI state secretary Veliyam Bhargavan said: There is no going back on our demand for four seats including Ponnani. We will not surrender to the CPMs strategy of containing the partners. We are ready to face any consequences arising from our decision.        
	Asked if this meant a possibility of severing ties with the LDF, he said: What else could this mean?         
	Bardhans assurance to the CPM in Bhubaneswar came after open bickering between the partners for weeks.        
	In Ponnani, a seat the CPI has not won since 1984, the CPM has thrown its weight behind Hussein Randathani, a Muslim scholar. He has already started campaigning on his home turf though the CPM has not named him the candidate.         
	Randathani said the CPIs probable candidate, filmmaker Kamal, was welcome for a friendly contest. Kamal, an Independent like Randathani, is fighting shy of a confrontation.         
	The Peoples Democratic Party, which is allied with neither the United Democratic Front (UDF) nor the LDF, has also said it would field its man in Ponnani if the LDF did not clean up the mess. LDF allies resent Peoples Democratic Party chairman Abdul Nasser Madanis meddling in Left politics as he was an accused in the Coimbatore blasts case. Though exonerated in the case, he still has a few cases against him for making communally inflammatory speeches.         
	The rival Congress-led UDF is not sitting still in Ponnani either. It is trying to make the best use of A.P. Abdulla Kutty, an MP recently expelled from the CPM. Kutty recently spoke at an event urging voters in the Muslim-dominated constituency to ensure the victory of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), a Congress ally.         
	Former education minister E.T. Mohammed Basheer is the League candidate in Ponnani. In neighbouring Malappuram, the IUML has fielded junior external affairs minister E. Ahamed.         
	The CPM wants to have another shot at the League bastion of Malappuram and Ponnani having won in Manjeri (now Malappuram) in the 2004 elections.         
	Surveys give the Opposition UDF an edge over the LDF. In 2004, the UDF managed to win just one out of the 20 Lok Sabha seats  E. Ahamed in Ponnani.

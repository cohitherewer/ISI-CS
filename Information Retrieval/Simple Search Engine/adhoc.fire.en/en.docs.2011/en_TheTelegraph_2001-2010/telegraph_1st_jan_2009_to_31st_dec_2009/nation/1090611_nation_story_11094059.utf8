                                                                                                               Reluctant man passes flu to mom
                            
	New Delhi, Jun 10 (PTI): A swine flu-infected businessman, who refused to be hospitalised and passed on the virus to his mother, relented tonight and is now undergoing treatment at a hospital in the capital.        
	M. Lal, director of health services, Delhi, said that after much persuasion, hospital staff succeeded in shifting the 34-year-old and his mother to RML hospital from their home near Palam international airport.         
	We have quarantined all the family members of the businessman as well as the servants. Their blood samples have been sent to the National Institute of Communicable Disease for tests, Lal added.        
	The businessman carried the flu virus from New York but refused to be hospitalised and insisted on being treated at home, thereby passing on the infection to his mother.        
	Relative search        
	Health authorities scrambled today to find close contacts of a man suspected to be infected with the H1N1 virus who had attended a pre-wedding ritual in Delhi a day before he developed fever and flu symptoms.         
	The young man who had arrived from the US earlier this week was fine when he walked through airport health surveillance. The family approached health authorities after he developed fever. A test indicated he had swine flu.        
	Health officers have begun tracing the mans family members and others who might have come into close contact with him to provide them with the antiviral drug oseltamivir.

	New Delhi, Aug. 31: First to enter at 9am sharp: P. Chidambaram. The next is expected to be a long queue of officials desperate to get in on time.        
	Dont be surprised if this scene plays out at North Block tomorrow morning, thanks to a new identification-cum-time recording system that is part of the home ministers drive to ensure staff punctuality. The biometric identification system is aimed at regulating working hours in the ministry, where some employees are said to be overworked while others are always late.        
	Initial murmurs against the system died down after Chidambaram decided to set an example for the employees by becoming the first to give his fingerprints to the systems developers. When the developers of the software came late last month, Chidambaram said he would be the first to give his fingerprint. There has been no noise since then, said an official. A 10-minute delay for three successive days will mean losing a days salary.

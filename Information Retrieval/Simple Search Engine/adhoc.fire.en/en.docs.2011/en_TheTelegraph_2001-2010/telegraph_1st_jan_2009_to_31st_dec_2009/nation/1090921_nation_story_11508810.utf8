The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Painter takes state to court
                                                                                                               Painter takes state to court
          OUR CORRESPONDENT      
	Cuttack, Sept. 20: State-owned Orissa Lalit Kala Akademi is embroiled in a controversy again, with the state culture department deciding to withdraw painter Sarat Kumar Rath from the office of vice-president before the expiry of his term.        
	Following the decision, the government, under flak for its ad hoc approach towards apex cultural bodies, stands accused of arbitrary and unreasonable attitude. Filing a petition in Orissa High Court, Rath challenged the decision as contrary to the terms and conditions of the Akademi.        
	On August 29, 2007, the culture department after a gap of six years reconstituted a general council of Orissa Lalit Kala Akademi with Jagadish Chandra Kanungo and Chandramani Biswal as the re-elected president and secretary, respectively.        
	The 25-member council with a three-year tenure had members such as Sarat Kumar Rath as vice-president, with painters Jatin Das, Durga Prasad Das, Shyam Sundar Patnaik, Ramhari Jena and Nikunja Behari Das and sculptor Sudarsan Sahoo and Sudarsan Patnaik as members.        
	Jagadish Chandra Kanungo retired as the president 16 months ago and Chandramani Biswal completed his term in June. Then the culture department issued a notification withdrawing Sarat Kumar Rath, who was then officiating as president under Aricle 5 (b) of the Akademi constitution, from the vice-presidents chair on September 1, 2009.        
	Article 9(ii) of the Constitution makes it clear that each member of the general council, excluding official members, shall hold office for a term of three years and shall be eligible for reappointment. The vice-president is a member of the Akademi and there is no provision in the Constitution to terminate or withdraw a duly appointed vice president before the expiry of the term, said the painter.

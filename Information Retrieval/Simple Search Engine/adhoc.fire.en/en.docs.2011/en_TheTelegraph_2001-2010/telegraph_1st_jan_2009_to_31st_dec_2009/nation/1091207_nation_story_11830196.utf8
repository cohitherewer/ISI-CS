          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Dec. 6: The Centre has left the decision of a CBI probe into the alleged multi-crore mining scam to the high court.        
	The Centres stand was communicated in a preliminary counter affidavit in the high court, which is hearing as many as four PILs seeking an inquiry by the CBI into the alleged scam.        
	By deciding against taking a position on the issue, the Union government has effectively decided not to oppose the Orissa governments decision that expressed trust in professional competence of the state vigilance to handle the case and has put the ball in the high courts court.        
	However, the Centre has expressed willingness to offer all necessary assistance in the matter. Tapan Kumar Rath, the deputy controller of mines (Indian Bureau of Mines) filed the affidavit on Friday on behalf of the Centre.

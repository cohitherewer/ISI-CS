          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, Dec. 14: The BJP will sell brand Raman again in the coming civic body elections in Chhattisgarh.        
	The party has been using the same brand in the Lok Sabha elections held this year and last years Assembly polls in which it retained power.        
	Since the brand has clicked among the masses, the party has decided to push the chief minister, Raman Singh, as its star campaigner even in the civic body elections in the state, a senior state BJP office-bearer said.        
	Singh today started his campaign trail from the northern region. Even in austerity and low-profiled civic body polls, the BJP has hired three choppers for the chief minister to cover the length and breadth of the state.        
	The party has also prepared a chariot in which Singh will perform the road shows, the party leader said.         
	The civic body elections in the state will be held in two phases later this month.        
	The ambitious scheme of the state government to provide a kilogram of rice to below poverty line people for just Rs 2 has projected Singh as a mass leader of the poor.        
	But the regular projection of the same brand sometimes backfire, said political observer Virendra Pandey.         
	This could be the reason why Brand Raman did not deliver in the recently concluded by-election in Vaishali Nagar constituency.         
	Sources said that following the partys humiliating defeat in Vaishali Nagar, the civic body elections in the state had become crucial for the party and the chief minister. This is the reason why Singh has put Brand Raman at the fore, Pandey added.

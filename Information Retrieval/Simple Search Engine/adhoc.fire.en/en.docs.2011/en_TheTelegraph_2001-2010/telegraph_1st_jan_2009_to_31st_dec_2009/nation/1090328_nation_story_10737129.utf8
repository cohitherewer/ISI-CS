	 Hyderabad: Not that he loves fans less, but he loves the Lord more.          
	Chiranjeevi will contest the April 23 Assembly polls from Tirupati, home to the Balaji temple and the town where he had launched his Praja Rajyam party in August.          
	The announcement disappointed some of his fans in Telengana and Rayalaseema who had expected the actor to represent their region in the Assembly.          
	Chiranjeevi, pitching his party as an alternative to the Telugu Desam and the Congress, has come out with his first list of 95 candidates for the Assembly and nine for the Lok Sabha. The state has 294 MLAs and 42 MPs.          other batch of contestants will be announced soon. Chiranjeevi is already on the campaign trail and has been holding meetings and rallies in East Godavari.                  
	 Mumbai: Ticket denied, dash to rivals door.          
	Pramod Mahajans daughter Poonam met Raj Thackeray on Friday, fuelling speculation that she could contest the Lok Sabha polls as a candidate of his Maharashtra Navnirman Sena.           
	The meeting comes three days after the BJP, her late fathers party, denied her a ticket. Poonam, a general secretary of the BJP youth wing Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, denied there was anything political in the talks at Rajs Dadar home.           
	Raj Thackeray has been a family friend (since his Shiv Sena days) and I went to give him Gudhi Padwa (Maharashtrian new year) wishes, she said.           am had been eyeing the Mumbai North East seat, which used to be represented by her father.           cle and BJP general secretary Gopinath Munde is said to have lobbied hard for her with the top brass but failed. Kirit Somaiya, who had won the seat once, has been named the candidate.                  
	 Hyderabad: The Telugu Desams poll star is under a cloud of uncertainty.          
	NTR Junior, the grandson of the late party founder NTR, was admitted to hospital here on Thursday after his car met with an accident on the way back from a poll rally.          
	The mishap has upset the plans of the Desam, which had been banking on the 26-year-old lookalike of his grandfather to work his charm on voters and wean them off the Congress. His campaign histrionics were a hit with crowds.

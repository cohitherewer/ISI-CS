The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong to ease minister load
                                                                                                               Cong to ease minister load
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, July 12: Forget party duty, focus on ministry.        
	Sonia Gandhi seems to have decided that Congress ministers should focus single-mindedly on their departments and try and meet the 100-day deadline on policy initiatives instead of getting distracted by organisational work.        
	So Pranab Mukherjee, A.K. Antony, M. Veerappa Moily and Ghulam Nabi Azad are among the Union ministers expected to shed party responsibilities when the Congress chief shuffles her team of office-bearers shortly, sources said.        
	The shuffle, which has assumed the air of expectancy of a major cabinet expansion, is likely to be done before the party holds its first self-congratulatory session after the Lok Sabha elections.        
	The one-day meeting is most likely to take place in Mumbai and, in a sense, will kick off the campaign for the Maharashtra elections due in October.        
	Political expediency apart, the event might be symbolic because the dates the party is looking at are either August 9, the day the Quit India bugle was sounded from Mumbais Gowalia Tank, or on Rajiv Gandhis birth anniversary on August 20.        
	After a debate on whether the Congress should adopt the one-person-one-post norm the BJP scrupulously follows, it seems Sonia has decided that her party ministers should focus single-mindedly on their government mandate.        
	At least one senior minister, Azad, who looks after health and family welfare, has been spending equal time on the states he was assigned as a Congress general secretary and his home turf Jammu and Kashmir.        
	While Mukherjee doesnt hold a position in the central party apparatus, he continues to head the Bengal Congress. A problem for Sonia is finding a replacement for Mukherjee.        
	Obviously, it will have to be a person who will have a working relationship with Mamata Banerjee without undermining the Congresss identity, a source said.

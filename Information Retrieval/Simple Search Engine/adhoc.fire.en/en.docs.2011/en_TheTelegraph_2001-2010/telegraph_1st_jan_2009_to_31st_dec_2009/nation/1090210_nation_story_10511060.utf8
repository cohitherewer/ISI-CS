The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Amar rails at Cong before case
                                                                                                               Amar rails at Cong before case
          OUR BUREAU AND PTI                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 9: Congress-Samajwadi Party ties have hit a low ahead of tomorrows hearing of a CBI assets case against Mulayam Singh Yadav.        
	Amar Singh today accused the Congress of using the CBI as a sword against his party chief to put him under pressure during the ongoing seat-sharing talks.        
	We supported the Congress-led government (in the July 2008 trust vote), which has crossed all limits to fix its opponents, the Samajwadi general secretary said. Had the Samajwadis guessed how things would turn out, they would never have supported the Congress, he added.        
	Amar alleged that the CBI had registered the case without verifying the allegations made against Mulayam. If I claim the Taj Mahal belongs to Manmohan Singh and India Gate belongs to Rahul Gandhi, will a disproportionate assets case be registered?         
	Amar threw a challenge to the Congress, CBI and Sonia Gandhi saying if the charges against Mulayam were true, so were allegations against some Congress leaders.        
	Congress-Samajwadi relations have come under strain since seat talks began. The Congress wants to improve its performance in Uttar Pradesh by contesting from more constituencies but the Samajwadis dont want to give it more than 15 seats.        
	Amar said: The Left parties were good when (they were) supporting (the UPA). When they withdrew support, there was a case against (CPM leader) Pinarayi Vijayan in Kerala.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Silk sale, varsity haunt voters
                                                                                                               Silk sale, varsity haunt voters
          GAUTAM SARKAR                              
	Bhagalpur, April 28: Failure to revive the thriving silk trade in this city has come back to haunt political parties this election.        
	Claims about development achieved by political parties here has failed to impress many voters. Many cited government indifference to the excavated Vikramshila World University and revival of the silk industry to explain their disillusionment. The silk industry was destroyed during the 1989 Bhagalpur communal riots.         
	The Nitish-led government had, for the first time, tried to provide justice to riot victims. But, he still failed to restore the sinking silk industry, alleged Md Kaishal, a riot affected weaver of Toumani village in Bhagalpur. This time we will choose a local candidate like Ajit Sharma, a BSP candidate, who will understand our needs unlike outsiders, said Vivekanand Singh of Kahalgaon.         
	Bhagalpur resident Rajesh Kumar agreed with him. We will not vote for Congress candidate Sadanand Singh, who had not done much for us even when he was the Speaker during Lalus regime. We are hoping Ajit Sharma will be more sensitive to our problems.         
	Ajit told The Telegraph that reviving the lost glory of Bhagalpur was of prime importance to him. First, we will try to revive the dying silk trade. We will also try to place Vikramshila World University back on the global map.        
	In 2008, a three-day long Vikramsila Mahotsav was held at the excavated site of the ancient university at Antichak near Kahalgaon sub-division. But no specific assurance about possible development of the varsity on the lines of Nalanda University and of the area into a tourist spot was mentioned.         
	Not a single politician has shown any interest in the site, alleged Pawan Kumar Choudhury, an expert researching on Vikramshila.

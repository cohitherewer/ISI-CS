          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 14: Seventy-five Opposition MPs from the Rajya Sabha today submitted a notice to start impeachment proceedings against Karnataka High Court Chief Justice P.D. Dinakaran over land-grabbing allegations.        
	Members of the BJP, the Left parties, Samajwadi Party, Janata Dal (United), Akali Dal and the ADMK submitted the petition to Rajya Sabha chairman and Vice-President Hamid Ansari. The Congress didnt join the move, with law minister Veerappa Moily saying in the House that the government would not like to discuss matters related to higher judiciary.        
	The petition accused Dinakaran of acts of misbehaviour and lists 12 charges, including possessing wealth disproportionate to known sources of income and illegal encroachment. The judge abused his office to secure properties for his family in Chennai, the petition said. It also accused him of having made arbitrary and illegal appointments and transfers.        
	Although the Congress stayed out of the move, Moily tried to remove the impression that the party was soft on cor ruption in the judiciary.        
	After any person becomes a judge, I dont think he can afford to commit any act of commission or omission. It can be addressed at any point of time. That is why I had thought of bringing a bill in this session. Maybe, I will be able to bring it in the last days of the session once it is approved by the cabinet. That will meet many of the questions of accountability with regard to the functioning of the judiciary, Moily said. He was answering a question on whether the government planned to constitute a National Judicial Commission.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Court sets scam probe deadline
                                                                                                               Court sets scam probe deadline
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Aug. 17: Orissa High Court today fixed a nine-day deadline for the Centre to show cause why the CBI should not be asked to investigate an alleged Rs 25-lakh crore derivative scam.        
	The case involved the huge losses apparently suffered by Indian business houses on account of exchange derivative contracts that they entered into a couple of years ago to circumvent their foreign exchange risks.        
	The high court had decided to consider the necessity of a CBI probe on the scam after a writ petition was filed alleging the scam and seeking a direction for it. One Prabanjan Patra, a city resident, had filed the petition.        
	Corporate houses were forced to deal with lower rates when dollar rose substantially, because of derivative agreements. They were, for instance, paid Rs 40 as per their derivative agreement when they were supposed to get Rs 50 against a dollar for the price of goods exported. The dealers were taking the differential Rs 10. However, dealers said that they got only 10 paise per dollar, the petition pointed out.        
	Forex derivative contracts worth $3 trillion were traded in India as of December 2007, while the total foreign exposure of India was not more than $500 billion annually. The petition alleged that the total scam was of around Rs 25 lakh crore.                           
	The case was listed before a division bench today, but it could not be taken up for hearing as the replies had not been received from the respondents. The bench of acting Chief Justice I.M. Quddusi and Justice Sanju Panda adjourned hearing on the case to August 26 after assistant solicitor-general J.K. Mishra sought more time on behalf of the central government to file the replies, the petitioners counsel Manoj Kumar Mishra said.

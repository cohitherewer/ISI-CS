The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Dear voter...   WHY YOU SHOULD VOTE for the hand
                                                                                                               DEAR VOTER...     - Its election day today					 					      In case the principal opponents have not got across their message to you, Sujan Dutta goes lip-reading and comes up with a translation shorn of the political jargon      
	Why you should vote for the hand  
	Whoever said the wearer knows where the shoe pinches was wrong. We know better. Even if it wasnt our shoe.   
	Manmohan Singhji is asking for votes from the aam aadmi. And suddenly a story that is 25 years old and a shoe that belongs to someone from his own community flies in our face. So what? The BJP had better come up with answers of its own.        
	What does it have to show on Gujarat? Who has Narendra Modis government convicted for the pogrom of 2002? His cabinet colleague Maya Kodanani has just been indicted for her participation in the riots. Now that Jagdish Tytler and Sajjan Kumar have been withdrawn from the electoral race we can focus on our core issue: the aam aadmi.        
	And so much that Manmohan Singhji has done for him. The National Rural Employment Guarantee Act for example. The Left is falsely claiming credit for it. But our economist Prime Minister has seen it through.        
	Advaniji calls him a wimp, a weak man. But look at how he has pushed the civilian nuclear deal through in the teeth of opposition from the Left, defying their opposition even though they were in the coalition. He declared Indias undying love for George W. Bush who in return reciprocated with the promise of making us a superpower. We are on the road to becoming one.        
	It is another matter that a pair of shoes was aimed at Bush, too. (And now Obama is hyphenating us with Pakistan again.)        
	As we go into the elections, the aam aadmi can thank Soniajis patronage of our government for keeping peace despite serial bombings and successive terror attacks. We have not allowed these to snowball into communal riots. We believe in an inclusive society.        
	With deft diplomacy we have brought international pressure to bear on Pakistan. Pakistan is now condemned internationally as a pariah state. Unlike the BJP-led NDA we did not have to mobilise troops and deploy them on the border for a whole year after the Parliament attack.        
	Our government promises to be a mix of youth and experience. Our youthful leaders  Rahul and Priyanka  contrasts so sharply with the BJPs Varun. We are crafting a future for the country on the strong foundations laid by the Nehru-Gandhi family.        
	Even in Bengal today, the Left that supported us in the Centre is tottering. Our alliance with Mamata is translating into a mahajot that has the CPM trembling. We are present in every part of the country from Kashmir to Kerala and from Gujarat to Manipur. The BJP is hardly a force in Bengal, for instance. We are truly national.        
	We are heading into this election with a clear leader  Manmohan Singhji as Prime Minister and, no doubt, into the next with Rahul Gandhi. Expect him to join the Union cabinet this time. And the line of succession is clear. This is not about dynasty. This is about continuity and change.        
	Vote for the Hand, vote Congress.              
	Why you should vote for the lotus  
	I ask, which leader is it today who has the vision, the will power, and yes, the backbone to best protect us?   
	The clear answer to that question is Lal Krishna Advani. Determined leader, decisive government. It is with this slogan that the BJP is seeking your vote.   
	There are some crazy men who would kill us if they could.   
	But where is the national unity in this country when we need it most? The Congress under Sonia Gandhi and her puppet Manmohan Singh has ruined it.   
	Now, while young Indians are dying mdash; killed by Pakistan-sponsored terrorists in Delhis Connaught Place and Mumbais Gateway of India, in Guwahatis Panbazar and Bangalores Indian Institute of Science and in Srinagars Lal Chowk, while our nation is being torn apart and made weaker because of the communists manic obsession to bring down our countrys image mdash; what is happening to the nation that our leader Advaniji has spent his entire life working for?   
	But we are still blessed because of our youths who have seen the truth and who dare to dream. Youths like Varun Gandhi who swear that they will cut off the hands of those who dare to threaten our nation.   
	I can remember that there was a time when the Congress believed in an India that would be free and independent. But today our countrys economy lies in tatters.  
	Inflation was at its highest under Manmohan Singh when he was obsessed with the civilian nuclear deal. Yes, we initiated it under Vajpayeeji but we would have got a much better deal.   
	We would have strengthened the military. In our manifesto we have promised one rank, one pension. Under the Congress, the military has been undermined. Our determined leader Advaniji has the strength to make the military all powerful.   
	Time after time in our history, in the face of great danger, Advaniji has worked to ensure that our freedom would not falter. Today the Congress is motivated more by partisan politics than by national security. This has emboldened our enemies.   
	How dare Pakistan, a country at war with itself, send terrorists to Mumbai and watch our financial capital burn. And what do we do in turn? Nothing. We expect the Americans to fight our war for us.  
	Tell that to the hundreds of innocent people that the terrorists have killed, to the mothers and sisters who have lost their sons and brothers.   
	Running a country is not a job for the fainthearted. This government claims that it has achieved through diplomacy what was not achievable with sterner measures. What has it won? Has Pakistan taken any action against the terrorists? Such self-indulgence will put at risk all we care about in this world.  
	In this hour of danger, our leader has the courage to stand up. And I am proud to stand up with him.   
	Vote for the Lotus. Vote BJP.

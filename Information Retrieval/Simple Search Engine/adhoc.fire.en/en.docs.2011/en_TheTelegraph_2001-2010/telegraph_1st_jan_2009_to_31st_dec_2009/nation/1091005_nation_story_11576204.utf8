The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ministry mulls quota gamble
                                                                                                               Ministry mulls quota gamble
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 4: The human resource development ministry plans to impose controversial quotas on minority-run schools under the right to education law despite opposition from within and outside the government  even at the risk of facing legal embarrassment.        
	The HRD ministry is unwilling to exempt minority schools from quotas for the disadvantaged, even though sections within the government have argued that the reservations may prove violative of the law, top ministry sources said on Thursday.        
	If the courts strike the clause down, we shall see. But there is no reason why a minority institution should not fulfil its social obligations, a senior official said.        
	Christian educational institutions in Bengal protested the 25 per cent quotas for disadvantaged students after The Telegraph reported on December 13, 2008, that minority schools would not be exempt from the reservations. Each state has the power to list communities it believes are disadvantaged.        
	Hyderabad MP Asauddin Owaisi contested the quotas in the Lok Sabha during the Parliament debate preceding the passing of the law.        
	Late last month, the governments own minority education watchdog called attempts to impose the quotas and other provisions of the law on minority schools unconstitutional.        
	As reported first by this newspaper on September 17, the National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions (NCMEI) is set to oppose the HRD ministry if it is approached by minority schools forced to implement the quotas.        
	Such a scenario would prove embarrassing for the government as the NCMEI was set up by the HRD ministry under Arjun Singh to safeguard educational rights guaranteed to minorities under the Constitution.        
	Article 30 of the Constitution states that minorities are free to set up and manage educational institutions without government interference except to maintain quality and prevent mismanagement.        
	Many minority groups and the NCMEI have argued that imposing the quotas would be violative of Article 30.        
	The ministry is, however, amending another clause in the right to education law, mandating that parents of students comprise 75 per cent of the school management committee monitoring the implementation of the law.        
	The NCMEI rules define a minority institution as one where more than 50 per cent of the management members belong to the particular minority community.         
	As students at many missionary and other minority schools belong to all religions, forming the school management committee according to the right to education law could mean giving up minority status, the NCMEI has argued.              
	The HRD ministry, sources said, would amend the right to education law to exempt minority schools from the 75 per cent stipulation.

          MUZAFFAR RAINA                              
	Srinagar, Dec. 11: Union home secretary G.K. Pillai today landed the government in the soup by claiming Hyderabad would always be the capital of the proposed Telangana state.        
	I think Hyderabad will always remain the capital of Telangana, Pillai, who was in Jammu, said in an impromptu reply to a specific query over what the future of Hyderabad could be.         
	The remark, coming in the wake of a huge counter-tide against the Centres hasty decision to set the statehood ball rolling, had the potential to undo any damage-control the government was attempting.        
	North Block, the headquarters of the home ministry, swung into action soon after with a clarification that Pillai did not state Hyderabad would be the capital of Telangana.        
	In response to a question from a journalist that the proponents for the state of Telangana had wanted Hyderabad to be its capital, the home secretary had stated that this was what they wanted, a home ministry spokesperson said in a statement issued in New Delhi.         
	The issue of the capital for the proposed new state of Telangana for which steps have been initiated is a matter that is to be decided by consensus and by the government, the statement added.        
	Pillai had said the process of formation of Telangana would continue, again a thorny issue with no less than Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today iterating that nothing would be done in haste.        
	I am sure in the coming days, as the people understand the implications, the agitation will die down. The process of forming a new state will continue, the home secretary said.        
	The statement left Andhra leaders fuming. This is nothing but adding fuel to fire, Andhra minister Pitani Satyanarayana said. This is a very sensitive issue. Making such comments when already there is a lot of unrest in different regions is totally unwarranted and unbecoming of a senior IAS officer, said another minister, K. Parthasarathi.         
	We go by what the Prime Minister and Sonia Gandhi say, not what a home secretary or a clerk says, fumed Congress MP K.S. Rao.        
	Border visit        
	Pillai, who is on a two-day visit and review the Prime Ministers reconstruction package, will tour the border region of Jammu tomorrow to take stock of the situation following a spurt in infiltration attempts.         
	Infiltration continues and we have always said there has been no change in the attitude of Pakistan in infiltrating terrorists. We are strengthening (security) measures on the border, he said.        
	Pillais visit came as massive protests rocked Srinagar on Friday.         
	People clashed with police in the Maisuma area where a youth was injured. Police used tear gas shells to disperse the procession led by Hurriyat hawk Syed Ali Shah Geelani in the old city and more than two dozen people were injured.

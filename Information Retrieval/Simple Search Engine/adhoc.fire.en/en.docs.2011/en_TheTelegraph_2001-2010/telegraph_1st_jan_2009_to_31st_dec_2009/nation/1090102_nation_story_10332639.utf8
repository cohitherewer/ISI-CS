The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Banned Dawa reborn: Delhi 
                                                                                                               Banned Dawa reborn: Delhi 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 1: Lashkar-e-Toiba front Jamaat-ud-Dawa is still active under a different name weeks after the Pakistan government claimed to have banned it, India alleged today.        
	Foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon told All India Radio that Dawa had launched a new website to collect terror funds.        
	A PTI report said that Dawa had changed its name to Tehreek-e-Hurmat-e-Rasool (Movement for Defending the Honour of the Prophet). It added that senior Dawa members had recently been spotted at a rally organised in the name of the new outfit.        
	Islamabad had announced the ban on December 11 after a UN panel put Dawa on its terror list. Terror groups, however, are known to rename themselves to get around bans  a game that Islamabad winks at, according to Indian officials.        
	The name Jamaat-ud-Dawa itself was an alias that Lashkar had assumed after being outlawed in Pakistan seven years ago, when the US blacklisted it following the attack on Indias Parliament.        
	A PTI report from Delhi quoted unnamed sources as saying the headquarters of Dawa/Lashkar in Muridke near Lahore continued to function.        
	Lashkar co-founder and Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed, supposedly under house arrest, is moving freely about although in a restricted manner to escape the media glare, the sources said. They added that Islamabad had not banned Dawa magazines and other literature.        
	India alleges that Islamabads bans are token gestures and that Pakistan hasnt sincerely tried to crack down on suspects in the Mumbai carnage.        
	Menons accusation comes a day after the Wall Street Journal reported that at least one top Lashkar commander, Zarar Shah, had confessed to Pakistani interrogators that the group was involved in the Mumbai attacks.        
	Yesterday, US President George Bush had called up Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari, and all three had agreed to avoid any action that could raise tensions in the region, reports said.        
	President Bush urged both... to co-operate with each other in the Mumbai attack investigation as well as on counter-terrorism in general, White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said.        
	Bush spoke from his ranch in Crawford, Texas. In Islamabad, the presidency said in a brief statement that Zardari had reaffirmed his pledge not to allow Pakistani territory to be used by non-state actors to launch attacks in other countries.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Raje to be replaced after bypolls 
                                                                                                               Raje to be replaced after bypolls 
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 24: The BJP is unlikely to call a meeting of its Rajasthan legislators to elect a leader in place of Vasundhara Raje in a hurry.         
	It wants to be over and do-ne with the two Assembly bypolls in the state on November 7 before setting in motion the next chain of events leading to a change of guard in the Rajasthan unit after Vasundhara finally resigned on Friday.        
	Sources said they had reasons to suspect that if a legislature party meeting was convened next week, the former chief minister, who was palpably upset with the reasons and circumstances that preceded her resignation and put it in so many words in a letter she wrote to L.K. Advani, might ask for a show of strength to prove her support and even force a contest.         
	Vasundharas backers said she had 58 of the 78 MLAs on her side. The claim was not entirely refuted by a source close to BJP chief Rajnath Singh. If not 58, at least a little over half the MLAs are on her side.        
	Who knows what she may do if a meeting is called immediately? She could give an emotive speech and try and garner support. That would be a major embarrassment and another slap on the already bruised face of the BJP leadership. Besides, it will finish off whatever chance we have in the bypolls, the source said.        
	Sources maintained that a cooling-off period might take the heat off the episode of Vasundharas departure and force a rethink in her loyalists on whether it was worth their while to keep rooting for her or look for another patron.         
	This will give time to our state president (Arun Chaturvedi) and the deputy leader of the legislature party (Ghanshyam Tewari) to recraft their strategy and try and neutralise Vasundharas loyalists and the fence-sitters, they said.        
	Although the mood in the meeting of the parliamentary board on Friday was against rehabilitating Vasundhara in the near future, 24 hours later, some felt it was counterproductive to marginalise her as she was the only recognisable face the BJP had in Rajasthan.

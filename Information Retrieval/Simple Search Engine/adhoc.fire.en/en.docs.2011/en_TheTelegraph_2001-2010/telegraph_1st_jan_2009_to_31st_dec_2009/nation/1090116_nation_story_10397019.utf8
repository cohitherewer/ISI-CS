The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Naxalbari rivals team up for Bihar elections
                                                                                                               Naxalbari rivals team up for Bihar elections
          JAYANTH JACOB                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 15: The CPM and the CPI(ML) have put their bitter past behind them to come together in Bihar for the general election.        
	The alliance, which includes the CPI, is limited to Bihar but it marks a change in stand for the CPM, which has never accepted the CPI(ML) as a credible Left party.        
	Differences between the two parties, visible in Nandigram recently, go back to the Naxalbari peasant uprising in 1967. The CPI(ML) says it was formed after the uprising was brutally suppressed by the CPM-led United Front government of West Bengal at the behest of the Congress government at the Centre.         
	The CPI(ML) also accuses the CPM of attacking a 1969 rally, to be addressed by Kanu Sanyal, to formally launch the party in Calcutta. This, it says, marked the beginning of a whole series of CPM-inspired attacks on CPI(ML) ranks, taking an eventual toll of more than a thousand of our comrades.         
	Jalaluddin Ansari, convener of the Left co-ordination committee and a former MP of the CPI, said: We have decided on the preliminary seat sharing modalities for the parliamentary elections. But the Left unity move will not compromise their individual party lines.         
	CPI(ML) spokesperson Kavita Krishnan echoes him: It is a positive development as the CPM has responded to our appeal this time. But there were differences between us and there will be (differences).         
	The Left parties are planning to contest 20 of the 40 Lok Sabha seats, with the CPI(ML) fighting from at least 9 to 10 seats, sources said.         
	The CPM has one MLA in Bihar, Ramdev Verma from Bibhutipur in Samastipur.        
	Verma said the alliance was a move aimed at Left unity and the state secretaries of the three parties would sit together and discuss seat sharing.         
	The Left parties claim they have a presence in Purnea, Begusarai, Shahabad, Patna, Munger and Kosi.         
	Although none of the parties has a Lok Sabha MP, the CPI(ML) holds five Assembly seats, followed by the CPI with three and the CPM with one.        
	The CPI(ML) is strong in Shahabad (Ara), Siwan, some parts of Patna and Katihar. The CPM has a presence in the Kosi region.

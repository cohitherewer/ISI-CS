The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pranab slaps tax on law firms with salute to predecessor
                                                                                                               Pranab slaps tax on law firms with salute to predecessor
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                          The Supreme Court                                  
	New Delhi, July 6: One lawyer finance minister had avoided taxing them but, to the legal fraternitys chagrin, another lawyer finance minister today slapped a 12.5 per cent service tax on law firms.        
	Pranab Mukherjees budget proposal has dismayed lawyers and law firms, who say it will hit at the root of the constitutional right to legal representation and raise litigation costs.        
	The government should not treat legal services as business. It is needed by every litigant, said P.H. Parekh, the president of the Confederation of Indian Bar and former Supreme Court bar association chief.        
	He said a representation would soon be handed to the government to withdraw the tax.        
	The service tax applies only to advice, consultancy or technical assistance. It will not apply if the service provider or service receiver is an individual.        
	Parekh and Sajid Mohamed of the Mumbai-based corporate firm PDS Associates said the government could not discriminate between individuals and firms on this count. A firm is, after all, an association of individuals, Parekh said.        
	Mohamed said: How will you distinguish between individual lawyers and firms? Lawyers can work together in a loose partnership and bill separately.        
	He added that smaller law firms might dismantle themselves to avoid paying the tax.        
	Mukherjee had told Parliament: Services provided by chartered accountants, cost accountants and company secretaries as well as by engineering and management consultants are presently charged to service tax. Although there is a school of thought that legal consultants do not provide any service to the client, I hold my distinguished predecessor in high esteem and disagree.        
	This was a reference to previous finance minister P. Chidambarams decision to keep lawyers out of the service tax dragnet. Mukherjee is an inactive member of the bar in contrast to Chidambaram, who appeared frequently in court.        
	Individual lawyers now pay income tax at 10.3 per cent of their earnings if these are less than Rs 10 lakh a year, and at 11.3 per cent if they earn more. This is deducted at source every time a fee is paid by cheque.        
	Lawyer Ankur Chawla, known for his high-stakes corporate cases, said the service tax would make legal fees steeper. Law firms will pass it on to the corporate clients.        
	Chawla also said the tax would increase the role of black money in the sector. It will be reason enough for clients to try to hide their legal fees by paying law firms in cash.        
	Lawyer P.K. Bhasin, who runs Bhasin and Co and is president of the Society of Indian Law Firms, said the timing (of the tax) is bad.        
	The legal sector is going through a period of growth. Instead of announcing incentives, the government has decided to impose a tax, he said.        
	There are only 8,200 good law firms in the country, Bhasin said. These face an impending threat from foreign firms. Instead of creating a level playing field for them, the government has announced a tax.        
	He said the government would not earn much from the tax. As chairman of the Services Export Council, I will challenge the levy. First administratively legally will only be the last resort.        
	Bhasin suggested that law firms might only have to bear the tax for a year. The tax comes into force as soon as the finance bill is passed, tentatively on August 1.

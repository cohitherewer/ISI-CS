The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | ATM card gives away killer gang
                                                                                                               ATM card gives away killer gang
  - Police crow about cracking twin murders, spotlight on how dangerous Delhi is for women working late        ANANYA SENGUPTA                          Three of the accused after their arrest. Picture by Prem Singh                                        
	New Delhi, March 24: The murders have apparently been cracked, one in less than a week. But with it has come a scary confirmation  the countrys capital is unsafe for its working women.        
	Delhi police today claimed to have solved the murders of IT executive Jigisha Ghosh and television journalist Soumya Vishwanathan with the arrest of four young men, who put the cops on their trail by using the credit card of one of their victims.        
	Four persons have been arrested in connection with both the murders. One is still absconding, police commissioner Y.S. Dadwal said.        
	But the killings have raised questions about how safe women are in the capital, especially those who work late into the night.        
	Soumya, 25, was found shot dead in her car around 3.30 in the morning on September 30 last year. She was returning from work and was minutes away from her home.        
	Jigisha, 28, was abducted 50 metres from her home around 4 in the morning on March 18 and later strangled. Her body was found on a lonely stretch in Faridabad two days later.        
	Both the incidents took place near Vasant Kunj, one of Delhis most high-profile areas. And both were killed on the same stretch that has two police stations within a 2km radius.        
	The attacks were not isolated incidents. On February 19, two bikers tried to drag two women media employees out of a cab at gunpoint. In May 2006, police arrested the driver of a Noida-based call centre for the gang rape of an employee. Months later, another call-centre driver and his accomplice were arrested for trying to molest two journalists.        
	Police sources today said the four killers  Ravi Kapoor, the gang leader, Baljeet Malik, a Class XII student, Amit Kumar Shukla, a graduate, and Ajay Kumar  were returning from a party when Soumyas car passed them.        
	They asked her to stop. She panicked and tried to flee. One of them, Ravi Kapoor, a Class X dropout involved in at least 12 cases, shot her with his country-made revolver, killing her on the spot, said a source.        
	They were drunk and must have got angry when she didnt listen to them and shot her. They would have robbed her, but perhaps panicked, said DCP (South), G.H.S. Dhaliwal.        
	But the cops might not have cracked Soumyas murder had the gang not killed Jigisha, too.                
	The IT executive was returning home when the gang spotted her. One of them approached her for direction, then forced her to reveal her ATM pin code at gunpoint.        
	The four  in a stolen vehicle with a fake car sticker of Punjab-Haryana High Court that gave them permission to use tinted windows and also get past police pickets  withdrew Rs 20,000 from Jigishas account and bought goods worth Rs 70,000 using her credit card before killing her.        
	They bought shoes and clothes from a Reebok showroom, a 21-inch TV, music CDs and an expensive Timex watch with the money, part of which she had been saving to donate to a charity, said her father, Jagannath Ghosh.        
	But their shopping spree gave them away as their faces had been recorded on closed-circuit cameras.        
	Although the police claimed they had a watertight case against the quartet, police commissioner Dadwal had a tough time with reporters after he said Jigishas killing culminated in the cracking of Soumyas murder as there were no leads to pursue the six-month-old blind case.        
	When the reporters repeatedly asked if Soumyas murder would have remained unsolved had Jigisha not been killed, a frustrated Dadwal said: Criminals not leaving any clue is not our fault.        
	Asked if the gap of six months could affect the result of forensic tests on the pistol used to kill Soumya, DCP (South) Dhaliwal said markings on the gun did not change with the passage of time.        
	We have also tallied the sequence, their travels after the murder. Their description of Soumyas body also matched the description by four persons who first saw the body, he said.

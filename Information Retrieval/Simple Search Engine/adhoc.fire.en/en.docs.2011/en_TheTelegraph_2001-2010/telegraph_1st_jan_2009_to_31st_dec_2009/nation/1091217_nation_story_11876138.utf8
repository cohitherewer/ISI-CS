The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Russia shocked at rape probe 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Russia shocked at rape probe 
                            
	Panaji, Dec. 16 (PTI): Moscow today said it was astonished at the way Goa police was probing the alleged rape of a Russian girl by a state politician.        
	In a letter to chief minister Digambar Kamat, the consulate of the Russian Federation in Mumbai, said: We would like to express astonishment over the process of investigation in the case of rape of a Russian citizen by Indian national John Fernandes.        
	The letter, signed by Consul General Alexander Mantytsky, says a lot of time is being lost in gathering proof on the December 1 incident.        
	Even many days after the incident, the accused was not subjected to medical examination...the vehicle used by John to commit the offence was also not examined. The clothes he was wearing on the day of the offence were not preserved...During this time, all possibility to gather evidence was destroyed, Mantytsky said in the letter.        
	The consulate also noted threats to the victim that she would face the same fate as Elena Sukhanova, another Russian who was found dead under mysterious circumstances on rail tracks in Goa recently.        
	The embassy official said the consulate could advise Russian tourists to stay indoors if the police felt it would increase safety.        
	Because of poor security situation in Goa, foreign tourists might become victims of crime. We would inform our citizens not to remain outside (the hotel) after 10pm, if you suppose that it would assist in their security, the letter said.        
	The suggestion is being seen as a reaction to yesterdays remark by Congress MP Shantaram Naik that some rape victims invite trouble on themselves by socialising with strangers even during late hours.

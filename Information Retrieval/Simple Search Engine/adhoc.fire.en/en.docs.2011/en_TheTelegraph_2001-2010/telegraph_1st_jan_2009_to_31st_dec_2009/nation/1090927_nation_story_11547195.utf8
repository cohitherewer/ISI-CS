	Pittsburgh, Sept. 26: The Soviet Union has passed into history. With it has passed the bipolar view of world politics, and so has the religion called non-alignment. But loyalties take much longer to die than the real-world structures that generate them.         
	After the payments crisis of 1991, India had learnt from its mistakes, abandoned cherished policies of control and protection, and stopped fighting the developed countries. But now that it is prospering and growing, its leaders can afford to resume its pursuit of the leadership of less developed countries, and try to position India as their trade union leader.        
	In his speech to the G20 summit, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was explicit and insistent on this position. According to him, exports of less developed countries would be $900 billion lower in 2009 than in 2008; loss of exports would reduce income, government revenue, and public expenditure on infrastructure and social services.        
	It would heighten tensions, and make reforms more difficult. Developed countries should replace the vanished demand for developing-country exports with foreign aid for investment. Developed countries would profit from such investment because import content of investment is typically higher than that of consumption.        
	The World Bank is going to increase its lending by $100 billion in the next three years, but after that it will have to reduce it again because it is running out of capital. The countries which own it should double its capital. The cost would be tiny compared to the sums developed countries have been spending on stimulus packages. He also warned developed countries not to protect their industries, since that would reduce developing countries imports.        
	If we leave aside the politics of the speech, it was succinct and well argued. Trade has shrunk between all countries, more developed or less; but of course it has hurt the less developed countries. Old-style development aid would shore up their balances of payments, ameliorate crises and help maintain the growth of less developed countries. So development aid makes good sense. And channelling it through the World Bank avoids the biases and preferences built into bilateral aid.        
	The developed countries have been focused on the global financial crisis, and on shoring up the International Monetary Fund as one step in dealing with the crisis. Now that the crisis has faded and the economies of the developed countries are no longer shrinking, what could be better than that they should turn their attention to the World Bank?         
	The world need not be told just yet, but foreign aid, whether channelled through the World Bank or not, only postpones payments crises and does not prevent them. As Manmohan Singh suggested, foreign aid may finance infrastructure investment. But that would not increase exports or reduce imports, and would not therefore repair an adverse balance of payments. It can only be repaired if investment goes into export promotion or import substitution.        
	But as Indias own prolonged and unsuccessful experiments show, such directed investment does not work unless the export or import-replacing industries are internationally competitive; and making them such involves many things besides foreign aid. They must be exposed to competition, their owners must pursue technological excellence, and banks or the capital market should channel capital into efficient firms.        
	Avoiding protection and favouritism is even more important for less developed than for more developed countries, domestic competition is essential, and quality of entrepreneurship matters. And as East Asian countries showed, if domestic industries are internationally competitive, they need no foreign aid; the hunger of foreign markets for their exports will keep them growing.         
	For less developed countries, therefore, economic governance is crucial to the success or otherwise of foreign aid. But to tell them to improve the way they run their economies would be imperialism; it found no mention in Manmohan Singhs speech.        
	Not everything need be said in every speech; the Prime Minister will have many other opportunities to give sermons. I hope he will use some of them to tell less developed countries to reform themselves.        
	His message will carry even greater weight if he reforms the economy on which he holds sway  if he does not raid the treasuries of his public enterprises to subsidise the so-called poor, if he does not create unprecedented opportunities for corruption under the guise of giving employment, and if he does not make agriculture internationally uncompetitive by giving it protection it could do perfectly without.        
	But then, sermons are easy; reforms are not. And the government of a country that continues to do well economically can forget reforms and indulge freely in populist folly.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 17: One in three health centres in the country does not offer any diagnostic test, suggests a survey that doctors say has revealed large gaps in services for diagnosis and treatment of chronic diseases.         
	The 16-state survey by two non-government agencies has also detected gaps in quality and infrastructure such as blood banks, oxygen supplies, intensive care units, and ambulances in rural and urban health centres.         
	Only 245 of the 371 government and private clinics or hospitals covered by the survey had facilities for diagnostic tests to assess patients for diabetes, cardiovascular diseases or chronic kidney ailments.         
	The findings suggest that thousands of patients across India who need treatment for such conditions are likely to find it difficult to access both diagnostic services and treatment facilities.         
	The survey picked health centres in one district from each of 16 states  four each from Indias eastern, southern, western and northern regions.         
	Its a dismal scenario, said Anoop Misra, a diabetes specialist and chairman of the medical advisory board of Chronic Care Foundation, the NGO that commissioned the survey. We hope these findings will spur policy-makers into taking action.         
	We see deficiencies in both private and government centres, Misra said.         
	Researchers examined facilities at 311 private and 60 government centres  ranging from small private clinics and primary health centres to large tertiary-level hospitals offering speciality treatments.         
	While the absence of infrastructure in primary and secondary health centres was expected, researchers said, the lack of blood banks, well-equipped ambulances and intensive care units was visible even in some tertiary health centres.                     
	About one-third of the 39 centres that described themselves as tertiary institutions did not have intensive care units, said Prakriti Kamalakara, a researcher with the Social and Rural Institute in New Delhi, the agency that conducted the survey.         
	And only six in 10 of these tertiary institutions had ambulances equipped to transport critically ill patients.         
	A senior doctor in New Delhi said these findings raise questions about how the survey defined a tertiary health centre. Ambulances and intensive care units are expected to be routinely present in tertiary institutions offering speciality care.         
	The survey also suggested that important drugs against chronic illnesses arent always available on the premises of clinics or hospitals. Only 31 per cent of the 371 health centres had statins  cholesterol-lowering drugs. About half did not have oral anti-diabetic drugs.         
	Earlier studies have estimated that India has about 40 million patients with diabetes and the number of people with the risk of cardiovascular disease  heart attacks or strokes  exceeds 60 million.

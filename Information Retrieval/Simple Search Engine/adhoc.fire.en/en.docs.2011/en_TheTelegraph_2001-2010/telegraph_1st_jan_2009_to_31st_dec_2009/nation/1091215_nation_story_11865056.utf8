          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 14: The Centre today told the Supreme Court it proposed to tighten rules regulating lotteries across the country even as it slammed Bengal for trying to wriggle out of enforcing the one-draw-a-week rule.        
	The state can do it. West Bengal itself is not doing it, government counsel A. Mariarputham said, a week after the court had asked the Centre why lotteries shouldnt be banned to save the poor from frittering away their meagre earnings.        
	The December 7 query followed a court order late last month to Bengal to restrict draws of a lottery to once a week under the central act.        
	The leash came amid allegations that operators were tweaking names of lotteries to get around the law.         
	Mariarputham said the Lotteries (Regulation) Rules, 2009, had been framed and would be notified shortly, responding to a court notice on a public interest petition that sought to enforce the central act in Bengal and Sikkim.        
	In an affidavit filed in court, the Bengal government had claimed it can only prosecute for violation of Section 4(h) of the Lotteries Regulation Act, 1998, (which mandates one draw per lottery per week).         
	It had instead tried to lob the ball in the Centres court by saying it was up to the Union government to ban lotteries not being run in accordance with the 1998 law.        
	Under existing rules, a state government can ban sale of lottery tickets of other states and prohibit any other form of lottery in its territory provided it doesnt run any of its own.        
	The Bengal government runs weekly, monthly and bumper lotteries, though no online lotteries.        
	Among other things, the new central rules call for a complete ban on draws on national holidays, and restrict draws between 2pm and 7pm and to 50 daily per state, the counsel said.        
	Bengal resident Bibhash Karmakar had alleged that some eight draws were held every hour, and more than 90 draws every 12 hours.         
	At this rate a person would have to earn Rs 3 lakh per day to gamble on lotteries. No one can earn this much, he told a bench, headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan.        
	After hearing him, the bench directed Bengal to do all it could within the existing scheme of things against those operating online and other lotteries in the state. If any law is violated, the state should register FIRs against the erring persons and prosecute them, Balakrishnan said.        
	Another petitioner, from Haryana, had sought a complete ban on lotteries on the ground that the state shouldnt encourage the poor to gamble away their money.

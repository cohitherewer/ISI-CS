                                                                                                               Classic, not cotton, saris in Tihar Jail
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                              
	New Delhi, July 29: A Maharani, even in jail.        
	From the sprawling comforts of Lily Pool, the bungalow surrounded by greens and a lily pond she had built with her husband on Jaipurs Rambagh Palace grounds, the womens wing of Delhis Tihar Jail was a world apart. But Gayatri Devis dignity never failed her during her prison months in 1975.        
	She was a Maharani even inside the jail. She would see to it that no one misbehaved and was always particular that political prisoners kept their dignity and didnt sully their cause. She was very elegant. She would also sing patriotic songs with the other prisoners, recalled a Tihar official.        
	Known for her pastel chiffon saris, the London-born princess from Cooch Behar, arrested for violating tax laws, never gave up on her personal grooming even in jail.        
	During the meeting time assigned to us by prison authorities to meet visitors, she would come wearing her chiffon sari, the fragrance of her perfume wafting through the air.        
	She would also wear jewellery during the meeting sessions. While the other Rani (Rajmata Vijayaraje Scindia, who was also lodged in Tihar) had moved on to cotton saris, she stuck to her classic ones, said journalist Virendra Kapoor, who was jailed for 19 months during the Emergency.        
	Tihar officials who remember the five months Gayatri Devi spent in prison said the Maharani, a connoisseur of Rajasthani cuisine, and her cellmates had the same food  aloo ki sabji and arhar daal  that was served in buckets. She got food from outside too, but she ate what we gave her, though she didnt quiet enjoy it, laughed an official.        
	Kapoor recalled the food they were served. The sabji didnt have any aloo and the daal didnt have any daal. It was all water.         
	Male political prisoners could demand food according to the jail manual, which was much better, Kapoor said. But women, being small in number, had to have jail food. Only food, like biscuits which were brought by relatives, was allowed to be served.        
	Jail officials said Gayatri Devi bonded well with her cellmates but also had an air of a princess while dealing with them.        
	She was superior to all that she surveyed. She was nice, but always aloof. She maintained her distance from the other women who were in awe of her. She treated them as her subjects. She smiled at them, sometimes spoke to them but never mixed with them, recalled an official.        
	Gayatri Devi retired from politics soon after she got out of Tihar. Perhaps it was too much for her. She must have realised what real politics was all about. The food and the hard life must have got to her.        
	While the other Rani slogged it out for 19 months, Gayatri Devi, he added, bought peace in five.        
	After her release, Gayatri Devi went back to her charmed life in Lily Pool among her daisies and horses.

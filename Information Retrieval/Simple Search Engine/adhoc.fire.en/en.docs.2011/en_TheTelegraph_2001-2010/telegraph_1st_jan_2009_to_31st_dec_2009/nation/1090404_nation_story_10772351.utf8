The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | American general spills the K-word
                                                                                                               American general spills the K-word
  - Kashmir figured in talks between Pranab and US special envoy: Deposition         SUJAN DUTTA                                         (From top) Petraeus, Holbrooke, Mukherjee, Narayanan: Brainstorming                                       
	New Delhi, April 3: A key US general has claimed that Indian foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee and national security adviser M.K. Narayanan have discussed Kashmir with the special representative of US President Barack Obama on Afghanistan and Pakistan, according to depositions made to a US senate committee.         
	General David Petraeus, the commander of the US Central Command, who is leading military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and whose area of responsibility includes Pakistan, but not India, told a Senate Armed Service Committee hearing on April 1 that together with my great diplomatic wingman, ambassador Richard Holbrooke, this effort has actually started. He was asked by a Democrat senator if Washington was holding discussions with India and Pakistan to break the logjam over Kashmir.         
	General Petraeus did not specifically mention Kashmir in his deposition but was responding to the question by the senator, Mark Udall, according to a news release.         
	Holbrooke is due in India on April 7, specifically to brief India on the Afpak (Afghanistan-Pakistan) strategy that Obama unveiled last week.         
	Obama and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met in London yesterday on the sidelines of the G20 gathering of heads of governments. Before that meeting, Obama said he was urging New Delhi and Islamabad to carry on a dialogue. But Indias position is that there was little sense in talking unless Pakistan gave credible evidence of proceeding with investigations into Indias charges of its involvement in the 26/11 terror attack in Mumbai.         
	However, General Petraeuss revelation is the first by such a high ranking US government official that Kashmir was being talked as part of or on the margins of the Afpak strategy.         
	Washington has said in the past that Kashmir was not on Holbrookes agenda when he was named Obamas special representative. With India in the middle of an election season, too, it is unlikely that it will figure when he comes visiting next week.         
	But Kashmir figures in the calendar of major India-US exchanges and come July, after the polls, by when the next government in New Delhi would be formed, the Democratic establishment in Washington is expected to nudge for a dialogue on the dispute.         
	In a nuclear age, at a time when perhaps the greatest enemy of both India and Pakistan should be poverty... it may make sense to create a more effective dialogue between India and Pakistan, Obama said in London yesterday.         
	General Petreauss Central Command area of responsibility stops at the India-Pakistan border. In the US militarys scheme, India is in its Pacific Command area of responsibility. But Petraeus said Holbrooke and he himself had had meetings with Narayanan in Munich, Germany.         
	We had a very  what we thought was a very good discussion. That was followed up when the foreign minister of India came to Washington more recently, he was reported to have told the senate committee.         
	When ambassador Holbrooke went out on his maiden trip through the area, my deputy went with him and they were joined by the Pacific Command deputy for a swing into India as well after having been in Pakistan, he added.         
	The general said in the wake of the carnage in Mumbai, Islamabads attention was diverted when it should have been more focused in counter-terrorism in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region in Bajaur and other regions.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Prepaid cell ban in Kashmir
                                                                                                               Prepaid cell ban in Kashmir
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Oct. 30: The Centre today banned pre-paid mobiles in Jammu and Kashmir from November 1 because of security concerns.        
	Home minister P. Chidambaram, whose ministry announced the ban, indicated similar curbs could be clamped in insurgency-hit Northeast, too.        
	Around 90 per cent of Kashmirs 40 lakh cellphone subscribers have prepaid connections. From November 1, such new connections will not be issued, while existing wont be recharged. Mobile services started in the state  post-paid in 2003 and prepaid in 2004  years after it began in the rest of the country.        
	The ban was criticised by the states political parties. The government claims the situation has improved while on the other hand residents have been denied facilities like mobiles in the name of security threats, said Peoples Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti.        
	Ali Mohammad Sagar, law minister in the National Conference government, said: We will take up the issue with the Centre and seek a review (of the ban).        
	Operators feared big losses. Prepaid ones are cheap and easy to get. Lakhs will forego connections, said an Airtel official. Masharib Gul of the Centre-owned BSNL put the annual turnover of all operators from the state at Rs 1,700 crore. The move will certainly impact our business.        
	In Delhi, Chidambaram left little doubt Northeast could be next. It may become necessary to do the same (ban prepaid services) in the Northeast if the security situation warrants it.

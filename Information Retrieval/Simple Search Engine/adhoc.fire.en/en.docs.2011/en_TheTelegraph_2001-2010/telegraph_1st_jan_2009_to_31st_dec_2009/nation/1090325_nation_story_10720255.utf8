The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bush love in Left rancour
                                                                                                               Bush love in Left rancour
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Karat at the news conference in Delhi. (AP)                                  
	New Delhi, March 24: The Left hit back at Manmohan Singh in a repartee laced with sarcasm, hours after the Prime Minister called the CPM regressive.        
	Launching the Congress manifesto, the Prime Minister had used the word to criticise only the CPM, but the communists saw it as an attack on the Left as a whole.        
	CPM general secretary Prakash Karat led the counter-offensive, picking Singhs policies towards the US to heap scorn at him. This is the Prime Minister who went on record expressing his deep love for (former US President) George Bush. The Congress party should have included this in their election manifesto, he said.        
	Karat accused the Prime Minister of having violated the UPAs common minimum programme. The pressure to change the course of independent foreign policy, the military co-operation agreement, the nuclear deal and the US-dictated economic agenda... all this was a negation of the common minimum programme, he claimed.        
	CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan saw in the Prime Ministers remarks an acknowledgement that the Left had succeeded in halting the Centres wrong policies.         
	Yes, we negated all the harmful things the Congress-led government wanted to do. We negated all their wrong policies. That is what the Prime Minister is acknowledging today, Bardhan claimed at a programme where the leaders of the four Left parties appealed to people to vote for them.        
	Bardhan said the dilution of equity of PSUs, privatising bank and insurance sectors and investing pension funds in stocks were among the measures the Left had negated.        
	Both Karat and Bardhan said the anti-people policies of the UPA government and its strategic ties with the US (including the nuclear deal) had heightened the burden of the people and compromised national sovereignty.        
	Bardhan iterated the claim, made by other leaders earlier, that the Left had helped India face the slowdown better. Its impact on our economy was not as hard as it would have been otherwise.        
	On the Congresss charge that the Lefts moves had helped the BJP grow, Karat said the party had not been stopped or defeated in Congress-ruled states. By contrast, the Left-governed states of Bengal, Kerala and Tripura do not have a single BJP legislator, he said.        
	On the Congresss criticism of the third alternative, Bardhan said the party had tried to ignore the combine until a few weeks back but was forced to take notice.        
	Now they are being provoked to come out as they are rattled by the developments. Earlier they fielded Pranab Mukherjee and now the Prime Minister and Sonia Gandhi are being provoked to come out and criticise us. This reflects the growing strength of our front.

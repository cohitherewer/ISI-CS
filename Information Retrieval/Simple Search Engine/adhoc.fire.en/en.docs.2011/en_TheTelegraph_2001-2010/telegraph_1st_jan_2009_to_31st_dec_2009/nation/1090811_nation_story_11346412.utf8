The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | SC on parental abduction
                                                                                                               SC on parental abduction
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 10: The Supreme Court has ruled that parental abduction of a child in a marital dispute per se will not qualify for extradition of an Indian citizen.         
	It has also held that Interpol notices are not sacrosanct and will be subject to review by Indian courts.         
	The court said this while ruling on an appeal by US-based NRI Bhavesh Jayanti Lakhani against a Bombay High Court order dismissing his plea for a stay on an Interpol Red Corner notice.         
	The notice, based on a US court order, followed a complaint by his estranged wife Hetal saying the software engineer had abducted their daughter and flown to India on forged papers.        
	When a person complains of a violation of his fundamental right and/or otherwise (in Interpol notices), he is entitled to the right of judicial review, a two-judge bench said in the ruling on Friday.        
	Lakhani had argued that the notice, empowering the CBI to keep him under surveillance, arrest and detain him, went against his fundamental right to liberty.        
	The high court had held that courts would not normally tinker with Red Corner notices. But the Supreme Court negated the view, saying courts would scrutinise such notices and how they were sought to be enforced whenever an Indian citizen complained of violation of rights.         
	In this case, the apex court held that the dispute between the parties was essentially a matrimonial dispute, a private dispute. Therefore, it was not enough ground for extradition unless a court established any other criminal offence, such as forgery.         
	The apex court made it clear a Red Corner notice by itself could not be a basis for arrest or transfer of an Indian citizen to a foreign country. He can only be held if the offence is recognised as one under Indian law, and after a warrant issued by an Indian court.         
	The ruling clears the air on Interpols Red Corner notices, which have often been treated as de facto international arrest warrants.

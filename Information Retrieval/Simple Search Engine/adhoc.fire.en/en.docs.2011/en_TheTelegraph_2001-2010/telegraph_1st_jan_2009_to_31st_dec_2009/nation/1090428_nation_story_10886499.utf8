	Chennai, April 27: Between the plate and the paisa stood the eagle-eyed Election Commission. So the candidates came up with new ways  to keep the money flowing and the voters happy.        
	Last seen: women voters were placing their aarati plates at a spot decided earlier and a campaign manager was dropping currency notes on each, long after the candidate had come, canvassed and gone.        
	Who said voters were being bribed? Eh?        
	Women with aarati plates welcoming guests has been a tradition in Tamil Nadu  which votes on May 13  but in election time, the plate has often turned into a dish for a tip.        
	For candidates, dropping a 50- or 100-rupee note, or even Rs 500, on the plates is hardly a pinch. For women voters of the area, holding aloft the plates  containing kumkum (powdered turmeric or saffron) dissolved in water and burning camphor  means a quick buck with little effort.        
	During a recent by-election, however, DMK boss M. Karunanidhis son M.K. Stalin was caught on camera handing over a 500-rupee note to a person from his campaign vehicle. While the Opposition screamed it was blatant bribery, Stalin said it was a gift to a baby he had just named.        
	With the incident still fresh in his mind, Stalins elder brother M.K. Azhagiri figured out a different way to tip the women welcoming him with aarati plates in Madurai, his constituency. A sidekick was found handing over numbered tokens to the women who had performed the aarati.        
	After Azhagiris campaign vehicle had left the area, the women, the plan was, would exchange the tokens for money at the local DMK functionarys house.        
	DMK managers thought they had come up with a foolproof ploy, but they couldnt fool the media.        
	Soon, they were scratching their heads for a new trick.        
	A little brainstorming came up with what looked like a flawless plan: instead of tokens, the women were given campaign pamphlets with serial numbers. The pamphlets would later be exchanged for money.        
	When the Opposition ADMK saw through the trick and cried foul, the Election Commission asked its officials to seize any campaign material with any kind of special markings.        
	Chief electoral officer Naresh Gupta said the poll panel had ordered a crackdown on any form of tipping on election eve.        
	If we dont tip these women, we end up antagonising prospective voters, rued a DMK candidate in Chennai city. If we tip them, we earn the wrath of the Election Commission. Hence we have to find such devious methods to reach the money to them.        
	Supporters of K.C. Palanichamy, DMK candidate from Karur, central Tamil Nadu, seem to have found one. Well after the candidate had left, the women would assemble at a designated place with their aarati plates.        
	Soon, a campaign manager would trot along, placing 50-rupee notes on each plate.        
	Crisp and simple.

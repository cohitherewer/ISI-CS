The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Twin demands from minorities
                                                                                                               Twin demands from minorities
          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, June 30: The minorities cannot mark time any longer: having waited almost 17 years for the Liberhan report, they are demanding that the dossier be made public at the earliest and time-bound action taken.        
	The Babri Masjid Action Committee, a conglomeration of Muslim groups, today urged the Centre to place the Babri report before Parliament in the budget session starting July 3.        
	I appeal to the government to table the report in Parliament and take concrete action within three months, said Zafaryab Jilani, the Babri committee convener.        
	He claimed that political parties were playing hide-and-seek with the report, and accused the Congress and the BJP of holding it up.        
	Both the BJP and the Congress came to power after the commission was formed, but even then it took 17 years to submit the report, Jilani said.        
	I have come to know that the commission completed its work in 2006 but the Congress delayed it because of political reasons. It feared the commission may hold partymen responsible for the demolition of the masjid.        
	S.Q.R. Illyas, the convener of the Babri Masjid Committee of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, echoed Jilani. He said the report, as well as the action-taken report, should be tabled in the next session.        
	Others took aim at the time the commission, which got 48 extensions, took to submit the report. Syed Ahmad Bukhari, the head cleric of Jama Masjid, said the long time taken was a perfect case of justice delayed amounting to justice denied.        
	The very fact that it took 17 years to submit the findings amounts to befooling Muslims, he claimed.        
	The Liberhan commission got 48 extensions after it was set up within 10 days of the demolition of the 16th century mosque on December 6, 1992. The panel was to submit its report by March 16, 1993.         
	But it sought repeated extensions to complete its investigation. The last three-month extension was given in March this year.        
	Bukhari claimed submission of the report amounted to nothing because the government could sit on it for a long time.         
	Only if it is tabled at the earliest will it be known whether the commission has held the real culprits responsible for the demolition or not, he said.         
	Some are suspecting the government might hold up the report. Since there is not going to be any election soon, the government can sit on it for any length of time and release it when it suits them, said Tasleem Rehmani of the Muslim Political Council.        
	The delay in filing the dossier had grabbed international attention after Asma Jahangir, the special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief of the UN human rights council, mentioned it in her report.                    
	While an inquiry into large-scale communal violence should not be done in indecent haste, it should be accorded the highest priority both by the investigation, the judiciary and any commission appointed to study the situation. Unreasonable protraction of the inquiry only keeps tensions simmering and devalues justice, Jahangir had said.        
	I was astonished to learn that just before I arrived in India, the Liberhan Commission --- probing the circumstances leading to the 1992 demolition of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya --- got the 44th extension to conclude its inquiry.

                                                                                                               Srinagar bus blast kills cops amp; woman
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                              
	Srinagar, Sept. 12: A car bomb ripped through a police bus outside Srinagars Central Jail, leaving two policemen and a woman dead and nine injured.        
	The attack, the worst militant strike in Srinagar in more than a year, has come amid a spurt in infiltration bids across the Line of Control.        
	The explosion took place in Srinagars old city area of Rainawani, barely 50m from the gate of the jail, around 6pm when people were heading home to break the Ramazan fast. The bomb was in a parked car.        
	The Jamait-ul-Mujahideen has claimed responsibility. A spokesperson for the outfit telephoned a news agency minutes after the blast.        
	Kashmir police chief Farooq Ahmad said the police bus had carried detainees to the jail from Pulwama district. The bus dropped the detainees at the jail and was returning when the explosion occurred, he said.        
	Two policemen and a woman who was walking near the bus died. The woman was identified as Khatija of Khawja-Yarbal. The policemen who died are assistant sub-inspector Sagar Singh and head constable Abdul Hameed.         
	The toll is likely to go up as the condition of some of the injured is serious.         
	The police have announced a reward of Rs 10 lakh for information on the militants behind the blast.

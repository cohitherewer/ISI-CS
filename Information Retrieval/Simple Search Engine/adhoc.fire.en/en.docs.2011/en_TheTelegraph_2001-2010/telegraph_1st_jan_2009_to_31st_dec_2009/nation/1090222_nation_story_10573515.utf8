	New Delhi, Feb. 21: Condemned to death, Moninder Singh Pandher is unlikely to go scot-free so easily.        
	Buoyed by the Noida businessmans conviction for the murder of 14-year-old Rimpa Haldar, families of other Nithari victims say they will press for treating him as a co-accused in the remaining 18 cases.        
	From the beginning, I always knew and believed that Pandher was also involved. I had told police in my statement that my son went missing from February 23 and, on February 25, I saw Pandher in his house. Despite this, the CBI claims he was in Canada from February 23 to 28 and gave him a clean chit, said Ramkishan, whose three-and-a-half-year-old son was allegedly murdered by the businessman and his servant Surender Koli.        
	Now, I will make sure that I tell the court that I want Pandher punished.        
	Pappu Lal, another grieving father whose daughter Rachna was one of the victims, said he had clearly mentioned in his statement that he held Pandher guilty. There is no way he can go scot-free.        
	On February 13, a Ghaziabad court sentenced Pandher and Koli to death for the February 2005 rape and murder of Rimpa.         
	The judgment came as a slap in the face for the CBI, which claimed the 55-year-old didnt know 19 children and women had been slaughtered in his house.        
	A lawyer representing families of four victims said he would try and get Pandher summoned to court so that he can be tried as co-conspirator with Koli, who has confessed to the murders.         
	I am going to invoke Section 319 of the CrPC and get Pandher to court in all my cases, said Jhabber Singh Main.         
	Under the section, a person who has not been named an accused in a crime can be tried along with the suspects if fresh evidence suggests he could be guilty. The section has been invoked in five of the cases and Pandher has already been handed death sentence in one.        
	On Monday, when the case of seven-year-old Arti came up, her father Durga Prasad, who has appointed a Supreme Court lawyer, told the CBI special court the family wanted Pandher to be named a co-accused.        
	Prasad had accused only Koli in an earlier statement, but now says the CBI forced him to believe that Koli was the one who murdered his daughter and that Pandher was away. The next hearing has been scheduled for March 4.         
	Pandhers son Karandeep has hired former Delhi High Court judge R.S. Sodhi to defend his father. As a judge, Sodhi had sentenced several convicts to death, including law student Priyadarshini Mattoos killer Santosh Kumar Singh. Now, he will be fighting to save someone from the gallows.

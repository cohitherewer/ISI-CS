The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Dirty trick cry in Shopian case
                                                                                                               Dirty trick cry in Shopian case
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                              
	Srinagar, Aug. 29: An additional advocate-general who was representing the Jammu and Kashmir government has claimed he was given the sack for not introducing some fallacious content into the Shopian rape and murder case.        
	The government said there was no truth to his claims.        
	Syed Riyaz Hussain, the additional advocate-general, said he was dismissed after he refused to incorporate some controversial points in the governments account.         
	The government wanted to put up some points, which I disagreed with because these were fallacious and stupid, he said, but did not elaborate what they were.        
	The Shopian incident of May, when two women were allegedly raped and killed by securitymen, sparked furious protests across Kashmir and confronted Omar Abdullah with his first major crisis since taking over as chief minister in January. Omar added fuel to the fire when he initially attributed the deaths of the women to drowning.         
	Hussain said he had earlier picked holes in the government investigations, which, he claimed, was disliked by higher-ups.        
	I told them (the government) that certain things should have been done which were not. But it has not suited them in their political scheme. Last night I was called in by the government and informed about the decision (to dismiss him), he said.        
	State law secretary Akhtar Kochak, however, disputed Hussains version.         
	It is not he alone but several other additional advocates-general who are being replaced by the government. They were asked to resign which they did, he said.        
	These additional advocates-general were appointed by the previous government and it is the prerogative of the present regime to have new faces, an official said.

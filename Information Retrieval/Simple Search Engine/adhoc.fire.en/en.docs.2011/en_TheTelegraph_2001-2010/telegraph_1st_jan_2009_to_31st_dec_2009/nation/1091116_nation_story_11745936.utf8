	New Delhi, Nov. 15: A former warden of Tihar jail has been arrested in the capital along with three members of his gang who targeted hawala operators by allegedly masquerading as policemen.        
	Sandeep, 36, the alleged gang leader and former warden dismissed two years ago on charges of corruption, Mukesh, 25, Nayeemuddin, 29, and Jagjit Singh, 36, were arrested from Jor Bagh-Lodhi Road on Friday on a tip-off.        
	They preferred to strike against traders who also deal in illegal hawala transactions as such people hesitate to come forward to lodge a formal complaint with police, deputy commissioner (south) H.G.S. Dhaliwal said.        
	Police sources said 15 cases of abduction, kidnapping, snatching and robberies had been solved with their arrest.        
	Three pistols with live cartridges, a knife and three vehicles were seized from the quartet.        
	They used to masquerade as policemen to target hawala operators, the police officer said. Officials said the four had told interrogators they used to lure drivers employed with the businessmen involved in the hawala racket and through them got information regarding transactions.        
	The gang won over a few drivers employed with businessmen dealing in hawala transactions. Two such drivers and one Muneem, who worked for a businessman, have been identified, Dhaliwal said.

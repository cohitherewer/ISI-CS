The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Surgical strikes 
                                                                                                               Surgical strikes 
                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 8 (PTI): Army chief General Deepak Kapoor has said surgical strikes against the terror infrastructure in Pakistan were very much feasible.        
	Surgical strikes are definitely feasible, but whether you wish to take that decision or not is a separate issue, he said when asked about the possibility in the wake of the Mumbai attacks.        
	Definitely yes. Whether you would like to look at doing it (carrying out the strikes) by air or artillery or by other means or being physically there.        
	Asked if the armed forces would be ready if the political leadership gave the go-ahead, Kapoor said: We have been involved in operations in Kashmir on a perpetual and ongoing basis. Therefore, the question of not being ready is frankly not relevant. And we would have been fully ready to do our task.

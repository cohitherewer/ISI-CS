The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | RJD dons wife does a Rabri
                                                                                                               RJD dons wife does a Rabri
          NALIN VERMA                          Rabri                                  
	Patna, March 31: Heena Sahab has spent most of her 36 years indoors, immersed in the scriptures and household chores. Now the devout housewife has to step out every day to speak to crowds of strangers from behind her burqa.        
	Its not a situation her powerful husband, don Mohammed Shahabuddin, would have wanted. But his hands are tied.        
	A court conviction has barred the Sultan of Siwan, winner the last four times, from contesting the polls and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) is banking on Heena to milk voter sympathy for its imprisoned Robin Hood.        
	Political rivals have framed my husband in false cases. I am going to the voters requesting them to give him (Shahabuddin) strength by voting for me, Heena says.        
	The parallel between Heena and Rabri Devi, the wife of Shahabuddins mentor and party boss Lalu Prasad, is hard to miss.        
	When Lalu Prasad had to step down as chief minister and go to jail in 1997 in a fodder scam case, he got the homemaker Rabri installed in his chair. She then contested and won an election for the first time to hold on to the chair.        
	If the RJD has its Heena, ally Lok Janshakti Party has a Veena  another don wife in the fray for the first phase of polling on April 16, when 13 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar elect their MP.        
	Veena Devi, whose husband Surajbhan has been convicted in a criminal case, is contesting from Nawada against the BJPs Bhola Singh and a Congress rival.        
	In Siwan, Heena is pitted in a four-corner contest against Janata Dal (United) nominee Brishen Patel, the Congresss Vijay Shankar Dubey and CPI-ML (Liberation) candidate Amar Yadav.        
	Brishen, who had won from Siwan in 1991 before Shahabuddin took control of the north Bihar seat, is resting his hopes on chief minister Nitish Kumars good performance. Yadav is relying on his Naxalite cadres to take on Shahabuddins strong-arm politics.        
	Lalu Prasad is contesting from adjoining Saran. His reputation for being lucky has been vindicated again, with the Congress nominee failing to arrive on time to file his nomination.        
	That has left the RJD boss facing a relatively weak BJP nominee, Rajiv Pratap Rudy, whom he had trounced in 2004. The BSP too is in the fray.        
	JD(U) strongman Prabhunath Singh, enmeshed in a string of murder and robbery cases, is trying to retain the Rajput-dominated Maharajganj seat. His main challengers are the RJDs Umashankar Singh and the Congresss Tarkeshwar Singh.        
	Congress heavyweights Nikhil Kumar and Meira Kumar may find the going tough in Aurangabad and Sasaram. The RJD has fielded nominees from both seats, and a resurgent NDA too is expected to mount a serious challenge.

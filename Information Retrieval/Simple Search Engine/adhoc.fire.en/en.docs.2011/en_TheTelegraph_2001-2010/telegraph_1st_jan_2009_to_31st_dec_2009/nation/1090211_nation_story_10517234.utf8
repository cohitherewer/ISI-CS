	New Delhi, Feb. 10: A key parliamentary panel has cleared the right to education bill that makes schooling a fundamental right for all children between 6 and 14.        
	The standing committee on human resource development has approved the bill, raising the possibility that the landmark legislation may be passed in the short upcoming session of Parliament.         
	The committee, headed by the Congresss Janardhan Dwivedi, has submitted its final report accepting explanations of the HRD ministry to queries it had raised, sources said.         
	The ministry will now try to get both Houses of Parliament to clear the Right to Free and Compulsory Education for Children Bill, 2008, in the two-week session beginning on February 12, sources said.         
	The bill was introduced in the Rajya Sabha in December 2008 but referred  as is the practice  to the standing committee.         
	Sources on the panel said they had consciously met more frequently than usual to expedite the review of the bill.

                                                                                                               Tit-for-tat whiff in IPL churn 
  - Split over fresh auction seen behind img separation          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                                                                  
	Mumbai, Aug. 31: A discord over a fresh auction for players in 2011 which would make superstars like Mahendra Singh Dhoni available for bidding appears to be at the heart of the Indian cricket boards scrap with IMG, the international event management company that has been handling the Indian Premier League (IPL) since inception.        
	IMG is backed by IPL commissioner Lalit Modi, who, sources in the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) said, is facing the heat from both the cricket and political establishments.        
	The board has decided to part ways with IMG from the 2010 season.        
	A top BCCI source said the move was a sort of tit-for-tat volley fired by N. Srinivasan, the powerful board secretary who also owns Chennai Super Kings, at Modi.        
	Neither the BCCI secretary nor Modi could be reached for comment.        
	At the root of the tension, the source said, lies Modis latest proposal for a new player auction for 2011.        
	All IPL players have been contracted for three years, from 2008 to 2010.        
	A new auction will put some franchisees in trouble  they have to disband their teams and forgo the investment they made on some players to promote them as brands. Other than franchises like KKR which do not have the best T20 cricketers, not many will benefit. The biggest loser will be Srinivasans Chennai Super Kings, said the BCCI source.        
	Chennai, which spent a fortune on building its brand around Dhoni after buying him for a then record $1.5 million in 2008, could lose their biggest star in case of fresh bidding.        
	The Indian skipper is on the wishlist of many teams, including Shah Rukh Khans Kolkata Knight Riders.        
	SRK is very fond of Dhoni, who will also appeal to a larger audience across the country. Shah Rukh has been keen to drop the word Kolkata from Knight Riders since last year  that way our catchment area increases, said a source close to the actor.        
	The board source said franchisees had informally told the IPL management they should be first allowed to negotiate with a player once his contract ended.        
	BCCI bosses said they parted ways with IMG not just for over-charging the board.        
	They over-reached and claimed a 10 per cent share in the profits. Backing them are some big names in the IPL who brag they can run the tournament without the BCCI if necessary, said the BCCI source.        
	Sources said the BCCI top brass hit the roof when IMG apparently demanded a 10 per cent share of the Rs 661-crore profit IPL made in its first edition.        
	BCCI has already paid IMG Rs 42.92 crore ($9.54 million approximately) for IPL Season I. For Season II, they will be paid Rs 33 crore. Not a penny more, said a BCCI working committee member.        
	IPL sources scoffed at the explanation. It is shocking that they (BCCI) do not want to share the booty with the foot-soldiers now that they have won the war, said an IPL source.        
	The board had entered into a preliminary agreement with IMG in 2008, promising a 10 per cent payout of the tournaments gross revenue as commission. IMG, surprisingly, had not signed any contract with either the IPL or the BCCI.        
	IPL officials are livid with the board for playing Big Brother. IMG gave the IPL a global branding and image. They shifted the tournament to South Africa at the shortest notice. They deserve to be treated better. We will discuss this at our governing council meeting on Wednesday, said an IPL official.        
	Four of the franchisees  Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians, Rajasthan Royals and Delhi Daredevils  have shot off letters to the BCCI protesting against the marching orders to IMG.        
	The letters are being seen by BCCI officials as a joint move by some team owners to back Modi.        
	Apart from Chennai, the Deccan Chargers has so far stayed out of the tussle.        
	IMG was a bit partial to the so-called more glamorous teams of the IPL. So we are not surprised they are backing them, said a source in Deccan Chargers.

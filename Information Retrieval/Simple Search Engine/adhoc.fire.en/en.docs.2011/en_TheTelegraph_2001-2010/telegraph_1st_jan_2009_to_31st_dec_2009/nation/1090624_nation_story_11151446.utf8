The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sibal signal on varsity scan
                                                                                                               Sibal signal on varsity scan
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           Sibal: No politics                                  
	New Delhi, June 23: Politicians associated with deemed universities will not be allowed to influence the governments review of these institutions, human resource development minister Kapil Sibal has said amid concerns that political pressure may affect the probe.         
	No policy of the government should be allowed to be manipulated for any purpose except public good, Sibal told The Telegraph in an interview yesterday.        
	Sibals assurance comes amid concerns within the countrys higher education community that the probe into private deemed universities will face opposition from powerful politicians associated with these institutions.         
	A majority of private deemed universities have politicians  across party lines  or their kin on governing bodies, according to their own claims posted on websites or official documents.         
	Many of these institutions received deemed varsity status after requests from politicians, government sources said.         
	Sibal, on June 4, had ordered a University Grants Commission review into all deemed universities after repeated allegations of violation of norms in the grant of the status under his predecessor Arjun Singh.         
	A few days later, he asked the HRD ministry to conduct its own independent probe parallel to the UGCs review, in a move viewed as a slight to the higher education regulator.         
	The minister indicated that not all deemed universities found lacking in required standards would be stripped of the controversial status.         
	The intent is to ensure that whichever institutions are lacking must fulfil the required criteria. If any deemed university wantonly, and with intent, chooses not to comply with requirements, legal action will follow, Sibal warned.         
	He, however, said his ministry would ensure that students in these institutions do not suffer from any action against their institute.         
	It is an inquiry to determine whether requirements for granting deemed university status were diluted at all. My intent is to reform the education system, not take punitive action, Sibal said, when asked whether his probe would cover any officials of the HRD ministry or the UGC found complicit in bypassing norms in granting deemed varsity status.         
	I want to change the entire edifice of our education system. I want to do for education what Prime Minister Manmohan Singh did in 1991 for the economy.         
	The proposed foreign education providers bill will protect both the quality of education and check against institutions that are rapacious to charge fees way beyond the means of Indian students, Sibal said.         
	But the minister clearly specified that the UPA alone deserved credit for the regulations in the bill to prevent fly-by-night operators, which were concerning the Left.         
	Lets be clear. The structure of the bill had nothing to do with the attitude of the Left parties towards it. They were, after all, not a part of the group of ministers that approved the bill, Sibal said.         
	But if our students can receive the same quality of education of a foreign university here, at half the cost, I dont see why our children have to spend $7 billion annually to go abroad to study. Sibal was citing the estimated average annual cost of foreign education incurred by Indians.         
	The HRD minister also dismissed concerns raised by several university vice-chancellors and the UGC over the proposed new world-class universities, creating another layer in the hierarchy of the countrys higher education institutions.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Home cries for cash
                                                                                                               Home cries for cash
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 17: The home ministry is upset at having been given less money than the defence ministry in yesterdays interim budget, with officials arguing the Mumbai attacks justified a similar hike for both.        
	Home minister P. Chidambaram had lauded Pranab Mukherjees interim budget, which cited the November strike to announce a 35 per cent hike in outlay for defence but increased the home ministrys purse by 25 per cent.        
	The Centre has iterated after the attack that internal security is top priority. But home ministry officials complained the budget allocations imply that security was being viewed only from the prism of external aggression, which involves defence forces.         
	The cleavage between the army and the paramilitary is widening and this will affect performance, a senior official of a paramilitary force said.         
	He said internal security had to be fortified after the Mumbai attack, suggesting the home ministry would require as much, if not more, funds from the budget.        
	So, why did Chidambaram sing paeans to the budget? Some officials said he might have been speaking more as a former finance minister than a serving home minister.        
	Another group of officials suggested Chidambaram, who had spiked several proposals of the home ministry as finance minister, was now getting a taste of his own medicine.        
	Even in what the home ministry has been given, discontent is brewing over the manner the money has been distributed. The largest hike among the paramilitary forces has gone to the Assam Rifles, which is part of the home ministry but under the operational command of the army.        
	Ajai Sahni of the Institute for Conflict Management said the finance ministry might have decided on the steep hike for defence before the attacks and was now trying to justify the move by citing it.         
	The skewed budgeting for external and internal security agencies shows a complete lack of a strategic doctrine.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Patna, Sept. 25: Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar today ruled out the removal of expelled BJP MP Jaswant Singh as the chairman of the Houses public accounts committee.         
	The rules of parliamentary business stipulate that he (Jaswant) can function in the post (PAC chairman) till he is qualified and fit to do so, the speaker said categorically, adding: Jaswant Singh will continue to function as the PAC chairman.        
	When reminded that the BJP had asked for removal of its Darjeeling MP, who was dismissed from the party, as the PAC chairman, Meira said: Parliament functions in accordance with its rules. All parties have to work according to the rules laid down to run the House.        
	The BJP had expelled Jaswant Singh from the party following his praise of Pakistans founder Mohammed Ali Jinnah in his controversial book Jinnah: India, Partition, Independence.        
	On August 31, deputy leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Sushma Swaraj, met Jaswant Singh and requested him to step down as the PAC chairman even though the post was offered to him keeping his seniority in mind. BJP and its ally, Shiv Sena, boycotted the first meeting of the PAC on September 7.        
	Unfazed by the protests, Singh said he was sure that the members would attend the upcoming meetings.        
	Jaswant had stated that it (the matter) was for the Speaker to decide.         
	Now, the Speaker settled the issue in his favour.         
	Meira Kumar was in Patna today to lay the foundation stone of an eye hospital to be run by the Employees State Insurance Corporation.         
	Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar accompanied her on the occasion. On the same day, Nitish laid the foundation of a 500-bed hospital and medical college at Bihta, about 35 km from here.

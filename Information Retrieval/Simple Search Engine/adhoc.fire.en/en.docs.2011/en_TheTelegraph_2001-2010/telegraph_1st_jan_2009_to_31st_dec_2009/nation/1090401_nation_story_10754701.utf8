                                                                                                               Raipur campaign
                            
	Raipur, March 31, (PTI): Ruling BJP in Chhattisgarh is set to launch the partys election campaign from tomorrow with a 12-day road show by its star campaigner, chief minister Raman Singh.        
	Talking to the media here today, on the eve of his whirlwind campaign for the April 16 election, Singh denied that he was under pressure to retain 10 out of 11 Lok Sabha seats that the BJP had won in the 2004 elections under his leadership.        
	I have always kept myself free from tension despite all odds, he said, and expressed optimism about clinching all the seats, banking upon the successful five-year rule of his government and the five years of UPA failure at the Centre.         
	A total of 228 candidates filed nomination papers for Chhattisgarh polls today.        
	Singh earlier organised a six-day Kisan Mahotshav (from February 23) distributing paddy worth Rs 440 crore and sops to farmers and then followed it up with a workers convention in all constituencies.         
	During the 12-day-long campaign, the chief minister is scheduled to address at least five public meetings daily and stage road shows with a special bullet-proof bus after sunset.        
	Police sources said there would be heavy security bandobast for him especially when he travels to Bastar.        
	On the opening day, Singh would start off his campaign by addressing the first meeting at Ambagarh Chowki in Rajnandgaon. He would be addressing three more rallies at Salehwara, Baghera and Pandaria before starting the road show from Kawardha, his home town.

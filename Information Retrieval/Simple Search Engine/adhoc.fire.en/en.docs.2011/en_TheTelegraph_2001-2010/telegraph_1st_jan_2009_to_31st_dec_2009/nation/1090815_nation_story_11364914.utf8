The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Relief for divorced woman
                                                                                                               Relief for divorced woman
                            
	Ahmedabad, Aug. 14 (PTI): A sessions court has ordered the release of a Muslim woman, who had recently divorced her husband and wanted to live with her Hindu boyfriend, from a remand home.        
	Shabana Rathod was lodged in the Nari Sanrakshan Gruh after an order from a local court.        
	Judicial magistrate N.P. Saiyed in an interim order on July 29 had said Shabana, 21, was to be kept at the remand home for four months and 10 days.        
	The order was given after her mother filed a complaint saying Shabana had not followed iddat  a period during which a divorced woman has to stay away from all men barring her father and brother  under Shariah laws.         
	Shabana filed a revision petition in the Bhavnagar sessions court where judge P.H. Baxi on July 31 quashed the lower court order, saying it was against law.        
	 The judge ordered Shabanas release from the remand home and she was reunited with her boyfriend Jitendra Baraiya.         
	The judge also observed that Shabanas confinement against her will was illegal as she was an adult. Her mother has now approached Gujarat High Court challenging the order.         
	Shabana was married to Altaf Hussain Saiyed of Vallabhipur in April but eloped with Baraiya after two months.

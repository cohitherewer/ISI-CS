The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | The big Left losers amp; the reasons they lost
                                                                                                               The big Left losers amp; the reasons they lost
                            
	Calcutta May 16: Left Front candidates were clearly at the wrong place at the wrong time when Bengal went to vote for Lok Sabha 2009. The stability at the Centre appeal of Sonia-Manmohan worked at the national level and Mamata Banerjees chime for change did the trick at the state level. But there were also some reasons at the ground level that led to the Left coalition being whipped. Here are some of the big losers and the small but significant reasons for their losses.              
	 Mohammad Salim/ Calcutta North        
	Salim and Co. believed he could pick up the bulk of the sizeable Muslim as well as Hindi-speaking votes in Calcutta North with his articulation, all-India image and secular credentials. But a bulk of the Muslim votes appears to have gone to the Trinamul, with the CPMs handling of the Rizwanur Rahman episode being a definite factor. BJPs Tathagata Roy picked up some votes. And Sudip Bandopadhyay rode a well-oiled party machine to the polls.              
	 Samik Lahiri/Diamond Harbour        
	A sitting MP for two terms, this favourite of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, was pitted against Somen Mitra of Rashtriya Indira Congress, contesting on the Trinamul symbol. Mitra trounced Lahiri, riding the disenchantment of nearly 30 per cent Muslim voters in the constituency and drawing upon a sizeable pool of Congress voters. Lahiri was severely handicapped by the weak and faction-ridden state of affairs in the CPMs South 24-Parganas unit.              
	 Sujan Chakraborty/Jadavpur:         
	The sitting MP found himself buried in five out of seven Assembly segments by Trinamuls Kabir Suman, a verdict that surprised even the singer-turned-politicians campaign managers. The land versus industry debate was most relevant in this urban-rural constituency with the proposed 84km Barsat-Raichak highway running through it. And then there was the loss of Muslim votes.              
	 Amitabha Nandi/Dum Dum        
	He was the favourite on paper following the Salt Lake-Rajarhat-New Town belt, known to be anti-CPM, going out of Dum Dum and into Barasat following delimitation. Ground-level disenchantment with the incumbent, the failure to figure out the power of the Trinamul campaign, the erosion of the Muslim vote and BJP candidate Tapan Sikdars inability to cut into anti-Left votes combined in Nandis defeat to Trinamuls Saugata Roy.               
	 Tarit Topdar/ Barrackpore         
	A past master at winning elections, Topdar was outplayed by Dinesh Trivedi, who kept the various Trinamul factions together, never allowed his campaign to suffer for want of funds, tapped into Muslim fears by talking about post-poll land acquisition and promising development. The absence of infrastructure development, closed factories and lack of growth opportunities added red marks to Topdars report card. His tough-guy image did not help.              
	 Hannan Molla/Uluberia        
	An MP for a record eight times, Hannan Molla was Mr Confident to begin with. A favourite of the top leadership, Mannan was expected to mop up the Muslim vote with ease. But Trinamuls Sultan Ahmed got his campaign planks right: lack of development and fear of land acquisition. Molla being missing in action in his constituency  he was busy setting up CPM bases in Rajasthan and other states  were also exploited by Trinamuls poll managers.              
	 Lakshman Seth/Tamluk         
	For many, the man who symbolises all that is wrong with the CPM. Much of the blame for the Nandigram fiasco lay at the door of this three-time MP. Trinamuls Subhendu Adhikary, a nimble-footed, affluent young man deployed his resources well to beat the bully in his backyard. Seth probably needed the hand of god to win this one; Adhikary probably didnt even need the hand of alliance.              
	 Jyotirmoyee Sikdar/ Krishnagar         
	The CPM was banking on two factors to power sitting MP Sikdar through this three-cornered race  the presence of a strong BJP candidate, lawyer Satyabrata Mukherjee, and the dissatisfaction in the local Congress ranks over the fielding of actor-turned-politician Tapas Paul. Though Mukherjee polled over 100,000 votes, Paul did a dadar kirti and made sure Trinamul got the bulk of the anti-Left votes.              
	 Rupchand Pal/Hooghly         
	Singur was just too close for comfort for this sitting MP, as the Nano tanked and newcomer Sucharu Haldar rode a wave. The CPMs machinery is malfunctioning in this region.

	 Bhopal: Papa Arjuns month-long lobbying to get a nomination for daughter Beena has ended in disappointment.          
	The Congress on Thursday announced the candidature of Sudhir Singh Tomar for the Satna Lok Sabha seat that Arjun Singh was eyeing for his daughter.          
	Observers said it was now obvious that the Union HRD ministers wish and recommendations were inconsequential for those calling the shots in the All India Congress Committee.          as candidature was bitterly opposed by Arjuns politician son Ajay, who was himself an aspirant for the Sidhi Lok Sabha seat.           , however, made it clear at AICC screening committee and central election panel meetings that he would prefer to see Beena as his successor.          
	Sources said that while seeking the ticket for Beena, Arjun sometimes became emotional about his unflinching loyalty towards the Nehru-Gandhi family.          
	But party leaders involved in candidate selection said their feedback showed Beena was a green horn and did not fit into the caste equations in Satna. Moreover, Arjun and Beena had not been in regular touch with local Congress leaders in Satna.           won Satna in 1991 but lost there in 1996. Since1998, the seat has been with the BJP.           
	The buzz in the Congress circles was that Arjun has fallen out with 10 Janpath  meaning Congress chief Sonia Gandhi. A recently released book authored by Arjuns close associate Ram Saran Joshi makes this obvious.           
	The book, Ek Sahyatri Itihas Ka, has quoted Arjuns wife Saroj questioning Sonias choice of President and wondered why her husbands unflinching loyalty was not considered. What harm would have taken place if she (Sonia) had made him the President of India, the person who gave his all to the service of the family? Saroj told Arjuns political biographer soon after Pratibha Patil was elected to the high office.          
	But Arjun struck a philosophical note. Ab theek hai, jo ho gaya so ho gaya (Now let it be, whats happened has happened), he said.          
	According to some Congress leaders, the timing of book and Arjuns tacit approval of its contents has not gone down well with the party leadership.           
	For instance, the book claims that three years ago when Arjun was under fire for implementing the OBC quota in central higher education institutions, he had complained to Sonia about Prime Minister Manmohan Singh not coming to his rescue.

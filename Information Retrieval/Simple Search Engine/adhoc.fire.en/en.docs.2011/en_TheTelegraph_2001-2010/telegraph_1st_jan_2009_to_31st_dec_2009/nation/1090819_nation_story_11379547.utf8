  - Eye on november crackdown, home minister to go to 7 states          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                          Chidambaram                                        
	New Delhi, Aug. 18: Home minister P. Chidambaram will visit each of the seven Naxalite-affected states, including Bengal, and speak to the chief ministers individually before finalising a new strategy against the rebels.        
	The series of meetings will take place ahead of a major offensive planned around November, sources said. He (Chidambaram) will meet everyone (all the chief ministers) before finalising (the strategy) but the home minister has asked them (states) to finish some preliminary work before that, said a senior official.         
	The dates of the visit have not been fixed, but Chidambaram is understood to have told the chief ministers that he would visit them next month to flesh out the new strategy.        
	However, before the anti-rebel blitz rolls, the aim is to first put key elements in place and learn from past operations.        
	The strategy being finalised includes extensive use of rural police and local intelligence set-ups which, like in Bengals Lalgarh, have collapsed. This has hampered the ongoing offensive against the rebels there.        
	Another important part of the planned strategy is wider use of paramilitary forces. The CRPF is already on the job in many areas, as is the BSF on a smaller scale. But now, the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) will also be deployed in Bengal, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, Bihar, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.        
	Sources said this would lead to some pullback of forces from the borders, in Jammu and Kashmir as well as in the east along Bangladesh.         
	On the operational front, too, attempts are on to make the strategy more cohesive. One plan is to deploy only one paramilitary force in each small area of operation so there are no contradictions in command and control.                    
	Under the new plan, the BSF may be engaged in some areas of Chhattisgarhs Bastar but the CRPF could be fighting in another theatre of the same 40,000sqkm rebel stronghold.        
	Although the plan was to hit hard at the rebels in September or October, the monsoon was seen as a hurdle. Upcoming elections in Maharashtra, and probably Jharkhand, also seen as a factor in planning the offensive in November.        
	Home ministry sources said although there was general agreement between the Centre and states on the strategy, only broad contours were laid out at yesterdays meeting that was called to specifically discuss Left-wing extremism.         
	Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee couldnt attend the talks as he was ill.         
	At the meeting, Chidambaram urged the seven states to strengthen their rural policing and intelligence networks. He also stressed the need to come up with an attractive surrender and rehabilitation policy to wean the Naxalites off the path of violence.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | MP siblings locked in advice war
                                                                                                               MP siblings locked in advice war
          RASHEED KIDWAI                                    Digvijay (top), Laxman: Counsels                                  
	Bhopal, March 26: Siblings torn apart by politics still have something left to offer each other  unsolicited advice.        
	Election season in Madhya Pradesh is witnessing one such spectacle. Laxman Singh, the BJP candidate from Rajgarh, said elder brother Digvijay should contest the Lok Sabha elections and suggested that by refusing to enter the fray, he was weakening Sonia Gandhi.         
	The four-time MP also dubbed Manmohan Singh an incompetent Prime Minister and claimed that Digvijay had once declined to become a minister under Manmohan.        
	Digvijay, a Congress general secretary, reacted by saying that Laxman would be better off advising L.K. Advani and the BJP, and told him not to worry about Sonia and Manmohan.        
	But Laxman wasnt done. Days later, he said Priyanka Gandhi, instead of advising cousin and BJP candidate Varun to read the Gita properly, should ask her brother Rahul and mother to speak Hindi properly.        
	Laxman is no stranger to controversies. While in the Congress, he had mocked senior leader Arjun Singh, then considered Digvijays mentor. On another occasion, Laxman had made offensive remarks about Uma Bharti, prompting Digvijay, then chief minister, to apologise.        
	Laxman had crossed over within days of Digvijays 2003 rout. According to sources close to Digvijay, he has been thinking of dividing the family property at Raghogarh, a small principality under the erstwhile Scindia fief.        
	The sources said the former chief minister had reason to be bitter because he had groomed Laxman more like a son than a younger brother. Laxman, too, would treat Digvijay, whom he called Dada-Bhai, as God.        
	Days back, Laxman sought Digvijays blessings by touching his feet when the brothers were at Raghogarh. Digvijay initially withdrew his feet before relenting. Locals said Digvijay may have changed his mind because he didnt want to violate his traditional role as the head of the family. Also, not blessing Laxman wouldnt have been in keeping with the promise Digvijay had made to his late parents that he would look after his brother.        
	Another family spat has been unfolding in Gwalior, adjoining Laxmans Rajgarh constituency. Jyotiraditya Scindia, the Congress MP of nearby Guna, is trying to queer aunt Yashodhara Rajes pitch as the BJP candidate by claiming he is the sole representative of the mahal (Gwalior Fort). Yashodhara Raje insists that as the sitting Gwalior MP, she stands for both the palace and the people.

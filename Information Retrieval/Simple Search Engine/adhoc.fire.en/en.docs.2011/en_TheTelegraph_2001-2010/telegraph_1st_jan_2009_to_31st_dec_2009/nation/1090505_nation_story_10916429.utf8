The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Black money whack for govt
                                                                                                               Black money whack for govt
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 4: The Supreme Court today refused to throw out a public interest petition on bringing back black money stashed abroad by Indians, in a mid-election embarrassment for the government which was ticked off for not acting against the suspects.        
	Why has no action been taken under the Money Laundering Act? Justice M.K. Sharma, one of the judges on a bench headed by the chief justice, asked the Centres counsel.        
	The decision to reject the governments plea came after the court had heard out arguments by six persons who filed the PIL and the government, which alleged that people with suspected BJP leanings were behind the petition. The issue is a major election plank of the BJP.        
	Advocate Anil B. Divan, who appeared for some of the petitioners, said: This has not been filed with an eye on elections. We want it to become an ongoing issue.        
	He shot down the governments contention that Swiss authorities had refused to share information on the ground of confidentiality. If a criminal case is filed, there is no bar to sharing information, he said. The Union government is just interested in protecting powerful people who hold their money benami.         
	Government counsel Gopal Subramanium urged the court to throw out the petition saying it was based on diatribes, web downloads and electronic broadcasts. But it rejected his plea and fixed July 20 for the next hearing.

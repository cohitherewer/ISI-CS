The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | 3 scientists, similar finish
                                                                                                               3 scientists, similar finish
                            
	Oct. 7: The three scientists who won the Chemistry Nobel reached the finish line almost simultaneously in 2000, publishing crystal structures that were sharply enough defined to locate atoms that make up protein-producing ribosomes.        
	All three scientists have used a method called X-ray crystallography to map the position for each of the hundreds of thousands of atoms.        
	Israeli Ada Yonath made the initial breakthrough at the end of the 1970s when she first tried to generate X-ray crystallographic structures of the ribosome, a feat most considered impossible.        
	The method involves aiming X-rays towards a crystal, which then scatter when they hit atoms. By looking at how the rays spread out, scientists can determine how atoms are positioned.        
	Yonath started by taking a micro-organism found in the nearby Dead Sea and crystallising its ribosomes. She did this by freezing them at nearly minus 200 degrees Celsius.        
	Jeremy Berg, director of the US National Institute of General Medical Sciences which funded all three scientists, told Reuters he was amazed at how intrepid Yonath was.        
	I remember at the time being just completely stunned that she was somewhere between brave enough and crazy enough because it was way, way, way beyond the technology available at that point, he said.        
	It would take another 20 years before a full map could be made. During that time, two others joined the race: Yale Universitys Thomas Steitz and Venkatraman Ramakrishnan of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Britain.        
	In 1998, Steitz published the first crystal structure of a large part of a ribosome, something that looked like a dim photograph. Then the three touched the finish line in 2000.        
	Scientists use ribosome models to develop antibiotics that can fight harmful bacteria.        
	Peter Brezinski, a member of the chemistry panel at the Royal Academy of Sciences in Stockholm, said researchers had only just begun to tap into the potential these models offered.        
	Fifty per cent of all antibiotics target the ribosome, and now we have the tools to begin looking at if there are other substances we can fit into different slots to block and disturb bacteria in our bodies, he said.        
	This is the second protein-related prize in a row. Last years Chemistry Nobel was awarded to researchers for the discovery of a glowing jellyfish protein that makes cells, tissues and even organs light up.        
	Previous winners have included Marie Curie, who won the 1911 prize and is remembered for her contribution to the fight against cancer, and Frederick Sanger, who won the 1958 prize for his work on the structure of proteins, especially insulin.                    BASED ON A REUTERS REPORT

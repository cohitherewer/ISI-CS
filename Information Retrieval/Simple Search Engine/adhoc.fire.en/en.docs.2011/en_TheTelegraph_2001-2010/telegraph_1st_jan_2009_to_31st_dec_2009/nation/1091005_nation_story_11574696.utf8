The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Molest case on scuffle pilots
                                                                                                               Molest case on scuffle pilots
                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 4 (PTI): Delhi police today registered a case of molestation against two pilots of an Air India flight for alleged mid-air assault on an air hostess.        
	Yesterday, the pilots and two cabin crew members of the Sharjah-Delhi-Lucknow flight got involved in a scuffle after steward Amit Khanna decided to beat an apology out of co-pilot Capt. Ranbir Singh for allegedly making disparaging comments about the air hostess.         
	The commander of flight IC-884, Capt. Aditya Chopra, tried to bring the duellers to their senses and manage the aircraft at the same time.         
	Satyender Garg, joint commissioner (operations), Delhi police, said a medical examination of the unidentified air hostess had confirmed injuries on her body.         
	Chopra and Khanna also received minor injuries during the scuffle.        
	The airline de-rostered Arora, Chopra, Khanna and the airhostess yesterday. The flight had 106 passengers on board.        
	An Air India spokesperson called the incident a clear case of indiscipline and said the airline would take stringent action against those found guilty.         
	The scuffle was reported shortly after the flight landed in Lucknow at 6am yesterday. The duel took place around 4.30 in the morning when the plane was cruising over Pakistan.         
	A three-member panel set up by Air India probed the incident and heard the parties involved. Details of the probe were not available.        
	Rat strikes AI again        
	A week after a rat forced the grounding of an Air India flight, 412 passengers aboard a Riyadh-bound plane of the national carrier were stranded today at Calicut airport as a rodent was spotted in the aircraft.        
	The engineers are inspecting the plane and a relief aircraft is being sent from Mumbai to ferry the stranded passengers to their destination, an Air India spokesperson said. The flight was scheduled to take off from Calicut airport at 2pm.        
	Since there is no fumigation facility available at the Calicut airport and a physical inspection would take time, a relief plane along with crew is being sentfrom Mumbai, the spokesperson said, adding that all the passengers had been lodged in hotels.        
	Engineers and technical staff of the airlines apprehended that the rat could damage the wiring.

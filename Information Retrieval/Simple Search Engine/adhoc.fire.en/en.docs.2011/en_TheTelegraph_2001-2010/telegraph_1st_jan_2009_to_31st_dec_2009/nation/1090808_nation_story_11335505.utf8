The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pay sets tech hierarchy
                                                                                                               Pay sets tech hierarchy
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 7: Faculty at the Indian Institutes of Information Technology will no longer receive salaries as high as their counterparts in IITs, under a new pay regime that redefines the hierarchy among Indias apex technical education institutions.         
	The IIITs and the Indian School of Mines in Dhanbad have been stripped of pay parity with the IITs and placed a peg lower with the National Institutes of Technology, top government officials told The Telegraph.         
	The new pay regime, approved by the cabinet yesterday, has hiked the salaries of teachers across all central technical institutions, keeping them above the pay of faculty at the countrys central universities.         
	Officials continued to remain tight-lipped about the exact amount that teachers at these institutions will receive.         
	But the pay hierarchy sharpens the governments definition of its premier institutions, relegating others to a second rung ignoring pleas for parity from their teachers, sources said.         
	The IITs, the IIMs, the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research and the National Institute of Industrial Engineering, Mumbai, have been placed in the apex set of institutions. Faculty at these institutions will enjoy the highest pay scales on offer in government educational institutions under the new regime, sources said.         
	But teachers at the IIITs  a brand of IT schools that India conceived a decade back to cash in on the countrys booming software industry  and ISM Dhanbad will have to settle for less.         
	As of now, faculty at the IIITs and ISM Dhanbad receive the same pay as the IITs, officials said.         
	The reason for this was that the former were considered the countrys top IT schools and the latter the apex mining institution. But the new pay regime recognises them as a grade lower than the IITs, a source said.         
	The IIITs and the ISM have been placed in a second rung  behind the apex set of institutes  with the NITs under the new pay structures, sources said. The same structure  of two rungs  will hold for salaries of directors of the institutes, with the heads of the IITs, IIMs, IISERs, IISc Bangalore and the NITIE receiving more than the rest.         
	The cabinets approval for salary hikes came after a government team fine-tuned recommendations of a panel it had appointed under former IISc Bangalore director Goverdhan Mehta to revise pay scales.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Didi in berth, call for fish curry on menu
                                                                                                               Didi in berth, call for fish curry on menu
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, June 1: The return of Mamata Banerjee at the helm of Indian Railways may herald the restoration of machcher jhol  a Bengali fish delicacy  on the menu offered to passengers on select routes.        
	Over 1,000km away from home in Delhi, Trinamul Congress members of Parliament are rooting for fish curry to be reintroduced to make their frequent travel between the capital and Bengal more palatable.         
	It isnt just me. In Parliaments central hall today, three persons came up to me and said I should ask Didi (Mamata) to bring back machcher jhol on the train menu. I will certainly ask Didi, an MP said at Mamatas residence, which doubles as the party office here.        
	Trinamul MPs and workers claimed that Mamata had introduced fish curry on lunch and dinner menus on key trains headed to or from Bengal during her tenure as rail minister under the NDA.         
	They alleged that Lalu Prasad, rail minister in Manmohan Singhs previous government, removed fish from the menus.        
	However, Lalu Prasad did start food plazas at several railway stations. Some stations in Bengal have plazas where machcher jhol is available, a railway catering and tourism corporation official said. But it is not available at present on Bengal-bound trains, he confirmed.        
	Mamata has made it clear that she wants her ministers to spend a lot of time each week in their constituencies in Bengal. However, they will also have to spend adequate time in their ministries to avoid charges of neglecting official work.        
	If they follow Mamatas diktat, each minister will make at least two train trips a week. Though they can fly too, party MPs and ministers have been advised to try and use trains as often as possible.         
	We have to keep travelling back and forth between Delhi and Calcutta, attending to our constituencies. It would be great if we could eat machch on the trains, said another MP, lodged at Banga Bhavan, around 3km from Parliament.         
	Some party MPs carefully couched the growing chorus for fish on trains as a demand of the party workers.         
	There is general demand from our workers, too, that Bengali food should be introduced on trains to the east. It should not be seen as parochialism it is but natural that people in Bengal want Didi to cater to their requests, an MP said.

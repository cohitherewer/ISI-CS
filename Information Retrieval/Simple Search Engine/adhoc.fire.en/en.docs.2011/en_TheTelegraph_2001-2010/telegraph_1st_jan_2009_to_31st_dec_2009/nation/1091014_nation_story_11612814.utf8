The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Graft raid reveals a Rs 24-crore cop
                                                                                                               Graft raid reveals a Rs 24-crore cop
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 13: A Delhi police officer whose take-home pay is around Rs 30,000 a month is under the scanner for stashing away a bit more  Rs 24 crore.        
	Sources in the Delhi governments anti-corruption bureau (ACB) said they began investigating Roshan Lal after word spread that the station house officer was flaunting his wealth.        
	We received complaints about Lals growing wealth. Understanding the seriousness of the matter, we started an investigation, an ACB official said.        
	The millions soon tumbled out.        
	The official said the crorepati cop, who joined Delhi police in 1978 as a sub-inspector, had assets worth Rs 24 crore and investigators had found documents from his house that revealed five bank accounts. Lal also reportedly owns a South Delhi plot worth more than a crore.        
	During investigations it was learnt that Lal has a few bank lockers, which contain cash and jewellery worth over Rs 2 crore. One of his brothers lives in Canada and is reportedly a very rich man. Lal runs a few buses that ply between Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Lals father used to run a small hotel in the Paharganj area, the ACB official said.        
	ACB officials said the multimillionaire cop had bought three hotels in the capital and a movie hall in Uttar Pradesh. The three hotels, all in Paharganj in central Delhi, are registered in the names of his brother and father.        
	We will decide what action to take once we get a report from the ACB, a top Delhi police official said.        
	Sources said Delhi police commissioner Y.S. Dadwal had asked for a list of officials who had corruption charges against them, but there was no official confirmation on this yet.        
	According to a list prepared by the ACB in January 2009, Delhi police topped the list of government departments whose officials were booked for corruption last year.         
	Recently, a right to information plea had revealed that while the Municipal Corporation of Delhi had topped a corruption chart with about 4,300 cases registered against its officials, Delhi police were fourth, with over 300 officials accused of graft.        
	Sources said if they wanted to, cops could earn through bribes and gifts nearly five times more than what their monthly salary is. Lal, they added, served mostly in lucrative police station areas like Paharganj, Karol Bagh, Kotwali and Kalyanpuri.        
	A senior police official said Lal was likely to be promoted as ACP next year.

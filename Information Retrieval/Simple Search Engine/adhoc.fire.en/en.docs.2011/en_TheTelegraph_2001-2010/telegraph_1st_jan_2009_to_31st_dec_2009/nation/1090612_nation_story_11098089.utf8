          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, June 11: His band of loyalists turned out in hordes to greet him, but the otherwise genial Lalu Prasad celebrated his 62nd birthday in a relatively subdued fashion with Rabri Devi, his children and RJD leaders.        
	As I have stated earlier, I am not aware of my birth date. But party workers like to celebrate a day and I respond to their greetings, said a rather philosophical Lalu, while sharing a few lines of a poem: Chand na badla, suraj na badla, na badla asmaan, kitna badal gaya insaan (The moon, the sun and the skies have not changed, but people have).        
	Lalu was probably trying to summarise the change in the attitude of both his one-time voters who shifted loyalty to the JD(U) and the Congress that no longer find the man, who executed a turnaround in the railways revenue, fit for ministerial birth.        
	Lalu had recited similar couplets for Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh in the Lok Sabha recently. Amid rumours of several MLAs deserting Lalu, Rabri Devi offered cake to MLAs Abul Bari Siddiqui and Shyam Razak.        
	However, addressing a meeting later, Lalus pride came to the fore. Jisko jana hai jai. Main janta ke paas jaunga. (Those who wish to go elsewhere can do so, I will only go to the public).        
	A fighter, Lalu reiterated that he would move out in Bihar villages and stay with the masses to find out the reason of the people shifting their loyalty from his party.        
	I have been the man for the masses. I will remain with them, the RJD chief said.         
	LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan greeted Lalu with a box of ladoos.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Patna, Aug. 27: A day after the Prime Minister advised chief ministers to catch the big fish, Nitish Kumar today asked Manmohan Singh to ensure the Centres nod to the Bihar bill that seeks a crackdown on public servants.         
	The Prime Minister must intervene to ensure the clearance of the bill that has already been passed by two houses of the state legislature, said Nitish Kumar, adding: There are provisions in the bill to launch a crackdown on public servants in an effective manner.         
	He said that the bill empowers investigating agencies to confiscate properties of high-profile public servant, if it is beyond known sources of income. It would be effective only when the Centre gives its nod.         
	Yesterday, Prime Minister asked the CBI and other central vigilance agencies to ensure that the popular notion of big fishes let to escape must be eradicated.         
	Meanwhile, Nitish Kumar also expressed his satisfaction by the Union cabinets decision that vested 50 per cent quota to women in local bodies. Bihar is one of the first states that reserved 50 per cent seats for women in panchayat and other bodies, said Nitish.         
	He added that he had raised the issue of approval (bill) at a meeting with Union law minister Veerappa Moily.         
	He added that his state has been a front-runner in carrying out speedy justice in long-pending cases of offence.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bihar ready for final lap
                                                                                                               Bihar ready for final lap
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, May 6: To maintain the lull in Bihars otherwise violent poll record, the government has taken strict measures for the final phase tomorrow when three of the 40 Lok Sabha seats go to the polls.         
	Tomorrows battle will see RJD chief Lalu Prasad and actors Shatrughan Sinha and Shekhar Suman battle it out for Patna Saheb and Patliputra seats. Bihar that has been infamous for large-scale poll violence in the past has so far witnessed fewer cases in the first two phases this year. Seven persons died in stray incidents of violence and blasts on April 16 and April 23.        
	As many as 76 people died in the state during the 1999 Lok Sabha polls, while during the 2000 Assembly election 61 lives were lost, which included several security personnel.        
	However, there was a brief respite from the bloody polls in 2004 general election with the Election Commission deploying K.J. Rao as a special observer. Rao, much to the chagrin of don-cum-politicians monitored the deployment of security personnel himself. Despite strict measures, the state recorded 19 deaths during the 2004 Lok Sabha polls and 27 during the 2005 Assembly polls.         
	But, the Nitish Kumar government that came into power in 2005, tackled the matter right from the start. The chief minister arrested gangsters-turned-politicians, sending several men of clout behind bars. His government introduced speedy trials and ensured conviction to several, including Md Shahabuddin, Sunil Pandey, Surajbhan and Pappu Yadav, barring them from joining the poll fray.         
	Experts believe that effective policing and judicial intervention played a large role in containing poll-related violence in the state.        
	This time the baton-wielding Home Guards would be mostly missing from action. For the final phase, poll administration has so far deployed 218 zonal magistrates for Pataliputra and Patna Saheb seats. Poll staff have been asked to ensure deployment of armed paramilitary forces in and around all polling stations-sensitive or otherwise.         
	On the eve of poll, Patna resembled a police camp with streets packed with personnel and shops and business establishments closed. The administration also sealed off all liquor shops after 5pm yesterday. A three-tier security arrangement has been made for tomorrows phase. Personnel would be keeping a hawks eye on air, water and land for possible trouble. Inspector-general of police (Patna) J.S. Gangwar said his men will conduct air surveillance over Patna Saheb, Pataliputra and Nalanda through Indian Air Force choppers. Patrolling would be conducted through motorboats on the Ganga.        
	The final phase will decide the fate of Lalu Prasad locked in a straight contest with JD(U) nominee, Ranjan Yadav, in Pataliputra. Actor Shatrughan Sinha is locked in a triangular contest with Shekhar Sunman (Congress) and Vijay Kumar Sahu (RJD). In Nalanda  Nitish Kumars home  the chief minister has fielded a political rookie, Kaushilendra Kumar, against LJPs Satish Kumar and Congresss Ram Swaroop Ram.

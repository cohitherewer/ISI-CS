The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tribal call to close cop camps
                                                                                                               Tribal call to close cop camps
          PRONAB MONDAL                              
	Lalgarh, Feb. 5: Tribal leaders today decided to launch a movement for the removal of two police camps here for doing nothing to protect the people.        
	One camp, in Ramgarh, houses 120 CRPF personnel and the other, in Kalaimuri, 80 Indian Reserve Battalion personnel.        
	Chhatradhar Mahato, the leader of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, said the decision was taken because of the total inaction of the police while our people were being killed by CPM goons.        
	Three innocent tribals have been shot in front of the police, Mahato said. Instead of arresting the culprits, the police provided them safe passage. So we do not trust the police, nor can we hope they will ensure our protection. There is a nexus between the police and the CPM.

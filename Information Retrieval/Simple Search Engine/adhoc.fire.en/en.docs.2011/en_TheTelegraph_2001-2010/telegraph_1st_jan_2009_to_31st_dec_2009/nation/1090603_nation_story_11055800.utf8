The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitish to talk status with PM again
                                                                                                               Nitish to talk status with PM again
                            
	Patna, June 2 (PTI): Brushing aside Union rural development minister C.P. Joshis reported statement against his demand for securing a special category status for Bihar, chief minister Nitish Kumar today said he would seek an appointment with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to press for the demand.        
	Perhaps Joshi is not aware of the issue. The Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution and forwarded it to the Centre on April 4, 2006, to accord a special state category to Bihar, Nitish said.        
	The state later approached Prime Minister to allo an all-party delegation from Bihar to meet him on April 13, 2006, he said.        
	Asserting that Bihar deserved the status given its economic and infrastructure situation, Nitish said he would again request Manmohan Singh to give an opportunity to party representatives to revive Bihars case.        
	He also demanded that Centre-sponsored schemes be pruned, arguing that the state suffered trying to match Centres grants. He was referring to the issue that has been already discussed at a meeting of the national development council in 2001.        
	While talking to reporters today, the chief minister also expressed happiness over JD(U)s victory at Fatuha. Nitish pointed out that the victory was a mark of peoples faith in development and hailed it as a stamp of approval for the work done for Mahadalit community. The JD(U) winner from Fatuha, Arun Manjhi, belongs to the community.        
	Nitish slammed yesterdays violence in which a Bihar train was torched. He accused former railway minister Lalu Prasad of introducing passenger halts without sanction. By creating halts without ensuring permission from the railway board, Laluji put the present railway minister in a spot, he said.        
	In response, Lalu Prasad flayed chief minister for the violence at Khusrupur where thousands torched six compartments of a train and a railway station. Lalu blamed Nitish for being unable to handle the (law and order) matter deftly, and said: Nitish should have been cautious. Its the responsibility of the states railway police to take care of such things (attack on trains).

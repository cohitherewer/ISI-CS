The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sonia sweetener for Shivraj sugar drive
                                                                                                               Sonia sweetener for Shivraj sugar drive
          RASHEED KIDWAI      
	Bhopal, Aug. 24: Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan has found an unlikely admirer in Sonia Gandhi.        
	The Congress president reportedly had a word of praise for Chauhan for his drive against hoarders of sugar and other essential commodities.         
	Sonia is said to have made the remark at last weeks meeting of the Congress Working Committee and hoped that states ruled by her party would follow suit. The praise for Chauhan comes at a time when the BJP is struggling to find a successor to the ageing L.K. Advani.         
	At 51, Chauhan, an unassuming leader who led the BJP to victory in November 2008, is emerging as a dark horse in the galaxy of more illustrious leaders such as Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley, Rajnath Singh, Narendra Modi, B.S. Yeddyurappa and Raman Singh.        
	A section within the Madhya Pradesh BJP feels that Chauhan has a promising future because of his background in the Hindi heartland, oratory skills and thrust on development. He was also among the first BJP chief ministers to rule out a ban on Jaswant Singhs book Jinnah: India, Partition, Independence.        
	But the Madhya Pradesh chief minister is perceived to be a disciplined party soldier. During the 2009 parliamentary polls, Advani, the partys then prime ministerial candidate, had almost made it a habit of mentioning Chauhan in the same breath as Modi.         
	The praise from the Congress chief has encouraged Chauhan, who is now mulling over the idea of starting a help-line for people to complain against hoarders.         
	The Chauhan administration has seized more than 45,000 quintals of sugar in raids at 425 spots so far. The chief minister is hopeful that the crackdown would help bring down the retail price of sugar by almost Rs 3 a kg. Chauhan sounded a tad sheepish when asked to comment on the praise from Sonia. What can I say, he said. It is a sign of healthy politics.        
	The chief minister said the crackdown would continue. It will help ease panic among people who were buying sugar in advance, he said.         
	 Traders shouldnt earn more than 2 per cent profit, Chauhan added.

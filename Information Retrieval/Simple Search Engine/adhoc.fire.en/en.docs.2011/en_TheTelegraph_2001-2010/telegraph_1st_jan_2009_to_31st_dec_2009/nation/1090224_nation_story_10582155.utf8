The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Look Ma, we heard it and saw it in the 70s 
                                                                                                               Look Ma, we heard it and saw it in the 70s 
          PRATIM D. GUPTA                        Rahman says mere paas maa hai at Kodak Theatre; (below) a poster of Deewar, the film from which he borrowed the line				                                       
	Calcutta, Feb. 23: When A.R. Rahman said mere paas maa hai in his Oscar acceptance speech, he was referring to his mother Kareema Begum, who was seated among the audience at the Kodak Theatre.         
	However, the iconic dialogue from Deewaar also summed up the many narrative and visual references that Danny Boyles Slumdog Millionaire  knowingly or unknowingly  makes to the popular Bollywood movies of the 1970s.        
	One of the handful of detractors of the film that won eight Oscars on Sunday night, director Priyadarshan, had said: Slumdog Millionaire is nothing but a cheap trashy mediocre version of those commercial films about estranged brothers and childhood sweethearts that Salim-Javed used to write so brilliantly in the 1970s. If the Golden Globe and Oscars committees have chosen to honour this trashy film, it just shows their ignorance of world cinema.        
	Whether Slumdog is cheap, trashy and mediocre, is up for debate, but it certainly has elements in its plotting and style that owe their origin to some of the biggest Bollywood blockbusters of an era gone by. Not only those written by Salim Khan and Javed Akhtar but also those helmed by Nasir Hussain and Manmohan Desai.        
	In fact, Deewaar pops up in a big way in the scene where the elder Jamal meets the elder Salim for the first time. They meet at a construction site and then in true Amitabh-Shashi style, start discussing how they have grown up in the slums in extreme poverty and how they stand today. Madhur Mittals repeated use of the bhai word makes the analogy even more in your face.        
	Going back, the Slumdog kids running on train tops and suddenly jumping a few years is pure Bollywood. How many movies have we seen where our Hindi film hero is running and the close-up of his legs dissolves into his elder self?         
	From Yaadon Ki Baaraat to Shakti, its one of the most recurring images in our films, the most dramatic way for the story to time-travel.         
	Hollywood has always preferred the more sedate 10 years later subtitle to skip the interim years.        
	Then you have the childhood romance between Jamal and Latika, how they want to break the shackles and lead a luxurious life together some day.         
	The entire basis of the love story in Hum Kisi Se Kum Naheen is rooted to their childhood romance  how Sanjay and Kajal promise to be with each other when they grow up.         
	Slumdogs showing of street children being picked up and turned into professional beggars shocked many. But 35 years ago, Javed Akhtar had written similar scenes in the Randhir Kapoor-Vinod Khanna film Haath Ki Safai, where Satyen Kappu played the Fagin teaching the kids to beg and steal.         
	Madhur Bhandarkar claimed that Slumdog reminded him of his own Traffic Signal, but we do remember Haath Ki Safai.        
	And, of course, there is the depiction of India as a melting point of all kinds of religion.         
	Jamal Malik was called Ram Mohammed Thomas in the original book. While scriptwriter Simon Beaufoy dilutes that aspect, he does bring in the religious element vividly in the Ram-and-riots sequence. A touch of Amar Akbar Anthony, is it?        
	Well, by no means is Slumdog a copy-paste job of any kind but it does create a sense of dj vu for anybody whos seen Bollywood of the 70s.

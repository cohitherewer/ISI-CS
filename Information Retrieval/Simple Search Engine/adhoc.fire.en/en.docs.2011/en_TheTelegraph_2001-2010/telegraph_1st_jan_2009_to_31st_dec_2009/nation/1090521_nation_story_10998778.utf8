The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Somnath denies nuke deal nudge
                                                                                                               Somnath denies nuke deal nudge
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               Chatterjee, Amar				                                 
	New Delhi, May 20: Somnath Chatterjee today denied Amar Singhs claim that he had urged the Samajwadi Party as Speaker to back the UPA on the nuclear deal.        
	Taken aback by Amars remarks earlier in the day, Chatterjee put out a statement this evening expressing anguish over the fact that his name was being dragged into needless controversy.        
	The denial also assumes significance since it comes a day after Chatterjee, expelled from the CPM for not toeing the party line, said not withdrawing support would have made a heaven-and-hell difference to the partys fortunes in the polls.        
	I am constrained to say that the statement of my good friend (Amar) is without any basis or foundation. I have never made any observation about the merits or otherwise of the nuclear deal. It is regretted that the (former) Speaker has been dragged into a needless controversy, he said.        
	Amar had said Somnathda asked me to support the deal for the sake of national interest. Somnathda asked us to support the UPA by forgetting all the acrimony. Before we supported the Congress-led coalition, for four-and-a-half years there were bitter relations between the SP and the Congress.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pak just a piece of land: Rahul
                                                                                                               Pak just a piece of land: Rahul
                          Rahul Gandhi in Shimla on Tuesday. Rahul described Pakistan as just ldquo;a small piece of land rdquo; that didn rsquo;t deserve even ldquo;half the importance rdquo; India gives it.
  ldquo;We are giving too much importance to Pakistan. It is just a small piece of land. India can rsquo;t be compared with Pakistan, rdquo; Rahul said. (PTI picture) 
                    
	Rahul Gandhi will reach Jharkhand on Wednesday for a two-day tour that includes visits to regions worst hit by the Maoist menace, as the Congress leader tries to get a first-hand feel of problem areas.        
	Party sources said the young MPs trip, close on the heels of the beheading of a state police inspector by the rebels, had stirred up a lot of interest as he would focus on meeting tribal boys and girls.        
	Although Rahul will stay the night in Ranchi, he will tour Chatra and Daltongunj, two of Maoist-infested Jharkhands worst rebel-hit districts that even police patrols avoid after dusk.        
	Congress sources said Rahul was particularly interested in visiting Naxalite-affected areas as restricting his tour to urban centres like Ranchi wouldnt be in tune with his lament about political parties not reaching out to people in remote areas.        
	Leaders close to Rahul said he was determined to get a first-hand feel of the whole country, especially the problem areas, and interact with the common people to understand their lives.        
	Rahul will attend two conventions, one each of Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Castes in Sahibganj and Chatra, where he will interact with the delegates without the presence of the media. The sources said Rahul was expected to ask the tribals what they felt was the reason for the spread of the Maoist menace.        
	He will also attend a convention of young women in Hazaribagh where he will motivate them to take up social and political work.

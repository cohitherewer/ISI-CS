          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mukherjee in Delhi on Friday. (Prem Singh)                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 11: Sharad Pawar neednt spend sleepless nights over how fat persons can be squeezed into the middle seat of a planes economy class and Farooq Abdullah about tall men being similarly crammed.         
	Pranab Mukherjee today clarified his diktats were applicable only to Congress ministers and MPs and not to those of allies like Pawar and Abdullah, a day after UPA ministers carped about the finance ministrys fresh austerity measures banning first-class air travel, foreign junkets and entertainment in five-star hotels.         
	It is up to the other political parties to decide (what they wish to do). It is a coalition government and our decisions are in respect to the Congress ministers and MPs, said Mukherjee.        
	These austerity measures are not new, they were there. But when our position was comfortable, when the growth rate was high, they were not strictly adhered to.         
	Mukherjee said the only two measures he had introduced were that Congress ministers and MPs and certain officials (he did not elaborate on who they were) should travel economy class on domestic flights and business class (not first class) on international flights.         
	He said conferences and seminars should not be hosted in hotels because the capital had several government facilities for such events. But there was no taboo on hosting lunches and dinners in hotels.

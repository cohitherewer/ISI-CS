The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lonely Lalu talks of forgiveness
                                                                                                               Lonely Lalu talks of forgiveness
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, Sept. 1: Known for his diatribe against rivals, Lalu Prasad has of late turned philosophical while talking of them, a wonder since the by-elections to the 18 state Assembly constituencies is right around the corner.        
	Leading a campaign for RJD and LJP candidates, the former railway minister did not turn acerbic as he talked of leaders who had recently deserted him, or about his rivals.         
	It is the holy month of Ramzan. Allah will take care of Taslim saheb, was Lalus opinion about former RJD leader Taslimuddins move to desert his party before the polls. The RJD chief also quoted Rahims couplet: Rahiman aah garib ka kabhi na nisphal jai (a poor mans suffering never goes in vain).         
	The RJD chief obviously views himself as the poor man in the wake of senior leaders deserting him.         
	Those who want to leave me can do so. I am not going to stop anyone, but I will never forget it either, he shoots a warning.        
	Lalus most trusted man Shyam Razak recently joined Nitish Kumars JD(U). The poor mans suffering is understandable since the RJD boss handpicked Razak and gave him a political identity to the extent of making him a minister in his cabinet. Ironically, his former protg is contesting against the RJD in Phulwarisharief.         
	I can only pray that he (Razak) does well. But, should one forget ones parents who is responsible for ones existence in the first place?        
	Lalu Prasad, known for his attacks on L.K. Advani, who he even got arrested in the Nineties, is also refusing to comment on the BJP leaders predicament.         
	Advaniji is in pain now and I am not a man who attacks his political rivals when they are in pain. I do not enjoy my rivals fall.        
	He is even willing to forgive Samajvadi Party that fought the 2009 Lok Sabha polls in alliance with Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan for fielding its candidate against LJP-RJD on Phulwarisharief. Let SP field its candidate. The RJD will not field its candidates against Mulayam Singh Yadavs party in Uttar Pradesh. I cannot stop SP or any party from contesting polls.        
	During his interview Lalu also refrained from directly attacking Nitish Kumar.         
	I have always referred to Nitishji as my chhota Bhai. I have nothing personal against him. Of course, we are political rivals and it is for the people to chose between his party and mine.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Murder slap in Congs Dalit face
                                                                                                               Murder slap in Congs Dalit face
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Prasad: Resignation ruled out                                  
	Lucknow, Feb. 11: The Congress suffered a blow today when a criminal case was filed against Union minister Mahavir Prasad, the partys most recognisable Dalit face in Uttar Pradesh.         
	Prasad, the minister for small scale, agro and rural industries, has been accused of being part of a conspiracy to murder a resident of his village in Gorakhpur.        
	I will face the trial but not resign from my post as a minister, the Bansgaon MP said, alleging he had been framed.         
	The case against him was filed on the orders of Allahabad High Court.         
	Subhavati Devi, a resident of Ujjarpar in Gorakhpur, moved a local court last week alleging that the minister was involved in a conspiracy to kill her husband Ram Pargat, a farmer and BSP worker. When the court refused to entertain the petition, she moved the high court.        
	Ram Pargat, who was in his thirties, was found dead by the road on the evening of January 28 with head injuries. On January 29, police registered an accident case, saying the farmer had been knocked down by a car.        
	However, some local residents said he might have been hit by a blunt weapon on his head and asked the widow to move court.         
	It is our task now to find out the truth behind the case and, in the next few days, conclude if it is a case of murder or accident, Gorakhpur special superintendent of police Aditya Mishra said.        
	Mishra said two other accused  village head Rajesh Singh and resident Gauri Shankar, both close to the minister  had been charged with murder, destroying evidence, intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of public peace, criminal intimidation and the SC/ST act.        
	Brij Lal, the additional director general of police, said the probe would be fair.         
	However, the Congress legislature party leader in Uttar Pradesh, Pramod Tiwari, is already crying foul. It is part of a conspiracy by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati to defame Dalit leaders of the Congress. We have been facing this since long. But we will fight it politically, he said.         
	The case against Prasad is a blow to the Congresss efforts to woo Dalits in Uttar Pradesh ahead of the general election. Amethi MP Rahul Gandhi has been trying to reach out to Dalits over the past many months. His night stops at homes of Dalits in the state had rattled BSP chief minister Mayavati, who sees the community as her captive vote bank.         
	State Congress chief Rita Bahuguna Joshi refused to comment. It is not appropriate to come to any conclusion before seeing the order, she said.

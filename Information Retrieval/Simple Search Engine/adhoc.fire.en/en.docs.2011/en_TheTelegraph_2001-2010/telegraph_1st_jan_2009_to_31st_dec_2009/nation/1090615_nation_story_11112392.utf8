The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sibal dose for cheat colleges 
                                                                                                               Sibal dose for cheat colleges 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                          Sibal: More teeth                                  
	New Delhi, June 14: The human resource development ministry is arming itself with legal teeth to punish educational institutions that use misleading or false claims to lure students.        
	The options being weighed range from amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code making misleading claims a crime to instituting a panel with powers to order legal punishment, sources said.        
	Education authorities now lack legal provisions to punish recognised institutions that make false or misleading claims to attract students, and so these institutions can easily ignore government objections to their advertisements or prospectus.        
	The new HRD minister, Kapil Sibal, met senior officials on June 6 to discuss the suggested options to punish these institutions, The Telegraph has learnt. The government is weighing the strengths and weaknesses of each option.        
	Sibal is known to favour increased private investment in education but is also anxious to have strict regulations to prevent institutions mushrooming with the sole aim of profiteering, the sources said.        
	Officials say there have been complaints that educational institutions are making claims in advertisements that are either false or deliberately misleading.        
	This is an issue that is certainly bothering the minister. We are yet to decide the exact nature of the regulatory mechanism, but the ministers keenness suggests that some mechanism will come up, a source said.        
	As an example of a false claim, the officials cited a private institution that says in advertisements that it is the countrys largest university. In reality, it is merely a deemed university  a set of controversial institutions now under review  and the student strength it claims is less than a fourth of Delhi Universitys.        
	For misleading claims, the officials cited an institution that claimed to be Indias No. 1-ranked private university without mentioning who conducted the ranking and what criteria they used.        
	A fake university  an institution running without required recognition  can be fined under the UGC Act, but the fine cannot be more than Rs 1,000 for each guilty administrator at the accused institution.        
	The University Grants Commission (UGC) and the HRD ministry can de-recognise or stop grants to recognised institutions that fail to fulfil their obligations under the UGC Act.        
	But the UGC Act and the rules accompanying it do not empower the commission, ministry or any other government agency to act against recognised institutions that make false or misleading claims.        
	Amid the increasing complaints against such institutions, especially in the past two years, all the ministry has done is repeatedly issue impotent notices to them to explain their actions.        
	Our notices are impotent and sent more in desperation than in any realistic expectation that changes (in institutions advertisements and prospectus) will take place, a senior official said.        
	The institutions invariably escape censure  some do not even reply to the notices, the official said.        
	In the absence of clinching evidence of false or misleading claims, institutions escape punishment even when parents or students appeal to the courts citing the laws against cheating, a senior UGC official said.

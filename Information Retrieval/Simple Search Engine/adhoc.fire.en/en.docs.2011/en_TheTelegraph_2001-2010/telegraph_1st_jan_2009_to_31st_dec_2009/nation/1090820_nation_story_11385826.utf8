The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | We need non-lethal defence supplies from India
                                                                                                               We need non-lethal defence supplies from India
										                              Madhav Kumar Nepal on Wednesday				                           
	As if he were not beleaguered enough by the intransigent Maoists, Nepali Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal arrived in New Delhi yesterday battling a fresh eruption back home, this time within his own shaky coalition. Foreign minister Sujata Koirala threw a political fit on the eve of his departure from Kathmandu, demanding to be made deputy Prime Minister. Madhav Kumar Nepal was not in obliging mood; Koirala chose to embarrass the Prime Minister by refusing to join the official delegation to India.         
	Madhav Kumar Nepal chose to make light of Koiralas tantrum  I think she suddenly took ill, and she has a right to fall ill  but the complex political crisis he faces back home is nothing he can brush off with wit.         
	The Maoists, the single largest party in the Constituent Assembly elected last year, have kept the peace process deadlocked since Prachanda resigned in May. The drafting of the new constitution is running way behind schedule and it is likely it will not be completed before the May 2010 deadline.         
	Maoist hardliners and Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) cadres are increasingly restive at having been sidelined from the government even though they have the biggest mandate. There are tensions between the Nepalese Army and the PLA over the latters integration, tensions that have impacted the political process itself. On top of it all, Prime Minister Nepals own credibility is under question because he lost both seats he contested in last years election. His plate is brimming over with trouble. In New Delhi on a four-day official visit, Madhav Kumar Nepal spoke to Sankarshan Thakur at his hotel suite on some of these issues shortly before commencing official talks with Indian leaders. Excerpts:               
	Q: Prime Minister, youve come to India at a time when a huge credibility question looms on your government. The Constituent Assembly (CA) is deadlocked; the largest party, the Maoists, is not co-operating. They have, in fact, called upon New Delhi to stop dealing with you. Whats your sense of how deep the crisis is in Nepal is?         
	A: The issue is simple. The Maoists want to rule Nepal any which way, they will not let anyone else function, that is what their politics is. The crisis is not with me or with my alliance, the crisis is what the Maoists have created because of their selfish and totalitarian brand of politics.               
	Q: But they call you undemocratic. Baburam Bhattarai told me a month ago that since you had lost the election, any government led by you was undemocratic.         
	A: How do you expect me to respond to that? Maoists are bound to say such things. Am I to seek certificates from them? The fact is that mine is a government elected unanimously by the CA, the Maoists boycotted the session, but that was their decision. I am constitutionally elected, I command a majority, the Maoists are less than one-third of the CA, how can they make such claims? It is just their frustration. They made a big noise about winning the last election, where did they win? They have 29 per cent of the popular vote, which means 71 per cent Nepalis are still against them.               
	Q: But in a first-past-the-post system, it is the number of seats that should decide.         
	A: True, but they still did not win the election, they have less than one-third seats, and they are not the sole representatives of Nepali public opinion. My alliance has 22 parties, all of which came through elections, and they are not with the Maoists. Should that carry some weight too or no?         
	Q: The fact still is, Prime Minister, that without the Maoists co-operation, the peace process cannot proceed, the new Constitution cannot be written by the May 2010 deadline.         
	A: There are difficulties, yes, there is a concern that we may not be able to complete the task of finalising a new Constitution in time. But it is for the Maoists to co-operate and help us on that, they are the ones creating the deadlock.               
	Q: But they say your government is undemocratic and reactionary, and also that it has been propped up by India.         
	A: (Laughs sardonically) Who are they to say that? The Maoists can keep quibbling and complaining. Who says my government is propped up by India? It is a democratic government elected on the floor of parliament. Do you become democratic only if you have the blessings of Maoists? This is what needs to be exposed and condemned about the Maoists. They are intrinsically and ideologically not democratic, they are basically authoritarian, that is their mindset. Any government that they do not dominate becomes undemocratic. This tendency needs to be combated politically and ideologically, their real undemocratic nature needs to be brought out. They want power somehow and if they dont have it, they want only to disrupt.               
	Q: Are you saying the Nepali Maoists are not committed to multi-party democracy?         
	A: Well, there is a huge question mark on their commitment. I do not know if they respect democracy, I do not know if they respect the rule of law. They only want to establish their authority. They want a one-party dictatorship in Nepal, which is not acceptable to the people. They do not want supremacy of the people, they want supremacy of the Maoist party.         
	Q: How do you intend to deal with that? After all, you will have to engage the Maoists in some way in order the take the peace process forward.         
	A: We have been trying. One way is for them to join my government, then they can have a say in governance as well as work for the finalisation of the new Constitution. But are they prepared? You will have to ask the Maoists that, from my side the invitation exists for them to join and begin co-operating.               
	Q: Do you think Nepal is drifting towards a deeper domestic crisis because of the current deadlock?         
	A: We have to avoid that situation. And my government is doing all it can to avoid it, but the Maoists have to co-operate, that is the logic of the electoral verdict and of having a Constituent Assembly, we have to take the peace process forward together.               
	Q: One sticking point with them is the integration and rehabilitation of the PLA. Whats happening with that?         
	A: We have to look into that, we have agreed to certain methods.               
	Q: But whats happening? There are many views. That integration means integration into society, or into the army, or even the police forces? Maoists even fear that there is a bid to slowly disband their armed cadres (currently restricted to barracks under UN supervision). What is your view on what it means?         
	A: You know there is a Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) and these issues have been dealt with there. Whatever is done will be done in consonance with the provisions of the CPA. But that is a later issue, first we have to sort out the current impasse and bring the Maoists back into participating actively in the peace process.         
	Q: A linked issue is arms supplies for the Nepali Army from India. The Maoists say any move in that direction will be a violation of your domestic agreements. At the same time, there are reports that your army is starved of ammunition, there isnt enough even for training purposes.         
	A: That is true, and there is a ban on importing lethal weapons. But there is no restriction on the import of non-lethal defence supplies, and there is no restriction on getting supplies for the police forces.               
	Q: So are you looking for such supplies from India?         
	A: Yes we are, India has always been understanding of our needs, and the matter will come up in our talks because there are supplies that we urgently require.               
	Q: What else are priority issues on this visit?         
	A: This is more a goodwill visit, but we hope to have useful talks, especially on matters related to trade, taxation and commerce.               
	Q: The issue of reviewing the Indo-Nepal treaty?         
	A: That is on the agenda, too, but there are no big issues there, we might want a few changes here and there but nothing radical and nothing that should worry anybody.               
	Q: The Maoists have been saying you should not sign any major agreements, especially those related to arms and land.         
	A: I would not like to comment on what they say. What I can say is that we want good and improved ties with India. And to those who fear Nepal is leaning towards China or India, I have to say that we want good and fruitful relations with all our neighbours, it is in the interest of the region and especially in the interest of Nepal. And that is what I want to achieve.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Aug. 9: The Naveen Patnaik government is in the dock for having failed to collect royalty arrears worth Rs 11 crore outstanding for more than three years now, against Bhusan Steel and Strips which is coming up with a 3MT steel plant at Meramundali near Dhenkanal.         
	Responding to a petition, Orissa High Court has asked the state to explain the pending revenue arrears.        
	Dhenkanal (Sadar)s NCP MLA Nabin Nanda sought judicial intervention into the matter through a PIL. The legislator accused the state of failing to collect royalty due to administrative inertia vis--vis non-co-operation by the company. Bhusan Steel had used sand raised from the land leased out by Infrastructure Development Corporation (Idco) for the steel project at Meramundali.         
	Tehsildars of Dhenkanal and Hindol had sent demand notices to the company on May 19, 2006, under Orissa Minor Minerals Concession (OMMC) Rules-2004 for depositing royalty on the use of earth, morrum and sand. The levy was pegged at Rs 11.01 crores. But the revenue officials had failed to collect the revenue till date, Nanda pointed out.        
	Acting on the petition, a two-judge bench of acting Chief Justice I.M. Quddusi and Justice Sanju Panda had issued notices to the state and Dhenkanal administration last week. Notices were also issued to Bhusan Steel and Strips. The court gave the respondents four weeks time to file their responses.

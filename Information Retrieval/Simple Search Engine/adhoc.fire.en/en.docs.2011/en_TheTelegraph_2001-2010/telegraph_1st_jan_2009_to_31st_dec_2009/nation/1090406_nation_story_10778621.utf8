	Patna, April 5: The Congress, contesting all Bihar seats after its split with the RJD-LJP alliance, may not be the pollsters favourite, but Rahul Gandhi is sure the hero in Madhepura.         
	At least that is what Ranjita, 34, a sitting MP from Saharsa and her husband, a sitting MP from Madhepura, believe. They say the flood-ravaged constituency feels strongly about the Gandhi scion who travelled on a boat to reach out to the marooned people after the Kosi floods.         
	For this, she spurned an LJP ticket from Supaul  that was underwater in the wake of the Kosi breach in August 2008  to join the Congress that allotted its ticket to the former state-level badminton player.         
	The articulate wife of Purneas don is a Sikh woman who has earned the Congresss loyalty after delivering a fiery speech in favour of the Manmohan Singh-sponsored confidence motion in the Lok Sabha.         
	The influential couple has developed a fondness for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Soon after coming out on bail, Pappu, who stands convicted for the murder of CPM leader Ajit Sarkar, requested Manmohan Singh to contest from any constituency in the Kosi belt. Manmohan Singh is the most honest leader in the world today. Therefore, I would like him to contest from any seat in the Kosi belt, Pappu Yadav said.         
	In fact, the Prime Minister travelled to the area when the worst-ever flood marooned millions last year and declared the flood a national calamity. He also allocated Rs 1,000 crore for relief.         
	I have decided to Contest on a Congress ticket after consulting my constituencies people who fondly and vividly remember how the Prime Minister came with relief to them and how Rahulji (Gandhi) also came with relief, Ranjita said.         
	The politician had won the Saharsa Lok Sabha seat on a LJP ticket, while husband Pappu Yadav had won from Madhepura on an RJD ticket in 2004 polls. Saharsa seat lost its existence in the delimitation process and Ranjita shifted to nearby Supaul.         
	Ranjita, Pappu and supporters believe that displaced people are angry with the state NDA government that failed to maintain the embankment.         
	I am confident that the Congress, with a young leader like Rahulji and an able leader like Manmohan Singh at the helm, is the right party for this country and generation, Ranjita added.        
	Her decision has dealt a big blow to the RJD-LJP combination that fielded her from Supaul as their joint candidate. It is not yet known what Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan will do. Lalu Prasads brother-in-law, Sadhu Yadav, too, migrated to Congress and is now locked in a poll battle with LJP nominee Prakash Jha in West Champaran. Pappu who has won the Purnea and Madhepura seats for four times has now shifted to Congress.

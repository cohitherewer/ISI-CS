          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Srinagar, June 29: Police firing today killed two agitators in Baramulla, the Kashmir town rocked by protests over the past two days following a womans allegation of misbehaviour by some cops.        
	The situation is tense in the town, so we had to impose a curfew, Baramulla district magistrate Lateef uz Zaman Dewa said.         
	The protests started yesterday when the woman came out of a police station complaining that some personnel had sought sexual favours from her in exchange of her husbands release.         
	The police denied the charge but as news of the complaint spread, youths shouting anti-India slogans clashed with the cops in the north Kashmir town 55km from Srinagar.         
	Dewa said the couple had been detained on the charge that they had abetted the abduction of a minor girl. Her husband was involved in the abduction. But when the woman came out of the police station, she told people the police had misbehaved with her. It is strange that the people sided with the abductors, he said.         
	The police said they had received a complaint some days back about the abduction of the girl in Baramulla. A search was launched and the couple were caught. During investigations, it was found that the couple had abetted the abduction, a police officer said. The girl was found later.         
	After overnight protests in Baramulla, people took to the streets this morning and started throwing stones at the police.         
	The police and the CRPF first used tear gas to scatter the mob. When this did not help, they opened fire.         
	Ten people were injured, three of them critically. They were taken to a Srinagar hospital where Mohammad Salim and Tariq Ahmed died.        
	Despite curfew, a large number of people were on the streets today, clashing with the police.         
	District magistrate Dewa said a probe had been ordered. Additional district magistrate M.S. Shantu will investigate the matter and submit a report within 10 days, he said.         
	Todays incident in Baramulla could stoke the anger in Shopian where residents are still protesting the alleged rape and murder of two women. Local residents suspect the security forces.        
	The Hurriyat faction led by hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani today gave a three-day strike call to protest the governments alleged inability to nail the culprits responsible for the crime and also to protest the death of the Baramulla youths.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Twin factory trump for Lalu

          NALIN VERMA                          Smooth operator                                  
	Patna, Feb 5: By getting the Union cabinet nod to two railway factories at Marhaura (Chapra) and Madhepura today, Lalu Prasad has earned brownie points over his electorate before the Lok Sabha polls.        
	Union home minister P. Chidambaram announced the setting up of a diesel locomotive factory at Marhaura and an electric locomotive factory at Madhepura while announcing other pre-poll gifts for states such as Maharastra, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Punjab.         
	The RJD boss had won Chapra and Madhepura Lok Sabha seats in 2004 polls by defeating JD(U)s Sharad Yadav in Madhepura and BJP spokesman Rajiv Pratap Rudi in Chapra. Later, he retained Chapra, sparing Madhepura for Pappu Yadav to win from behind the bars at the by-election that followed.         
	There is no need to read political motive behind the two factories as the railway minister had earlier tried to gift his state with similar projects. Laluji had announced the setting up of the two factories much before the Assembly polls came into picture, said the party spokesman, Shyam Razak.         
	Fact remains that Lalu Prasad got the Union cabinet to agree to change the projects character before the model code of conduct was put in place. The projects will be executed through public private partnership that will enable the railways to involve industrial houses and the people of their choice in getting the projects in place.        
	RJD sources revealed that Lalu Prasad may try to contest two Lok Sabha seats  Chapra and Pataliputra  leaving Rajesh Ranjan, alias Pappu Yadav, to take on Sharad Yadav in Madhepura. But, he will hardly like the JD(U) to wrest the Yadav-dominated Madhpura seat from the RJD.        
	Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has been facing peoples anger in Madhepura, Saharsa and three other districts on the Indo-Nepalese border that suffered from unprecedented floods in 2008. The Nitish government has tried its best to neutralise peoples anger by plugging the breach in the Kosi embankment at Kusaha that caused the havoc.         
	However, Lalu Prasad has tried to appease his constituents by giving something bigger when the people have got their homes and belongings swept away. The people of Kosi region comprising Madhepura, Supaul, Purnea, Araria and Katihar will never pardon Nitish government for its lapses, said Lalu Prasad.

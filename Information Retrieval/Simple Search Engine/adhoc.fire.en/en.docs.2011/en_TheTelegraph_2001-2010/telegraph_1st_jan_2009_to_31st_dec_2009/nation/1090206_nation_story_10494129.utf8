          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 5: Minority leaders have asked the government to grant legal sanctity to Indias minority education monitor to guard it from a future political dispensation that might want to neglect the watchdog.         
	Both Muslim and Christian leaders today asked human resource development minister Arjun Singh to make the National Monitoring Committee for Minorities Education a statutory body, ministry sources said.         
	It had been created to monitor the implementation of minority education programmes under the National Education Policy of 1986. But the committee was disbanded in 1994 and was only resurrected in 2004 after the Congress-led UPA came to power.         
	The minority leaders expressed concerns that a future dispensation unfriendly to their interests in New Delhi may disband the committee, which is the national watchdog for minority education, a top HRD ministry official said.         
	Minister Arjun Singh has asked his officials to draft a law to transform the committee into a statutory body. The government may, however, not have adequate time to introduce a bill for the new body in the brief session of Parliament starting on February 12.         
	Speaking to reporters after the monitoring bodys annual meet here, Singh said he hoped the right to education bill would be passed in the coming session of Parliament.         
	The bill, which makes free and compulsory education for every child between 6 and 14 a legally enforceable right, was introduced in the Rajya Sabha in December. It is yet to be cleared by either House.        
	Singh said a committee under school education secretary Anshu Vaish was examining a proposal made by Christian educational institutions to extend the midday meal to unaided schools, especially in tribal areas.         
	He also confirmed the ministrys plan to set up a national textbook council to scan non-government school textbooks.

          SUBRAT DAS                           A rescue drill at Paradip on Sunday. (Sanjib Mukherjee)                                  
	Paradip, Nov 9: The nations harrowing experience on 26/11 continues to haunt its people, as was evident from the enthusiasm with which people watched and lauded a massive naval drill carried out in the Bay of Bengal, 100km off Paradip coast, yesterday.         
	As many as seven warships participated in the drill.         
	The Indian Navy has to protect the countrys coasts at any cost, said Rear Admiral P. Murugesan, the flag officer and commander of the Eastern Fleet, while talking to reporters on board from INS Jalaswa.        
	The Indian Navy, with a fleet strength of more than 140 warships, has been assigned to co-ordinate coastal security operations across the country following the 26/11.         
	We are co-ordinating with the marine police of respective states and Indian Coast Guard to see that no more such incidents take place along the 4,700km coastline, said the Rear Admiral. The eastern coastline is as vulnerable as any other, he added.         
	The Eastern Fleet, which has more than 60 ships under its disposal, displayed its firepower as a part of the Navy Week celebrations.         
	From the INS Jalaswa, the navys first landing platform dock and an amphibious assault ship capable of transporting 1,000 combat troops, tanks and artillery vehicles, Rear Admiral Murugesan guided missile destroyers, INS Rajput and five missile corvettes  INS Kora, INS Kulish, INS Kuthar, INS INS Khanjar and INS Kirpan.         
	Missiles were fired to the mid-sea from INS Kuthar and INS Khanjar with a speed of 40km-per-hour. The colours glowed red and green as the powerful bombs detonated far out into the water.         
	The display of underway replenishment showed how resources are exchanged under-water between ships travelling in the same speed. There were also close-range anti-aircraft firing exercises and simultaneous anti-aircraft firing display.         
	A Chetak helicopter, which took off from Visakhapatnam base, conducted a mock search and rescue operation displaying how the ships are used for landing and takeoffs from the helipads of ships on move. There was a breathtaking fly-past by the Chetak helicopter and Dornier aircraft.        
	Later talking to reporters, Rear Admiral Murugesan told reporters later that the navy had plans to set up a forward operating base at Paradip to provide logistic support such as fuel, water and ration to the ships.         
	A request has been made to the government for allotting land, he added.

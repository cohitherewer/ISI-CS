	New Delhi, Jan. 9 (PTI): Two former chief justices of India have said a rethink of the judges appointment process could be considered.        
	Under the existing system, a panel of judges headed by the Chief Justice of India selects new appointees. It has been in place for over a decade but has, of late, been drawing flak as it is a closed system in which the judiciary selects its own members. Former CJI J.S. Verma, who created the collegium system, said changes could be made if required.

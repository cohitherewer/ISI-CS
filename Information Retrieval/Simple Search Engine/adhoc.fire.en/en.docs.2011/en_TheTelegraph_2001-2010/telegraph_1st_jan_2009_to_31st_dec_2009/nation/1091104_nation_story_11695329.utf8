	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 3: Expressing his concern over meagre central allocation of Rs 181.79 crore for 101 urban local bodies in Orissa, chief minister Naveen Patnaik today urged the Centre to enhance the amount to at least Rs 1,000 crore.        
	The demand was made during his meeting with the Union urban development minister, S. Jaipal Reddy, in New Delhi.        
	During discussion on various issues relating to urban development in the state, Naveen said that Orissa was forging ahead with the implementation of key urban reforms and progressing well in implementation of projects sanctioned under the Urban Infrastructure Development Scheme for Small and Medium Towns.        
	He said that only two cities in Orissa  Bhubaneswar and Puri  have been included under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) and asked for inclusion of Cuttack also under the scheme.        
	Naveen also requested for an early release of the first instalment of central share for the already sanctioned 12 drinking water supply projects and second instalment for the five ongoing road projects in Cuttack, water body restoration projects in Cuttack and Berhampur and water supply projects in Sambalpur and Koraput.        
	To showcase and promote the rich and vibrant cultural heritage of Orisss at the national level and also to contribute to the unity in diversity of India, the chief minister urged for allocation of suitable land for establishing an Orissa Centre in New Delhi.        
	The union minister assured to favourably consider the proposals, sources said.        
	Late this evening, the chief minister also met the chairman of the 13th finance commission, Vijay Kelkar, to discuss various demands of the state, including the change of central and state share of taxes.

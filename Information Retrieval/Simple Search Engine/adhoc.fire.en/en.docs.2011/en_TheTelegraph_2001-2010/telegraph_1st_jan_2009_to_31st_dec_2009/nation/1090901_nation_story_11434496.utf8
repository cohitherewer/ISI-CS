                                                                                                               Teacher beats up girl in Bihar school
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Aug. 31: A teacher allegedly beat up an 11-year-old student in class after she refused to clean school in a village in central Bihars Rohtas, 175km from here.        
	Chitra, a Class XI student, landed up at the local health centre as she fell ill after a lady teacher of Huka Government Middle School (Rohtas) beat her up, said Sunil Kumar, the victims father.        
	Sunil told The Telegraph: Chitra told her mother and me that she was beaten mercilessly by her teacher after she and her class friend refused an order to clean school toilets.        
	School headmaster Surajdeo Singh admitted that he had received a complaint from Sunil about the assault.         
	The school has no sweepers and the responsibility to keep the lavatories clean lies with the students, he said, defending the teachers actions.         
	He went on to conjecture a situation different from what the father had narrated.         
	The teacher may not have punished her for her refusal and there may be other reasons, he added.        
	However, the school management has agreed to start an investigation into the matter and would recommend suitable action against the teacher in question if she was found guilty.         
	For now, panchayat headman Nandkumar has expressed his shock over the incident describing it a serious one. The panchayat members have demanded that school authorities take action against the teacher.        
	Chitra is still undergoing treatment at the village health centre for the bruises on her back and arms. She was beaten up on Saturday.         
	But, the parents are yet to lodge a complaint with the police in this matter.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           Safe fun                                   
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 9: There will be no saffron, white or green balloons fluttering in the sky this Independence Day till the parade is over.        
	In 2006, six young men lost their sight after a minor explosion in a balloon cart of a vendor. This year, the step to ban balloons is being taken to avoid any incident similar to the mishap that occurred two years ago, said police commissioner Bijay Sharma.        
	We have banned the sale of gas balloons on Independence Day near the parade ground in the area between PMG and Master Canteen Square from 6.30am till the parade is over, he said.        
	The commissionerate has also decided to ban heavy vehicles from plying across Rajmahal Square to Ram Mandir Square crossing and on the Master Canteen Square on the same day from 7pm till the parade is over. Two-wheelers and light vehicles will only be allowed to ply till 8am.        
	Similarly, a vehicle ban would be imposed on roads from Keshari Talkies crossing towards Rabindra Mandap. Light vehicles and two-wheelers will be diverted at Keshari Talkies crossing towards the left alone, Sharma said.        
	Vehicles will also not be allowed to ply from AG Square to PMG Square. All vehicles shall be diverted at Jaydev Bhawan crossing towards IG park road. People can park their vehicles near at open spaces near Congress Bhawan, nearby lanes of Unit-3, IDCOL auditorium, Jaydev Bhawan, Reserve Bank of India and back side of Rabindra Mandap, he said.

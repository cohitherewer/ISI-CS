The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Desilt drive to save Kosi
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Desilt drive to save Kosi
          NALIN VERMA                          Villagers flee Araria during the Kosi floods last year                                  
	Patna, Nov. 30: The river Kosi, known as shok (sorrow) of Bihar, is also infamous for its heavy silt deposits, one of the worst in the world.        
	The river, which originates in Nepal, gets six inches of silt deposits every year, often leading to breaching embankments and floods.        
	At present, an exercise is underway to put the silt accumulating in the riverbed to better use. The water resources department has imported silt basin technology from the Netherlands to free the river from silt and ensure supply of silt-free water to irrigate the vast stretch of farmlands in its catchment areas and also curb recurring floods caused by the silt.        
	The technology will ensure silt-free water in the fields increasing productivity. The water, carrying heavy silt that Kosi releases, had so far been harming the soil and crops, said A.V. Nayak, the principal secretary of water resources department.        
	The government has decided to buy two dredgers and a watermaster, which has a multipurpose use, from Finland. The engineers associated with the Kosi project will use the dredgers and the watermaster to dredge out silt from the riverbed and deposit it in silt basin being created on 4km of land along the river between Kosi barrage at Bhimnagar and Kataiya.        
	An expert working on the project said: The dredgers will pump out silt from the water and with the help of watermaster the silt will be deposited in the silt basin. Thus, the river water will be free from silt while entering Bihar, as it will be desilted at the Bhimnagar barrage on India-Nepal border itself.        
	He added that excessive accumulation of silt that the water carried while passing through various mountain ranges in Nepal had been causing sharp rise in its level while entering Bihar planes.         
	The surging water level puts pressure on the embankments, leading the river to breach them and change their course, inundating a huge number of villages and towns in its journey from the Himalayas in Nepal to the Ganga near Maheskhoot in north Bihar.        
	Nayak said: The government had ordered the purchase of a dredger, which will land at the site in December. Another dredger, too, will be purchased by March next year.        
	The dredged out silt accumulated in the basin along with the river, according to the experts, can be used in checking the floods. As of now, the engineers deposit sandbags along the embankments under pressure from the surging waters. But the silt, which will turn solid in due course, will be deposited along the embankment instead of sandbags, an expert said, adding: The measure will be cheaper, cost-effective and also easy in checking floods in the Kosi belt.        
	The heavy deposit of silt was one of the prime reasons for Kosi breaching its embankment at Kusaha (Nepal) and causing unprecedented floods in Saharsa, Supaul, Madehpura, Purnea, Araria and Katihar districts last year.        
	Centre draws flak        
	Nitish Kumar today stepped up his diatribes against the Manmohan Singh government by accusing the latter of deliberately ignoring the cause of the state.         
	That the UPA government at the Centre has turned apathetic to Bihar is evident from the fact that it has been sitting on our long-pending demand of special category status to the state and flood relief package, Nitish said. He also sent letters to Singh and Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Judge smear protest
                                                                                                               Judge smear protest
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 17: Supreme Court lawyers have condemned the practice of maligning judges, weeks after former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda and the Ansals got judges to withdraw from their cases in quick succession.        
	(The) association condemns the practice of maligning the honourable judges of the apex court by politicians and others seeking exemption of hearing (before particular judges) as it goes to the root of the independence of the judiciary, the Advocates-On-Record Association said after an emergency meeting here today.        
	The stand of the association, which represents lawyers authorised to file cases in the apex court, comes a week after Gowda suggested the judge hearing his politically controversial matter may be subconsciously biased.        
	The Janata Dal (Secular) leader had filed an application asking Justice Arijit Pasayat, who had rapped him at the previous hearing, to recuse (withdraw).         
	The judge did so but not before the two-judge bench had dubbed Gowdas move unfortunate. It is up to a judge himself to decide such pleas, but the convention is to withdraw.        
	The case relates to the Rs 2,250-crore Bangalore-Mysore corridor project, which Gowda wants to stall. He had sent booklets and letters to high court judges alleging corruption by the promoter. Pasayat had rapped him for writing letters to judges and viewed such actions as an attempt to influence the judiciary.         
	The lawyers opposing Gowdas application said he wanted the judge out as he feared an adverse judgment.        
	On January 23, Justice B.N. Aggarwal had quit the Uphaar fire case after the lawyers of the halls owners, the Ansals, tried to have the matter removed from his bench.        
	Aggarwal had cancelled the bail of brothers Sushil and Gopal Ansal for their attempt to tamper with court records last September. They have been in jail since and had moved a bail plea before the judge when he opted out.        
	The families of the blaze victims had slammed the Ansals move. Lawyers, too, joined the outcry.

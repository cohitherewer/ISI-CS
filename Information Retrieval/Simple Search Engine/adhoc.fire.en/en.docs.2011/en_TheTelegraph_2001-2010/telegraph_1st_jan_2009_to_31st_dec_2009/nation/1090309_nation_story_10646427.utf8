	New Delhi, March 8 (PTI): Rajya Sabha MP Mehmood Madani had some scathing advice for Pervez Musharraf.        
	Indian Muslims are capable of solving their problems. We dont need your advice. Dont try to alienate Indian Muslims by your remarks, here or in Pakistan, Madani, the leader of the Jamaat-e-Ulema-i-Hind, said yesterday.        
	Musharraf then suggested he might take my words back.        
	Madani, speaking at the India Today Conclave, told the former Pakistan President that he or his country need not bother about the condition of Muslims in India.        
	Dont start your politics of Pakistan from here, Madani retorted when Musharraf said Muslims in India were alienated and suggested that this was one of the reasons terrorism existed in the country.        
	Madani replied: Pakistan ki jitni total population hai, us se zyada population hai Indian Muslims ki (the number of Muslims in India is higher than that total population of Pakistan). You should be knowing this.        
	When Musharraf said he was aware of this, Madani continued: If you know this, then you should also known that Indian Muslims have the capability to solve their problems.         
	He added: Seventy per cent of Indias population  a conservative estimate as it is actually 90 per cent  stands by Muslims to solve their problems.        
	Musharraf replied: I am very happy if what you are saying is right. I would be happy if your conditions are better and your problems solved.        
	You be happy in your conditions and if what you are saying is true, then there is nobody happier than me.        
	Madani also referred to Musharrafs earlier suggestion that both the ISI and RAW were fomenting terrorism in each others countries, saying it amounted to an admission that Pakistan was behind terror attacks in India.        
	You ruled Pakistan for so long and you agree that this happens from both sides. We dont know about both sides but you have admitted that it (fomenting terrorism) is happening from your side.        
	Apparently agitated by Madanis comments, Musharraf said: I believe in presenting my opinion openly. You should also have the courage to listen as much as I have to speak it. If you dont have it, then I will take my words back.

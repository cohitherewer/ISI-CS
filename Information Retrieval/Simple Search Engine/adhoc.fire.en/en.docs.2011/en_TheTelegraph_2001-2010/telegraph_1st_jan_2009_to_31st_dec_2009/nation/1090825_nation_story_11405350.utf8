The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Digvijay tells NCP to merge
                                                                                                               Digvijay tells NCP to merge
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                    
	New Delhi, Aug. 24: Digvijay Singh today said Sharad Pawar should merge his party with the Congress, raising the pitch ahead of seat-sharing talks between the UPA allies for the Maharashtra polls in October.        
	The Congress general secretary, who is on an internal panel for the polls, urged Pawar to adopt the Moopanar formula for the merger of his Nationalist Congress Party, saying the issue on which it was formed  Sonia Gandhis foreign origin  was no longer relevant.        
	Digvijay was echoing a section of the Congress which believes that as a chip off the old block, Pawar should emulate G.K. Moopanar.         
	Moopanar had broken away from the Congress to float the Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC) to protest the Congresss alliance  authored by P.V. Narasimha Rao  with the ADMK in the 1996 general elections. However, the TMC packed up and merged with the Congress after Moopanars death.        
	The NCP and the Congress are of the same stock and ideology. So why shouldnt we get together? Pawar was part of the Congress high command when he left (to form the NCP). He should realise the secular front must be strengthened, said Digvijay.         
	However, Digvijay took care to point out that his comments on the NCP merger were his personal views. Neither Pawar nor anyone else from the NCP reacted to Digvijays merger call.         
	The Congresss official line, iterated by chief spokesperson Janardhan Dwivedi, is that the party has not taken any view on the merger.        
	However, another member of the Maharashtra election committee, said Digvijays comments might be his way of trying to extract a good bargain.         
	Irrespective of Digvijays line, the Congress insists the NCP should accept this years Lok Sabha verdict as the baseline for seat-sharing, with modifications, and not the 2004 Assembly pollresults.         
	Of the 288 Assembly seats, the Congress had contested 161 and the NCP 127. In this years Lok Sabha polls, the Congress fought 26 seats and won 17; the NCP contested 22 and won eight. The Lok Sabha formula translates into 156 seats for the Congress and 132 for the NCP in the upcoming Assembly polls.        
	But the Congress wants 180 seats, pointing to its higher strike in the Lok Sabha polls.

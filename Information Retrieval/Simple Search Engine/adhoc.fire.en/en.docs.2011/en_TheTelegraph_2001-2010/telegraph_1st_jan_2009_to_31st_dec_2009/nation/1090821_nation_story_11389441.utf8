  - 22 children injured, boy says he could smell fuel before fire        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               A schoolgirl who was injured in the fire on Thursday and (above) the school bus. (PTI)				                                       
	Mumbai, Aug. 20: Twenty-two children suffered burns when a minibus taking them to school caught fire after at least one boy caught the smell of kerosene or petrol at the rear of the vehicle.        
	The fire engulfed the bus on the highway at New Panvel in Raigad district, about 60km from Mumbai.        
	According to Panvel police, the private minibus was carrying 38 children in the age group of 12 to 15 to CKT High School.        
	An 11-year-old girl suffered 60 per cent burn injuries and is serious. A 11-year-old boy has suffered 40 per cent burn injuries, a doctor told PTI.        
	We could smell kerosene in the back of the bus, and when the bus caught fire, the driver uncle opened the main door, and asked us to get off. We all rushed out, said a boy who escaped unhurt.        
	Navi Mumbai ACP V. Chandanshive said the statement of the student has been recorded. The boy told me there was smell of kerosene or petrol (in the bus). So we have already registered a case against the driver and owner and arrested them. He added that the exact reason for the fire had not been ascertained.        
	The incident happened around 6.45am. Sixteen children were rescued safely by the bus driver and cleaner with the help of residents. Twenty-two suffered burn injuries, out which 18 were hospitalised. Four were allowed to go home after first aid, CKT School principal N.M. Jadhav told The Telegraph over the phone.        
	He said the children were rushed to different hospitals in Mumbai and Navi Mumbai.         
	The school has nine other contracted buses, but this was a private bus. The exact cause of the fire is being investigated by the police. Taking moral responsibility for the mishap, we have decided to bear the medical expenses of all students, said Jadhav.        
	Panvel police have lodged a complaint under sections that carry jail terms ranging from three months to three years.        
	Suresh Bhosale, senior inspector of Panvel police station, said: The RTO and forensic experts visited the spot and inspected the school bus to determine if any inflammatory substance caused the fire. We are yet to get their report. We have arrested owner and bus driver, and detained the cleaner for questioning.        
	In January 2008, a fire in a Maruti Omni converted into a school van had killed four children in Jogeshwari in Mumbais western suburbs. The driver did not possess a carriage permit, and had altered the fuel system to run the car on petrol if the LPG cylinder ran out of gas. He was held on charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, July 18: Heavy exchange of fire continued in the dense forest of Chandiposh at Rourkela for the second day today.        
	The combing operation had begun yesterday following the abduction and murder of sub-inspector Ajit Bardhan by Maoists. Around 3pm today, security personnel reached the site to collect Bardhans bullet-ridden body.         
	The delay was attributed to movement by foot for the fear of landmines. The jawans did face a landmine blast on the way. But no one was injured in the incident.         
	The jawans also managed to nab a suspected rebel and seize landmines from him. He is being interrogated.         
	Rebels also felled a large number of trees to stall the movement of security forces. The explosive-laden vehicle that was looted yesterday had been set ablaze by Maoists.         
	It belonged to a material supplying private company and was carrying at least 8 tonne of explosives, said superintendent of police Sundargarh Diptesh Patnaik. He added that rebels had managed a similar loot from the same company four years ago. They had fled with the explosives after setting ablaze the vehicle.         
	Meanwhile, in yet another strike, the rebels blew up the Ktainga outpost under Bramhinigaon police station in Kandhamal district last night. Armed rebels, including women, blew up the police outpost using powerful explosives at 1am today.         
	Four constables went missing since the attack, raising fears of abduction by rebels. But they reached home later in the day. Rebels also felled trees to block the Brahmanigaon-Jhinjiriguda road.

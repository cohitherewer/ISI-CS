The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Court summons Vijayan
                                                                                                               Court summons Vijayan
          JOHN MARY                               
	Thiruvananthapuram, June 23: A court today issued a summons on Pinarayi Vijayan in the SNC-Lavalin scam, asking the Kerala CPM secretary to appear before it on September 24.        
	If Vijayan accepts the summons  he can move the high court before that  he will become the first state CPM secretary to show up in court as an accused in a corruption case. Eight others have also been sent the summons.        
	P.N. Jyotheendranath, the judge of the CBI special court in Kochi, also ordered a probe against Congress ex-minister G. Karthikeyan and a former state power board member. Their names had been kept out of the list of the accused for want of evidence.         
	In an earlier report filed in the high court, the CBI had said Karthikeyan initiated the conspiracy with Canadas SNC Lavalin as power minister before Vijayan.        
	CPM leader and power minister A.K. Balan said the order against Karthikeyan proved our (the CPMs) charge that Vijayan had been targeted.

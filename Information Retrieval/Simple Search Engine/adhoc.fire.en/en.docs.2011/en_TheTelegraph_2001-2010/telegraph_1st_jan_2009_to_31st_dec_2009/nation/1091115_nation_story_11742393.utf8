          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Jaipur, Nov. 14: At least seven people died when more than a dozen compartments of a Delhi-bound train from Jodhpur overturned and broken rails sliced through one after the express hurtled off tracks near the Pink City early today.        
	Another 25 were injured in the crash, the fifth train accident in the past 40 days        
	Officials said the Jodhpur-Delhi Mandore Express jumped tracks around 1.30 last night near Bassi, some 40km from Jaipur, about half an hour after it had left the Rajasthan capital. Among the 15 bogies that overturned were five AC coaches, seven sleeper-class compartments and three general compartments.        
	The worst affected was B-1, through which ripped-off tracks had sliced through. Railway officials put the toll at seven, most of whom were probably passengers of this coach.        
	Four of the dead have been identified as Sonal Singh, 18, a student of National Law University in Jodhpur, Sudhir, 35, of Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh, Ujjawal, 27, and Mandeep, 42, of Delhi.        
	Most of the injured were first taken to a hospital in Bassi but later transferred to Sawai Man Singh Hospital in Jaipur by a relief train.        
	Railway commercial officer .P. Kulshrestha told The Telegraph initial inquiries had revealed that changing of tracks near a railway crossing at high speed might have led to the accident.        
	Survivors recalled they awoke to the piercing screech of brakes and moments later were flung off their berths.        
	Witnesses said the driver braked hard, causing the bogies to overturn at high speed. Then the lights went out. In the AC coaches, people suffocated and many fainted before being pulled out by local people.        
	Some, like Manohar Lal Bishnoi, managed to crawl to the door. But the IAF airman has been maimed for life. He lost his right hand and has a fracture in his left.        
	I was sleeping in a middle berth when a loud thud threw me off. I felt a searing pain in my arms. It was dark and I managed to crawl to the door and remember somebody taking me out, said the 27-year-old who was returning to Bagdogra after a months leave in Jodhpur.        
	Manish Chauhan, 24, an employee with Max Insurance, was on his way back to Delhi after a tour of Jodhpur. Today, his right leg gone, he was drifting in and out of consciousness.        
	New Zealand resident Ana Costley, on her way to Delhi to catch a flight back home , said a sudden huge jolt tossed her out of her seat. The lights went out, someone managed to push open the emergency window after 15 minutes through which I just slid through, Ana, who suffered head and thigh injuries and had to be given at least four stitches, said.        
	The railway ministry has announced Rs 5 lakh as compensation for families of the dead, Rs 1 lakh for the seriously injured and Rs 10,000 for those with minor injuries. The Rajasthan government has announced Rs 2 lakh as compensation for relatives of the deceased.

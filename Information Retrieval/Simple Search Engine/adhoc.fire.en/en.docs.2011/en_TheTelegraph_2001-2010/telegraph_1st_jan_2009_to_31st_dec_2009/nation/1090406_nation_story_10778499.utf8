	Bhubaneswar, April 5: The first phase of the Vedanta University project was set in motion with the announcement of its world-class teaching and research hospital here today.         
	The 500-bed varsity hospital, coming up near the Puri-Konark Marine Drive, will mark the commencement of the first phase of the varsity billed to be Indias answer to Harvard. The hospital will stress on patient care, research and teaching.         
	The multi-speciality hospital aims to address a long-standing need for comprehensive healthcare services for the people of the region. Orders for construction have already been placed with Larsen and Toubro Limited, said project director Sanjeev Anand Zutshi.         
	The conceptual planning and design of the hospital has been prepared by leading US-based hospital design firm Perkins + Wills, which earlier designed state-of-the-art teaching and research hospitals at John Hopkins University and University of California in Los Angeles.         
	In addition to new initiatives in medicine, the first phase of the university will include schools of education, arts and sciences, engineering, management and nursing. The hospital and initial academic programmes will begin in 2011.         
	Commending the initiative, cardiologist K.P. Mishra said: The hospital will serve as a regional hub for critical specialities, including cardiology and diabetology. Renowned doctors from India and abroad will be providing quality care at an affordable cost, he added. The varsity has already initiated research programs with local relevance.         
	Dipika Mohanty, a recipient of the Biju Pattnaik award for excellence in science and technology, has begun a Vedanta-sponsored research project on interventions that can address the disproportionate prevalence of anaemia in infants and children in Orissa.

	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 19: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik today urged the Centre to set up a National Institute of Design (NID) here and offered necessary infrastructure, including land.        
	An NID focusing on handloom and handicraft can ideally be located in Orissa to serve tribal regions in not just the state but also Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and the entire eastern region, Naveen said, while meeting Union minister for commerce and industry Ananda Sharma in New Delhi today.        
	The new national design policy formulated by the Centre envisages establishment of four new design institutes on the pattern of National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad, during 11th plan. Three locations have already been identified to cover central, southern and north-eastern regions.        
	Sharma has agreed to consider the proposal, said an official release.        
	Naveen also requested Sharma to include Orissa in the e-biz programme along with the five states already identified. Sharma agreed to include Orissa in the e-biz programme in the coming year which will facilitate industrial promotion and project monitoring, the release added.        
	Sharma was also urged to approve the proposal for organising International Trade Fair for Orissa handicrafts annually for three years at an estimated cost of Rs 3.3 crore under market access initiative of the commerce ministry. He agreed to the state governments proposal to organise the trade fair in Orissa in January 2010.

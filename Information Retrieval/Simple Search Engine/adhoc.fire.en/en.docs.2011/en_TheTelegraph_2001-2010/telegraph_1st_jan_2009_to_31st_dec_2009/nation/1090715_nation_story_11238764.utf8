          NASIR JAFFRY                              
	Islamabad, July 14: Pakistans Punjab government today said it was withdrawing its appeal against the Lashkar chiefs release, the move coming as a potential damper ahead of this weeks talks between Manmohan Singh and Yousaf Raza Gilani in Egypt.        
	Hafiz Mohammad Saeed heads the Jamat-ud-Dawa (JuD), an alleged front of the Lashkar, blamed by India for the Mumbai attack. He was freed last month by Lahore High Court after six months of house arrest.        
	The Punjab government had filed an appeal challenging Saeeds release on the directives of the federal government, which has failed to provide us any substantial evidence or documentary proof against the JuD, Punjab advocate-general Raza Farooq told the Supreme Court. The provincial government has, therefore, decided to withdraw its appeal, he added.                    
	The Punjab and central governments had filed two identical petitions early this month challenging the release of Saeed, who had been freed for lack of proof on his role in the attack.        
	Today, the three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry asked the federal government to come up with its position in two days.         
	The announcement of the appeals withdrawal came as Prime Minister Gilani left for Egypt, where he is to meet Singh on Thursday on the sidelines of the NAM summit.         
	Although he told reporters before leaving that he would hold talks with Singh with an open mind, analysts felt todays development didnt augur well for the meeting. The timing of the Punjab governments decision to withdraw the petition is strange as it coincided with the departure of Prime Minister Gilani, Imtiaz Gul, the head of the Centre for Research and Security Studies, said.

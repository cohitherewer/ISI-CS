The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Naveen still mum over suicide spree
                                                                                                               Naveen still mum over suicide spree
  - Alarm bells ring over crop loss        SUBRAT DAS                          The family of Bidyadhar Bag. (Sanjib Mukherjee)                                        
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 1: A string of farmer suicides indicate that all is not well with the states agriculture sector.        
	As chief minister Naveen Patnaik grapples with mounting criticism from various quarters, there is growing concern over the looming drought in the state and pest attacks destroying crops, driving the farmers to penury. In the past three months, seven farmers have committed suicide allegedly after failing to repay loans following crop failure.        
	On August 11, Balaram Bhoi, 42, of Gulamal village of Rengali block in Sambalpur, committed suicide by consuming pesticide, unable to bear a caterpillar attack on his four-acre paddy field. Bhoi had borrowed Rs 40,000 from a moneylender.         
	On October 5, Gaurahari Patra, 48, a marginal paddy farmer of Sagarpali village of Lakhanpur block in adjoining Jharsuguda, who had availed a loan of Rs 20,000 from a co-operative society, ended his life after all the crop in his five-acre field was damaged due to erratic rainfall and caterpillars.         
	Patras death was followed by that of Bidyadhar Bag, 40, of Khapsadera village under Sambalpurs Rengali block on October 7. Bag who cultivated paddy over five acres had borrowed Rs 15,000 from a private moneylender. Meanwhile, four more debt-ridden farmers have followed suit, forcing the government to wake up.         
	In western Orissa, where most of the suicides were reported, a peculiar share cropping system is in vogue. Small and marginal farmers borrow land from landlords and give seven bags of paddy (75 kg each) as rent, whether there is a yield or not. Similarly, a private fertiliser dealer takes a bag of paddy in exchange of a bag of fertiliser that he grants on credit.         
	The government, which has been brushing aside Opposition allegations about the prevailing distressed situation, has now admitted that kharif crop has been adversely affected due to erratic rainfall and pest attacks.        
	Kharif production was adversely affected in some pockets due to erratic rainfall and caterpillar attacks. Small and marginal farmers may be under stress after losing their crop, admitted agriculture minister Damodar Rout.        
	According to a latest official estimate, standing paddy over 4.4 lakh hectares was affected due to moisture stress (which occurred in 3.15 lakh hectare) and pest attacks (that occurred over 1.25 lakh hectare). Besides, non-paddy kharif crops have been affected in 35,991 hectares due to the above two factors. As many as 11 districts out of 30 have received deficient rainfall ranging from 3 to 35.3 per cent in the past four months (June-October).        
	Ashok Pradhan, president of Sambalpur Krushak Surakshya Sangathan, said farmers were not ready to face the twin menace of caterpillars and drought, which occurred in the state after a gap of 40 years.        
	Crop loss due to arid climate or flood is almost an annual affair. There was crop loss in 2008 and 2004 due to moisture stress and due to floods in 2005, 2006 and 2007. But, the suicides gave Congress and the BJP a readymade issue to beat the BJD government with, said S.N. Mishra, a political analyst.         
	What made Naveen constitute a party-level team and order a probe by agriculture production commissioner and announce a package for affected farmers? He was driven by political expediency than real concern, believes Orissa Krushak Mahasangh president Bibhudendra Pratap Das.

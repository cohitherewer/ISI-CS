The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | See-saw on bill for foreign varsities
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      See-saw on bill for foreign varsities
  - Plan to scale up corpus requirement         CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                      Manmohan Singh,   whose office wants as   few disincentives as   possible in the bill                                
	New Delhi, Dec. 25: Foreign universities will need to guarantee a corpus fund five times the amount proposed earlier, under last-minute changes to a proposed law to regulate foreign educational institutions entering India.        
	If the cabinet approves the changes, these institutions must set aside a corpus fund of at least Rs 50 crore instead of the Rs 10 crore mentioned in the bill till a fortnight ago.        
	The hiked amount, proposed by the health ministry, has been accepted by the human resource development ministry, The Telegraph has learnt. The HRD ministry is incorporating the change into the Foreign Educational Institutions (Regulation of Entry and Operations) Bill, 2009, before it is placed before the cabinet.        
	The change is aimed at strengthening a deterrent for fly-by-night institutions, sources said. But the move is potentially controversial because it could be a disincentive to interested institutions.        
	Although the bill, drafted in 2007 under then HRD minister Arjun Singh, has been significantly altered under the second UPA government, the corpus fund amount had stayed Rs 10 crore till now.        
	The health ministry proposal and the HRD ministrys decision to accept it appear contrary to moves by the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) to strip the bill of any clauses that might deter foreign universities.        
	But many of the clauses that the PMO wants tweaked or removed are critical to protecting the interests of students, their parents and Indian education, sections within the government have argued.        
	The differences in views between various government arms led to the bill being referred to a committee of secretaries (CoS), which has vetted the draft and forwarded its recommendations. HRD minister Kapil Sibal is keen to table the bill in the next budget session of Parliament, sources said.        
	The corpus fund is a critical component of the governments measures to ensure that students and employees of foreign institutions in India do not suffer if the institutions default on commitments.        
	The Centre will use the fund and an institutions properties to pay employees and help students find alternative higher education opportunities if a university loses its foreign education provider tag, or decides to shut shop in India.        
	The bill states that it shall be the governments duty to ensure alternative and appropriate educational facilities to students enrolled with a foreign education provider that closes down. This clause and the corpus fund are aimed at shielding students from fly-by-night operators.        
	The principal amount of the corpus fund cannot be touched by the educational institution. Of the interest earned from the principal, 75 per cent can be reinvested into the institution, the bill says, while the remaining 25 per cent must be added to the corpus fund.

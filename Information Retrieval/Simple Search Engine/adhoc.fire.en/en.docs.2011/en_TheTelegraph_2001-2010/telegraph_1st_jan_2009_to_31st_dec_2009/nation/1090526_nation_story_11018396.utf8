The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | SC raps anthem tinker Ram Gopal 
                                                                                                               SC raps anthem tinker Ram Gopal 
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, May 25: The Supreme Court today rapped film-maker Ram Gopal Varma for tinkering with the national anthem in his forthcoming release Rann starring Amitabh Bachchan.        
	It declined to hear his plea against the censor boards refusal to clear the song, Jana gann mana rann.        
	It (the song) is totally negative. It tries to negate every line of the national anthem, a two-judge bench said. No one has a right to tinker with the national anthem.        
	Varma had moved the apex court alleging the censors never gave him a chance to defend his views, violating his freedom of speech and expression.        
	The Central Board for Film Certification had on May 8 refused to clear the promos of the song saying it violated the National Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950. The board said the song had tampered with the national anthem and distorted its lyrics.        
	Several TV channels have refused to air the promos, and on May 13, Vodafone refused to upload the song as a caller tune on its network.        
	Varmas counsel Arun Jaitley told the court his client had no intention of disparaging the national anthem. He has only used it as an inspiration to draw attention to our problems.        
	According to Varmas petition, the song is a patriotic one that seeks to awaken people to the dangers facing the country. Varma has also argued that citizens have the right to draw inspiration from the national anthem or symbols for the purpose of artistic expression.        
	Jaitley said the film was ready for a September release and this will only delay its distribution. But the bench wondered why Varma had not first gone to the Appellate Tribunal for Film Certification, and then to the high court before approaching the apex court. It asked Varma to go to the appellate tribunal, and directed the tribunal to dispose of his appeal within a month.

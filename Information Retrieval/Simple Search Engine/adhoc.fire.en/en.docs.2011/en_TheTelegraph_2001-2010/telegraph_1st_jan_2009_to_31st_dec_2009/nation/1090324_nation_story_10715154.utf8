The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cop rams car, Indian students   die in US
                                                                                                               Cop rams car, Indian students   die in US
                                  
	New York, March 23 (PTI): Four Indian IT students were killed when an off-duty and apparently drunk policewoman rammed her car into their vehicle on a highway in Missouri.        
	The students were returning home in a Honda Accord when the policewomans SUV, speeding down the wrong lane, hit them head-on in Des Peres, authorities said.        
	There were five students in the car, all from Andhra Pradesh and pursuing their MS in information technology in Eastern Illinois University. Anusha Anumolu, 23, Satya S. Chinta, 25, Anita Lakshmi, 23, and Priya Muppvarapu, 23, died on the spot. Nitesh Adusumilli, 27, who was driving the car, was seriously injured.        
	The policewoman, identified as Chrissy Miller, 41, is in critical condition in hospital, media reports said. Miller works with the Sunset Hills police department.         
	They had planned to go to an Indian restaurant and a bowling alley and they were returning home, said Suren Pathuri, an acquaintance of the victims. He said the bodies of the four victims would be sent to India.        
	We do suspect that alcohol may have played a part in this crash on Millers part, said Missouri state highway patrol sergeant Al Nothum.        
	Investigation is ongoing, he said.

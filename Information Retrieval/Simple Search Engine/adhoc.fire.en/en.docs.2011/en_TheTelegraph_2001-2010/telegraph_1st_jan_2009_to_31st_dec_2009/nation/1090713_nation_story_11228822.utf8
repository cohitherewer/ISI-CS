The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Blame on police for Shopian innuendo 
                                                                                                               Blame on police for Shopian innuendo 
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Srinagar, July 12: A retired judge probing the rape and murder of two Shopian women today said the part of his report that cast aspersions on their character was not his findings but that of police.         
	Former Jammu and Kashmir High Court judge Justice Muzaffar Jans report, made public on Friday, doubted the character of Shakeel Ahmad, a Shopian businessman, his wife Neelofar, 22, and sister Asiya, 17. It also hinted at Shakeels involvement in the murders.         
	The Valley has been engulfed in protests since the bodies of Neelofar and Asiya were found in Shopian on May 30. Popular perception is that they were raped and murdered by security forces.        
	Although the commission headed by Jan has not ruled out the possibility of police involvement and recommended that then superintendent Javed Mattoo and four other officers be treated as accused for destroying evidence, its report triggered an uproar by putting the blame on the victims, too.         
	He (Shakeel) does not carry a good reputation in society and was known for his immoral activities, the report said.         
	According to it, Neelofar and Asiya were frequent visitors to the orchard from where they went missing. The purpose of their regular and frequent visit could not be established so far. It is quite possible that during these frequent visits to the orchard in the last six/seven months, they must have developed some relation with other persons. Shakeel had come to know about this relation which could have led to the planning and execution of this incident, the report added.         
	Today, Jan denied having penned this portion of the report. This is basically the report contained in three pages that were given to me by the police team deputed for my assistance. They were kept in the report with my knowledge but these are not my findings but theirs, he said.         
	The police had questioned 60 witnesses and they compiled their report on the basis of their evidence. I, on the other hand, recorded the statements of 40 witness and none of them is common. The two reports have got mixed up.         
	Senior superintendent of police Haseeb Mughal, who led the police team assisting Jan, said the judges findings could not be different from that of the police. The police investigation team working with Justice Jan forms a part of the commission. How can he separate us from that?         
	Shakeel has threatened to file a defamation suit against Jan. How can one make speculative remarks about a person that he planned the rape and murder of his own wife and sister? he asked.         
	Majlis-Mashawarat, a committee of local elders spearheading the campaign for justice in Shopian, rejected the findings of the commission today and decided to continue with their strike in the town.

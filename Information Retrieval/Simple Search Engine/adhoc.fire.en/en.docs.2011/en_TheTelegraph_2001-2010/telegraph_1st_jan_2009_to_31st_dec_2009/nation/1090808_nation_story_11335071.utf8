The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Buta Singh linked to Bagmati breach
                                                                                                               Buta Singh linked to Bagmati breach
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Buta Singh: In double trouble                                  
	Patna, Aug. 7: A day after a Mumbai court granted bail to the chairman of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes, Buta Singh, and his son, the two faced fresh trouble with the Bihar government instituting a probe into Singhs role in the Bagmati embankment project.         
	A team of technical experts, headed by former Bihar engineer-in-chief K.N. Lal, are slated to investigate Buta Singhs order to allot Rs 900 crore to the Bagmati embankment work to Hindustan Steel Work Construction Limited in 2005.         
	The Bihar government believes that Buta Singh, who was the governor in 2005 when Presidents rule was on in the state, handed over work to HSCL in violation of stipulated norms, as the firm had no prior experience in embankment projects.         
	Moreover, water resources department sources said that the work that involved a large sum of money was allotted minus any tenders being invited.         
	This was the same embankment that was breached on August 1, 2009, in Runi Saidpur block of north Bihars Sitamarchi inundating about six blocks in Sitamarhi and Muzaffarpur districts.         
	The breach and a following inquiry revealed the former Bihar governors connection with the HSCL and the embankment. The matter came to our notice when we begun the probe, said state water resources minister Bijendra Yadav talking to The Telegraph today.         
	The construction work of the embankment was allotted in violation of work codes. No tender was invited and the company that bagged the work had no prior experience in river embankment projects, he added.         
	The minister said the probe team has been directed to submit a report as soon as possible. The government then will take appropriate legal action against Buta Singh based on the report, said the minister, adding: Why should the Nitish Kumar-led government take the blame for a wrong done by others.         
	Sources added that the former administration, headed by Buta Singh, allotted Rs 900 crore to HSCL in three phases despite objections raised then by former development commissioner G.S. Kang on the manner in which the company was building the embankment on the Bagmati.

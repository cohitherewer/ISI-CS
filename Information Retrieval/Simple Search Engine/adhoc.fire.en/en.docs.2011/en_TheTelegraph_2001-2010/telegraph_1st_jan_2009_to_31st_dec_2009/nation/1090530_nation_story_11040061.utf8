The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Moily vows justice to last man in queue
                                                                                                               Moily vows justice to last man in queue
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, May 29: After rural jobs, health and education, the UPA government has extended its common man slogan to the sphere of justice.        
	M. Veerappa Moily today formally took over as law minister and immediately promised a five-year action plan to clean the Augean stables  the backlog of over three crore cases that is choking the justice delivery system.        
	The next five years will be a period of judicial reforms. We have to ensure that the rule of law is for every individual... the aam aadmi, he told a news conference minutes after taking office, pledging also to bring accountability among judges.        
	Moily promised to cut the delays and legal costs that have made the judicial system virtually inaccessible to the common man. The last man in the queue should get justice. The aam aadmi should not feel he is at odds (with the system).        
	Asked about Calcutta High Court judge Soumitra Sen, against whom an impeachment motion is pending with the Rajya Sabha, Moily said: The government has no vested interest in protecting anybody.        
	The Chief Justice of India (CJI) has recommended that Sen be impeached over allegations of misusing money as a receiver while he was a lawyer. A motion has been introduced in the Rajya Sabha, at the initiative of the Left parties, to remove him from office.        
	Moily said he was in favour of strengthening the in-house system to deal with complaints against judges.        
	We will initiate a dialogue with the judiciary on ensuring accountability and dealing with corruption. If necessary, we will bring in a law (to get judges to declare their assets).        
	Supreme Court judges now voluntarily file a statement about their assets and liabilities with the CJI. But the CJI has so far refused to place them in the public domain, insisting a law be first enacted to prevent misuse of such information.        
	Moily promised comprehensive judicial reforms. Judicial reforms cannot be partial, fragmented. We have to go in for a holistic approach. Addressing one side of the problem cannot solve it, he said.        
	He admitted that the reforms must begin at home - the CJI has publicly identified government litigation as the largest component of fresh cases filed in the courts.        
	We are aware that the government is the biggest litigant. We will see how best to address this problem. It is not a legal problem; it is a government problem, Moily said.        
	The minister added that instead of focusing merely on court delays, the government would focus also on cutting delays at the investigative stage. Equipping every police station with a forensic laboratory would go a long way in addressing this problem, he said.        
	Moily had suggested several measures to improve governance when he headed the second Administrative Reforms Commission. One of the recommendations was to repeal archaic laws, such as the draconian Official Secrets Act. There are over 1,000 such laws.

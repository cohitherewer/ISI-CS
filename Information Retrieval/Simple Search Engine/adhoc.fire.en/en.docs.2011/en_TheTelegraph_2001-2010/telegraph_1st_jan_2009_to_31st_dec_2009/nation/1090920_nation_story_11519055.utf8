          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 19: Emboldened by the RJDs success in the Bihar bypolls, Lalu Prasad met Sonia Gandhi this morning to convince her of his unflinching support, but the Congress is unlikely to accept his offer to get close in the garb of secular unity against the BJP in Jharkhand.        
	Details of what transpired between the two werent made public  Lalu Prasad is understood to have declared he would never oppose Sonia come what may  but his confidant Prem Gupta, who accompanied him to 10 Janpath, later said the purpose was to convince Sonia about a united fight in Jharkhand, which could see elections in December-January.        
	In view of the bypoll success in Bihar, Lalu Prasad fancies his chances of a comeback in the state if the Congress supports him. He had compelled the Congress to fight alone by offering it only three seats in the last Lok Sabha elections.         
	Congress leaders associated with election management in Jharkhand said the chances of an alliance with the RJD were bleak but conceded that the Congress was still studying the fluid political situation.         
	I cant fathom how the Bihar policy of keeping a distance from Lalu would be reversed in Jharkhand. But we are not in good shape in Jharkhand and the leaders are still weighing options, a senior leader said.         
	The Jharkhand unit of the party is, however, opposed to any understanding with the RJD.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 14: Police today gunned down three alleged abductors and rescued a Noida official who was trussed up and kept below the rear seat of the assailants car.        
	The rescued official, Shiv Dutt, is the private secretary of the chief executive officer of the Greater Noida Authority, Mohinder Singh.        
	Dutt said he was kidnapped in Noida yesterday by the trio who offered him a lift and pounced on him as soon as he got into the car they were travelling in.        
	The suspected abductors were identified as Shekhar Sharma of Dankaur in Greater Noida, Mohammad Waseem of Loni and Imran of Maujpur in Delhi  all with records in petty crimes in the capital and its outskirts.        
	Sources said that when the false ATM pin number Dutt had given them did not work, the abductors had called his home more than once, asking for the correct code first and then Rs 10 lakh as ransom. The calls helped the police track down the general location of the car.        
	A police team this morning chased the car and killed the trio in Sector 88 of the township, an officer said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cash slur in BJD win
                                                                                                               Cash slur in BJD win
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 10: The Opposition today disrupted Assembly proceedings, demanding a statement from outgoing higher education minister Samir Dey explaining reasons of his resignation from the cabinet.        
	Dey had resigned on Saturday owning moral responsibility for his partys debacle in the recent Cuttack Municipal Corporation elections.        
	Though Dey had cited the dismal performance of his party in CMC polls as the reason, there were speculations that the BJP minister had been asked to quit as he had allegedly cast aspersions indirectly on the chief minister by stating that BJD had won the urban body elections with the help of money power and by tampering with electronic voting machines.        
	In a bid to capitalise the issue, Opposition members today stormed the well of the Assembly, seeking a statement from Dey explaining the circumstances leading to his resignation.         
	They forced two adjournments for an hour by causing noisy and uproarious scenes, as Speaker Kishore Mohanty rejected their demand.        
	They also argued that the chief minister had no moral right to continue in power as one of his ministerial colleagues had levelled serious allegation against him and his party. Tempers ran high as the Opposition and ruling party members traded charges against each other.        
	Dismissing the allegations of tampering electronic voting machines as baseless, parliamentary affairs minister Raghunath Mohanty said such matter should not be discussed as a statutory body like election commission was involved. However, the Opposition members did not agree and the debate continued till late afternoon. None of the business listed for the day could be taken up because of the debate over the issue.         
	Neither Dey nor chief minister Naveen Patnaik was present in the House today.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Surrender sop to wean away Maoists
                                                                                                               Surrender sop to wean away Maoists
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Sept. 7: The Centre has devised a surrender scheme for Naxalites, with sops ranging from a fixed deposit of Rs 1.5 lakh, stipend of Rs 2,000 for three years to incentives on weapons given up.        
	Home minister P. Chidambaram feels that as the Maoist problem has arisen because of real and perceived neglect and deprivation, the solution should aim at providing employment and entrepreneurial opportunities to surrendered Naxalites.        
	This might encourage them to join the mainstream and not return to the Naxalite fold, sources said. State governments will be responsible for implementing the scheme.        
	Attempts have been made to evolve the policy in a way that the surrendered Naxalite would gain employment while a safety mechanism in the policy would not allow him to avail himself of all the benefits if his behaviour is not up to the mark.        
	So, the fixed deposit of Rs 1.5 lakh and the incentive from surrendered weapons will be available only after three years of good behaviour. The surrendered militant can use the fixed deposit as collateral for taking loans.        
	Another important aspect is training surrendered Naxalites in vocational trades to help them find jobs.        
	An additional director-general of police or an inspector-general will act as rehabilitation officer. Paramilitary forces and the state administration would also be involved in the process.

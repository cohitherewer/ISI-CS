The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Kitchen quarrels to ballot battle

	Cuttack, Jan. 28: The saas-bahu bickerings have spilled to the electoral battlefield too.        
	Former Cuttack Municipality Corporation (CMC) councillor Padmalata Rout is contesting the February 6 civic poll from ward No. 37 on a BJD ticket, while the Congress has pitted her daughter-in-law, (wife of nephew), Lily Routray, against her.        
	The affable mother-in-law, however, says her blessings are with Lily. But whoever wins the battle of ballots, the Rout family will be the winner, she quips. Saas-bahu rivalry in politics is not unheard of but certainly a new phenomenon here, said Bimal Mohanty, a septuagenarian.        
	Besides saas-bahu, this year would also witness poll-fight between other family members. Cuttack district BJD vice-president Niranjan Karans daughter-in-law Ranjita is taking on his sister Renubala Routs daughter-in-law Mrunalini, an Independent, in ward No. 49. The political contest is also turning out to be quite intense. Renubala, a former Congress councillor, had contested under the banner of breakaway Orissa Congress against nephew Nisith Karan (BJD) in the last election too and was defeated.        
	The decision not to avert the contest between the two sister-in-laws this time was entirely her prerogative, Niranjan said, suggesting he was neither surprised nor unhappy about it.         
	Niranjans is not the only family where the battle of ballots has invaded the kitchen. In ward No. 21, BJP candidate Pravat Baral is taking on Smita Mulia, the elder sister of wife of Pravats elder brother. Smita, a former CMC deputy chairman, was forced to contest when Samrudha Orissa fielded her after she had been denied a BJD ticket. She had lost as the BJD candidate to former mayor Nibedita Pradhan of BJP in the last election.        
	Reservation process also has an unprecedented fallout. Former BJP corporator Hrushikesh Pradhan has ensured a party ticket for wife Ranjita after ward No. 45 was declared reserved for women.         
	Similarly, former Congress corporator Rabindra Kumar Patnaik was replaced by his wife Basanta Manjari Patnaik at ward No. 35.

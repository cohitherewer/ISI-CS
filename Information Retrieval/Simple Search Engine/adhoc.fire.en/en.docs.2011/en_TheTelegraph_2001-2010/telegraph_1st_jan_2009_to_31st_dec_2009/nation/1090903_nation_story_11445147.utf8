The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | An eye   on the groomed son
                                                                                                               An eye   on the groomed son
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA AND SANJAY K. JHA                      Jaganmohan                                
	Hyderabad, Sept. 2: Many Congress leaders are too shaken to discuss the sensitive issue but some have started wondering if the worst fears come true, which way will the Andhra chief ministers baton pass.        
	One name doing the rounds is that of Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy, the son of Y.S. Rajashekhar Reddy.         
	Jagan, as he is known in the state, has been following in his fathers footsteps in politics. The son became a sarpanch of Pulivendula, the same post held by his father, in the early eighties when YSR entered the Assembly.        
	However, Jagan ran into a hitch in 2004 when YSR asked his older brother Y.S. Vivekananda Reddy to vacate the Kadapa Parliament seat for Jagan. The brother agreed but the Congress high command did not.        
	But Jagan, the Prince of Pulivendula, stayed in touch with Congress leaders like Ghulam Nabi Azad, Digvijay Singh and also Veerappa Moily.                  Chief security officer ASC Wesley and principal secretary S Subramanyam, who were on board YSR rsquo;s chopper on Wednesday. (PTI)    
	This year, by when YSRs political fortunes had soared, Jagan got a Lok Sabha ticket from Kadapa and won the election. During the campaign, he used to say: It is just natural that not only do I speak and have the mannerisms of my father, but I also enjoy the adulation of the people.         
	In Delhi, Congress sources said the thought of succession had not crossed anyones mind. Party spokesperson Manish Tiwari said: We are praying for him. This is not the time for any other talk.        
	In private, some Congress leaders said YSRs relentless rise had ensured there was no clear-cut number two.        
	The two important leaders in the ranks are K. Rosaiah and D. Srinivas. While finance minister Rosiah is only a member of the legislative council, PCC president Srinivas has lost the election, leaving YSR as the biggest mass leader in the state.        
	Other senior leaders Janardhan Reddy and Hanumantha Rao have virtually been cut off from state politics.

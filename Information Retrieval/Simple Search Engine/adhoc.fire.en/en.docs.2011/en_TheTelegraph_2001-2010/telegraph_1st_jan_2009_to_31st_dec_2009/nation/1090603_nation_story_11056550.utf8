The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Diplomats stage coup, get reins of both Houses
                                                                                                               Diplomats stage coup, get reins of both Houses
  - Foreign service to parliament          JAYANTH JACOB                          Meira Kumar in Parliament on Tuesday. (PTI)                                         
	New Delhi, June 2: One job is about genteel conversation with foreign dignitaries, the other about hitting a desk repeatedly and trying to shout above the din.        
	Still, the Indian Foreign Service (IFS) has bridged the gulf so well that it now has both Houses of Parliament under its watch. Or rather, two of its former members have.        
	For the first time, both Houses will have ex-diplomats as their presiding officers when Meira Kumar is formally elected Lok Sabha Speaker tomorrow.        
	Meira is from the 1973 batch of the IFS and left the service in 1985; Vice-President Hamid Ansari, who is chairman of the Rajya Sabha by virtue of his office, is from the 1961 batch.        
	Foreign service mandarins joining politics and becoming ministers is not new, though. K. Natwar Singh, who had joined the service in 1953 and served for 31 years, later became external affairs minister. Mani Shankar Aiyar, a minister in the last UPA government, had been in the service from 1963 till 1989.        
	Meira and Ansari, however, have had different career trajectories in the IFS. Meira had quit the service early to join politics while Ansari, in his nearly four-decade-long career, held an array of glittering postings.        
	Meiras batchmates include Nalin Suri and N. Ravi, both secretaries in the foreign ministry; Nirupama Rao, envoy to China; and Meera Shankar, ambassador to Washington. Meira was posted in Spain and Britain and served at South Block, the ministry headquarters.        
	Calcutta-born Ansari has been Indias permanent representative to the UN in New York, ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, Iran and Afghanistan, and high commissioner to Australia.        
	So, can their IFS training help them maintain peace in the Houses?        
	Hmm, maybe IFS officers are protocol-conscious, after all, a serving official grinned.        
	If the jest contains a grain of truth, Ansari should be well-placed in his current job. He was chief of protocol to the government from 1980 to 1985, a key post that entails accompanying the Prime Minister on all foreign trips and looking after the arrangements for foreign visitors.        
	Whatever his feelings about protocol, Ansari has tried to bring in changes in the way the Upper House is run. He has ensured that the Rajya Sabha takes up 10 issues during zero hour, that each speaker gets a maximum of three minutes, and that not more than two members are allowed to supplement an issue.        
	The microphone is switched off the moment a speaker exhausts his three minutes. Meira would find it a little more difficult to enforce silence in her House.

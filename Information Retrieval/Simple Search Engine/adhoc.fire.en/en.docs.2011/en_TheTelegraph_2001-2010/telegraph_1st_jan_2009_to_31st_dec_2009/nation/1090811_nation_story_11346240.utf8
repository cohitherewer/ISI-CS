          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Aug. 10: Kerala CPM state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan today moved the Supreme Court against the governors sanction to the CBI to prosecute him in the SNC Lavalin power scam.        
	Vijayan, the first CPM politburo member to be staring at a corruption trial, urged the court to set aside governor R.S. Gavais June 7 order allowing the agency to proceed against him and to quash the chargesheet filed three days later.        
	The governor had allowed the prosecution against the recommendation of the Left government, which had gone by the opinion of the advocate-general.        
	The advocate-general felt there wasnt enough evidence against Vijayan. However, the CBI insisted there was, and applied to the governor for the sanction.        
	The cabinet decided against Vijayans prosecution despite the fact that he has been at loggerheads with chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan. The CPM maintains the case is politically motivated.        
	Vijayan is accused of irregularities in awarding a contract to Canadian company Lavalin during his tenure as power minister between 1996 and 1998.        
	The CBI, which found several irregularities in the manner the deal was signed, has named Vijayan as the ninth accused. It has alleged that the deal caused heavy losses to the state exchequer.        
	Lavalin was given the contract to renovate three hydro-electric plants. A state panel had recommended that the job be given to public-sector company Bhel.        
	Todays petition was filed well before September 24, when Vijayan has to appear before the special court to receive the chargesheet.

                                                                                                               Yamaha puts Kasab amp; Pak in same boat
          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                                               Kasab      
	Mumbai, Aug. 13: The dinghy that carried the 26/11 gunmen to Mumbai was powered by a motor the Yamaha Motor Corporation had sold to a Lahore-based firm, a Yamaha employee today told the court that is trying Ajmal Kasab.        
	The deposition, linking the gunmen to Pakistan, comes a day after US investigative agency FBI confirmed in the court that the GPS devices used by the terrorists showed they had set off from Karachi.        
	The Yamaha senior product specialist, whose identity is being kept confidential, spoke from the Los Angeles FBI office to judge M.L. Tahilyani through video-conferencing.        
	He said the outboard machine (motor) bore a unique serial number on the motor bracket, and its last seven digits were inscribed on the engine. The outboard machine was manufactured in Japan and was shipped to the Karachi sea port from Japan, said the witness, who works at Yamahas US headquarters in Cypress, California.        
	When prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam asked him to which country the outboard motor (OBM) with the serial No. 1020015 had been exported, to whom and on which date, the official said: That OBM was exported to Business and Engineering Trends, Lahore, in Pakistan on January 20, 2008.        
	The 10 gunmen are believed to have sailed on a Pakistani ship, Al Husseini, from Karachi. In mid-sea, they allegedly hijacked an Indian fishing trawler, MV Kuber, and travelled to within 12 nautical miles of the Indian coast. They used the inflatable dinghy to land near Fishermens Colony in Mumbai.        
	The Yamaha official said the signature on the agreement paper between the Lahore company and Yamaha appeared to be that of his colleague, Michelle, an assistant services manager in Yamahas Japan office. The payment for the motor was made in Japan.        
	Defence lawyer Abbas Kazmi objected to the agreement letter displayed by Nikam arguing it did not bear the witnesss signature. The judge accepted the document and said its value as evidence could be argued later during the trial.        
	This was the first instance of a foreigner deposing through video-conferencing in an Indian terror trial. Three LCD screens were installed in the courtroom. Before the deposition, one of the four FBI agents present in court identified the witness.        
	Normally, the court begins proceedings at 11am but Nikam had requested it to start proceedings at 10.15am today keeping in mind the time difference with the US.        
	During cross-examination, the witness said Yamahas US head office had no role in the transaction of the motor as it was exported from Japan.        
	Nikam later said a Nokia representative in the US was likely to testify on the purchase and use of mobiles by the gunmen. A representative of New Jersey-based Callphonex Internet Telephony is likely to depose on Monday.

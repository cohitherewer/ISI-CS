          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Raipur, June 24: In rebel-hit regions of Chhattisgarh, persons working under NREGS will receive cash, instead of wage deposits in banks or post offices.         
	The state rural development ministry has decided to relax norms to facilitate payment in the red zones where neither banks nor post offices exist due to rebel terror.         
	According to National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA), a workers payment is deposited in an account in banks or post offices. In Maoist-hit areas, the government has avoided setting up banks or post offices that has created problems for agencies disbursing payment.         
	The state government had earlier sent a proposal to the Centre seeking relaxation in norms. The government had said that works under the NREGS was getting affected and the workers, too, were not receiving timely payment.         
	The rural development and panchayati raj ministries have agreed to the idea of cash payment in rebel-hit areas, said a senior government official. The practice will be started on an experimental basis in limited areas and will be extend if successful. The scheme will start in three blocks of Dantewada and Bastar.         
	To maintain transparency, officials and employees disbursing payment have been instructed to video-graph the entire process.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Chargesheet before birthday
                                                                                                               Chargesheet before birthday
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mayavati                                  
	Lucknow, Jan. 3: Uttar Pradesh police today filed a chargesheet against ruling party legislator Shekhar Tiwari and nine others as the BSP government moved fast to defuse the controversy over the murder of engineer M.K. Gupta.        
	The action came a day after a senior police officer said Tiwari had confessed to his involvement in the killing in Auraiya last month for Guptas refusal to contribute Rs 50 lakh for chief minister Mayavatis birthday celebrations.        
	Sources said Mayavati  who has refused a CBI probe and claims MLAs, MPs and ministers were not told to collect donations  wanted the controversy to die down before January 15, her birthday, and to show that her administration was capable of nailing the guilty.        
	State police chief Vikram Singh told reporters Tiwari and nine others accused in the December 24 murder had been chargesheeted.        
	Of the 10, six including Tiwari have already been arrested, Singh said.        
	The DGP said several other accused like Yogendra Dohore alias Bhatia, who heads the Auraiya BSP unit, and dismissed Dibiyapur station house officer Hoshiyaar Singh, alleged to be close to Tiwari and who had refused to register an FIR, had not been arrested yet.        
	But the law will catch up with them, the police chief said. We want to ensure speedy justice. Hence the trial will also take place expeditiously.        
	Mayavatis political rivals, however, smelt a rat in the quick police action. Trial in a hurry and chargesheet without proper investigation are passports to acquittal, said Samajwadi Party state president Shivpal Singh Yadav.        
	Guptas family remained adamant on a CBI probe. We asked for a CBI probe for a fair investigation. We still want that, his son Pratish said.        
	Police sources said murder and conspiracy charges had been slapped on the accused and the Gangsters Act and the National Security Act invoked to strengthen the chargesheet.        
	The police have already declared a reward of Rs 2,500 on Dohore. Attachment procedures and reward announcement on Hoshiyaar Singh is being worked out. The background of every accused has been thoroughly investigated, Singh said.         
	The DGP said the accused, all of them drunk, had barged into the PWD engineers house around 2 in the night and took him away after locking his wife in a bathroom.        
	Gupta, 48, was taken to a guesthouse, beaten mercilessly and given four electric shocks, Singh said. After he collapsed, the officer added, the MLA and his men dumped Gupta in front of Dibiyapur police station around 4.30am.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Talent doesnt need indecent pay
                                                                                                               Talent doesnt need indecent pay
          SANJAY K. JHA                           Salman Khursheed                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 6: Corporate affairs minister Salman Khursheed, who has triggered a debate on salaries of CEOs, has contested suggestions that a cap on pay would obstruct the reverse brain drain that was attracting talent back to the country.        
	In an exclusive interview, Khursheed hinted that the government would accept a cap on CEO salaries if a standing committee made such a recommendation, though remaining non-committal as he did not want to pre-judge the parliamentary panels opinion.        
	Excerpts from the interview:         
	Q: Your statements on CEO salaries have generated much heat. Does the government want to regulate salaries or does it prefer a hands-off policy?         
	A: I havent changed anything and dont understand who wants to show there is confrontation. There cant be a hands-off policy. The existing law says you cant take more than a certain per cent of the profit. We need to discuss what should be the law tomorrow. Thats all I say. Those who say we want to control must explain why, in that case, we have sent a draft legislation which has no cap.         
	Q: Will the government concede if the standing committee studying the draft legislation suggests a cap?         
	A: No hypothetical question, please. I cannot pre-judge what the parliamentary committee will say. Although the committees recommendation is not binding on the government, standing committees are like mini-Parliament. The MPs want the government to endorse (such a) committees recommendations. If I say that I will reject or accept the committees findings, that will be unfair. I can say that its suggestions are going to be of exceptional persuasive value.         
	Q: You are already indicating that you favour a cap. You describe the salaries vulgar, isnt that clear enough?         
	A: I didnt use the word vulgar. The media asked me about vulgar salaries and I said vulgarity cannot be a fundamental right. This is part of the idiomatic jargon of a particular sector. You rarely say exorbitant salary in corporate language. You say vulgar. Like in legal parlance, you call a judgement perverse thats a stronger expression.         
	Q: The US President uses words like greed. But you are hesitating in calling CEO salaries vulgar. Have the pressures of free market become more intense in a poor country like India?         
	A: Greed is, of course, a much stronger word used by (Barack) Obama. But the reason is not market pressure. It is a matter of language. For me, social responsibility is part of the market. In my definition, market includes this. Conscionable behaviour is a necessary ingredient of freedom. The government will try to create an optimal platform of freedom which benefits everybody, without overlooking the priorities of aam aadmi. And these priorities have been decided against the backdrop of the Congress partys principle of austerity.         
	Q: This debate has come along with the information that India is ranked 134th in the global human development index. The salary debate revolves around global competition and brain drain. Do you find this insensitive?        
	A: What I said was a reminder to our patrons of industry that let us all be austere and contribute to the larger cause. A call for simple living cannot be out of place or uncalled for in a country like India. But I dont think the corporate houses are insensitive to the social realities.         
	There are outstanding examples of industry willing to walk the extra mile for corporate social responsibility. But social responsibility is not only carbon credit, environment protection and opening colleges and hospitals. In India, it also has something to do with austerity.         
	Q: Then why are fears of government control expressed?        
	A: That doesnt worry me. Amartya Sen said we are argumentative Indians. Zest to argue and oppose is not bad in a democracy. The words are not important, the ideas are. The spirit is. What I want to know is is this a matter that cannot be debated? Discussions will take place in Parliament when the bill is brought. There should be discussions outside Parliament, too.         
	Q: Are you suggesting the fears of government control are unfounded?         
	A: Of course. I want an open debate. I want to demystify corporate governance. I talked of shareholder democracy because the shareholders should make an informed decision whether their CEO deserves that kind of salary or not. I am for participatory regulation. There is nothing hands-off. There is either self-regulation or mutually agreed regulation or acceptable regulation by the government.        
	Huge salaries are perfectly legal in some cases. Even a Rs 25-30 crore salary is legal... not even one per cent of the profit. There are persons who take much less than they deserve. But there are many who are taking Rs 2-3 crore but not making profits.         
	I want to know whether the shareholders have a right to know this or not. I want the government to have a clear principle on this; the industry should clearly know what is right and what is wrong. I am trying to open the door of the cage to let the bird fly. To give the bird an opportunity to escape from the cage. The bird says you want to kill me.         
	Q: What happens when the best talent is available at a lower salary?         
	A: This is wrong to say the reverse brain drain will stop if only decent salaries are offered. This is wrong that all talented persons want indecent salaries. They are coming to India for more than salaries. And they can continue coming to India. I assure you no government control is being planned.

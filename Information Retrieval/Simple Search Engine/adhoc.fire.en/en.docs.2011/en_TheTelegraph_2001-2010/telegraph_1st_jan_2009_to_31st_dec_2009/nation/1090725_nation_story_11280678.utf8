The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sabharwal son faces 12-hour murder quiz 
                                                                                                               Sabharwal son faces 12-hour murder quiz 
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                            Parminders father Rajkumar Singh and (below) Himanshu in Delhi on Friday. (Prem Singh)                                 
	New Delhi, July 24: The son of professor H.S. Sabharwal who is battling to bring his fathers killers to justice was detained and questioned for 12 hours today after one of his employees was found stabbed to death last night.        
	Police summoned and interrogated Himanshu Sabharwal, a man in his late 20s, from 4am after the body of Parminder Singh, 30, was found with half-a-dozen stab wounds.        
	Police sources said Parminders wife had alleged that her husband and Himanshu were locked in a love triangle over Pooja, a journalist, who had met both the men last evening on Delhi Universitys north campus.        
	Pooja and Himanshu have denied a relationship, saying they met just two days ago. They said Parminder had met Pooja for the first time the evening before his death.        
	We are investigating all angles, including personal enmity, deputy commissioner (north) S.P. Hooda said.        
	The police sources said and Himanshus lawyer Joginder Tulli confirmed  that Himanshu was the prime suspect in the murder of the chartered accountant who had been working for his filmmaking enterprise, Twos Company, for the past four years.        
	Late at night, however, Himanshu told The Telegraph he wasnt a suspect. He said Parminder must have been killed by the BJP student wing ABVP, whom he accused of beating his father to death in an Ujjain college in 2006.        
	Himanshu has been running a campaign for justice since all six ABVP members accused of killing his father were acquitted on July 13.        
	It was to stick posters announcing a march on Sunday against the acquittals that Himanshu, Pooja and Parminder had gone to the DU campus yesterday. They put up the posters around the campus from 8pm to 11pm with help from Saif Din, SFI secretary from nearby Ramjas College.        
	According to Himanshus police statement, he and Pooja left in his car around 11.10pm, seeing off Saif and Parminder near Khalsa College on the campus. Saif then apparently walked to his hostel while Parminder prepared to head home on his motorbike. But his body was found at the spot a short while later.        
	Officers are also probing possible mugging, which is common in Delhi, but a source said: His wallet, credit cards and watch were intact. Only his mobile phone is missing.        
	Sources said it was also possible that Parminder was murdered elsewhere and dumped near Khalsa College.        
	The police said they had questioned Himanshu, Saif, Pooja and a woman named Garima, who was apparently Himanshus girlfriend and the last person he had called after dropping Pooja home.        
	According to sources, Himanshu told the police: I suspect the people who killed my father are responsible for Parminders death too. Whoever killed him must have seen us leave and then accosted and stabbed him.        
	If he is alleging the ABVP is behind the incident, it is ridiculous, the student unions vice-president Vikas Dahiya said.        
	The police sources said that at 3pm today, officers were preparing to arrest Himanshu and were about to send him for a medical examination.        
	Himanshus lawyer confirmed this. Himanshu was on the verge of being arrested but since the FIR lodged by the police doesnt mention his name (it mentions unknown assailants), I was able to get him out, Tulli said. He was released at 4.30pm. The detainees were all asked to sign an undertaking that they would not leave the city.        
	Parminders father Rajkumar said: This is the first time he was helping put up posters for the campaign. I dont know why he was killed; he wasnt a known face in the Sabharwal case. Parminder was married with a three-year-old daughter.

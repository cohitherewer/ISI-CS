The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CAT firm hints at broader retest 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      CAT firm hints at broader retest 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 7: The service provider for the Common Admission Test to the IIMs today dangled the offer of a possible retest for candidates whose performance was affected by technical glitches that ravaged the test this year.         
	But the service provider, US-based Prometric, did not explain on what basis it would determine which candidates were adversely affected by the glitches  attributed to malware by the IIMs and the firm.         
	In a statement released today, Prometric said it was currently reviewing the experiences of all the candidates that might have been impacted by computer viruses and/or other sources of potential disruption.        
	That assessment is already underway and with the consent of the IIMs, Prometric will be offering a new test to the candidates who were impacted in this way, the statement added.        
	The IIMs and the firm, till today, had only offered a second test opportunity to those candidates who could not attempt the test the first time because of the technical glitches.        
	Todays statement is the first occasion that the CAT organisers have officially indicated a willingness to broaden the ambit of candidates they are willing to test again.        
	But little clarity was available till late evening on exactly how Prometric would try and determine which candidates were affected enough to merit a retest.         
	The software used for the test by Prometric allows it to measure the exact time taken by each candidate to answer a particular question, to complete a particular section of the test and to complete the entire test.        
	This, along with videographed footage of each testing laboratory, could help organisers verify whether a candidate or candidates at a particular centre were disadvantaged, compared to others, company representatives suggested.        
	Over 8,000 candidates could not attempt the test at all over the first four days. A few hundred could not take the test on the subsequent days.        
	But other candidates  officially recorded as having taken the test  have complained of myriad problems that they claim prevented them from a fair attempt.        
	The IIMs said they would review the five-year contract of Prometric in the light of the glitches.

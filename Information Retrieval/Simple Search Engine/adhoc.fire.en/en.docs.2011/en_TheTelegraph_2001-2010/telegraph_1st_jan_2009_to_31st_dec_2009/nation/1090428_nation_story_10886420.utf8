          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chandigarh, April 27: A doctor who suspected his wife of having an affair with her cousin chopped off one of her hands after cutting off an arm of the alleged paramour.        
	Thirty-year-old Gursahib Singh, who had married Kulbir, 22, just six months back, threw the severed arms away in a garbage dump on Saturday.        
	Police today found the decayed arms. Kulbirs wedding bangles were still on her severed limb.         
	On Saturday, Gursahib had called Manpreet, the cousin, to an open area near his house for a booze session along with two of the doctors relatives. Once Manpreet got drunk, the three got into a fight with him during which they chopped off his arm using a large knife, the police said.         
	Gursahib then went back to his house in Patti, about 40km from Amritsar, beat up Kulbir and severed her arm, too, using the same knife.        
	We have arrested the doctor and two of his relatives. The limbs were thrown into a garbage dump. They have been recovered, superintendent of police M.S. Sidhu said.        
	A police officer probing the case said: Kulbirs relatives have alleged that Gursahib was seeking more dowry.         
	Gursahib, a general physician, claimed he had proof that Kulbir was in a relationship with Manpreet. We are looking into both allegations, the officer said.         
	The doctor is believed to have given the police transcripts of telephone conversations between Kulbir and Manpreet that he had recorded. He also told the police he took the extreme step after catching the two together.        
	Doctors said Kulbir and Manpreet would have to live with one hand now as their severed arms had decayed. Had the hands been recovered within six hours of being chopped off, something could have been done, they said.

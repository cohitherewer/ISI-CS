The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sonia three-tier command in place
                                                                                                               Sonia three-tier command in place
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Sonia Gandhi                                  
	New Delhi, June 26: Sonia Gandhi has quietly structured the Congresss leadership at various tiers even as rival BJP is still in the throes of creating its command chain.        
	The layers put in place by the Congress president have members in their seventies and late sixties at the top; the aspiring 20 and 30-plusses are in the third rung.         
	Squeezed in the second tier are those on the right side of 60 and upwards of 50. They are likely to have a shot at top posts in the government if the Congress retains power in the next election.        
	Apart from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the first rung includes Pranab Mukherjee, A.K. Antony, S.M. Krishna, Sushil Kumar Shinde and M. Veerappa Moily, with a considerably younger P. Chidambaram sharing the honours.        
	Come 2014, when the next election is due, Singh will be 77 and the rest, barring Chidambaram, just a few years younger.        
	That is when the Congress will have to grapple with the issue agonising the BJP now: will the geriatrics make way for the second generation or will they leverage their sagacity to stay on? The jury is out.        
	Soniaji lays a lot of premium on age, experience and wisdom. She might not do anything drastic , a source said.         
	But others in the party see the almost imperceptible fading away of seniors like Arjun Singh, H.R. Bhardwaj, Shivraj Patil and Sis Ram Ola as a sign of things to come. Sonia style: subtle, but sure, one leader said.        
	Conversely, it was argued that while this quartet was dispensable as they didnt add value, shaking off Manmohan or Mukherjee would be far tougher.        
	Not that the second generation is found wanting in leaders, experience, regional and caste representations and credibility. The Congress president will be spoilt for choice, a source said.        
	Chidambaram, Kamal Nath, Kapil Sibal, Digvijay Singh (his 10-year self-enforced sanyaas from electoral politics will be over by 2014), Ghulam Nabi Azad and Salman Khursheed are slotted as potential occupants of the jobs that matter on Raisina Hill.        
	Not far behind are Vilasrao Deshmukh, Anand Sharma, Mukul Wasnik, Jairam Ramesh and Prithviraj Chavan.        
	In the Congresss scheme, Manmohan, Mukherjee and Chidambaram constitute the triumvirate that runs the system and insulates it from the accidents and transgressions that may beset a re-elected government.        
	However, sources made it clear that Sonias talent hunt didnt stop in Delhi. They said she was just as keen to foster and promote proven talents from the states.         
	On top of the radar was the twice-successful Andhra chief minister Y.S.R. Reddy, who not only staved off the combined TDP-TRS-Left challenge but also silenced his detractors in the Congress.         
	Others who could make the cut were Bhupinder Singh Hooda  provided he delivers Haryana back in the next election  and Ramesh Chennithala, a prospective chief ministerial candidate in Kerala.        
	Scroll downwards to the third division in the hierarchy and it is mostly Rahul Gandhis chosen nominees. They include members of the baba brigade: Jyotiraditya Scindia, Sachin Pilot, Sandeep Dikshit, Jitin Prasada and R.P.N. Singh.         
	It also has Rahuls political aides Meenakshi Natarajan, Jitendra Singh, Ashok Tanwar and Pradeep Jain.        
	Presiding over as the eminence grise is Sonia, who will be 68 five years from now, just a year older than Chidambaram.

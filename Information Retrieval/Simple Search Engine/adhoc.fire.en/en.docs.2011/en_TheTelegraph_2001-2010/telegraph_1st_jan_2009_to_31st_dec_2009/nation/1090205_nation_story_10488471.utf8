The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mumbai to Obama, Narayanan clarifies
                                                                                                               Mumbai to Obama, Narayanan clarifies
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Mukherjee, Narayanan: Standing together?                                
	New Delhi, Feb. 4: National security adviser M.K. Narayanan has clarified some of his statements on Pakistan to put at rest suggestions of a brewing discord with foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee.        
	After Narayanans interview to a TV news channel last Saturday, it had appeared as though he and Mukherjee were not on the same page on Islamabads response to the November 26 Mumbai attacks.        
	Narayanan also tried to clear the air on remarks he made about US President Barack Obama after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh conveyed how upset he was, government sources said.        
	Asked if Delhi was nervous about Obamas predilection to link the fight against the Taliban and al Qaida to a solution to Kashmir, he had said: But I do think we can make President Obama understand, if he does nurse any such view, that hes barking up the wrong tree.        
	Singh had objected to the use of the phrase barking up the wrong tree.        
	Sources said Mukherjee had indicated his pique to one of Sonia Gandhis aides, who informed her as well as Singh.        
	In his statement, Narayanan said his replies were to specific queries by the interviewer.        
	It is further clarified that the underlying theme of the reply to the question on Indo-US relations was the high expectation India had from the Obama administration with a hope being expressed that it would be possible for India to make the new administration appreciate Indias positions and views in the region, including Kashmir.        
	Similarly, the reference to the situation in Pakistan and the role of the former President (Pervez) Musharraf were also made in the context of specific questions put by the interviewer. Selective quotes taken out of context from the detailed answers have tended to give a distorted idea of what was actually said.        
	CNN-IBN, the channel that telecast his interview, said there was no distortion.        
	Last Saturday, Narayanan had said Pakistan appeared to be taking things seriously on the Mumbai probe and at least they are proceeding in a manner that one would expect an investigative agency to proceed.        
	He added: So as far as we are concerned, we believe that Pakistan is making an attempt to arrive at the truth.        
	Yesterday, Mukherjee said India had received no official communication from Islamabad about the progress of the investigations conducted by them.        
	He said Narayanan had said what he did in his own way and Pakistan had only confirmed getting the dossier.        
	Sources in the Prime Ministers Office said they were foxed by Narayanans interview. They wondered why he had spoken at a time India was building a case globally to show how uncooperative Pakistan was with the terror probe.        
	Sections of the Congress and some UPA allies had felt that, after 26/11, Narayanan should have gone out with Shivraj Patil and Vilasrao Deshmukh.        
	But Singh did not want to upset the ruling order in the PMO.

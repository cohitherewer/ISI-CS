The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Shah gets degree, minus Dr tag
                                                                                                               Shah gets degree, minus Dr tag
          AMIT ROY                      Shah Rukh with his honorary degree in London                          
	London, July 10: Shah Rukh Khan gave one of his best acting roles to date while accepting an honorary degree today in arts and culture from the University of Bedfordshire  though like most Bollywood stars he doesnt understand he cannot actually stick a Dr in front of his name.        
	He was characteristically modest, funny and serious when giving his acceptance speech at the ceremony held at the Indian-owned Washington Hotel in Londons Mayfair.        
	Looking fetching in academic robes and cap, which he intends to keep, he recalled what his father had once told him: Education is not a preparation for life but is life itself.        
	He apologised for being not being to travel to the universitys campus, either in Luton or Bedford, because he was still troubled by his shoulder injury. But he promised to help Bedfordshire University students in any way that he could, though he dismissed notions of a Shah Rukh Khan chair in Indian cinema as premature and presumptuous.        
	At this point, the universitys vice-chancellor, Les Ebden, cut to announce that if anyone were to offer an endowment to enable such a chair to be set up, he would warmly shake the hand of such a person.        
	The citation was read out by the universitys deputy vice-chancellor, Ashraf Jawaid, who said Shah Rukh was being honoured in recognition of his exceptional achievement as a film actor and producer.        
	Shah Rukh was nominated by Roots2Roots, an India-based NGO which seeks to improve relations between India and Pakistan and other ASEAN states. (An emotional Pakistani woman journalist later told him he was loved in Pakistan and he was welcome there any time.)        
	Jawaid listed some of Shah Rukhs blockbuster successes, among them Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Chak De India and Om Shanti Om.         
	It is in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the arts, culture and media that the award of Honorary Degree in Arts and Culture goes to Shah Rukh Khan today, he said, inviting the actor to address leading members of Indian society in London.        
	Shah Rukh made a special point of greeting the artist M.F. Husain, seated in the front row, who still feels it is not safe for him to return to India.        
	I could not believe I may be addressed as a doctor from henceforth, he began, which suggests he does not understand the status of an honorary degree.        
	He added a little joke: My kids have asked me if I will be getting a stethoscope.        
	But he made a number of solemn pledges.         
	It makes me think seriously about what I do and what I have done over the past 20 years in my career. The feeling I get is that I should utilise this recognition to further the cause of those underprivileged children who do not get the opportunity to educate themselves. I promise to dedicate a large proportion of my time to do whatever is (in) my capacity to further the cause of education amongst these kids as a way of expressing my thankfulness and gratitude for this honour  starting with my kids who are highly uneducated.

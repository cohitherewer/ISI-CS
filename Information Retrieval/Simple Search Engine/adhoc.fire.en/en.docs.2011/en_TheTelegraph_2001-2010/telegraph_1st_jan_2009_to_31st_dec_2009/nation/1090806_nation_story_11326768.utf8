The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pay hike protest, the IIT way 
                                                                                                               Pay hike protest, the IIT way 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 5: Veteran IIT Kharagpur cryogenics professor Kanchan Chowdhury will report to laboratories and classes as usual tomorrow  but wearing a black badge of protest on his shirt pocket.        
	Demanding  as he puts it  respect.         
	Around 3,000 faculty members across the Indian Institutes of Technology are expected to wear black badges at work tomorrow in a rare public display of frustration at repeated delays in promised salary hikes.        
	A government panel under the former Indian Institute of Science director, Goverdhan Mehta, recommended a raise for the faculty at apex technical institutions like the IITs and the IIMs in early February.        
	But six months later, the government is yet to approve any hike in teacher pay at these institutes.        
	It isnt about the money. I chose teaching at the IITs even though my classmates and juniors are earning much more in the corporate sector. This is about the respect we deserve, said Chowdhury, who has taught at IIT Kharagpur for a quarter of a century.        
	Indias premier engineering schools have faced an increasing shortage in faculty for over five years now, with better-paying industry luring away some of the best brains in the country.         
	But the sharpest jump in workload for those who teach at the institutes came last year, when the Centre decided to open eight new IITs and enforced an expansion in student intake to introduce OBC quotas.        
	Suddenly, teachers at the seven older IITs were expected to take more classes, tutorials and laboratory sessions, and even travel to sites hosting temporary campuses of the new IITs.        
	 The nation needs to decide whether by overburdening us without any recognition, it wants the IITs to become like any other higher educational institution. Or, do we want to retain the excellence associated with the IITs, asked Chowdhury.        
	But even in their protest tomorrow, the IIT faculty will show what makes them different from teachers at several other Indian universities.        
	On August 1, the All India IIT Faculty Federation  the conglomeration of bodies representing teachers at each IIT  met at IIT Delhi and decided on the protest against the delay in their pay hike.        
	Minutes of that meeting show that apart from wearing black badges, the federation resolved to take recourse to other expressions of protest such as mass casual leave.        
	But three IIT directors, who requested not to be named, independently confirmed that their faculty had collectively decided to take all their classes, tutorials and laboratory sessions and register a casual leave as protest.        
	Effectively, teachers will take all their classes, do all their academic work... and in protest demand that one of their holidays be struck off. That, I guess is the IIT way, one of the directors said.

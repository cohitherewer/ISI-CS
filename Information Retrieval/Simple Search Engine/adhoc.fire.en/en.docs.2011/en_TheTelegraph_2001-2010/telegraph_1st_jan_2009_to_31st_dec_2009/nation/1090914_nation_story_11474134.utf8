                                                                                                               Case ordeal plagues ex-staff
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Sept. 13: For many, criminal proceedings in disproportionate assets cases have turned to be an unending nightmare.        
	Take 73-year-old Subash Chandra Das for instance. Nineteen years ago when Das was the Idco chief general manager at Bhubaneswar, vigilance officers raided his residence. A criminal case was registered against him in March 20, 1990, under Prevention of Corruption Act. A chargesheet was filed in the same year. His case is pending trial till date.        
	For Sarat Kumar Mohanty, 72, the ordeal was no less. Thirteen years ago, when Mohanty was the deputy director of agriculture, land and water management in Bhadrak, vigilance officers raided his home. A year later, a criminal case was registered against him in 1994 under the Prevention of Corruption Act, but the chargesheet was filed in 1998. His trial is still on. Finding no way out of this torment, retired bureaucrats filed petitions in Orissa High Court seeking intervention against the infringement on their right to speedy trial guaranteed by the Article 21 of the Constitution, or quash the criminal proceedings.         
	Ironically, Orissa Special Courts Act-1990 was formulated with the avowed purpose of speedy trial of corrupt politicians and bureaucrats and was enforced by the Biju Patnaik government (1990-95) in July 1992. The Congress government headed by J.B. Patnaik after coming to power, however, repealed it in August 1995.        
	Nearly 12 years later, Naveen Patnaik resurrected the repealed act with necessary modifications and consequently the Orissa Special Courts Act-2006 was born in 2007. In his PIL, Das has labelled the act a draconian piece of legislation and a whipping lash in the hands of the powers that be. A case was initiated against him before a special judge (vigilance) in Bhubaneswar. Later, the case was registered as a special court case (number-3) under the Special Court Act.         
	In 1995, it was sent back to Special Judge (vigilance) in Bhubaneswar when the act was repealed. But after re-enactment of the Special Courts Act in 2007, the home department transferred the case back to the special court in Bhubaneswar through a notification filed in November 2008.        
	Mohanty on the other hand had filed a PIL alleging that the Special Courts Act runs contrary to the rule of law and is against principles and tenets of democracy.         
	State vigilance bureau officials said though nearly 300 cases are registered on an average every year, chargesheets are filed in 70 per cent of the cases.         
	Officials conceded that only 30 per cent of them are disposed, while 12 per cent receive no results due to several reasons  death of the accused or when investigation agencies or witnesses lose interest.        
	If the present disposal rate is any indication, it would take another 20 years to clear the backlog, if no more cases are registered, said a senior vigilance officer.

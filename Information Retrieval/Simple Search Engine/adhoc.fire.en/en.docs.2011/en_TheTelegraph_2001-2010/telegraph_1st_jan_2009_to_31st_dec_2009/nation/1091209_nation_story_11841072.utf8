The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Copenhagen  Day 2 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Copenhagen  Day 2

	Choose your path        
	Two mock gateways set up by environmental campaigners  a fiery red one symbolising the perils of climate change and a green one representing an international climate accord to address it  greeted delegates as they filed into a conference centre in Copenhagen.        
	Political deals and global warming this way, the advocates shouted as they beckoned the delegates towards the inverted U-shaped red gate. Placards at the entrance to the green one read: Binding Deal for a Safe Future.         
	The delegates, who had first passed under a giant wind turbine blade, were not required to go through the gates, set up by the Worldwide Fund for Nature. But some chose to: one man jokingly did the limbo all the way through the red hellfire passage.        
	Judgement day        
	Dante or Michelangelo might have sniffed at the text and the visuals. But evocations of Judgement Day were a consistent undercurrent in speeches and conference materials, where representatives of about 200 nations hope to hammer out the details of an international climate accord. To help establish the mood, the choreographers of the meeting screened a short film. In one scene, a young girl awakens to a grim inheritance should negotiators leave the meeting empty-handed: a scorched earth, menacing storms and an all-swallowing sea. Please, the girl says to the camera as violins rise to a crescendo, help the world.        
	Order order        
	As the plenary session moved from harp and trumpet music to administrative details, Connie Hedegaard, the Danish minister presiding over the conference, was clearly fearing a long series of long-winded speeches. Be brief, she beseeched the participants, and keep things moving. Perhaps predictably, few listened. Kevin Conrad, a representative of Papua New Guinea known for admonishing the US for slowing things down at negotiations in Bali in 2007, interrupted what was supposed to be a procedural nicety, the reading of the rules. He said he disagreed with the rules and wanted to make a change. Hedegaard encouraged him to delay consideration of the issue. But he doggedly pressed his buzzer again, asking when she would hear him out. Hedegaard finally yielded. Later this week, she said.

	The US Environmental Protection Agency on Monday cleared the way for regulation of greenhouse gases without new laws passed by Congress, reflecting President Barack Obamas commitment to act on climate change. The EPA ruling that greenhouse gases endanger human health will allow the agency to regulate planet-warming gases even without legislation in Congress.        
	Dubious honour        
	Last evening, it was time for the announcement of the Fossil of the Day awards. Since 1999, that dubious honour has been doled out each day at annual climate talks  to the country judged to have made the most outstanding effort to block progress in negotiations. Canada had come in third. Second place went to Finland, Austria and Sweden. First place went to all the industrialised countries for collectively showing up in Copenhagen with too low an ambition level to cut carbon and prevent catastrophic climate change.

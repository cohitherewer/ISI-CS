The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Kashmir part of India: EU 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Kashmir part of India: EU 
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Srinagar, Nov. 24: Pakistan today suffered a setback with European Union diplomats saying Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India.        
	The EU delegation has been visiting Kashmir for several years but this is the first time it has come so close to the Indian position.        
	Asked if the bloc considers Kashmir an integral part of India, Lars-Olof Lindgren, the Swedish ambassador who led the five-member fact-finding team to Srinagar, said: That is the opinion of the European Union. That is our opinion and that is the starting point of the discussion.        
	The pro-India statement by the EU delegation came on the lawns of Hurriyat chief Mirwaiz Umar Farooqs home.        
	Mirwaiz, though, played down the statement later, saying this was not the official policy of EU. They are the EU ambassadors based in India. The fact is that EU considers Kashmir a dispute and the reason the delegation is here is a clear proof of that, he said.

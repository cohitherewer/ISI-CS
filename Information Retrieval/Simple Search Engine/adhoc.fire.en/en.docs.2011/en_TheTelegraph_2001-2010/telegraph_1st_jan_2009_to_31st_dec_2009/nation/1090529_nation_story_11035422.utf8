                                                                                                               Chance for Farooq to renew energy
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, May 28: A rude joke began circulating shortly after the swearing-in this afternoon  non-conventional energy, or new and renewable energy, for Dr Farooq Abdullah.        
	What a fitting charge for the man for all seasons from Kashmir  where would you get such an energetic, non-conventional man as him?         
	Hah! a top Peoples Democratic Party adversary cackled over the phone from Srinagar. What a left-handed gift to him! But is that true? Farooq had done enough non-conventional things so he has probably been picked for the right job.        
	The sarcasm of tone was too loaded to miss, but too true to deny. At 48, in 1984, Farooq lost his government in Kashmir in the most unique circumstances  brother-in-law (the late) Gul Shah was pulling the rug from under him with Arun Nehrus assistance in Srinagar while he was biking down from Gulmarg, a Bollywood actress on his pillion.        
	At 73 today, he doesnt require too much persuasion to hit the nearest discotheque.         
	Its doubtful, though, whether theres too much dance and song in the Abdullah household tonight over the task the Prime Minister has handed him. Farooq had publicly pitched for health  which, to add injury to insult, has gone to fellow Kashmiri Ghulam Nabi Azad  saying he could bring his education in medicine to matter at a national level.        
	He was rumoured to be headed for culture and tourism, a stage he may actually have revelled on for the opportunities it offers Kashmir and to him personally; it has gone to a relative rookie, cabinet entrant Kumari Selja.        
	Most would reckon that in todays world, energy  non-conventional, renewable energy  is a big-ticket issue, a serious brief central to political debate in capitals such as Washington, Brussels, Beijing, Tokyo and London. Kashmir itself suffers a serious energy crisis winter after long winter.        
	But therein may lie part of the problem  a serious brief may not suit Farooqs style and temperament; it may leave him cramped, with too much reading and paperwork.        
	But should he defy his image and get down to that, therell be another occasion to raise three loud cheers for the man of forever-renewable energy.

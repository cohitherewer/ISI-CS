The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | History? Yes; homework? No
                                                                                                               History? Yes; homework? No
          SANJAY K JHA                           Savarkar: Poll plank?                                  
	New Delhi, July 8: The BJP remembers its Veer Savarkar history but has forgotten an inconvenient footnote to the more recent Atal Bihari Vajpayee government.        
	The main Opposition party today rolled out its heavy artillery in the Lok Sabha to demand an explanation from the government on why it was not giving consent to a proposal to install a memorial to Vinayak (Veer) Savarkar in the French city of Marseilles despite the local mayors approval.        
	The BJPs opponents smelt an attempt to raise an issue that some feel will find resonance in Maharashtra in the run-up to the Assembly elections a few months away.        
	However, the partys deputy leader in the Lok Sabha, Sushma Swaraj, dug into history books and came up with a topical justification for the demand.        
	She said July 8 marked the centenary of Savarkars escape from a British ship, which had docked near Marseilles, when he was being brought to India after being arrested in London for anti-British activities. Savarkar swam to the shore but was re-arrested in Marseilles, brought to India and imprisoned.        
	Sushma did display her grasp over history but forgot something closer to the present.        
	None of the BJP leaders, including L.K. Advani who found the topic important enough to warrant his intervention to seek a response from the government after the partys Maharashtra leader Gopinath Munde raised it, mentioned that the mayors letter from Marseilles was written in 1998.        
	The BJP was in power then. The Atal Bihari Vajpayee government returned to office in 1999 to rule the country for the next five years. For some reason, the consent the BJP is now fighting for was not given by the Vajpayee government for six long years.         
	The letter to the Government of India (with a copy sent to the Veer Savarkar Trust) was written by Marseilles mayor Jean-Claude Gaudin on July 1, 1998. Gaudin happens to be the mayor even now.        
	Sources said the leadership was not properly briefed on the history of the letter and hence, Advani and Sushma got involved in the matter. The Maharashtra BJP is already fuming at the Centres decision to name the Mumbai sea link after Rajiv Gandhi, not Savarkar as the party wanted.         
	The government was taken aback by the sudden thrust by the main Opposition party. The minister of state for parliamentary affairs, V. Narayanswamy, promised to get back to the House later as the government had not taken note of the matter so far.

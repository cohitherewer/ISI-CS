	Patna, June 11: The body of missing JD(U) leader, Satyendra Singh, was recovered 2.5km from Gandhi setu downstream near Gulli ghat under Khajekala police station area, reports our correspondent.        
	The body was identified by the brother of the deceased, who recognised the make of the trousers that Satyendra was last seen wearing. The JD(U) leader, who was also into transport business, had been missing for two weeks. Police suspect political rivalry behind the murder.

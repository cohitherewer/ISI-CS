The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Plane crash averted
                                                                                                               Plane crash averted
                            
	Mumbai, Aug. 23 (PTI): Two private jets took off from the same runway at the same time at Mumbai airport today, nearly causing a crash.        
	How the catastrophe was averted is not clear. An official of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation said the air traffic control cleared both pilots to take off from runway 27 at 11.30am.         
	One plane was a chartered aircraft called Challenger from Bermuda. The other belonged to an Indian company. One plane was headed for Aurangabad, the other was going to Delhi. It is not known how many passengers were in the two planes, both of which had non-scheduled operator permits.         
	This is the second time in three months that a near crash at Mumbai airport has been averted. On May 31, two planes got take-off clearance at the same time from two runways but the pilots stopped the planes in the nick of time.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | WHOS GOT THE LOOK
                                                                                                               WHOS GOT THE LOOK
          'Designer Kiran Uttam Ghosh picked for The Telegraph the most fashionable candidates in Election 2009. She also chose three of the most visible politicians who could do with a change of wardrobe. Fashion is like politics. Its moody, mercenary and relentlessly   full of mirages, says Kiran

	Unstressed luxury is a phrase that comes to mind when Im describing a man I think of as our unflappable representative at the UN. A writer and an aspiring politician, his style is crisp and well put together, be it his impeccably tailored suits or all-white shirt pant made election-friendly with a tiranga stole!

	I cannot but think of him as a suitable boy! He is always very correct with his political dress sense. His white kurta-pyjamas are quite neat and nice. By and large, I think he represents Youngistan quite well

	His is a natty restrained royal style. Crisp bandhgalas are the trademark (that he sometimes brightens with kerchiefs) of this heir

	Known more for her social life, she comes across as comfortable in her own skin. She is really trying to be politically dressed in her printed white and off-white saris, but maybe she could try another shop apart from Anokhi! (And she should be extra careful with her footwear, given the number of times she will end up with it in her mouth!)

	One thinks of fitness when this yesteryear cricketer comes to mind. Maybe as a potential politician he needs to desify his look a bit. Wearing a button-down shirt with raised collars when he met Pervez Musharraf was a serious wardrobe malfunction        
	Rating: 5                                          Omar Abdullah   
	A savvy sharp dresser to match his persona of a canny spokesperson as we all know from his now famous speech on the nuclear deal. Special mention for his super selection of ties  yellow and scarlet  we like!

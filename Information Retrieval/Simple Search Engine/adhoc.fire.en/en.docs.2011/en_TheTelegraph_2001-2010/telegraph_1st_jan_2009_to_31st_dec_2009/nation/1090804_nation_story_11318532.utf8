          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Lucknow, Aug. 3: An Agra trader is fighting for his life after setting himself ablaze today because of alleged police harassment.        
	Sudhir Guptas wife and three-year-old daughter are also in hospital with burn injuries, sustained while trying to save him.        
	Guptas relatives alleged he was being framed in criminal cases as he had not paid protection money to the police. They alleged that the harassment had increased since the police were forced to suspend a constable indicted following a complaint from Gupta early this year.        
	Today, some personnel in plainclothes allegedly broke into Guptas house around 2am, even after being told by his wife that he would go to the police station after dawn.        
	When we refused to open the door, the cops broke open the main gate. Driven by despair, my husband rushed to the roof and poured kerosene and set himself on fire, Guptas wife Rakhi said.        
	The cops watched him burn and didnt take him to hospital, she alleged. Locals came out hearing my cries and rushed him to hospital.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Jaya shoots down BJP talks claim
                                                                                                               Jaya shoots down BJP talks claim
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chennai, April 13: ADMK leader Jayalalithaa today denied her party was holding back-channel talks with the BJP for a post-poll alliance, as claimed by L.K. Advani yesterday.         
	I wish to clarify that such reports are baseless and the AIADMK is not conducting talks with any political party for a post-poll alliance, she said in a statement.        
	Advani, the BJPs prime ministerial candidate, had said yesterday that his party had opened channels with Jayalalithaa to bring her into the NDA.        
	Jayalalithaa also clarified that her party had entered into an alliance only with the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) and the two Left parties, CPM and CPI, indicating that the BJP was not part of any equation at this stage.         
	The ADMK leader had to quickly shoot down Advanis claim since it could have caused confusion among her allies, especially the Left, which is allergic to the BJP, ahead of the third front launching its campaign in Tamil Nadu on Saturday. The state goes to the polls on May 13.         
	The BJP just wants to improve its chances by giving the impression that it can wean away parties from the third front. Since we have fought two elections with the BJP, we became easy target for such speculation, an ADMK MP said.

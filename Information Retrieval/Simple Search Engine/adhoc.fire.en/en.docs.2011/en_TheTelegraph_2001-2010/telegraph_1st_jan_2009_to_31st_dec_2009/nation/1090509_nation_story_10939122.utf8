          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 8: The Supreme Court today directed that counselling and de-addiction centres be set up in all educational institutions to curb ragging.         
	A court-appointed panel last month blamed rampant alcoholism and drug abuse for the spurt in cases of ragging.         
	One of the main reasons for violence on campus is rampant alcoholism and it is recommended that de-addiction measures be introduced in educational institutions, amicus curiae Gopal Subramaniam had said, summing up the report of the R.K. Raghavan committee.        
	A bench headed by Justice Arijit Pasayat, who retired today, accepted the report and directed that all educational institutions set up de-addiction centres to deal with alcoholism-related issues such as aggression and violence. The court also asked all institutions to set up counselling centres to help the perpetrators and the victims of ragging.         
	It is a great judgment. But we have to ensure proper implementation. Unless you ensure implementation, it is meaningless, said Rajendra Kachroo, whose 19-year-old son died after he was ragged.        
	Aman Kachroo was thrashed by four drunken seniors in a Himachal Pradesh medical college and died of his injuries in March.         
	The court today asked all states to submit undertakings that they had complied with its earlier orders on ragging. It also cleared state-level committees to address the problem.         
	The Raghavan panel had said in its April 20 report: There is a dire need to examine the psychological aspects of ragging, including its impact on young students and the rationale behind seniors urge to rag and torment their juniors. It also called for the appointment of a committee of psychologists and mental health experts for the purpose.         
	At the last hearing, the court had dubbed the reports findings as shocking and said: It reflects complete degradation of our value system.         
	In an order on May 16, 2007, the court had made ragging a crime and tasked educational institutions with the responsibility of curbing it.

                                                                                                               Indians hit back
                                  
	Melbourne, Oct. 5 (PTI): Two Australians who allegedly abused a group of Indians and vandalised their car were bashed up last night here.         
	The incident took place at a parking lot outside Meadowglen International Athletics Stadium in Epping when a skateboarder damaged the rear window of a car belonging to one of the Indians.         
	The skateboarder allegedly also abused some Indians who were coming out of the stadium after a kabaddi match.         
	Associates of the people whose car was damaged came to their assistance. Two men were assaulted and hit with sticks in the brawl. These two injured men were from the group, which had allegedly started to verbally abuse the people in the vehicle, police said in a statement.        
	The two men, aged 25 and 42, were taken to a hospital with minor injuries, the statement said. However, no arrests have been made, the statement added.         
	A lot of people were leaving and the presentations (after the match) were on at the time. I spoke to one of the boys who was there and he said a guy had smashed the rear window of a car that was leaving, Darebin councillor Tim Singh, who was present at the presentation ceremony of the tournament, was quoted as saying in media reports.         
	Singh said the Australian also made some racial comments, following which the clash broke out between the two groups.         
	Another police officer, Mark Doney, was quoted as saying the incident occurred when contestants began to leave the venue.         
	The injured have not pressed charges. We dont have a complaint of assault from them, Doney said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Brahmos passes test, ready for army
                                                                                                               Brahmos passes test, ready for army
                            
	New Delhi, March 29 (PTI): The latest land-attack version of the supersonic Brahmos cruise missile with a range of 290km was successfully test-fired for the second time in a month today in Pokhran and is ready for induction in the army.        
	The missile was successfully launched at 11:15 hours in the morning and in two-and-a-half minutes, it hit the bulls eye in the Pokhran firing range in Rajasthan, an official said.        
	This was the third test-firing of the Block II version, which has been developed jointly with Russia and can carry a 300kg conventional warhead.        
	After todays test, officials said the development phase of the Block II version of the missile was over and it was ready for induction in the army. They said the objectives of the test were fulfilled.        
	A version of the Brahmos is already in use by the Indian Navy.        
	During the test, armys director-general of military operations Lieutenant General A.S. Sekhon, artillery school commandant Lt Gen Rao and additional director-general (artillery) Major General V.K. Tiwari were present.        
	The launch was also witnessed by DRDOs chief controller and Brahmos aerospace chairman A. Sivathanu Pillai and DRDL director P. Venugopalan.         
	The missile had hit its target from a distance of around 90km during the second trial on March 4 at the Pokhran test-firing range.        
	In the first test on January 20, the missile, however, failed to hit its target because of glitches in its homing device. The missile had taken off successfully but deviated from its path in mid-course and landed far away from its target.         
	Sources said the defects were rectified at the time of the last test when it went on to hit the target.        
	They said that the unique technology in the Block II missiles made them unparalleled and would help the armed forces hit even insignificant targets hidden in a cluster of buildings.        
	The new seeker is unique and would help us to hit our targets, which are insignificant in terms of size, in a cluster of large buildings. India is now the only nation in the world with this advanced technology, an official claimed.        
	DRDO officials claimed Brahmos would be able to start deliveries of the 240 missiles ordered by the army in two years from now as per the original schedule. The army has already inducted one regiment of the Block I version of the missile.         
	The Indo-Russian company has its headquarters in Delhi.

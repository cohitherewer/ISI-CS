The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP loses stomach for meet
                                                                                                               BJP loses stomach for meet
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              Sushma, Rajnath      
	New Delhi, Oct. 16: For once, a BJP conclave has been put off because there may be too little on the plate. At least in the literal sense.        
	The partys October 28-29 national executive has been postponed indefinitely, apparently because the organisers failed to check if the dining facility would be available at the venue, Parliaments Annexe, for the 100 or so delegates.        
	They were told a couple of days ago that it was already booked and the BJP must arrange for meals outside.        
	However, sources cited another reason for the deferment, saying the meeting might have thrown up more than the party could stomach.        
	There was fear that defeat in the Assembly polls, whose results will be out on October 22, might lead to another round of blood-letting. The party saw direct attacks on the leadership in the session held to take stock of the Lok Sabha poll defeat and in the later chintan baithak in Shimla.        
	The BJP is more worried about questions being asked on Haryana than on Maharashtra, because of the way its Haryana managers, principally Vijay Goel and Sushma Swaraj, have dealt with allies.        
	While the Indian National Lok Dal was dumped after the partnership drew a blank in the Lok Sabha polls, Goel, BJP general secretary in charge of Haryana, briefly flirted with the Haryana Janhit Congress, floated by Bhajan Lals family.        
	He junked them after Lals son Kuldeep Bishnoi asked to be projected as candidate for chief minister. Goel apparently said the BJP should not play second fiddle to regional formations if it was to take on the Congress.        
	Neither party chief Rajnath Singh nor L.K. Advani intervened. BJP sources admit the party missed an opportunity to emerge as the lynchpin of an Opposition coalition that might have put up a fight.        
	Goel, who was close to Atal Bihari Vajpayee when he was the Prime Minister, was inducted by Rajnath as a counterweight against Arun Jaitley, Sushma, M. Venkaiah Naidu and other Advani loyalists.        
	Sources said a loss in Maharashtra would be shameful, especially because the 10-year-old Congress-NCP government hasnt covered itself in glory. They added that while state leaders Gopinath Munde and Nitin Gadkari had done their best, the uncertainty in Delhi continued to demoralise the workers.        
	If we lose, an objective assessment will have to include the Delhi factor, a Maharashtra office-bearer said.        
	Questions may have been raised also on the resignation row around Vasundhara Raje, a special invitee to the meeting. She has yet shown no sign that she wants to quit despite a directive from the top. Sources said that given the erosion of Rajnaths authority, nobody could tell who might raise the issue and set off another controversy.        
	None of the sources had any idea when the national executive might meet. Parliament will convene for six weeks from the first week of November. The sources said the chances of an inter-session meeting seemed remote unless Rajnath was pressured to call one.

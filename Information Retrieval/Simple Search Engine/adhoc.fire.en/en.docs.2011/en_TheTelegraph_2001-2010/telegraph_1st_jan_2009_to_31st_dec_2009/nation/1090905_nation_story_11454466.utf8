The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Forget Oscars, these slumdogs want a world cup 
                                                                                                               Forget Oscars, these slumdogs want a world cup

	Mumbai, Sept. 4: All slumdogs may not turn millionaires, but many do become soccer stars. Pele, Diego Maradona, Zinedine Zidane the list is endless.        
	At 25, Darjeeling youth Vinod Subba cannot hope to emulate them. Still, he is among a bunch of underprivileged young men from across India who have flown to Milan, Italy, in search of their own great soccer dream: to help India shine in the 7th International Homeless Cup.        
	The Indian teams sponsor is Tottenham Hotspur, no less - the club that is now placed second in Englands Barclays Premier League. In addition to financial support, Tottenham will provide kit, signed memorabilia for auction, and coaching advice.        
	The tournament, played annually, began in 2003 to provide the planets homeless a chance to represent their countries and transform their lives for ever.        
	Transformation came to Subba when he arrived in Nagpur in 2002 looking for a job as a watchman and moved into a slum. There, a group of local citizens led by a college sports instructor was looking to wean youths away from drugs with the help of football.        
	My life changed after that, Subba said over the phone on his way to Mumbai airport to catch his flight.        
	This is the third time an Indian team is taking part in the Homeless Cup. The mood is upbeat thanks to Indias Nehru Cup win this week.        
	We ranked 45th among 48 teams in the 2007 tournament in Copenhagen. In 2008, at Melbourne, we finished 39th. We hope to do much better this year, said Vijay Barse, 63, the physical education instructor from Nagpurs Hislop College whose glorious epiphany and call of conscience began it all in 2001. One rainy July afternoon that year, Barse, on his way home from college, had taken shelter under a tree.        
	A bunch of youths from the nearby slums were kicking an empty bucket around and enjoying their own version of soccer. But whatever it was, they showed tremendous skill and control, he recalled.        
	The Krida Vikas Sanstha Nagpur (KVSN) was formed with donations from friends and family. It has reached over 50,000 youths in eight years.        
	Over the past few years we have been holding this national-level tournament with the participation of teams from Bengal, Orissa, Assam, Jharkhand. Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttarakhand and Maharashtra. We hope to have more teams next year, Barse said.        
	The team of 20 for the Homeless Cup was picked from the best talents on show at the KVSN Jhopadpatti Football Tournament. The players were assessed for their off-the-field behaviour as well, said Barses son Abhijeet, professor of zoology and part-time coach of the team.        
	Financing the team has always been an issue. We have had generous donors. Plus, this year the load is off because of Tottenham. They have promised to engage additional support for KVSN from their own partners and supporters, said Abhijeet, who is flying to Milan with the team.        
	We have found a fantastic coach, Ashok Chhetri, who is willing to coach the boys for the next season for a simple honorarium.        
	Tottenham had been drafted in through contacts in international sports marketing company Alexander Ross. KVSN will hold soccer camps in Bengal from November to scout for talent.        
	The Homeless Cup has triggered, and supports, grassroots football projects in 60-odd nations, working with 25,000 homeless people through the year. Seventy-three per cent of the players have come off drugs or alcohol and moved into jobs, or are studying, or have reunited with their families. Some have become players or coaches for professional or semi-professional football teams. The programme includes both males and females.

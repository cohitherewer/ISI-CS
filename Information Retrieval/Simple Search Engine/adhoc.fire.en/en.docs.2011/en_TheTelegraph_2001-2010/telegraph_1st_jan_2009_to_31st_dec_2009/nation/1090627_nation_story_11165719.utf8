The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Dowry message with Friday prayers 
                                                                                                               Dowry message with Friday prayers 
          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, June 26: Muslim religious leaders are planning a nationwide awareness campaign during Friday prayers against dowry and extravagant weddings.        
	Taking the lead in this revolutionary initiative is the revered Islamic seminary Darul Uloom Deoband, which is disturbed by the increasing number of dowry-related deaths among Muslims.        
	Community organisations such as the Jamaat Islami and the Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind too will take part in the campaign.        
	Dowry is a social curse and is against Islamic teachings. Yet it is spreading like an epidemic in Muslim society. We are determined to put an end to it, said Sheikhul Hadees Maulana Talha Peer Ji of the Deoband seminary.        
	We are planning a meeting of ulemas, muftis and intellectuals to contemplate the issue deeply and chart out a (further) plan of action.        
	If the awareness campaign fails to show results, religious leaders may even think of issuing a fatwa against dowry, Mohammad Salim Qasimi of the Darul Uloom Wakf Deoband said.        
	First, we shall try to sensitise the community during the Friday prayers. If that does not work, we shall go in for more serious steps like a fatwa, Qasimi said. Its our religious duty to stop this practice and all of us should work towards it jointly.        
	Qasimi said that demanding dowry was not only a religious evil but also a social evil, and advocated a harsh law against exploitation in the name of dowry.        
	He also criticised the growing tendency among Muslims to splurge on weddings, saying community leaders were considering stricter regulations to make simple marriages the norm.        
	We shall ask all muftis to solemnise marriages in a simple way. Islam likes simplicity. It prohibits adopting practices that pave the way for evil (to enter) society, Qasimi said.        
	Mufti Mukharam of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind agreed that Muslims were increasingly turning their marriages into costly events.        
	An Islamic marriage used to be a simple affair. Now it has been turned into a difficult affair owing to un-Islamic practices like dowry. Extravagant marriages and demanding dowry is contrary to the Shariah, he said.

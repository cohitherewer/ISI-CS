	Guwahati, June 9: A Calcutta businessman kidnapped in Assam 14 days ago today claimed he had walked out of the house where he was being held captive, hitched a ride on a bicycle and hired a car to reach a Guwahati hotel where his wife was waiting with the ransom.         
	Pradip Roy, who heads the engineering firm Pradip Structural Development Private Limited, said he threatened a lone abductor on guard that he would shout and alert villagers if he was not allowed to leave.         
	Roy, who is in his early fifties, was abducted by suspected NDFB militants on his way to a project site in Kokrajhar district on May 27. The outfit had initially demanded Rs 10 crore as ransom from his family, based in Nagerbazar, Calcutta, but scaled it down to Rs 50 lakh.        
	I told him that it was the outfits fault that it was not able to collect the ransom and hence I should no longer be kept hostage. I threatened that if he tried to stop me I would create a ruckus and alert all the villagers. Saying so, I walked out of the house, Roy said, claiming he took his chance today because only one abductor was standing guard.        
	Once out, Roy says he borrowed Rs 50 from a villager and hitched a ride on a bicycle, then boarded a shuttle van and finally hired a car from Mangaldoi, about 68km from Guwahati. The businessman did not reveal how he knew that his wife Aparna was at the hotel.         
	DSP Kokrajhar (headquarters) Mukut Rabha would only say that somehow he knew that his wife was at the hotel.         
	Sources said the abductors had allowed Roy to speak to his wife yesterday.        
	Aparna said the abductors had tried several times since yesterday afternoon to collect the ransom but had changed plans each time, saying police were on their trail. They called this morning to ask her to return to Calcutta, she added.         
	In the meantime, they contacted my husbands aide in Calcutta and told him they would take the payment there, Aparna said.

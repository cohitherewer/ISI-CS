The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Opposition to judge elevation to SC
                                                                                                               Opposition to judge elevation to SC
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 16: Lawyers and jurists were set to meet law minister Veerappa Moily in a bid to block a chief justice accused of corruption from being promoted to the Supreme Court, as another battle brewed in this season of judicial accountability.        
	Karnataka High Court Chief Justice Paul Daniel Dinakaran Premkumar is one of the five state chief justices recently recommended for elevation by the apex court collegium headed by the Chief Justice of India (CJI), K.G. Balakrishnan.        
	But controversy has been swirling around Dinakarans possible promotion since members of the Tamil Nadu bar sent a representation to jurists like Fali S. Nariman and former law minister Shanti Bhushan against the judge, who is alleged to have amassed huge assets.        
	Nariman and Bhushan, members of the Committee for Judicial Accountability  the NGO involved in the campaign to bring the office of the Chief Justice of India under the purview of the right to information law  have already met Balakrishnan.        
	The CJI later summoned Dinakaran. More such meetings are in the offing.         
	Sources said some lawyers and jurists would call on Moily, maybe as early as tomorrow, to stop the elevation of Dinakaran, whose file is pending with the law ministry.        
	The other judges whose names have been cleared for promotion are chief justice of Madhya Pradesh High Court Ananga Kumar Patnaik, chief justice of Punjab and Haryana High Court Tirath Singh Thakur, chief justice of Calcutta High Court Surinder Singh Nijjar and chief justice of Gujarat High Court K.S. Radhakrishnan.        
	The names, once finalised by the apex court collegium, are sent to the law ministry for vetting by the Intelligence Bureau. From there, they are forwarded to the Prime Ministers Office and the President, who ultimately approves the names.         
	The government has the power to send the names back for reconsideration, but usually goes by the collegiums recommendation if the names are sent back a second time.        
	Bhushan said Dinakaran was a judge with no integrity. There are several allegations against him. He has acquired huge assets in Tamil Nadu (from where he comes from), the former law minister told The Telegraph.         
	Dinakaran has also released several hardcore criminals on bail within seconds, Bhushan added. His integrity is said to be shady by many members of the bar in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.        
	Bhushan said the law required the Chief Justice to also consult judges of the Supreme Court who had worked in the same court with the judge being considered for elevation to the apex court. That procedure seems to have been given the go-by in Dinakarans case, Bhushan said.         
	The Chief Justice, he said, has not consulted Justices Markandey Katju and Asok Kumar Ganguly who have worked in Tamil Nadu High Court and were aware of the reputation, conduct and behaviour of the judge concerned.

	 New Delhi: Sonia Gandhi can afford it but she will probably buy one for son Rahul  the young gun in the firing line of foes.          
	A scramble has begun to stock up on an exclusive brand of bullet-proof clothing made in Colombia after home minister P. Chidambaram warned 40 top politicians they could be targets of terror strikes on the campaign trail.          
	Miguel Caballeros Indian collection, Discreet Inners, has already sold 50 pieces of its light-weight clothing since being launched in March.          
	The prices could rival that of the biggest designer labels: Rs 30,000 to Rs 3 lakh, depending on the quality of the bullet-proof material.          
	Sources say most of the 40 politicians listed in the ministers threat advisory have placed orders and pressed for urgent deliveries.          
	We have bookings for 40-50 white kurta-pyjamas, vests and jackets. They are being rushed to meet the election deadline and will be delivered by Monday (April 6). Usually we have a four-week gap between booking and delivery, said Ashok Kumar, manager of Discreet Inners, which has brought the Caballero line to India.           
	The USP of the bullet-resistant kurta pyjamas, Nehru vests and jackets  the most popular items among Indian politicians  is that unlike the conventional protection gear, they dont make a person look bulky and overdressed.          
	The kurtas outer layer has linen, while the inner lining is made of silk. At 1.4 to 1.6kg, they arent heavy, and as easy to wear as buttoning up a simple cotton shirt. They cant be washed, only dry-cleaned.          
	Traditional bullet-proof suits with Kevlar synthetic fibres used as replacements for steel in tyres before being put in protective clothing can weigh up to 7kg.           
	The Caballero range has Two-A, Two, Three and Four levels. Two-A can repel a handguns bullets. Four can shield a person from the likes of AK-47.          
	Kumar said most of the orders were for Level Two protective wear, which would mean the leaders were safe from small weapons and carbines with 9mm bullets.          
	But despite its rising popularity, Caballero might disappoint power ladies like Sonia, her daughter Priyanka and the BJPs Sushma Swaraj: its current collection doesnt have saris.          
	To other politicians, the range could mean being in august company  Barack Obama and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez have sported Caballero labels.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Modi vs Cong in cricket poll
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Modi vs Cong in cricket poll
          RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR                                            
	Jaipur, Dec. 6: Tomorrows Rajasthan Cricket Association elections will be a straight fight between IPL commissioner Lalit Modi and Union minister C.P. Joshi with the third candidate withdrawing at the last moment today.        
	The pullout by Shiv Charan Mali, who is close to chief minister Ashok Gehlot, appeared to change the political equations dramatically.        
	Malis candidature was seen as a fallout of the rivalry between Gehlot and Union rural development minister Joshi, seen as close to Rahul Gandhi. There had been speculation earlier that Modi might not contest and, instead, support Joshi.        
	Now the fight has simplified into one between the Congress and Modi, a man the Gehlot government wants to cut to size because of his proximity to former BJP chief minister Vasundhara Raje.        
	Sources said Malis withdrawal appeared to have come under pressure from the Congresss higher echelons, although Mali denied this. The sources said the party was keen to prevent the Gehlot-Joshi rivalry from spilling out in the open, and realised that fielding a small-time Congress worker against a Union minister would not bode well for the party.        
	Mali, a district-level cricket official, has managed to extract the post of Rajasthan Sports Council chairman, equivalent to cabinet rank.        
	The twisted plot of fluctuating loyalties, however, continued with three Modi loyalists, who had switched sides and filed their nominations with Joshi two days ago, returning to the Modi camp.        
	B.L. Soni, Rajendra Singh Rathore and Subhash Joshi apparently changed their minds after finding that Sanjay Dixit, who had defeated Modi in the RCA presidents election last March, was with the Union minister.        
	Sources said that till 15 days ago, Joshi had not been keen to contest but Congress higher-ups had urged him on.        
	Losing two elections in a row could hurt Modis position in the BCCI. Joshi simply cannot afford to lose a minor election. Yet, with all the intricacies in mind, observers were not ruling out a possible deal being struck tonight.

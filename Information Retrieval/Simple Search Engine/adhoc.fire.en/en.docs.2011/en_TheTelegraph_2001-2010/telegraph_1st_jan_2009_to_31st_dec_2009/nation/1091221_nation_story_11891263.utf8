          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, Dec. 20: His police escorts thought L. Rajagopal would finish his chat with the media and get into their van, but the Vijayawada MP got into a waiting SUV and sped off, leaving the cops stunned.        
	The Andhra Pradesh police team was standing outside a Vijayawada hospital where the local Congress MP had been admitted last night after fasting for four days for the cause of samaikya (integrated) Andhra.        
	Today, on the fifth day of his fast, the police decided to shift Rajagopal to a hospital in Mangalagiri, 30km from Vijayawada, amid reports that his health had deteriorated.        
	Rajagopal, who was picked up yesterday on a court order, came out of the Vijayawada hospital in the evening.        
	Parked outside was his grey Tata Safari. There was a cluster of journalists, so Rajagopal told the policemen he would like to speak to them while they organised their transport to take him to Mangalagiri.        
	News bites done, Rajagopal walked to the grey car, got in and was off.         
	Vijayawada police have launched a hunt for the MP and have alerted their men on the Vijayawada-Visakhapatnam and the Vijayawada-Chennai highways.         
	Rajagopal, who resigned his Parliament seat to protest the Centres announcement to create Telangana, tried to take out a padayatra and start a hunger strike at Lal Bahadur Shastri stadium in Hyderabad. Both efforts were foiled by the police and he was sent to Vijayawada.         
	Today, he refused IV fluids, prompting the police to get the court order to break his fast.         
	In Hyderabad, all Congress legislators from the Andhra capital, barring one, stayed away from a party meeting on Telangana to emphasise that they wanted the IT city to be made a Union territory, not part of Telangana.        
	The meeting was called by the K. Rosaiah-led government that 15 Congress MLAs as well as MPs elected from the city were expected to attend.         
	The Hyderabad Congress legislators have voiced support for the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen who also want Hyderabad to be made a Union territory but including Muslim-dominated parts of Nalgonda, Medak and Ranga Reddy districts.        
	A Union minister from Andhra has said the Centre might make a satisfactory statement on Telangana tomorrow.        
	In Vijayawada city, where prohibitory orders have been in force for a week, film star Chiranjeevi took out a padayatra in support of samaikya Andhra today. Chiranjeevi, however, could not complete the march because of the prohibitory orders.         
	The Telangana Rashtra Samiti politburo, which met today, dropped its plan for a three-day bus yatra by chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao after advice from Delhi. Such a campaign may have further provoked the ongoing agitation in coastal Andhra and the Rayalaseema regions, said an analyst.

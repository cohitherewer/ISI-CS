The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | UPA red face over quota flip-flop
                                                                                                               UPA red face over quota flip-flop
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Ravi: Bill balm                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 20: The Prime Ministers Office may face embarrassing questions after a flurry of opposition to a bill it shepherded forced the government to backtrack and agree to drop sections of the proposed law.         
	The decision to continue job reservations at top academic institutions announced yesterday has cleared the way for an internal inquest into what many in the government believe was a near self goal minutes before full time.         
	Parliamentary affairs minister Vayalar Ravi yesterday assured Parliament that the SC/ST (Reservation in Posts and Services) Bill, 2008, would be altered after both UPA and Opposition MPs stalled proceedings.         
	The bill in its present form exempts 47 academic institutions  those recognised as institutions of national importance and the IIMs  from most job quotas for SC/STs. It was passed in the Rajya Sabha in December 2008.         
	The exemption will be completely deleted from the bill, Ravi said.        
	But top government representatives said that while Ravis clarification might help settle the governments position externally, several internal questions remained unanswered.         
	How did we arrive at this precipice without any warning? Trust me, had we fallen off, we would have been looking up at an elephant, a cabinet minister said.         
	The elephant was a reference to the election symbol of Mayavatis Bahujan Samaj Party, which has attacked the government for the proposed exemptions and which, many in the government believe, would have benefited politically from the bill.         
	But the anger in the ministers voice was not directed at the elephant.         
	Several top bureaucrats across ministries are questioning the manner in which the personnel and training department under the PMO rushed through the controversial bill with what they claim was inadequate consultation.         
	The UPA, over the past five years, has tried to build for itself the reputation of a friend of the SC/STs and the backward classes. Under this government, OBC quotas were introduced in higher education.         
	The controversial sections of the bill carried the possibility of eroding that image, so carefully cultivated.         
	In 2004, the UPA in its national common minimum programme had promised it would make SC/ST reservations a law  at present the quotas are implemented through executive orders.         
	A bill to make the quotas a law was introduced in Parliament in 2004 itself but was subsequently withdrawn. The 2004 bill did not exempt any institution from quotas.         
	As the Lok Sabha election approached, chemicals minister Ram Vilas Paswan mounted pressure on the coalition to engrave the quotas in law.         
	The 2008 bill was drafted by the personnel and training department under Prithviraj Chavan, minister of state at the PMO, but the controversial segments were not discussed with all ministries  as is the practice  before seeking cabinet approval.         
	Paswan and at least one other cabinet minister are learnt to have complained to senior Congress leader Pranab Mukherjee that they were unaware of the exemption clauses in the bill.

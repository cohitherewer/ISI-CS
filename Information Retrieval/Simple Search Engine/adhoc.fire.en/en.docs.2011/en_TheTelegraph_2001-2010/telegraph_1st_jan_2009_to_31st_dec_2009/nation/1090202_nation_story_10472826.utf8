The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Good news for one, not quite for other
                                                                                                               Good news for one, not quite for other
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Mukherjee, Narayanan: Contrasting voices                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 1: Indias official line on Pakistans response to its terror dossier has got obfuscated with foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee and national security adviser M.K. Narayanan speaking in contrasting tones.         
	Certainly they appear to be taking things seriously, Narayanan said in an interview to a television channel yesterday.         
	At least they are proceeding in a manner one would expect an investigating agency to proceed, asking questions and not accepting at face value everything that has been given, which is good news from our point of view, he added.         
	But Mukherjee and sources in the government have been saying that Pakistans response so far was totally unacceptable  quite in contrast to the good news that Narayanan has seen in the queries from Islamabad.         
	Government sources said there were contradictory responses from Islamabad and they wondered how serious Pakistan was with the probe based on the Indian dossier.         
	Mukherjee, who has maintained that Islamabads policy has been one of constant denial, said in Behrampore in Bengal today that Pakistan had not responded to the Indian dossier in any way. He did add that Delhi would be willing to share additional information that might be sought.         
	In an official statement yesterday, the foreign minister said Pakistan high commissioner Shahid Malik paid a courtesy call on home minister P. Chidambaram on January 29. He did not give details on the results of the investigation in Pakistan.         
	We have also seen media reports about certain statements by various Pakistani officials on their ongoing investigations, including a certain reported clarification by the Pakistani Prime Minister. I would like to underline that we have so far not received any official Pakistani response to the Indian dossier or official information on the outcome of their investigations. These are awaited.        
	Narayanan told the television channel: What I am aware of is that after the receipt of the dossier by Pakistan, the Pakistan government has reverted to us and asked a number of questions to which answers are being provided.... I presume they are yet to receive replies to the second set of queries they have made.         
	He added that as far as we are concerned, we believe Pakistan is making an attempt to arrive at the truth.         
	On Friday, Mukherjee had said: We have not received any information from Pakistani authorities through proper channel. Whatever we are hearing like you is through the media. This is not the way a government can respond. We expect them (Pakistan) to investigate and let us know the outcome of that investigation. Till now, we have not received any information from Pakistan.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Style amp; strong voices
                                                                                                               Style amp; strong voices
          SANJAY K. JHA                                        (From top) Azharuddin, Khursheed, Sushma, Tharoor                                 
	New Delhi, May 31: Mohammed Azharuddin will not have a bat to swish and Kabir Suman will perhaps resist temptation to break into Ultopalta proshno korona (dont ask rubbish questions).        
	Still, the new Lok Sabha, with its mix of young and veteran, brains and beauty, promises to be colourful  more, perhaps, than the previous one.        
	For one thing, the standard of the debate  and even the oratory  can be expected to rise.        
	The 14th Lok Sabha had suffered from a drought of good speakers on the Opposition benches who, after L.K. Advanis opening efforts, would come up with the dead-bat offerings of the Ananth Kumars, Shahnawaz Husseins and Kharabela Swains.        
	This time their line-up is stronger, thanks largely to signings from the Rajya Sabha. If Sushma Swaraj and Murli Manohar Joshi can bowl the political spin, Yashwant Singh and Jaswant Singh will not be afraid to hurl the economic and foreign-policy bouncers.        
	They will be pitted against a Treasury team that has added two of the finest speakers in the country, Salman Khursheed and Shashi Tharoor, to its impressive array of Manmohan Singh, Pranab Mukherjee, P. Chidambaram, Kapil Sibal and young guns like Jyotiraditya Scindia.        
	If things still get a bit long-winded sometimes, theres always hope that Shatrughan Sinha will fire a Khamosh!        
	He is unlikely to say it, though, if party colleague Varun Gandhi is tempted to overstep the line. Here one may start missing the stentorian no-balling by Somnath Chatterjee.        
	The headmaster may be gone but the government side has a college professor, Trinamuls Saugata Ray, to add substance and style to the discussions. Ears will prick up when Rahul Gandhis aide Meenakshi Natrajan speaks, too.        
	The House is sure to miss the jokes, songs and rhymes of the Republican Party of Indias Ramdas Athawale, but Independent Inder Singh Namdhari can try to make up the entertainment quotient with his theatrical skills.        
	And if veterans like Lalu Prasad and Raghuvansh Prasad Singh find themselves out of the government, they may just feel freer to dish out the humour.        
	The flow of soul will not lag the feast of reason: the Congress has popular religious guru Satpal Maharaj in its ranks, and the BJP the controversial anti-conversion protagonist, Dilip Singh Judeo.        
	The curiosity factor will focus on the grandsons and granddaughters.        
	Charan Singhs grandson Jayant Chaudhary has already attracted attention in western Uttar Pradesh for his brains; and Haryana veteran Bansi Lals stunning granddaughter Shruti Choudhary is bound to draw the cameras attention.        
	Jyoti Mirdha, doctor and granddaughter of Congress stalwart Nathuram Mirdha, is being billed a promising parliamentarian.         
	Eyes will also be on Mausam Noor, lawyer and niece of Ghani Khan Chowdhury, and Harsimrat Kaur, daughter-in-law of Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal.        
	A couple of son-rises too: Karnataka chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappas son K. Raghavendra Rao and H.D. Deve Gowdas son H.D. Kumaraswamy will make their Lok Sabha debut.        
	No sunset for the veterans, though. Former chief ministers Farooq Abdullah, Virbhadra Singh and Veerappa Moily will all adorn the treasury benches, trying to meet the firepower of the Oppositions Sharad Yadav.

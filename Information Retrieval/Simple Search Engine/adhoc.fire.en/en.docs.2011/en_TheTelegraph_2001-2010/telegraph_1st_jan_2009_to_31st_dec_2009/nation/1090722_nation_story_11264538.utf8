                                                                                                               House adjourned over quit issue
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           Raman Singh                                  
	Raipur, July 21: Opposition Congress members did not allow transaction of business in the Chhattisgarh Assembly for the second consecutive day today in protest against the Madanwada Maoist attacks that killed 36 policemen on July 12.         
	As the House assembled for the second day of the 10-day monsoon session, Congress members raised the issue again and stalled proceedings. The Opposition were adamant that chief minister Raman Singh should put in his papers.         
	The attack that killed superintendent of police V.K. Choubey took place because of the negligence of the government. Chief minister Raman Singh cannot escape from what is his responsibility, said the leader of Opposition, Ravindra Choubey.         
	Singh must resign immediately, he said, adding that the Congress would not allow the House to transact business till the chief minister quits. The Opposition has already refused any discussion on the issue in the House.         
	Due to the pandemonium, Speaker Dharamlal had to adjourn the proceedings twice for short periods to pacify the Congress members. When the members failed to give up their agitation, he adjourned the House for the day. The house will now meet on July 23.         
	Chhattisgarh minister for parliamentary minister Brijmohan Agrawal said that the Opposition did not have any issue to grill the government and hence they were disrupting the House proceedings. He called the incident and the actions of the Opposition unfortunate.

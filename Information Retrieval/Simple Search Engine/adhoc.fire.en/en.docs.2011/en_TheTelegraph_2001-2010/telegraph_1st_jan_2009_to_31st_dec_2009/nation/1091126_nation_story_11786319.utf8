          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Police officers and CRPF personnel at a Naxalite-hit village                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 25: Four revolutionary parties and mass organisations today demanded withdrawal of paramilitary and police forces from Narayanpatna, where two activists of the Maoist-backed Chasi Mulia Adivasi Sangh were killed in police firing recently while allegedly trying to loot arms from the police station.        
	The deaths of K. Singana, a top-ranking leader of the Chasi Mulia Adivasi Sangh, and Andrew Nachika were a well-planned murders executed by the police with the help of CRPF and India Reserve Battalion. It was not an act of self-defence as made out by the men in khaki, a fact-finding team comprising leaders of the CPI-ML (Liberation), CPI-ML, Lok Sahakti Abhiyan and Lok Sangram Manch told reporters here today.        
	The killing was preceded by a series of door-to-door raids in Koraputs Narayanpatna villages in which men had been tortured and women humiliated and sexually abused, alleged Prafulla Samantara (Lok Shakti Abhiyan), Radhakant Sethi (CPI-ML Liberation), Budha Gamanga (Lok Sangram Manch) and Sivaram (CPI-ML).        
	On November 20, leaders of the organisation had gone to the police station to protest atrocities in the name of combing operations and the firing started when K. Singana was inside the police station and talking to the inspector.         
	As soon as he came out, he was targeted and killed, the fact-finding team members further charged.        
	Describing the killing as a planned murder, they demanded a judicial probe by a sitting high court judge into the incident as well as land-grabbing issue, registration of murder cases against the police and all other culprits besides a compensation of Rs 10 lakh each to the bereaved families.                                
	Alleging that a Salwa Judum type of operation is being carried out in Narayanpatna in the name of peace committees, they sought immediate dismantling of such groups.        
	Their other major demands included immediate withdrawal of all armed paramilitary and police forces, withdrawal of all cases registered against innocent peasants and members of the organisation and state protection to tribals, who had occupied their land grabbed by landlords.

          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, Nov. 28: Maoists killed a deputy forest ranger after abducting him last night from Deobhog in Raipur district.        
	According to police sources, the victim had been identified as Gokul Tandi, who was posted in Indagaon forest range of Deobhog development block, about 180km from here.         
	Around 11.30pm last night, he received a phone call that a group was illegally cutting trees in the forests. Tandi, along with four forest guards, started for the spot. As they entered the forests, about 12-15 armed Maoists intercepted them and took them into custody, Deobhog police officer T.R. Nagwanshi said. They released the guards after threatening not to inform the police and took the official into dense forest.        
	Local villagers, Nagwanshi said, this morning discovered the body in the forest and informed the police. Since the police feared ambush, a team of forest employees and villagers were sent to the spot to bring the body.        
	Sources said the body was brought to Indagaon this afternoon. The body bore severe assault mark, as the rebels brutally bashed the forest official with guns and lathis till he succumbed to his injuries. No bullet mark was found, he added.        
	Chief minister Raman Singh has condemned the incident and said the brutal killing of an innocent forest official signified an act of cowardice and frustration of Maoists.

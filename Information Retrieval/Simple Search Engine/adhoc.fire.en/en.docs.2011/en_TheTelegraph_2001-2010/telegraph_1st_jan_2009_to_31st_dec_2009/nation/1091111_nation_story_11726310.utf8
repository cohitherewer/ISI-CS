          RASHEED KIDWAI                          Shivraj Singh Chauhan                                  
	Nov. 10: A plane carrying Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan and governor Rameshwar Thakur almost collided with two vehicles while landing, the close shave coming minutes before the Presidents arrival.        
	Chief secretary Rakesh Sahni said the two vehicles, reportedly belonging to the air force, entered the Gwalior runway as the plane was touching down this morning. But Indian Air Force chief Air Chief Marshal P.V. Naik claimed the vehicles were trying to shoo away a dog.         
	The air traffic controller (ATC) was in the know of things, the air chief said, adding the VIP plane was asked to circle in the air for a while.        
	The air force has an airbase adjacent to the airport, called Vijayaraje Scindia Air Terminal. Chauhan and Thakur were flying in to receive President Pratibha Patil ahead of an air force programme at the airbase.        
	Sahni said the aircraft flew over the vehicles and stayed in the air for eight to ten minutes before landing.         
	Official sources in the Madhya Pradesh government said in Bhopal that the state plane was landing only after getting the ATCs clearance and added that it was asked to abort the process when it was less than 100 feet from the ground. Senior bureaucrats claimed the incident resulted from a lack of co-ordination between the air force and the ATC.        
	Sahni said he had written to the Union civil aviation and defence secretaries about the incident.         
	Chauhan was apparently calm after the near-miss but is said to have expressed displeasure to his officials.        
	Patil landed at the base a few minutes later. Although her arrival was smooth, the incident just before her touch-down revived memories of the close shave in Mumbai in February this year.         
	A Delhi-bound Indian Airlines flight with 150 passengers had to abort take-off after spotting an army helicopter, one of three in the Presidents convoy, land in front of it.        
	Patil later presided over the air force programme, attended by Chauhan and Thakur. She conferred the Presidential Standards on two premier combat units of the Indian Air Force  No. 47 Squadron and Tactics and Air Combat Development Establishment (TACDE)  in the presence of IAF chief Naik.         
	Later, Naik said the Presidents planned flight in a Sukhoi would take place from the Pune base on November 25.

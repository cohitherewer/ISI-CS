The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bihar gets New Year full of promises
                                                                                                               Bihar gets New Year full of promises
  - 2009 to be Politically correct?          NALIN VERMA                          Will the New Year be his?                                        
	Patna, Dec. 31: The year 2009 brings with it a promise of developments in all spheres  political, social, educational and infrastructure  at Bihar.         
	The state suffered the biggest natural catastrophe with the Kosi changing its course in the wake of a breach in its embankment in Kusaha (Nepal), marooning millions and obliterating thousands of homes, livestock and crops in five districts on the Indo-Nepalese border. However, the Kosi Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Committee, put in place by the government, has started to re-build the flood-ravaged homes, roads, schools and community centres, with the support of industrial houses and national and international NGOs.         
	Experts engaged in the exercise promise an engineering marvel to replace the old embankment on the river emanating from Nepal. These exercises obviously promise to end the ferocity with which Kosi had struck in 2008.         
	Politically, 2009  billed to be the election year  is slated to be exciting for both the ruling NDA, led by Nitish Kumar, and Opposition UPA, led by Lalu Prasad.         
	The chief minister who has been cementing his foothold in the Bihar politics, received a shot in his arm by inducting former chief minister and socialist veteran Ramsunder Das in his fold at the fag end of the year. What is now sure is that Nitish Kumar-led NDA has a formidable candidate to take on Ram Vilas Paswan on the prestigious Hajipur seat  so far a pocket borough of Paswan in the north of the Ganga.         
	But then, the UPA has not weakened either. At the end of 2008, the maverick railway minister and Union chemical and fertiliser minister Ram Vilas Paswan worked out a truce in Bihar. The two stalwarts, it is now clear, will stay united to fight the 2009 Lok Sabha polls. The Lalu-Paswan combination had virtually routed the NDA from Bihar in 2004 polls by winning more than 30 out of the states 40 seats and effectively denying A.B. Vajpayee dispensation to retain the power in Delhi.         
	Congress, too, is not as enervated in Bihar as it was before. Nehru-Gandhi scion Rahul Gandhi visiting the flood ravaged Bihar and meeting the marooned people has generated excitement particularly in the young generation of electorate.         
	The New Year also promises better policing  a problem area in Bihar. The government has embarked on exercises to open a Bihar police academy at Rajgir for which it has already acquired 133.28 acres. It would also set up a Bihar Military Police Battalion at Balmikinagar on the Indo-Nepal border and has decided to set up a special force to police the tourist spots such as Bodh Gaya, Rajgir and Sonepur fair.         
	The New Year also promises dividends to check brain drain as an Indian Institute of Technology, a Chanakya Law School University and Chandragupta Institute of Management  on a par with IIM, Ahmedabad.                           
	Besides, a panel, led by Nobel laureate Amartya Sena, is in the process of setting up an international university at Nalanda. Former President A.P.J. Abul Kalam has already consented to head it.         
	Competing with each other Nitish Kumar, Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan have either led foundation stones or inaugurated many ambitious schemes that should see the light of the day in New Year.        
	Nitish Kumar government has been working hard to improve the road, power, school and health sectors. Lalu Prasad has inaugurated more than 20 railway projects in November-December alone, including a wagon factory in Chapra and Digha-Pahleja rail bridge that promises to bridge the gap between north and south Bihar.        
	Paswan has inaugurated the revival of the moribund Baruani Fertilizer factory in north Bihars Begsarai district.

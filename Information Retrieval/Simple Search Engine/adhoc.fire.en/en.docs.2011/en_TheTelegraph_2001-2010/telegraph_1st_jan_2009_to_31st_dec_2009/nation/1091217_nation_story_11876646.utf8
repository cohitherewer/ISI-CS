	AYATOLLAH tag        
	Serious differences have emerged between India and Australia over the direction of talks at the climate summit, with environment minister Jairam Ramesh dubbing Canberra an Ayatollah for its one-track approach.        
	Australia is sort of the Ayatollah of the single track, Ramesh was quoted as saying by The Sydney Morning Herald. Developing countries say Australia and its        allies are trying to push the  outcome of the talks away from the Kyoto Protocol and Ramesh called it a recipe for disaster.   
	Ramesh, who cancelled a meeting yesterday with Australias climate change minister Penny Wong, said he hadnt pulled out and was unfortunately too busy to hold the meeting aimed at breaking the deadlock.        
	Penny Wong remains a good friend, a very valued colleague, Ramesh said. But Wong, asked why the meeting was cancelled, said: You will have to ask him        
	CALL TO Bangla        
	Barack Obama dialled Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Ethiopian Premier Meles Zenawi to seek their support in combating climate change, marking a rare occasion when a US President made personal calls to leaders of third-world countries to discuss issues of global importance. President Obama encouraged Prime Minister Hasina to help reach a robust agreement at the summit, the White House said in a statement        
	OVER TO Mexico  
	Former US Vice-President and environment activist Al Gore urged world leaders to meet in Mexico City in July to complete the treaty under negotiation in Copenhagen.        
	Gore said a summit in Mexico City, previously scheduled at the end of next year, was too late. I do not believe that we can wait until next November or next December, said Gore, a Nobel Peace Prize winner for his work on raising awareness about climate change                  Activists stage a protest at the Bella Centre in Copenhagen on Wednesday.

	BEYOND Kyoto        
	The European Union has said it prefers a single agreement that goes beyond Kyoto following protests by ministers of BASIC countries (Brazil, South Africa, China and India) and Africa that the Kyoto Protocol was being ignored.        
	We prefer a single agreement. We support the architecture of Kyoto... we want to use all the good things of it but its not enough. Were more ambitious than Kyoto, Stavros Dimas, the European Union commissioner for environment, said        
	ANIMAL voices        
	A theatre group devised a novel way to urge people to take a closer look at climate change  it staged a play in Delhi recently where artistes took on the roles of endangered species like the blue whale, female turtle and Chinese Panda and held mock debates on global warming.         
	Unheard Voices, the 25-minute play by Pukar, urges mankind to act now or never to combat climate change We have tried to deal with a serious business in a casual way, aiming to make the common man aware of the impact, director Aditya Uppal said

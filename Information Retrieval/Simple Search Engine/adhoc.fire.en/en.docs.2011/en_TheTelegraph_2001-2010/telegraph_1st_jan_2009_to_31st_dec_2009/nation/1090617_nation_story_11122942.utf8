The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rajnath breaks routine news, creates buzz
                                                                                                               Rajnath breaks routine news, creates buzz
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Jaitley: Playing by the book?                                  
	New Delhi, June 16: Four days before the BJP national executive meets for the first time after the Lok Sabha debacle, Rajnath Singh drew attention to his party for the wrong reason  Arun Jaitleys resignation.        
	Jaitley put in his papers as general secretary on June 6, soon after he was appointed leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha. The resignation was in line with the norm of one person, one post that is generally followed but not enforced in the BJP. Jaitley left for a holiday in Britain soon after.         
	Party president Rajnath, in his wisdom, kept the resignation under wraps, sources said. But this morning when a TV reporter asked him if Jaitley would keep both posts, Rajnath revealed that he had already quit as general secretary.         
	The sudden revelation fuelled speculation whether the resignation was prompted by veiled criticism within the party of Jaitleys handling of the election campaign.         
	It was not a resignation in protest. It was a procedural formality, spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudy later clarified.         
	Asked why Rajnath had made it public today and not earlier, Rudy said: Theres no need to publicise such routine affairs.        
	In 2005, when the RSS forced L.K. Advani to resign as the BJP president after the controversy over his praise of Jinnah, one reason cited was that he could hold the posts of party chief and leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha simultaneously. Advanis backers had refused to see merit in the convention but eventually he had to quit.         
	Sources said punctilious Jaitley had played by the book to stave off the charge that he was hankering after office. Party veterans Jaswant Singh and Yashwant Sinha have suggested that Jaitley was rewarded with the Opposition leaders post in spite of leading the BJP to defeat as principal strategist and campaign manager because he is an Advani loyalist.        
	However, a more objective view is that Jaitleys appointment  as well as that of Sushma Swaraj as the deputy leader in the Lok Sabha  was cleared by the RSS. Under its new chief, Mohan Bhagwat, the RSS has regained the veto it nearly lost under his predecessor K.S. Sudarshan whose ideas on the economy and gender often embarrassed the BJP when it was in power.        
	With the Congress evolving a new phalanx of leadership under Rahul Gandhi, the RSS was convinced that a generational change was overdue in the BJP and that Advani would have to make way for Jaitley and Sushma, who are in their fifties, sources said. The passing of the baton would mean that Sinha and Jaswant, who are 72 and 71 respectively, would also have to step aside with Advani.        
	Sources close to Jaitley said he was unlikely to attend the office-bearers meeting on June 19 and the ensuing national executive. The courts are shut (he is a lawyer) for summer. He has decided to take a break with his family. Thats all, they said.        
	Unlike the BJP, the Congress appears to have decided not to make a virtue of the one-person, one post principle. At least five of its office-bearers, including four general secretaries and one national secretary, have become ministers.        
	It was expected that in an impending shuffle, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Mukul Wasnik, Prithviraj Chavan, V. Narayanaswamy and Jairam Ramesh, would demit their organisational posts. But a top functionary said: There is no hard and fast rule that they will have to.        
	Azad, the health minister, is learnt to have conveyed to the leaders that he would like to stay on as general secretary and look after the states he was assigned. As his ministry grappled with measures to tackle swine flu, Azad took time off to go to Orissa, of which he is in charge, and analyse the reasons for the Congresss defeat with state leaders.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Modi tirade against Centre
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Modi tirade against Centre
                            
	Katihar, Nov. 20 (PTI): Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi today accused the Centre of adopting a step-motherly attitude towards the state and depriving it of special packages required to tackle flood and drought.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh made an aerial survey of the devastation caused by Kosi river last year and declared it as a national calamity, but he maintained silence over the states demand for a special package after giving Rs 1,000 crore against the demand of Rs 14,800 crore, Modi told reporters.        
	This year, the state government submitted a memorandum to the Centre seeking a package of Rs 23,000 crore to tackle the drought problems, but the Centre has failed to allocate a single penny, he said at an official function here.        
	Alleging that the Congress-led UPA government was discriminating against the state, Modi said its decision not to help the state in its critical hour reflected malafide intentions.        
	Bihar was not against the Rs 7,266-crore central package for Bundelkhand, he said, adding: But it is highly unjust and condemnable if the Centre is overlooking Bihars genuine call for assistance.        
	Chief minister Nitish Kumar, Modi and other leaders in Bihar have been complaining against the Centres attitude for the past couple of years.

                                                                                                               Food delay holds up Rajdhani
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, June 13: Passengers of a Howrah-New Delhi Rajdhani Express, angered by a delay in evening snacks, staged an agitation at Dhanbad station, forcing the train to remain stranded for an hour this evening.        
	Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation officials said there was a delay of two-and-a-half hours in serving the snacks in two AC three-tier compartments.         
	The food is normally served around 5pm, just after the trains departure.        
	A shortage of pantry car staff caused the delay, officials said.        
	When the train stopped at Dhanbad, the passengers of the two compartments lodged a complaint with the divisional commercial manager.         
	The official accompanied the complainants to the train to investigate the matter, delaying the departure by almost an hour.         
	The Rajdhani, which stops for five minutes at the Dhanbad station, was held up from 7.42pm to 8.33pm.        
	However, the snacks were served around 7:30pm in these compartments, a railway official said.         
	Senior officials of East Central Railway and the Rajdhani Express pacified the passengers and apologised for the delay, railway sources said.

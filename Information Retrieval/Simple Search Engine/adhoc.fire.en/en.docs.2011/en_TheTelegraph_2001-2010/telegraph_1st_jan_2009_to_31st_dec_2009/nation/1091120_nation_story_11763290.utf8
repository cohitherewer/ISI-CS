	New Delhi, Nov. 19: The Congress tried to salvage the sugarcane situation to some extent by revealing that Rahul Gandhi had extracted a promise from the Prime Minister that farmers interests would be protected under any circumstances.        
	The sugarcane protest today mainly involved farmers from Uttar Pradesh, a state that tops Rahuls political agenda. The protest overshadowed a special package of Rs 7,266 crore cleared by the Union cabinet for the integrated development of Bundelkhand, a proposal being pushed by Rahul for some time.        
	The Congress was at pains to prevent the special occasion from being hijacked by the sugarcane protesters who attracted widespread media coverage throughout the day.        
	Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh issued a statement late in the evening that Rahul had called on Manmohan Singh during the day and entreated him to ensure that sugarcane farmers did not have to suffer because of mill owners.        
	The statement said: Rahul Gandhi has met the Prime Minister to convey the sentiments of the sugarcane growers in Uttar Pradesh. The Prime Minister has assured him that the government would look into the matter again and assured (him) that the ordinance will be suitably amended if it is in the interest of farmers.        
	The party leadership has already drafted Pranab Mukherjee to resolve the crisis as the Prime Minister, who held an emergency meeting to discuss the issue in the afternoon, is leaving for the US the day after tomorrow. Mukherjee has called an all-party meeting on Monday.        
	Government sources said some parties had misled the farmers, and the Opposition would see reason if the ordinance was placed before them in the right perspective. Even then, they say, if some constructive suggestions are made, the changes will be incorporated to protect farmers interests.        
	The Congress tried its best to confront the Opposition charge that a black law was being brought to stifle the farmers. Digvijay said: The party appeals to all sugarcane growers of Uttar Pradesh to have faith in pro-farmer policies of the UPA government and assures them that it will ensure highest possible sugarcane price in the present context.         
	The Congress has always been sensitive to the issues of farmers and it was at the initiative of Rahul that the sugarcane arrears were paid to the farmers, he added.        
	The statement issued by the party recalled that a delegation of farmers led by Digvijay and UPCC president Rita Bahuguna Joshi met agriculture minister Sharad Pawar after the new ordinance was issued.        
	They requested Pawar to reconsider the ordinance but he explained the reasons behind the ordinance and assured them that this would not affect the price to be paid to the farmers by sugar mills.         
	He said each sugar mill would have to negotiate an optimum price with farmers in view of the prevailing high prices of sugar in the open market and assured us that the farmers would not get anything below Rs 180 per quintal in Uttar Pradesh, Digvijay said.        
	Congress sources said the government was reviewing the subject after this delegations request but some parties tried to hijack the agenda by creating misgivings in the minds of the farmers.        
	The party feels that the battle is more for the political space in the largest state than to promote the interests of the farmers and hence played what it thinks is its best card: Rahul.

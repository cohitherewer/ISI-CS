                                                                                                               Fatuha fortifies JD-U grip on Bihar
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Patna, June 1: Continuing its winning spree in Bihar, JD(U) today retained Fatuha, defeating nearest rivals LJP and RJD.        
	The seat had fallen vacant following the death of JD(U) MLA Suryug Paswan and had gone to bypoll on May 27. Paswans wife Damyanti Devi also entered the fray as an BSP nominee after being denied a JD(U) ticket.         
	JD(U)s Arun Majhi today got 36,916 votes against the 25,036 in favour of his nearest LJP rival Punit Rai, who trailed second. The CPI(ML) nominee, Vidyanand Ram Vikal, recorded 9,477 votes coming third, while Congresss Dwarik Paswan was relegated to a poor fourth with 5,063 votes. However, the win should prove sweeter to the LJP and RJD as the Congress had ruined the fate of RJD-LJP nominees in 12 of the states 40 Lok Sabha constituencies.        
	The JD(U) had the backing of ally BJP, while RJD had supported LJP nominee. Both Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan had campaigned for Rai on this seat reserved for a Scheduled Caste candidate.         
	The Fatuha result indicates that Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar is still charming voters, while RJD-LJP combination continues to be the main Opposition in Bihar. The Congress still has a long ground to cover to occupy a political space here.         
	JD(U)-BJP had swept the Lok Sabha polls, winning 32 of its 40 seats. The RJD and Congress had won four and two each with LJP drawing a blank. Rais defeat will be felt heavily by the LJP as the politician is a relative of LJP boss Ram Vilas Paswan and both Paswan and Lalu Prasad had intensely campaigned to drum up support for him. The two had their hopes pinned on Fatuha as BJPs Shatrughan Sinha had trailed from this Assembly contituency during the LoK Sabha polls. Fatuha is a part of the Patna Saheb parliamentary constituency.        
	With Rais victory, JD(U)s tally in the Assembly rises to 81 followed by BJP (52), RJD (51), LJP (09), INC (08), CPI-ML (05), BSP (04), CPI-M and NCP (one each), besides Independents (11). Altogether 17 of the 243 Assembly seats in Bihar are vacant at present.

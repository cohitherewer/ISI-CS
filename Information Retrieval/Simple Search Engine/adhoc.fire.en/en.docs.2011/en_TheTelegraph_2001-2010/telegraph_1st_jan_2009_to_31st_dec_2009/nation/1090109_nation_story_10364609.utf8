The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lalu roots for Koda
                                                                                                               Lalu roots for Koda
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, Jan. 8: Shibu Sorens defeat has once again brought Madhu Koda into reckoning for the Jharkhand chief ministers post, at least political reverberations here prove so.        
	The RJD and Congress would go all out to see Koda stage a comeback as the chief minister, if sources close to the powerful UPA player and railway minister, Lalu Prasad, are to be believed.        
	Gurujis defeat is unfortunate. But the UPA is as strong in Jharkhand as ever. There is no question of power going to the communal BJP or imposition of Presidents rule. The UPA will get a chief minister to carry on with the secular government in Jharkhand, Lalu Prasad said.        
	Against the popular perception that Gurujis defeat has dealt a body blow to the UPA in Jharkhand, the RJD and Congress are not too worried at Sorens debacle. In fact, Lalu Prasad never wanted Guruji to replace his Man Friday, Koda, as Jharkhand chief minister.        
	The reasons: Lalu Prasad had played pivotal role installing Koda-led UPA rule by showing Arjun Munda-led BJP government the door. The RJD chief, whose party has eight MLAs in the Jharkhand Assembly, was said to have been ruling the state by proxy with obedient Koda in the saddle. Lalu Prasad demonstrated his love for Koda by referring him frequently as Jharkhand ka ghoda (horse).        
	And the Congress  heavily dependent on Lalu Prasads strength and political acumen in the region  too was more comfortable with Koda at the helm, as he was always ready to surrender to the UPA rather than powerful Soren.        
	Sources close to Lalu Prasad revealed that the UPA strategists  who have summoned both Koda and Soren to Delhi  would go all out to convince the fallen Dishum Guru to vacate the seat for proven Koda and accept respectable accommodation in the UPA fold. But Lalu Prasad and other UPA strategists are believed to be still afraid of the move of Soren who would like to have his own person as chief minister rather than the one pliable more to the wishes of Lalu Prasad and Congress.

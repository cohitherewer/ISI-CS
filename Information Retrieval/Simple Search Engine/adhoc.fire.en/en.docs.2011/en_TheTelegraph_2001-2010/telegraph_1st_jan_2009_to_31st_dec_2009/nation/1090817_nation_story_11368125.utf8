                                              Victoria      
	London, Aug. 16 (PTI): Queen Victoria had instructed the wife of Maharaja Ranjit Singhs grandson not to have children, in an attempt to maintain the hold of the British Raj over the Sikh kingdom in Punjab, a new book has claimed.         
	The British queen had instructed Lady Anne Alice Blanche, the English wife of Duleep Singhs eldest son Prince Victor Albert Jay, not to have children, Peter Bance, a British author, has said in his book Sovereign, Squire amp; Rebel.         
	The book  a biography of Duleep Singh, the son of Maharaja Ranjit Singh  claimed that Victoria had given the instruction 12 years after the British army stopped a disgruntled and rebellious Duleep Singh from returning to India from England, where he had been taken as a 12-year-old boy-king.         
	Like his father, Victor had also made a futile attempt to visit India in 1898.         
	Victor, who had wanted to honeymoon with Anne in India, was stopped by the British in Colombo.         
	On their return, they attended a ball thrown by Victoria at Buckingham Palace on July 8, 1898. Victors sister Princess Sophia, younger brother Prince Frederick and several other royals from India were present at the ball.        
	It was after the ball that Victoria instructed Anne not to have an offspring, Bance has claimed in his book.        
	The book also refers to an alleged British plot to stem the royal Sikh bloodline.         
	According to the book, Princess Bamba, Duleep Singhs youngest daughter from his first marriage, had told members of the Fakir family, who were former ministers in her fathers court, that when they were children their English cooks would put certain substances into their food so as to make them infertile.         
	None of Duleep Singhs children had any offspring.

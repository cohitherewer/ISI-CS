	Cuttack, Dec. 25: A Mongolian ship that sank near Paradip in September and sparked fears of an oil spill that could threaten Olive Ridley turtles was a rogue vessel with fake papers, a preliminary probe said.        
	MV Black Rose had entered the Paradip port without valid documents to carry illegally extracted iron ore, sources in Orissa polices crime branch, which took up the case on Wednesday, said.        
	The ship was 32 years old and evidently not seaworthy. It had gained access to the Paradip harbour on September 4 despite having no valid documents. Even the insurance papers submitted were found to be fake, a source said.        
	The ship left the port on September 9, five days after its arrival, and sunk hours later. Reports of the oil spill had triggered environmental concerns as the site where it went down is close to Gahirmatha marine sanctuary, one of the few remaining nesting sites in the world for the endangered Olive Ridley turtles.         
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik had ordered the pollution control board to probe the spill.        
	The ship had left the harbour without filing proper documents and taking customs clearance for the cargo (iron ore), the source said.        
	Nearly 23,843 tonnes of ore was loaded in addition to 971 tonnes of inflammable furnace oil and substantial quantities of lubricant oil, the probe has revealed.        
	Suspicion about the vessel, registered in Mongolias Ulan Bator but owned by Singapore-based Black Rose Maritime Ltd, deepened as no one had come forward to make any claims after it capsized.

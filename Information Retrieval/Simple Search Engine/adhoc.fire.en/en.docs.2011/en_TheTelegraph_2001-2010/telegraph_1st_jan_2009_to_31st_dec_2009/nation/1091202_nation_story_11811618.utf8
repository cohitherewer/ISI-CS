                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Most devastated dinner couple break silence 
                            
	Washington, Dec. 1 (AP): The couple that got into the White House state dinner for the visiting Indian Prime Minister without showing invitations have denied that they were gatecrashers.        
	Appearing on a morning television show with his wife, Tareq Salahi said the furore surrounding him and his wife Michaele over their attendance at the dinner a week ago had been a most devastating experience.        
	Salahi told NBCs Today show there was more to their side of the story  an explanation that would exonerate them from allegations of misconduct in the breach of White House security.        
	White House spokesperson Robert Gibbs, appearing on the same programme, stood by the administrations position that the Salahis had not been invited.         
	This wasnt a misunderstanding, Gibbs said. You dont show up at the White House as a misunderstanding.        
	For his part, Salahi said he and his wife Michaele were co-operating with the Secret Service in its investigation of the incident.        
	He said they both had great respect for President Barack Obama. Were greatly saddened by all the circumstances... portraying my wife and I as party crashers. I can tell you we did not party-crash the White House, Salahi said.        
	Earlier, Gibbs said that Obama and his wife, Michelle, were both upset by the incursion. Interviewed on news channel MSNBC, Gibbs said: Its safe to say he (Obama) was angry. Michelle was angry.        
	Gibbs noted that the Secret Service was investigating what went wrong and said the White House was also re-examining its procedures.        
	Michaele Salahi described the couple as shocked and devastated when they saw accounts of the incident the following morning.        
	Asked if they had been mischaracterised through the media and other paparazzi forums, Tareq said: No question... Its been devastating whats happened to Michaele and I.... Our lives have really been destroyed.        
	Everything weve worked for, Michaele Salahi told NBC. We were invited, not crashers, and there isnt anyone who would have the audacity or the poor behaviour to do that, she said. No one would do that, and certainly not us.        
	It was also revealed that the couple communicated with a senior Pentagon official about going to the event, but the official denied that she helped the couple get in.        
	Michele Jones, a special assistant to defence secretary Robert Gates, said in a written statement she never said or implied she would get the Salahis into the event.        
	I specifically stated that they did not have tickets and, in fact, that I did not have the authority to authorise attendance, Jones said. Even though I informed them of this, they still decided to come.

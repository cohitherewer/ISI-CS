The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | SP sets price: sack Maya
                                                                                                               SP sets price: sack Maya
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, May 7: Mulayam Singh Yadav today set the price for his support to a government at the Centre: sack the Mayavati regime.        
	We will support whoever dismisses the Mayavati government. The youth, farmers and traders are all disheartened with the Uttar Pradesh government, Mulayam said after voting in Mainpuri, the Lok Sabha seat from where he is contesting.        
	The Samajwadi Party chief, who predicted that no government at the Centre would be formed without his partys support, made it clear that he would throw his lot behind any political combination that promised to send the BSP regime packing.        
	This is an unconstitutional government. It is not being run properly. It should be sacked, he said.        
	BSP leader S.P. Maurya said Mulayams comments betrayed his desperation. The BSP government hasnt come to power because of the mercy of any Samajwadi leader. Mulayams demand for dismissal shows his desperation.        
	CPM stand        
	The CPM today criticised the Congress for making alliance overtures while defending the nuclear deal that the Left was opposed to.        
	The Congresss overtures to the Left come while it simultaneously justifies the India-US nuclear deal as being in supreme national interest, says the forthcoming issue of CPM mouthpiece Peoples Democracy. The editorial iterates the Left position that the effort is to form a non-Congress secular government, saying such a dispensation is needed to pursue an independent foreign policy.

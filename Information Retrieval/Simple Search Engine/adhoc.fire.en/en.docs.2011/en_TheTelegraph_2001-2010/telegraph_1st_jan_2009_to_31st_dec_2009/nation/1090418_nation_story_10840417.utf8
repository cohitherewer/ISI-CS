The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | The BJP FACE THAT WORRIES ALLY NITISH
                                                                                                               The BJP FACE THAT WORRIES ALLY NITISH
          'Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar spoke to Nishit   Dholabhai of The Telegraph on his alliance with   the BJP, the possibility of one with the Left and his   comparison with Narendra Modi.   Taking stock in the evening after the first phase of polling, Nitish said he knew many voters did not want L.K. Advani as Prime Minister. Nitish counted it his achievement that he had been able to earn the trust of the minorities despite the alliance with the BJP.   He had gone to the BJP only after approaching the Left first, Nitish said. Stressing that there would be no compromise on secularism, the Janata Dal (U) leader left open the option of going with the communists in future.                                                                        Nitish Kumar and L.K. Advani campaign together in Buxar on April 10. (PTI)      
	Are your development initiatives going down well with the electorate?        
	Development and peace is on the agenda and our focus is solely on these two issues. That people should rise above caste and vote for development and, of course, peace. You can see girls moving around on bicycles. Women are coming out in the thousands. When did women come out in like this in Bihar?        
	Why dont you insist on 33 per cent reservation for women in Parliament?        
	Let the big parties decide. The BJP and Congress always have issues with each other.        
	The question asked again and again is why did you, a socialist, ally with the BJP?  
	We had approached the communists first in the 1990s, before we allied with BJP to avoid a split.  
	So if the communists offer a hand of friendship, will you shake it?  
	 That we will see later. Why should I destabilise the state? Only when we face a problem can it be thought of. Earning the trust of the minorities along with the BJP, is it an ordinary achievement? Yeh alag baat hai ki Advaniji ka chehra dekh ke vote dene mein hichkichahat hai (It is another matter that there is a reluctance to vote (for us) after seeing Advanijis face). We have earned the minorities trust and goodwill in Bihar taking the BJP with us. Why do you always want to see it in the perspective of votes, there is also trust and goodwill. We have empowered the Mahadalits or EBCs not because they can be counted as votes; that they will vote is a different matter. No one is talking against the government after 40 months, and there are 14 more months to go.  
	But talking of state politics and national interest is not completely the same. See, this is an experiment (going with the BJP) and it is not complete yet. There are two more years to go.                  
	Your focus on development seems to have prompted a comparison with Narendra Modi?   
	 There is no comparison between Bihar and Gujarat. We are land-locked while Gujarat has a coastal area, with good land for agriculture and promotion of industry. Come with me to the Ganga, it has dried up after (the construction of) the Farakka barrage. Moreover, Gujarat never had an absence of governance; it always had a work culture. As for Bihar, even the British left it alone and concentrated on Bengal, which had the advantage of a coast. Therefore, it is not correct: Bihar is a unique case.  
	What is your stand on the nuclear deal and terrorism?  
	 The nuclear deal is being sold as a great thing but we are not impressed. We think that security has been compromised. The US was not able to save itself from the financial meltdown. They want to impose their technology on others and dump their junk in other countries. The way terrorism is being tackled is for everyone to see. Terrorism cannot be finished with dadagiri. Can you finish terrorism by bombing Afghanistan? We can face terrorism only through understanding  understanding between different communities. We are agrarian people and feel welfare can be done by bringing up the rural communities and the downtrodden. What is all this? Tete paon pasariye, jete lambi khat (Live within your means).  
	Your reasons for opposing the nuclear deal appear different from the BJPs   
	 You are coming back to the same question. JP (Jayaprakash Narayan), (Ram Manohar) Lohia and Karpoori Thakur all took support. One thing is clear, there is no compromise on the secular ideology. They (BJP) are partners.  
	Do you mean development discourse is overtaking politics of ideology?  
	 I believe in Gandhijis principle that development should reach the last man. With all the ideology, look what is happening in the SEZs. What a mess it has been with Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan, and though Manmohan Singh is a good and efficient man, his government was ineffective.

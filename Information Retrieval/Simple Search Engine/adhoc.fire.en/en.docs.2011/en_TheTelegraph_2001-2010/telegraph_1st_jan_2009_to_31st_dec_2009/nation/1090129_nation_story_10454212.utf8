          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Srinagar, Jan. 28: Security forces shot dead the top Lashkar-e-Toiba commander for north Kashmir this morning after a nightlong gun battle but said the slain Abu Hamza was not the Pakistan-based mastermind who guided the Mumbai attackers.        
	A soldier also died in the shootout in Baramulla district on a bruising day that saw four more casualties, including a jawan, in separate encounters elsewhere in the Valley.        
	Police said Hamza was killed in Azamgarh, Sopore, some 55km from Srinagar, in a joint operation with 52 Rashtriya Riffles and 179 and 177 battalions of the CRPF after a tip-off that he was hiding in the house of Akbar Lone, a villager.        
	Hamza was responsible for co-ordination between different outfits operating in the area, a police officer said.        
	Some officers at first thought this was the same Abu Hamza, believed to have been the handler of Ajmal Kasab, the lone terrorist taken alive during the Mumbai attacks. But Kashmir police denied that the slain militant had any link with the November strike.        
	He had nothing to do with the terror strikes, Kashmir inspector-general of police B. Srinivas said.        
	Police sources said there was nothing to prove the slain Hamzas links with Mumbai or Kasab. There are many Hamzas in the Lashkar set-up. But the commander killed today had no connection with Kasab. If he indeed had, the police would have highlighted it as it would have been a big victory for them, said a source.        
	Baramulla police chief Anand Jain said the encounter lasted so long because the plan was to minimise collateral damage. We launched the offensive today morning and eliminated him (Hamza).        
	The sources said the militant gave a tough time to the forces and kept on shifting from one house to another in the congested village before being cornered in a shed.        
	An AK-47 rifle and four magazines were seized from the site of the encounter that also left three constables injured.        
	Two militants and an army jawan were killed in an encounter in Ayatmullah in Bandipora district.

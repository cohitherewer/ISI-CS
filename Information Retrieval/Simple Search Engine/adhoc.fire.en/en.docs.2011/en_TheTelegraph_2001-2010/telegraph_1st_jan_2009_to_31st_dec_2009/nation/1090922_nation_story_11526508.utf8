  - Debate over Pokhran nuclear tests descends into slanging match         G.S. MUDUR                                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 21: The debate over Indias hydrogen bomb capability, rekindled by a former defence research official, has degenerated into a murky slanging match loaded with claims and allegations, but bereft of hard scientific evidence.         
	K. Santhanam, who was involved in the nuclear weapons tests in Pokhran on May 11 and May 13, 1998, has said the thermonuclear device  a hydrogen bomb  tested on May 11 had failed to deliver its intended yield of 45 kilotons.        
	Within weeks after the tests, a team of US researchers had expressed their doubts about the yield. But Indian nuclear scientists had argued in a research paper in a peer-reviewed journal that the tests had been successful and India did not have to conduct any more nuclear weapons tests. This had prompted the government to announce a unilateral moratorium on testing.        
	But Santhanam, who had once worked in the atomic energy establishment, has amplified concerns  first expressed by him at a meeting of strategic experts four weeks ago  listing specific observations from the site to back his claims.        
	An intact test shaft after the explosion, the absence of a crater, and instrument readings, he said, suggest that the main hydrogen bomb failed to ignite at least anything like fully and even let alone explode with its designed power.        
	Santhanam, who had once stood alongside top atomic energy and defence research officials to declare the May 1998 tests a success, said he wasnt a Rip Van Winkle who had woken up after 11 years.        
	He has accused the nuclear establishment and the government of ignoring a 50-page document the Defence Research Development Organisation (DRDO) had submitted at the end of 1998 outlining its concerns about the hydrogen bomb test.        
	The attitude is  my mind is made up, dont confuse me with facts, Santhanam said. This is like religious dogma. Science doesnt progress through such a process.        
	Santhanam and other strategic experts have said India should resume tests of thermonuclear weapons to perfect the technology of hydrogen bombs and resist pressures to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).         
	Amid the debate, some analysts are speculating whether Santhanam might only be articulating the views of sections of the government and perhaps even the nuclear weapons establishment who do not want India to accept the CTBT.        
	But a former head of the nuclear weapons programme at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (Barc) said instrument readings, radioactivity levels and other evidence from the site clearly demonstrate the success of the tests.        
	There was damage to the shaft, Satinder Sikka, the scientist said. Researchers in Trombay have simulated the explosions and reproduced the exact surface features that were observed, Sikka told The Telegraph.        
	But Santhanam has alleged that Barc has selectively used data to declare the thermonuclear weapon test a success. The trouble lies in what data was included in the Barc analysis and what was not, Santhanam said.        
	He claimed that Sikka himself accepted the failure to his former bosses and to himself (Santhanam) as well in detailed bilateral scientific discussions, but the former chief of the atomic energy commission, R. Chidambaram, had muzzled him.        
	Sikka has denied this. This is an utter lie, Sikka said. I didnt know he (Santhanam) would stoop to such depths.        
	Sikka said Santhanam was not in any way involved in the physics or the instrumentation associated with the Pokhran tests.        
	Santhanam has also challenged assertions made by the national security adviser, M.K. Narayanan, to a television channel. Narayanan had said that Santhanam has absolutely no idea what he is talking about.        
	Indeed I do. The boot is on the other foot, Santhanam retorted today. He also said Narayanans assertion that India has thermonuclear capability should be taken with a kiloton of salt.        
	Sikka said Barc had produced a 100-page rebuttal to the document from the DRDO. Both documents were discussed at a special meeting called by the national security establishment in 1998-99.        
	Santhanam has suggested that all the data from the tests should be made available to an independent panel of scientists  including retired former nuclear scientists who would be familiar with the science of weapons  for scrutiny and recommendations.         
	The government could decide the course of action, Santhanam said. Such a report could well be labelled a classified document, he said, with selected portions released for the public.

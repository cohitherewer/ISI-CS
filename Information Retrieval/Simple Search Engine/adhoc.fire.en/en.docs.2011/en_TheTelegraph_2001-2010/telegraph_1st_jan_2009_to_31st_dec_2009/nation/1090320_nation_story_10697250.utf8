The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nutter Indian head of Notts
                                                                                                               Nutter Indian head of Notts
          AMIT ROY                          Nat Puri: Dream fulfilled                                  
	London, March 19: The Nottingham County Cricket Club has honoured a senior Indian businessman, Nat Puri, by appointing him its president for a two-year term of office, it was confirmed today.        
	He will attend policy meetings and be involved in the direction of the club, a spokesperson for the club said.         
	Popularly known as Notts, the club has been a venue for Test and county matches since 1838, making it the third oldest cricket ground in the world. Its current players include the Indian-origin Samit Patel who has been told to lose weight by the England selectors.        
	Patel may have partaken too liberally of the kebabs and other Indian snacks Puri shares generously with friends whenever he is at a cricket ground. His friends say: Nats a cricket nutter who fits in his business in the lunch and tea intervals.         
	One of the first things I did when I arrived in Nottingham was to become a member of the club, Puri said, explaining that his appointment as president of Notts was the fulfilment of a lifelong ambition.         
	I have enjoyed visiting the ground ever since and have supported the club in many ways. I am a lifelong cricket supporter and with this appointment, I now have the perfect excuse to spend more time at Trent Bridge.         
	He told The Telegraph today: My job is to promote Notts and be a good host.         
	A passionate supporter of the Indian cricket team, he gifted 50,000 to Virender Sehwag in March 2004 for scoring more than 300 runs in a Test innings. When The Telegraph joked that at the rate Sehwag was going, he would make Puri a poor man, the tycoon laughed and made a new promise: I will double the money if he goes past 400. I will be more than happy to pay the money. I love watching Indian cricket.         
	The clubs chairman, Peter Wright, said: Nat has been a long-standing supporter of Nottinghamshire cricket and he has strong links within the game, both in UK and India. We are delighted that he has agreed to be appointed president of our club.         
	Wright went on: I believe he is the first Indian president, (this) is by no means a small achievement, considering the game originated in England in the 16th Century.         
	Puri, who heads the Puri industrial group of companies (previously called Melton Medes), has often invited guests at the box he has retained at the ground and also put 60,000 into the press box which was named after him.         
	Notts said in a statement that Puri had been a Notts member since emigrating from India in 1966 and was confirmed as the successor to Bill Russell at the clubs annual general meeting last week.         
	Having worked in business locally and internationally for many years, Nat brings a wealth of experience to the role. He is still the controlling shareholder in the Purico group of companies.         
	Puri, who was born in Punjab in 1939, came to Britain in 1966 with 450 to study for a Diploma in Air Conditioning amp; Refrigeration Engineering at National College, London, now part of London South Bank University. From 1967 to 1975 he worked with FG Skerritt Ltd, a Nottingham-based company.         
	He left to start a consultancy business.         
	He went back to acquire Skerritts in 1983 through a new company called Melton Medes Limited.         
	Married with one son, his interests are now controlled by the Purico group of companies and associates, which have revenues of 425 million per annum and specialise in manufacturing.        
	His businesses employ over 2,500 people in the UK, Mexico, Germany, China, India, Poland and Hungary.        
	But since 2000, he has been devoting more time to his charitable activities  and to watching India.

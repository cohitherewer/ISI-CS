          RASHEED KIDWAI                           Manmohan Singh with Pranab Mukherjee in Delhi. File picture                                  
	Jan. 23: Pranab Mukherjee, the perpetual Number Two in successive Congress regimes since the Indira Gandhi era, has once again been assigned a task he learnt to perform for short spells under Indira.        
	Today, when Mukherjee called on Sonia Gandhi, he was asked to look after the responsibility of running the government without a formal designation. The veteran leader took it in his stride as he has done before.        
	In 1978, when the Congress had split and Indira faced a mass exodus, Mukherjee was on her side as AICC treasurer. The subsequent return of Indira as Prime Minister saw him handling industry and commerce and then finance.        
	Mukherjees trust quotient with Indira was so high that on a few occasions, she used to let him handle key assignments that involved the task of prevailing upon three senior ministers  R. Venkataraman, P.V. Narasimha Rao and N.D. Tiwari. Mukherjees former cabinet colleagues recall the ease with which he used to bring about consensus in the cabinet, making the task of the Prime Minister a lot easier.        
	At the political level, too, Indira had used Mukherjee to secure the resignation of a reluctant A.R. Antulay in 1982 in the wake of an adverse court ruling. The era saw Mukherjee often acting as Indiras enforcer in Andhra and other states where chief ministers were replaced successively.        
	When Rao became Prime Minister, Mukherjee continued to call him PV in private but in cabinet and other formal meetings, he always addressed him as Mr Prime Minister Sir.        
	Although unsubstantiated  and inevitable in a coalition  whispers surface once in a while, Mukherjees relations with Manmohan Singh and Sonia remain cordial and that of mutual respect.        
	Singh became Reserve Bank of India governor when Mukherjee held the finance portfolio. But when the economist became Prime Minister in May 2004, he found in Mukherjee a reliable colleague who excelled in multi-tasking. Mukherjees efficiency came in the way in June 2007 when both Singh and Sonia appeared reluctant to spare him for the post of President of the country.        
	Mukherjees cabinet colleagues say his grasp of issues and clarity of thought easily earns him respect from all, including Sharad Pawar who had served as chief minister of Maharashtra and knows a few things about administrative acumen.        
	But Mukherjees ties with Rajiv Gandhi hit the nadir when Mukherjee was expelled from the Congress in 1984. Sources close to Mukherjee insist it was a case of misunderstanding that was cleared when Rajiv brought him back into the Congress.        
	Mukherjee was with Rajiv in Bengal when news of the attack on Indira reached them. The duo returned in the same aircraft.        
	One version is that overwhelmed by grief, Mukherjee went to the aircrafts toilet and wept. He then chose to sit at the back of the aircraft because his eyes were red. But his opponents within the Congress accused him of plotting and scheming against Rajiv.        
	Another version has it that when Rajiv had posed a theoretical question about the caretaker Prime Minister, Mukherjee had stressed on seniority, which was later construed as his desire to occupy the Prime Ministers chair.        
	The Mukherjee of 2009 is a lot more seasoned. Sources close to him insist the additional responsibilities assigned to him on the 112th birth anniversary of Subhas Chandra Bose have not changed anything and the minister is anxiously looking forward to wish Singh a speedy recovery and greet him quickly with a Mr Prime Minister Sir.

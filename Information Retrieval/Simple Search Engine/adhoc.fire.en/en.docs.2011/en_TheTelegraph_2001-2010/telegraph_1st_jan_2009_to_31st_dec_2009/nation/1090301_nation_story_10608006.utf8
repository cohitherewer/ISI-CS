                                                                                                               Navy for sea security
                            
	Kochi, Feb. 28 (PTI): A.K. Antony today handed the responsibility for the countrys maritime security to the navy, three months after 10 terrorists took the sea route to enter and attack Mumbai.        
	Against the backdrop of multiple agencies involved in coastal security and the resultant problems of co-ordination, the government has decided to designate the navy as the authority responsible for overall maritime security, which includes coastal security and offshore security, the defence minister said.         
	The navy, he added, would be assisted by the coast guard, state marine police and other central and state agencies.        
	The coast guard, marine police, the BSFs marine wing and customs officials are all in charge of coastal security now. There is also talk of bringing in the CISF to guard the countrys 12 major ports. Each agency has its brief and co-ordination among them is lax  a flaw that showed after the 26/11 attacks when questions arose on intelligence sharing.         
	Antony said: The coast guard is additionally designated the authority responsible for coastal security in territorial waters, including areas to be patrolled by the coastal police. The coast guard director-general will be designated as the commander of coastal command. The director-general will be responsible for overall co-ordination between central and state agencies in all matters on coastal security.        
	Four joint-operations centres will be set up for smooth functioning of the new plan. The centres will be in Mumbai, Visakhapatnam, Kochi and Port Blair, under the navy commanders-in-chief, who will be designated commanders-in-chief of coastal defence.         
	Antony also announced the formation of a 1,000-strong Sagar Prahari Bal to protect naval assets and bases.         
	Pak navy plays safe        
	Pakistan navy chief Noman Bashir, who had said he had no evidence to show Ajmal Kasab had taken the sea route to India, today played safe. We have not been directly involved in the investigation, which is under the domain of the interior ministry. They have better knowledge and information, Bashir said.

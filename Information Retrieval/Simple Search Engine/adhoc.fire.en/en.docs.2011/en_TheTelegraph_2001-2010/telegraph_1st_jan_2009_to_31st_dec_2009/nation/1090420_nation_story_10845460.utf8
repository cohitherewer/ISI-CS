The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Paswan struggles on home turf
                                                                                                               Paswan struggles on home turf
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Hajipur (Bihar), April 19: A right turn from the 5.575km Mahatma Gandhi setu on the Ganga reveals a highway dotted with mango, guava and litchi orchards.        
	The gardens on both sides of the 35km Hajipur-Dharampur-Mahnar-Dhamdaha road however lack flowers  diminishing hopes for a good yield of mangoes this summer.        
	Like the trees, the voters, too, may not hold out hope for Ram Vilas Paswan, a veteran from this seat.         
	The Dalit leader is hopeful of creating a history of sorts from this north Bihar seat, as he has won Hajipur seven times before in his political career. He entered the Guinness Book of World Records by winning this seat in 1977 with a record margin. He bettered his own record in 1989 and since then he has been winning everytime.        
	Probably, for the first time in 40 years, Paswan, a Mayavati substitute in this belt, finds himself in rough waters, battling hard to come out unscathed from a triangular trap woven by JD(U) and Congress.        
	What makes this trap intricate even more potent for him is the image of a betrayer that the voters have tagged him with. Why did he (Paswan) oppose the formation of the Rabri Devi government in February 2005 and caused another election within nine months in November 2005 bringing in the Nitish Kumar government, asks, Nagdeo Rai, a Yadav, at Dharampur, angrily.        
	Rai argues: If he opposed Lalu-Rabri regime to the extent of ushering in a fall of the 15-year regime, why has he now joined Lalu Prasad.        
	Voters engaged in animated discussion at Dharampur also recall how the LJP boss, contesting the polls in alliance with the RJD, had quit the A.B. Vajpayee government and voted against it leading to its fall in 1999 and thus causing another poll within a year of 1998.        
	What adds up to his trouble, is Muslim voters growing fascination with the Congress offering a so-called secular alternative against the LJP-RJD combination to the largest minority community this time along.         
	Congress has fielded Dasai Choudhary whom Muslim voters are considering a worthy substitute to the RJD-LJP leaders in their battle against a communal BJP.        
	And the JD(U) riding on the vikas ka hawa, fanned by the Nitish Kumar government, has fielded a man of clean image and former Bihar chief minister Ram Sunder Das  a suave and soft spoken socialist veteran  who appears to have more friends than enemies among the electorate.        
	Voters have taken notice of the smoother roads that have replaced the dilapidated ones that were the hallmark of the Lalu-Rabri regime, the new schools and the panchayat bhavans, giving a hope to Das to hit the Lok Sabha portals in the twilight of his political career.         
	Paswan battling to regain his seat has persuaded his friend-turned-foe-turned-friend Lalu Prasad to carry out a road show on the Yadav dominated Raghopur, Mahnar and Dhamdaha areas to douse the anger of the Yadavs against him and turn them in RJD-LJPs favour. Only an upset can save Paswans fate from this seat, said Rajnarayan Singh at Mahnar leaving The Telegraph contemplating if Paswan will end up on the wrong side of history this time.

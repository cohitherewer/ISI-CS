          RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR                              
	Jaipur, Aug. 11: Farmers in Rajasthan are refusing to part with their land the government wants to acquire for the expansion of a thermal power plant in Baran district.        
	Farmers of 11 villages in the district, about 300km from Jaipur, have been agitating for the past three days, saying they would not give up their land at any cost for the two upcoming units of 660MW each of the Chhabra Thermal Power Plant.         
	The farmers, who grow coriander, wheat and opium, say the government can acquire the wasteland lying around instead of insisting on their fields. At least 2,000 farmers sat on a dharna today and submitted their demands to the collector.        
	Nobody wants to give up their farmland, Brij Bhushan Sharma, a farmer and advocate who is leading the agitation, said.         
	At least 5,000 farmers of 10-11 villages are involved. We dont want to take money as it is a perishable commodity.        
	The government wants to acquire 2,366 bighas from the farmers. It is willing to pay Rs 2 lakh per bigha for irrigable land and Rs 1.5 lakh per bigha for non-irrigable land.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong in ticket tight spot
                                                                                                               Cong in ticket tight spot
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, March 29: The state Congress faced a revolt-like situation in its ranks today after tickets for Lok Sabha and Assembly polls were distributed.         
	Senior leader and former deputy Speaker Bibhuti Bhusan Singh Mardaraj resigned from the Congress after being denied a party ticket. Mardaraj earlier had represented Khandapara constituency in Nayagarh. He was denied a ticket, while former MP Soumya Ranjan Patnaik was nominated as a candidate from Khandapara.         
	Protests were witnessed at Jeypore in Koraput after sitting MLA and president of district unit Tara Prasad Bahinipati was denied a ticket from Jeypore, as his Koraput constituency was reserved for Scheduled Caste candidates. A lesser-known K. Nagaraj Dora, the personal assistant of Giridhar Gamang while he was the chief minister in 1999, was chosen.         
	Infuriated, Bahinipatis supporters burnt an effigy of Gamang, as they blamed the former CM and a local MP, for pressurising the party and nominating Dora.         
	As many as 14 block presidents resigned in protest, while workers locked the Congress office at Jeypore.        
	Irate workers also vented their ire against the candidature of Srikant Jena and Ranjib Biswal from Balasore and Kendrapara, consecutively. Workers at Balasore hung a garland of shoes on Jenas effigy and put up a hoarding protesting the nomination of an outsider. Jena, who earlier was elected from Cuttack and Kendrapara Lok Sabha seats, does not belong to Balasore. Former Speaker Sarat Kar, former Union minister K.C. Lenka, former minister Kishor Patel and former PCC president Kamala Das and PCC general secretary Sibananda Ray were also denied tickets.         
	BJP delay        
	The BJP, that had promptly released its first list of poll candidates last week, is still lagging behind other parties when it comes to its second list. Sources said the delay was caused by Orissa president Suresh Pujari  who remained undecided over which seat to contest for a long time.         
	Pujari, a resident of Sambalpur, was keen to contest from the western Orissa town, represented by former minister Jaynarayan Mishra in the dissolved Assembly.         
	Mishra had filed his papers from the seat. Finally, Pujari settled for Brajarajnagar constituency, from where he had contested 2000 and 2004 polls.

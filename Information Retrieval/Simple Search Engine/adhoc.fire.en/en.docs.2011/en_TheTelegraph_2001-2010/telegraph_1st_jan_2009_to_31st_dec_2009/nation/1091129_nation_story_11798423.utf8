The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | US denies India access to Headley 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      US denies India access to Headley 
                            
	Washington, Nov. 28 (PTI): The US has said it is ready to share details of the Headley case but cited legal hurdles to allowing Indian investigators to quiz the two alleged Lashkar operatives.        
	US national security adviser James Jones said President Barack Obama had shown personal interest in the David Coleman Headley-Tahawwur Rana case and the matter was discussed during his meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh earlier this week.        
	It is something that the President and the Prime Minister discussed and both of them were satisfied with the outcome, Jones said.         
	There are certain aspects of our legal system that protect the right of the accused, Jones said.        
	A team of Indian investigators was recently in the US to question the two accused. However, they were denied access to either of the arrested.         
	The US investigators are understood to have shared details of the interrogation. Indian officers have unearthed a number of links like the number of times Headley and Rana visited India, the places they visited and the persons they came in contact with.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | India keeps wary eye on Bangla army
                                                                                                               India keeps wary eye on Bangla army
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 26: The Bangladesh Army and the Rapid Action Battalion are said to have caught 16 BDR personnel who were allegedly trying to flee to India.        
	For India, a temporary and fragile truce that is being enforced by rolling tanks on the streets of Dhaka and the show of firepower is fraught with apprehensions over how long the army will be willing to sit back and digest the bloodletting of its officer cadre.        
	Reports reaching here have indicated that dozens of fleeing mutineers had been pursued and taken into custody.        
	However, without the co-operation of the BDR soldiery, army officers will also find it demeaning to perform the menial tasks that they normally assigned to the sepoys.        
	The Indian and Bangladeshi armies are engaged in a joint training exercise for the first time in Jalpaiguri currently.         
	The Bangladesh Army has not fought a conventional war as a regularly organised military since 1971. As such, its regimen and culture is something that it will have to imbibe by itself, unlike India or Pakistan that rode their colonial legacies.        
	In either case, mutiny is seen as a gross and intolerable offence meriting the harshest of punishments.

                                                                                                               Brand BJD behind sweep
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, May 17: In a verdict that proved all pre-poll projections wrong, BJD overcame its break-up with the BJP and made a clean sweep in the 26 seats in undivided Cuttack including present Cuttack, Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapada and Jajpur.        
	With BJD candidates riding the crest of a pro-Naveen wave, both Congress and BJP could not bag a single seat, in tandem with their poor performance in the rest of the state.         
	The BJD won all 24 seats it contested, an improvement from its 17 seats (in alliance with BJP) in 2004. The remaining two seats went to the NCP and an Independent backed by the BJD.         
	States voters ensured the defeat of political heavyweights such as Samir Dey (BJP), Bijay Mohapatra (BJP), Umesh Chandra Swain (Congress), Sitakanta Mohapatra (Congress), Nalinikanta Mohanty (Congress) and Sarat Rout (Congress). It seemed that the strategy-based attack on ruling BJD government, both by the Congress and the BJP, failed.         
	While BJP lost all its three seats, including partys bastion in Cuttack (city), all six sitting Congress MLAs were defeated. Voters apparently approved BJDs welfare schemes such as the much flaunted rice for Rs 2 and pension scheme for BPL people and discarded anti-BJD slurs.         
	It was the leadership of Naveen Patnaik that made all the difference. His image gave BJD candidates an edge over rivals, said Debashis Samantaray, who emerged as the giant killer by winning the Cuttack (Barabati) seat pushing former minister Samir Dey (BJP) to a poor third.         
	The BJP had fancied that the BJD had lost half of its electoral prospects after the break in alliance.         
	The Congress, on the other hand, had hoped to win in triangular contests from the division in non-Congress votes. But that didnt work.        
	With BJD support former minister Amar Satpathy won Barchana on an NCP ticket defeating sitting Congress MLA Sitakanta Mohapatra.

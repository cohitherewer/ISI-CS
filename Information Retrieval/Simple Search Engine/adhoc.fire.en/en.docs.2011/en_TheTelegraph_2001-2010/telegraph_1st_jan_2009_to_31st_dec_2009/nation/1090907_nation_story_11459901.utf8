The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Driving licence rap 
                                                                                                               Driving licence rap 
                            
	New Delhi, Sept. 6 (PTI): Delhi High Court has sought an explanation from the Centre for barring a resident from applying for a driving licence on the ground that he had not provided proof of citizenship.        
	It is a strange case. Even foreigners, who have a driving licence of their country, are issued a licence, Justice Sanjeev Khanna said.        
	The court has asked the ministry of shipping, road transport and highways to explain under which law it refused to issue the licence.        
	The order came on a petition filed by high court advocate Ajit Kumar, who was barred from appearing for a written examination for a driving licence on the ground that he failed to prove his citizenship.        
	Ajit said though he submitted the documents, including his school-leaving certificate and advocate registration number, he was denied a licence.        
	The court directed the government to file its response by October 21, explaining under what provision of law citizenship was mandatory for issuing a driving licence.         
	Telecom breather        
	The Supreme Court has held that consumer courts cannot hear disputes related to telecom services under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.        
	The judgment comes as a relief to telecom operators that were being dragged to consumer courts for deficiency in service.        
	The provisions of the Indian Telegraph Act, which is a special law, would prevail over a general law like the Consumer Protection Act, a bench headed by Justice Markandey Katju said.

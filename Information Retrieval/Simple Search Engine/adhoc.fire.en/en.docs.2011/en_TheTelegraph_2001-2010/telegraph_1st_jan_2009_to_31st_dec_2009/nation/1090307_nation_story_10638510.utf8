	 Lucknow: A party floated by former IITians and other professionals will field candidates from 40 seats across the country in the coming Lok Sabha elections.          
	Bharat Punarnirman Dal will contest from at least 20 seats in Uttar Pradesh and 40 seats across the country on the issue of good governance, restoration of ethics in politics and opposition to caste-based reservation, party president Ajit Ashwalayan Shukla said.          
	Shukla, who has an MTech degree from IIT Bombay, said Ravishanker Bharat, a chartered accountant, will contest from Lucknow.           
	The party has also finalised candidates for Kanpur, Ghaziabad, Varanasi, East Delhi, South Delhi, Hyderabad and Bhubaneswar, he added.          
	The so called secular parties are unable to provide solutions to problems like terrorism. People are looking for a change, Shukla said.           
	The party made its election debut with the Uttar Pradesh Assembly polls in 2007.           
	 New Delhi: Sanjay Dutts petition in the Supreme Court, seeking a stay on his conviction in the Bombay blasts case to allow him to contest the Lok Sabha elections, will be heard on March 30. A bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan has issued notice to the CBI and sought its reply on the plea. Dutt is the Samajwadi Party candidate from Lucknow.          
	 New Delhi: V.P. Singhs son Ajay Pratap has joined Ram Vilas Paswans Lok Janshakti Party. He will contest the election from the Fatehpur Lok Sabha seat in Uttar Pradesh, Paswan announced, adding he would request UPA allies not to field a candidate against Ajay Pratap.           
	 Patna: The Election Commission is turning to star power to get people out to vote. You will see stars shining in the electoral battlefield this time, chief election commissioner N. Gopalaswami promised. He wasnt talking about the stars parties would field to campaign or contest, but about those the poll panel would ask to educate voters why they must exercise their right. So, who will it be, Amitabh Bachchan or Shah Rukh Khan? Gopalaswami wasnt telling. I will not name any star.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | UGC stumbles on teacher selection 
                                                                                                               UGC stumbles on teacher selection 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 28: The UGC has allowed individual universities to evaluate on their own the quality of PhDs of aspiring teachers, accepting its inability to ensure entry standards for faculty a month after notifying minimum standards.         
	Universities can by themselves decide whether PhDs held by aspirants to teaching posts meet required standards, without validation from the UGC under a new order issued by the commission, The Telegraph has learnt.         
	The order includes a specific admission from the UGC that it is at present unable to identify candidates of various institutions who have been awarded PhD degrees in compliance with the newly set standards.         
	In order to teach in universities in India, a candidate must either hold a PhD degree or clear the national eligibility test (NET) or equivalent examinations held by states.         
	Last month, the UGC for the first time notified minimum qualifications for the grant of a PhD degree in Indian higher educational institutions, in a bid to tackle growing complaints against substandard doctoral degrees and research.         
	Several institutions were allegedly running PhD programmes through distance education, allowing students to pick their research guides.         
	The commission said it would evaluate the quality of doctoral programmes at various universities and prepare a list of institutions offering PhDs that meet the new standards.         
	But in an order now sent to vice-chancellors, the UGC has asked universities to appoint teachers based on their own assessment of the degrees, without waiting for the commissions recommendations.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Debesh advises caution on IT park burial
                                                                                                               Debesh advises caution on IT park burial
          BISWAJIT ROY                          Debesh Das                                  
	Calcutta, Sept. 6: The CPM may want the Rajarhat IT township project scrapped but is in a dilemma after IT minister Debesh Das warned this would kill the plans to make room for investors like Infosys before the 2011 polls.        
	The CPM has asked the government to cancel its joint venture for the township with the Vedic promoters, accused of land-grabbing for the project, after examining the legal constraints.        
	Officially, Das, who has handed a report to the party, declined to speak on the matter today except to reaffirm that the government cannot be involved in any illegal activities.        
	Party insiders, however, said Das, who is not in the partys top hierarchy, had indicated a desire to step down since his efforts to host Infosys and Wipro in the proposed township were now likely to be aborted. The project would have generated 2.25lakh jobs, Das has told the CPM.        
	Das, party sources said, is sceptical of the moves by industries minister Nirupam Sen and housing minister Gautam Deb to try and find land for Infosys and Wipro elsewhere.        
	We have missed the last bus. Acquisition or purchase of alternative land would take another year and a half. By that time, the term of this government would be over, a party leader quoted Das as saying.        
	The minister is apparently unhappy that unlike land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah and Deb, the party hasnt allowed him to explain his role in the Vedic controversy. Dass department had entered into an agreement under which the government would get 600 acres free in the IT project in exchange for developing infrastructure for the entire 1,200-acre township.        
	He (Das) is an academic and wants to be seen as above board. He also wanted the party to make a statement on the township project. But we are yet to take the final decision since we too want Infosys to be here, a state secretariat member said.        
	Das, in his report, has owned responsibility for his departments deal with the promoters, which was approved by the full cabinet. But he has denied knowledge of any forcible land purchase by the private partners, saying the agreement didnt provide for government supervision of their land purchase.        
	Although the CPM leadership is trying to distance itself from Vedic promoters Raj Modi and Amarnath Shroff, also partners in the township project, Das apparently had a few words of praise for them. The government had failed to bring Infosys. It was Modi who convinced Infosys to set up shop in the township, a leader quoted Das as saying.

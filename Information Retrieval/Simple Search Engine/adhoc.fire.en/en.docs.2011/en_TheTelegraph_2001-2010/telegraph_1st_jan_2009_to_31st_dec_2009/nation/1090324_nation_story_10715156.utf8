          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Patna, March 23: Voters willing, the wife of a convicted Rashtriya Janata Dal MP will take over from her husband in his stronghold that has a large number of Muslims.        
	Mohammad Shahabuddins wife Heena Sahab figures on the list of candidates that RJD boss Lalu Prasad announced here today.         
	She is the nominee from Siwan, a seat that her don-turned-MP husband has been winning since 1996.        
	Shahabuddin, whose appeal for suspension of his conviction is still pending, had requested Lalu Prasad to contest the seat himself. But the RJD boss appears to have decided that Heena will be a better choice.        
	Lalu Prasad will himself contest from Saran and Pataliputra. He had won Saran and Madhepura in 2004 but kept the former.        
	This time, he has preferred Pataliputra, a new Yadav-dominated constituency carved out as a result of delimitation. Saran (old Chapra) has been his stronghold.        
	Abdul Bari Sidiqui, Shakeel Ahmad Khan and Lallan Paswan will be the RJD nominees from Madhubani, Aurangabad and Sasaram. These had been left to the Congress last week and were won by the party in 2004.         
	The announcement could further rankle the Congress, which has decided not to name nominees against Lalu Prasad in his two seats and Ram Vilas Paswan in Hajipur.        
	The RJD, which listed 25 candidates today, has not taken a decision on Maharajganj, Patna Saheb and Madhepura, from where Janata Dal (United) chief Sharad Yadav will be in the fray.

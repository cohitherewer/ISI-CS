The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sangh chief faces BJP challenges
                                                                                                               Sangh chief faces BJP challenges
          SANJAY K. JHA                           Sudarshan (left) with Bhagwat in Nagpur on Saturday                                  
	New Delhi, March 21: The elevation of Mohan Bhagwat to the post of RSS chief is being seen with enormous curiosity in BJP circles even as few people expect any dramatic change in the internal dynamics of the larger Sangh parivar.         
	But the dominant view is that Bhagwat faces a daunting task primarily because the post-poll scenario might throw up big challenges before the BJP.         
	The first change that Bhagwats leadership will bring in the RSS-BJP relationship is a climate of mutual trust. The outgoing RSS chief, K. Sudarshan, had developed a strong antipathy towards Atal Bihari Vajpayee who paid little heed to the Sanghs wishes during his tenure as Prime Minister. His relations with L.K. Advani also got badly strained after the Jinnah controversy.         
	Although Advanis removal as BJP president in the wake of the Jinnah row was a collective decision of the RSS, Sudarshans personal equation with him got ruined after that.         
	Bhagwat has an excellent working relation with top BJP leaders who appreciate his understanding of contemporary politics and his pragmatism. But at the same time, sources say Bhagwat strongly feels about ideological corruption in the BJP and would like a crackdown on deviant elements.         
	Although not much change will be manifested till the general election, the RSS will have to play a vital role in stabilising the internal dynamics of the BJP if it fails to return to power.         
	A senior leader said: Despite Advanis presence, we are witness to unseemly squabbles among senior leaders; the recent Rajnath-Jaitley spat is a case in point. You can imagine what will happen once Advani is out of the scene.         
	There is no defined chain of command among the second-rung leaders like Rajnath Singh, Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley, M. Venkaiah Naidu, Murli Manohar Joshi and Jaswant Singh. Apart from fierce competition, these leaders do not have the mutual understanding that Vajpayee and Advani had. Then there are powerful chief ministers like Narendra Modi and B.S. Yeddyurappa who love to take their own decisions.         
	In fact, the RSS had serious problems with Modi and Vasundhara Rajes style of functioning and both the chief ministers developed an antagonistic relationship with the Sangh parivar outfits. Sources say Bhagwat will not allow things to drift and the issues of ego clash and ideological deviation will be handled with much greater strictness.         
	Both RSS and BJP workers agree that Bhagwat has got the reins at a very critical juncture. They also feel that Bhagwat and the new general secretary, Bhaiyya Joshi, have no political ambition or linkages whatsoever and hence they will be able to take an objective view of the situation. Their stress will be on expansion of the RSS and strengthening of the ideological position, rather than interference in the BJPs day-to-day affairs.         
	Sources say the picture will get clear tomorrow after the direction of Bhagwats first speech and the appointment of joint secretaries. If a new joint secretary is appointed in place of Suresh Soni to deal with the BJP, equations are bound to change in the BJP power struggle. But all the effects will be visible only after the election.         
	Bhagwat, 59, who will be the sixth RSS chief, is the youngest to assume the top post after M.S. Golwalkar. He became general secretary in 2000 when Sudarshan, an electronics and telecommunication engineer, took over as chief from Rajendra Singh. Bhagwat, who hails from Chandrapur in Vidarbha, has a graduation degree in veterinary sciences and animal husbandry.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Maoist mission minus Rambo
                                                                                                               Maoist mission minus Rambo
  - Signal for police and air force operations against rebels      SUJAN DUTTA                          Advanced Light Helicopters of the air forces Sarang aerobatics team perform at the IAF Day Parade at the Hindon airbase in Ghaziabad on Thursday. Prem Singh                                        
	New Delhi, Oct. 8: The government today took stock of the Maoist threat and signalled that central and state police forces and the Indian Air Force would go into mission-specific operations that, in the words of Air Chief Marshal Pradeep Vasant Naik, will not be Rambo-style.        
	The Cabinet Committee on Security chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met here for two-and-a-half hours this afternoon specifically to discuss the Naxal issue, national security adviser M.K. Narayanan said.        
	The meeting was on even as reports that Naxals had killed 17 policemen in Gadchiroli were trickling in.        
	Union home minister P. Chidambaram was understood to have given a briefing on the progress in operations in Chhattisgarh, where state and Central CoBRA forces undertook Operation Greenhunt last month, and the arrests of major suspected Maoists such as Khobad Ghandy and Chhattradhar Mahato.        
	The Union home minister is also understood to have roadmapped operations that required cohesive action by the local administration and the Centre in zones covering inter-state boundaries across Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Maharashtra and West Bengal. Central forces deployed in Maharashtra for the Assembly elections on October 13 may be re-deployed to zones where the Maoists are active.        
	The Indian Air Forces request for permission to open fire on Naxals in self-defence also figured in the discussions but it is the defence ministry that is still examining the proposal, defence minister A.K. Antony said.        
	Earlier, speaking at a function to mark the 77th Air Force Day before the meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security, Air Chief Marshal Naik said guns manned by specially raised commandos of the Indian Air Force would be mounted in Mi17 and Mi171V helicopters. He emphasised that it is not a free for all and we are very categorical that we are not looking for Rambo-style operations.        
	The IAF chief alluded to the fictional character John Rambo, a Vietnam war veteran portrayed by Sylvester Stallone, in a series of blood-and-gore films that shows the ex-special forces soldier destroying enemies single-handed using a combination of guerrilla tactics, muscle and firepower.        
	We are totally against using the armed forces for internal security situations and there are very stringent stipulations, said Naik.        
	Defence minister Antony said: The armed forces are deployed in Jammu and Kashmir and in the Northeast and we do not want to enlarge their area of operations. He said the IAFs proposal for permission to open fire in self-defence is with the ministry of defence and we are examining it.        
	But the air chief said in the morning that the IAFs Garuda would be in the helicopters. The Garuda is the IAFs commando unit and the youngest special force raised by the military after a raid by militants on an airbase in Kashmir. The brief of the Garuda is to protect aircrew and assets of the IAF.        
	It is likely that the Mi17 and Mi171V helicopters will be armed with light and medium machine guns.

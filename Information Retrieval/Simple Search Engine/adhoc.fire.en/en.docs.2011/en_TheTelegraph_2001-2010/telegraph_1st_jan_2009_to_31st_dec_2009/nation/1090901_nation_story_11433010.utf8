	New Delhi, Aug. 31: A man who raped a teenager while living as an illegal immigrant in Germany and then gave police the slip has been finally tracked down, 12 years after his night of crime.        
	When police turned up at his doorstep in the Indian capital last night, Jaswant Singhs first reaction was shock. The 36-year-old, now a well-to-do businessman married with two kids, never thought he would be caught.        
	The arrest came on a tip-off from German police and after a painstaking probe that involved going through documents the German embassy in Delhi had forwarded to the Indian foreign ministry.        
	When we arrested Singh and confronted him with the details given to us, he confessed to his crime, DCP (crime) Neeraj Thakur said.        
	Police sources said Singh left for Germany in 1992. Refused political asylum, he continued to stay illegally and worked as a chef in a restaurant in Pfungstadt.        
	The town made headlines on August 2, 1997, after Singh, along with two co-workers, an Indian named Karan Singh and a Pakistani called Mohammad Shahzad, gangraped the 17-year-old. The girl had missed her last train home and was walking back around 1 when they pounced on her.        
	A German court jailed Karan and Shahzad in 1998, but Singh escaped to India via Holland. He settled down, got married in 2000 and started his transport business.        
	Suspecting that he had returned to India, the German embassy forwarded the records of the case to the Indian foreign ministry last year. Delhi police spent close to eight months tracking him in Hoshiarpur as Singhs birthplace was Miani in the Punjab district. They later found that he had settled in Delhi after returning from Germany.        
	It was a painstaking probe as Jaswant Singh is a common name and we didnt even have his picture, DCP Thakur said. He said Singh would be tried in an Indian court under Indian laws as German authorities hadnt asked for his extradition.

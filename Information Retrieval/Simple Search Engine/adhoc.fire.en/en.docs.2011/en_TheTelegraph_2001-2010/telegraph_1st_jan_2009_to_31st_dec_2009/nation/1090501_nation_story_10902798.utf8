The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong to Karat: Door not closed
                                                                                                               Cong to Karat: Door not closed
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN AND JAYANTH JACOB                              
	New Delhi, April 30: The Congress today said its doors were not closed on Prakash Karat, signalling a realisation that the party may need Left support after the May 16 election results.        
	I know Mr Karat has some reservations about our Prime Minister but that does not mean our doors have been closed for him. It (his reservations) will melt down, the Congresss chief spokesperson, M. Veerappa Moily, said.        
	They (the Left) have reservations because of the nuclear deal; they were totally against it. But today or yesterday, they said they would make suitable amendments but not scrap the deal. The Left is as interested in the country as we are. Its country first for them and us.        
	The reference was to Karats statement yesterday that the Left would rework the 123 Agreement and may not be keen on scrapping it, as reported by PTI.        
	Asked if the Congress might do a rethink on Manmohan Singh becoming Prime Minister to bring the Left around, Moily said: The country is comfortable with him.        
	Pressed about the possibility of a second renunciation (after Sonia Gandhis in 2004) that would see Singh forgo the top job, Moily said: He never aspired to be PM. He is a selfless man. But we will not get into a discussion on that issue.        
	Congress sources said the Left would be important after the polls even if its tally fell to 30 from the current 60. Anything less than 30 would naturally diminish their importance and we would then, perhaps, not have to reach out to them, a party strategist said. The reasons for the Congresss keenness on Left support are:        
	It believes the fourth front of Mulayam Singh Yadav, Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan will drop a large number of seats and may not be all that consequential        
	Other prospective allies still seem out of reach. Sources said that Mayavati and Jayalalithaa might prefer the BJP while the habitually cautious Nitish Kumar appeared unlikely to quickly decide to dump the BJP and call fresh polls in Bihar;        
	Every statement from Karat rejecting any truck with the Congress may, in the public perception, add to the BJPs image of a serious contender. Its incumbent on us to send signals that would obviate such perceptions, a general secretary said.

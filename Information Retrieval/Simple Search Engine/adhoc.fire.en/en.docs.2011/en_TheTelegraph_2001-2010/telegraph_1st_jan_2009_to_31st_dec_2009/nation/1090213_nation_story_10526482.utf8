                                                                                                               Seat clash keeps Jaitley on tenterhooks
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Arun Jaitley: Uncertain about the future                                  
	Patna, Feb. 12: The new BJP in-charge of Bihar affairs, Arun Jaitley, is now facing a near-revolt situation in the party ranks over the prestigious Patna Saheb seat as supporters of the two claimants take to the streets.         
	The battle to get the ticket for the seat has boiled down to two contenders  cine actor-cum-BJP politician Shatrughan Sinha and chairman of SIS, the countrys largest security agency, and party veteran R.K. Sinha.         
	Hundreds of the party workers gathered to express their support for R.K. Sinha when the latter landed at the Patna airport recently to step up his campaign for a ticket.         
	Many of his supporters shouted slogans against Shatrughan for having a soft corner for Bal Thackeray and Raj Thackeray who had triggered off violence in Maharashtra on Bihar people and students.         
	Shatrughan Sinha has announced his candidature for the Patna seat, claiming that he has already got the green signal from L. K. Advani and Rajnath Singh.         
	But R.K. Sinha, who has been preparing to contest the seat for the past three years, strongly disputed the actors claim        
	I will contest the Patna seat. I, too, have an assurance from over six senior party leaders to contest elections, he said.        
	Sources in the party said that Arun Jaitley is working hard to settle the issue ahead of the formal announcement. Jaitley, according to sources, even tried to speak to the two claimants individually. But his efforts have failed to cut the ice so far.         
	Nawada arrest        
	Police today arrested three persons in connection with the killing of 10 policemen, including officer in charge of Kauakol police station Rameshwar Ram, by Maoists at Mahulitar village in Nawada district on February 10.         
	Those arrested include Rambhuj and Jamuna Ravidas who had organised Saint Ravidass anniversary in the village, and chowkidar Sahedeo Rai.         
	The police have also detained village mukhiya Ajit Yadav for interrogation. The Maoists had spared Ajit and his armed bodyguard even though they were standing very close to the policemen killed by the Maoists.

	Lucknow, July 19: An 18-year-old died and some 100 were injured as youths seeking army jobs faced bullets today, not in the battlefield but on the terrain of unemployment.        
	Soldiers opened fire at an army recruitment camp in Chandauli, 250km east of Lucknow, after the 10,000-15,000 candidates pulled down the boundary wall alleging favouritism in selection and stoned and injured some 30 officers, the army said.        
	As one unidentified youth died and several others were hit, the job seekers ran wild in the town, smashing and torching vehicles, vandalising the district court and railway station and disrupting trains, including some on the Delhi-Howrah route, for five hours.        
	The unofficial death toll is two apart from 150 injured, including 50 soldiers and officers. The army spokeseprson in Chandauli, however, claimed the soldiers had fired in the air.        
	The endemic joblessness in backward eastern Uttar Pradesh had been drawing 10,000 to 15,000 youths every day to the nine-day recruitment drive since it began on July 13. The army, which conducted physical and written tests at the camp at Mahendra Polytechnic, planned to recruit about 3,500 youths.        
	It was the desperation for jobs that probably lay behind the violence  when some candidates were rejected after the 1,600m run a little before 9am, they came out and provoked the others, said Brigadier S.K. Thapa, who was in charge of the recruitment process.        
	We faced a violent crowd of 10,000 youths fed by the rumour of irregularities, said Paramjit Singh, an officer.        
	After things quietened in the afternoon, an army spokesperson said the recruitment drive had been suspended and would later resume in nearby Varanasi.        
	The state government alleged the army had not informed it about the drive beforehand. Cabinet secretary Shashank Shekhar Singh said chief minister Mayavati had written to the Centre to ensure the army co-ordinate with the local administration (in future) so that such incidents do not recur.        
	Although todays incident shows there is a huge demand for non-officer army jobs, the armed forces face a serious shortage of officers that has even led to suggestions that India bring in conscription.        
	Many countries have a system of conscription, under which all fit young men have to compulsorily serve in the armed forces at a particular age during peacetime (and a wider range of the population during wars). The US, where this was called Draft, did away with the system in 1973.        
	No one had been arrested till evening for the days violence.        
	The mob burnt down a State Bank of India ATM, the circle officers office and a signal cabin and a parcel room at Chandauli railway station, stopping train services between 9am and 2pm.         
	At the district court, the protesters set fire to files. More than 12 motorcycles and a railway truck were torched while the district magistrates vehicle escaped narrowly.        
	The state government has ordered a magisterial inquiry.

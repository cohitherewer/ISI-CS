	New Delhi, June 15: Health officials scrambled today to prevent Indias first cluster of pandemic influenza from emerging in Jalandhar, where seven teenagers who returned from a school trip to America are infected with the new H1N1 virus.         
	The teenagers, under quarantine at a government hospital in the Punjab industrial hub, are among a group of 31 children from a school in Jalandhar who flew into India on Saturday after the US visit and developed flu symptoms yesterday.         
	State health staff visited the homes of all the children who have flu symptoms early this morning and gave the anti-viral drug oseltamivir to 196 family members and close relatives, Amarjeet Kaur, regional director of health, said.         
	All the infected teenagers appear to have picked up the infection during their trip. However, the large number of simultaneous infections has triggered fears of a local cluster  defined as two or more persons showing flu symptoms within 14 days in the same geographical area and linked.        
	A cluster could emerge if the children passed on the virus to their contacts before they developed symptoms.         
	There is no evidence yet for a cluster (from local transmission), said a senior health officer in New Delhi. But we have asked the district authorities to remain vigilant.        
	A central rapid response team has gone to Jalandhar to assist district health authorities in implementing guidelines aimed at preventing the local spread of the infection.         
	In a meeting to review the nations state of preparedness, health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad called on chief ministers to gear up health facilities and services in their states for possible spread of the virus.         
	Health ministry sources said the states had been asked to increase the number of isolation facilities in government hospitals and prepare local rapid-response teams who could help contain any clusters that might develop.         
	Our advisory to the public to curtail non-essential travel to affected countries remains, a source said. But India has not imposed any restriction on travel, the source added.         
	The emergence of a cluster is likely to set into motion a cluster containment plan under which at least 90 per cent of the population in a 5km zone around the neighbourhood of the cluster would be given oseltamivir to prevent the infection from spreading.         
	The National Institute of Communicable Diseases today confirmed the H1N1 illness in a 45-year-old woman, an eight-year-old girl and a four-year-old girl who had travelled from the US to Hyderabad. All have very mild symptoms, a health officer in Hyderabad said.        
	India now has 30 confirmed H1N1 cases. Eleven patients have been discharged.

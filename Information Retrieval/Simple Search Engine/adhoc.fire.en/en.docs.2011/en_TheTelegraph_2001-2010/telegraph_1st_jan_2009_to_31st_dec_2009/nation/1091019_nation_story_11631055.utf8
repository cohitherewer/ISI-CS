	Bangalore, Oct. 18: Yesterday he found himself a terror suspect in an unfamiliar city hundreds of miles from home, but the Kashmiri youth from a cricket family appears to have already taken the trauma in his stride.        
	I was shocked because it was the first time something like this had happened, said Parvez Rasool, 21, who was questioned by police on the suspicion of carrying explosives into Chinnaswamy Stadium ahead of Saturdays T20 Champions League fixtures.        
	But Im relaxed now, and it was good fun going around MG Road today, the small-town youth from Bijebehara, whose two brothers are state-level cricketers too, added.        
	This was the Jammu and Kashmir under-22 cricket teams first tour outside the north zone, and it had had the young players all excited. That changed after arriving in Bangalore, when they found themselves at the centre of a bomb alert after a detector at the stadium apparently picked up a signal of explosives emanating from Parvezs kit bag.        
	We had a meeting today, and I told the players to take it (the incident) as part of the game, said Abdul Qayoom, the teams coach and former Jammu and Kashmir Ranji captain. The team is now at a hotel, having vacated its rooms at the stadium complex.        
	The police had let Parvez off after nearly six hours of questioning yesterday, but confiscated his kit bag and sent it for forensic analysis. The report may take another couple of days, the police said.        
	Calls were pouring in from worried family members back home, Qayoom said. Ive been Parvezs coach since he was 12. Hes not involved in anything.        
	An expert had yesterday said it may have been a false positive detection, where a detector picks up vapours of a benign material and mistakenly identifies it as an explosive.        
	The team had left Srinagar for Cuttack on October 9 to play Orissa, and was to play Karnataka on October 21.        
	Last year, the team had qualified for the elite group, and this was their first tournament outside the north zone, Qayoom said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Policy to let information flow without asking
                                                                                                               Policy to let information flow without asking
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                           Singh                                  
	New Delhi, June 11: Transparency mandarins in the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) have won a protracted argument with home and defence ministry officials over throwing open non-strategic data for public use.         
	The department of science and technology, which functions under the PMO, is putting final touches on an open data policy that will unlock a whole ocean of information hitherto withheld. One of the 100-day promises made in the Presidents address to Parliament, the open data policy will be placed for cabinet approval soon, sources said.         
	In terms of a transparency effort, the open data policy marks a quantum improvement on the RTI because it will institutionalise voluntary disclosure of information by the government.         
	With RTI, you need to apply, wait and in many cases even pay for information you receive, said a top official, explaining the difference. Once the open data policy becomes operational, anyone will automatically be able to access information through the Net, or other means like hard copy and CDs.         
	Manmohan Singhs PMO has been pushing the open data policy for several years now but was being resisted by the home and defence ministries which have traditionally been zealous about keeping things under wraps. Theyve apparently been convinced that nothing they consider of strategic value or critical to national security will come under the purview of the new transparency regime.         
	There is tonnes and tonnes of information which is non-strategic that the government still keeps away from public access, the official said, there is no virtue in such secrecy, in fact there is virtue in making it available, free information is critical to our development requirements, especially now that so many non-government and civil society groups have become partners in pushing us ahead.         
	Some of the non-strategic areas in which government still withholds information are geology, mapping, health and education, water resources, and industrial profiling. There is a whole lot of human development index data too that we uselessly keep away from public access and waste, in the right hands, all of this and more could be hugely beneficial to society, the official said.         
	The Prime Minister himself underlined the need for greater transparency and accountability in an interaction with his team of officials this afternoon. It was like a general body meeting of the PMO with all officials above director rank present; national security adviser M.K. Narayanan also participated.         
	The exact contours and architecture of the open data policy are unclear at the moment even to those who are involved with giving it shape. These things tend to slowly evolve in government, said the official, the critical thing is that once a decisive push has been given, they develop their own dynamic, the nuts and bolts fall into place.         
	A major task of the department of science and technology, overseen by Prithviraj Chavan, a minister of state in the PMO and himself an engineering graduate from Berkeley, will be to provide the roadmap for translating such a huge undertaking into reality. The information overload and backlog with government is monumental, the simple task of putting all of that on-line, for instance, is a daunting one, the official said.         
	An open data policy, on the lines of executive measures taken by the Barack Obama administration in the United States, has been a growing demand of transparency lobbyists in India.        
	One of them, Venkatesh Hariharan, who calls himself an open-source evangelist, says: While the BJP did not win the elections, one of the proposals that I really liked within their IT Vision was that of replacing the Right to Information Act with a Duty to Inform Act that puts the onus on the government to share information with its citizens. In the long run, I think this is the way to go and with the technology at our disposal, we no longer have excuses to keep public data out of the reach of Indian citizens.         
	The open data policy, implemented in its spirit, might come close to meeting such aspirations. At the moment, even things like maps are difficult to access besides being expensive, Hariharan says, Maps in combination with other data can help tremendously. For example, there is currently a fear that the swine flu might start spreading. If data on this threat is available, it can be overlaid onto maps and this can help us understand how the disease is spreading.         
	Ravi Gupta, editor of e-Gov magazine and another transparency campaigner, argues that the government itself will be the biggest beneficiary of an open data policy. The way things are organised today, government departments themselves cannot access information from each other, the first and biggest gainers from a more organised and open system of putting information in the public domain will be the government itself. Our issue is not even an open data policy at the moment, our real issue is organising the data in systematic fashion, that itself will be a huge favour the government will be doing itself.         
	Gupta also reasons that India should follow the US-model of making data accessible to the public at the cost of dissemination rather than the cost of collection. Our entrepreneurs or researchers or social sector organisations are not really spoilt for resources, he says, to have to pay heavy prices for information may nullify the whole idea. I know of an instance in Bihar where an RTI applicant had to pay Rs 5 lakh for information sought on account of photocopying charges. Thats legitimate on the governments part, but it also drives away information seekers. A voluntary data policy might correct that.

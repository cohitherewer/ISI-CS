The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Little stars doll up for Slumdogs Kodak moment

	Los Angeles, Feb. 20: All the children from the cast of Slumdog Millionaire are being flown from Mumbai to Los Angeles at the producers expense and are expected to go up on stage en masse if, as widely tipped, the movie wins Best Picture, it has been revealed.        
	Make-up artist Virginia Holmes, from Fat Mu, the company which was responsible for the general look and the hair in Slumdog, let a fairly badly kept secret out of the bag. All the children from the film will be there  which will be lovely to see, Holmes told The Telegraph.        
	The logic is elementary.        
	Critics of Slumdog have used the child actors to bash Danny Boyle, the films director, over the head by accusing him of exploiting the children by allegedly not paying them enough. He hotly denied the charges.        
	They got so nasty that plans to bring the children to Bafta in London were quietly shelved. Now, that the academy members have all voted  the deadline was 5pm on February 17, west coast time  bringing the children will not actually harm Slumdogs Oscar chances.

	Boyle will also make a powerful point to a global audience running into hundreds of millions in 200-odd countries by taking the children along the red carpet and hopefully up on to the stage at the Kodak Theatre.        
	All might change, of course, before Sunday but the children could be taken to local funfairs afterwards and bought ice-cream and do all the things that the overweight children of rich Indians do when they come from India to California.        
	In Los Angeles, a local newspaper confirmed: If the film wins the Best Picture Oscar, all nine of the youthful performers are expected to join producer Christian Colson on the stage of the Kodak Theatre. It went on: Colson, distributor Fox Searchlight and director Danny Boyle had worried that a trip to Los Angeles for the Screen Actors Guild Awards (where Slumdog Millionaire won the ensemble prize) and the Oscars (where Slumdog Millionaire has 10 nominations) might further complicate the already difficult lives of two children cast from Mumbais slums.        
	However, after weighing the implications of bringing its youngest, poorest Indian actors to the academy awards, the makers of Slumdog Millionaire have decided to do so, and now expect the films entire cast to arrive in time for Sunday nights Oscar ceremony.

	If the children are seen to be having fun before the worlds camera, it would be a befitting reply to those who have carped and nagged about the child actors.        
	The filmmakers and the studio eventually decided that they would invite and pay for the transportation of the films entire cast, rather than bringing in a select few.         
	We decided it was better to include everybody, Michelle Hooper, Fox Searchlights publicity chief, was quoted as telling local media. But officials are officials. It was apparently difficult to arrange for transit, as not all of the children have visas, and not all of their parents are able to leave India, either for health or legal reasons.         
	According to Hooper, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has been especially generous in finding tickets for the cast and crew  this could be taken as a sign by some that Slumdog has won though the results are supposed to be secret until the envelope is opened.        
	The child actors include Rubina Ali, who plays the films youngest Latika, and Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail, who plays its youngest Salim. The others include Madhur Mittal (oldest Salim), Ashutosh Lobo Gajiwala (middle Salim), Tanvi Ganesh Lonkar (middle Latika), Tanay Chheda (middle Jamal) and Ayush Mahesh Khedekar (youngest Jamal).        
	Meanwhile, the film location, Mumbai, which suffered after the terrorist attacks on November 26 last year, is also proving to be a winner, according to a leading UK flight search engine, Skyscanner. The companys search data shows a doubling in flight searches to India following the release of Slumdog Millionaire.        
	Slumdog, which has already won seven Baftas and four Golden Globes, is giving Indias tourist trade a particularly timely boost. Skyscanner quoted moviegoer Jane Leyton from Edinburgh: Watching Slumdog Millionaire made me want to visit India  it just looked so exotic.        
	Whether the quote is really genuine is hard to ascertain but Slumdog appears to be compensating for the damage that was done by Pakistaniterrorists.

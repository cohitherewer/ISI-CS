The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Insurgent bid to sway voters
                                                                                                               Insurgent bid to sway voters
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	Namsai (Lohit), Oct. 13: A Myanmar insurgent outfit is alleged to have tried to influence voters in two Arunachal districts where Naga rebels have long been accused of attempting to dictate ballot choices.        
	Cadres of the Kachin Independent Army (KIA) were said to have crossed over into Tirap and Changlang, along the Myanmar border, and asked people to vote for particular candidates.        
	During todays high-security voting, however, sources said the cadres couldnt influence or intimidate the voters in the two districts, home to 12 Assembly seats.        
	The KIA is said to have close ties with National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Khaplang) faction, which has a strong presence in the area. The sources said the NSCN (K) chief S.S. Khaplang had roots in the Hemi Naga group of Myanmar.        
	Changlang police chief K. Aya acknowledged that the Naga rebels influenced voters, but not the KIA. We have Naga and Manipuri (rebel) groups who perhaps have tie-ups with the KIA. Fortunately, the elections have passed off peacefully, he said.        
	Ahead of the last polls, though, around 100 KIA cadres were said to have descended on Changlang villages and influenced the voters.        
	The Myanmar rebels are known to have local connections, the sources said. One KIA leader is said to be an Assamese married to a Kachin woman who is related to the influential Singphos in Changlang.        
	Kachins control huge swathes of opium-growing land and, with the ruling Myanmar military junta having little control on large parts of the Kachin and Shan states, the KIA has had a free run. Some of the opium is smuggled into Arunachal and Nagaland. Insurgent groups from all of Northeast are known to seek shelter in the Kachin rebel camps.        
	Todays polling, though, was largely smooth, officials said. There were no reports of disturbances from sensitive polling stations, said an official in Changlang.        
	But it wasnt peaceful until yesterday. Supporters of Newlai Tingkhatra, the Congress candidate from Tiraps Kanubari seat, were summoned by activists of the NSCNs Isak-Muivah (IM) faction.         
	They had misbehaved with our boys so we called them over and they apologised. They have already left and it is wrong to call it abduction, a senior NSCN (IM) leader said over phone from Dimapur. The NSCN (IM) claims Tirap and Changlang to be part of its concept of Nagalim, which includes contiguous Naga-inhabited areas in Assam, Manipur, Arunachal and even parts of Myanmar.

	Dhaka, Aug. 16 (PTI): A Bangladesh court today ordered a halt to an army pullout from a restive Chittagong tribal pocket over threats to Bengali-speaking settlers.        
	The troops in the south-eastern Chittagong hills were being withdrawn in line with a landmark 1997 peace accord that had ended over two decades of tribal insurgency. The pact was signed during current Prime Minister Sheikh Hasinas tenure from 1996 to 2001.        
	The court issued the order on two petitions by Jamaat-e-Islami leader Abdur Razzak amid reports of protests by the Bengali settlers who feared for their safety despite assurances that extra police forces would be deployed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Political card in aircraft dogfight
                                                                                                               Political card in aircraft dogfight
  - Makers of Eurofighter up the ante on the ground to beat American contenders in the race for $11-billion air force contract           SUJAN DUTTA                               File pictures of a Boeing F/A-18 E/F Superhornet (top) and a Eurofighter Typhoon				                                       
	New Delhi, Aug. 17: The great duel in the skies for an Indian Air Force order that could top $11 billion for 126 fighter aircraft began in Bangalore today, but the real action is being worked out in boardrooms of aviation majors.        
	At least one of the six competitors in the race, EADS, is saying upfront that it will gift-wrap its offer of the Eurofighter Typhoon for the IAF with a political package.        
	All such deals have a technical dimension as well as a political dimension, chief executive officer of EADS defence and security, Bernhard Gerwert, told The Telegraph recently. EADS had flown Indian journalists to the Royal International Air Tattoo in Fairford, the UK, and to the German assembly plant at Manching last month to demonstrate the capabilities of the Eurofighter Typhoon.        
	What that package will be is still being worked out. But an association with EADS means that India is associating with the governments of four countries in Europe and that can go a long way, said Gerwert. The governments and the air forces of the UK, Germany, Italy and Spain collaborate to make the Eurofighter Typhoon.        
	EADS is upping the ante in the race for the IAF order because of a perception that the US, with its clout and the growing proximity of Indian and US military forces, could swing the deal towards one of the two American competitors - the F-16 IN Super Viper made by Lockheed Martin or the Boeing F/A-18 E/F Superhornet.        
	Lt General Klaus-Peter Stieglitz, the chief of staff of the Luftwaffe, the German air force, was also forthright: The political package has to be negotiated; as we did with Austria and Switzerland. But it is still quite early.        
	The Eurofighter is a precious customer in Austria and is vying for an order from Switzerland for which the flight trials are over. The clinching of the End-User Monitoring and Verification Agreement between America and India is being seen by the competitors of the US as the latest symbol of the political closeness between the two countries and their militaries.        
	What the political package can be is yet to be defined. But EADS, at least, and the French government  which recently hosted a contingent of the Indian armed forces and the Prime Minister on Bastille Day  are convinced that it has to be a substantial concession. This could be, for example, a re-alignment of the European position on Jammu and Kashmir, bringing it closer to Indias stand. But no one is talking about that yet.        
	In Bangalore today, the IAFs principal director, Air Staff Requirements at the Air Headquarters, Air Commodore Rakesh Dhir, began supervising the flight tests on the F/A-18 Superhornet.        
	Boeing Integrated Defence Systems has flown two US aircraft to the south Indian city that is also home to Hindustan Aeronautics and the Aircraft Systems and Testing Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation. This is one of the seven schools of its kind in the world, to which the IAF seconds its test pilots.        
	Two test pilots, a group captain and a wing commander, will take turns flying the Superhornet and, later in September, the F-16 and the Russian MiG 35. Two other top guns will put the Eurofighter, the French Rafale and the Swedish JAS-39C Gripen to tests.        
	The flight evaluations are scheduled to be completed by April next year, after which the IAF evaluation team will fly to the home countries of the manufacturers, or any other designated site, to test weapon systems and armaments.        
	The flight evaluation tests begin after the technical paperwork of each of the six contestants is found to be in order by the defence ministry. A senior officer at Air Headquarters said the aircraft would be flown out of Bangalore, Jaisalmer and Leh for testing in normal, hot and cold weather conditions.        
	The performance of each of the aircraft will be quantified for take-offs, sustained turns and tight turns.        
	Sample missions will be assigned to the aircraft for ground strike, maritime strike, air-defence/air-superiority, acceleration and climb performance.        
	We might assign, for example, an aircraft to accelerate from 0.8 mach to 1.42 mach within a specified time (seconds), the officer said. One mach is the speed of sound.        
	The evaluation will also assess systems navigation, radar abilities, self-defence suits, electronic warfare systems and the ability of the aircraft to carry extra load (weapons, bombs).        
	One of the requirements to evaluate the multi-role ability of the aircraft is whether they are capable of carrying and dropping big 2000-pounder bombs at designated ground targets.        
	The tests have to be tabulated and the results brought out statistically, said the officer.        
	After this, the IAF will ask for the MTBF  mean time between failures  to arrive at the cost of operating each of the aircraft over the period they are to be in service, an estimated 40 years. This is the first time that the IAF has adopted lifecycle costing or cost of ownership to conclude the expenses to be incurred on each aircraft.        
	This is primarily because of the IAFs experience with Russian equipment, so far the Indian militarys mainstay. The top brass and the defence establishment adopted the cost-of-ownership method because they concluded that Russian equipment were cheaper off the shelf but more expensive in service life because of shortages in spares and back-ups.        
	A major concern of the competitors has been how the IAF will attempt to fix the cost-of-ownership of twin-engine aircraft like the Superhornet, the Rafale, the MiG 35 and the Eurofighter with single-engine aircraft like the Super Viper and the Gripen.        
	The single-engine aircraft will clearly be much cheaper. But air headquarters sources say the costs will also be offset against performance because twin-engine aircraft will be more powerful and are expected to be more versatile, if heavier.

	Washington, Jan. 20: Barack Obama has quickly moved to fulfil his key campaign promise of restoring the law and the sanctity of the Constitution as the 44th US President by choosing an Indian American as a key instrument in achieving this objective.        
	Shortly before his swearing-in, the Obama transition team decided to appoint Neal Katyal as the new administrations principal deputy solicitor-general.        
	Katyal is a Georgetown University law professor, but he is known to most Americans as a high-profile advocate for alleged terrorist detainees in Guantanamo.        
	Also late last night, only hours before Obamas swearing-in, Indian American Preeta Bansal, who was solicitor-general of New York state under the Clinton administration, was appointed general counsel and senior policy adviser in the White House Office of Management and Budget. Bansal is a friend of Obama from his days at Harvard Law School.        
	Neither position requires confirmation by the US Senate. So the two Indian Americans start work along with the new President on his very first day in office.        
	Katyals appointment is a strong signal from Obama that he will depart sharply from day one from the terrorist detention and interrogation policies of the Bush administration.        
	This was a promise that Obama made during his two-year-long quest for the US presidency. In recent days, his base had nearly revolted over signals that Obama may go back on this promise and delay closure of the much-reviled Guantanamo prison in Cuba.        
	It is now expected that orders to close down the prison will go out during Obamas first week in office. Katyals choice is a signal that Obama intends to stick to his campaign promises in this regard.        
	Katyal became a well-known figure nationally after his appearance before the US Supreme Court against detentions in Guantanamo when he delivered a stinging rebuke against George W. Bushs broad assertion of wartime power.        
	He has also regularly appeared on national television defending his position.        
	A logical choice for the job Katyal is taking would have been Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs daughter Amrit, who, like Katyal, has fought in recent years against the Bush administrations detention policies and alleged torture of detainees. It is not known, however, if the low-profile Amrit Singh was approached by the administration at any stage        
	Bansal, 42, was by Obamas side during most of his two-year-long quest for the US presidency. She was the second in command on immigration matters during Obamas primary campaign for the Democratic nomination as deputy head of the campaigns immigration policy advisory committee.        
	In her new post, Bansal would have an office in the White House complex itself. Until her new appointment, Bansal was a partner at the New York law firm, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher amp; Fom.        
	She was also a member of the statutory US Commission for International Religious Freedom.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, March 26: CPM politburo member and Citu head M.K. Pandhe today said mistakes committed by the party in Bengal and Kerala could come in the way of good results in the Lok Sabha polls.         
	Pandhe, along with politburo member Mohammed Amin, was releasing the CPMs campaign booklets that accuse the UPA of doing little for workers and the urban poor.         
	The head of the partys trade union wing then talked about the worker- and farmer-friendly measures taken by the Bengal and Kerala governments. Asked if such measures would bring more seats to the party in these states, Pandhe said: It should. But we have committed some errors. Some mistakes.         
	He said: The Nandigram firing, which Buddhadeb (Bhattacharjee) himself admitted (was a mistake). In Kerala, the politburo had suspended our chief minister and party state secretary. Which party will take such decisions?         
	But Pandhe refused to say anything more, pointing out that the news conference was about workers issues.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PAN   scan on poll princes

	New Delhi, May 8: Khimji Bhai Patadiya, Abu Azmi and Surendra Babu are all rupee billionaires. The similarity doesnt end there: none quotes a PAN.        
	Around 3,444 candidates havent listed income-tax permanent account numbers (PAN) in their nomination affidavits, raising eyebrows in the finance ministry. The affidavits dont cover those for the final phase on May 13.        
	Revenue sleuths are scanning their affidavits with the Election Commission to see if any of these candidates have evaded tax. They will also scrutinise the tax returns of select crorepati candidates whose declarations seem suspicious.        
	One official said the exercise would begin in earnest once the elections were over. We need to track many of them and we will be asking our offices to take a look at their tax returns.        
	The penalty for not having a PAN card  mandatory even for those who have income below the taxable limit  is only Rs 10,000. For tax evasion, though, the fine is 100 to 300 per cent of the money concealed.        
	Former chief election commissioner N. Gopalaswami said the matter wasnt about money but the sanctity of the polls.         
	Its not a question of money. What is of concern is whether the money is legal. If it is illegally earned, it is probably being used in elections.        
	The PAN hole in affidavits comes in an election that has seen possibly the highest number of crorepatis in the fray.         
	However, revenue officials dont rule out the possibility that for many of the rich candidates, the wealth could be inherited or earned from business interests with clean tax records.        
	If the affidavits are anything to go by, the candidates have dwarfed the MPs of the last Lok Sabha, who averaged Rs 1.6 crore in assets.        
	Gopalaswami said if there were discrepancies between the poll filings and actual wealth, the tax department could prosecute the candidates. One problem is that people declare income or wealth but not the source, he pointed out.         
	The declaration of Khimji Bhai Patadiya does not mention the PAN. The Independent candidate from Gujarats Surendranagar has assets of Rs 514 crore. He owns land worth Rs 259 crore and a fleet of cars.         
	Abu Azmi, the Samajwadi Party nominee from Mumbai North West, also hasnt listed his PAN. According to Election Watch, he is worth around Rs 124 crore.         
	In the same league is Surendra Babu of the Janata Dal (Secular), battling it out from Bangalore North. He is said to be the eighth richest candidate with assets of Rs 108 crore. The BSPs Deepak Bhardwaj, a hotelier and realtor who contested from West Delhi and is possibly the richest candidate, declaring assets of over Rs 603 crore.         
	Both Bhardwaj and Patadia have faced past cases, though nothing has been proved against them, claims NGO Election Watch. Bhardwaj was accused of cheating and dishonesty in property deals, while Khimji faced extortion charges, according to the NGO.

	Patna, Feb. 9: Maoists triggered a landmine blast on a police team, killing at least 10 of them, at Mahulitar village in rebel-dominated Nawada district on the Bihar-Jharkhand border this afternoon.        
	Inspector-general of police (Patna) Sunil Kumar, who was on way to the spot with reinforcements, confirmed the toll and loot of 11 weapons from the men in uniform.        
	The deceased included four Special Auxiliary Force (SAF) jawans, four jawans of Bihar Military Police, Kauwakol police station officer-in-charge Rameshwar Ram and an assistant sub-inspector.         
	Police sources said hundreds of Maoists, hiding in bushes and hills had laid siege to Mahulitar  on the border of Nawada, Jamui and Jharkhands Giridih districts  celebrating saint Ravidass birth anniversary. The rebels had also planted landmines on the approach road to the village, 230km from here.        
	The Naxalites triggered the landmine when a police patrol vehicle with about 14 jawans, including those belonging to the SAF, reached close to the spot around 2pm. The police jeep was thrown up into the air and eight of its occupants died on the spot.         
	The sources said Ram survived for a while after receiving multiple injuries, but died even before his colleagues could re-group to take care of him. The rebels, lurking in the bushes, also opened fire on the police party, which was going to the village to supervise the ceremony and also carry out general patrolling.        
	Additional director-general of police (headquarters) Neelmani said the police fired on the rebels. But it is still premature to confirm the exact number of casualties among Maoists as well as policemen. Police forces are still engaged in an encounter, he said He added that additional forces from Jamui and neighbouring police stations had been rushed. Director-general of police D.N. Gautam convened an emergency meeting of the police top brass.         
	Following reports that the Maoists had moved towards Jharkhand, Giridih superintendent of police A.V. Minz said all borders were sealed.

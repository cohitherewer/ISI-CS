The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sadhvi link in   Diwali-eve Goa blast
                                                                                                               Sadhvi link in   Diwali-eve Goa blast
                                  
	Panaji, Oct. 17 (PTI): Four persons of a Hindutva group linked to Malegaon blast accused sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur have been detained after an explosion that killed two members of the outfit in a Goa town.        
	Police are probing Sanatan Sansthas links to the blast in Margao around 9.30 last night when explosives kept in a scooter went off on a busy street, 30km from Panaji.        
	Police superintendent Atmaram Despande said the probe so far showed an improvised explosive device had been used and the two activists of the Sanstha who died probably wanted to target the crowded Diwali-eve market.        
	State home minister Ravi Naik said the explosives might have been meant to be planted at a designated spot.        
	He, however, said the Sanstha probably wanted to disturb a traditional Diwali-eve event, the Narakasur effigy competition in the heart of the town.         
	The blast took place a few metres from the competition venue.        
	Melgunda Patil from Maharashtra was killed in the blast while Yogesh Naik died this morning, Naik said.        
	The police raided the Sanstha ashram (its headquarters) at Ramnathi in Ponda town, 20km from Margao, and detained four people for questioning, the police said.         
	Among the detainees were Suresh Naik, brother of victim Yogesh, and Virendra Marathe, the ashram manager.        
	Suresh was the owner of the scooter in which the explosives were kept. He had bought the vehicle from a Sanstha follower, Nishad Bakle, a police officer said.        
	The Sanstha denied the allegations. Based on searches conducted at the ashram in Ramnathi, the institution is being portrayed as an accused in (the) Margao blast, its statement said. Sanatan will never encourage or support such activities in its ashram.        
	Within half an hour of the blast, a bomb disposal squad defused another bomb  attached to an electrical circuit, a clock, four gelatin sticks and a detonator  at Sancoale, 20km from the blast site. We recovered a mobile phone and other gadgets from the place where both the Sanstha activists were staying, Naik said.        
	He added that 250 people, some from Maharashtra, were present at the ashram when it was raided last night.

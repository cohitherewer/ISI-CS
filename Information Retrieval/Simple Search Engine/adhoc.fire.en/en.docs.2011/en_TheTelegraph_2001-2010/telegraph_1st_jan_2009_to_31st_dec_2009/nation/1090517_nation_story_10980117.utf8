The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | He came, he delivered and he left

          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN              
	New Delhi, May 16: The country saw an unusual political campaigner this election. A man who approached his task with thoroughness and then, job done, retreated into the background.        
	Rahul Gandhi slipped out of Delhi after the victory today. He had not been seen or heard since the last vote was cast on May 13  a surprise considering how uncharacteristically vocal he had been before and during the election.        
	Those who claim to know him say this is how Rahul is. He defines his task, carries it out without treading on anyones toes, and then doesnt stay back to hog the limelight.        
	Rahul came of age this election. He did his homework well, as evident in the way he quoted figures during his Bengal tour while criticising the Lefts performance.        
	His style once evoked scepticism among seasoned party officials. Many wondered whether his fastidiousness about details and idealistic sense of the greater good would take him far in the rough and tumble of Indian politics. Especially in Uttar Pradesh, which Rahul had chosen as a laboratory for his political and managerial ideas.        
	Then he pushed through his first big political decision  now being credited with the Congresss good showing in Mayavati country  that the party would go solo in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar even at the risk of defeat.        
	One thing seemed clear to all: Rahul was readying for a role larger than reviving the organisation in Uttar Pradesh or cleaning up the Youth Congress.        
	The young MP then ensured that all his key aides got tickets. One of them was reluctant, saying he had got a dud seat. But Rahuls point was, if these young men and women wanted to make a mark, they had to go through the grind.        
	Then, without fuss or fanfare, Rahul was pitch-forked into the national stage. He became the partys chief campaigner.        
	The roadshows of the past in Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat  spectacles that did not necessarily attract votes  were abandoned in favour of conventional rallies. He covered 230 constituencies through 106 public meetings.        
	In between, Rahul appeared to muddy the situation with the allies through statements that many took to imply that the Congress could look at new partners like the Janata Dal (United). Lalu Prasad was furious at the overture to Nitish Kumar.        
	But fears that Rahuls remarks could backfire have been proved wrong by a mandate for continuity and stability.        
	Most of his candidates won, too. Meenakshi Natarajan and Jitinder Singh, Rahuls secretaries, romped home from BJP bastions Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. Manik Tagore emerged giant-killer, defeating MDMK leader Vaiko in Tamil Nadu.        
	When the results took a clear shape, party cheerleaders began a Rahul for PM chorus. A senior general secretary suggested Rahul should get the full credit for the Congress victory. The official spokespersons, however, appear to have been advised not to apportion credit to individuals.        
	Questions on Rahuls future role, however, persist. Asked by the media, Manmohan Singh repeated that he had long wanted Rahul as a minister but had failed to coax him into accepting.        
	Singh said he would try his utmost to persuade him this time. Sonia Gandhi tactfully left the matter to the Prime Minister.        
	Some sources said that having cracked Uttar Pradesh after 20 years, Rahul would focus on building the party for the next Assembly polls rather than join the government. They said he still needed to fix Bihar, where the party won just two seats despite intense canvassing by Rahul.        
	Others felt that if Rahul were to eventually occupy the top post, he would need tutoring in governance with Singh as his guru.        
	As speculation over his future swirled in Delhi, Rahul left for Amethi to thank his voters. Before that, he made sure his Jack Russell Terrier puppy was deposited with his mother.        
	When reporters caught up with him in Uttar Pradesh, Rahul obliged them, even repeating an answer in Hindi when asked.        
	He credited the clean and honest politics symbolised by Singh for the Congress victory, and complimented L.K. Advani on a strong fight while disagreeing with his politics of changing the secular traditions. He parried questions on joining the cabinet.

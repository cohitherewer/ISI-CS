	Srinagar, Nov. 9: Omar Abdullah today accused the Centre of singling out his state in banning pre-paid mobile services on security grounds.        
	Jammu and Kashmir is not the only state in the country where you have violence. There are other states too where there is the same problem. Jammu and Kashmir has to be kept on a par with other states in respect of use of prepaid services, the chief minister told reporters in Jammu.         
	This is Omars first reaction to the ban, in force since November 1.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Statehood rumble, but no mass base
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Statehood rumble, but no mass base
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, Dec. 14: The Telangana storm that has fuelled demands of separate states has reached Bihar too, with voices being raised for the creation of Seemanchal, Mithila and Bhojpur.        
	While a Muslim leader and former MP from Kishenganj, Md Taslimuddin, has demanded the creation of Seemanchal state comprising Purnea, Araria, Katihar, Kishenganj, Supaul and Khagaria districts, a group of self-styled leaders  who have never been elected peoples representatives  have decided to stage a demonstration before Parliament on December 17 to press for the creation of Mithila state.        
	There is also a clamour in certain quarters for the creation of separate Bhojpur state comprising Bhojpuri-speaking regions of old Sahabad, old Saran and old Champaran districts and parts of eastern Uttar Pradesh.        
	Unlike Telangana  which has the backing of a movement for creating separate state from Andhra Pradesh or neighbouring Jharkhand which came into being following movement for over five decades  the demand for Seemanchal, Mithila and Bhojpur apparently lacks popular support at the grassroots level.        
	Taslimuddin claimed: My demand has a strong backing from people.         
	But Udai Singh, the MP from Purnea which Taslimuddin wishes to become Seemanchals capital, countered: Where is the movement? Have the people in the Kosi or Seemchanl region ever asked for a separate state? Taslimuddin has lost the poll and his party as well. He is simply trying to get back into the limelight.        
	Singh does not appear wide off the mark, as none of the MPs or MLAs representing the Seemanchal region  also known as Kosi belt on India-Bangladesh and India-Nepal borders  has raised the demand.        
	In fact, Taslimuddin demanded Seemanchal in 1992 also when he was out of power. However, he suddenly fell silent after Lalu Prasad got him into RJD and helped him becoming a central minister. After losing the seat in the last Lok Sabha poll, Taslimuddin left the RJD, too.         
	But the JD(U), which he wishes to join, has not so far given him any signal to join. Taslimuddin has been using the demand as a pressure tactics to stage a comeback into the ruling establishment, said a senior JD(U) leader.        
	Similarly, a body known as Akhil Bharatiya Mithila Rajya Samiti headed by one Dhankar Thakur has resolved to stage a demonstration outside Parliament on December 17 for a separate state comprising Maithili-speaking people.         
	But Thakur is hardly recognised as an established political or social leader even among the Mithila-based politicians who dominated the Lalu-Rabri regime for 15 long years and now the pillars in the Nitish Kumar rule, too.        
	We do not even recognise the likes of Thakur. We only see their names in newspapers in connection with demanding a separate state, said Santosh Jha, a senior lawyer in Patna High Court and a political figure belonging to the Mithila region.         
	Of course, we want Maithili to be in the 8th Schedule of the Indian constitution, Jha said, adding: We are proud of our language but we are proud Biharis, too.        
	There is a discussion going on in Bihars political circles that Lalu Prasad would have been the champion of a separate Bhojpur state if there existed a movement for it, as the RJD boss is by all accounts the tallest Bhojpuri-speaking leader in the state.         
	But Lalu Prasad, who has favoured creation of separate Telengana state, has not even spoken about the creation of Bhojpur.

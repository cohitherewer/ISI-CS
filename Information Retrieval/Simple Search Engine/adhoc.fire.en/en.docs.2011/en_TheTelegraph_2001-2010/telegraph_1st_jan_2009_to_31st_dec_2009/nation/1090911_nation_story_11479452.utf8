          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 10: The Supreme Court has issued contempt notice to an 87-year-old for accusing several sitting and retired judges of corruption in a case of financial dispute stretching back decades.        
	Punish me if I am lying. But please inquire into what I am saying, Nirmaljit Singh Hoon, owner of Singapore-based Hungerford, an investment trust, yesterday told a three-judge bench headed by Justice B.N. Aggarwal.         
	Hoon has been battling court cases since 1945 for the ownership of Turner Morrison Conglomerate Limited.        
	He claims he won the case right up till the Supreme Court but was defrauded with the active connivance of several judges, including a sitting Supreme Court judge.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Buses skip CNG check, catch fire
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Buses skip CNG check, catch fire
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                          A bus that caught fire in Delhi on Thursday while ferrying schoolchildren                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 1: Thousands of Delhi buses have been skipping the mandatory quarterly checks on their CNG kit, leading five buses to catch fire in the past nine days because of leaky gas tanks.        
	One was a Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) bus chartered by a school, and was carrying 40 children.        
	Asmita Maheshwari, 15, was chatting with friends on the bus on November 26 when she heard a loud noise and saw her window was on fire.        
	Fearing there was a bomb in the bus, she ran out. So did the other children  in the nick of time  but the conductor was severely burnt. Within minutes the bus was a wreck, its windowpanes shattered, seats ripped apart, tyres smouldering and roof destroyed.        
	The five bus fires involved two privately operated Blueline buses and three state-run DTC buses. Only one person  the school bus conductor  was injured because, the passengers have said, the fire was always preceded by a warning: a loud bang.        
	The commissioner (transport) of Delhi, Rajni Kant Verma, acknowledged yesterday that many CNG buses were not reporting for the quarterly checks.        
	But when reminded that DTC buses were involved in three fires, he sounded annoyed. There have been just two fires, both minor but we are taking them seriously and working towards rectifying the faults, he said.        
	Earlier, Verma had said: After faults were found with the bus design in 2006, we have introduced fire-resistant paint and are ensuring buses go in for regular checks. We are also holding depot managers responsible for lapses.        
	The first spate of bus fires in Delhi took place in 2006, four years after CNG vehicles were launched in the city following a court order. The Supreme Court-appointed Environment Protection and Control Authority (EPCA) had then detected design defects in the gas kits that were fitted to the old vehicles as part of the conversion process.        
	It asked all manufacturers to rectify the defect and bear the cost but, transport officials say, the order was hardly followed. While some operators spent their own money to correct the defects, most didnt as it would have cost around Rs 40,000. Thats why such accidents keep happening, an EPCA official said.        
	The EPCA had also laid down that every CNG vehicle must undergo quarterly checks at authorised centres. Transport officials said that of the 1.3-lakh CNG vehicles in the city  buses, autos, goods carriers and private cars over 50,000 do not do so. Some 2,000 buses havent been checked for months.        
	Getting a check done is time-consuming, and any discovery of a defect or leak will mean the operator must spend Rs 40,000-50,000.        
	An EPCA inquiry into the November 26 fire has revealed the conductor had reported a strange smell two days earlier but after cursory checks by depot mechanics, the bus was cleared to ferry schoolchildren again.        
	Many parts of the bus had rusted, and it was in no shape to run. They had even detected a CNG leak but did not get it repaired, a transport department official said.        
	The government has promised a crackdown. Buses that have undergone checks will now sport stickers on the front windscreen.        
	Only buses that sport a sticker saying CNG leakage proof will be allowed to ply. The responsibility has been given to all DTC depot managers, said transport minister Arvinder Singh Lovely.

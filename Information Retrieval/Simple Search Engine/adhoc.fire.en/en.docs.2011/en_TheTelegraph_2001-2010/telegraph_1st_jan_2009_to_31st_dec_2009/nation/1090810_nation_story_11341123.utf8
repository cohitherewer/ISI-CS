	Patna, Aug. 9: There was an indication that the Bihar government might declare over two dozen districts as drought hit after an all-party meeting was convened on the issue, chaired by chief minister Nitish Kumar today.        
	However, at the meeting it was decided that the chief minister would hold a cabinet meeting tomorrow to officially declare the exact number of districts as drought hit.        
	As many as 27 of the states 38 districts have recorded scant rainfall this year. The government fears the loss of at least 50 per cent of its paddy production this year, said the deputy chief minister, Sushil Kumar Modi, to reporters at the end of the meeting.        
	According to the relief code, every family in a drought-hit district is entitled a quintal of foodgrain and Rs 250 in cash.        
	Emerging from the meeting, the chief minister announced that an all-party delegation would soon submit a memorandum to the central government furnishing details of the situation in the state. Subsequently, the state government, too, will place its demand for a special package before the Centre to deal with the situation, Nitish said.        
	He added that all parties had agreed to be united in their work for the relief of the people suffering from the calamity.         
	The government has already demanded a special package of Rs 9,000 crore from the Centre to deal with the draught situation in the state. Though large parts of the state have been witnessing rains for the past three days, experts believe that protracted absence of rains has already done its damage.         
	Even if the state gets 300mm of rain in August it can be able to save only 50 per cent of the kharif crops, an expert said.        
	Talking to reporters today, Nitish Kumar did not appear too hopeful regarding Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs nod to state governments demand for a special category status, when an all-party delegation from Bihar met him yesterday.        
	However, the Prime Minister looked attentive to the demand of a special package to the state, according to members who were part of the all-party delegation yesterday.        
	Deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi said that the state government would need a substantial fund in case of it declaring its districts as draught hit.         
	The government can not meet the needs of a vast multitude of people in the drought-hit districts on its own. The Centre must step in to our rescue, he said.        
	At the meeting the Bihars Opposition also raised related issues of price rise, black marketing of essential commodities and corruption, in answer to which the state government announced that they would set up of a special cell to register complaints and initiate actions.

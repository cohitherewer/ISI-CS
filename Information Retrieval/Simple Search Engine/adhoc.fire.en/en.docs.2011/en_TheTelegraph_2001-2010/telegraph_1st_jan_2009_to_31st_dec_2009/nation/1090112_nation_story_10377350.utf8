The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Saeed arrest extended
                                                                                                               Saeed arrest extended
  - Nothing to produce in court against detained 6: Official                             Saeed                                  
	Lahore, Jan. 11 (Agencies): Pakistani authorities have extended the house arrest of Lashkar-e-Toiba chief Hafiz Saeed by 60 days, but explained this is because they have no evidence against him yet to produce in court.        
	The detentions of five other senior officials of the Jamaat-ud-Dawa, a purported charity that functions as a front for the banned Lashkar, too have been extended by 60 days  for the same reason.        
	We extended it because we have nothing against them to produce in court. Were acting on the UN resolution (blacklisting Saeed and Dawa). After 60 days, well review it, said Pervaiz Rasheed, spokesperson for the Punjab provincial government.        
	All six are detained under the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance, which allows the government to keep people in custody for up to 90 days.        
	Saeed was put under house arrest on December 11, 2008, so he will have spent 90 days in detention when the 60-day extension ends. He would then have to be freed if the government claims it still has no evidence of his involvement in terrorism.        
	The other five Dawa officials in custody are Col (retired) Nazir Ahmed, Amir Hamza, Yasin Baloch, Mufti Abdur Rahman and Qazi Niaz.        
	In the days after the Mumbai attacks, Pakistan had arrested two of the suspected planners, Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi and Zarar Shah, in a crackdown on Lashkar in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. Their status isnt clear.        
	The Wall Street Journal has said that Shah has confessed to his involvement in the attacks, and India says Lakhvi was the mastermind. Islamabad, which conceded last week that the lone surviving gunman  Mohammed Ajmal Kasab  was a Pakistani, says its investigations are still on.        
	Saeed had founded Lashkar, whom India blames for the Mumbai carnage, in 1990. It was banned in Pakistan under US pressure in 2002, prompting it to reinvent itself as Dawa. Saeed was put under house arrest after a UN Security Council committee added him and Dawa to a list of people and outfits linked to al Qaida or the Taliban.        
	Saeeds home in Lahore has been declared a sub-jail, but local media reports said he was being allowed to leave his home and that Dawas headquarters at Muridke near Lahore was still fully operational.        
	Fifty-five other Dawa activists have been put on a watch list. Rasheed said the Punjab government had sealed about 70 Dawa offices and taken over 30 of its schools and dispensaries.        
	Envoy at dinner        
	Indian high commissioner Satyabrata Pal attended a dinner hosted by Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari for envoys of non-Muslim countries in Islamabad last night. Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani too was present.

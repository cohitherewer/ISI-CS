The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | All rebels flee in fog after nine-day fight

	Srinagar, Jan. 9: A team of Pakistani militants has escaped through a cordon of 2,000 troops after a nine-day encounter, leaving the security forces to blame the weather for the humiliation in Jammu after the heroism of Mumbai.        
	The seven to 10 rebels killed two soldiers and one policeman but apparently lost none of their own although the army had earlier claimed killing four Jaish-e-Mohammed militants.        
	The siege of the Bhatidhar forests in Poonch was called off this afternoon after the army and police moved in following a three-day lull in firing and found the jungles and caves empty  of rebels or bodies.        
	The security forces, whose men had killed or arrested all the 10 Mumbai attackers, fighting them in the streets and buildings, were left hunting for excuses and pointed at the rugged terrain, fog and the thick bushes.        
	A brief army statement said the possibility of terrorists having slipped out taking advantage of the rugged terrain and prevailing climatic conditions cannot be ruled out.        
	You can only have an idea of what this terrain is if you personally visit it, Brigadier Gurdeep Singh told reporters. He added that despite the odds, the troops had destroyed three caves that the militants were using.        
	The army, which had thrown a three-tier cordon around an 8sqkm area in the forests, some 7km from the Line of Control, has repeatedly claimed that only 350 troops were involved in the operation. Sources, however, said the actual number was several times higher.        
	An army officer said the media should not read too much into the failure. Among hundreds of operations, you have one where you dont achieve your goal, he said.        
	Since December 31 evening, the handful of militants had engaged the forces in one of the longest counter-insurgency operations in the state, shooting dead a junior commissioned officer, a naik and a special police officer. Sources said the rebels were well stocked with food, weapons and ammunition.        
	The last firing took place on January 6 morning. That is probably when they managed to escape, a source said. The forces continued the siege for three more days.        
	For these nine days, the security forces had no idea how many militants they were fighting. Their claim of having killed four was based on intercepts of wireless communication between the trapped militants and their comrades.        
	There was no clash or exchange of fire with terrorists on January 8, confirmed Colonel D.K. Kachari, defence spokesman at the Northern Command headquarters in Udhampur.        
	Some officers suggested, hopefully, that the rebels might still be holed up in adjoining forests. The LoC is a long distance away and its unlikely they have crossed it. We have not given up hope and will get them, a police officer said.                    
	The security forces had suffered a major embarrassment in 1995 during the siege of the Charar-e-Sharif shrine, when top Pakistani militant Mast Gul broke the cordon and fled with his team. The forces, however, have had many successful operations against militants too.

   24 days to go 
                                      
	 Hyderabad: The Congresss plate of rice promises is overflowing.          
	The party has pledged 6kg of rice at Rs 2kg per person to a poor family, up from 4kg now, if voted to power. The promise, made in the Congress manifesto for the Assembly polls, will cost the state an extra Rs 4,000 crore.          
	Chief minister Y.S.R. Reddy, reading from the manifesto he has released, also said a loan of Rs 20,000 would be given to each beneficiary of the Indiramma housing scheme for the poor, in addition to existing subsidies.          
	Free power, the staple of many a poll promise, is there, too: farmers will get nine hours of free electricity, up from seven now. Reddy said the state could lose Rs 1,20,000 crore invested in welfare schemes that he claimed Opposition parties would leave unfinished if they came to power.                  
	 Lucknow: The kingdom is long lost, not the urge to rule.          
	Members of the erstwhile royal families have jumped into the heat-and-grime of polls, wooing voters in areas that were once their fiefs. One of them is Sanjay Singh, from the royal family of Amethis Ramnagar.           
	The Congress leader is a Lok Sabha candidate from Sultanpur. Sanjays wife Amita is an MLA from a seat in Amethi. Sanjay made his political debut, as an MLA first and then as an MP in 1998 on a BJP ticket. He returned to the Congress later. His father Raja Rananjay Singh became an MLA in the 1952 polls, the countrys first.

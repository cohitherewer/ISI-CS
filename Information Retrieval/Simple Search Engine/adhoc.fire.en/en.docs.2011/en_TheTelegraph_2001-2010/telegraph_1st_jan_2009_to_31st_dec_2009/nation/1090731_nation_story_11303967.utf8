                                                                                                               School meal pricing index
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 30: The human resource development ministry has proposed for the first time a mechanism that will automatically link money allocated for the midday meal scheme to fluctuating market prices of food items.         
	The ministry has suggested a special pricing index, which will vary with costs, for select food items used in the scheme.        
	The proposal, if accepted, will bind the Centre and states to increased funding if prices of these items rise, even if the overall inflation rate at the time is low.         
	The index, according to the ministry proposal, will cover five essential commodities  including lentils, vegetables and oil  school education officials said today.        
	The index is a one among a set of reforms the ministry is proposing in the scheme that is credited with assisting the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan in achieving near universal primary school enrolment.        
	We want to rationalise the funding of the midday meal scheme, HRD minister Kapil Sibal said this morning, addressing a conference of state school education secretaries in Vigyan Bhavan.        
	The proposed restructuring of funding norms for the midday meal scheme is as yet just a ministry suggestion which will need clearance from the finance ministry and ultimately from the cabinet.        
	But if the reforms are accepted, they will end the practice of the Centre and states fixing funding norms for the scheme based on broad inflation rates.        
	The proposal for a separate midday meal pricing index follows repeated complaints by state governments which found echo among ministry officials too.

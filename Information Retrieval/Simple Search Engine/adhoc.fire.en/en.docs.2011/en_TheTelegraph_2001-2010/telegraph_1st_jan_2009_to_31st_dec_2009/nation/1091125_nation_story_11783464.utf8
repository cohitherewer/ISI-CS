          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                           
	New Delhi, Nov. 24: The Liberhan Commission has held the Muslim leadership, too, partly responsible for the demolition of the Babri Masjid.         
	While the RSS, VHP, Shiv Sena, Bajrang Dal and the BJP brought the temple construction movement to the front burner and caused it to boil over, the fanatic Muslim leadership making the counter claims was either completely complacent and had no substantial or effective leadership or was simply incompetent, the commissions report stated.         
	It criticised the communitys leaders for their failure to protest effectively against the events which were building up to a crescendo.         
	The report indicted the Muslim leaders saying they were mere bystanders and put forth a dismal performance.         
	Singling out the Babri Masjid Action Committee, later the All India Babri Masjid Action Committee, it said: The Muslim leadership did little to counter the latent fears stoked up by the RSS and VHP leadership and instead provided it with the opportunity to embark on what started out as a defensive strategy.         
	According to the report: It is impossible to fight a war or to recruit warriors without the presence of an adversary. The Muslim leadership wittingly or unwittingly fulfilled this requirement for the founders of the RSS and the VHP.         
	The Muslim leadership was conspicuous by its absence and did little to counter the distortions of history that were being bandied about by the Sangh parivar, the report said.         
	The leaderships sins of omission made the Sangh parivars task easier, Justice Liberhan said in his conclusion, holding organisations and individuals guilty at a tertiary level for their failure to effectively champion the cause of their constituents, and of the neutrals, and for their failure as an effective democratic opposition.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Maya sacks 150 officials
                                                                                                               Maya sacks 150 officials
                            
	Lucknow, May 18: Mayavati today sacked over 150 political appointees to government posts, making good her threat that she would wield the axe if the BSP didnt get 50 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh.        
	The ruling BSP won only 21 seats, just two more than its 2004 tally.        
	The chief minister is also believed to have decided to remove several senior party leaders after a meeting on May 22.        
	The officials removed from their posts today were chairmen, vice-chairmen, office-bearers and board members of government-owned corporations. The BSP chief had entrusted these officials with the job of ensuring a resounding victory for the party.

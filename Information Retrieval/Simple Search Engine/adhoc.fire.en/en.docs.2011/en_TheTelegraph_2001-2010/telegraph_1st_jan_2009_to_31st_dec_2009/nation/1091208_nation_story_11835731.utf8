          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 7: A draft climate change accord proposed jointly by Brazil, China, India and South Africa is devoid of the deviation from Indias standard stance that surfaced in environment minister Jairam Rameshs Parliament statement last week.        
	The draft, representing views of developing countries and submitted to negotiators only days before the start of the UN climate change conference in Copenhagen today, has all key elements long articulated by India, climate policy analysts said.        
	The draft reaffirms that all climate change-related actions should conform with the principle of equity and enhanced long-term co-operative action to combat climate change should proceed under a paradigm of equity.        
	The equity principle is linked to Indias position that per capita emissions of the greenhouse gases  which are currently much higher in the industrialised countries than in the developing countries  should converge at some point in the future.        
	In his statement in Parliament last week, Ramesh indicated that India should be prepared to go beyond its per capita argument, pointing out that Indias advantage of a low per capita emerges only from its failure to control population.         
	The four-country draft is a firm and clear document, but the ministers statement has created uncertainty about Indias position in Copenhagen, said T. Jayaraman, a climate policy analyst.        
	The contrast between the draft and the statement in Parliament last week shouldnt really be surprising because it is easier to articulate a likely deviation domestically than with four partner developing countries, a climate campaigner in a non-government agency said. Well have to see what position India takes in the Copenhagen negotiations, said Kushal Yadav, a campaigner with the Centre for Science and Environment.         
	In Parliament today, Ramesh said India would not accept legally binding emission cuts. Wherever the world supports us in terms of finance and technology, they can come and verify what we are doing. But where you (the developed world) are not supporting us... we will not offer these actions to international scrutiny.              
	A senior policy analyst said the ministers earlier statements were in line with the idea that while India did not contribute to the problem of greenhouse gas emissions and global warming, it should be seen as willing to address the problem.

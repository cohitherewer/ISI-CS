The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Grant for Patel trusts
                                                                                                               Grant for Patel trusts
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 27: The Centre has sanctioned Rs 20 crore for the renovation of two memorials to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel in his home state Gujarat at a time a debate is raging on his legacy.        
	Sardar Patel Memorial Trust in Ahmedabad will get Rs 17 crore and the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Memorial in Anand Rs 3 crore. The grants have been made even as requests for similar funding by other trusts are pending.        
	It may be true the decision coincides with a controversy but our grant is a normal procedural one, a culture ministry official said. The Ahmedabad trust had sought Sonia Gandhis help last year.

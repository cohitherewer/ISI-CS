The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | DMK seals deal; hint of expansion delay
                                                                                                               DMK seals deal; hint of expansion delay
          OUR BUREAU                          Azhagiri                                  
	New Delhi/Chennai, May 25: The DMK today clinched a berth pact with the Congress, opting for three cabinet ministries and four minister-of-state posts in a deal that sent the star of M. Karunanidhis eldest son up a few notches.        
	M.K. Azhagiri will get one of the cabinet berths and also rise up the party pecking order as the DMK point man in Delhi, sources hinted.        
	The other cabinet posts are expected to go to Karunanidhis great-nephew Dayanidhi Maran and former minister A. Raja. Karunanidhis daughter Kanimozhi, a Rajya Sabha member, is apparently not keen on a ministers post any more since the Congress is reluctant to offer her independent charge, the sources said.        
	Karunanidhi issued a statement saying the Prime Minister had called him and agreed to induct all the DMK nominees. All issues with the Congress have been sorted out, he said.        
	The ministers are likely to be sworn in during the next cabinet expansion, which may be postponed from Tuesday possibly because of the Bengal storm and Punjab violence. A meeting Sonia Gandhi has scheduled with the Prime Minister tomorrow morning also fuelled speculation that the expansion could be delayed.        
	Azhagiri, who arrived in Delhi at noon, carried the list of names, signalling his new importance in the party. The position of point man in Delhi was earlier held by Maran and then T.R. Baalu, who appears to have been sacrificed to make room for Azhagiri in the cabinet.        
	Azhagiri has convinced his father he can do the job in spite of his inexperience of Delhi politics. The first-time MP from Madurai has decided to assert his authority from the start lest Maran, Kanimozhi or Baalu sneak into the picture, the sources said.        
	Its typical of Azhagiris brazen style, grabbing control of an emerging situation, a senior DMK leader said. Although he knows the Congress would prefer the more suave Maran as the go-between, he has let the Congress managers know that its him they will be dealing with.        
	 The sources said Congress intermediaries would need to cope with not only Azhagiris bluntness but also his poor command of English or Hindi.         
	Karunanidhi seems to have chosen Azhagiri for two reasons: he will take care of family interests and the new responsibility will mean less interference from him in the state administration.

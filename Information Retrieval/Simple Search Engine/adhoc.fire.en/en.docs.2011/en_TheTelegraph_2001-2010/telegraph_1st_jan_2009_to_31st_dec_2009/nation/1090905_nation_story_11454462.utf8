The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Congress gets Reddy with Jaipal   Delhi face frontrunner in name race
                                                                                                               Congress gets Reddy with Jaipal
   Delhi face frontrunner in name race
          SANJAY K. JHA                           Jaipal Reddy                                        
	New Delhi, Sept. 4: Ready, set, go. In Andhras political parlance, it can be modified to Reddy, set, go.         
	The Congress leadership is convinced that they need a Reddy to lead the party in Andhra Pradesh and Union minister S. Jaipal Reddy is emerging as the frontrunner.        
	Although Jaipal is not considered a mass leader and is dismissed by locals as an NRA (non-resident Andhra-ite), party sources here reveal that he would be the high commands first choice among the many Reddys in the race.         
	While one factor that could go against Jaipal is his restrictive mobility, his intimacy with the central leadership, long experience, political neutrality and media-savvy image bolster his case.         
	There is a realisation that he may not be the ideal Reddy to lead the party in elections but that is not a deterrent as the Congress has just been voted to power. The five-year period is long enough to groom a young leader, including Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddys son Jaganmohan, for the top job.         
	Sources say Sonia Gandhi would go out of her way to look after the YSR family in this hour of crisis but making his son the chief minister straightaway is almost impossible. The leadership does not want to send out a message that dynasty is a rule in the Congress. Even Rahul Gandhi has chosen to put his nose to the grindstone and earn his place in the party. Leaders say the possibility of Jaganmohan being inducted into Manmohan Singhs cabinet as a junior minister cannot be ruled out.         
	A stint in the central government will give him the right kind of opportunity to learn the intricacies of governance and grow in stature.         
	The party hopes the chorus among MLAs for him to be made the chief minister is only an emotional response, which can be managed with the passage of time. Sources say the high command will also not show any haste in removing K. Rosaiah who has already taken oath as chief minister.         
	Rosaiah will be replaced only if there is intense pressure from the Reddy lobby. The high command is aware that there is a solid bloc of around 40 Reddys among the 156 Congress MLAs who are bound to raise the question of a chief minister of their caste group sooner or later. Of the 14 chief ministers Andhra has had so far, nine were Reddys and all of them from the Congress.         
	Among the claimants in state politics are Diwakar Reddy and Geeta Reddy, both ministers in the YSR government, and K. Jana Reddy, a senior leader who is an MLA.         
	The sources say the YSR family may not like either of them to be given an opportunity to develop deeper roots in state politics.

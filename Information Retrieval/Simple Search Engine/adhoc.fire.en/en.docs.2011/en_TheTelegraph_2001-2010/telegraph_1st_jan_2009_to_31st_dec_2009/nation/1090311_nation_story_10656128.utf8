The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Yale to pick Pachauri brain
                                                                                                               Yale to pick Pachauri brain
          K.P. NAYAR                           Pachauri at the climate conference in Copenhagen on Tuesday. (AFP)                                  
	Washington, March 10: As the new Obama administration takes up climate change as one of its most difficult challenges, mainstream America is reaching out to India in an effort to provide intellectual leadership to US efforts to put behind eight years of denial of global warming under the previous Bush administration.        
	Yales president, Richard Levin, announced amid considerable excitement today that Rajendra K. Pachauri, who shared the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) with former US Vice-President Al Gore, will head the universitys newly established Yale Climate and Energy Institute (YCEI).        
	Pachauri will continue to chair the IPCC and retain his post as director-general of The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) in New Delhi as he takes up his part-time position at Yale.        
	He is an acknowledged leader in the global climate policy debate and played a major role in laying the groundwork for the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, which the Bush administration trashed.        
	We are fortunate to attract one of the worlds foremost climate-change experts to lead this ambitious new institute, Yales president said. No one has a more comprehensive grasp of the science and policy of climate change or has done more to bring attention to this urgent issue.        
	Because climate change does not have the profile of Afghanistan or Iraq on Americas policy radar, it is probably the most understated challenge for Obama after his Republican predecessor turned the clock back on the environment during his eight years in the White House.        
	Pachauri indirectly acknowledged this challenge when he said in Copenhagen, where he was attending the International Scientific Congress on Climate Change today, that climate change has now become an important part of government policy worldwide, and the Yale Climate and Energy Institute has enormous potential to fill the need for objective analysis of mitigation options.        
	Yale has been wooing the Indian environmentalist ever since he shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Gore. Pachauri, who taught a semester at Yales School of Forestry and Environmental Studies in 2000, was given an honorary degree last year by the university.        
	The new institute will provide seed grants, support postgraduate study, sponsor conferences and workshops, and foster interdisciplinary research spanning from basic atmospheric science to public policy, according to Yales spokeswoman, Suzanne Taylor Muzzin.        
	Nearly 100 Yale scientists, engineers, physicians, social scientists and policy experts have joined together to launch the institute.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Dip in loyal votes, rise in Delhi berths 
                                                                                                               Dip in loyal votes, rise in Delhi berths 
          AJAY SUKUMARAN                          Krishna: Double duty                                  
	Bangalore, May 24: A day before he was sworn in as cabinet minister, S.M. Krishna said Karnataka ought to have more representation at the Centre.         
	As if on cue, Krishna and his Congress colleague Veerappa Moily turned out the surprise entrants, that too from a state where the partys election results were its most dismal ever.        
	In giving Karnataka two cabinet ministers  the state hasnt had one since BJP leader Ananth Kumar in the NDA years  the Congress may have cast a wary eye on the falling vote share in what was once a party pocketborough that bailed out Indira Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi.        
	In 1978, defeated at Rae Bareli, Indira Gandhi made a comeback into national politics with a win in the coffee belt of Chikmagalur, while Sonia chose Bellary as a buffer in 1999 in case the going got rough in Amethi.         
	Both the seats are firmly in the BJPs control now.         
	Even while its losses kept mounting in Karnataka over the past five years, the one consolation the Congress had was that it still got more votes than the BJP.         
	Not anymore, since the BJP has increased its vote share all over the state.         
	While it gained only one seat over the 2004 tally, the BJP vote share in Karnataka jumped to 41.63 per cent from 36.83 per cent  an indication that it has spread its votes across the state unlike in the past when it held sway only in a few pockets.        
	The party won 19 of Karnatakas 28 seats  its best state tally in the country  and the win has put Karnataka just behind Gujarat, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, where the BJPs vote share is between 43 per cent and 46 per cent.         
	The Congress, which improved its vote share marginally to 37.65 per cent, and the Janata Dal (Secular), which had a tacit co-operation in many constituencies, won six and three Lok Sabha seats, respectively.        
	This time it has been a straight fight (between the BJP and the Congress), said BJPs Karnataka spokesperson C.T. Ravi. In 2004, it was a triangular fight.        
	The JD(S), led by former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, has lost vote share though it gained a seat. More significantly, it consolidated votes from the Vokkaliga community, the states second largest electoral block, which also used to back the Congress.         
	Owing to the consolidation of the Vokkaliga vote, the BJP made inroads into northeastern districts of Gulbarga, Raichur and Koppal, even winning the latter two for the first time.         
	Besides, it also won a considerable vote share in south Karnataka seats such as Chikkaballapur and Chamarajanagar, which it had not contested earlier. In those seats it was already strong in, the party won by huge margins.        
	Krishna, appointed external affairs minister yesterday, is the Congresss tallest Vokkaliga leader and he also enjoys goodwill in Bangalore, a city that has voted in the BJP in consecutive Assembly and Lok Sabha elections. By making him a cabinet minister, the Congress is also eyeing a chance at winning back Vokkaliga support.         
	Fellow Vokkaliga, actor M.H. Ambareesh, the minister of state for information and broadcasting in the previous UPA government, was among the Congressmen who lost.        
	Krishnas elevation, however, is seen with suspicion by many in the Congress, who question the wisdom of rewarding someone who led the party downhill in the state by focusing only on Bangalore.         
	As a balancing act, therefore, the Congress may also have to accommodate veteran Scheduled Caste leader Mallikarjuna Kharge, who resigned as Opposition leader in Karnatakas Assembly and won the Gulbarga Lok Sabha seat.         
	Political analyst Sandeep Shastri says the BJPs win reflects the disunity in the Congress and also the fact that its 11-month-old government is yet to face anti-incumbency. Voters have a tendency to be more indulgent to the ruling party during the first year, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Raju in B-school syllabus
                                                                                                               Raju in B-school syllabus
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                          Ramalinga Raju                                  
	Hyderabad, Jan. 28: Ramalinga Raju is in jail; you can also find him in textbooks.        
	The fallen Satyam chairman, cooling his heels behind bars since he admitted to a Rs 7,000-crore corporate fraud, is part of the curriculum for business school students.        
	The dean of the Hyderabad-based Indian School of Business (ISB), Ajit Rangnekar, announced yesterday that Raju was no longer on the institutes 30-member governing board but would be part of the curriculum as a case study for MBA students.        
	In other words, a case study to warn future business managers what could happen if they trod the same path.        
	This will be a strong case study. You find that there was family interest in diversification; the family had huge growth ambition. Then you find the companys promoters apparently have shown lack of governance principles, associate dean K. Ramachandran said.        
	ISB sources said the institute would next month host a conference on family-run businesses where one of the topics will be the role of independent directors.        
	Several former independent directors of Satyam  like Mangala Srinivasan, M. Rammohan Rao, who quit as dean of the ISB since the scandal broke, and T.R. Prasad  will be invited to address the conference.        
	Three months back, if somebody had said Ramalinga Raju is on your board, you would have said Oh, wonderful. But we were just innocent victims in the crossfire. It does feel bad that your name is unduly dragged in, dean Rangnekar said.        
	But there is something to cheer about amid the gloom.        
	The Hyderabad business school has been ranked No. 15 in the global B-school rankings released by the Financial Times, London.        
	It is the only Indian business school in the top 100 list.

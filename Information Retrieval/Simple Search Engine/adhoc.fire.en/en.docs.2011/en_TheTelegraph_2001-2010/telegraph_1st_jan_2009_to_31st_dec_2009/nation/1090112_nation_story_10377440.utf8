The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | An American bailout straw
                                                                                                               An American bailout straw
          K.P. NAYAR                              
	Washington, Jan. 11: If the government were to set aside considerations of national pride and allow Satyams new board to seek bailout money from the US treasury for the companys operations in America, the beleaguered information technology major may get some of the liquidity support it is seeking to stay afloat.        
	In Americas blogosphere, speculation is already rife about the possibility of the local arm of Satyam Computer Services seeking a bailout with US taxpayer money sanctioned last year to keep businesses in this country going.        
	Satyam has 53,000 employees in the US, many of them in Californias Silicon Valley which relies, in part, for its prosperity on being an investor, partner and promoter in Indias high tech information technology sector.        
	Satyams offices dot much of North America, from Parsippany in New Jersey to Santa Clara in California in the US and from Toronto to Calgary in Canada.        
	Although the majority of these 53,000 workers in the US are on H1-B visas and are not American citizens, their employment here has a spin-off on the economies of small towns in this country, where they spend money renting houses, buying cars and on other needs of daily life.        
	On a Reuters blog, Dealzone about deals and deal-making, Chris Kaufman wrote: Unsurprisingly, scandal-slammed Indian outsourcing firm Satyam says it may need some liquidity support to stay alive. But this little liquidity support bombshell could prove to be a tricky one if it is directed at the biggest bail-out office currently handing out cash: the US Treasury.        
	In principle, the US treasurys Capital Purchase Programme prohibits enterprises controlled by a foreign bank or company from taking advantage of the bailout announced after a crisis gripped the American economy in October last year.        
	But the administration of the bailout has been so complex and the secrecy behind the programme so pervasive that foreign banks, including one famously in South Korea, are said to have benefited from it.        
	Banks in the US have refused to reveal how they spent the bailout money and treasury secretary Hank Paulson and his department have declined to respond to Freedom of Information Act requests in this regard.        
	Last month, Rupert Murdochs television company Fox Business Network filed a lawsuit against the treasury department over failure to provide information on the bailout funds. So Satyam has some hope!        
	One blogger wrote that Satyam probably doesnt have the chutzpah to seek TARP (Troubled Assets Relief Program) funds directly. The companys primary function as an outsourcing centre would make the use of US bailout funds politically repugnant to US officials.        
	That is probably true. Incoming vice president Joe Biden has created a new post of chief economist and economic policy advisor in his office and nominated Jared Bernstein for this post.        
	Bernstein is a board member of United Professionals, an organisation that was specifically created to protect and preserve the American middle class, now under attack from so many directions, from downsizing and outsourcing.        
	Because Satyam has thrived on the outsourcing of American jobs, Bernstein can be expected to strain every muscle to prevent anything that will help an Indian business process outsourcing firm to survive.

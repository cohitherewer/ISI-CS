          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Azam, Jaya                          
	Lucknow, May 17: Rebel Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan today quit as general secretary and parliamentary board member, citing the party leaders closeness to communal forces.        
	The resignation of Khan, who is believed to have alienated Muslim voters from the party by criticising Mulayam Singh Yadavs friendship with Kalyan Singh, came a day after Jaya Pradas victory from Rampur. Khan had openly campaigned against the actress.         
	Jaya Prada conveyed to Khan her gratitude for helping her win in an apparent jibe prompted by his failed attempts to queer her poll pitch.        
	Khan did not name Mulayam while speaking of his resignation today but blamed the decline in the partys Lok Sabha seats from 35 in 2004 to 23 on the ties with Kalyan.        
	The Samajwadi leaders closeness to communal forces has prompted me to take the step (to reign). However, I will continue to work like any ordinary worker, Khan, among the partys earliest general secretaries, said.        
	Amar Singh, who had twice threatened to walk out of the party over his differences with Khan, today said Khans main fault was airing views in public but was ready to forgive him.

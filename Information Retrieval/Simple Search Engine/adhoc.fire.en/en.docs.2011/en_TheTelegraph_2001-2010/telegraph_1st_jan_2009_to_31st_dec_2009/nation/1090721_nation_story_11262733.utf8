                                                                                                               Confession under duress, alleges Pak
          NASIR JAFFRY                              
	Islamabad, July 20: Senior Pakistani officials and lawyers today refused to attach much importance to Ajmal Kasabs confession in a Mumbai court, saying it may have come under duress.        
	They, however, acknowledged that Delhi might now increase the pressure on Islamabad to extradite the five accused it is poised to try in Pakistan.        
	Kasab, the lone survivor among the ten 26/11 gunmen, today confessed his role in court in a stunning about-turn after having previously pleaded not guilty.        
	A senior security official here questioned the trials transparency. Kasab had originally pleaded not guilty; how do we know he did not give this statement (confession) under duress? he asked.        
	Shahbaz Rajput, counsel for one of the five accused to be tried in Pakistan, echoed him.        
	A confession obtained from a suspect in detention has no importance or value, he said. I am sure that Kasab changed his statement under duress, because he is in the custody of the Indian government.        
	The security official, who didnt want to be named, demanded that Pakistani investigators be allowed to question Kasab and the two detained Indians in the case: Fahim Ansari and Sabauddin Ahmad.        
	He said it was difficult to ascertain the truth since all the police officers  including slain anti-terrorist squad chief Hemant Karkare  who might have been in a position to help the Indian prosecution were dead.        
	The official described Kasabs confession as part of an effort by India to build pressure on Pakistan.        
	The entire process has all along been one-sided, he said. Certainly there will be renewed pressure on Pakistan in the light of the new statement Kasab has given.        
	New Delhi wants Islamabad to hand over the five accused whose pre-trial proceedings started on Saturday in a Pakistani anti-terrorist court. So far, Pakistan has refused, saying that since the men are accused of hatching the conspiracy on its soil, they should be tried under Pakistani law.        
	The accused include Lashkar-e-Toiba operative Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, the alleged mastermind.                                
	, and four facilitators: Hammad Amin Sadiq, Mazhar Iqbal, Abdul Wajid alias Zarar Shah and Shahid Jamil.        
	 We have been asking India to give us concrete proof about the involvement of all these people, but how can we trust such statements, especially when we do not have any access to Kasab and the others? another senior official said.        
	He said the trial of the five accused in Pakistan had already begun and we would like the Indian authorities to co-operate with us.        
	Pakistani investigations have revealed that Sadiq facilitated the funds and hideouts for the Mumbai attack while Iqbal was the gunmens handler. Wajid was the computer expert and Shahid Jamil had trained the crew of the Al-Hussaini and Al-Fouz, which took the gunmen from Karachi into the Indian waters near Mumbai.

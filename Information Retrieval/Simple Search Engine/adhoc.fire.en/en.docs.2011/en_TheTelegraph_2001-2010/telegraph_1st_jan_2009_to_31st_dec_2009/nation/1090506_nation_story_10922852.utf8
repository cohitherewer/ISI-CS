The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Noidas not Nandi: its game for a good deal
                                                                                                               Noidas not Nandi: its game for a good deal
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN IN NOIDA                          Price puzzle: A farmer harvests wheat near highrises in Noida                                  
	Land is a major election issue in this village in Gautam Buddh Nagar (Noida), as in much of western Uttar Pradesh. Whats more, the area had witnessed police firing on farmers agitating to get back their acquired land three years ago.        
	But thats where the similarities with Nandigram end. As far as farmer sentiments are concerned, Nandigram and Dhum Manikpur are farther apart than the 1,500km that separate them. Farmers here want to sell their land, or at least a part of it. They just want the price to be right.        
	Which is why the Bahujan Samaj Partys Surendra Nagar is the favourite to win from the Gautam Buddh Nagar constituency. After all, Mayavati has doubled the acquisition rate to Rs 3.5 lakh per bigha, which comes to around Rs 324 per square yard.        
	Unlike the people of Nandigram and Singur, we are not sentimental about land, said Subhash Chandra Rawal, a farmer-cum-teacher. I cant live off the land because our holdings have shrunk over the years. While agricultural expenses have risen, the returns have become smaller.        
	Unlike Nandigram, Dhum Manikpur shows no overt sign of poverty or restiveness. All the 3,000-odd houses are made of cement and bricks. Many are two-storied, painted and connected with a mortared road, and boast electricity and hand pumps.         
	That is no surprise since Gautam Buddh Nagar has been Uttar Pradeshs showpiece of economic development. Agricultural land has been taken over here ostensibly for community use without much resistance  except for one in July 2006, whose epicentre lay in Bajhera Khurd, 20km from Dhum Manikpur.        
	But even that violent agitation  which led to the police firing  had resulted from farmers demand for better compensation, not from a refusal to give up land. The farmers had felt cheated when land prices rose to Rs 500 a square yard after the Mulayam Singh Yadav government had acquired their plots at Rs 150 a square yard for Anil Ambanis Dadri power project.        
	Today, farmers Pawan Rawal and Manveer Bhatti look back on the protests with regret. Manveer, 30, a Gujjar farmer-cum-property dealer from Dadri, said he had then backed the protesters silently. But the clashes and the firing stalled the project, wrecking the farmers dream of cashing in on Reliances arrival in the area.        
	So, when Nandigram erupted against the Bengal governments plans to acquire land for a chemical hub, Pawan, 35, was among those here who closely followed the developments. The Hindi newspapers were not lacking in detail; TV too played up the agitation, the part-farmer, part-businessman said.        
	Later, when the Tatas moved out of Singur, Pawan wondered why Bengals farmers could not take a more balanced view of the issue.        
	There are so many models of land acquisition and economic development. There is no perfect one. We have to evolve one that has elements of each model and is acceptable to the government, the buyer and the seller, Pawan said.        
	Manveer said: Farmers should be free to sell their land and the government should not forcibly acquire it. Like in Haryana, let the government be a facilitator and mediate between the buyer and seller.        
	BJP president Rajnath Singh too has been talking on the land issue in his constituency of Ghaziabad, which neighbours Gautam Buddh Nagar. He has been backing the Haryana model.        
	Local farmers, however, prefer the Narendra Modi model. Former owners of farmland that the Gujarat government bought along national highways have been turned into stakeholders in the road and other infrastructure projects by private companies. For instance, Gujarat has made it mandatory for the companies to share a percentage of the toll tax earnings with the farmers.              
	 Gautam Buddh Nagar and Nandigram vote on May 7

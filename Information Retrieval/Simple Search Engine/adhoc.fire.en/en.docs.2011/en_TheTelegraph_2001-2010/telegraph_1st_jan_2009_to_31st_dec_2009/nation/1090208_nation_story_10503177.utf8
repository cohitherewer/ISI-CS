	Mumbai, Feb. 7: A 19-year-old stepped off a train and fired at police early this morning at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, bringing back chilly memories of 26/11.        
	Tea seller Raju Tomar, who was carrying a country-made revolver and failed to hit anyone, was chased, caught and arrested. Till evening, however, he had failed to give the police a coherent explanation of his conduct.        
	Tomar, who lives in the Ambedkar Nagar slums of Dadar, had got off the last train reaching the terminus at 1.45am. Two Government Railway Police (GRP) men posted at the station  where two gunmen had massacred 58 people on November 26 night  thought he looked suspicious and asked him to stop.        
	The youth allegedly pulled out a country-made katta revolver, threatened the constables and tried to run away.        
	When the policemen chased him, he fired one round at them. He has been caught and we have seized a katta and two live rounds from him, GRP commissioner A.K. Sharma said.        
	Sharma added that Tomar came from Madhya Pradesh and was a tea vendor.        
	When we asked him why he was carrying a revolver, his answers were not coherent, assistant commissioner Bapu Thombre said.        
	First, he claimed he planned to avenge his fathers death. Then he claimed he wanted to resolve a love tangle and thats why he had bought the gun.

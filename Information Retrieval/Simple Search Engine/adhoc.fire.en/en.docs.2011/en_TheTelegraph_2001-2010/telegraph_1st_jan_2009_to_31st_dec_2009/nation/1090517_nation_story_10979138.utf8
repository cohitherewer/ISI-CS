The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Identity politics takes a blow, focus on poor gets a thumbs-up 
                                                                                                               Identity politics takes a blow, focus on poor gets a thumbs-up 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                     
	New Delhi, May 16: The Election 2009 results may have provided a glimpse of what could become the new recipe for regional success in areas where identity politics has traditionally been the winning formula.         
	Be it Orissa or Bihar, Tamil Nadu or Andhra Pradesh, it is perceived development with a special focus on underprivileged sections that paves the route to electoral victory, todays results indicate.         
	Identity politics  based on caste or region  can be sprinkled as topping at best, but cant satisfy the voters appetite as the meal itself.         
	Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, from a party restricted largely to that state, raised specific demands for Bihar only after the last vote in the Lok Sabha election was cast.         
	Yet, his party, the Janata Dal (United), won handsomely, trouncing both rival Lalu Prasads Rashtriya Janata Dal and an elsewhere resurgent Congress to tally 20 seats.         
	In contrast, Mayavati was tipped as a potential prime ministerial candidate through the elections. But the Bahujan Samaj Party chief, who rode a Dalit-Brahmin caste combination wave in her favour to become Uttar Pradesh chief minister two years ago, could not win the expected number of seats.         
	The Telangana Rashtra Samiti, which has shuttled between the UPA, the third front and recently the NDA, battled electorally on a single plank all its life  regional identity. It has been whipped, winning only two seats.         
	Nitishs government has been credited with clamping down on crime in a state where kidnapping had risen to alarming levels. From 411 in 2004, the number of kidnappings came down to 55 in 2008.         
	Major highways were repaired and education for girls was an area of special focus for Nitish.         
	His government has indulged in social engineering  a euphemism for building or fortifying a formidable caste or community-based alliance  but by encouraging development.         
	In contrast, attempts by Lalu Prasad to corner Nitish over attacks on Biharis in Assam and Maharashtra appear to have failed.         
	As Orissa chief minister, Naveen Patnaik is credited with introducing landmark schemes for the poor, the rural population and women and children.         
	Today, voters rewarded his government with a third term and his party, the Biju Janata Dal, won 14 of the states 21 Lok Sabha seats.         
	Tamil Nadu chief minister M. Karunanidhi went on a fast to protest the attack on Tamils in Sri Lanka and read out poetry hailing a slain leader of the LTTE accused of assassinating former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.         
	But according to his party leaders, it was the freebies showered by the DMK government that helped the party, in coalition with the Congress, to emerge ahead of the ADMK grouping today.         
	Former Union minister Dayanidhi Maran argued that the Oppositions focus on Sri Lanka rather than on the governments performance helped the DMK.         
	In Andhra, the ability of the Congress to deliver on its promises appears to have worked in its favour, limiting the TRS even in Telangana and stymying expected numerical growth for the TDP.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 25: Laughter rang across the Kalinga Stadium as 600 boys and girls today participated in the three-day national sports and cultural meet being held by the National Child Labour Project (NCLP) scheme.         
	The event that started today saw the participation of children rescued from a life of labour and who were later brought in to the folds of education.         
	I am excited as I will be participating in the high jump and sprint events, said Sanju, 13. A former child labourer, the Khurda teenager is now a student in one of the six child labour schools in the district. These schools are run by NCLP and were launched in districts with high incidents of child labour.        
	In Orissa, similar schools have been started in Angul, Bargarh, Bolangir, Deogarh, Gajapati, Ganjam, Jharsuguda, Kalahandi, Koraput, Khurda, Malkangiri, Mayurbhanj, Nabarangpur, Nuapada, Rayagada, Sambalpur, Sonepur, Cuttack and Balasore.        
	Sanju who worked in a crusher unit with her parents recalled that she would wear a sari to look older. I earned Rs 50 per day that I gave to my mother who was also a labourer at the unit. My father was an alcoholic and I had to chip in to feed my three sisters, who were too young to work, she said.         
	Kodanda Pani Baral who spotted Sanju had a tough time convincing her mother to get her enrolled into a school. But now she attends school regularly, said Baral.         
	The special schools provided formal and non-formal education to children along with vocational training, a stipend of Rs 100 per month, supplementary nutrition and regular health check ups.         
	The event will continue till February 26 with athletics and cultural events, said Khurda district sports officer Krishna Panda.         
	This is an opportunity for the kids to enjoy and show us their talent, he added.

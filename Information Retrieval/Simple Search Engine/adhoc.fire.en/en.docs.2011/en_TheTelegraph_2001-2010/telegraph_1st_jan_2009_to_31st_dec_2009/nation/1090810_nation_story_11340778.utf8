          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, Aug. 9: A mishap was averted due to an early detection of a tiny crack on the grand chord (down) section of the Eastern Railway today.        
	The fissure formed near the western cabin of Gaya railway station was detected by a gangman who immediately alerted his superiors.        
	The NagpurGaya Deekscha Bhumi Express scheduled to pass through the zone was immediately brought to a halt near Kastha railway station.         
	Confirming the news, railway area manager S. Bhattacharya claimed that repair work was undertaken to minimise inconvenience caused to passengers and to facilitate train movement in the section, said to be the life-line of the countrys economy.         
	Railway officials said that the no specific reason could be attributed to the formation of the tiny fissure.         
	A railway team would be looking into the matter.        
	Meanwhile, Lalji Prasad, the general secretary of the Grand Chord Passengers Association, expressed concern over the lack of maintenance of tracks and excessive wear and tear.        
	He added that the tracks bear an excessive load, much beyond their capacity in this section.        
	On Saturday, a similar fissure was found on the tracks between Gaya and Dhanbad sections between the Bandhua and the Tenjuppa railway stations.

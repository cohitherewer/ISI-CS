The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Impeach panel judge opts out
                                                                                                               Impeach panel judge opts out
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                          Sen: Further delay                                  
	New Delhi, June 19: Supreme Court judge D.K. Jain, heading a panel to probe the grounds for the removal of Calcutta High Court Justice Soumitra Sen, has opted out.        
	Jain, appointed by the chairperson of the Rajya Sabha where Sens impeachment is pending, has apparently conveyed his refusal to head the panel, which includes T.S. Thakur, the chief justice of Punjab and Haryana High Court, and advocate Fali S. Nariman. Jain could not be contacted.         
	Jains decision has virtually delayed Sens impeachment. Sources said the law ministry had decided to speed up the process and urged Rajya Sabha chairperson Hamid Ansari to deal with the matter urgently.         
	With the panel now headless, Ansari will have to look for another judge willing to head the peers panel, as it is called. That will be a long process as it involves finding out if any judge is willing and appointing him afresh.        
	The Rajya Sabha chairperson is empowered under Section 2(3) of the Judges Inquiry Act, 1968, to appoint such a panel once the House admits a motion of impeachment.        
	The Chief Justice of India had recommended that Parliament impeach Sen after a three-member in-house committee found him guilty of misconduct.        
	But former law minister H.R. Bhardwaj had dismissed that inquiry, saying it had no relevance to the impeachment proceedings.        
	Even when such a motion is admitted in either House, a committee, consisting of a retired judge, a sitting judge and a jurist, will look into the charges again, he had said. It is not a judges power. It is Parliaments power.        
	The motion to impeach Sen was introduced by 57 members in the Rajya Sabha on February 20 this year.

                                                                                                               Absentee jawans sacked in Raipur
          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, Aug. 26: Services of 13 policemen were terminated for refusing to fight Maoists in Rajnandgaon district.        
	The jawans were among the 40 policemen who were recently transferred to Madanwada police post in the district. Of them, 15 jawans, who were specially trained for guerrilla and jungle warfare, did not turn up for duty.        
	Madanwada had hit the headlines when Maoist ambush killed 36 policemen, including Rajnandgaon superintendent of police Vinod Kumar Choubey on July 12. After the incident, the 40 policemen were transferred to Madanwada post on rotation basis from the district headquarters.        
	The newly appointed superintendent of police, Praveer Das, placed all the 15 jawans under suspension after the policemen failed to report on duty. Das also recommended the termination of all the jawans from the service for the laxity shown in discharging their duties.         
	The state government approved the proposal and the 13 jawans were today dismissed from service, police spokesperson and inspector-general (headquarters) R.K. Vij said.         
	The termination notice on two jawans could not be served as they were reported to be out of district headquarters, he added.         
	Sources said that the dismissed jawans, who refused to combat the guerrillas, were planning to fight the state government in the court of law.         
	Since the government took the decision without seeking an explanation from the jawans, the latter have decided to move court to challenge their dismissal, sources added.

	Srinagar, Aug. 17: Top intelligence officials in Jammu and Kashmir today said a large number of militants were waiting to sneak in across the border even as warnings of a disturbing surge echoed far away from the troubled Valley.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told chief ministers at a meeting in the national capital that the levels of infiltration that had come down very substantially had seen a surge this year.        
	The infiltrators are more battle-hardened, better equipped and in possession of sophisticated communication systems, he said at the chief ministers conference on internal security in Delhi.        
	In Kashmir, top intelligence sources said hundreds of militants had gathered at 42 training camps across the Line of Control and were waiting to cross over.         
	We fear escalation of violence during Ramazan, which is just days away, said an official.        
	The United Jihad Council (UJC), an umbrella body of 13 militant outfits based in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, has already ruled out a unilateral cease-fire in Jammu and Kashmir during the Muslim holy month.        
	If the Government of India takes a positive step in this direction, the UJC will sit and think over it, UJC chairman and Hizb-ul Mujahideen supreme commander Syed Salahuddin told a local news agency on Saturday.        
	The infiltration alerts, from Delhi and Kashmir, have come at a time the LoC has seen a spurt in militant activity. Sources said there had been at least 13 infiltration bids in the Kashmir valley alone that left dozens of militants and several jawans dead.        
	The Border Security Force on Saturday foiled a major attempt when a group of militants tried to cross a river flowing close to the international border in Jammus Samba sector.        
	Defence spokesman Lt Colonel J.S. Brar said the security forces had strengthened the counter-infiltration mechanism on the LoC that had suffered damage during the winter because of snowfall.        
	That is why most of the militants are being gunned down near the LoC and they do not succeed in crossing into the hinterland, he said.        
	But sources said many militants had already entered the Valley.         
	Around 195 militants have managed to infiltrate into the Valley in the past seven months against the 84 in the corresponding period last year. Some of them have been killed or arrested but most are active, an official said.        
	He said 370 militants were active in Kashmir and that more than 40 per cent of them were foreigners. This is in addition to 70 unlisted militants (unidentified but accounted for), he added.        
	Although militant violence has come down substantially over the years, officials said a year of unrest that began with the Amarnath land row had helped the rebels, who were now back in a position to carry out attacks with ease.        
	Our counter-insurgency grid has been disturbed as our focus has been to quell street protests. In the process, the militants have regrouped and consolidated their position, an official said.

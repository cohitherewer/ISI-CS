The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Maoist torture cry
                                                                                                               Maoist torture cry
  - Lawyer claims rebel detained illegally        ANANYA SENGUPTA                                    
	New Delhi, Sept. 25: Suspected Maoist leader Khobad Ghandy was tortured for three days and three nights before being officially arrested and produced before a magistrate, his lawyer claimed today.        
	Rajesh Tyagi said Intelligence Bureau (IB) officials picked his client up on September 17 and detained him illegally for four days before handing him over to the polices special cell on September 21.        
	IB officials allegedly refused to let Ghandy, 58, sleep even when he pleaded he had a cardiac problem. The day he was handed over to the police, his hands were tied to a table and he was asked to sleep in that position, Tyagi alleged.        
	The lawyer also claimed that Ghandy had been denied the basic right of every prisoner to know what he had been charged with.        
	A source who had met Ghandy in Tihar jail had earlier said the alleged CPI (Maoist) politburo member had been taken into custody on September 13.         
	Ghandy, who has prostate cancer and heart disease, has been in solitary confinement in Tihars high-risk ward since a magistrate remanded him in judicial custody till October 6.        
	Tyagi told The Telegraph he could not start legal proceedings on Ghandys behalf because neither he nor his client had received a copy of the first information report (FIR).        
	Apart from the FIR, there is no document to show what charges he has been booked under. Without it, I can neither move for bail nor prepare for the case, Tyagi said.        
	He accused Union home minister P. Chidambaram of playing with words. He (Chidambaram) said that He (Ghandy) is a Maoist leader; so he has been arrested. But is being a Maoist a crime? I think the FIR was made in haste after Ghandy was handed over to the special cell and there is nothing in it to implicate him, Tyagi said.        
	When we asked the police for a copy of the FIR, they said it had been sealed but did not explain who had sealed it. Even the courts have no right to seal an FIR, which is a public document.        
	Tyagi plans to approach Delhi High Court to get a copy of the FIR. The police say Ghandy had come to Delhi to spread Maoist propaganda.        
	The lawyer claimed Ghandy was picked up outside Sitaram Bhartia Hospital, where he had come for treatment, by six IB men and bundled into a Sumo before being driven to a safe house on Delhis outskirts.        
	Today, the Committee for the Release of Political Prisoners demanded that Ghandy be provided immediate medical treatment and the status of a political prisoner, with the attendant benefits such as material to read and write.

	Bangalore, Aug. 27: A Wipro Technologies employee who was serving out his notice period fell to his death from a building on the software giants campus at Electronics City here yesterday.        
	Vishal Yadav, 28, a native of Gwalior, was a business analyst.         
	Although police suspect Vishal may have committed suicide, they said they had not found any note or come across information that could explain the reason.        
	Vishal had gone on leave two months ago, and during that time, he had sent his resignation through email, said B.N.S. Reddy, Bangalores deputy commissioner of police (south-east). The resignation had been accepted and he was to work till August 31.        
	Around 10.40pm yesterday, a security guard at Electronics City, alerted by a thud, found Vishal lying at the foot of a 12-storey building. He was declared brought dead in hospital.

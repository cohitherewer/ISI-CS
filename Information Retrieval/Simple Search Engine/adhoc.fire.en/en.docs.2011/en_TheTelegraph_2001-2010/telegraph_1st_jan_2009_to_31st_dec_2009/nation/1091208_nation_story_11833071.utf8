          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 7: Social activist Medha Patkar has approached Governor M.C. Bhandare, apprehending fake encounter of the Chasi Mulia Adivasi Sangh leader Nachika Linga even as police recommended that the government ban the organisation for its alleged Maoist links and violent activities.        
	A delegation of social activists led by Patkar approached the governor with a memorandum containing a list of demands in support of the organisation. The team included Prafulla Samantra of the Lokshakti Abhiyan, Bhala Chandra Sarangi of CPI-ML (New Democracy) and Lingaraj Pradhan of the Paschima Orissa Krushak Sangham among others.        
	We fear a fake police encounter to eliminate Linga like Wadekia Singana, said Patkar, demanding a Tribal Advisory Committee meeting be convened immediately to discuss the issues.        
	Two tribals, including Chasi Mulia Adivasi Sangh leader Wadekia Singana, were killed and seven others injured in police firing during a violent demonstration near Narayanpatna police station in Koraput on November 20.        
	Demanding a judicial inquiry by a sitting Orissa High Court judge into the killing of Singana and land-grabbing issue, the activists rued that in the name of combing operations, the police were targeting tribals and supporting the land-grabbers.        
	The delegation urged the governor to intervene to ensure that the Salwa Judum-type operation in Narayanpatna of Koraput is dismantled. They also demanded murder and torture cases to be filed against the erring police officers besides a compensation of Rs 10 lakh to the next of the kin.        
	The tribals have brought under their control 2,500 acres from land-grabbers but with police action, they could not harvest their crops, she rued. The activists demanded that harvesting rights must remain with the 30,000 tribals or else they would face starvation and their food rights would be in jeopardy.

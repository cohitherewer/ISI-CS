          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sachin Tendulkar walks back after losing his wicket on the first day of the first Test against Sri Lanka in Ahmedabad. (AFP)                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 16: The tussle for Marathi legacy between uncle and nephew of the rival Senas today trapped Sachin Tendulkar on the pitch of politics with Bal Thackeray admonishing the cricket icon for saying Mumbai was for all Indians.        
	The Shiv Sena chief, an ardent fan of cricket and Tendulkar, lashed out at the master batsman in an open letter on the front page of party mouthpiece Saamna.        
	While you were speaking about your pride in being a Maharashtrian, why did you take this cheeky single? (By making these remarks) you have got yourself run out on the pitch of Marathi pride. What we dont understand is that why Maharashtrians dont understand this? says the letter, signed by Thackeray and titled Sachin, you manage your international pitch.        
	The verbal lashing was in response to a remark made by Tendulkar to mark 20 years in international cricket.        
	Mumbai belongs to India. That is how I look at it. I am a Maharashtrian and I am extremely proud of that but I am an Indian first, Tendulkar had said in an interview.        
	Thackerays uncharacteristic jibe at a player he admittedly admires and who has throughout his career steered clear of controversies is being seen as a desperate attempt to cling on to the Senas fast eroding Marathi support base.         
	Nephew Raj Thackerays Maharashtra Navnirman Sena has been trying to hold aloft the torch of Marathi pride, which had fetched the Shiv Sena dividends earlier.         
	The MNS, which won 13 Assembly seats last month, hit the headlines recently when its legislators attacked Samajwadi Party MLA Abu Azmi inside the House because he took his oath in Hindi, not Marathi, as Raj had dictated.         
	The senior Thackeray lectured Tendulkar on the blood and sweat that went into the carving out of Maharashtra in 1960 and the inclusion of Mumbai and followed it up with a loving warning.         
	Remember that when you hit fours and sixes, people praise you, but if you hit Marathi manoos where it hurts he will not tolerate it. Thats why please dont lose on the political pitch what you have earned on the cricket pitch is my loving warning to you for your own good, Thackeray signed off.        
	Mumbais people appear to be on the side of their hero.         
	 First Balasaheb criticised Marathi people for not voting for Shiv Sena. Now he is criticising someone who is not just a Maharashtrian icon, but a national and international one. I think this just shows the Shiv Senas desperation in trying to outdo the MNS, said Chintan Chapalgaonkar of Shivaji Park, a Sena bastion and where a young Sachin used to practice his shots.        
	The Congress admonished the Sena chief, saying Thackerays write-up deserves little better than the dustbin.         
	BCCI sprang to Sachins side, comparing Thackeray with Jinnah. This is the same language that Mohammed Ali Jinnah spoke. The whole of India and all Maharashtrians, excluding a few Shiv Sena leaders and leaders of Raj Thackerays party, are with Tendulkar, its spokesperson Rajiv Shukla said in Delhi.        
	Bhojpuri star attack        
	A mob attacked the home of Bhojpuri singer-actor Manoj Tiwari in suburban Mumbai tonight.         
	His spokesperson Shashikant Singh said the group came to the Four Bangalows area and said they wanted to meet Tiwari.         
	They started throwing stones and demanded that the actor return to his native place, Singh said.         
	The people in the mob also claimed Tiwari had spoken against Bal Thackerays criticism of Sachin Tendulkar. Singh said Tiwari has denied reacting on the Thackeray-Tendulkar issue.         
	A complaint has been lodged with Versova police.

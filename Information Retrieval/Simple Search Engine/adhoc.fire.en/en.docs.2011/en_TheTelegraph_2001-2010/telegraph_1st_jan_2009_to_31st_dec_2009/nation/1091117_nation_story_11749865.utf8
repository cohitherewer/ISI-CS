          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 16: The human resource development ministry is racing against time to introduce three key education reform bills in the coming session of Parliament, a challenge set to test lawyer-by-training minister Kapil Sibals persuasion skills.         
	The HRD ministry is seeking cabinet approval to table proposed laws to punish educational malpractice, set up tribunals to settle education disputes and establish a new higher education accreditation regime.         
	The three proposed laws can be tabled any time during the winter session from November 19 to December 22.         
	But a prime ministerial trip abroad starting November 24 coupled with concerns from the PMO over the sequencing of proposed reforms have transformed the exercise into a test for Sibal.         
	And the ministers test may come as soon as next Monday when the cabinet meets before Manmohan Singhs visit to the US, sources said.         
	The HRD ministry is desperately seeking approval for at least two of the bills  the Prohibition of Unfair Practices Bill and the Education Tribunals Bill  at the meeting on November 23.         
	Bills can be tabled in Parliament only after they are cleared by the cabinet, and success for the ministry before Singhs trip will enable their introduction in the House. The cabinet can be approached for the third bill  the National Authority for Regulation of Accreditation in Higher Education Bill  once Singh returns.         
	The PMO, however, has argued that a proposed law to set up an overarching higher education regulator, the National Commission for Higher Education and Research (NCHER), should be enacted before other proposed reforms as the watchdog should be involved in policy formulation on other reforms.         
	But the HRD ministry has decided to proceed with seeking cabinet approval for the three other bills first because these are independent of the NCHER.

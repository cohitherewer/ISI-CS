The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Minimum alms: A rupee and nothing less
                                                                                                               Minimum alms: A rupee and nothing less
          G.C. SHEKHAR                          FIXING WAGES?                                  
	Chennai, July 8: In Tamil Nadu, beggars can be choosers.        
	So if you are in the mood to give, it had better be at least Re 1. Nothing less will do.        
	The minimum wage was fixed at a recent meeting in the northern district of Erode, where the local beggars association decided not to accept useless 50- and 25-paise coins.        
	When we give these coins in tea-stalls or shops, the shopkeepers refuse to accept them saying they are of no value in the current times. So we appeal to the public to give us nothing less than Re 1, said N. Periasamy, the convener of the Erode District Beggars Association.        
	The association also wanted the state government to give old-age pension to those who cant beg any more and allot land for beggars to build small housing colonies.        
	While the public might react positively to the appeal  if only to avoid the embarrassment of seeing the alms tossed back with disdain  the state government cant really heed the other demands as begging is an offence under the 1945 Tamil Nadu Prevention of Begging Act.        
	Under this law, beggars picked up by police and convicted by judicial magistrates are taken to government-run care camps and an attempt is made to rehabilitate them. But most beggars escape from these centres and return to their roadside trade.        
	Last week, Chennai police rounded up nearly a hundred beggars who were regulars at traffic signals. The beggars would bang on windows of cars and prod two-wheeler riders if they tried to ignore them. We received numerous complaints and cracked down on those operating at traffic signals. This time we let them go with a strict warning but next time they will be convicted, said deputy commissioner of police A.J. Mouryah.        
	But that has not deterred the alms-and-the-men.        
	According to the states social welfare board, Tamil Nadu has some 50,000 beggars, most of them concentrated in bigger cities and pilgrim centres. In Bannari, where Periasamy operates, there are over 100 beggars who badger pilgrims visiting the Bannari Amman temple there.        
	Palani, one of the most famous pilgrim centres in the state, has over a thousand beggars, according to one estimate. The police say the begging mafia is very strong and beggars merely relocate if the cops come down hard on them.        
	Paul Sunder Singh, the director of Karunalaya Social Service Society, an NGO that works with street children, says a beggar can earn up to Rs 100 on a good day.        
	On festival days, they collect even more. So when we try to convince them that they can earn a decent amount by selling pens and cleaning clothes, they are not enthused. So we target child beggars by giving them food, shelter and education and also teach them skills like candle-making and bookbinding.

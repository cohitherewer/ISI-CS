          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 11: The Supreme Court today permitted a Muslim student to go back to the Bhopal convent school from where he was thrown out for refusing to adhere to a no-beard rule.         
	Mohammed Salim was expelled last December by the Nirmala Convent Higher Secondary School for violating the rule that required all students to be clean shaven.        
	The bench of Justices B.N. Aggarwal and G.S. Singhvi found the case prima facie ridiculous. The judges asked the school to explain its stand on the no-beard rule and permitted the Class X student to go back to the institution till the issue was decided.        
	Salim lost his case in the high court, which recognised the schools right to frame its own bylaws as a minority institution. He lost in the apex court, too, but that judgment was later withdrawn amid a controversy over comments of a judge who said that allowing beards would be tantamount to permitting Talibanisation.        
	When the hearing resumed today, Justice Aggarwal said: How can you stop someone from coming to school because he has a beard? Next, you will say that fair-complexioned students will not be allowed. Singhvi said: Then you will say that those students with earrings are not allowed.        
	Salims lawyer said the boy could not afford to go to another school. The court agreed. The student will be permitted to pursue studies in the same institution, it said.

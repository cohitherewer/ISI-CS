          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 23: A day before a meeting convened by the Union home minister in New Delhi to discuss strategies to counter Maoists, the rebels today blew up three schools and a hospital building in K. Bolang police station area in Sundargarh district on the Orissa-Jharkhand border.        
	However, there was no casualty or injury, as panicked villagers deserted the area after withdrawal of forces from there. The villagers had blocked the NH-215 yesterday, demanding police protection.        
	Inspector-general of police (operation) Sanjiv Marik told The Telegraph that the Maoists had blown up a public health centre and ME High School buildings at Jharbeda, UP School at Mahupada and another school at Sanabalijore  all in the Saranda forest on the Jharkhand border.        
	At least 50 Maoists blasted the school at Sanabalijore late last night. The group swooped on Mahupada UP School around 9am today and blew it up, police sources said. Around noon, they came to Jharbeda and blasted ME High School around 12.30pm. On their way back, they blew up the primary health centre building. Fortunately, there was no casualty or injury, as the patients had left the health centre with the villagers yesterday, said an officer of K. Bolang police station.        
	Police reinforcement was also sent to launch combing operations in the forest, he said. The schools were targeted as paramilitary jawans used to take shelter there during operations.        
	Sundargarh district collector Shalini Pandit and superin tendent of police Diptesh Patnaik rushed to K. Bolang to make necessary arrangements for the people, who had fled their villages. Later this afternoon, the villagers have lifted the road blockade, he added.

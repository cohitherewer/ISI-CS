The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Relief at return to Indira mould
                                                                                                               Relief at return to Indira mould
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Manmohan Singh                                  
	New Delhi, July 6: Partys verdict  political document by a true Congressman.        
	For conservatives in the Congress, Pranab Mukherjees budget marked a return to the pre-1991 era when the governments annual financial statement was a political document bereft of technical and economic jargon.        
	To the reformists, it was a judicious mix of medium-term fiscal prudence and long-term institutional reforms that wasnt really bold on divestment.        
	But both camps agreed the budget had Pranabdas chhaap (imprint). Somewhat like homeopathic medicine. Safe and cautious, said a young MP.        
	The conservatives, who had looked askance at the reforms era flagged off by Manmohan Singh under P.V. Narasimha Raos tutelage, were delighted with Mukherjee for breathing life into the ghosts of the past. They referred to his allusions to bank nationalisation and to PSUs as the wealth of the nation. The Congress is very much in the Indira Gandhi mould, a source said. This is what the budget signals.        
	The Congress is relieved that in the general climate of economic gloom, the budget managed to not only protect the interests of the vulnerable sections but also increase outlays for social sector schemes.        
	With zero revenue returns and global depression, the Centre has not compromised on its social commitments, a central minister said.        
	The Prime Minister, too, lauded Mukherjee. The budget was aimed at minimising the impact of the global recession, PTI quoted him as saying. The finance minister, Singh added, had done an admirable job.        
	A source said Mukherjee had passed the litmus test of what it takes to be a true Congressman. A political animal and not a technocrat or a bureaucrat like his predecessors from the party were, the minister added in a mild swipe at P. Chidambaram and Singh.        
	Another minister said Mukherjee had adopted the Left model of spending more and more but on the poor.        
	A source said the partys rank and file saw it as a betrayal of the mandate when the Centre hiked petro prices last week. We had to sweeten the bitter pill in large doses. Hopefully the budget has done that.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, July 12: Amrutamonohi land of Lord Jagannath cannot be resettled in favour of the Puri temple administration, Orissa High Court has ruled.        
	The court, however, made it clear that the Amrutamonohi land  extensive properties endowed to Lord Jagannath and in possession of matths and other religious institutions connected with the Puri temple as trustees  can only be put up for sale with the temple administration as one of the executants of the sale deed.        
	The verdict assumes significance as nearly 44,535 acres of land in Puri were recorded as Amrutamonohi land, but were vested in the government in 1974. In Cuttack, nearly 4,577 acres and another 3,544 acres in Balasore were recorded as Amrutamonohi land.        
	The land were endowed in the nature of Amrutamonohi with the avowed purpose that the usufructs (profits) from the property should be used as a food offering (bhog) to Lord Jagannath in Puri.         
	In case any alienation of Amrutamonohi land is made 75 per cent of the consideration money as per the market value obtained on account of such alienation shall be deposited with the temple administration for being used as food offering to Lord Jagannath, Justice B.P. Das and Justice M.M. Das ruled.        
	The balance 25 per cent will be taken by the marfatdar/mahanta of the matth or religious institution as one-time measure so that the purchaser will not have to render the service attached to the property any further, the division bench said on Friday, while clarifying that the observations and directions would operative prospectively.        
	The court was ruling on petitions filed on behalf of Sri Sidha Matha represented by Mahanta Satyanarayan Ramanuj Das and two others challenging applications filed by the Puri Jagannath Temple Administration for re-settlement of Amrutamonohi land under their possession.

	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 2: The raging debate over the granting of captive mines lease to industries acquired a new dimension with Rajya Sabha member Pyari Mohan Mohapatrwa opposing the system in principle.        
	Views of the senior BJD leader assume significance, as Mohapatra is widely known as the unofficial adviser to chief minister Naveen Patnaik and his government.        
	Ironically, the Naveen government has committed to several steel majors, including South Korean company Posco, that it would recommend to the Centre the granting of captive iron ore mines lease for their proposed steel plants to be set up in the state.        
	Inaugurating Steelrise 2009, a two-day conference on steel industries here today, Mohapatra said the companies might be given captive iron ore mines to meet their initial requirements up to 25 per cent. For the rest, there should be long-term commercial arrangements, he suggested.        
	The bureaucrat-turned-politician said several companies had been leased out vast iron ore mines in the state. However, a lot of resources remained unexploited as these companies were not inclined to do deep mining. The explorations had also been not scientific, he said.        
	Stating that the mineral-rich states get very little revenue from mining activities, Mohapatra said Orissa was earning revenue not even 5 per cent from the mineral resources.         
	The Centre has been persisting with the royalty rate of Rs 27 per tonne, while the Orissa government has been demanding revision of royalty at ad valorem rate of around 20 per cent.         
	But it has not happened. For this matter, relationship between the state and Centre is highly strained, he said.        
	As such, states like Orissa have suffered for decades because of poor infrastructure and there has been flight of capital to other developed states, he said.        
	Establishment of a steel plant was something like a mirage for decades. Of late, steel companies started coming to Orissa because of global boom and political stability. But there was a lot of complacency on the part of state administration during the first three years of the current decade, he added.        
	Some of the plants have come up despite belated efforts. But how much employment potential was created by mega plants in consonance with the peoples expectation? he asked.        
	Mohapatra advised the big industrial houses to engage the micro, small and medium-scale units for setting up downstream and ancillary units around the mother plants, which could generate huge employment.         
	On the knotty problem of displacement, he suggested to share a portion of companys stakes with the displaced families. Make them partners in progress which is the best solution to the displacement problem, he said.

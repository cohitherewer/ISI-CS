	Gaya, April 22: Maoist rebels killed a truck driver and set eight trucks on fire on the GT Road (NH-2) around 1.30am today, while observing the Bihar-Jharkhand bandh.        
	The deceased was identified as Laxman Yadav hailing from Bihars Rohtas, who was driving a truck with an Uttar Pradesh registration number. Yadav made an unsuccessful attempt to dodge the rebels while they were blocking the NH2. The men then fired at the trucks tyres deflating them and creating an accident.        
	This is the sixth time that rebels struck at Gaya in the past two weeks.         
	Todays attack on the trucks also included three empty oil tankers. The NH-2 where the attack took place is popularly known as the Grand Trunk Road and is a part of the golden quadrilateral project.A heavily-armed squad of the CPI(Maoist) intercepted the trucks passing through the GT Road near the Bihar-Jharkhand border  about 50km from here  under the Barachatti police station area of the district and torched the vehicles for violating the bandh  called to protest against the death of rebels by Jharkhand police at Latehar last week.        
	Previously, there was also a similar rebel attack that killed Archana Prasad, the wife of then Hazaribagh deputy commissioner Deepak Prasad, on November 12, 2000.        
	Gaya superintendent of police M.R. Naik said the driver was killed as he tried to escape mistaking the rebels to be highway robbers. He confirmed that this was not the first time that the Maoists had struck on the highway.

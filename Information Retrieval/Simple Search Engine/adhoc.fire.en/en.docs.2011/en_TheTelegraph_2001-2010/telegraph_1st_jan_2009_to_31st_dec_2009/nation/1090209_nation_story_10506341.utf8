The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Door ajar for Trinamul
                                                                                                               Door ajar for Trinamul
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 8: Sonia Gandhi today said alliances were there to stay but that should not deter Congress workers from trying to strengthen the party.        
	Sometimes alliances and seat adjustments are important but that should not come in the way of strengthening the party, the Congress chief said, ending a day-long convention of block and district party chiefs.        
	The meeting saw criticism of existing alliances with the Nationalist Congress Party in Maharashtra and the Rashtriya Janata Dal in Bihar. Most Bengal leaders warned against going with the Trinamul Congress, saying the Congress would lose whatever base it had with such a tie-up.        
	The Uttar Pradesh representatives had nothing to say about the still-to-be-clinched partnership with the Samajwadi Party, though some of them stressed the need to come to terms with the social realities: co-opting the backward castes and winning back the Dalits.        
	Sources said Sonia was keen on working with the Samajwadis and Trinamul because she is clear the BSP (in Uttar Pradesh) and the Left (in Bengal) must be contained so that circumstances are favourable to the UPA in a post-poll scenario and the Left is not in a position to dictate terms.        
	Sources said they expected the talks with the Samajwadis to resume and a deal to be signed after Wednesday.        
	The Congress is more or less reconciled to the entry of Kalyan Singh into the Samajwadi camp, though party leaders made it clear they would not share a platform with him.        
	In Lucknow, Mulayam Singh Yadav defended his decision to bring in Kalyan. He said the Congress could not wash its hands of its role in the events leading to the Babri demolition, when Kalyan was the BJP chief minister and P.V. Narasimha Rao the Congress Prime Minister.        
	Sources said other allies the Congress was looking at included the Janata Dal (Secular) in Karnataka and the Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam in Tamil Nadu.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 29: The health ministry today issued Indias first-ever flu guidelines for educational institutions that call on students and staff members to stay home for seven days if they have symptoms such as running nose, cough, or fever.         
	The guidelines also call on schools, colleges and other educational institutions to monitor the health of students as well as staff who may have come in contact with suspected cases of the pandemic H1N1 influenza.         
	While individuals with symptoms can stay home, the institutions have been asked to remain open. The initiative, as reported last week by The Telegraph, is intended to prevent the spread of flu through educational institutions and prevent any panic. The guidelines also call on educational institutions to discourage students and staff excursions to flu-affected countries.         
	Over the past two weeks, at least 80 children in several schools in Delhi and Pune have been found infected with the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. Boarding schools have been advised to send boarders who show such symptoms home to prevent the spread of infection and told that in-house care-givers should take standard precautions of wearing face masks and washing hands regularly.         
	The guidelines for the first time signal a subtle shift from the governments current policy of testing all suspected cases and treating every case of H1N1 with the anti-viral drug oseltamivir.         
	A senior medical expert said the H1N1 virus has so far caused only mild symptoms in India and there appears no real need to test every suspected case and offer the anti-viral drug oseltamivir to every patient. The drug should be ideally reserved for only those who are particularly vulnerable or those who develop serious disease, the expert told The Telegraph.         
	The number of patients in India confirmed to have been infected with H1N1 has climbed to 498. More than 370 patients have already been discharged, while the others are in isolation wards in government hospitals.         
	Although there is no evidence of community spread of H1N1 in India yet, medical experts point out that India currently does not even test people who have had no history of travel or no history of contact with infected persons.         
	We need to conduct surveillance of other people who have flu like symptoms in communities to determine if the virus has already spread, said a senior internal medicine specialist.

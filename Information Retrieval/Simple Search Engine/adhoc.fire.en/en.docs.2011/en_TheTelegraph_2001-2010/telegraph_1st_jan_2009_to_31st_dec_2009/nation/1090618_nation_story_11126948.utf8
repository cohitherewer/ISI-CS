The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Diary test for MP ministers
                                                                                                               Diary test for MP ministers
  - Chauhan tells team to record activities for appraisal        RASHEED KIDWAI                          Chauhan                                        
	Bhopal, June 17: A diary will decide the fate of Madhya Pradesh ministers.        
	Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan, whose image took a beating in the elections, has asked ministerial colleagues to maintain a yearly diary listing all programmes and tours and produce it for periodic appraisal.        
	At a meeting last night, Chauhan told colleagues that he would enforce transparency and accountability at all levels of administration. For starters, he and his ministers would have to account for their daily routine and work schedule.         
	For this, Chauhan has made it mandatory for his 35 ministers to maintain notes of their tours and meetings and record the action taken.        
	The chief minister said he was dismayed to note that some of his colleagues and senior bureaucrats were not spending considerable time in office and in the field.        
	Field visits are tours to districts and night stay in villages to find out if government schemes are reaching the people.        
	Chauhans diary diktat is seen as his attempt to tone up the administration. At 52, Chauhan, who was re-elected chief minister in November 2008, is being seen as one of the future beacons of the BJP who is acceptable to a wide section of people and partymen wary of aggressive Hindutva. Besides, he is also seen to have so far provided a generally efficient administration.         
	But the Lok Sabha poll results robbed him of some of the shine as the Congress made inroads and won 12 of the states 29 seats.         
	In the last one month of introspection, the chief minister is said to have zeroed in on callousness as a root cause for the seat dip. Chauhan discovered that in many districts where the BJP performed poorly, his ministers had not bothered to tour.        
	Though a formal report of the causes of defeat will be presented at the BJP national executive scheduled for June 20-21 in Delhi, Chauhan is said to have accepted the blame for the partys below par performance.        
	In the last few weeks, the chief minister has started spending a lot more time in the state secretariat at Vallabh Bhavan, which is mired in red tape and is notorious for tardy functioning.        
	Chauhan has begun the practice of reaching office at 9.30am and staying on past 5.30pm. With their boss in on time, the babus, who were in the habit of arriving late and leaving early, are now on their toes as Chauhan has started summoning senior officials from 9.30am.         
	Panchayat and rural development minister Gopal Bhargava said he was grateful to the chief minister for leading from the front.         
	My own experience in public life is that if the minister is not alert, the bureaucracy too starts taking a lot for granted. Today I am happy to note that I and my officials are lot more attentive, he said.        
	Former state chief minister Babulal Gaur said: I record everything, whether I am in Bhopal or on a visit to Kuala Lumpur, London or Beijing.        
	You can see who had tea with me, who came and met and which delegation arrived when. It is a story of my life.

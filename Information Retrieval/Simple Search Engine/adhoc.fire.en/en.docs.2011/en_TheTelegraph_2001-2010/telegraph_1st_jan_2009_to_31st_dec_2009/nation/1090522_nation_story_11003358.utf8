The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Protest date in Srinagar
                                                                                                               Protest date in Srinagar
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Srinagar, May 21: The separatist Hurriyat Conference today set the ball rolling for a new agitation in Kashmir.         
	Thousands turned up to join its march to Srinagars Idgah in the first big show of strength after last years successful Assembly elections.        
	Buoyed by the response, the chairman of the moderate Hurriyat faction, Mirwaiz Umer Farooq, said a new political agitation would begin on July 13 with a rally. Nearly 25,000 in the audience greeted the announcement by shouting separatist slogans.         
	Kashmir was rocked by the worst anti-India protests in decades last year against land allotment to the Amarnath shrine board. But the successful elections took the steam out of the separatists campaign. The Amarnath agitation has now almost died down in the villages, but Srinagar remains surcharged.        
	The occasion for todays rally was the death anniversary of Umers father, Mirwaiz Mohammad Farooq, killed by gunmen two decades ago.         
	The Omar Abdullah government allowed it, in a break from its policy of preventing any anti-India protest by force.        
	July 13 is observed as martyrs day to commemorate the sacrifices of people fighting Dogra rule. Umer said the agitation was planned two months later to give the new Union government time to take forward the process of resolving the Kashmir issue. The separatists will use this time to forge unity in their ranks.         
	Todays rally betrayed divisions among them as Umer did not pay tribute to slain separatist leader Abdul Gani Lone, whose death anniversary also falls today and was jointly observed with the Mirwaizs in the past. Lones son Sajjad fought the Lok Sabha elections.

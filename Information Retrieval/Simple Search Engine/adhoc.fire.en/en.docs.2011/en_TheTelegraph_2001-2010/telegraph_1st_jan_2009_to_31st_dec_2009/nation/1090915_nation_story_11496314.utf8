The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Gujarat jolt to Cong comeback dream 
                                                                                                               Gujarat jolt to Cong comeback dream 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 14: The Congress leadership is disappointed by the outcome of bypolls in Gujarat as its hopes of projecting Narendra Modi as a waning force lie shattered.        
	The Congress had started dreaming of the partys revival in the state after the ruling BJPs recent defeats in a series of civic polls and its inability to sweep the Lok Sabha election. The Congress lost five seats to the BJP in the September 10 bypolls to seven constituencies.        
	Gujarat wasnt the only damper, though. The Congress got a rude awakening in Uttarakhand, where the BJP reversed its losing trend and won a seat that gave its government a majority in the Assembly on its own. The Congress, which won all the five Lok Sabha seats in the hill state, had presumed that the BJP had fallen on tough days.        
	Publicly, the Congress put up a brave front on todays results, accusing Modi of misusing government machinery in every constituency.         
	Party general secretary B.K. Hariprasad said the state government had staked its might to win the polls as the contests were being seen as an acid test for Modi. The outcome is not a setback for the Congress at all, Hariprasad asserted, as the party has succeeded in exposing Modi on all fronts.        
	Party spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi sought to play down the setback, saying the results were not indicative of the political realities and that the Gujarat chief ministers decline was irreversible.        
	But many leaders conceded in private that the Gujarat results were, indeed, shocking.               
	Modi survives on passion and he would have (been) terribly weakened if the signals of his decline had been strengthened. He will try to use this reprieve to revive his fortunes, one leader said.

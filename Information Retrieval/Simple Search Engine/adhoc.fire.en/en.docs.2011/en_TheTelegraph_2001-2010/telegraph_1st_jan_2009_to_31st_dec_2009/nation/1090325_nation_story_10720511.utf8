                                                                                                               Father points finger at govt
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             Soumya (top), Jigisha                                 
	New Delhi, March 24: Soumya Vishwanathans father is relieved her suspected killers have been caught. Jigisha Ghoshs father wants the four to be hanged for murdering his daughter.        
	Delhi police today arrested four youths in the murders of TV journalist Soumya and IT executive Jigisha. Both were murdered on a deserted stretch near Vasant Kunj.         
	I am very happy. I am satisfied with how the case was investigated. We have full faith in the polices efforts, said Soumyas father M.K. Vishwanathan.         
	Jigishas father was happy that her killers had been caught within 72 hours of her body being found. The retired central government employee, said: They (the youths) should be hanged.         
	He added: We are happy they have been caught, but can we ever forgive the authorities for making this city so unsafe for our daughters? What did she do to die in such a manner? Why didnt the police stop the car when she was being held at gunpoint? These are questions that will haunt me throughout my life.        
	The wails of Jigishas mother could be heard from outside the Ghosh home in the CPWD Colony.        
	Soumyas mother, Madhavi Viswanathan, said she understood what the Ghoshes were going through.        
	When the news of Jigishas death reached the Vishwanathans, they initially tried not to read the newspapers.        
	I still wake up with a start, fearing some other girl might be in the same situation as my Soumya was on that lonely stretch. I still think sometimes that she will return and ring the bell at 4am, announcing she is home, Madhavi said, suppressing a sob.         
	Perhaps, it was worse for Jigisha. She was almost home, she added.         
	The worst part is that the government isnt bothered about our girls. There are many who still travel on that lonely stretch. Even now, the streetlights are not switched on at night. We cannot make our daughters sit at home in the fear that they might get murdered if they get out of the house. I am happy that these two girls have at least got justice, Madhavi said.         
	Jagannath said Jigisha had been planning to quit her job to do social work.         
	Two days before she went missing, she had come back from a trip to the Golden Temple and Vaishnodevi, where she had done some social work. She was a simple girl who was happy to help anyone who approached her. Maybe her simple nature made her decide to help a stranger even at that hour, said the tearful father.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Naveen Patnaik chairs a meeting to deal with farmer suicides in Bhubaneswar on Wednesday. (Sanjib Mukherjee)                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 28: Faced with peasant agitation following farmer suicides, chief minister Naveen Patnaik today announced a slew of short-term and long-term measures to deal with the situation arising out of erratic rainfall and pest attack.        
	At least seven farmers  most of them small and marginal  committed suicide for reported crop failure and debt in recent weeks.        
	Presiding over a high-level meeting to discuss follow-up measures on the basis of agriculture production commissioner R.N. Senapatis report, Naveen today announced to pay compensation to the pest-affected farmers at the rate of Rs 2,000 per hectare for un-irrigated land and Rs 4,000 per hectare for irrigated land.        
	Senapati visited affected areas in Sambalpur and Jharsuguda districts recently on Naveens direction.        
	As per an official estimate, kharif crop in 88,979 hectares in 12 districts has been affected by pest attack. It was also decided to construct 1 lakh farm ponds every year in the land of small and marginal farmers, particularly in rain-fed areas, to ensure irrigation to agricultural land during dry period.        
	This year, kharif crops in several hilly districts were badly hit by erratic rainfall.        
	The chief minister asked the officials to take up farm fund construction on war footing and achieve the target for construction of 5 lakh farm ponds within next five years. If necessary, community tanks would be constructed on government lands in rural areas, he said.        
	Naveen also instructed officials of water resources department to take up renovation of minor irrigation projects in large scale this year with an estimated cost of Rs 300 crore.         
	He also stressed on energisation of defunct lift irrigation points on war footing.        
	A secretary-level committee was formed to monitor and co-ordinate farm-related programmes.

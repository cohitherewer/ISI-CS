The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Calcutta land test for NSG hub
                                                                                                               Calcutta land test for NSG hub
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 13: Land, more than manpower, has been difficult to find for the four new National Security Guard hubs, one of which will come up in Calcutta.        
	The hubs  the others in Hyderabad, Mumbai and Chennai  may not be located in or even near the cities. In that case, we would have to look at the need for choppers for transport to the airport or for road connectivity to be improved said a source.        
	The NSG would have liked 100 acres close to airports, sources said, but finding land, especially in Bengal, is proving difficult.         
	In Bengal, where land acquisition has been a dirty word after Nandigram and Singur, the state government may stay away from another potential misadventure.         
	Each hub will have no more than 400 men.         
	Sources said home minister P. Chidambaram had asked the force to provide a detailed requirement list of rations, weaponry and logistics. At least two special aircraft  IL-76 or AN-32 transport aircraft  will be provided to the commandos.

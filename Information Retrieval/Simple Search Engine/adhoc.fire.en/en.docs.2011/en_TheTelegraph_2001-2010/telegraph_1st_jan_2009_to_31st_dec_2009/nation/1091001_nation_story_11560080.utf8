          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 30: Erratic and scanty rainfall is threatening kharif paddy yield in a few hilly districts of Orissa, even as heavy rain lashed the coastal belt in recent weeks.        
	The state has so far received 22 per cent less rainfall than normal during this monsoon.        
	Hilly and drought-prone districts like Nuapada, Nowrangpur, Malkangiri, Koraput, Deogarh, Sundargarh and Mayurbhanj have experienced erratic and scanty rainfall, affecting the kharif paddy crops.        
	Paddy crops cultivated in about 7,000 hectares in Nuapada district alone have suffered more than 50 per cent damage due to prolonged dry spell and moisture stress, said agriculture minister Damodar Rout.        
	A target had been set last year to cover 36.42 lakh hectares of cropped land under kharif paddy. The target for kharif paddy crop coverage this year has been reduced to 36.11 lakh hectares, keeping the erratic and scanty rainfall in some areas in view, he said.        
	Apart from the crop loss due to dry spell, paddy crop in an estimated 70,000 hectares in some districts has been affected due to pest attack. Last year, the state had produced 9.30 lakh tonnes of rice in excess of its internal requirement. This year, the state may not have surplus due to the erratic and scanty rainfall as well as pest attack, but it will not experience scarcity either, Rout said.        
	The coastal belt, which had reeled from heavy flood last year, will have better paddy yield this year, he said.        
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik asked officials to chalk out a contingency plan to save kharif crops.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Demand to scrap Vedanta MoU
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Demand to scrap Vedanta MoU
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Anil Agarwal: Flak from MLAs                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 2: Citing rich mineral reserves along the Puri coast, the Opposition today demanded scrapping of the MoU signed with UK-based Anil Agarwal Foundation for establishment of the Vedanta University near the beach town and cancellation of land allotment.        
	Raising the issue during the zero hour in the Assembly, Congress member S.S. Saluja said the Union minister of state for science and technology, Prithviraj Chauhan had told the Rajya Sabha yesterday that deposits of around 1.82 million tonnes of thorium-mixed monozite were found along the Puri coast, where the proposed Vedanta University is coming up. Such rare minerals are used in the generation of atomic energy.        
	If such precious land is handed over to the Anil Agarwal Foundation and it exports the rare minerals, there will be a huge revenue loss to the state. Besides, the sea level would rise if these minerals are mined, leading to submergence of Puri town and the 12th century Jagannath temple, he apprehended, while demanding scrapping of the MoU signed between the state government and Anil Agarwal Foundation.        
	The MoU was signed between the Orissa government and Anil Agarwal Foundation in July 2006 for establishment of a private world-class university near Puri with an investment of Rs 15,000 crore. The government had committed to allot 6,000 acres along the Puri-Konark marine drive for the proposed university and a major chunk of it has already been handed over to the Anil Agarwal Foundation.        
	Sharing the concern, Opposition whip Prasad Harichandan said Chauhan had quoted the information provided by the Atomic Minerals Directorate of the Union government. A nuclear scientist from Orissa had also earlier stated in his technical paper that there are deposits of thorium and other rare earth minerals along the Orissa coast from Gopalpur to Jagatsinghpur.        
	NCP leader Amar Satpathy wanted to know whether any survey had been conducted. Stating that Orissa was facing energy crisis due to fall in hydro power generation, Satpathy said there was a need for alternative source of energy.

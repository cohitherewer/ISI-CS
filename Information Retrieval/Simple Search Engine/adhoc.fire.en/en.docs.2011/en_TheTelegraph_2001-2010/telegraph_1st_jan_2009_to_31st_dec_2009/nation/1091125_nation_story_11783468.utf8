The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ram scuffle in House
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Ram scuffle in House
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Amar Singh (left) and SS Ahluwalia after the scuffle in the Rajya Sabha. (Rajesh Kumar)                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 24: The Rajya Sabha today witnessed fisticuffs between the Samajwadi Partys Amar Singh and the BJPs S.S. Ahluwalia, and a rare moment when some Opposition party leaders shouted slogans for former Congress Prime Minister Narasimha Rao.         
	Soon after home minister P. Chidambaram tabled the Liberhan commission report on the Babri Masjid demolition, Ahluwalia and other BJP leaders started yelling jai Shri Ram in the House.        
	An angry Amar got up and advanced towards Ahluwalia. He loudly objected to the slogans, then tried to push Ahluwalia but was pushed back by him. Other members soon joined and a scuffle broke out.         
	In the commotion, some BJP leaders shouted jai Rao, a mischievous dig at the Congress whose Prime Minister Narasimha Rao was accused of looking the other way while the mosque crumbled.        
	After the scuffle, Ahluwalia made the first gesture of truce in a lighter vein.         
	He went up to the general secretary of the Samajwadi Party, which is trying hard to win back Muslims in Uttar Pradesh, and said: So, to curry favour with Muslims you are targeting a sardar?         
	It was not known how Amar took the joke, but when he came out of the House, he was ready to apologise to Ahluwalia. I am ready to apologise to Ahluwalia. I didnt want to manhandle him. He raised slogans that had the potential of dividing the House along communal lines. I asked Ahluwalia not to raise such slogans, Amar said.         
	He was shouting jai Shri Ram. This is our temple (referring to the Parliament). It has no religious affiliation. I am a Ram devotee myself. But Ram is not our political figure.        
	Ahluwalia, though, maintained there was no provocation for Amar to behave the way he did.         
	Amar said no such incident had taken place earlier and whatever happened today was because of emotions.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Magician shows win not a fluke
                                                                                                               Magician shows win not a fluke
          RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR                            Raje, Gehlot                          
	Jaipur, May 17: The one-time magician has trounced the maharani again.        
	Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, said to have wowed little Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka with his magic skills years ago, has scored back-to-back victories against the arrogant Vasundhara Raje who allegedly often mocked him as a kangaal (pauper).        
	The self-effacing Gehlot, under whom the Congress yesterday returned 20 MPs to the Lok Sabha, has taken the sting out of Vasundharas jibe that his 2008 Assembly victory was a fluke.        
	The Congress won the Assembly elections by fluke as it failed to get an absolute majority. Let Gehlot show his prowess in the Lok Sabha elections, the BJPs Vasundhara had been saying so far.        
	The 20-MP tally logged by Gehlots regime is the Congresss best performance in Rajasthan since 1984 when it won 25 seats. Pollsters had not foreseen the tally crossing 15, but Gehlots candidate-selection skills and mobilisation of grassroots workers are now being lauded.        
	Sources said Gehlot had taken it on himself to mobilise party workers as well as consolidate caste leaders behind him so that the Congress could project a united face. To achieve his target he campaigned relentlessly, addressing over 200 meetings in the draining heat.        
	He also picked a lot of young candidates, including people from outside the state, as part of his strategy. There was much grumbling within the party but the gamble has paid off.        
	Sources said when Gehlot gave the Nagaur ticket to Jyoti Mirdha, a 36-year-old doctor living in Delhi, many raised their eyebrows. But the chief minister stuck by her, insisting her family name would be a winner. Jyoti won by over 1.55 lakh votes.        
	The case was somewhat similar with Chandresh Kumari, the Himachal-based sister of erstwhile royal Gaj Singh. She contested from Jodhpur and won by over 98,000 votes.        
	So also with royal scion Ijjyaraj Singh, who was given the ticket from Kota though he had never contested before. He won by over 83,000 votes.        
	Gehlot, who belongs to the maali (gardener) community, is a hard-core organisation man and has worked tirelessly to rebuild the Congress since his 2003 defeat. His clean image and fight-to-the-finish spirit have worked in his favour.        
	With rival Vasundhara now lying battered and dissenting voices holding her solely responsible for BJPs Rajasthan rout, the chief minister could well be on a roll.

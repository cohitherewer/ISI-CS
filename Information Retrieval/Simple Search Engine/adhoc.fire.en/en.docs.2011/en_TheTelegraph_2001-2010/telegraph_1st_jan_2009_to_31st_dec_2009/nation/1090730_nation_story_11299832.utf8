The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | SC notice to Anand on raising penalty
                                                                                                               SC notice to Anand on raising penalty
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, July 29: The Supreme Court today rapped Delhi High Court for being lenient on lawyer R.K. Anand, convicted of trying to induce a witness in the BMW hit-and-run case, and served him a showcause on why his punishment should not be enhanced.        
	The punishment awarded by the high court was wholly inadequate and incommensurate to the seriousness of his actions and conduct, a three-judge bench said.         
	Anand has eight weeks to reply. He had been prohibited  along with special public prosecutor I.U. Khan  from appearing in the high court and subordinate courts for four months last year. But both were free to carry on other professional activities, like consultations and offering advice.        
	They appealed to the Supreme Court, which let off Khan with a rap but came down heavily on Anand.         
	The apex court asked high courts to frame within four months rules specifying the time for which such lawyers could be disbarred.        
	It also said court permission wasnt required to carry out stings as it would tantamount to hurting medias freedom. The telecast of stings wouldnt constitute criminal contempt, it said.         
	Bar councils were asked to ensure high standards.

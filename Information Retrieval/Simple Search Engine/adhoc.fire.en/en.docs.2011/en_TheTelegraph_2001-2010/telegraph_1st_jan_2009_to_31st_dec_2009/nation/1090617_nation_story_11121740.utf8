	Patna, Jun 16 (PTI): Resolving to take the Lok Sabha election debacle in its stride, the RJD legislature party today expressed unflinching faith in Lalu Prasad.        
	This is a meeting of the legislature party to express unflinching faith in the leadership of party president Lalu Prasad and our leader in the state legislature Rabri Devi. It vows to highlight the issues of public concern forcefully in the legislature and wage a decisive battle for the respect of the poor, the backward and the minorities, stated a resolution that was adopted at the meeting, the first-ever after the partys defeat in the polls.        
	The resolution also identified a split in the secular votes as the foremost reason for the electoral reverses, but felt that RJDs support base remained intact.        
	Addressing the meeting, Lalu asked RJD legislators to highlight problems faced by people under the NDA regime, headed by Nitish Kumar.        
	Victory and defeat are only natural in politics, but we should never forget our duty towards people. Let us renew our commitment to fulfilling our duty to the people of Bihar, Lalu said.         
	Stating that the party had always stood by secularism and had never compromised its ideology even in adverse situations, Lalu said that he was not shaken by the election outcome, as he still had the support of his party that was committed to principles of social justice.         
	He announced meetings of district, block and panchayat presidents to be held at Patna on June 20 to discuss measures for strengthening the organisation at the grassroots. Workers conferences will also be held at divisional-level between June 27 and August 2 to establish effective communication with RJD base, he said.         
	The resolution also accused Nitish Kumar government of having failed to rein in crime and corruption.

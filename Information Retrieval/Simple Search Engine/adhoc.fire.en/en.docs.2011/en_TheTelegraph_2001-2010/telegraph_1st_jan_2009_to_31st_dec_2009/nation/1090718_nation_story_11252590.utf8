          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chandigarh, July 17: Navjot Singh Sidhu has allegedly submitted his resignation to BJP leader L.K. Advani, peeved by the partys decision to appoint his rival as head of the Amritsar Improvement Trust against his wishes.        
	The former cricketer, who is now the Amritsar MP, met Advani and handed him the letter saying he wanted to resign from the primary membership of the BJP and from the Lok Sabha, a Punjab BJP leader said.         
	The MP is believed to have cited the appointment of Rajinder Mohan Singh Chhina as chairman of the Amritsar Improvement Trust as his reason for quitting, the BJP leader said.         
	Sidhu could not be contacted and his wife said she was unaware of his decision. I am not sure he has resigned, Navjot, Sidhus wife, said. I have also heard about it but have not yet spoken to him.         
	Advani, however, refused to accept the letter, the Punjab BJP leader said, as the party wanted to sort out the matter amicably.

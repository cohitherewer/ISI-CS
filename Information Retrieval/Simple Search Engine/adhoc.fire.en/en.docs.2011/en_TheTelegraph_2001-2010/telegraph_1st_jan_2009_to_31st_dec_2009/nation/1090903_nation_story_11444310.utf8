                                                                                                               Suchitras brush with casting couch
          
	Mumbai, Sept. 2 (PTI): Actress Suchitra Krishnamoorthi has revealed that a prominent filmmaker asked her to spend the night with him when she was a struggling teenager looking for a break, recounting her scary brush with the casting couch.        
	She managed to escape, the singer-actress wrote in her blog, but the incident left a scar in her mind for a long time.        
	I remember many years ago, while still in my teens, I had gone to meet a very successful producer regarding a film role at a plush suburban hotel. They were looking for a new face to launch, Suchitra wrote without disclosing the name of the producer.        
	The actress said after a general discussion about academics, her family and work experience, the producer asked her to call her father.        
	Tell him, he told her, you are spending the night with me at the hotel and that he should come and pick you up in the morning, Suchitra wrote in her blog.        
	As she panicked and started gathering her belongings to leave, the producer, Suchitra recalled, became irritated.        
	I know you are a good girl but if you want to become an actress you have to do it! So and so and so and so (he named some of the top league actresses of that time)  do it. She do it and even she do it! They are my discovery. Everybody has to do it (sic), the producer told her, she wrote in her blog.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong flays Raman govt
                                                                                                               Cong flays Raman govt
          SHEENA K.                               
	Raipur, July 20: Opposition Congress today bayed for chief minister Raman Singhs blood and blamed the state government for the recent Madanwada Maoist attacks that killed 36 policemen, including superintendent of police Vinod Kumar Choubey (in picture).        
	Congress members did not allow the House to transact business today even as the monsoon session of the Chhattisgarh Assembly began.        
	We will not allow the House to transact any business till the chief minister puts in his papers for the governments failure that resulted in Madanwada incident on July 12, said leader of the Opposition Ravindra Choubey.        
	The 38-member Congress legislature party had earlier planned to put the director general of police Vishwaranjan on the dock for the Madanwada incident during the 10-day monsoon session.         
	Making last minute changes in the strategy, the Opposition trained their gun on Raman Singh. The chief minister has to go as he is heading an incompetent government, Choubey said, adding that Raman Singh could not escape his responsibility for the serious negligence committed by his government.         
	Soon after the obituary references, Congress members created pandemonium inside the House; displaying placards with slogans demanding the resignation. Amid the uproar, the chief minister said the government was ready for a discussion.         
	But, Choubey rejected it stating that discussions would not help as the government would only try to cover up its mistakes. After two brief adjournments, Speaker Dharamlal Kaushik adjourned the House for the day.

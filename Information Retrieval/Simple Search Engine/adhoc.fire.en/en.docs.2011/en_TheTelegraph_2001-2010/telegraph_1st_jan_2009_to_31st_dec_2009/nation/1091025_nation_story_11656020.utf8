The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | IITs accept new pay 
                                                                                                               IITs accept new pay 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 24: IIT teachers today decided to accept a controversial new pay regime, ending a two-month dispute with the human resource development ministry  but with a cautionary threat that unfulfilled promises could trigger fresh criticism.         
	The All India IIT Faculty Federation  which has spearheaded the teachers protest  today agreed to accept salaries offered by the government in the interest of the IIT system.        
	But the federation will continue to demand that the ministry and the boards of individual IITs fulfil a set of promises on the basis of which the protests have been called off.         
	We will accept the new pay regime but only because we expect the boards and the HRD ministry to fulfil their promises to us, IIT Madras professor M. Thenmozhi said, after a meeting of the federation at IIT Delhi.         
	However, Thenmozhi added that the faculty were disappointed with the initial signals emanating from the ministry and the IIT directors on fulfilling these promises.         
	HRD minister Kapil Sibal had announced that the new pay regime only aimed at setting guidelines which each individual board could tweak to meet the needs of the specific institution.         
	A key guideline that teachers across the IITs want their boards to now reconsider involves the time a fresh teacher must spend on contract before he can be absorbed into the regular faculty.         
	The new pay regime stipulates that fresh teachers must spend three years on contract before joining the regular faculty  a condition that the teachers have criticised as unattractive while luring young talent.         
	Sibal and the IIT directors had also announced that a committee would be formed  including faculty representatives  to work out details of a performance-related incentive scheme and a salary hike for some professors.        
	The panel was proposed to finalise criteria on the basis of which teachers were to be selected for a higher salary available only to 40 per cent of the professors.         
	The IIT directors had indicated that the panels proposals would be taken up at the IIT Council meeting on October 19. But the panel is yet to be formed.

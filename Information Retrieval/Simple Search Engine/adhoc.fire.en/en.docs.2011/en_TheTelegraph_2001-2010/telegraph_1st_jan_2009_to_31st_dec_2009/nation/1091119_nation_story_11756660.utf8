          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Nov. 18: Orissa High Court today adjourned hearing of a PIL on the multi-crore derivative scam till tomorrow after an affidavit submitted by the CBI indicated that it was a fit case for investigation by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) or the Enforcement Directorate.        
	Prabanjan Patra had filed the PIL seeking a CBI probe on an alleged Rs 25-lakh-crore derivative scam involving the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999, (Fema) violations.        
	The RBI had constituted an inter-departments group to review the derivative transactions. The group had found violation of regulatory guidelines which were of serious nature, CBI superintendent of police, New Delhi, Mahipal Yadav said in the affidavit.         
	Responding to it, the high court had on August 27 asked the CBI to submit a preliminary investigation report on November 4. The CBI, however, in an affidavit said: The derivative contracts entered into by various banks may be looked into by RBI itself and/or Enforcement Directorate on bank to bank basis with the object to pinpoint the violations of the Fema, and regulations framed there under and to take appropriate action.

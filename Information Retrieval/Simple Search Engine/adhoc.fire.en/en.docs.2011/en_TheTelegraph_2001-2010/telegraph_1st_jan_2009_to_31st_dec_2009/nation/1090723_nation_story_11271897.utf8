The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ploy to delink plot amp; boss: Prosecutor
                                                                                                               Ploy to delink plot amp; boss: Prosecutor
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                          Kasab at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus during the 26/11 attacks                                  
	Mumbai, July 22: Ajmal Kasabs admission of guilt in court could be a clever ploy to shield Lashkar-e-Toiba chief Hafiz Saeed and brush under the carpet details that expose a greater conspiracy.         
	Kasab, in his confessional statement to police, recorded before a magistrate last year, had mentioned Saeed as the mastermind of the 26/11 attacks.         
	The Lashkar chief, among the most wanted by India, is, however, yet to be chargesheeted by Pakistan and even earned a reprieve from a Lahore court which released him from house arrest a few weeks ago.         
	However, in Mondays statement to the court, Kasab omitted Saeeds name and instead tagged Lashkar commander Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi as mastermind.        
	Under Pakistans laws, any statement made by Kasab naming Saeed or any other person as the mastermind or facilitator in the Mumbai attacks would have no legal or moral value until made in an open court in India.        
	Pakistans criminal procedure code and anti-terrorism laws will not accept his police confession as evidence in the trial they hold for the Mumbai attackers. But, and it is a big but, their laws permit Pakistani courts to accept Kasabs statement made before an open court in India, special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam said.        
	In Islamabad, barrister Iqbal Haider, a former Pakistan law minister and attorney-general, agreed. It would have been advisable for the government of Pakistan to take appropriate action against Hafiz Saeed or any other person had Kasab named them in open court, he said.        
	Haider said any confession that Kasab made in the past or in police custody has no legal value in Pakistan, where only statements made in an open court are accepted. It is not obligatory for our government to take action against Hafiz Saeed on the basis of whatever Kasab said (to the police).         
	Under the Indian Penal Code, courts accept a police confession recorded before a magistrate, unless evidence proves otherwise.        
	The prosecution only needs to corroborate it with primary evidence. We have done it so far. Three-fourths of the trial is over and the rest of the evidence in our kitty is more damning. It will reveal the entire conspiracy, including Hafiz Saeeds role. He (Kasab) obviously wants to stop that, said Nikam.        
	Incidentally, Kasabs admission of guilt mentions all the people chargesheeted by Pakistan on Saturday. The Lashkar chief figures neither in the Pakistan chargesheet nor in Kasabs court statement.        
	There is a deeper motive behind his sudden U-turn, Nikam told the court today. Even the motives he has spoken about in the two are different.         
	In the police confession, Nikam pointed out, Kasab had said that Saeed had asked the team of 10 attackers to unleash terror by attacking Indian cities and turning India hollow from inside by bleeding it.        
	Yesterday, Kasab told the court the motive was religious and political.        
	He conveniently changed the motive to shield Hafiz Saeeds name. He is being instructed by somebody  it is strange how his statement reflects the Pakistani chargesheet that came two days before he began his act, Nikam alleged.        
	He also argued that Kasabs admission was a ploy to delink his trial from that of the two Indian accused in the case  Lashkar operatives Fahim Ansari and Sabauddin.        
	Fahim and Sabauddin have been charged with providing maps and other details to Lashkar handlers in Pakistan to facilitate the 26/11 attacks.        
	Kasab was arrested with such a map in his possession. He claimed in the police confession that he knew of the duo, but does not mention them in his recent admission.                    WITH INPUTS FROM NASIR JAFFRY IN ISLAMABAD

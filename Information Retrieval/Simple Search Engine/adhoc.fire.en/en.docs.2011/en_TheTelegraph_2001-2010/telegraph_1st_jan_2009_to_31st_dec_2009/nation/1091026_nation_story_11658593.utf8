          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                     
	Srinagar, Oct. 25: A mentally challenged man allegedly attacked a jawan with an axe and was shot dead in an army camp in Baramulla, triggering high-voltage protests four days before the Prime Minister is scheduled to visit Kashmir.        
	Sajjad Ahmad, a 24-year-old resident of Ganapora Langate, about 75km from Srinagar, was shot dead yesterday.        
	On October 28, Manmohan Singh will inaugurate an 18km rail track, which when complete will connect Jammu with Kashmir.        
	Some suspicious movement was seen near the Watargam camp. On being challenged, the man charged at the sentry with an axe and hit him on his head and right shoulder, causing serious injuries. He was reportedly mentally challenged, said Lt Col J.S. Brar, a defence ministry spokesman.        
	He said the youth also tried to attack other jawans and was shot dead in the camp in retaliatory gunfire.        
	Baramulla residents, who have been protesting since yesterday, demanded the soldiers who shot Sajjad be arrested. A magisterial probe has been ordered.        
	We are not satisfied with the government action. We want the soldiers to be arrested. Such statements are issued whenever an innocent is killed, said Langate MLA Sheikh Abdul Rashid.

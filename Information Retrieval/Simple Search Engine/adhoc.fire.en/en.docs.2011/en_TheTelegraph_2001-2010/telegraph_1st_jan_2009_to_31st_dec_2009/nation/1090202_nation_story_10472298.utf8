The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CPM runs down poll boss call
                                                                                                               CPM runs down poll boss call
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND PTI                      N Gopalaswami                          
	New Delhi, Feb. 1: The CPM today called for the rejection of the suo motu recommendation by the chief election commissioner to remove his colleague Navin Chawla, drawing a rare compliment from estranged ally Congress.        
	The suo motu recommendation by the chief election commissioner, N. Gopalaswami, to remove one of the election commissioners, Navin Chawla, is out of bounds and can only damage the institution of the Election Commission, the CPM politburo said in a statement.         
	Any suspicion that the members of this constitutional body are playing politics will harm the institution. The demand of the chief election commissioner should, therefore, be rejected, the statement added.        
	The Congress termed the CPM stand appropriate but did not comment on the rest of the statement that had some critical references to the ruling party as well as the BJP.        
	The politburo statement to the extent that the CEC has transgressed its jurisdiction is an appropriate conclusion, Congress spokesperson Manish Tiwari said.        
	However, the CPM statement criticised the Congress and the BJP for nominating their pet bureaucrats to the poll panel, leading to its degeneration. One of the steps that needs to be taken is to bar former members of the commission from taking up politically appointed positions or contesting elections, the CPM said.         
	In Calcutta, politburo member Brinda Karat criticised Gopalaswamis recommendation. The EC is supposed to play the role of an impartial referee. But the referee is making it clear that he is siding with one team when the match is about to begin, Karat told a Left meeting in Calcutta South, Mamata Banerjees constituency.        
	The CPM had skirmishes with the election commission during the last Bengal Assembly elections which were held over five phases and scrutiny was extremely tight.        
	The party also urged all political parties and citizens to suggest reforms necessary to safeguard the institution of the Election Commission.         
	An unfazed Gopalaswami told PTI that he was right in seeking his colleagues dismissal. In my mind, I am right, he was quoted as saying.        
	Asked about criticism on the timing of his recommendation  a few months before his retirement and the Lok Sabha polls  Gopalaswami said the petition reached him towards the end of January 2008.         
	In February, the commission was busy with preparations for the Karnataka Assembly polls, he said, adding that Chawla, who was on leave for some time, was given a copy of the petition last July and took six months to respond.        
	Referring to Chawlas assertion that the dignity of the commission was paramount, Gopalaswami said: Yes, I also hold the same dignity. I share the same dignity and credibility of the institution. What is credibility? It is only its neutrality.         
	If 179 MPs give a petition, I just cant throw it in the dustbin, he said, referring to the plea submitted by the BJP. I have to consider and apply my mind.

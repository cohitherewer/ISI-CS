The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Policy to cut down govt litigation
                                                                                                               Policy to cut down govt litigation
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                                          Moily: Backlog solution    
	New Delhi, Oct. 21: Law minister Veerappa Moily today said the government was drawing up a national policy to bring down the number of departmental litigation clogging up courts.        
	A government litigation policy is being formulated, which would involve compiling statistics and details about the number of cases being filed by every government department, he said at a media conference.         
	The government is the single-largest litigant in the country. At last count, over 30 million cases were pending in different courts, of which over 2 million were before lower courts. As a result, any case that lands up in court takes at least 15 years to be decided.        
	Sources said this waiting time could come down to three years if the government were to cut down on its litigation.        
	We will analyse the data and take steps to ensure that the curse of being the single-largest litigant is thinned down, Moily said.        
	A key component of Moilys ambitious roadmap for judicial reforms is to bring down the backlog and the time taken to decide a case.        
	The backlog, Moily said, has been increasing. Constantly increasing number of cases lead to a delay in delivering justice and denial of justice. Presently, it takes up to 15 years to dispose of a case. We propose to bring it down to three.        
	The minister said a national judicial arrears grid would be drawn up as the first step towards tackling the problem, as he briefed reporters on a two-day conference beginning tomorrow which hopes to find novel solutions.        
	Moily said the arrears grid would identify key bottlenecks, take steps to clear them, and ensure better court management and training and greater use of information technology.        
	His ministry, Moily added, will also consider former Law Commission chief Jagannath Raos proposal for a judicial impact assessment of laws, a suggestion the Supreme Court has come up with several times.        
	Rao had suggested that Parliament set aside a dedicated sum for the courts each time it drew up a law that opens the floodgates for litigation. This would equip the judiciary to upgrade infrastructure and manpower to deal with potential litigation.        
	Moily also said the government was planning to place three bills before the cabinet in a day or two as part of his roadmap for reforms.                    
	They include a comprehensive judges standards and accountability bill, which would replace the outdated Judges Inquiry Act, 1968; and another to ensure uniformity in pay scales and conditions of service of all heads of tribunals.        
	The third bill is aimed at facilitating the creation of high-value commercial courts in all 21 high courts. The commercial courts would deal with cases involving Rs 2 crore and more.        
	Moily said the government would also try and revamp the process of appointing judges. Judges are now appointed by an in-house procedure by judges themselves, and there has been a lot of criticism over whether the system has adequate checks to keep out tainted people.        
	We will not allow a single tainted person to enter the system, Moily said, though he refused to spell out details of his plan to revamp the appointment process.

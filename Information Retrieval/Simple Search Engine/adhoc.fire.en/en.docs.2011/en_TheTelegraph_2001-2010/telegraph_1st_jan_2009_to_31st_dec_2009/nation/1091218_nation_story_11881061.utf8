The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Language shift in PM climate pitch
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Language shift in PM climate pitch
          G.S. MUDUR                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 17: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today iterated Indias intention to contribute to the fight against climate change, but tweaked the language when pitching again a two-year-old per capita emissions gauntlet to industrialised countries.        
	In a statement issued before his departure for the Copenhagen climate summit, Singh recalled his own announcement from 2007 that India would maintain per capita emission at a level lower than the average per capita emissions of the developed countries.         
	Earlier, instead of lower, India had been using the word not exceed. The two expressions do not make much of a difference on the ground because per capita emission (the more the population, the less the individual emission figure) itself is a controversial concept but the Indian semantics switch is being seen as a sign of willingness to do more to reduce emission.        
	At the G8-plus-G5 climate change meeting of 2007 in Heiligendamm, Singh had said Indias per capita emissions would not exceed those of the developed countries. A position paper on climate change prepared by the Indian government also used similar language, stating that India would not allow its per capita emission to exceed the average of the developed countries.        
	Some climate policy analysts have pointed out that the per capita pitch should not be interpreted as a right to raise emission to the level of developed countries.         
	Indias per capita emission is about 1.2 tonnes carbon dioxide per year, while the US figure is about 20. Environment minister Jairam Ramesh had pointed out that India draws a per capita advantage only because of its high population.         
	Singh said that India, as a responsible member of the international community, would reduce the emissions intensity of our growth by 20 to 25 per cent from the 2005 level by 2020.         
	Singh addressed domestic concerns by saying climate change could not be addressed by perpetuating the poverty of the developing countries. Every citizen of the globe has equal entitlement of the global atmospheric space, he said.

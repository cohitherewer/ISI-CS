The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CM office push to Rosaiah
                                                                                                               CM office push to Rosaiah
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA AND RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	Sept. 13: The Congress high command has moved to enhance interim chief minister K. Rosaiahs authority, striking a further blow to Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddys ambitions of occupying the hot seat anytime soon.        
	Rosaiah has been asked to shift to the chief ministers official chamber, which he had avoided so far while his own ministers and MLAs declared support for Jaganmohan.        
	The central leadership has asked him to crack the whip on any cabinet colleague who questions his authority. Rosaiah has also been told he can pick his own chief secretary, director-general of police and bureaucrats in the chief ministers office.        
	Jaganmohans subtle campaign continued today, with this mornings edition of family-owned newspaper Sakshi carrying an extra sheet with a large picture of the late Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy. But his mentor K.V.P. Ramachandra Rao brought disappointing news from Delhi, where he spent five days meeting Sonia Gandhi and other leaders.        
	Rao returned yesterday to tell associates that a Union minister had told him the party did not want to risk putting the inexperienced Jaganmohan, 37, in charge when the state unit was so faction-ridden.         
	Rao flew back to Delhi today to continue lobbying.        
	The issue is proving a test for Sonia, who has so far refused to bow to pressure despite 148 of the states 156 Congress MLAs, all 33 MPs and all 34 of Rosaiahs ministers rooting for Jaganmohan. She is aware of YSRs commitment to the Nehru-Gandhi legacy, and the clout of the Reddy community in state politics.        
	Sonia knows the pitfalls of Delhi forcing its will on the state. The Congresss humiliating sacking of its chief minister, T. Anjaiah, in 1982 had helped the fledgling Telugu Desam of N.T. Rama Rao win the 1983 polls by playing up wounded Telugu pride.        
	The Congress is willing to make Jaganmohan deputy chief minister or a junior minister at the Centre, but he is not willing to accept them.        
	Sources said the high command had reservations about Jaganmohan and the way his campaign was run:        
	An AICC source questioned the suicide/heart attack tolls given out after YSRs death, saying: Our survey shows only three suicides and half-a-dozen heart attacks in comparison to 39 suicides and 300-odd heart attacks given out by the state Congress.        
	The figures apparently came from a survey by an NGO with alleged Maoist links. Today, the figures were updated to 60 suicides and 402 heart attacks.        
	Jaganmohan has been accused of receiving dubious investments from Mauritius for his vast business interests, spanning iron ore mining, steel, cement, hydel power, real estate, special economic zones and, allegedly, benami firms.        
	His formation of private army Jagan Yuva Sena last year has annoyed the party, whose suggestion it be merged with the Congress youth or student wing was ignored.

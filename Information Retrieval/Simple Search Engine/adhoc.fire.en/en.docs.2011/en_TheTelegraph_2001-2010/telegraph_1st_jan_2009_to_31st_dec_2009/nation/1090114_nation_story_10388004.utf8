The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Fair-weather friends dump Raju
                                                                                                               Fair-weather friends dump Raju
  - Andhra leaders rush to disown fallen brand ambassador, villagers rally around benefactor        OUR BUREAU                             Naidu, Reddy: Fraud fright                                       
	Hyderabad/New Delhi, Jan. 13: Political parties that till the other day held up Satyam as an Indian icon are competing to distance themselves from the company while accusing opponents of promoting and accepting favours from it.        
	Telugu Desam boss N. Chandrababu Naidu and Congress chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy have been trading salvos since former Satyam chairman B. Ramalinga Raju confessed to cooking the books.        
	Reddy has gleefully displayed newspaper clippings showing Naidu huddled with Ramalinga and cited how the former chief minister had called Raju the brand ambassador of Andhra Pradesh.        
	Naidu made Raju sit close to Bill Clinton while keeping even great industrialists like Ratan Tata away in the crowd during the US Presidents visit to Hyderabad, he said.        
	The Congress also alleges that the former NDA government had ignored tax fraud by the Raju family because Ramalinga was close to then junior foreign minister K. Raju of the BJP. The Congress has been putting out stories that Naidu had invested crores of his personal money in the Satyam Group.        
	The Desam chief says the YSR regime helped the Raju-owned Maytas Infra bag projects worth Rs 30,000 crore in the state and Rs 12,000 crore in places like Noida, Ahmedabad, Mumbai and Bhubaneswar.        
	Let YSR explain how he gave such huge construction projects to Maytas which had a turnover of only Rs 50 crore and no previous experience, Naidu said.        
	The politicians disowning of Raju has been faster if not starker than its mirror image: business leaders embrace of the riot-tainted Narendra Modi  once seen as a threat to Indias brand image  as investor-friendly model chief minister.        
	Even the CPI has jumped into the fray, alleging Maytas was given plots that are benami possessions of YSR. The BJP wants a white paper on Maytas, while Chiranjeevis Praja Rajyam says Satyam had bribed bureaucrats in the chief ministers office with foreign junkets and gifts.        
	The mud-slinging has alarmed the Congress central leadership which believes that unless Satyam is put back on the rails fast, the party may pay a price in the elections. Since Satyam is headquartered in Hyderabad, the scam could tarnish the Congresss only solo government in a major state, one that votes in April.        
	The party, which owed 31 of its 151 Lok Sabha seats in 2004 to Andhra, has lost allies TRS and the Left without gaining new ones. Reddy, therefore, was directed from day one to distance his government from the Satyam owners and crack down on them.        
	Its unfortunate that they surrendered instead of being caught, a Congress MP rued.        
	Congress spokesperson Veerappa Moily today appealed to parties not to play politics over Satyam, reminding them it was once considered the icon of Indian entrepreneurship.        
	He, however, went on to finger Naidu and the BJP: Shareholders were losing money in 2000-01 and the needle of suspicion pointed towards the governments of the day.                    WITH INPUTS FROM RADHIKA RAMASESHAN

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Police fair at Taregna

	Patna, July 21: Curiosity made Evan and Rolly travel from Ireland to New Delhi and then to Patna.        
	Excited by the prospect that they were that much closer to witnessing the total solar eclipse, the couple took a taxi from Patna to Taregna  only to have sub-divisional officer Bindewhar Singh tell them that they must head back. You do not have the official pass (permission) required to stay or even enter the premises of this four-storeyed referral hospital, the SDO said, refusing to oblige the couple.        
	Though the district administration has readied the 75-bed referral hospital at Taregna to facilitate the hordes of tourists and scientists from both India and abroad, red tape rules.         
	I can not allow the Irish couple in for they do not have the pass that is to be issued by the administration, the SDO said, clearly indicating that his hands were tied.        
	The couples argument that they had landed in India with a valid passport and visa was not good enough, either.         
	Back at Patna, Evan and Rolly were spotted walking around the magistrates office trying to secure a valid pass at the time when the report was filed. But, the two are still hopeful. Being so close and yet so far from their Taregna experience has done little to dampen their praise for the village residents.        
	It would be amazing if we succeed. Residents were co-operative. We hope the administration, too, will eventually allow us to watch the event, said Evan.        
	The date for the eclipse coincides with a Maoist bandh call in Bihar, Orissa and some other states of the country. Afraid of the Maoist penchant to strike violently at will, the Bihar administration has deployed four-layers of paramilitary forces and Bihar Military Police jawans around Taregna, which has been a rebel hot bed for long.        
	Today, Taregna, a village 25km south of Patna, resembled a cross between a fair and a police camp with armed security men patrolling the streets, with visitors from far and wide. We are taking full care of the security of scientists and tourists, said Patna superintendent of police R. Mallar Viz.        
	The administration has issued special passes not to trouble anyone, but to ensure fool-proof security and to facilitate the experience of watching the eclipse from either the rooftop of the hospital or from the observatory, said a district administration spokesperson.        
	But Binod Singh, a Taregna resident, argued: If rules are to be this strict then the district magistrate should have set up his camp at Taregna to ensure that visitors do not suffer. It is the duty of the administration to ensure that visitors from Ireland, England and other countries, who are unaware of the procedures are not troubles. Singh appeared to have a point.        
	While scientists and tourists alike are converging at Patna and Taregna to watch the rare event, the Taregna sun temple, too, is ready to greet its share of pilgrims.

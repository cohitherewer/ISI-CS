The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | East to West, busy first day
                                                                                                               East to West, busy first day
          JAYANTH JACOB                              
	New Delhi, May 25: S.M. Krishna had a busy first day in office as the countrys new foreign minister, thanks to North Koreas nuclear test and yesterdays gurdwara violence in Vienna.        
	His first statement in his new post, however, was a congratulatory message to Nepals new Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal, indicating his immediate focus may lie on the neighbourhood.        
	Krishna appeared keen to avoid any misgivings in Kathmandu about an interventionist Delhi, an image of India often milked by the previous Prime Minister, Maoist leader Prachanda.        
	We have a unique relationship with Nepal. We stand ready to support Nepal in any manner it would want us to, the statement said.         
	We hope that the peace process (in Nepal), including the important task of Constitution-drafting, will now move forward expeditiously.        
	The minister, who was briefed by foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon and other senior officials, also interacted with the media. The briefings related to Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Nepal, Austria and North Korea, sources said.        
	Krishna expressed deep concern and regret at yesterdays violence in a Vienna gurdwara, which led to the death of an injured guru today and sparked violence in Punjab.        
	Asked what Indias Vienna mission was doing about it, and also about the Punjab violence, he said: There is no place for violence in a secular society like Indias and certainly no excuse whatsoever for the violation of the sacred premises of a gurdwara for narrow sectarian or other purposes.        
	He added: Our embassy in Vienna is in close contact with the Austrian foreign office, the Viennese police and the Austrian authorities.         
	We are receiving the co-operation of the Austrian authorities and are determined to ensure that the perpetrators of this completely mindless and wanton attack are brought to justice.        
	Krishna also went through reports about Pyongyangs nuclear test and issued a statement that said: For the DPRK (Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea) to conduct such a test in violation of its international commitments would be unfortunate. Like others in the international community, we are concerned at the adverse effect on peace and security in that region of such tests. We continue to monitor the situation.

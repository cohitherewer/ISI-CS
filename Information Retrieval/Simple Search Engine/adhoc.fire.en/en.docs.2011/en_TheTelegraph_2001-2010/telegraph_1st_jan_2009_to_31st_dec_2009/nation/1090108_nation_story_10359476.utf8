The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Oil, gas to get cheaper 
                                                                                                               Oil, gas to get cheaper 
  - Centre mulls Rs 20 cut on cooking gas, Rs 5 on petrol         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Jan. 7: The Centre today said it planned to cut auto fuel and domestic cooking gas prices in two to three weeks.         
	The (auto fuel) price cut is under active consideration. In two to three weeks, a decision will be taken, petroleum minister Murli Deora told reporters. The cut may be as much as the last time, or may be even more, he added.        
	Hinting that domestic LPG cylinders could cost Rs 20-25 less, Deora said housewives would be happy with our decision as they would have to pay less to run kitchens.        
	In December, the government had reduced the price of petrol by Rs 5 a litre and that of diesel by Rs 2 a litre.        
	Sources said the ministry was considering a cut of Rs 5 on a litre of petrol, Rs 2-2.50 on diesel and Rs 20 on a domestic LPG cylinder.         
	It is also thinking of suggesting a cut in excise duty, which would reduce the financial impact of the price reductions on oil companies. The government collects excise duty of Rs 13.35 a litre on unbranded petrol and Rs 3.65 a litre on unbranded diesel.        
	While reducing auto fuel prices last month, Deora had said the price cut was intermediate, indicating that more would follow.        
	Elections are due this summer, with the UPA governments term ending in May.        
	After the price cut in December, the three oil companies  IOC, HPCL and BPCL  are making a profit of Rs 11.99 a litre on petrol and Rs 4.13 a litre on diesel. They however, continue to lose Rs 12.16 on the sale of every litre of kerosene and Rs 132.97 on each domestic LPG cylinder.        
	It is unlikely that the finance ministry would agree to a cut in excise duty as the government has already slashed duties on several products and is burdened with extra budgetary spending.        
	Officials, however, said a cut in excise duty would help the oil companies, which had to suffer huge losses when the global crude prices touched a record high of $145 in July.         
	Now, exploration firms ONGC and OIL have said they are unable to pay their share of the subsidy burden because of falling oil prices.        
	The three oil firms will end the 2008-09 fiscal with over Rs 100,000-crore revenue losses. The Centre has issued nearly Rs 45,000 crore bonds as part-compensation for losses incurred between January and September. The final tranche of Rs 20,000 crore is due in end-January.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Aug. 13: Intelligence agencies have warned that Maoists can selectively target Vishwa Hindu Parishad or Bajrang Dal leaders in Orissa although Janmashtami passed peacefully in the eastern state today.        
	The threat arises out of the Sangh parivars observance of the death anniversary of Swami Laxmanand Saraswati, who was killed on Janmashtami last year, apparently by Maoists.        
	Laxmanand murder in Kandhamal district of Orissa in the last week of August was blamed on Christians and had sparked anti-Christian violence. Security agencies fear that the Hindu radicals observance of the anniversary could also threaten communal harmony in the area.        
	We have specific inputs that there could be attacks on some leaders  a dozen-odd names are on the list of the Maoists, said a home ministry source. The Hindu organisations are observing the anniversary from August 11 to August 17.        
	State police are keeping a watch on the activities of the Orissa State Organising Committee, an offshoot of the CPI(Maoist).

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Karuna pens a Tamil bond
                                                                                                               Karuna pens a Tamil bond
          G.C. SHEKHAR                              
	Chennai, Oct. 21: The master of dialogue has scripted a language bond.        
	A world Tamil conference being held by the DMK government next year has opened the door for the CPM, CPI and the PMK to cosy up to the ruling party after parting ways before the 2009 Lok Sabha polls.        
	The two Left parties have responded enthusiastically to chief minister M. Karunanidhis invitation to be part of the various organising committees, indicating they are not averse to rejoining the DMK bandwagon.        
	The PMK will communicate its formal decision later this week. We have no problems being part of the exercise since the conference is aimed at promoting the Tamil language, said a leader of the PMK, which recently snapped ties with Jayalalithaas ADMK.        
	Karunanidhi  whose contribution to Tamil literature includes screenplays, novels and dialogues  had invited all parties, including arch-rival ADMK, to join hands and make the June 2010 World Classical Tamil Conference in Coimbatore a success.        
	But Jayalalithaa rejected the invite, saying the meet didnt have the official stamp of a World Tamil Conference since it had not been convened by the International Association of Tamil Research. The IATR had convened eight of the preceding conferences.        
	Karunanidhi, 85, had announced last month that the conference would be held this December but the IATRs head, Neboru Karoshima, a Japanese Tamil scholar, wanted at least a years notice. Karunanidhi then suggested that the conference be held in June 2010, but Karoshima preferred January 2011.        
	The DMK chief argued that the month suggested by Karoshima would not be practicable as all parties would be in election mode for the 2011 Assembly polls. But the Japanese scholar stuck to January 2011 and refused to give the conference the IATRs official status.        
	The chief minister then, with the support of other Tamil scholars, many of them part of the IATR, declared that the Coimbatore meet would be called the World Classical Tamil Conference as it was being held after Tamil had been given classical status by the Centre.        
	Karunanidhis main intention is to use the conference to repair his reputation among the world Tamil community after tripping badly on the Lankan Tamil issue, and also as a launch pad for his governments re-election campaign. The response from the three former allies fits into the larger picture.

          NASIR JAFFRY                                                  
	Islamabad, June 2: A Pakistani court today freed Lashkar-e-Toiba founder Hafiz Mohammad Saeed after six months of house arrest, prompting India to accuse its neighbour of not being serious about bringing the masterminds of the Mumbai attacks to justice.        
	Pakistani authorities said they planned to move a higher court against the order to release the chief of the Jamaat-ud-Dawa, a charity the UN called a front for the Lashkar, the banned militant outfit blamed for the November strikes.        
	The Punjab government has the option of filing an appeal in the high court itself or the Supreme Court later.        
	Saeeds lawyer emerged from the courthouse to say that the judges had decided that Saeeds house arrest was against the law and Constitution of the country.        
	Saeeds supporters shouted God is great as the 59-year-old cleric  put under house arrest in December after a Security Council committee added him and the charity he heads to a list of people and organisations linked to al Qaida or the Taliban  stepped out.        
	With him was close aide Nazir Ahmed, a retired colonel who, too, was freed from detention by the three-judge bench.        
	In its brief order, the bench said the court accepts the petition of Hafiz Mohammad Saeed and Col (Retd) Nazir Ahmed against their detention, which is illegal. The court orders their immediate release.         
	A detailed order citing reasons for the release will be pronounced later. Lawyers in Pakistan said that in similar cases where suspects had been released, lack of evidence was the decisive factor.         
	Saaed is accused Number One in the chargesheet filed in a special court by Mumbai police and his name figures repeatedly in a confession made by the lone captured terrorist, Ajmal Kasab. The chargesheet said Saeed was among the 35 who aided and abetted the Mumbai attacks that killed nearly 170 people.        
	India has handed over a dossier, apparently refurbished with evidence also supplied by American investigators, to Pakistan on Saeed but it is not clear how concrete the evidence is.        
	A defiant Saeed told a news conference at a mosque near his home that Kasab had no connection with his outfit and that he and his associates had been detained under Indian pressure.        
	Ajmal Kasab has no connection with the JuD, he said, and vowed to continue his struggle against what he called the occupation of Jammu and Kashmir.        
	His spokesman, Khalid Saeed, said the Dawa would challenge the freeze of its assets in court.        
	Analysts in Pakistan said the high court order was a clear message to the international community that the judiciary was free in Pakistan. But it might not augur well for Islamabads already strained relations with Delhi, analyst Shafqat Mehmood said.        
	The ruling comes at a time Washington would prefer that Pakistan focus on dislodging Taliban militants in the border area with Afghanistan  rather than its rivalry with India.        
	Richard Holbrooke, President Barack Obamas special envoy to Pakistan and Afghanistan, is due in Islamabad tomorrow.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lalgarh plea from Mamata
                                                                                                               Lalgarh plea from Mamata
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Mamata at an all-party meeting at Parliament. (PTI)                                   
	New Delhi, July 1: Mamata Banerjee has written to the Prime Minister urging him to suspend security operations against Maoists in Lalgarh being jointly conducted by the Centre and the Bengal government, alleging that state forces were harassing innocent locals.         
	The Trinamul Congress chief also asked finance minister Pranab Mukherjee to convene a meeting with home minister P. Chidambaram, where she plans to complain about atrocities on Lalgarh tribals, sources close to Mamata said.         
	Mamata has earlier, too, demanded a halt to the Lalgarh operations, but her note to the Prime Minister suggests she plans to up the ante on the demand.         
	The note reflects a desperation  to end the Lalgarh operation  born out of Trinamuls fears that the participation of central forces in the siege could hurt her pro-people image, party sources said.         
	Although the note is aimed at articulating Trinamuls concerns, its timing also reflects the bind Mamata finds herself in over the partys relationship with the Congress.         
	Major offensive operations in many parts of the troubled zone are either over or are likely to be over soon. Even if the Centre does act on her demand, the move would be symbolic at best, a source said.         
	By pressing for the end of central participation in Lalgarh, we are trying to articulate that we are not party to the action by security forces there, a Trinamul leader said.         
	The Trinamul, the chief Opposition party in Bengal, believes it needs the support of the Congress to topple the Left regime in the state, even though it is uncomfortable with the Lalgarh operations.         
	The Trinamul and the Congress together won in 10 of 16 state municipalities that went to polls while the Left won three civic bodies. The results were announced today.         
	I attribute the performance to the people of Bengal, to maa-mati-manush, Mamata beamed, reacting to the results. The CPM, she said, should draw a lesson from this verdict and step down from power.         
	Despite their terror, the people have once again supported us within one-and-a-half months of the Lok Sabha poll, she told a Bengali television channel.

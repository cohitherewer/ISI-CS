          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                               
	Lucknow, Feb. 3: Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh today knocked on the doors of Islamic seminary Dar-ul Uloom, worried that teaming up with Kalyan Singh has angered Muslim leaders.        
	But senior ulemas at the institution in Saharanpur, 450km from Lucknow, refused to meet Amar, who was accompanied by party MP Rashid Masud. The Dar-ul Uloom is a non-political, academic institution, they were told.         
	The Samajwadi leader then decided to approach the Dar-ul Waqf, a sister organisation, where he faced angry questions on how his party had joined hands with the face of the Babri Masjid demolition.        
	Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, who held a meeting with ulemas in Lucknow, later said: It was not my day.        
	Around 1.30pm, Amar was trying to explain his stand to senior cleric Maulana Sufian Quereshi in the library of the Waqf. Quereshi told him to instead address the students who were gathered there.         
	Mohsin Mustak, a student, asked: How do you explain friendship with Kalyan Singh, an accused in the Babri demolition case?         
	Amar replied: He is the enemy of our enemy. Hence he is our friend.         
	The counter-question was quick: So there is no role for ideology in your party?         
	There is ideology but every party has its own strategy, Amar said.

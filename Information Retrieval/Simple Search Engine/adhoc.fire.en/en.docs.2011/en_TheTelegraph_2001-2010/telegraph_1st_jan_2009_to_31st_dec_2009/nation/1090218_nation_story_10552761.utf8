          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 17: Lawyers across the country will strike work tomorrow to protest changes in the Criminal Procedure Code which they fear will marginalise them.        
	The CrPC (Amendment) Bill, introduced in the Rajya Sabha in August 2006, proposes to disallow adjournments only on the ground that the lawyer handling a case is busy with another.         
	This is permissible under existing laws, though analysts have blamed repeated adjournments for delays plaguing the system.         
	The lawyers are also objecting to an amendment which will empower a judge to cross-examine a witness without going through a lawyer, a change they fear will adversely affect their business.         
	Delhi High Court Bar Association secretary D.K. Sharma said the changes had been passed without consultation with the legal fraternity.        
	Besides, he added, the new laws give unfettered power to police, including the discretion to arrest a suspect accused of offences that carry a jail term of up to seven years. This will lead to corruption and arbitrariness. Sharma said Delhi High Court lawyers would sit on hunger strike outside the court complex.         
	Rajiv Khosla, spokesperson for the striking lawyers co-ordination committee, said the amendments will give a boost to criminals as a mandatory provision of arrest had been taken away.

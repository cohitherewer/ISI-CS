The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sibal faces Big Two quiz on school bill 
                                                                                                               Sibal faces Big Two quiz on school bill 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Sonia Gandhi                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 3: Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh today quizzed human resource development minister Kapil Sibal, concerned about a growing clamour for changes to the right to education bill under discussion in the Lok Sabha.         
	Sources in the HRD ministry however claimed the minister had succeeded in convincing the Congress president that most of the concerns raised by educationists and disability rights groups were exaggerated.         
	It is unclear whether the concerns raised by the Prime Minister have been assuaged.         
	The government, desperate to ensure that the bill is passed without delay, is learnt to have asked V. Narayansamy, junior parliamentary affairs minister, to squeeze its discussion into tomorrows House proceedings.         
	The bill will be passed without any changes, a senior official said.         
	Educationists have criticised the current draft of the bill for lacking teeth to punish those who violate it, accusing the government of leaving loopholes that may allow escape routes for those who infringe the proposed law.         
	Minority groups have questioned the absence of any exemption for minority schools from regulations on admission policy prescribed under the bill.         
	These groups have argued that under Article 30 of the Indian Constitution, they should be exempted from these government regulations  including a 25 per cent quota for economically weaker students.         
	But it is a spate of protests over the past week by disabled rights groups across the country that may have triggered the expression of concerns by Sonia and Singh.         
	These groups have held protests against the proposed bill in several major cities and yesterday met Sibal.         
	Today, they were informed  in the middle of an indefinite hunger strike  that the Prime Minister wanted to meet them.         
	The PM assured us that our concerns will be addressed, said Javed Abidi, head of the disability rights group that has been spearheading the protest along with the Spactics Society of India.         
	They raised three concerns with the current draft of the bill, when they met Singh and Sibal, government sources said.         
	The disabled rights activists argued that the bill effectively extends benefits only to those with physical disabilities  not children with cerebral palsy or autism.         
	The definition of disadvantaged children  for whom each private school is required to reserve 25 per cent seats  does not include the differently abled.         
	Finally, they argued, the bill does not mention special schools with barrier-free entry for differently abled children.         
	The Lok Sabha, we learnt while growing up, is the House of the People. All we want is that the concerns of the people are reflected in what happens in the House tomorrow, Abidi said. Sibal, when he met Sonia, is however learnt to have argued that both cerebral palsy and autism are covered under the bill, which includes in its ambit children covered under the disabilities act of 1995.         
	Disability, under the 1995 act, includes locomotor disability, which is defined in a manner that includes cerebral palsy.         
	Autism, he told Sonia was not explicitly covered by the disability act but could be considered a mental illness  which is covered under that act.         
	In any case, he argued, model rules  for states to adopt  accompanying the right to education act could be drafted to specifically include autism and cerebral palsy.         
	The disability act is also being amended, and can be altered to specifically cover autism  automatically guaranteeing that the condition is covered under the right to education act, Sibal is learnt to have argued.         
	Changing the definition of disadvanted children was not needed as each state would eventually have the right to define this group and could include  or not include  the disadvantaged.         
	The bill, by granting statutory recognition to the right of disabled children to education, incorporates the need for special schools, Sibal is learnt to have argued.         
	Once passed by the Lok Sabha, the bill becomes a law enforcable from the day it is notified.         
	The government, however, is yet to finalise funding norms for the implementation of the proposed law.         
	The right to education would effectively become implementable only when the funding is clear and is released. Till then, it will remain a law only on paper, a senior HRD ministry official said.         
	The ministry has asked the finance commission to finalise funding norms for the proposed law.

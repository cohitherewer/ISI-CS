          CITHARA PAUL                                    
	New Delhi, March 2: The Centre is planning a website to help the unemployed get the security of public-sector jobs, the move coming at a time of rising private sector layoffs.        
	We are planning a portal on the lines of popular job websites like naukri.com and monster.com. It would be of great assistance to the youth registered with employment exchanges to know about vacancies in the public sector, a labour ministry official said.        
	Bengal has the largest number of job-seekers registered with the exchanges at 75 lakh, in a total of over 4 crore, the ministry said. It is followed by Maharashtra (42 lakh), Kerala (41 lakh) and Tamil Nadu (39 lakh).        
	The exchanges provide information on government and public sector jobs, always coveted but more so in turbulent times. Recession has taken the sheen off the private sector. Now more people are registering with exchanges. This could lead to a scramble for jobs. Our attempt is to make the process more user-friendly, the ministry official said.        
	Over five lakh private-sector jobs were lost in the last three months of 2008 because of the impact of the global downturn. Ministry sources said employment exchanges had seen a sharp rise in registrations last year, especially in the last quarter when the layoffs occurred. Around 70 lakh registrations took place last year.         
	The Centre had been thinking of a portal for some time but the job losses speeded up the plan, the official said.        
	The website will be linked to the 1,000-odd exchanges, whose data will be collated at the national level and fed into the portal. Central ministries and states will be asked to send details of vacancies to the labour ministry so the data can be put on the site. The figures will be updated every three months.

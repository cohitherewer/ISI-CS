The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sibal clips AICTE wings
                                                                                                               Sibal clips AICTE wings
  - Corruption allegations cost council inspection power         CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           Sibal                                        
	New Delhi, July 24: Education minister Kapil Sibal has stripped the All India Council for Technical Education of the power to inspect institutions before they can increase student intake.        
	The move comes as a fresh humiliation for the body already under the CBI scanner for corruption.         
	The human resource development minister has ordered that recognised technical institutions can expand on their own, conditional on future inspections, clipping the councils wings after accusations that delays in granting expansion were a ruse to aid corruption, The Telegraph has learnt.        
	Sibals order comes in synchrony with his decision to allow the CBI to probe senior AICTE officials.         
	All Indian technical institutions, barring the IIMs and institutes like the IITs set up under acts of Parliament, need their courses to be approved by the AICTE.         
	Till now, an institution had to obtain AICTE approval  granted after an inspection  before they could expand any course.         
	With Sibals order, institutions can expand conditionally after simply submitting an application for increasing intake. The council inspection team can visit later and, based on its report, the institution will either be allowed to retain its expanded strength or ordered to reduce to pre-expansion levels.         
	The idea, HRD ministry officials said, is to ensure that good quality institutions do not any longer have to suffer delays by the council while implementing expansion plans.         
	A source clarified that the move in no way seeks to end the process of on-campus inspections by the council.         
	The inspections are still mandatory, but good institutions will not need to wait endlessly till the AICTE team visits.         
	Sibals order will not make expansion easier for poor quality institutions, the official argued.         
	Since the inspection is still mandatory, an institution can be ordered to return to its strength before expansion. This would mean a waste of the institutions resources spent on the expansion. So, only institutions confident of approval will expand, the official said.         
	The move follows a series of complaints from institutions that AICTE officials would hold their expansion plans to ransom, demanding corruption money in exchange for quick sanction.         
	AICTE member secretary K. Narayana Rao was arrested last Thursday by the CBI following a complaint from a Hyderabad-based technical education group that he had demanded a bribe.         
	The CBI is also investigating complaints against AICTE chairman Ram Avtar Yadav, and has raided his house.        
	The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), in its report tabled in Parliament today, also accused the AICTE of violating norms in approving travel grants to researchers and faculty for international conferences.

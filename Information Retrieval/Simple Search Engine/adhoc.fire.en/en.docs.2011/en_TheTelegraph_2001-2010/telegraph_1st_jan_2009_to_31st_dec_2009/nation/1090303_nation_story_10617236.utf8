The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lanka digs up Vaiko in Tiger uniform 
                                                                                                               Lanka digs up Vaiko in Tiger uniform 
                                Prabhakaran (top), Vaiko                           
	Colombo/Tirunelveli, March 2 (PTI): The Sri Lankan Army today released photographs of MDMK chief Vaiko with LTTE boss V. Prabhakaran, but the Tamil Nadu politician dismissed them as old pictures made public with an ulterior motive.        
	The Lankan defence ministry said photographs of certain South Indian politicians in LTTE camps in Wanni, including Vaiko, were found yesterday at the rebel satellite communication centre in Puthukudiruppu West.        
	The army said Vaiko had been photographed in Tamil Tiger uniform, firing pistols with Prabhakaran and delivering brain-washing lectures to the LTTE cadres.        
	These photographs reveal that the plans for a greater Tamil Eeelam had been already on the way, the defence minister quoted an analyst as saying.         
	Vaiko, known for his strident pro-LTTE stand, was dismissive. These are old photos. The Sri Lankan government has released them with an ulterior motive. Anyhow, I am proud of the photos. If I get an opportunity, I will again visit Wanni, he said.        
	Vaiko, who undertook a clandestine trip to Jaffna in 1989 when he was a DMK Rajya Sabha member, also denied he was receiving funds from the Tamil Tigers.         
	Vaiko was freed on bail from a Tirunelveli jail where he had been held since his arrest for attempting to show black flags to foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee on Saturday.

                                                                                                               Young amp; old cheer Congress, lone man turns out for BJP
  - I always knew we were winning, says 10-year-old supporter at 10 janpath          ANANYA SENGUPTA                          Congress workers celebrate outside Sonia Gandhis residence in Delhi on Saturday. Picture by Prem Singh                                         
	New Delhi, May 16: A solitary man sporting orange overalls and long beard was the only BJP supporter present at the party headquarters at 12pm, just four hours after counting began.        
	The man, who claimed to be a seer, seemed to have understood like his party leaders that even divine intervention couldnt help the BJP now  his bowed head, and the look of frustration on his face, so early on counting day, was symptomatic of the things to come.        
	It took only four hours for L.K. Advani to realise he would perhaps never be Prime Minister, and Manmohan Singh to know he would have a second term.         
	All roads in the capital today seemed to lead to 10 Janpath as celebrations of party workers spilled onto the roads. Police barricaded the road to the Congress chiefs house. Bursting firecrackers, holding posters of Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, party supporters, both young and old, couldnt hold back their glee.        
	I always knew we were winning. Thats why I was here since 9 in the morning to celebrate. I think Rahul Gandhi won this one for us, said 10-year-old Ajay Singh, a supporter who seemed to know a lot about the electoral process and the history of his party.        
	It was as early as 9.30am when the partys New Delhi candidate, Ajay Maken, announced he had won the first round by 18,843 votes. Makens counting centre was adjacent to the CPM headquarters.         
	The moment the Congressman won, his supporters started celebrating outside the Lefts office, complete with beating drums and firecrackers  the CPM party members, having lost ground in both Bengal and Kerala, preferred to stay inside.

	At the BJP headquarters, at 11 Ashoka Road, just a few senior leaders like Prakash Javadekar, Balbir Punj and Najma Heptullah, were holding fort.        
	While the Congress workers set up a hawan with Rahuls picture, the BJP workers stayed at home.        
	Ab BJP wale bahar aake kya karenge, unki sari umeedien dhool mein mit gayee hai (What will the BJP do coming out of their homes, all their hopes have turned to dust), said Rita Ray, a 35-year-old Congress supporter.         
	Drummers booked by Congress workers earned big bucks, while BJP workers didnt even get back to the ones they had booked.        
	I was praying for a BJP victory, but now I will have to go home without any income. I wish I had been approached by a Congressman, said Rahul Singh, a drummer booked by the BJP.        
	It was also a contrasting day at work for police personnel stationed at the headquarters of the two national parties. With the BJP office wearing a deserted look, cops had no crowds to manage. Most of them chose to catch a nap.

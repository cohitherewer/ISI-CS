The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Few takers for tour buses
                                                                                                               Few takers for tour buses
          PRIYA ABRAHAM                          Doomed?                                  
	Bhubaneswar, May 29: They had won the Most Innovative Tourism Product award offered by the Union tourism ministry in February 2009 for the unique hop on-hop off bus services for tourists.        
	Today, the buses, launched by the Orissa Tourism Development Corporation, and run by a private operator, took to Bhubaneswar roads minus the tourists.        
	Seven out of the 11 air-conditioned buses have been staying put, while four other buses move about with hardly 25 tourists a day.        
	We have been running at a heavy loss ever since the launch. Its a loss of at least Rs 1.5 lakh every month even after running only four buses, said Subash Chhotray, the chief co-ordinator of Kalinga Trade and Travels  the private operator running the service.        
	It is not that we cannot run the rest (of the buses); we will if there are demands, he added.        
	Eleven air-conditioned buses were flagged off at Bhubaneswar on August 4, 2008. The idea was to develop a network of bus service connecting the important tourist sites within the city. The buses with a guide were to ply on two routes - a city one and a heritage route  enabling tourists to access the best of Bhubaneswar.        
	Despite a nominal cost of Rs 250 per day, lack of awareness and absence of scheduled buses at stops has led to a breakdown of this project that is the first-of-its-kind in India. OTDC officials said the response was as expected.        
	The response was poor in August when we had just started but by November it was doing an average business, said OTDC divisional manager U.K. Pati, adding that they get around 30 tourists everyday.        
	Hoping that the service would pick up in the long run, Pati adds that things will change when the tourists mindset changes.         
	Most of the tourists who avail the services are from foreign shores. The tickets are available at hotels, railway stations, airports and in Panthanivases, said Chhotray.        
	The last and perhaps the only large consignment of tourists that the buses carried was when the Indian Association of Tour Operators conference was held at Bhubaneswar. For four days all the buses were pressed into service taking the 1,000 delegates around the city.        
	The maximum number of tickets are usually sold from the railway station counters. Hotels are not co-operating as we expected, alleged Pati.         
	Despite the losses, states including Kerala, Karnataka and Punjab are mulling a plan to introduce similar services. Chennai has already begun its service with just four buses, said OTDC officials.        
	Meanwhile, the tourism department claims to have done its bit in carrying out a publicity campaign. We had done a huge publicity about the project at the Nalban Festival in Calcutta and a tourism related festival at IIT, Kharagpur, said Pati.         
	Despite losses, the tourism department is hopeful about the project. This time round, the officials have been planning to introduce the service at Puri. The buses, it is being planned, will run from Jagannath temple to the sea beach and vice versa.

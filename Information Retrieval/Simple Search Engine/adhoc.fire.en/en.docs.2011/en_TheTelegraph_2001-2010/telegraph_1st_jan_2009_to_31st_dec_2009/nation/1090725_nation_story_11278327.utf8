                                                                                                               Panel seeks strip report
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, July 24: The National Commission for Women today sought a government report on the alleged incident in which a woman was stripped in public yesterday evening.         
	Taking the commissions cue, chief minister Nitish Kumar today directed the Bihar director-general of police D.N. Gautam to probe into the incident.         
	A 22-year-old woman (name withheld), supposedly a resident of Jasidih in Jharkhand, allegedly checked into a Patna hotel with one Rakesh.         
	According to the police, late in the evening hotel staff reportedly heard Rakesh and the young woman quarrel over money. Then the woman picked up Rakeshs mobile phone and ran into the streets with him chasing her.         
	Eventually Rakesh caught up with her, and angered by her move, tried to strip her in public. Subsequently, a group of residents attacked Rakesh and eventually handed him over to the Gandhi Maidan police.        
	Talking to reporters today, the additional director-general of police (headquarters), Neelmani, said that two officers of Gandhi Maidan police station were suspended after the incident.         
	The police, added Neelmani, have arrested the hotel owner and two staff for allowing what seemed to be soliciting and prostitution in their hotel.         
	The matter took a political turn today with Opposition parties such as the RJD and others staged demonstrations on the streets of Patna against the outrage. There were protests held outside the Assembly, while RJD boss Lalu Prasad slammed Nitish Kumar.        
	The womens commission, on the other hand, demanded that the chief minister ensure that such incidents were not repeated in the state. Commission chairperson Girija Vyas said she was shocked by the television footage of the incident.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Poll talk at health function
                                                                                                               Poll talk at health function
          NALIN VERMA                                     
	Patna, Feb. 19: They promised not to talk politics, but when Amar Singh, Sanjay Dutt and Shatrughan Sinha connect, can politics be far behind?         
	Though the two veterans and the novice (Sanjay Dutt) gathered at Patnas Mahavir Cancer Research Institute to inaugurate a centre for alternative cancer medicine and to initiate an anti-tobacco drive, only Sanju Baba delivered a few lines on the disease.        
	However, Samajvadi Party general secretary Amar Singh and actor-turned-BJP leader Shatrughan Sinha chose to use words with political overtones, adding colour and twists to pre-poll politics.         
	At todays function Munna Bhai looked more the film star in his kurta and denims. The star spoke on how he and his late father Sunil Dutt had battled cancer that claimed both his mother and his first wife.         
	Though Shatruji belongs to a communal party, he is above party politics and works for social and humanitarian causes with zeal and zest. Shatruji joined Sunil Dutt in waging a battle against cancer. I am fond of him, said Amar Singh.        
	Shatruji believes in ekla chalo theory of Rabindranath Tagore and I remember him lip syncing to the song, said Amar Singh.        
	But soon giving up his indirect political salvos, Amar launched into direct attack. L.K. Advani and A.B. Vajpayee should make their stands clear on the Ram temple issue, he stressed.        
	That was followed by a spate of fulsome praise of Shotgun, who has declared himself as the BJP candidate for the Patna Saheb seat, antagonising BJP leaders and cadre.         
	And what did the actor have to say about the comments? I had asked my friend Amar Singh to not comment against Advaniji, while sharing a dais with me. He has refrained from doing so. It is a health-related function and we have not gathered here to discuss politics, said the actor, calmly. But, BJP veteran R.K. Sinha, also a claimant to the Patna saheb seat, disagreed.        
	We are not opposed to our leaders joining other party leaders for a social cause. But, Shatrughan Sinha shared a platform with a leader of a diametrically opposite party on the eve of Lok Sabha polls, sending off wrong signals.        
	Its tantamount to blackmailing the party for a ticket, Sinha added.         
	In fact, there is a strong feeling in a section of the BJP that Shotgun is trying to pressurise the BJP high command to either declare his candidature or to let him go the Samajwadi way.

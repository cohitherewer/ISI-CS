The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Maya free gifts find no takers
                                                                                                               Maya free gifts find no takers
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                          Mayavati: Flop show                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 7: Mayavati may be wondering why some of Uttar Pradeshs poorest seem more eager to offer free hospitality than accept it.        
	As Rahul Gandhi continues to be an uninvited guest at the homes of heartland farmers, 1,000 flats that Mayavati wants to gift free of cost to the poor are going empty because there are no takers.        
	In June 2008, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister had announced she would build one lakh flats for the poor across the state in the first phase of the Kanshi Ram Shahri Garib Aawas Yojana.        
	A year on, the houses are ready but no applications from the poor have been received for the 1,000 flats built in Noida and Greater Noida, the industrial hubs on Delhis outskirts, officials said.        
	A harried Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA), which has to submit a completion report to the state government by August 15, has twice extended the last date for application but to no avail.        
	Sources in the urban development ministry, the nodal agency for the scheme, said the reason was that the area had no permanent urban poor.        
	The problem is, Noida and Greater Noida have mainly a shifting population of the poor  labourers who come looking for work and keep moving from one construction site to another, living in makeshift jhuggis (shanties), an official said.        
	Applicants for the houses are required to attach their BPL (below poverty line) certificate with their application form, but these day labourers dont even have ration cards. Even beneficiaries like homeless widows need to furnish documents, which they dont have.        
	Each of the 35sqm flats has two bedrooms, a kitchen and a bathroom, and cost Rs 1.75 lakh to build. According to the Uttar Pradesh government, 23 per cent of the flats are reserved for Dalits and the Scheduled Tribes, 27 per cent for the Other Backward Classes and the rest for the general category. The allotment is disabled-friendly  they are to be given only ground-floor flats.        
	GNIDA officials said the district magistrates had been given the responsibility for receiving applications and allotting the flats, so they are to be held accountable if the flats go empty.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hugo to Bush, PM uses right quote at right time 
                                                                                                               Hugo to Bush, PM uses right quote at right time 
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                                             
	New Delhi, July 31: The good-hearted joke is that a copy of the bulky New Penguin Dictionary of Modern Quotations must lie somewhere close to where Prime Minister Manmohan Singh puts final touches to his critical speeches.         
	He may lack the knack for extempore oratory but he appears to have a flair for locating just the right words to fire the articulation of his pursuits  Wednesdays performance in the Lok Sabha, which left a bellicose Opposition fairly tamed, was proof.         
	From Victor Hugo and Thomas Carlyle, Arthur Pigou and Winston Churchill to the relatively less intellectually fancied Ronald Reagan and George Bush Jr., Singh has quoted them all to validate his chosen agendas over the years. It is widely agreed he has employed them well, sometimes too well.         
	It is quite likely that more among us attribute the famed idea whose time has come line to Singhs defence of economic reforms than to Hugo, its original author.         
	And it is a fair estimate that trust but verify too will become inalienably attached to Singh in the years to come, although the Prime Minister himself credited the phrase to Reagan, who, in turn, may have borrowed it from Felix Dzerzhinsky, founder of Cheka, the Soviet secret police.         
	But two things can be said with some certainty about the Prime Ministers choice of quotes: he casts his net higher than the rest of the field  Bollywood and its lyrics industry is popular among politicians but too lowbrow for Singh  and his key criterion is that lines he picks must become props to his theme.         
	Theres a third thing that can be said of his choices with even greater authority  he makes them all himself.         
	Nobody needs to testify that Singh is probably Indias best read Prime Minister since Jawaharlal Nehru; a key aide said his knowledge pool is a subject of daily invocation.         
	He is obviously extremely well and eclectically read, the thing is he is also constantly thinking ideas rather than individuals, which is rare in a politician. It is almost as if he deliberately wants to skim a layer above the rest when it comes to levels of thinking.         
	Its only been the rare occasion that the Prime Minister has felt ribbed roughly enough to be provoked into personal retort, but those occasions have been rare.         
	Leader of Opposition and pretender to his office L.K. Advani proffered one such with his constant refrain that Singh was kamzor and nikamma (weak and worthless).         
	During the motion of confidence debate last July, Singh revealed an atypically belligerent bone that he wielded quite fiercely on his bete noire: The leader of Opposition, Shri L.K. Advani, has chosen to use all manner of abusive adjectives to describe my performance. He has described me as the weakest Prime Minister, a nikamma PM, he protested. To fulfil his ambitions, he has made at least three attempts to topple our government. But on each occasion his astrologers have misled him. This pattern, I am sure, will be repeated today. At his ripe old age, I do not expect Shri Advani to change his thinking. But for his sake and Indias sake, I urge him at least to change his astrologers so that he gets more accurate predictions of things to come.         
	It was one of those rare speeches in which Singh sought no crutch of borrowed quote, it seemed to come from within, all his own midnight-oil work, we are reliably told.         
	The political content to the Prime Ministers speeches is all his own, and yesterdays was one of the finest he made said Sanjaya Baru, former media adviser to Singh who is about to end a teaching sabbatical in Singapore. I can tell you that the references to Reagan and Atal Bihari Vajpayee are absolutely his personal touch.         
	A top current aide offered clues to why Singh may have laboured a little more than usual on his latest Lok Sabha speech  its about love.         
	He is a bit of a legacy seeker. The economic reforms, the nuclear deal. Pakistan is the other issue. Achieving a breakthrough with Pakistan was the unfinished agenda of his first term in office, he said. The Prime Minister has often spoken of his determination to achieve a lasting peace with Pakistan and he is telling the nation that he will give it his best shot without compromising national interests. And to that extent, his speech was very much his own handiwork, his deep voice.         
	Most speeches Singh makes float up to his table through complex layers of filtration and annotation. Senior officials of the ministry concerned  in this case it would have been external affairs  usually frame a broad policy draft which is put up to the PMO, where it is vetted again, among others by the media adviser. But the final work is the Prime Ministers own.         
	Very often, he makes substantive changes and he almost always has things to add, a senior PMO official said. The Prime Ministers speech in the end is his own, it is not fair for anyone else to claim credit for it.         
	What credit is due to others  from Hugo to Bush  Singh is careful to apportion himself. If that dictionary does sit somewhere near it, it must be well flagged.

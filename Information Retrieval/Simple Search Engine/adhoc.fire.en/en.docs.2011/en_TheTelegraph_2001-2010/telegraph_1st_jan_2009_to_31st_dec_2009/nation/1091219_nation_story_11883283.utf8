	New Delhi, Dec. 18: The Supreme Court collegium will write to the government to keep Karnataka Chief Justice P.D. Dinakarans proposed elevation to the apex court in abeyance, Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan said today.        
	When an impeachment motion is pending against him, theres no question of bringing him to the Supreme Court at this stage, he said.        
	The CJI appeared to suggest the apex court collegium, which appoints judges, would wait for the outcome of the impeachment proceedings initiated against Justice Dinakaran in the Rajya Sabha.        
	Members of the bar have accused the judge of financial impropriety and judicial misconduct. Activists have circulated a motion of impeachment against him, collecting the signatures of more than 75 Rajya Sabha members.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Education rating term

          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 9: Private rating agencies will need government sanction to change their ownership structure if they want to participate in Indias proposed new higher education accreditation regime  a condition officials admit may prove a major deterrent.        
	The new accreditation system is ostensibly aimed at ending direct government role in rating institutions and courses. However, it imposes controversial controls over ownership patterns of private firms that wish to participate, The Telegraph has learnt.        
	The draft bill to create an overarching government regulator of rating agencies bars accreditation firms from changing the ownership structure laid down in their Memorandum of Association (MoA) without approval from the regulator.        
	A private rating agency like Crisil, for instance, would need approval from the proposed regulator to change its MoA or risk losing its licence to accredit higher educational institutions.        
	Human resource development ministry sources admitted that this condition may deter many private rating agencies from signing up to accredit higher educational institutions.        
	But they said the clause is essential to prevent a licensed rating firm from altering its ownership structure in a manner that may comprise a conflict of interest.        
	We cannot allow an accreditation firm to have among its owners someone with links to an institution the firm may accredit. The clause is crucial to prevent any conflict of interest scenario from arising, a senior official explained.        
	The draft bill to create the new regulator  called the National Authority for Regulation in Accreditation of Higher Educational Institutions  also empowers it to charge a penalty of Rs 1 lakh for any contravention of norms.        
	Announcing his 100-day agenda in June, HRD minister Kapil Sibal had said the new national authority would be an independent accreditation regulator.         
	At present, only the National Accreditation and Assessment Council and the National Board of Accreditation  both government agencies  are allowed to rate higher educational institutions.        
	But unlike the National Commission for Higher Education and Research which will replace multiple regulators governing different streams of higher education, the new accreditation watchdog will not be picked by constitutional authorities like the Prime Minister.        
	As reported by The Telegraph on July 30, an HRD ministry-appointed panel may select the accreditation regulator instead.        
	The new accreditation watchdog, apart from registering agencies that will be allowed to rate institutions, will have the task of prescribing accreditation norms that must be followed by the rating agencies.         
	The watchdog will also draft a separate code of ethics binding on all licensed rating agencies.        
	Licences can be revoked if the rating agency breaks norms and standards, or is financially unable fully and efficiently to discharge its duties, the draft bill states.

	New Delhi, Aug. 6: A 20-year-old would-be model and actor has been arrested for allegedly murdering his girlfriend, an IT professional, after she refused to finance his portfolio.        
	Himanshu Jetly had recently completed a training course for aspiring models but did not have the money to prepare a portfolio  a collection of his pictures in various poses that would have helped him bag assignments, police said.        
	Making a decent portfolio can cost Rs 50,000 or more. Jetly would have needed to buy branded clothes and maybe accessories for the pictures, rent a studio, and pay for make-up and styling.        
	Jetly was in need of money to support his lavish lifestyle and get a portfolio prepared, deputy commissioner of police Shalini Singh said.        
	Veerpal Kaur Gill, 24, who was from Punjab and was a project manager with an IT firm in Delhi, was found dead in her rented room in south Delhi on July 30, two days after her murder. The landlord had complained about a stench.        
	Jetly, who is from Ludhiana in Punjab, was arrested in Delhi yesterday on a tip-off. According to police sources, he told them that when Gill refused him money, there was a violent quarrel and Jetly picked up an iron pipe lying nearby and beat her. A fearful Gill then handed over her ATM card and revealed the PIN number.        
	Jetly, fearing she might inform the police, bludgeoned her to death. He left with her ATM card, laptop and iPod after locking the doors of the room and the entrance to the fourth floor. He later withdrew a large sum using her ATM card.        
	The police got their first clue from Gills friends who said Jetly had visited her on July 28 to return a SIM card, and that he had borrowed money from her. We found out that since that day, no one had seen Gill or Jetly, DCP Singh said.        
	A police team went to Ludhiana but Jetlys entire family was missing. Investigations revealed Jetly had met a friend on July 30 and handed over a laptop, on the pretext of getting it repaired, as well as an iPod and some documents.

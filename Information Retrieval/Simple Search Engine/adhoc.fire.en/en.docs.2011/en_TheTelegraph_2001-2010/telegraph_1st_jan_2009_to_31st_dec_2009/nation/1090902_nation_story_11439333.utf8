          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      On guard: Soldiers on patrol in Kashmir. (AP)                          
	Jammu, Sept. 1: A soldier was killed in firing by Pakistani troops along the Line of Control in Jammu, the latest in a series of violations of the ceasefire in force since 2003.        
	Lance Naik Dag Bahadur Gurung, 25, of the Gorkha Rifles was hit during the firing that continued for half an hour from 1.30am on Tuesday at Balnoi in the Poonch sector, army sources said.         
	Pakistani troops used small and medium weaponry to target the army positions, the sources added.         
	Gurung was rushed to hospital with bullet injuries but died there.        
	Lieutenant Colonel Biplab Nath, the defence spokesperson in Jammu, said the army had maintained restraint to avoid an escalation after the unprovoked firing.         
	Pakistan violated the ceasefire when they opened fire on our troops, said Brigadier General Staff (BGS) Gurdeep Singh of 16 Corps.        
	The sources, however, said there was no infiltration bid by militants during the incident, an occurrence common during such ceasefire violations. Pakistani soldiers engage Indian troops to help the intruders cross over.        
	Only a fortnight ago, the Border Security Force had foiled an infiltration bid in Jammus Samba area as militants attempted to sneak in crossing a river.        
	In June, a soldier was killed in firing during a sneak-in bid in Poonch but the army did not term the incident a ceasefire violation.         
	The ceasefire has largely held on the 1,086km Jammu and Kashmir border, which includes the LoC, the international border and actual ground position line. But there were at least three dozen violations last year and more this year.         
	 We will lodge a strong protest (over todays incident) at the next flag meeting between the two sides. The meeting was planned today but couldnt be held, an officer said.        
	The ceasefire came into force on November 26, 2003, helping keep the borders calm till the end of 2007.

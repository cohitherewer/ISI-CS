	Mumbai, March 18: A Jet Airways air hostess today jumped to death in the stairwell of her Powai home apparently after a tiff with her boyfriend over smoking.        
	Police said Anupama Acharya, 20, and Sameer Yajurvedi, a co-pilot with Jet Airways, got into an argument in her fourth-floor flat after he lit up around 3am. She then dashed out of her flat, rushed up one floor, climbed the banister and leaped into the stairwell.        
	Sameer told the police Anupama had been immediately taken to a local hospital but was declared dead on arrival.        
	Anupamas family lives in Bangalore.         
	The police said this was the fourth suicide reported in Mumbai in four days. On Tuesday, Meenu Lamba, a 37-year-old bank employee, jumped from the terrace of a building at Antop Hill in central Mumbai allegedly after quarrelling with husband Shamlal Lamba. The police have filed a case under IPC Section 306 (abetment of suicide) against Shamlal, 51.        
	The third suicide was by Minakshi Gotlikar, a 35-year-old woman working as a maid. She allegedly set herself on fire in Versova because her daughter  a Class IV student of an English-medium school  was watching too much TV instead of studying for her exams.        
	On Monday, a 16-year-old student, caught carrying answer chits to her geography exam, jumped off the terrace of her Ghatkopar home.

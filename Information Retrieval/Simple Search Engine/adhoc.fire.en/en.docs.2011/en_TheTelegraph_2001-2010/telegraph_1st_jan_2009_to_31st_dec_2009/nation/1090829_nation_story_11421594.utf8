          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Aug. 28: Purnamasi Ram, the JD(U) MP from Balmiki Nagar (north Bihar) who represented the Bagaha seat before winning his Lok Sabha ticket, is an unhappy man.        
	Following the trend of family first, Ram, too, reportedly harboured wishes of handing over the Bagaha legacy to son Vijay Kumar Ram. Incidentally, Bagaha is one of the 18 Assembly seats going to by-elections in September.        
	But, JD(U) leader and chief minister Nitish Kumar and his decision to not let senior leaders award tickets to close relations has proven to be a damper to fatherly ambitions.         
	Purnamasis efforts to persuade Nitish to grant a JD(U) ticket to son has failed and he has now fielded Vijay on an RJD ticket.         
	The rebellion, however, has failed to deter Nitish from his efforts to purge his party from nepotism. Nitish also refused Jehanabad MP Jagdish Sharma, who wished to field wife Shanti Sharma as a nominee on the Ghoshi seat. Jagdish, too, is fielding wife as an Independent. It is the age of womens empowerment and when my wife decided to enter the poll arena I supported her, he said.        
	Similarly, Purnamasi said: My son is a politician in his own right. He can choose any party as he wishes.         
	So far, Shanti Sharma was known more as a homemaker and Vijay was seldom spotted in the political arena.         
	Buoyed by the grand show in the past Lok Sabha polls, Nitish is taking steps to purge the party from parivaarwad (nepotism) and earn the faith of the party cadre by signalling that hard work and not family ties would win at the end of the day.         
	The chief ministers first experiment was to promote party worker Shailendra Kumar on the Nalanda seat  which Nitish represented. Shailendra won. Nitish, an instinctive politician, has understood that the NDA is better placed than rival UPA for the coming by-polls, with hardly any change in the political situation.         
	Despite the national-level turmoil, the BJP is in a strong alliance with the JD(U) in Bihar while the UPA remains a divided house. In such a scenario, by-elections are apparently heading for a predictable result.

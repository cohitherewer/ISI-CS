The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Random checks lined up at airports
                                                                                                               Random checks lined up at airports
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	New Delhi, March 7: One more layer of security is being planned at Indian airports: random checks before entering the airport building.         
	Increased threat perception and repeated incidents of ammunition being found at airports have prompted the decision.        
	The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), which guards 57 airports across the country except the one in Srinagar where the army and the state forces are in charge, will carry out random checks of baggage before passengers enter the airport building.         
	The CISF director-general, N.R. Das, said a trial for such a security check was carried out in Mumbai.         
	Sources said the exercise would soon be extended to all major airports in the country.        
	We find bullets from baggage almost every day, Das said.         
	On February 20, eight 7.62mm bullets were found in the mens rest room at the Indira Gandhi International airport in Delhi.         
	There will now be more pickets on the approach to the airport in Delhi. More than 20 threats were received for the Delhi airport alone last year.        
	Security at airports is now a three-step exercise, with an X-ray check at entry, another check before check-in and then before stepping on the tarmac.

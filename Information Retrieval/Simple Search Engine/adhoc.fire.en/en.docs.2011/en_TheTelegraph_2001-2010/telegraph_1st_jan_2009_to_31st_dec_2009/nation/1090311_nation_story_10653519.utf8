The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | LJP names Jharkhand candidates
                                                                                                               LJP names Jharkhand candidates
                            
	Patna, March 10 (PTI): Union minister Ram Vilas Paswans LJP will contest six seats in Jharkhand, where the party was not included in a seat-sharing arrangement announced by three other UPA partners.        
	LJP candidates will contest from Palamau, Chatra, Dhanbad, Hazaribagh, Koderma and Jamshedpur seats out of the 14 Lok Sabha seats in Jharkhand, party spokesman Sanjay Singh said today.         
	Ram Vilas Paswan has decided that his party will contest six seats in Jharkhand and has announced candidates for three, said Singh, the LJPs lone member in the Bihar Council.        
	He said former MP Ranjit Singh will be the partys nominee for Chatra, while LJP national secretary Virendra Pradhan will try his luck in Dhanbad and Nityanand Mahto in Hazaribagh.         
	Names of the remaining three candidates will be announced on March 15.        
	LJP was allegedly sidelined by UPA partners, Congress, JMM and RJD, who finalised an arrangement for all 14 seats yesterday. Congress will contest six seats, JMM five and RJD three.

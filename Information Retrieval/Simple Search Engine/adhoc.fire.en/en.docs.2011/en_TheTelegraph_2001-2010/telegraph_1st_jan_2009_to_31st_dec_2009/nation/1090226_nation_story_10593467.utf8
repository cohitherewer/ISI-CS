The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BSF worries about friend
                                                                                                               BSF worries about friend
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                           Ahmed                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 25: Major General Shakeel Ahmed, the Bangladesh Rifles director-general taken hostage by mutinying border guards, was a good sport when he lost a golf match with his Indian counterpart last year.         
	In the spirit that it was played, I am ready to lose many such matches, said Ahmed, who has been seen as a friend of India since he took charge on February 1, 2003.        
	As news of the mutiny broke this morning, BSF officers were on the phone trying to reach their counterparts. There was no reply.         
	Frantic calls were made to Colonel Saifullah, Major Humayun and other officers known to be close to Ahmed but not one was answered amid reports that the lives of the officers and their families living on the sprawling campus of the BDR headquarters might be in danger.         
	BSF-BDR relations appeared to have soured for good when 16 BSF men were killed in 2001 by BDR guards at Boraibari village on the border in Assam.        
	But that changed after Ahmed took over in 2003.         
	Last year, BSF constable R.P. Singh went across the border and killed four persons of a family in a drunken stupor. About to be lynched by angry crowds, Singh was rescued by BDR guards.         
	From Boraibari to this stage, it was thanks to Ahmed, said former BSF chief A.K. Mitra.         
	Mitra and Ahmed had several back-to-back meetings and paved the way for successful home secretary-level talks last August.         
	Ahmed and his team played a pivotal role in real-time intelligence sharing at the sector level and institutionalising flag meetings up to the sector commander level, sources said. This endeared him to the BSF brass and built trust between the forces that man the sensitive border on either side.         
	The bonhomie the officer had struck with the BSF had not been seen since the 1971 war when the forces fought jointly, the sources said.         
	So when reports of a threat to the lives of Ahmed, his wife Nazneen and their young son reached the BSF headquarters, there was a sense of shock.        
	There was also the fear that the mutiny led by BDR Naik Shafi would demolish in one stroke the carefully built channels of communication between the two sides. After the mutiny, it is unlikely that Ahmed will return to the BDR because the mutineers want the reins of the border force out of army hands.        
	At present, the BDR brass are drawn from among the ranks of army officers  Ahmed led the influential 66th infantry division of the army before moving to the border force.

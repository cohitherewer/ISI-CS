          OUR CORRESPONDENT                      Cooch Behar Palace                           
	Cooch Behar, July 29: Eighty-seven-year-old Amiya Kumar Deb Bakshi first heard about the demise of Gayatri Devi from news flashes this afternoon.         
	The octogenarian, who oversees all religious rituals on behalf of the Cooch Behar royal family, immediately called up Lily Pool, Gayatri Devis residence in Jaipur.         
	We have a woman from here who used to look after her. She told me the Rajmata was no more. I could not believe what she was telling me, Deb Bakshi said.        
	He recalled the weddings of all the three sisters, including that of Gayatri Devi. My father was the person in charge in 1940 when the wedding (Gayatri Devis) took place. I was also witness to the rituals. Later, since I took over after my father passed away in 1958, I was in constant touch with her, he said.         
	Deb Bakshi recalled a trip with Gayatri Devi to Varanasi in 1970, when he had gone to visit a temple owned by the Cooch Behar princess.         
	The shrine is now under a trust headed by the district magistrate of Cooch Behar.        
	In March 2006, the last time Gayatri Devi came to Cooch Behar, Deb Bakshi met her at the circuit house where she had put up.        
	I remember her asking me about my health. I, too, enquired how she was doing. We spoke at length about the running of Madanmohanbati, her familys temple here. She was interested in knowing how things were, Deb Bakshi said.        
	Now, however, he lamented there wasnt much he could do. There is nothing much for me to do but to send a condolence message to her family in Jaipur, he said.        
	Local historian Hiten Nag sat down to pen a few lines of condolence as soon as he heard about the death. The Cooch Behar royals were unique in the sense that they were very forward-looking and thought about the welfare of the people. The passing away of Gayatri Devi is a great loss for the country, Nag said.        
	People in general felt they had lost someone in whom they saw the real princess.         
	We had known princesses only from story books, but in Gayatri Devi we had the chance to see a real Rajmata whenever she came here. Now we shall see her no more, said Surendra Kumar Rathi, a local trader.        
	Cooch Behar district magistrate S. Mahapatra announced that all government offices and educational institutions would be closed tomorrow. A meeting will be held to chalk out a programme coinciding with the shradh ceremony of Gayatri Devi to be held in Jaipur.

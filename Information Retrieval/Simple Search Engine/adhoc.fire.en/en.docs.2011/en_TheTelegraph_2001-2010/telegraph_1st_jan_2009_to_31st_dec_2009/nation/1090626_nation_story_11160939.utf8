	Goaltore, June 25: Fresh companies of the Central Reserve Police Force moved into Goaltore today, increasing the possibility of an offensive from here to Ramgarh in the north of Lalgarh soon.        
	The arrival of the six companies of the 66th battalion, apart from 150 members of the paramilitary forces anti-Maoist Cobra unit, coincided with a meeting of top state officials at Writers Buildings to discuss ground conditions in Lalgarh.        
	The meeting, attended by IG (law and order) Raj Kanojia, IG (co-ordination) Bhupinder Singh, home secretary Ardhendu Sen and chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti, was held essentially to discuss strategic locations in Lalgarh.        
	A map of Lalgarh was downloaded from Google Earth and the strategic spots marked.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee held another meeting with Chakrabarti, Sen, director-general of police Sujit Sarkar and Kanojia at the secretariat later in the evening, signalling that an action in Lalgarh was possibly on the cards.        
	Asked when police would go into action in Lalgarh, chief secretary Chakrabarti said: It is not a question of when. The task of the police is to bring an end to terrorism in the area. The police will do whatever needs to be done.        
	Away in the battle zone, villagers carrying 6kg of rice each  relief doled out at the Goaltore block development office  walked up and down the road that the security forces might take tomorrow.        
	The villagers live and work in the zone that the police have not yet dared to patrol. The police are not sure if they will encounter resistance from blockades put up by villagers or by Maoist armed squads, or both.        
	The police and the paramilitary will have to draw fire and engage the rebels while forcing their way to Ramgarh  about 14km from here  unless the Maoists retreat to fight another day.        
	The road from Goaltore to Ramgarh runs over several culverts and a bridge over the river Kubai near Kadashole village, from where the gunmen who yesterday surrounded a team of journalists when they ventured beyond Pingboni are said to have emerged. Pingboni is 3km from here.        
	In the fields and forests on either side of the road from Pingboni, undulations offer cover. A march by the security forces off-the-road will need to be guided by Bengal police who alone know the area.         
	But Bengal police have little idea about the kind of opposition they might encounter, though there is a likelihood that the Maoists might decide not to take the security forces on frontally.        
	Police sources said the security forces would use mines when moving towards Ramgarh. While advancing we can attach these mines to branches of trees and then detonate them and the splinters will hit in a forward direction and not at our troops who will be behind, an official said.        
	Mortars, too, will be used, whether armed Maoists are spotted or not. If we suspect that Maoists could be hiding in a particular part of the jungle, well fire the mines even if we do not spot anyone, the officer said.        
	DIG (CID) S.N. Gupta and a team of CRPF officials walked a kilometre from Goaltore town towards Pingboni and held a meeting over maps. They returned to the town and held another round of meetings with senior police officials at the BDO office.        
	Jawans of the Indian Reserve Battalion and Eastern Frontier Rifles patrolled the 7km stretch between Goaltore town and Kiyamacha village to protect four bridges on the road.

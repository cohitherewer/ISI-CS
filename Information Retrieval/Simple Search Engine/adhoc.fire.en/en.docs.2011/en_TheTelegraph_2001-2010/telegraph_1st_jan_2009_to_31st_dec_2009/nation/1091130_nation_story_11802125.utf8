	Port of Spain, Nov. 29 (PTI): Prime Minister Manmohan Singh described Brian Lara as an icon and praised him for his cricketing skills during their meeting here yesterday.        
	The 40-year-old West Indian cricketer called on Singh on the sidelines of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM).         
	The world recognises you as an icon and enjoys your cricket, the Prime Minister told Lara during their 10-minute meeting.        
	Singh praised the former captain, who hails from Port of Spain.        
	Lara told him how much he liked India and enjoyed visiting the country in the past. He would like to travel to India again if he gets a chance, the cricketer added.        
	Lara is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen of all time. He is the only one to have ever scored a triple century, a quadruple century and a quintuple century in first-class games.        
	Lara retired from international cricket in 2007, after the World Cup was held in the Caribbean for the first time.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | From a Left family, the right notes
                                                                                                               From a Left family, the right notes
          CITHARA PAUL                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 23: Jamals rags-to-riches story could have been Resul Pookuttys tale too, minus the game show.        
	Born in a lower middle-class Muslim family in Kollam, Kerala, the sound mixing engineer who landed an Oscar today had a childhood of struggle. He was the youngest of eight children. His father was a private bus conductor actively involved in Left politics.         
	Many times, Resul had considered taking up a job to support his family though he was good in studies. But his mother insisted he should continue to be with his books no matter what. Our mother always had a soft corner for her youngest (son). She would always say he has some special talent, said Biju, Resuls brother.         
	Sound fascinated Resul from childhood. He would spend hours listening to the chirping of birds and the gurgling stream nearby though we made fun of him, Biju said.         
	Resul came to work in films after trying his hand at several things  selling milk, giving tuition, rearing cattle. But before that, he finished his graduation in physics and joined a law college in Thiruvananthapuram.         
	The subject did not hold his interest. So, he applied for a sound engineering course at the Film and Television Institute of India in Pune.         
	The first time, Resul failed to clear the test. The following year he took it again and topped.        
	Resul moved to Mumbai after his course at the film institute. He made his debut in sound design with the 1997 film Private Detective: Two Plus Two Plus One, directed by Rajat Kapoor.         
	Eight years later, he broke into the big league with Sanjay Leela Bhansalis Black.         
	Among his recent projects are Musafir (2004), Zinda (2006), Traffic Signal (2007), Gandhi, My Father (2007), another Bhansali film Saawariya (2007) and Dus Kahaniyaan (2007).         
	He is said to have walked out of Slumdog Millionaire after an argument with director Danny Boyle because he felt the team was not giving enough importance to the aspect of sound engineering. After winning his Bafta, he said: I would have been crying now had I not been persuaded to join back.         
	Today, Resul shared the honours with Ian Tapp and Richard Pryke.         
	I dedicate this award to my country, Resul said, beaming and emotional. This is not just a sound award but a piece of history that has been handed over to me. I come from a country and civilisation that gave the world the word that precedes silence and is followed by more silence. That word is Om. So I dedicate this award to my country.         
	He also said the award was a Shiv Ratri gift to all Indians.         
	Asked how a Muslim man came to mention a Hindu festival, Saifuddin, another of Resuls brothers, said: We were brought up in a thoroughly secular atmosphere. Our father used to say that love for humanity is greater than anything.         
	In a recent interview, Resul had dedicated his achievement to art movies in Malayalam.         
	Sound designing and mixing were never a good production aspect in Bollywood until Black came. But I grew up watching films in Malayalam, like Adoor Gopalakrishnans Elippathayam and Aravindans Kummatti, Pokkuveyil and Thampu, where the sublime use of sound represents the cultural context.... My work is an extension of theirs. Their works taught me the art of blending technology with aesthetics, he said.

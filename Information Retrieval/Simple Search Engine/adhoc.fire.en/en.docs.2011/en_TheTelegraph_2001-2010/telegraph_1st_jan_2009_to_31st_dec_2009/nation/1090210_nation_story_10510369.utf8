The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Shell out more to fly out of Delhi
                                                                                                               Shell out more to fly out of Delhi
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 9: Flying out of New Delhi will get more expensive from next month.        
	The government today allowed airport developer GMR to charge a fee of Rs 200 from each outbound domestic passenger and Rs 1,000 from every passenger taking an international flight out.         
	The airport development fee will be charged from March 1, 2009 and will be on top of the taxes already levied on each air ticket.         
	GMR-backed Delhi International Airport Private Limited (DIAL) will use the fee to partly fund the ongoing Rs 9,000-crore airport development programme that has hit a revenue crunch because of the economic slowdown. The fee is expected to cover an estimated shortfall of Rs 1,827 crore.        
	Although the fee is effective for three years, there could be a small change in the figures after the developer draws up the final cost estimates by August 31.         
	The government or the designated regulator will then determine the final development fee, which will also take into account bids received for leasing out parts of the airport property to hotels, restaurants and malls, which are expected to earn revenue for the developer.        
	DIAL, which is upgrading Indira Gandhi international airport, says it is finding it difficult to get funds from banks and financial institutions following the economic downturn. Decline in passenger traffic has also started pinching.        
	A funds crunch could delay completion of the first phase of modernising Delhi airport before the 2010 Commonwealth Games.         
	The development fee, which is being levied purely on an ad hoc basis, is inclusive of all applicable taxes and is for a period of 36 months only, a civil aviation ministry official said.         
	Domestic passengers pay a similar development fee of Rs 375 to fly out of Hyderabads new airport, while international passengers pay Rs 1,000. Last month, Bangalore International Airport Limited was allowed to charge user fee of Rs 260 from each domestic passenger leaving the airport and Rs 1,000 from international passengers.        
	User development fee is charged at new airports for several years to recover the investment, whereas airport development fee is charged to fund an ongoing project and is spent on construction.         
	The money is usually collected by airlines and paid to the airport developer. However, in case tickets are issued without development fee, it can be charged separately at the airport.

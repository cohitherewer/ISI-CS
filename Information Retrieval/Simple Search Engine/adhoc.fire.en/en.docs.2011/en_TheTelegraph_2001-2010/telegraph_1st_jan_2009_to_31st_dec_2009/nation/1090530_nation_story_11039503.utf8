The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sonia amp; Rahul on head hunt
                                                                                                               Sonia amp; Rahul on head hunt
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Rahul Gandhi: Work ahead                                  
	New Delhi, May 29: Manmohan Singh can sleep in peace now that ministry-making is over, but theres no such luck for Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi yet.         
	The Congress president and her general secretary son now have to fill party posts that will fall vacant as senior office-bearers have crossed over to the government. They also plan to streamline the organisation, flag the membership drive and run through organisational elections before December 2010.        
	Rahul is keen the elections should have the same transparency and democracy he sought to infuse in the Youth Congress polls held in Punjab and Uttarakhand this year for the first time in decades.        
	Sonia stressed the parity of the party with the government, if not its primacy, in her first address to new Congress MPs. The importance of the party was buttressed by the perception that Rahul would no longer be as hands off as he was in 2004, when he was elected MP for the first time.         
	After he was informally placed in the Congress pantheon with Sonia and Singh in election 2009, party sources said they were convinced he would have at least as much of a say as Sonia in the appointment of office-bearers.         
	Sources were already speaking of how Rahulji was dipping into the states for talent and skills after the Delhi pool looked a bit depleted.        
	Among those expected to leave their Congress posts now that they are ministers are general secretaries Ghulam Nabi Azad, Mukul Wasnik, Prithviraj Chavan and V. Narayanaswamy. So also M. Veerappa Moily, who headed the partys media cell, and secretary Jairam Ramesh. The one person one post formula would be scrupulously followed, unlike in 2004 where party-government crossovers were frequent, sources said.        
	Janardhan Dwivedi, general secretary in charge of the organisation, said: This cannot be said with certainty. But there will be effort made to see that those who work in the government concentrate on it and those who work in the party do organisational work.        
	Sonia issued a veiled perform-or-perish edict to her ministers yesterday. Asked if there would be no shuffles with the ministry nearly touching its upper limit, she said: Some of those who are inside can make way for others.         
	Among those in Sonias present team, Rahul is said to be comfortable with general secretary Digvijay Singh who is minding Uttar Pradesh. Two secretaries, Jitendra Singh and Meenakshi Natarajan, are members of his core team. He has a social relationship with Rajiv Shukla, who is in with Bollywood and cricket.        
	Sources said some secretaries could be promoted as general secretaries, and in their place Rahul could induct his nominees from the Youth Congress and the NSUI.        
	Oscar Fernandes, the former labour minister, is almost certain to come in as a general secretary. Rita Bahuguna Joshi, the Uttar Pradesh Congress president, could also become general secretary.

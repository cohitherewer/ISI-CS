          NASIR JAFFRY IN ISLAMABAD AND OUR DELHI BUREAU                            Manmohan Singh (left), Yousaf Raza Gilani                                
	July 18: A Pakistani anti-terrorist court today started pre-trial proceedings of the five accused in the Mumbai attacks case, a move being seen as part of the probable guarantees Pakistan had given to India in the run-up to the joint statement that kicked up dust in Parliament yesterday.        
	Judge Baqir Ali Rana adjourned the hearing until July 25 after the state filed an application, requesting in-camera proceedings in the case, Shahbaz Rajput, defence counsel for one of the accused, Hamad Ameen Sadiq, told The Telegraph.         
	Rajput said he and other three lawyers, Khwaja Sultan, Sardar Tariq and Malik Rafiq representing the other four accused, have sought copies of the documents about the case after the state formally appointed them as defence counsel for the five suspects who were taken into custody by early this year for interrogation.         
	The accused included Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, a top Lashkar-e-Toiba operative and the alleged mastermind of the attacks and other four facilitators, Sadiq, Mazhar Iqbal, Abdul Wajid and Shahid Jamil.         
	Sadiq facilitated the funds and hideouts for the Mumbai terror attacks, while Iqbal was the handler, according to Pakistani investigators. Wajid offered computer expertise and Jamil trained crew members of Al-Hussaini, the vessel that took the attackers towards Mumbai.        
	I have also filed an application in the court asking to provide us details of the evidence so that we can prepare ourselves for defence, Rajput said.         
	The case will be heard in camera at Adiala jail in Rawalpindi.        
	Pakistani law enforcement agencies are chasing at least 13 more accused who have been declared proclaimed offenders for their alleged involvement in the Mumbai attacks.         
	Pakistani officials expressed dismay at media reports that Islamabad had acknowledged the role of the Lashkar in a dossier handed over to deputy high commissioner Manpreet Vohra last week.        
	It is unfair to cast such insinuations at a time Pakistan has begun the trial of the five accused on the basis of evidence sought from India and collected by its own investigators, a foreign ministry official said.        
	A PTI report said Pakistan Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani today blamed India for interference in Balochistan and other areas. Gilani told journalists that the joint statement signed by him and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh underlines our concerns over Indias interference in Balochistan and other areas of Pakistan.        
	Sources in Delhi, however, said Islamabads swift decision on the trial was probably part of the assurances given to the Indian side on the sidelines of the NAM summit in Egypt.         
	The trial may go some way in strengthening Singhs hands when he faces the Opposition in Parliament on Monday. The BJP walked out of the Lok Sabha on Friday, alleging that de-linking terror and the composite dialogue process meant a sellout.        
	Official sources in Delhi, keen to project the joint statement at Egypts Sharm-al-Sheikh as a positive step in the direction of normalising ties, indicated that more visible steps were expected from Pakistan in the days to come.        
	Following the dossier they have presented to India, we have been assured that follow-up action will be taken, the sources said. The resumption of the trial is one among them.

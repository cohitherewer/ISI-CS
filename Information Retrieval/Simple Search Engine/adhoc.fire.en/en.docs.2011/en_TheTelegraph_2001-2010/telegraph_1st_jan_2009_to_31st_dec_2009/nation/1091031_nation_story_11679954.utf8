          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Oct. 30: Rahul Gandhi today campaigned against Mulayam Singh Yadavs daughter-in-law, apparently breaking an unwritten code that the Yadavs and the Gandhis wouldnt take the stage against each other in family contests.        
	Rahul canvassed for the Congresss Raj Babbar  who had crossed over from Mulayams party  in Firozabad, from where Dimple Yadav is fighting the November 7 Lok Sabha bypoll.        
	Samajwadi leaders complained that Rahul didnt show any political courtesy. Were shocked. First, the Congress nominated turncoat Raj Babbar. Then they sent leaders like Rahul to campaign, which is against political courtesy, Samajwadi spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary said. Senior leader Amar Singh said Rahuls presence virtually signalled the end of relations between the two parties.         
	Dimple is the wife of Mulayams MP son Akhilesh, who vacated the Firozabad seat because he had also won from Kannauj.

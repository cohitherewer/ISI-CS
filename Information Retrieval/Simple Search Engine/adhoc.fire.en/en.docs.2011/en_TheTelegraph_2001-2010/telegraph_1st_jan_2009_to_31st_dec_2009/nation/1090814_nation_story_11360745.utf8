The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sibal signals babudom end in education
                                                                                                               Sibal signals babudom end in education
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           Kapil Sibal                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 13: Kapil Sibal has indicated to his officials that he doesnt want a career bureaucrat or police officer to head any educational body, signalling a shift towards academicians alone governing education.        
	The human resource development minister has indicated, verbally and through office notes, that he does not want IAS or IPS officers to be appointed head of any educational authority under the ministry, The Telegraph has learnt.         
	The move represents a decisive shift from the earlier practice under successive ministers of allowing bureaucrats to run key authorities regulating different sectors of education.         
	Sibals predecessor Arjun Singh had even approved the name of IPS officer Pragya Srivastava for the post of CBSE board chief before the department of personnel and training raised objections.        
	But Sibals new plan faces its first challenge in the appointment of a new vice- chancellor for Jamia Millia Islamia. The minister is keen to appoint an academician in charge of the university in line with his policy, sources said.         
	But three of the five people shortlisted  through a process started before Sibal took over  by a search panel are bureaucrats, including one who is retired.         
	The remaining two are academicians  incumbent vice-chancellor Mushirul Hasan and Faizan Ahmed, director of the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Basic Sciences at Jamia.        
	Hasans qualifications as a scholar are considered superior by most in the ministry, but large sections of the Muslim community, including several MPs, have opposed a second term for him. Congress leaders, keen not to alienate powerful sections of the community, are also learnt to have expressed concerns over a possible reappointment of Hasan.        
	The vice-chancellors appointment, however, only represents the first of similar challenges that Sibal may face in implementing the policy of keeping top educational posts for academicians.         
	The acting chairman of CBSE, Vineet Joshi, is an IAS officer and is rated highly for his administrative skills by several veterans in the HRD ministry.        
	Joshi was asked to take over a year back after Ashok Ganguly, also a bureaucrat, completed eight years in charge of the countrys largest school board. Ganguly was first appointed when Murli Manohar Joshi was HRD minister during the NDAs rule.        
	A series of extensions given to Joshi, while the ministry searched for a CBSE chief, ended on July 31. The department of personnel and training has now given him a fresh extension as the ministry invites new applications for the chairmans post. But the circular advertising the latest round of selections clearly states that the ministry will prefer someone from an education background.         
	The previous circular, for the last round of selections, had stated as the essential criterion three years as a senior educational administrator. This circular, in line with Sibals policy, adds that five years experience in education or educational administration or both are desirable.         
	Ever since Gangulys term ended, we have failed to find, in our numerous selection attempts, someone who meets the standards we are looking for, forcing us to continue with Joshi. Now, his prospects appear to have dimmed, a source said.

	Nagpur, Feb. 6: The BJP today tried to clarify its stand on key issues ahead of the elections but ended up parading its confusion, especially on Pakistan and economic policy.        
	In his presidential address on the party national executives opening day, Rajnath Singh tore into the Manmohan Singh government for failing to put enough pressure on Islamabad following the Mumbai attacks.        
	In the same breath, he warned Sonia Gandhi against talking about a military option, accusing her of using war talk for electoral gains.        
	The BJP, however, had made the Kargil war its central plank in the 1999 election. Even today, Rajnath accused the UPA government of diplomatic blunders in connection with Pakistan and asked India to opt out of the joint anti-terror mechanism.        
	His attack on Sonia, however, betrayed the BJPs fears about the Congress making political gains through some tough-talking on Pakistan.        
	Party spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad tried to paper over the contradiction saying war should not be used to meet political ends, but struggled to explain the BJPs exploitation of Kargil.        
	The biggest surprise came when Rajnath rejected the western economic model which, he said, had failed. He claimed the Centres economic policy had promoted crass consumerism and greed, and said economists should come up with an Indian model based on the Mahatmas vision.        
	Although the BJP has touted Swadeshi in the past, the Vajpayee government had enthusiastically followed the western policy of liberalisation. Besides, the BJP has repeatedly accused the UPA of slowing down economic reforms under the Lefts pressure.        
	Party poster boy Narendra Modi has endeared himself to business leaders by embracing the market with a passion, and L.K. Advani has promised to push reforms if the BJP comes to power.        
	If Rajnaths statement signalled a change in party position, Prasads defence of it appeared lukewarm.        
	This is food for thought, the spokesperson said. The communist and capitalist models have failed and hence our party president mooted this proposal for evolving a model more suited to Indian conditions.        
	The party appeared in two minds also on its pet Hindutva themes, which Rajnath had championed at e very recent national conclave. Today, he made a passing reference to minority appeasement but did not speak a word on the Ram setu, Ayodhya temple, the Congresss anti-Hindu mindset or pseudo-secularism.

  - Currency of National Bank of Azad Hind on display          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          The stamps and the notes for Provisional Government of Azad Hind. (Badrika Nath Das)                                        
	Cuttack, Nov. 1: The Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Birthplace Museum here is set to come up with two galleries to explain the concepts of Azad Hind Radio and National Bank of Azad Hind.        
	Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose had formed the Provisional Government of Azad Hind on October 21, 1943, and had declared a war against the British and its allies on October 23, 1943, from the Azad Hind Radio station. The Provisional Government as a follow-up established the National Bank of Azad Hind and struck its coins and currency.        
	Efforts are underway to recreate this Azad Hind Radio and National Bank of Azad Hind in two separate galleries to give visitors a feel of how they were functioning as concepts integral to Netajis concept of the Provisional Government of Azad Hind, said curator J.P. Das talking to The Telegraph.        
	The gallery which is to be devoted to Azad Hind Radio will focus on the history of the station started in Germany on January 7, 1942, to unite Indians to fight for freedom. Its headquarters was shifted to Singapore and later to Rangoon following the war in southeast Asia.        
	There will be declarations which were broadcast by the four radio stations that functioned under the propaganda and publicity department of Azad Hind Government, Das explained.         
	Besides, we will try to play the verse penned by Bahadur Shah Zafar which used to open the programmes for Azad Hind programme, he added. The verse stated  Ghazio mein by rahegi jab talak iman ki, Tab toh London tak chalegi regh Hindusta ki (So long as crusaders are inspired by faith, the Indian sword will continue to sweep up to London).        
	The gallery devoted to National Bank of Azad Hind will display rare notes and coins to be used under Netajis Provisional Government.         
	Records that are with the gallery indicate that the bank was established in Rangoon in April of 1944 to keep the money collected by Azad Hind Government. The bank supposedly had an authorised capital of Rs 50 lakh and a paid-up capital of Rs 25 lakh.

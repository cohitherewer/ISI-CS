The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Apollo cites patient risk
                                                                                                               Apollo cites patient risk
          G.S. MUDUR                              
	New Delhi, Aug.12: The Apollo hospitals group has said it is not in a position to handle H1N1 patients, citing potential risk to other patients.        
	The group said tonight that it would like to do everything possible with respect to the H1N1 pandemic, but it was not in a position to provide facilities for H1N1 flu screening, sample collection or in-patient treatment.         
	We cannot put our patients, many of whom are immunocompromised, at risk by exposing them to the infection, the Apollo Indraprastha Hospital in Delhi said in a statement.        
	A spokesperson for the hospital told The Telegraph that the statement would apply to its hospitals in Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Calcutta, Chennai, Delhi and Hyderabad. At this point in time, we do not have a separate facility or space to manage patients with H1N1 infection, the spokesperson said.        
	The health ministry has said that hospitals  public or private  that manage H1N1 should establish special isolation facilities so that the H1N1 infection does not spread within the hospital.         
	A hospital willing to manage H1N1 patients should have a separate OPD (out-patient department) to keep patients with flu symptoms away from patients who have come for (treatment of) other illnesses, said a senior doctor at a government institution.         
	Besides the potential risk of spreading the infection, other patients in the OPD may also find it disagreeable to share a closed space with patients who are coughing or sneezing. Ideally, you need an OPD with a separate entry and exit where patients with respiratory symptoms can be screened.        
	A senior health official said this evening that if the capacity of government hospitals was felt to be inadequate to meet the numbers of patients, states were empowered to invoke the epidemic act which would allow them to use private institutions.         
	In Bangalore, St Johns Hospital has already begun admitting and treating patients infected with H1N1.

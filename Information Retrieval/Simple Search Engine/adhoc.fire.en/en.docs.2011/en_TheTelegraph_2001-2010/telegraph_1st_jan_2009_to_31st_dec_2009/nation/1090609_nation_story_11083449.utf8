	Raipur, June 8 (PTI): A policeman was killed and six others, including a CRPF assistant commandant, were injured in two Maoist attacks in Naryanpur and Bijapur districts, respectively, today.        
	According to Amrish Mishra, the Narayanpur superintendent of police, a policeman was killed in an ambush, 250km from Raipur. A group of Naxalites attacked Santosh Sharma as soon as he came out of his police camp at Dhanora village. Sharma was killed on the spot, Mishra said.        
	The rebels fled as soon as policemen thronged the scene hearing the gunshots. Policeman Shrikant Pandya was also injured in the attack and is undergoing treatment.        
	In Bijapur, 400km from Raipur, six security personnel were injured in a red ambush. A joint patrol team comprising CRPF jawans and district police from Gangalpur police station was attacked by rebels near Sawnar forests. Six security men, including the assistant commandant of the 85th Battalion, were injured, police said, adding that additional forces were sent to the spot after the attack. The injured were airlifted and are undergoing treatment at a Jagdalpur hospital.         
	The second encounter that began in the morning in the thick jungles under Gangalur police station, lasted for five hours, during which CRPF assistant commandant Satwant Singh was injured, along with a head constable and a jawan.        
	Two officers of the Chhattisgarh special police were also injured in the encounter that began soon after a team of the CRPF and local police entered the forests after receiving a tip-off.        
	One head constable who had sustained minor injuries was administered first-aid. Officials said the rebels usually take away their dead or injured companions.

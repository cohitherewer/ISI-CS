The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP ends meet, minus solution
                                                                                                               BJP ends meet, minus solution
          SANJAY K. JHA                      Advani                          
	New Delhi, Aug. 21: The BJPs chintan baithak has proved an exercise in self-defeatism that neither cleared the cobwebs of the past nor drew the sketch for the future.        
	The tentative attempt to find the causes of this years poll defeat got stuck in the storm over the leak of the Bal Apte committee report which, ironically, highlighted those very reasons.        
	Party president Rajnath Singh declared after the three-day meet in Shimla today that L.K. Advani would remain leader of Opposition and there wouldnt be any compromise on ideology, decisions that didnt need a brainstorming.        
	Rajnath made ritual noises about not tolerating indiscipline promoting youth, fighting for the poor and the farmers, encouraging SC-ST and expanding political base to newer territories but his tough posturing came a day after the report leak ruckus at the meeting and a day before a defiant Vasundhara Raje meets central leaders.         
	She is expected to drive a hard bargain before accepting the diktat to quit as leader of the Opposition in the Rajasthan Assembly.        
	Advani did his best to underline that the baithak was not a futile exercise. But instead of reeling off achievements, all he could say is that the decision to introspect in itself is a major first step.        
	A senior leader summed up the mood in Delhi: The meet that was supposed to do introspection in complete isolation, away from the media glare, and ironically it got consigned to a hysterical public spectacle.

                                                                                                               Courts migrant pill: ID cards
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                          Balakrishnan                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 15: The Supreme Court today asked the Centre to issue identity cards to all Indians as a way to curb illegal immigration by Bangladeshis.        
	The order comes in the middle of a police crackdown on Bangladeshi immigrants in Delhi after home minister P. Chidambaram said on Sunday that these people had no business being in India.        
	The court asked the government to immediately create a National Identity Register and issue Multi-Purpose National Identity Cards (MPNICs) to all citizens, starting with Assam and other northeastern states. The Centre had proposed to do this in an affidavit in 2006, but the scheme is yet to take off.        
	The MPNIC cards, the court said, should be the basis for Indian citizens to receive ration cards or school admission, or for their inclusion in electoral rolls.        
	You can start this at the village level create a situation whereby a person not in possession of this card is not in a position to avail any facility. Then he wont stay here. Now they (illegal immigrants) get better facilities than Indian citizens, Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan said as the court resumed hearing of a public interest litigation.        
	Although police do crack down on Bangladeshi infiltrators from time to time, their numbers have swelled to two crores, petitioner .P. Saxena had claimed. The similarity of language and culture between the immigrants and Indian Bengalis makes identification difficult. Besides, migrants from Bengal say they are often victimised during such crackdowns in Delhi or elsewhere.        
	At todays hearing, the Bengal government said Bangladesh had refused to accept previously identified illegal immigrants. It added that Bengal, unlike Assam, did not have tribunals for identifying foreigners.        
	The state government asked the court to help set up a proper mechanism to identify and deport Bangladeshis.         
	The court asked the Centre to set up more tribunals and talk to Dhaka about deportation. It adjourned the matter for eight weeks.        
	By then, the Centre must hand in a report mentioning the steps it has taken to identify and deport illegal Bangladeshi immigrants, the court said.

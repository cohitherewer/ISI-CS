          SANJAY K. JHA AND RASHEED KIDWAI                                            
	Sept. 2: Y.S.R. Reddy, known in Congress circles as the leader who never sleeps without reading a few pages of the Bible, is one of the most trusted lieutenants of the leadership with an ability to arrange funds as effectively as crowds.        
	YSR is gifted with many skills a politician requires  mass appeal, resources, political acumen and administrative experience.        
	The Congress, which almost looked jinxed at one point when the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi was followed by the untimely deaths of other frontline leaders like Jitendra Prasada, Rajesh Pilot and Madhavrao Scindia, considers YSR as one of its most valuable assets.         
	It was YSRs famous padyatra before the 2004 Andhra Assembly election that turned the tide against Chandrababu Naidu, setting the stage for the NDAs exit from power at the national level.        
	Even in the 2009 general election, the Congress wouldnt have done as well without YSRs astonishing act of slaying the anti-incumbency demon. He emerged as the undisputed leader of the state after his second victory, wiping out whatever challenge that existed in his first tenure.        
	The abilities of YSR first caught the attention of P.V. Narasimha Rao. Rao had just taken over as Prime Minister and, in the home state of Andhra Pradesh, he was not too happy with the old guard represented by N. Janardhan Reddy (NJR) and the towering NTR in the Opposition ranks.        
	At the Tirupati plenary in April 1992, the temple-town saw larger-than-life cut-outs of YSR all over. YSR contested the Congress Working Committee elections and did not make it to the top 10 but his vote share had surpassed those of the standing of N.D. Dutt Tiwari and Bhajan Lal.        
	Since 1992, YSR, aka Lion of Kadapa, emerged as a principal dissident leader in Andhra, constantly challenging the might of Janardhan, Vijaya Bhaskara Reddy and M. Chenna Reddy. YSR could become a minister in the state only once and was never included in the Union cabinet despite being a four-time MP primarily because of his rebellious ways.        
	Post-Babri demolition, YSR looked at 10 Janpath for direction and joined the ranks of Rajesh Pilot, Digvijay Singh, Ashok Gehlot, Ramesh Chennithala and other young turks.        
	By 2004, YSR had pulled past his peers in the Congress. On May 11, 2004, two days before the verdict of the general election was delivered, the counting of votes in the Andhra Assembly polls began at 7.30am. By 10am, the rout of Chandrababu Naidu and the rise of YSR were being beamed on television screens across the country.        
	Outside 10 Janpath, a small crowd from the Delhi Congress had gathered. The then DPCC general secretary, Shamim Ahmad, could not resist prophesising: Aaj Andhra Pradesh, kal saara desh (Andhra today, the whole country tomorrow. Two days later, the Congress was on its way back to power at the Centre.         
	The Congress tally of 148 (as a single largest party then) had 29 out of 42 MPs from Andhra. Five years later, it was once again Andhra Pradesh that led from the front.        
	Since 2004, YSRs standing has been several notches above the other chief ministers of the Congress-ruled states. If some of the welfare schemes in irrigation and rural healthcare helped him score points, so did his loyalty to the Nehru-Gandhi family. In 2005, he equated Sonia with Mahatma Gandhi, even though he took care never to flaunt his proximity to 10 Janpath.        
	In 2006, he and his wife served Rayalaseema cuisine to Rahul, Sonia and Manmohan Singh. Rahul later reportedly took down the recipe for a groundnut chutney from Vijayalakshmi aunty.        
	Although an MBBS, YSR engrossed himself so deeply in politics that he hardly practised medicine.        
	Tonight, several Congress colleagues were praying for YSR, recalling his frequent references to how he keeps the Bible under his pillow.

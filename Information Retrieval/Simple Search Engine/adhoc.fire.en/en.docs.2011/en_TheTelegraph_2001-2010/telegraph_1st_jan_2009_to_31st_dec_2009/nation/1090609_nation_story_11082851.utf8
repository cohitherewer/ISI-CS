          JAYANTH JACOB AND JOHN MARY                              
	June 8: The CPM politburo today threw its weight behind Pinarayi Vijayan as he faced possible prosecution for corruption, but rival V.S. Achuthanandan looked poised to swim against the tide.        
	In Kerala, CPM workers took to the streets across the state, forcing a virtual shutdown. Police looked askance as activists picketed in front of Raj Bhavan, raising slogans and burning governor R.S. Gavais effigies. Elsewhere, cars were set ablaze and highway traffic disrupted.        
	The politburo said it was unfortunate the governor had sanctioned the Kerala CPM secretarys prosecution in the Lavalin scandal, but vowed that the party would fight the case both politically and legally.        
	Achuthanandan confined himself to saying the party will discuss the case comprehensively and take the appropriate decision. Sources said he was limbering up for fireworks at the central committee and politburo meetings this month.        
	The sources said the Kerala chief minister, locked in a bitter feud with Vijayan, had started conveying to leaders that the party cannot wish away a corruption case against a politburo member.         
	So far, the party had calmed him down and kept him in check by asking him to wait for something concrete to happen. With Gavais green signal being seen a concrete enough development, it would be difficult to keep him quiet any longer, the sources said.        
	Achuthanandan is apparently hoping the June 19 politburo meet and the June 21-22 central committee meet would give him a chance to explain his stand. More so since the scandal was an unprecedented development and had hit CPM fortunes in the elections.        
	Barring Achuthanandan, most state leaders rallied behind Vijayan. Ministers questioned the governors decision to sanction prosecution overruling the council of ministers. It was quite an unusual decision, law minister M. Vijayakumar said.        
	Politburo member Brinda Karat said the Kerala CPM would discuss the matter.The Opposition Congress, however, cited a legal precedent. Oommen Chandy said the party should submit itself to law and appreciate the governors discretionary powers to overrule the cabinet decision.        
	Chandy cited a 2004 Supreme Court order upholding the then Madhya Pradesh governors sanction to prosecute two former ministers, Rajender Kumar Singh and Hisahu Ram Yadav, for corruption.        
	We presume that a high authority like the council of ministers will normally act in a bona fide manner, fairly, honestly and in accordance with law. However, on those rare occasions where the bias becomes apparent and/or the decision of the council of ministers is shown to be irrational and based on non-consideration of relevant factors, the governor would be right... to act in his own discretion and grant sanction, the judgment said.

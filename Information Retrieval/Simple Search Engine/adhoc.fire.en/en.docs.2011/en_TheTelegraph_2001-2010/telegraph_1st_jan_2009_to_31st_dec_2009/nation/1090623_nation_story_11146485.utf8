	New Delhi, June 22: Run a Google search, find a runaway lad.         
	Delhi police have tracked down with the help of Orkut, a networking site hosted by Google, a teenager who ran away from home after scoring below expectations in his Class XII board exams.        
	Siddhant Singh, 18, was found on Saturday, almost a month after he disappeared on May 22, the day of the results, with the help of an Orkut friend who got in touch with his family and helped initiate the search. Siddhant was disappointed he had secured 56 per cent.        
	We were alerted when Siddhanth visited the Orkut account of one of his friends. That friend got in touch with Siddhants family who, in turn, informed us. His other friends had also appealed to him online to return home, said special cell officer L.N. Rao. Siddhants father is a sub-inspector in the same cell.        
	While away from home, the student of Police Public School in Safdarjung Enclave couldnt resist his daily trysts with Orkut in cyber cafes, even though he was earning only a small sum working in a tea stall in nearby Faridabad.        
	Delhi police officers, armed with training in computer-related crimes, contacted Google to get the Internet protocol address  a code specifying the location of the computer where a site has been viewed.        
	After the address is known, the police can trace the house, office or cyber caf where the computer is located with the help of the Internet service provider.        
	In this case, the address pointed to a caf in Faridabad but Siddhant couldnt be found when the cops went there. In the clients register, which cafes are required to keep under police instructions, he had given the wrong address.        
	The investigators again approached Google, which this time gave them a second address that led them to another caf in the same area. At this caf, which had a CCTV, the images showed Siddhant in front of a computer many times.        
	Convinced he was in the neighbourhood, the officers went around with a photo. Locals recognised him and led the cops to the tea stall. The stalls owner had given him accommodation that he shared with other employees.        
	Siddhants parents and two sisters seem luckier than some other families where children couldnt cope with result blues: six committed suicide in the first 10 days of June.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | On play in MP politics: T-Series
                                                                                                               On play in MP politics: T-Series

	T-Series isnt unknown to cassette and CD buyers. But in Madhya Pradesh politics, T signifies Thakurs  who seem to be on song for decades.        
	The community wields a lot of influence in the leadership of the Congress and the BJP, the two contenders for power in the state.         
	The Thakurs unbroken spell of domination seems longer in the Congress, going as far back as 1980. Observers view this year as a watershed for the T-Series: Arjun Singh, the current Union human resource development minister, had edged out Shivbanu Solanki, a powerful tribal leader, to become chief minister.        
	Arjun was succeeded by another Thakur, Digvijay Singh, who left his mark on the states politics as chief minister for two terms.        
	While Arjun is at the fag end of his political career, Digvijay has turned a full-time national leader.         
	In the state Congress, a Brahmin, Suresh Pachauri, is at the helm, but the campaign-in-charge is still a Thakur  Arjuns son Ajay. The general secretary, too, is said to be an influential leader from the community, Rajiv Singh.        
	The seemingly endless Thakur spell has prompted jokes in Congress corridors that another T-Series leader can come up anytime.         
	A version of the T-Series is also being played in the BJP. State party chief Narendra Singh Tomar is a Thakur, as is Makhan Singh, the influential secretary in charge of the organisation.         
	The organisation-in-charge, seen as a powerful party post, was from the community even when Uma Bharti was chief minister. Kaptan Singh Solanki held the post then.        
	The Thakurs, said to be descendants of erstwhile royal families, make up only 2 per cent of the voters but have wielded influence bigger than their numbers, in part because of their lineage.

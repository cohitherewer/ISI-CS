The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | 10 EYEOPENERS OF THIS ELECTION
                                                                                                               10 EYEOPENERS OF THIS ELECTION
          
	Sanjays a flop        
	Sanjay Dutt has gone from Munnabhai to Khalnayak in one election, and hes not even contesting. The goodwill that only appeared to grow through his jail term and conviction in the Bombay blasts case has been frittered away in the jhappis and pappis the actor threatened to give Mayavati, in his blatant attempt to play the communal card but, perhaps most of all, in his unkind attacks on sister Priya who has said not a word in return.  
	If theres a lesson for Sanjay, its this: its all about loving your family. Indians will forgive a brush with the law, even a terror charge, but a big brother who piles mud on a supportive sister is a villain  
	Salmans a hit        
	The other bad boy of Bollywood was a revelation as campaigner. Salman Khan was in UP one day campaigning for a Congress candidate, in Punjab the next for a BJP nominee and in Maharashtra the third for the NCP  and he had the Sena rooting for him too. Salman pulled the crowds, was punctual and had the right lines, too: please vote, and vote for a candidate who will work for you, beware of people who try to divide you in the name of religion and... listen to your parents. Salman brought up his Hindu mother and Muslim father but, unlike Sanjay, used it to preach unity. And hes campaigned for Priya, too        
	Power of the shoe        
	Who would have thought a shoe was all it would take to deny Jagdish Tytler and Sajjan Kumar a place in Parliament? Certainly not the two Congress leaders who had shrugged off accusations that they were lead actors in the 1984 riots. Nor the survivors of that massacre of Sikhs who had for 25 years been fighting for justice, only to see Tytler and Kumar rewarded with party tickets and ministries. The CBIs clean chit to Tytler just ahead of elections rubbed salt on the wounds of a community that saw no hope of justice. Then journalist Jarnail Singhs shoe came flying, and out were booted the two        
	Importance of Sajjan Kumar        
	The Congress withdrew the South Delhi ticket from the riot-tainted Sajjan Kumar and told the world it was a party sensitive to the feeling of hurt in a community. No case had been proved against Sajjan, it said, but the Congress had denied him the chance to contest the election because the 1984 riot victims saw him as a villain. Then, having taken the moral high ground and earned brownie points, the sensitive party went ahead and gave that ticket to Ramesh Kumar, whose only claim to fame is that he is Sajjan Kumars brother. Does politics get any more cynical than this?        
	Modi the weak        
	Guess whos taking cover from shoes? When Narendra Modi campaigned in Gujarat, he had a plastic net put up in front of the dais at the meetings  the first time at Anand it was 2-foot-high, by the next rally in Ahmedabad it had gone up to 5 feet. That the chief minister who, at best, is accused of looking away when over a thousand Muslims were massacred in his state should expect people to want to throw shoes at him is no surprise. But that the BJPs macho man, who thunders Atankvad se ladne ke liye chhati chahiye (You need courage to deal with terrorism), should do so from behind the safety of a net to keep out the shoes would bring a smile to many lips        
	Singh the strong        
	Manmohan Singh is not afraid of mud-wrestling.         
	Challenger L.K. Advani had gone on and on about Indias weakest PM in what seemed a one-sided battle. Singh conceded he was no match for orator Advani. Then came the punches: Was oratory proof of strength, was it even necessary to run the country? Was the Kandahar hijack proof of Advanis strength? What was his contribution, the Babri demolition? Point made, Singh stopped, just as suddenly as he had started. But no one was asking anymore if the PM had the fight in him   
	Is that the BSP?   
	The BSP is going in for a serious change of image. Founded by Kanshi Ram, it was the self-proclaimed party of the downtrodden  the lowest in the social order and often the poorest. In 2007, it reached out to the top of the social order, the new Brahmin votes winning it the crown of Lucknow and shaking up its identity. In 2009, it appears to be aiming to bridge the class divide, too  one of the richest candidate this election is Deepak Bharadwaj of the BSP. Contesting from West Delhi, the builder has a declared net worth of Rs 622 crore  
	Pranab cant speak Hindi        
	Pranab Mukherjee has lived and worked in Delhi for 40 years, no less, but he cant speak Hindi. So he told us after a war of words with Lalu Prasad. Pranab had accused the ally of using the Congress as a doormat and said Lalu wouldnt be part of the next UPA government, if there was one. All this at a public rally in the RJDs home ground of Bihar. A phone call from Lalu was all it took for the two to kiss and make up, and the blame for the allies tiff to fall on broken Hindi. Lalu Prasad advised me over the phone that henceforth I should speak in English instead of broken Hindi, Pranab later smiled        
	Varun the politician        
	Varun Gandhi, who? At the start of the election, this young Gandhi was a nobody  as much as anyone bearing that surname can be. After years of trying to get a BJP ticket, the 29-year-old finally looked set to make a quiet debut from the seat his mother Maneka Gandhi was vacating for him. One hate speech changed all that. Varun is now being talked of as the next Narendra Modi, the new star of the Sangh parivar. The debutant who it was thought might struggle to win his own seat of Pilibhit has been in demand as campaigner. With more TV time than most BJP leaders, he is the partys find of this election        
	Priyanka the non-politician        
	The Gandhi daughter has been in politics for 10 years, since she accompanied her mother on her first election campaign and wrote her speeches too. Starting with 1999, this is Priyanka Gandhis third general election as campaigner. Narendra Modi to Varun Gandhi, L.K. Advani to Prakash Karat  she had a stinging answer for every one of them, and the TV crew who tailed her everywhere made sure she is heard. A natural campaigner by her own admission, shes easily the most-watched and possibly the most feared by the BJP. But shes not a politician, Priyanka insists. A half-politician is all she will allow herself while the Congress continues its will she, wont she debate

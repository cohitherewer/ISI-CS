The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | South stand-off set for Delhi durbar 
                                                                                                               South stand-off set for Delhi durbar 
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Oct. 30: The BJP leadership is expected to summon the rebel Karnataka MLAs and ministers to Delhi after mediator Arun Jaitley today failed to hammer out a solution to their demand to replace chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa.        
	Sources said the Reddy brothers  ministers and iron-ore mine owners from Bellary who are behind the oust Yeddyurappa campaign  were insistent he should make way for Jagadish Shettar, the Assembly Speaker.        
	Jaitley told reporters there would not be a change of chief minister, a stance apparently taken by the partys central leadership.        
	Janardhana and Karunakara Reddy are state ministers while Somashekara Reddy is Bellary MLA. They have the backing of health minister B. Sreeramulu.        
	At the heart of the crisis are three issues: the chief ministers style of functioning that some colleagues allegedly resent, the extra-constitutional authority wielded by Yeddyurappas confidante and rural development minister Shobha Karandlaje, and the business interests of the mining lobby in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.        
	Yeddyurappa can only be accessed through Mrs Karandlaje. If we have to get work done, our requests have to be routed through her, a state MP said.        
	The lady has been compared to Kusum Rai who was once close to then Uttar Pradesh chief minister Kalyan Singh and had allegedly become a law unto herself.        
	However, a more objective view was that with his angularities, Yeddyurappa was sincerely trying to curtail the influence of the Bellary brothers who had cocked a snook at the chief minister after the recent floods and launched their private flood relief programme with the help of district officials. The officials have been transferred.        
	The view in the BJP is that the rebellion must be nipped before it consumes the party, a source said. Yeddyurappa too may be asked to drop Shobha from his ministry or ensure she keeps a low profile.        
	In the 224-member Assembly, the BJP has 117 MLAs. The Bellary brothers are allegedly trying to incite at least 40 to break away but, sources said, the fear of losing their memberships might eventually deter them.        
	The Reddy brothers are known to be close to Sushma Swaraj, who had contested against Sonia Gandhi from Bellary in 1999.

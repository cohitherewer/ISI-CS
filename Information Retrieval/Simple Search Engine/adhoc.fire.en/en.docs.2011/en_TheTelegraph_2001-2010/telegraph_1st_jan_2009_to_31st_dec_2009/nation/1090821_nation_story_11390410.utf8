The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Night for Jet officers
                                                                                                               Night for Jet officers
          SANJAY MANDAL                              
	Calcutta, Aug 20: All Jet Airways senior managers, even those not directly involved in flight operations, have been asked to work night shifts at airports as part of a plan to improve services and woo more passengers.        
	The senior officials will ensure that passenger cabins are clean, the food is of good quality and the aircraft are properly maintained while parked at airports at night.        
	The managers have to ensure there are no complaints from customers next morning when the flight takes off, an official from Jets Mumbai office said.        
	The directive, sent as an email to Jet departmental heads, says: Please work out a route for night shift involving senior managers from various departments like security, maintenance, finance, HR, sales and medical.        
	Airline sources said the directive would be implemented with immediate effect, with senior managers sitting at corporate offices required to report for night shift at the nearest airports.         
	The idea is to provide better services through intensified inspection, the Mumbai official said. Since few flights are operated at night, the officials will have enough time for inspections.        
	Aviation industry sources said the move was aimed at providing Jet an edge over competitors such as Kingfisher and the state-owned Air India.        
	In this period of stiff competition, just reducing fares is not the solution. Passengers are more demanding and they want 100 per cent in flight services, an official said.              
	Like other airlines, Jet has slashed fares. Sources said that although the number of passengers had been higher in the first quarter of 2009-10 compared with the previous year, revenues had fallen because of the fare cuts.        
	There has been a 20 to 30 per cent drop in fares and this has lead to sharp decrease in yield, an official said.        
	Jet officials said that the high crude oil prices during the middle quarters of 2008-09 hurt the aviation industry. The economic downturn reduced demand, forcing airlines to scrap unprofitable routes, cut capacity and pay, and retrench staff.

	New Delhi, June 20: The faction feud in the Kerala CPM came to the fore at the partys central committee meeting here when a state minister sought V.S. Achuthanandans removal as chief minister.        
	Kerala finance minister Thomas Isaac said Achuthanandan had defied the party line on the Lavalin case in which CPM state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan faces trial.         
	The CPMs stand has been to back Vijayan but Achuthanandan has been non-committal about toeing the line. Isaac said the chief ministers news conferences had become an embarrassment for the party.         
	Achuthanandan yesterday said the party should discuss the issue of a politburo member (Vijayan) being chargesheeted by the CBI, which has never happened before.

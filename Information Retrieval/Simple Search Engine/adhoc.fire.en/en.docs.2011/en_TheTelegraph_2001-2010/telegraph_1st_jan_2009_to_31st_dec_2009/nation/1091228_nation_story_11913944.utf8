	Patna, Dec. 27 (PTI): The Bihar government has initiated the process of declaring the Motihari house, where author George Orwell was born, a protected site.        
	The house is in a dilapidated condition...We have initiated the process of declaring Orwells house a protected site in accordance with the provisions under Bihar Ancient Monument (Protection) Act, 1976, art and culture secretary Vivek Singh said.        
	Orwell  whose real name was Eric Arthur Blair was born at Motihari in East Champaran district on June 25, 1903.        
	The state governments priority is to protect the building and other development works will follow later... The process will take around three months. Given the importance attached to the house (in picture), we will be more than willing to declare it a protected site, he added.        
	Orwell, who wrote Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four among many others, was born here when his father Richard W. Blair worked for the opium department during the British rule. A detailed report about the history of the house, its present condition and land records have been sought from the district administration, Singh said.        
	A team of experts would be sent to Motihari to assess the situation, he said.

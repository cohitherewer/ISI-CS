	The arrested Indian has been identified as Jangeet Singh, sources said citing information received from the Indian embassy in Spain.         
	Singh was arrested along with four Pakistanis in Spains eastern town of Mislata for allegedly forging passports and other documents for al Qaida, the sources said.

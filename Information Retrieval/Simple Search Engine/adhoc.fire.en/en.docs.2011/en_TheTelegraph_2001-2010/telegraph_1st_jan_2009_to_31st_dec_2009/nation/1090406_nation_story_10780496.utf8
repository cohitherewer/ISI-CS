  - Get student visas, foreign diplomats told        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, April 5: India has banned foreign diplomats posted here from studying in educational institutions in the country, altering its rules to demand that they give up diplomatic visas and obtain student visas to pursue higher studies.         
	The ministry of external affairs (MEA) has ordered that the diplomats undergo a change in their visa status and obtain a student visa to gain admission in educational courses here.         
	The ministry decision was notified to all universities and other higher educational institutions by the University Grants Commission on March 3, documents available with The Telegraph reveal.         
	The decision, approved by foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee, was taken on February 20 and educational institutions will have to ensure strict compliance, an MEA office memorandum says.         
	Top government officials at the MEA and the human resource development (HRD) ministry said the sensitive decision was taken for reasons based on arguments concerning both security and education.         
	Diplomats posted here, and their dependants, reside in India holding diplomatic visas that grant them immunity from several laws of this country.         
	They are also allowed to study at Indian educational institutions without student visas  all other foreigners can only study here on student visas.         
	Close to a dozen diplomats posted at various embassies and high commissions in India are pursuing academic courses with Indira Gandhi National Open University alone, IGNOU sources said.         
	Several young diplomats, posted here for the first time, love learning languages and pursue other academics over and above their work that has been a trend here, said a senior administrator at Jawaharlal Nehru University.         
	Diplomats posted in India are currently also pursuing PhD programmes and other research-related academic courses here, sources said.         
	Government officials argue the decision was taken after the matter was considered in detail after receiving complaints about diplomats pursuing academics here.         
	It is learnt that at least two universities complained to the government that students holding diplomatic passports had been caught indulging in illegal activities on campus, including sale of banned substances.         
	Universities also complained that diplomats who register for full-fledged academic courses  around 10 have enrolled even for PhDs  failed to meet attendance requirements.         
	They are granted admission on seats often reserved for foreign students. It is a waste of seats that could go to genuinely interested students instead, an official said.         
	But there are critical security reasons too behind the move, senior officials hinted.         
	There is no reason why students should enjoy diplomatic immunity. Diplomats come to India with the principal task of representing their country. Those who want to come and study should come on study visas, a senior official said.         
	Officials are concerned about a scenario where individuals arrive in India on diplomatic passports, enrol in courses and start living as students, slowly slipping off the radar as they enjoy diplomatic immunity.         
	When such students fail to turn up in class repeatedly, their absence could be a cause for concern.         
	Government officials also said the change in rules was in conformity with the Vienna Convention that lays down immunities that must be provided to those holding diplomatic visas in a foreign country.

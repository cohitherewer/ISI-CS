The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | UP waits for Rahul touch
                                                                                                               UP waits for Rahul touch
          RASHEED KIDWAI                          Rahul: Negotiator                                  
	New Delhi, March 4: Wanted in the heartland, Rahul the negotiator.        
	Sources said Congress and Samajwadi leaders in Uttar Pradesh were waiting for a last-minute seat-share mission by Rahul Gandhi, whose meeting with NCP boss Sharad Pawar yesterday helped the Congress make some headway during talks with its Maharashtra ally.        
	All eyes were now on the young MP, the sources said, and more so after the Congress tonight announced 24 candidates in Uttar Pradesh.        
	The Samajwadi Party, which has already named nominees in 62 of the heartland states 80 seats, is unwilling to concede more than 18.        
	Congress insiders said Rahul was expected to prevail upon his party to withdraw some candidates and, at the same time, coax the Samajwadi leadership into conceding at least four more seats to the Congress.         
	If Rahul succeeds in ending the Congress-Samajwadi deadlock, Congress leaders said he would emerge as an effective negotiator in a coalition era.        
	He is increasingly assisting mother Sonia Gandhi in crucial areas such as seat-sharing talks. It speaks highly of his leadership ability and the faith the party has in the young MP, said a Congress Working Committee member.        
	Rahuls active participation in the talks, the CWC member added, was an indicator of his growing influence within the Congress.        
	Both Rahul and Sonia figure on the list of 24 Congress nominees from Uttar Pradesh. Congress and Samajwadi candidates will clash in 10 constituencies.        
	Rahul met Pawar in Pune yesterday for over three hours, ostensibly to discuss sugarcane production. But informed sources said the two leaders also discussed seat adjustments.        
	Rahul met Pawar at the Vasantdada Sugar Research Institute at Manjri near Pune. Pawars daughter Supriya Sule was also present.        
	Congress leaders said it was at Rahuls intervention that the Maharashtra Congress agreed to consider Pawars demand for three more seats than what the party was prepared to offer.        
	Sources said the Congress and the NCP made some headway on sharing seats after the Rahul-Pawar meeting.        
	According to a Union minister who was present at the Congress-NCP talks in Mumbai last night, the two sides arrived at a consensus over 40 seats. Another round of talks will be held in Delhi within a few days, the minister said.        
	The NCP had contested in 23 of the states 48 Lok Sabha seats in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections.        
	The Union minister said the two parties would reach an agreement without further hitch.

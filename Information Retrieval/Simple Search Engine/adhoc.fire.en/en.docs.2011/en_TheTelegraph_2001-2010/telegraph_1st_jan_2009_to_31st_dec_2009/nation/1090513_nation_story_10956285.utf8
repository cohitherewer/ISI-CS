The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Red signs ignored in Dhamtari
                                                                                                               Red signs ignored in Dhamtari
          SHEENA K.                           A personnel attacked by rebels in Bastar being taken to the ICU. (PTI)                                  
	Raipur, May 12: The fact that not a single voter turned out to exercise their franchise in the April 16 Lok Sabha election in Risgaon (Dhamtari) was overlooked by polling and administration staff.        
	Had both parties examined the matter, villagers insist, they could have established that Maoists had stepped into the otherwise peaceful pocket of Dhamtari. Subsequently, Sundays rebel ambush that claimed 13 lives could have been averted.        
	According to villagers, rebels had made their entry into the Nagri-Sihawa pocket and had also called for a poll boycott that prevented residents from casting their votes. Despite zero polling, senior staff took little notice.        
	If authorities had alerted administration regarding the anomaly (zero voting), the presence of Maoists may have been detected and the police party that went for a search operation there could have marched with caution, admitted a senior police officer talking to The Telegraph.         
	The 41-member team did take their security lightly letting themselves be guided by junior staff in the rank of head constables. Their commandos were equipped with ordinary weapons.         
	The personnel travelled in vehicles (a no-no in landmine infested areas), because they were not aware of the seriousness of the situation.         
	Luckily, two grenades did not explode and our reinforcements that reached yesterday recovered them live, the officer said, adding that had they gone off, the casualty could have higher.         
	The Dhamtari ambush has established the truth that Left radicals are spreading their wings and has reached places near Raipur. Dhamtari adjoins Raipur district.         
	Home minister Nankiram Kanwar and Congress legislators, led by leader of Opposition Ravindra Choubey, today planned a visit to Risgaon separately.         
	But all of them returned from Nagri when senior officers informed them that their path ahead was dotted with landmines.

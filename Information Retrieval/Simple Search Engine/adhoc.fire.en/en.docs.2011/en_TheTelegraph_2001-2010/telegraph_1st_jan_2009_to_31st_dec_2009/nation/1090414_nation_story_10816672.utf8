          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, April 13: Ranju will remember the day when her daughter was born as the day she delivered under a tree, without a doctor around, fearing for her daughters life.        
	Her fault was that her husband failed to tip a doctor at a local community centre that made him refuse help to the young mother. Later an inquiry followed after which Abhay Kumar Das was transferred to Kandhamal and was later suspended on the basis of findings of another inquiry conducted by the Jagatsinghpur collector. And disciplinary action was taken against the doctor and a health worker, Sukanti Panda, for neglect.        
	On July 10, 2007, the couple petitioned to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) seeking compensation for the trauma caused. Prabir Das, a human rights activist, filed the petition on behalf of Ranju, the wife of Gandharba Sethi of Kujang village in Jagatsinghpur district.         
	The NHRC considered the case fit for interim relief and issued as many as three directives over the year and eight months to the state government.         
	The government, however, does not seem to believe that any damage was done.         
	The NHRC issued an order to additional secretary of the department of health and family welfare to submit a report on the delay in payment of interim relief, Das told The Telegraph today.         
	And last week the commission also sought a report on the present status of the disciplinary proceedings that was initiated against the doctor and a health worker who refused help to the couple endangering their child and the mothers lives, he added.         
	According to the petition, the accused doctor working at a Kujang centre had asked Ranju to get an ultrasound investigation done at a private clinic at Rahama.         
	After studying the report, she was advised to check herself in for delivery. At the time of admission, the doctor demanded Rs 2,000 from the couple as fees.         
	Health and family welfare department, while responding to NHRC notices, has repeated that the order has been forwarded to the general administration department.

          AJAY SUKUMARAN                          Artists paint a cricket graffiti in Bangalore. Bangalore News Photos                                  
	Bangalore, Nov. 20: If you cant beat them, join them.        
	Thats the approach the Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), the IT hubs civic body, has taken to keep walls in the city free of graffiti, posters and advertisements.        
	Instead of political slogans and film posters, the citys walls are now a window to Karnatakas cultural heritage and the corporation hopes people wont disfigure its oil-based paintings depicting the ancient temples of Hampi and Pattadakal, or the states performing arts such as Yakshagana.        
	Besides, pictures of Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid and other sport stars are coming up on the walls of playgrounds, all painted by small-time banner artists.        
	Eventually, we plan to cover most of the walls, said Bharat Lal Meena, the corporations commissioner. We have identified BBMPs own buildings and then parks, he said, adding that they would, however, focus only on main roads and not residential areas.         
	The Karnataka Open Places (Prevention of Disfigurement) Act specifies a Rs 1,000 fine or imprisonment up to six months for violators.        
	In Calcutta, some localities have managed to keep their walls free of graffiti only because residents threatened not to vote parties which defaced them.        
	An artist in Bangalore said the whole idea was flawed.        
	They are really atrocious paintings. Not only that, none of them is going to last for a season, said painter and sculptor Balan Nambiar.        
	Mosaic wall decorations may last many years, but no pigment-based colouroil, water or temperawill last more than a couple of months, he said.        
	Commissioner Meena said the corporation expected the paintings to last four to five years and also planned to have a group of artists for a periodical touch-up. He did not specify the budget for the painting project, but said it could run into a few lakhs of rupees. The artists were mostly hired and would get wages daily.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Jan. 29: Orissa High Court has initiated criminal proceedings against Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation commissioner Aparajita Sarangi.         
	She is facing contempt of court for not obeying orders regarding a solid waste disposal yard in the state capital.         
	The court had been pressing for a single-point garbage disposal system at Bhuasuni, on the outskirts of the city, since August 2007, after a PIL was filed in the matter by the pollution board. The BMC has so far apparently skirted the order despite several court directives and deadlines. Passing the order, the two-judge bench of Justice L.K. Mohapatra and Justice Indrajit Mohanty directed the Orissa State Pollution Control Board to initiate criminal proceedings under Section 15 of Pollution Control Act against the BMC commissioner, at an appropriate court. The court further directed the panel to submit an action taken report by February 11.         
	The order assumes significance as criminal proceedings, as directed, on conviction could lead to imprisonment up to seven years and penalty of Rs 1 lakh. The order was issued on the basis of a report submitted by an inquiry commission appointed by the high court to find out the reasons behind the delay in re-location of the disposal yard.        
	The registrar-general, had submitted the report after making a field visit to the 61.41-acre site provided by the government for the yard.

  - Legal laxity blamed for govt inaction          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Feeding hunger                                        
	Cuttack, May 24: At least 1.48 lakh children across Orissa still wipe floors as domestic helps, serve at roadside eateries and highway dhabas, while others are trapped in hazardous occupations.        
	Two-and-a-half years after the government banned hiring of children as domestic helps or employing them in restaurants and eateries, the law remains more or less as paper.         
	In the past 30 months, a mockery seems to have been made out of the law. While lakhs of children still work in the banned professions, engaging child labour in hazardous sectors has become a habit, said Bikash Das, the chairman of Liberated Childhood Movement, a legal advocacy group working against child labour in the state.        
	Official records assessed under the RTI by the group revealed that 160,462 children were identified across 20 districts as child labourers under the Child Labour (Prohibition amp; Regulation) Act, 1986.        
	In all, 351 prosecutions were launched against offending employers, but not a single conviction had taken place during the past two-and-a-half years, it was revealed.        
	In case of Bargarh, only 2,082 child labourers could be identified, while 37,918 of them were found in Rayagada and just 11 in Balasore, according to records.         
	Of the 3,079 child labourers detected in Angul 2,777 were found in the hazardous sector. The cities of Cuttack and Bhubaneswar were categorised as zero child labour areas.        
	Terming the findings appalling, he claimed that there were far more children working as domestic helps in restaurants and dhabas across the state.         
	There is a lack of political will and preparedness on the part of the government to implement the law. Efforts need to be directed to change the prevailing attitude of breaking laws, Das said.         
	Even though the government has taken initiatives like establishing 259 National Child Labour Project schools in 20 districts, only 11,498 were rescued and rehabilitated.         
	On their part, state labour department officials admitted that there had been acquittals in most of the 351 prosecutions initiated and over 80 were pending before different courts. Legal matters take time and conviction is the courts prerogative, a senior labour department official said on condition of anonymity.

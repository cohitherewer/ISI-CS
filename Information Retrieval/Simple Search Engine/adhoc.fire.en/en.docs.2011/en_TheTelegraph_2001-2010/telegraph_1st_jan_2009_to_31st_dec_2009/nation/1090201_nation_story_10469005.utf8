The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Debate begins over poll boss powers   Experts see row landing in court
                                                                                                               Debate begins over poll boss powers     -  Experts see row landing in court
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 31: The controversy in the Election Commission has ignited a debate on whether the chief election commissioner has the power to seek the removal of his colleagues on his own.         
	A similar question had come up in the Supreme Court earlier when petitions were moved in 2007 seeking the removal of Navin Chawla on the ground that an NGO linked to him had received development funds from MPs and hence there was a conflict of interest.         
	Poll panel chief N. Gopalaswami had then submitted before the court: It is the CECs understanding that the powers vested in him under Article 324 (5) of the Constitution can be exercised by him on information which has come to his knowledge during the course of his functioning as the CEC or on the basis of any representation filed before him by a political party or person or body.         
	In the former case, it would be an exercise of suo motu powers by the CEC, while in the latter case he would be acting on the basis of the petition or representation filed by a third party.        
	The BJP and the Samajwadi Party, which had filed the petitions seeking Chawlas removal, were quick to sense an opportunity in his words and withdrew their pleas from the Supreme Court. They would instead make a representation first to the CEC, the parties decided.         
	The case was then shelved. The BJP and the Samajwadis made a representation to the EC after that, but nothing was heard about it till Gopalaswamis suo motu recommendation to the President that has come out in the open now.         
	Legal experts are unanimous that the case would now have to be decided by the court, sooner than expected.         
	Former law minister and senior counsel Shanti Bhushan said the power to remove any election commissioner lay firmly with the government.         
	The CEC cannot recommend removal unless the government says: look here, we want to remove this election commissioner, he said. The CEC cannot give any such recommendation unless the government specifically consults him, Shanti Bhushan said.         
	Even if he submits a recommendation, the government is not bound by it, he said. What if it is biased? Should the government still accept his recommendation?         
	But another lawyer and constitutional expert, Rajiv Dhavan, said it was the CECs job to ensure that the multi-member body was kept workable.         
	If the CEC suspects that Chawla is biased in performing his duties, it is his duty to recommend his removal, Dhavan said.         
	Of course, the CEC cannot exercise the powers arbitrarily. He has to give clear and cogent reasons for it, Dhavan said.         
	President Pratibha Patil should in this case exercise her judgement independently, instead of passing it on to the Prime Minister as it would only end up politicising the matter, he said.         
	Shanti Bhushan, however, would hear none of it. All powers are in the hands of the popularly elected government. The President can only exercise it on the recommendation of the council of ministers headed by the Prime Minister, he said. Constitutional expert Fali S. Nariman also backed this position.

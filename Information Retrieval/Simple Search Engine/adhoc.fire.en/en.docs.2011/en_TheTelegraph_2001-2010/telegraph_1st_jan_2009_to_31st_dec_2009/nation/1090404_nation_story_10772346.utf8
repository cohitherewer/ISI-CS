The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | YSR poorer in power
                                                                                                               YSR poorer in power
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, April 3: One of his rivals sees him as earning crores by the hour; another claims his family has assets worth Rs 5,000 crore in Hyderabad itself. But ask YSR, and hell tell you the tale of his shrinking fortunes.        
	Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy has declared that his assets have shrunk from Rs 3,02,56,662 to Rs 33,33,365 over the past five years that he has been chief minister of Andhra Pradesh.        
	In the affidavit he filed along with his nomination for the Pulivendula Assembly seat, Rajasekhar has directly linked the fall in his money power to the closure of a mine his family owned in Kadapa district.        
	Strictly going by the figure, Rajasekhars claim may be true. But what he has not shown in the affidavit is the shopping mall he owns in Banjara Hills  his house Sri Bagh was developed into it  and the over Rs 80,000 salary he earns every month as chief minister.        
	Rajasekhar was earlier hounded by Chandrababu Naidus regime for operational irregularities at the Kadapa mine, its licence being cancelled in 2002. A company he owned, AP Carbides, was also shut down by Naidu for non-payment of dues.        
	According to Rajasekhars affidavit, his wife Vijayalaxmis assets have also shrunk in the 2004-2009 period but to a much smaller extent  from Rs 1,23,95,321 to Rs 1,01,43,122.        
	But his son Y.S. Jaganmohan, in the fray from uncle Y.S. Vivekananda Reddys Kadapa seat, has not taken a leaf out of his fathers book. He has declared assets worth Rs 61 crore; his wife Bharathi has Rs 8.48 crore in shares, cash and bank deposits.        
	Of Jaganmohans net worth, Rajasekhar said: My son has been an income tax payer even when he was studying for his SSLC. He is a successful businessman  he built the Sandur power project in Karnataka and owns Sakshi newspaper and Sakshi news channel.        
	Other entries in Rajasekhars affidavit include Rs 12,379 in cash, Rs 1,93,797 in bank deposits and another Rs 2,43,848 in savings. The chief minister apparently does not even own a car.        
	But he owns shares and bonds worth Rs 1,000 in AP Steels Limited and Rs 1,000 in Leasefin India, besides gold and diamonds worth Rs 13,03,770. His income through claims and interest is Rs 2,02,256.        
	Rajasekhar also owns 39.52 acres of agricultural land in his native Idupulapaya that is worth Rs 4,78,065, and a residential building in Pulivendula worth Rs 8,97,250, the affidavit has claimed. He has not taken any loans nor does he have dues.        
	 Naidus assets        
	Telugu Desam chief Naidu has declared a Jubilee Hills house worth Rs 9 crore, Rs 10 crore in loans and Rs 11 lakh in bank deposits. He has a bank balance of Rs 1,126 only and cash of Rs 23,400. He owns an old Ambassador.

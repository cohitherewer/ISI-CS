The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP seizes on fascist barb
                                                                                                               BJP seizes on fascist barb
          SANJAY K. JHA                                            
	New Delhi, Jan. 15: The BJP believes it has found a potent poll weapon in the Congresss criticism of corporate leaders support for Narendra Modi.        
	Party spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudy today said: The Congress suggested that Indian capitalists are becoming fascist. If they find talent in the BJP, if they find the investment climate in Gujarat encouraging, it is fascism.         
	Reminded that the Congress had not called the industrialists fascist but had said they might be supporting one, Rudy retorted: I have read the comments of the Congress spokesperson and understood its connotation.         
	The Congresss Manish Tewari had said yesterday: In 1933, the German capitalists were attracted to a fascist dictator... I do not want to go into the consequences of the episode on Germany and the rest of the world... His (Modis) entire edifice rests on the dead body of innocent people.        
	The comment came after Anil Ambani and Sunil Bharti Mittal said Modi should become Prime Minister.        
	The BJP is convinced the Congress has repeated the mistake it made before the Gujarat elections when Sonia Gandhi used the phrase maut ke saudagar (merchants of death) to describe the Modi administration.         
	Modi projected this as an attack on Gujarati pride to generate sympathy for himself. The BJP, and many in the Congress, believed at the time that Sonia had unwittingly injected a fresh lease of life into his wilting campaign.         
	The BJP thinks the comparison of Modi with Hitler will have the same effect, even though this isnt the first time it is being made. At least on one occasion, a party colleague had called the Gujarat chief minister Hitler. His government has also been accused of glorifiying the German dictator in school textbooks.        
	Still, the BJP believes the comparison will not please the Gujaratis and will gift the Sangh parivar the unifying factor it is looking for before the election. It is a serious matter. The Congress is suggesting that the corporate leaders have no conscience and they support fascism, Rudy said.        
	The BJP shrugged off the corporate leaders choice of Modi as candidate for Prime Minister. It said industry would find healthy work culture in all the states it rules, underlining that Modi was a chief minister and not a contender for the Delhi crown.         
	We are happy that our chief ministers are performing; but people elect the Prime Minister in Indias democracy and they will do that job in the next election, Rudy said.

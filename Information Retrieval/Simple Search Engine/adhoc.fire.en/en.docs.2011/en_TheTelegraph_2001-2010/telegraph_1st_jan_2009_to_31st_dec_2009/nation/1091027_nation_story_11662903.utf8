The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong beeps zero tolerance for Raja   Party options open on telecom scandal
                                                                                                               Cong beeps zero tolerance for Raja     -  Party options open on telecom scandal
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    Manmohan Singh, A Raja                                        
	New Delhi, Oct. 26: If the DMK expected any moral or political support from ally Congress for its embattled telecom minister, it was in for a shock today.        
	The Congress asked for zero tolerance on corruption and hinted that A. Rajas continuation in his job could come under a cloud if his name formally cropped up in connection with the alleged spectrum scam.        
	Party spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed said the CBI, which has raided telecom ministry offices, had not mentioned Rajas name so far and that the Congress would respond to the demands for his resignation only if he were formally charged.        
	He added that the Congress stood for transparency and probity in public life and expected its government to show no lenience on corruption issues.        
	Responding to questions about the partys expectations from the government in the context of the alleged scam, Ahmed said: The law must take its own course.        
	Although the Congress spokesperson was cautious and didnt sound critical of Raja, he didnt defend him either. Rather, the party appeared to be sending a subtle message to the government by repeatedly stressing the zero-tolerance line on corruption.        
	Ahmed, who was minister of state under Raja when the alleged scam took place, claimed he was not involved in the matter at all. My assignments were different. The spectrum files never came to me. They used to go to the cabinet minister directly.        
	Congress leaders conceded in private conversation that they were under no obligation to defend Raja. On the contrary, many of them recalled how Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had been reluctant to induct him and T.R. Baalu, also of the DMK, into his cabinet.        
	There is a strong feeling among senior leaders that the spotlight on allies in such matters only highlights the difference between the Congress and other parties. Even during the first UPA governments tenure, the Congress had never defended Lalu Prasad or Baalu when they drew the Oppositions criticism for various reasons.        
	Although Ahmed did not overtly defend Raja, he was unusually aggressive in attacking the BJP and the Left for targeting the Congress on corruption.        
	He said the BJP, one of whose presidents was caught on television purportedly accepting a bribe (a reference to Bangaru Laxman and the 2001 Tehelka sting operation), should not accuse others of corruption.        
	They want to extract political mileage out of anything without realising that their own hands are sullied. We can only laugh at the BJPs position, Ahmed said.        
	The Congress rarely takes on the Left on issues of corruption but the recent election victories appeared to have emboldened it to venture into this territory.        
	Ahmed said the CPM should clear its stand on its Kerala state secretary, Pinarayi Vijayan, who has been accused in a power scam (Lavalin), before attacking the Congress.        
	Asked if he was accusing the CPM of double standards on corruption, he said: Of course. The entire politburo and the Kerala chief minister were against Vijayan but Prakash Karat saved him. The CPM should come clean on this.

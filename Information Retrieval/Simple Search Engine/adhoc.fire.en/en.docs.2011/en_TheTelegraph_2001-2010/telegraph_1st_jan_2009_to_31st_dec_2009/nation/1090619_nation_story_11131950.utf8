The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Party and govt in need of cure   CPM leaders look at overhaul 
                                                                                                               Party and govt in need of cure     CPM leaders look at overhaul 
          JAYANTH JACOB                                     
	New Delhi, June 18: Shaken by its worst performance in the Lok Sabha elections and realising the growing impact of anti-incumbency, the CPM is planning to overhaul its party programmes, organisation and government in Bengal.         
	CPM sources said the initiatives would be set in motion after the central committee meeting, which ends on June 21. The sources said the Bengal state committee would hold two meetings to work out the contours of these plans, and it could be as early as next month.         
	A broad outline of such an overhaul was discussed at the last meeting of the state committee, which was attended by general secretary Prakash Karat and politburo members Sitaram Yechury and S. Ramachandran Pillai.         
	The party will be looking at changes in the state cabinet and the organisation  up to what extent will be clear only after the state committee goes into the matter in detail.         
	There is a view that age and non-performance should be factors for deciding changes in the state cabinet.        
	The same exercise will be conducted in CPM-led local bodies as well.         
	There is no room for complacency. We need to introspect and get our act together both in government  that includes all local bodies as well  and in the way the party works, a CPM leader said.         
	There is still a groundswell of support for the party in the state, as is evident from the percentage of votes. But we need to do our part, the leader added.         
	The CPM, which claims it got 43.3 per cent votes in Bengal, admits that some undesirable elements, and traits that crept into some leaders, at all levels, resulted in a disconnect between the people and the party.         
	We have to look into the issue of the way the leaders conduct themselves, the way they attend to peoples problems and issues, and how responsive and idealistic they are, the leader added.         
	The CPM also realises that signs of anti-incumbency after 32 years of Left rule are showing and need to be addressed.         
	It is unlikely that the Bengal CPM will raise the industrialisation pitch now.         
	Sources said definite pro-poor measures, such as rural electrification, focus on agriculture with greater attention to small and marginal farmers, infrastructure, education, health, and welfare of minorities, weaker sections and tribals, will take centre stage.

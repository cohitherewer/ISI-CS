The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tug of war for minority education champion
                                                                                                               Tug of war for minority education champion
          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, June 3: New faces, but old rivalries.        
	A turf battle seems about to begin within UPA-II, the bone of contention being who will be the champion of minority education.         
	It was an issue between former minority affairs minister A.R. Antulay and former human resource development minister Arjun Singh.         
	Now the current incumbents, Salman Khursheed and Kapil Sibal also appear to be going the same way.        
	The minority affairs ministry has prepared a dossier for the Prime Ministers Office with a detailed account of why the ministry should handle minority education.        
	This is not about a turf battle, but one should keep an open mind. If some areas can be better nurtured and serviced by placing them under minority affairs, then they should be. We will strive for the best solution, Khursheed had said after assuming charge.         
	On his part, the new HRD minister is equally keen on matters related to minority education and has already declared that improvement of educational status of Muslims is his top priority.        
	Sibal had even convened a special meeting to discuss the issue the day he took charge.        
	The minority ministry has pointed out that when the department was formed in 2006 under Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs initiative, minority education was under it, which is factually correct.        
	But a notification issued a month later saw educational affairs of religious minorities becoming the responsibility of the HRD ministry. Antulay had threatened to resign, prompting the PMO to intervene.        
	Officials say Khursheed, too, thinks minority education should be part of his ministrys responsibility. He is of the view that if the minority affairs ministry cant ensure the welfare of minority institutions, it would be reduced to play the role of a consultant, a ministry source said.        
	However, the officials added, unlike Antulay, Khursheed may not go in for a head-on collision with the HRD ministry on the issue.        
	Ministry officials said overlapping of responsibilities might lead to frictions between the two ministries, and cited the standoff over minority status for Jamia Milia University to back their argument.        
	While Antulay was for the move, Arjun Singh was against granting the status.        
	The matter reached the Prime Minister and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, but is yet to be settled.        
	Minority ministry officials say there should be a clear demarcation in the responsibilities of the two ministries.         
	Ours is a ministry which has been created exclusively for the welfare of the minorities. Then how can it be justified that even the madarsa board is being handled by other ministries, said a senior official in the ministry.        
	The fate of minority education will depend on which minister has maximum clout with the higher-ups. Last year, Arjun Singh won the battle. Lets see who wins this time, joked an official.

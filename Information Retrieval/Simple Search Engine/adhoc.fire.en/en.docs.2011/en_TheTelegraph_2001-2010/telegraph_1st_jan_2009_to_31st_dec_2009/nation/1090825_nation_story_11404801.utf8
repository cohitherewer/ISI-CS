The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Maoist arrest claim
                                                                                                               Maoist arrest claim
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 24: The Centre has claimed the arrest of two Maoist leaders, marking up their seniority far above the detentions on which the guerrillas have given a 48-hour bandh call.        
	The CPI (Maoist) and the ministry have given different names of the arrested duo. The Maoists have blamed police for the disappearance of Kartik and Anil. It is not clear where the two figure in the outfits hierarchy.        
	The home ministry source said Amit Bagchi, a central military commission member, and Shofique Mandal, a senior state-level leader of Jharkhand, were caught. The two key men are in custody. They were travelling together in a train in Jharkhand. Initially, even we did not know about the identity of the two leaders, the ministry source said.         
	It was probably the Maoists strong protest across five states, where the bandh was called today, that blew Bagchis cover. It is a big catch for the police weeks before a planned joint operation against the rebels. Bagchi is believed to be a military strategist.         
	The Centre today issued an advisory to five states, including Bengal, to be doubly alert as the Maoist bandh is expected to be more than a general strike. The rebels blew up rail tracks and bombed a cellphone tower in Latehar and Palamau districts of Jharkhand today.

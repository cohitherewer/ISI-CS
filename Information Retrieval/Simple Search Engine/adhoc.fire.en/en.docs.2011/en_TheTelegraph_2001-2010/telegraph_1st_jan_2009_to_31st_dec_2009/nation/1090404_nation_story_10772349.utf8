	New Delhi, April 3: Priyanka Gandhis father-in-law Rajinder Vadra died last night.         
	PTI quoted police sources as saying Rajinder was found hanging from the ceiling fan at a guesthouse here.        
	The body was found this morning by an employee of City Inn guesthouse in south Delhis Yusuf Sarai where he was staying for the past few days, the news agency said.        
	The police said a case has been registered and they were investigating the matter, PTI added.        
	According to sources in Max Hospital, the 65-year-old Rajinder was a patient of liver cirrhosis and was undergoing treatment. He was discharged about 12 days ago.         
	He was cremated at the heavily-guarded Lodhi Road crematorium in south Delhi at 4.30pm today.         
	The last rites were attended by Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Priyanka, her husband Robert and her brother Rahul.         
	In 2001, Roberts sister Michelle, a jewellery designer, died in a car accident. Two years later, in September 2003, his brother Richard committed suicide in Moradabad.         
	Rajinder, who had an export business of metal handicrafts, was separated from his wife Maureen.         
	The family had been estranged for seven years.         
	In January 2002, Robert had issued a legal notice in newspapers declaring he had nothing to do with his father and brother and that any attempt by them to gain favours by pretending to act on his behalf should be disregarded.

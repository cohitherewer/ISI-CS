	Patna, Aug. 17: Nitish Kumar today pressed for the urgent need of security audit on Bihars border with Nepal to check infiltration and smuggling of narcotics and fake currency at the chief ministers conference chaired by the Prime Minister in New Delhi today.        
	We have a 726km porous border with Nepal. You are aware of the political turmoil and recent activities in the neighbouring country. The disturbances there raise serious and genuine concern, Nitish said in his address.        
	There is an urgent need for security audit along our border with Nepal, he said, while admitting: We have problems of illegal infiltration, smuggling of narcotics and fake currency, human trafficking and other criminal activities.        
	According to security experts, the growth in the magnitude of smuggling in goods from Nepal to India and cross-border movement of criminal elements vis--vis an ill-equipped and inadequate security arrangements on the border have warranted upon the chief minister to ask for the security audit.        
	Security audit is a term used for re-assessment of security measures. The Indo-Nepal border have Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), IB besides the Indian customs and excise department personnel deployed on it to regulate movement of man and material.        
	Recently, the DRI and custom officials confirmed smuggling of large quantity of betel nuts from Nepal to Bihar resulting in a huge loss of revenue by way of import duty. A senior DRI official said that India had annual shortfall of an estimated over 1 lakh tonnes of betel nuts and the gutkha mafia operating on the porous border smuggled it through northern Bihar districts of East Champaran, West Champaran, Madhubani, Araria and Supaul.        
	Nepal imports more betel nuts from other countries than it actually requires and the betel nuts in excess are dispatched to India illegally, the official revealed, adding: The smugglers caught during DRI and custom raids got away without adequate punishment in absence of stringent laws and skilled security officials do deal with the crime.        
	The Wildlife Crime Control Bureau has been looking into the inter-state and international ramifications of two recent incidents of seizure of tiger skin and arrest of poachers. Recently, the SSB personnel intercepted a person while attempting to smuggle out two tiger skins and large quantity of bones on the Indo-Nepal border. The team from Wildlife Crime Control Bureau rushed to the spot for co-ordinating with security agencies to examine the organised links.        
	The team unearthed the inter-state and international linkages to the attempted smuggling. They are working closely with enforcement agencies of at least three other states to unearth the dynamics of the illegal trade activity and the kingpins involved in poaching, sources said.        
	The aides to the Bihar chief minister said that Nitish was greatly upset at the growing menace of smuggling on the Indo-Nepal border and urgently felt the need of security audit of intelligence and forces deployed there.

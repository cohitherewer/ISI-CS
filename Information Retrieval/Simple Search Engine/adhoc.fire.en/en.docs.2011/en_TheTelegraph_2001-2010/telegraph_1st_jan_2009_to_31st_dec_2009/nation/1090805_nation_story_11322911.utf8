                                                                                                               Justice is what will be acceptable in open public discussion

	Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, who is in Calcutta to deliver The Penguin Annual Lecture on Wednesday evening at Nandan, spoke to Somak Ghoshal of The Telegraph on his new book, The Idea of Justice. Excerpts from the interview:              
	Q: Why do you think that the concept of justice has become almost synonymous with human rights?        
	Sen: I think the connection between the two is very strong, and its perceptive of you to pursue that track because quite often those who dont like the idea of human rights take it to stand for nothing other than hot air.         
	If you try to defend human rights, you have to argue, as I do in this book, that the vindication of human rights comes from its acceptability as well as its non-rejectability in unrestricted public discussion.         
	Lets imagine a discussion in which somebody says, Look, you cant arrest a person and keep him without trial because youre violating human rights. Then the other person could say, Well, you say Im violating human rights but theres no law in this country against what I am doing (supposing that were the case). You could then say, There may be no such law in the country, but still its not acceptable. But unacceptable to whom? The other person could say, Well, its acceptable to me. So the argument would be, Of course, its acceptable to you but its not acceptable to the guy who has been imprisoned.        
	The question is, if theres open public discussion, which point of view will find favour? So justice and human rights are both, in some ways, parasitic on the likely outcome of an open public discussion in which information is freely available and where there is free speech. The theory of justice Im trying to present claims that the vindication of justice is based on its acceptability in open, reasoned public discussion.         
	My departure from other theories of justice, like that of John Rawls (author of A Theory of Justice), is over the content of justice. However, whether we deal with ideal institutions or with the removal of injustice, there is a meeting of minds between Rawls and me over the idea that justice has objectivity because in an open public discussion, where people are not stifled, the point of view of justice will gain acceptance. Now Rawls discusses this very well but wants to confine acceptability within a particular country. Here, I am less influenced by Rawls than by Adam Smith, who takes the view that acceptability has to be much wider.         
	Thats why Smith uses the idea of the impartial spectator, who could come from anywhere. You have to imagine somebody who is not directly involved, though well-informed, coming from another society and looking at the above situation and saying, Is it just that this person could be arrested and kept imprisoned without trial? And he could say, No, this violates acceptable norms of immunity until that person is convicted. And if he is not convicted, and not tried, then he has a right to a fair trial.         
	Mine is this Adam Smithian position. And this is the connection, I think, between human rights and justice. Of course, theres also an immediate connection: quite a lot of statements on human rights are in the form of saying that to deny a person this right would be unjust, applied to the right to free speech, or to take a different kind of example, the right to medical care. So the language of justice and human rights has something in common. But there is also a more foundational connection in that both of them are founded on the acceptability of the two ideas in unrestricted public discussion. Im sorry that was quite a long answer. (laughs).              
	Q: So what is the relationship between justice and law? Is justice then the means or the end of law?        
	Sen: I dont think it is either. I primarily take a positivist view of law; I go with the view that law is basically what has been enacted. I dont fully go by it because I also accept the views of people like Ronald Dworkin, that judges also make law by reinterpreting law. But the starting point is what has been legislated.         
	Justice is not what has been legislated but what would be acceptable in open public discussion. The law in a dictatorial country would be very restrictive in terms of what rights it gives to people. Even in a democratic country, there would be limitations. There is no law in America that would get you support from the State if you are ill, though there are laws in European countries that may take care of your healthcare. So laws vary, but the demands of justice may be less variable.         
	Law is not parasitic on justice. Somebody may pass a law saying, I know its unjust, but we need it at this time since the country is in peril. Lets take an example, where terrorists are trying to do terrible things in the country. In the process of trying to weed out the terrorists, suppose someone argues, and Im not supporting the argument, that because of this there have to be provisions for snooping on telephone calls. So, although this is unjust, we have to sacrifice the justice, and the human rights, of some people; on this ground we have to pass a law like the Pota. Once its legislated, it becomes law, but it wasnt parasitic on justice. Indeed, the author of the law might even concede that it is unjust though necessary.              
	Q: So does justice give rise to enabling conditions or capabilities, as you put it?        
	Sen: To understand this, we have to consider a general and a particular theory. The general theory says whatever claims are likely to survive reasoned scrutiny in open public discussion  and being more influenced by Smith than Rawls, Ill say open public scrutiny not confined to a particular country or culture  will have a claim to be part of justice. Theres also a more specific theory saying that if such a debate would take place, then the importance of human life and freedom will assume prominence and wide acceptance. Now the second claim is much more demanding and narrower than the first. So Id agree that capability has become a central part of a theory of justice if you accept that peoples lives and freedoms will have to feature in it. Although Id have a disagreement with someone who does not consider capability important, Id have a much more foundational disagreement with someone who says public acceptability or survival of reasoned scrutiny has nothing to do with justice.               
	Q: Would you agree that Barack Obama has revived the capabilities theory?        
	Sen: That would be a very strong claim to make. Any politician has to make priorities and policies on the basis of his personal reading of what is feasible. But theres no question that Obama has certainly put a greater emphasis on many of the basic capabilities and human rights, including healthcare and the right to a fair trial. One of the first things that Obama did was to order the closure of the Guantanamo Bay prison camp, indicating that he takes capabilities and human rights more seriously than his predecessor did. But he is not following a handbook approach nor do I expect anyone to do so.              
	Q: Would you say Obamas election to the presidency signals a triumph of capabilities?        
	Sen: I wouldnt say that though I wish I could. I dont think thats what happened. I think people were fed up with the Bush administration. Apart from the Iraq war, which I believe was a stupid war, the economy came to a crashing halt towards the end of the Bush era. Even earlier, when the economy was growing, the sharing of the benefits was gravely unequal. The rich were getting dramatically richer. There was a sense of injustice that connected as easily with inequality of income distribution as with inequality of capabilities.              
	Q: Can there be an equality of capabilities?        
	Sen: It is too much to ask for. The fact that you are egalitarian does not mean that you want equality of everything at any cost. There are also other values. You may regard the huge discrepancy between the rich and the poor to be unfair but you cannot want everyone to have the same income irrespective of some of the reasons  though not all  that might explain part of the difference in income levels, such as hard work. I think to be an egalitarian is not the same thing as giving priority to equality over everything else. In general, you may think there is a case for enhancing equality.               
	Q: What is the place of emotions in your theory of justice?        
	Sen: The theories of justice Im criticising are those concerned with the ideal of an imagined, perfectly just world. Those theories construct an ideal not in tune with living emotions. If you are debating on slavery or female subjugation and if you agree that they are unjust, then you must have had good reason to feel angry. What a perfectly just society would look like is a question difficult to get excited over. I dont regard emotion more important than reason, but we do have reason to take emotion seriously.               
	Q: On a different note, are you planning to write your memoirs?        
	Sen: A number of people are keen that I write them. I take their interest to be a sign of my old age. I remember when I was Master of Trinity, I had to sit for a portrait that now hangs in the main gallery of the college. I was initially resistant as at that time I was also sitting for another piece commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery. But then, someone gently reminded me of something called a sudden departure and I made up my mind to do it. As you age, your memories fade a bit, so perhaps this is a good time to write them down. But there is something funereal, almost obiturial, about writing even an autobiography in the first person. People could sensibly ask, well, why should we be interested in your life? I havent made up mind yet, but there is strong pressure from within the family and from my editor and literary adviser.

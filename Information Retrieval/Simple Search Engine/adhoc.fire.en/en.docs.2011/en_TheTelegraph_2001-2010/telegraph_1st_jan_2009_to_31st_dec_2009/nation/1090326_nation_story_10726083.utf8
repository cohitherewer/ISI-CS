          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Advani: Azamgarh blow                                  
	Lucknow, March 25: Azamgarh authorities today refused L.K. Advani permission for a rally later this week, nipping plans to kick off his heartland campaign from the home district of several minority youths picked up for alleged terrorist links.        
	A letter to the Uttar Pradesh BJP said permission couldnt be granted for the March 28 rally because of security reasons.        
	BJP sources saw the hand of chief minister Mayavati. They said the rally  to promote party candidate Ramakant Yadav who had switched loyalties from the ruling BSP  could have polarised Hindu votes.        
	Several youths from the district were arrested for alleged involvement in last years Batla House encounter in Delhi and blasts in Jaipur and Bangalore.         
	Sources said the authorities were worried because Advani would have campaigned with firebrand leader Yogi Adityanath, whose rally last year in Azamgarh saw large-scale violence.

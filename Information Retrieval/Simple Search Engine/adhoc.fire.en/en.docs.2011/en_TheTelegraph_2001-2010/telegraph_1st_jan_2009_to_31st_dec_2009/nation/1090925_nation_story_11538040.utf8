	Cuttack/Bhubaneswar, Sept. 24: The twin cities are facing twice the trouble before Durga Puja  Bhubaneswar artisans are rushing to meet festive deadline while Cuttack is struggling to manage traffic woes, thanks to mandaps and gates blocking roads.        
	On December 14, 2000, Orissa High Court had banned the practise of digging up roads without prior approval of Cuttack Municipal Corporation (CMC) to set up mandaps or gates. But, more than eight years into the ruling, norms are regularly flouted. The temporary structures impede traffic and damage road surfaces.         
	The high court had specified that for any such activity, parties were supposed to put up plans a month before the Puja with the CMC, so that the civic body could collect funds for restoration. Authorities could start the process only after depositing an amount and obtaining a permission. The CMC commissioner conceded that the digging does leave roads damaged. We will try to collect the funds for restoration, Lohani added.         
	Though its already Shashthi, in 100-odd mandaps in the city, labourers, craftsmen and idol-makers are hurrying up with last minute preparations vying to make their mandap the best. The crowd-puller this year promises to be Nayapalli Puja. The committee has decided to create Helven Palace of Austria with straw mats and with a more traditional gate with Oriya handicraft. It took 2 months for 40 artisans to construct the gate, mandap and the 19feet Durga.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 31: Sir, please come to our school and then we can visit Kapilas (religious centre) together  this was an invitation extended by Aradhana, a student of Sulakshana Devi High School of Dhenkanal, to chief minister Naveen Patnaik today.         
	The invitation was extended at the launch of Edusat, a satellite classroom programme introduced in 40 district schools.         
	The programme is being executed by Orissa Remote Sensing Application Centre in collaboration with Indian Space Resource Organisation.        
	This programme will enable experts to teach students miles away, while sitting at a Bhubaneswar studio.        
	It was during the launch ceremony that Naveen asked Aradhana if she had visited Kapilas, to which she said no and then extended an invitation to Naveen to visit the site together. The chief minister also spoke with 10 other students.        
	The chief minister seemed pretty popular with the students as most extended their invitations to Naveen to visit their schools. One Nafiza even reminded the chief minister that he had missed her school annual function, a mistake that the smiling CM promised to rectify soon.         
	Ready with anecdotes and questions, the BJD boss spoke on myriad topics with the little ones discussing the Prince Dance Group to Oriya literature to (surprisingly) district rainfall records.

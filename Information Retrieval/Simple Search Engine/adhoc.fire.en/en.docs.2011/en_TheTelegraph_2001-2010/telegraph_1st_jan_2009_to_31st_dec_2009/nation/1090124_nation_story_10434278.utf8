	New Delhi, Jan. 23: The BJPs prime ministerial candidate, L.K. Advani, is thinking of extraordinary measures to rev up preparedness for elections, sources said, attributing the move to discouraging internal surveys.        
	A radical idea under consideration is giving the reins of the campaign to Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi, who has been the toast of some business leaders despite the riot cloud.         
	The sources said the idea, first mooted by Advanis aides, has met with stiff resistance at the highest levels.         
	While senior leaders who are managing the campaign at the national level are wary of Modis entry, there is also a fear that other chief ministers might resent the move. The party has called a meeting of BJP chief ministers on January 29 to discuss options to bolster electioneering.        
	While the rebellion by Bhairon Singh Shekhawat and Kalyan Singh has dampened the general mood in the party, internal assessments have put the NDA nowhere near the Lok Sabha majority mark of 272. A feeling has also set in that the campaign hadnt taken shape despite an early start around six months ago.        
	The weakening of two of its major planks  terrorism and inflation  confounded the confusion, prompting a section of Advanis advisers to suggest the old trick of polarising the voters. Some sections feel there is no better agent of polarisation than Modi. Sources said the idea was discussed at the highest level.        
	But no decision could be taken as the campaign is being managed by three stalwarts  Venkaiah Naidu, Arun Jaitley and Sushma Swaraj. While Jaitley could be exploring the possibility of contesting himself from the New Delhi seat, Sushma and Venkaiah have been kept free only to manage the campaign. None of these leaders will relish the idea of being dictated by Modi.        
	Venkaiah is at present the functional head of the central election management committee. Jaitley is looking after media management and advertisement while Sushma is managing the organisational matters.         
	Sources say party chief Rajnath Singh is also not too enthusiastic about giving national prominence to Modi. He has asked Venkaiah, who used to travel a lot, to stay put in Delhi and co-ordinate the election management.        
	The party has planned to resume Vijay Sankalp rallies in February, in addition to beginning first-time voters conferences across the country. The party is also organising meetings of volunteers who joined the Advani campaign on the Internet. But despite all these activities, a section of the leadership feels the campaign lacks force and direction. They are still pushing for Modi.         
	Let him be the mascot of the campaign, standing firmly behind Advani during the campaign. We have to exploit his popularity to the hilt, a BJP Rajya Sabha MP said, conceding that he would anyway be the star campaigner.        
	But the issue of making him the overall campaign in-charge has not been closed and the final decision will be taken in the next few days, maybe at the National Council meet in Nagpur, where the election strategy will be given finishing touches.

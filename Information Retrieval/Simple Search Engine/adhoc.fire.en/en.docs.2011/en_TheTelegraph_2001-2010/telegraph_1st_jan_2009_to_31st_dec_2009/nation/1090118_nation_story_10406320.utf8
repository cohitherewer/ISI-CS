          OUR BUREAU                          Priyanka Gandhi greets Dalai Lama at a lecture on non-violence in New Delhi as Rahul Gandhi looks on. (PTI)                                        
	Mumbai/New Delhi, Jan. 17: The Prime Minister asked Pakistan to make a full and complete disclosure of all the facts surrounding the Mumbai attacks on a day Islamabad acknowledged it had received leads from India and promised a quick investigation.        
	PTI quoted Pakistan interior minister Rahman Malik as saying Delhis dossier on the Indian probe findings  till now dismissed as information, not evidence by Islamabad  contained leads and good clues.        
	Pakistani investigators will work to convert this quite a lot of material into evidence that can stand up to judicial scrutiny, Malik said, according to the agency report. He said Pakistan would complete its preliminary investigations within 10 days.        
	However, Manmohan Singh, speaking in Mumbai, appeared to voice the widespread scepticism in India about Pakistans blow-hot-blow-cold statements. He warned that Islamabads disclosure of its findings must contain no attempts at denial, diversion and obfuscation, and that Pakistan must act to ensure such attacks were not repeated.        
	Singh attended the Economic Times Awards for Corporate Excellence at the Trident hotel, which was one of the terrorists targets on November 26.        
	Although that horrific event is behind us, the scar it has left remains, Singh said.        
	I was a resident of Mumbai for three happy years, and I feel the anguish and anger of this great city. To the people of Mumbai, I can only say that we will spare no effort to ensure that their city does not suffer any such attack in the future.        
	Pakistan too should ensure that nothing like Mumbai or the attack on our embassy in Kabul ever happens again, Singh said.         
	He advised Islamabad to act against the Lashkar-e-Toiba and other terror groups and their sponsors in its own interest as well as to honour its international obligations and bilateral commitments to India.        
	His comments came a day after Islamabad made its first formal communication to India about the actions it had taken against terror groups.        
	Officials in Delhi said Islamabad had yesterday provided Indian high commissioner Satyabrata Pal with a summary of what Malik had told the media on Thursday.        
	Pakistan claims to have closed five camps of Lashkar front Jamaat-ud-Dawa, arrested 124 activists, blocked six of its websites, and closed 20 of its offices and 87 schools and madarsas. It said it had banned Dawa publications such as the monthly al Dawa and Zarb-e-Toiba, and the weeklies Ghazwa, Nane-Mujahid and al Rabita.        
	Indian officials were cautious to react. We want to see a verifiable and transparent probe leading to the Mumbai attack planners being brought to Indian justice, an official said.        
	In the past too, Pakistan has initiates such steps. We would have to know whether these are arrests or house arrests.        
	Singh urged the international community to use its full weight to make sure that Pakistan completed its probe and shut down terror groups. But he also voiced a new scepticism about the world communitys role thats increasingly creeping into Indian statements: However, at the end of the day, I recognise that this is a problem that we will have to tackle ourselves, with our own sources and our own determination.        
	The Prime Minister asked his elite audience of industrialists  who included Anil Ambani, K.V. Kamath, Arun Sarin, Sunil Mittal and Anand Mahindra  to observe a minutes silence in memory of the 26/11 victims.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tug-of-war delays BJP manifesto
                                                                                                               Tug-of-war delays BJP manifesto
          SANJAY K. JHA                               Joshi, Advani: Ideological tiff?				                                 
	New Delhi, April 1: The BJP hasnt been able to bring out its manifesto even as the campaign for the first phase of the general election peaks.         
	The delay, sources say, is mainly because of ideological confusion.        
	Party veteran Murli Manohar Joshi, who heads the manifesto drafting committee, appears to have confounded the confusion.         
	The sources revealed that Joshi adopted a rigid RSS line on vital issues, which the aides of prime ministerial candidate L.K. Advani found difficult to digest. Important aspects of the manifesto are now having to be reworked.         
	The sources say the document will be released on Friday.        
	Joshi was particularly aggressive on economic reforms and Hindutva, the sources said. He blamed the economic policy being pursued in the garb of liberalisation for the current slowdown. He argued that both the western and communist models had failed and stressed the need for a swadeshi model to suit Indian conditions.         
	Advanis aides are, however, careful not to send out the message that the BJP is anti-reforms and want to do a balancing act.         
	At the same time, the Joshi line cannot be discounted completely as both Advani and party president Rajnath Singh have expressed doubts about the efficacy of the existing economic policy and called for a new model.        
	While Rajnath had broached the topic at the Nagpur national council meeting two months ago, Advani spoke about it at the annual general meeting of the Ficci a few days later.         
	On ideological issues, Joshi talked tough, echoing the RSSs views, even as Advani preferred a softer approach.         
	Sources say Joshi, a known Advani-baiter, strongly differed with other members of the manifesto committee and drafted a four-page foreword with a tenor that was unpalatable to other leaders. He is said to have suggested that dialogue and judicial process will not be able to solve the Ayodhya dispute and promised a legislation to build the Ram temple if the BJP is voted to power.         
	Publicly, BJP leaders have denied that the manifesto delay has been caused by any conflict of opinions. They insist the draft is only being touched up by Advanis aides. But the fact is the manifesto could not be released on time in spite of Joshi having submitted the draft almost two weeks ago.        
	The Congress released its document last week.         
	The BJP is bringing a manifesto after a long time and many leaders feel the confusion could have been avoided by doing proper homework. The last time the BJP had its own manifesto was in 1998; there was only an NDA manifesto in the 1999 election and an agenda for governance in 2004.         
	A similar governance agenda was planned this time, too. A committee headed by Jaswant Singh was preparing the document. But there is no word so far on that either.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bus strike cripples Orissa
                                                                                                               Bus strike cripples Orissa
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 2: An indefinite bus strike called by the Orissa Private Bus Owners Association, coupled with incessant rain, has left passengers across the state in the lurch.        
	The bus owners  up in arms against exorbitant tax collection at at least five toll gates along the NH-5  had launched the strike yesterday, leaving passengers stranded at various termini even as the government rolled out eight special buses and two trains on different routes.        
	Over 1,400 private buses have stopped plying on NH-5 and NH-5(A), affecting major routes like Calcutta, Balasore, Paradip, Baripada, Keonjhar, Ranchi, Berhampur and Chandikhol.        
	We were here to visit our relatives during Puja. We expected the strike to end today and hoped to get a bus to our hometown in Paradip, said Pradeep Baliarsingh, who was waiting for a government bus.        
	Talks between the association and transport minister Sanjeev Sahoo last evening failed to yield any results.         
	Moreover, incessant rain, triggered by low pressure formed over the Bay of Bengal, has added to the woes of stranded passengers.                     
	Much to their worry, the Met office has forecast rain for next 24 hours. Especially, southern Orissa will experience heavy rainfall during the next couple of days, Sarat Chandra Sahu, the local Met office director, said.

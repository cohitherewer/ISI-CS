	New Delhi, March 13 (PTI): The railways and the defence ministry have joined hands to set up a modern institute where the army will impart specialised training to nearly 6,000 personnel of the Railway Territorial Army (RTA) to combat new types of crime.        
	Sources said work had started to establish the training institute in Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh, at a cost of Rs 5 crore.        
	The RTA was raised as an auxiliary force for rail communication in forward areas during active hostilities and maintenance of essential rail transportation in peacetime.         
	But as the country is witnessing frequent terror strikes, these men will be armed with the latest techniques and tactics, a source said.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	Bhubaneswar/Cuttack April 20: Repoll at a Pottangi Assembly constituency booth (under Koraput Lok Sabha constituency) failed as voters kept away due to reported Maoist threat.        
	On the other hand, voting at Bonai Assembly segment under Sundergarh Lok Sabha constituency began late as no voter turned up for several hours. Repoll was ordered at eight polling stations across Orissa today and according to schedule, polling began at 7am at Kerada Sevashram, but voters started to turn up after 11.30am, said Bonai sub-collector S.C. Mishra.        
	Finally, 200-odd voters were persuaded by the district and police officers to exercise their franchise. Out of the total 830 voters, 224 cast their votes, said Mishra, also the returning officer for the segment. Polling took place smoothly at six other polling stations, where repoll was ordered today, said sources at the office of chief electoral officer here.         
	The highest turnout was recorded (86.72 per cent) at Gunjipalli booth under Biramaharajpur Assembly segment followed by (72.94 per cent) Piplipalli polling station under Loisingha Assembly segment in Bolangir.         
	Boycott call        
	Voters of Dhinkia and Gobindpur, falling in the proposed 2MT Posco steel plant project area, will abstain from voting as a mark of protest against the shift of polling booths from villages.         
	Posco Pratirodha Sangram Samiti (PPSS)  an anti-Posco organisation in the coastal area  has given the boycott call. A fine of Rs 5,000 would be imposed on those who cast their votes on April 23, the samiti has warned. Dhinkia panchayat area has been a stronghold of anti-Posco activists, with Govindpur as the base for the movement.         
	If there could be elections in Kandhamal, why were polling booths shifted out of a comparatively peaceful Dhinkia and Gobindpur, quot; asked Sisir Mohapatra, the PPSS secretary.         
	The government had withdrawn police from the area shortly after the arrest of PPSS president Abhay Sahoo in October 2008. He has since been in jail custody. Both villages are in Balikuda-Ersama Assembly segment under Jagatsinghpur parliamentary constituency and both have had two booths each in previous elections.         
	The district administration, however, shifted the booth at Dhinkia to Trilochanpur and the two booths at Govindpur to Nuagaon. Jagatsinghpur district collector and election officer P.K. Meherdha said that the shift had become imperative to ensure peaceful election in the area.         
	Panchayat elections in 2007 had spewed violence and polling personnel were kept under custody by villagers. Consequently, the Dhinkia panchayat has had no elected representatives.        
	In fact, the 40-odd families, who tried to take part in the election process, were subsequently ostracised and forced to move out from their villages and have been living 8km from the transit camp provided by the district administration.         
	PPSS womens leader Manorama Khatua on the other hand labelled the shift as unwarranted in view of the present situation in the area. quot;We had opposed the move at a proposal stage, but the district administration glossed over it. Since now there are no booths, there would also be no votes from the area, quot; Khatua said.         
	Meanwhile, BJD candidate for Balikuda-Ersama seat Prasant Muduli were prohibited to campaign in Dhinkia and Gobindpur, by villagers, while other candidates have played it safe by staying away from the area.

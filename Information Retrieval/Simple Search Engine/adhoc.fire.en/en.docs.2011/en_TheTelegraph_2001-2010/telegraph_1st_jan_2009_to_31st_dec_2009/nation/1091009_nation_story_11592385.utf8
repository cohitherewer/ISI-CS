The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Maoists spurn PC peace plea
                                                                                                               Maoists spurn PC peace plea
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Oct. 8: The CPI(Maoist) today rejected Union home minister P. Chidambarams call to lay down arms and pursue a democratic path to peace, asserting that armed struggle against the system will continue.         
	How can peoples liberation army give up arms when the state is using arms against the people, asked the outfits spokesperson and CPI(Maoist) politburo member Koteshwar Rao, alias Kishenji. Talking to The Telegraph over the phone from an undisclosed location, he said: The politburo, our highest decision making body, has rejected Chidambarams call.        
	He (Chidambaram), it seems, Kishenji added: Is a novice when it comes to dealing with issues of mass struggle. He should know that the peoples liberation army has been at war with the oppressive state since 1967, when he had not even joined politics.         
	The rebel leader argued that the minister should first furnish details of the people who have been butchered by security forces and the Indian Army. The peoples liberation army took up arms against the arms used by the state forces, he said, arguing: Our guerrillas will abjure arms only when the state gives up the idea of using arms against its people.         
	Instead of responding positively, the leader was acerbic. Chidambaram is planning to engage the Indian Air Force and carry out bombing on the masses. And he is asking us (rebels guerrillas) to give up arms? The peoples army is ready for his air strike, he added.        
	Yesterday, Chidambaram had warned that the security forces would hit out against the Maoists till rebels abstained from violence and that the air force would take steps to protect itself from attacks in the wake of the death of inspector Francis Indwar.        
	Kishenji, however, said that the Maoists cadre would co-operate with the government in carrying out development work in hinterland. The leader also ruled out the possibility of a dialogue. Who has more arms? Peoples army or the state? he asked as a parting shot.

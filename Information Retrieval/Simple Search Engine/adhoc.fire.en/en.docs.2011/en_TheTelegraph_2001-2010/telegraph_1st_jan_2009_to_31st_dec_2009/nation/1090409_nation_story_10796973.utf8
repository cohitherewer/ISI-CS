The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | One step forward in IIM mentor plans
                                                                                                               One step forward in IIM mentor plans
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, April 8: The human resource development ministry has succeeded in convincing the Indian Institutes of Management to consider mentoring new IIMs, but the countrys apex B-schools are steadfastly refraining from any commitment yet.         
	The directors of Indias seven established IIMs today met HRD ministry officials here to discuss a possible roadmap to mentor new IIMs, months after rejecting the concept, The Telegraph has learnt.         
	The IIMs did not offer the ministry any commitment, but their very participation is being seen as the strongest hint yet that they may agree to mentoring the new B-schools.         
	Barely two hours after the IIMs ended their meet with the HRD ministry, the Indian Institutes of Technology poured out their woes over mentoring new IITs, stiffening the challenge before the HRD ministry.         
	The IITs agreed last year to mentor new institutes sharing their brand name, and six new IITs were started in this fashion in 2008. Two more IITs are starting this year, hand-held by the established IITs.         
	The HRD ministry and at least two government panels have recommended the IIMs follow suit and mentor a new league of the countrys top B-school brand.         
	But the IIMs last year rejected the proposal, arguing they could not be compared with IITs and that mentoring may require them to share their resources with the new institutes.         
	The IITs outpouring of anguish over their stretched resources today is likely to make it harder for the HRD ministry to vaporise the doubts among the IIMs, top ministry sources accepted.         
	The Telegraph had reported first, on March 21, that the IIMs were reconsidering their outright opposition to mentoring, and that the HRD ministry might soon meet the institute directors to discuss the project.         
	Todays meeting brought the HRD ministry and the IIMs at the same table for the first time to discuss possible mentoring plans.         
	Ministry officials argued they had taken significant strides towards convincing the IIMs.         
	We have told them that they can take it from us that they will not need to invest anything more than time and their expertise on mentoring the new IIMs, a ministry source said.        
	Directors of the seven older IITs, who met the HRD ministry officials this afternoon  the IIMs met in the morning  are learnt to have complained about the growing pressures on their resources.        
	Of the six IITs that started last year, three launched classes from campuses of their mentors  IIT Punjab from IIT Delhi, IIT Rajasthan from IIT Kanpur and IIT Bhubaneswar from IIT Kharagpur.         
	The IITs in Delhi, Rajasthan and Kharagpur told the ministry they would struggle to accommodate a second batch of students from the mentored institutes on their campus, in addition to their own students.         
	Temporary campuses have been identified in Bhubaneswar and Roopnagar (Punjab) where the HRD ministry hopes to shift students of these two IITs in 2009, officials told the IIT directors.         
	An IIT Kharagpur satellite campus in Bhubaneswar has been identified as a temporary campus for the new IIT. A womens polytechnic in Roopnagar is being spruced up to serve as temporary campus for the new Punjab IIT.         
	But the Rajasthan government and the HRD ministry are yet to agree on either a final location or a temporary campus for IIT Rajasthan. IIT Kanpur may have to accommodate a second batch of IIT Rajasthan students this year.

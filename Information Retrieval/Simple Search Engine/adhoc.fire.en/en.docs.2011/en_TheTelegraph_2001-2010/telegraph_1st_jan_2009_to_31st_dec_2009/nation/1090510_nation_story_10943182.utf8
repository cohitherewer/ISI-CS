The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Moily gagged till counting day
                                                                                                               Moily gagged till counting day
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                        Rahul, (below) Moily: Watch your words				                                       
	New Delhi, May 9: M. Veerappa Moily, the Congresss chief spokesperson, has become the first casualty of the conflicting signals coming out of the party on its likely post-poll allies.        
	Moily has been told to stay put in his Lok Sabha constituency in Karnataka until counting and not speak to the media. A call will be taken after May 16 whether he should continue to head the media department.         
	Janardhan Dwivedi, the general secretary in charge of the organisation, has replaced Moily, but said the move should not be over-interpreted.        
	The issue is not Moily. Since he was contesting an election and was away from Delhi, I was asked to take over the media department temporarily. When he informed me that he had returned, I asked him to resume duty. Now he has been told he would have to return to his constituency and perhaps campaign in Tamil Nadu. So the earlier arrangement is back. There is no formal notification or order to this effect, Dwivedi said.         
	Moily said he was not sacked.        
	Spokesperson Ashwani Kumar has also been told to watch his words. Kumar has waxed eloquent on alliances and government formation on television and in long interviews to newspapers, airing views not always in sync with the party line.        
	Moily and Kumar took two extreme positions that embarrassed the Congress after Rahul Gandhis news conference in which he said the party was open to forging new alliances after the elections.        
	Kumar, a junior minister, described the ADMK, Telugu Desam and the Janata Dal (United) as secular parties.         
	On the other hand, Moily said Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar thinks too much of himself and will regret staying with the BJP. He stressed that Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan had no reason to be angry with the Congress. We should be more angry (with them). We never wronged them, Moily added.        
	Kumars remarks upset the DMK as well as the Tamil Nadu Congress in the run-up to polling and home minister P. Chidambaram was forced to publicly clarify that the Congress never regarded the ADMK as secular.        
	Congress sources said Sonia Gandhi and Rahul had taken note of the divergent reactions and decided the loose cannons, firing from all sides, should be silenced. Rahul, who has plunged into the thick of alliance-making, felt that at this delicate juncture, neither existing nor prospective allies should be antagonised.        
	While Sonia might have let off the bumblers with a mild censure, Rahul wanted a message to go down the line that spokespersons should speak in one voice and take their cue from a nodal authority in Delhi, the sources said.         
	Spokespersons were, therefore, told to speak in measured language, desist from personal attacks and stress on one phrase  hriday parivartan (change of heart). This means the Congress is ready to embrace those parties who were once with the BJP but are now ready to part ways with it, a source said.        
	Dwivedi said today: Whoever wants to come to us has to snap ties with the BJP.         
	As long as the JD (U) was with the NDA, it was not secular, he said.        
	On the Telugu Desam, he said: The TDP was with the NDA. For five years, the Andhra Congress fought against it. We are not going to give it a clean chit.

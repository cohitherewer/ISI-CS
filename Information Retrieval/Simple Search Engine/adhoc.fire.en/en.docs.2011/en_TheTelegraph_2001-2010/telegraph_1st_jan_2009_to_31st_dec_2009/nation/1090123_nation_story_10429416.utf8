	Mumbai, Jan. 22 (PTI): A.R. Rahman, who has won three Oscar nominations for Slumdog Millionaire, today said he felt on top of the world.        
	I did not think it will get there. God has been really kind. And I have to really thank the prayers of all the people and their good wishes, the composer said. Something good is happening and I am really happy about it.        
	Rahman, who has won a nomination for original score and two for original song, acknowledged lyricist Gulzars contribution to the music. Gulzar wrote the lyrics for Jai Ho, one of the songs nominated.        
	Director Danny Boyle said: Its unbelievable... the result, 10 nominations for the film and specially the three for Rahman.        
	All of the Slumdog team responded in much the same way.        
	Actor Irrfan Khan, who plays a police inspector, said: I am elated. It is unbelievable. I dont know how to react. It is like we have won a lottery.        
	He was confident Rahman would win. The awards will be announced on February 22.        
	Anil Kapoor, who plays game show host Prem Kumar, said: It is unbelievable... we are so happy like the entire country has been nominated. The film gave India the platform to show the kind of talent India has.... Now we must grab the opportunity instead of getting petty and narrow-minded.         
	Model-turned-actress Freida Pinto, who plays the love interest of the protagonist, said: The feeling is beyond words. 10 Oscar nominations! Its unbelievable.        
	Co-director Loveleen Tandon said: It has really opened new doors for us and I am happy that Slumdog... became the vehicle for it. It is high time that the West woke up to Indian talent.

                                                                                                               AI suspends brawl duo 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AMP; PTI                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 6: Air India today suspended the co-pilot and the purser involved in Saturdays mid-air brawl over disparaging remarks allegedly made to an airhostess.        
	Capt Ranbir Arora and purser Amit Khanna, already derostered, have been suspended after an internal investigation into the incidents on the Sharjah Delhi flight, an official of the state-run airline said.        
	The pilot and the flight purser, who had been derostered earlier, have been suspended, the official added. The commander of that flight, Capt Aditya Chopra, and air hostess Komal, who has accused the two pilots of molestation, had also been derostered.        
	Sources at the Indian Commercial Pilots Association alleged the airhostess had misbehaved with the pilots, triggering the scuffle. Airline officials dismissed as irrelevant the police complaint of the air-hostess, who had yesterday approached the National Commission for Women (NCW). Any action, they said, will be based on the internal inquiry.         
	The womens commission today set up a five-member panel to probe the allegations and asked it to submit its report within a month.         
	They (the members of the committee) will talk to all those involved in the incident as well as the passengers of the flight, NCW chairperson Girija Vyas said.        
	But Shailendra Singh, the pilots association chief, defended the two pilots at a news conference here and said a certain hierarchy has to be maintained to run any aircraft successfully. The remarks appeared to suggest the cabin crew were to blame for the fracas at the cost of the planes safety. The association, he said, reserves the right to appeal Aroras suspension and will take a decision after the probes by Delhi police, Air India and the Directorate-General of Civil Action are over.        
	Despite whatever happened, the pilots maintained their cool and operated the flight from Sharjah to Lucknow to Delhi, Singh said.        
	Defending Arora, who allegedly pushed the airhostess out of the cockpit during the scuffle in which she sustained injuries, Singh said: What would a commander do if someone was not obeying his command to leave the cockpit? It was done keeping in mind the safety of the flight and the passengers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Staff strike shadow on Nitish plan
                                                                                                               Staff strike shadow on Nitish plan
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, Jan. 13: The indefinite strike by 3 lakh government employees has cast a shadow over the ambitious Vikas Yatra of chief minister Nitish Kumar.        
	Important government establishments like treasuries and registration offices across districts still wore deserted look, as the strike entered its seventh day today. The transaction of land and property has become virtually impossible causing huge loss of revenue to the government, besides causing inconvenience to people at large.        
	The worst victim of the strike would probably be Nitish, as several employees would be necessary to make Vikas Yatra  starting January 19  successful across the state.         
	The non-gazetted employees will constitute the main machinery for putting up camps, moving file and register peoples complains, said an employees union leader, hoping: The chief minister will concede to our demands to end the strike ahead of the Vikas Yatra.        
	The government employees went on strike on Wednesday, demanding full implementation of the Sixth Pay Commissions recommendations after their talks with deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi failed.        
	Modi wanted the employees organisations to accept payment of arrears with effect from April 1, 2007, while the employees insisted on payment with effect from January 1, 2006, as recommended by the commission.         
	The functioning of Patna Medical College, Nalanda Medical College, and other hospitals stood paralysed.         
	The employees disdainfully ignored the no work no pay threat from the chief secretary. The threat and policy to divide us will not work, said Bihar State Non-gazetted Employees Federation (Gope group) general secretary Rambali Prasad.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Record price tag for onion
                                                                                                               Record price tag for onion
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Oct. 6: The wholesale price of onion peaked at a new high of Rs 2,500 per quintal at Chhatra Bazaar here today, as its arrival touched rock bottom at the largest vegetable mandi in Orissa.        
	According to Chhatra Bazaar Byabasayi Sangha spokesperson, only one truck load (each carrying 100 quintals) of onions reached this morning with an average procurement rate ranging between Rs 2,200 and Rs 2,500 per quintal. The better quality onions cost Rs 2,500 per quintal.        
	Chhatra Bazaar handles over 3.55 lakh quintals of onions per annum. Arrivals, under normal circumstances, range from six to seven trucks and during surplus time, up to 10 trucks.        
	Since the April-May crop stocks from Nashik had been exhausted, the mandi is dependent on onions from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh till the fresh crop is harvested in Maharashtra. But arrivals have dipped to an alarming low following torrential rains followed by floods. The supply chain remains snapped after road communication had been cut off at several places in Karnataka. The new crop from Nashik is expected around January. We have very little to do with the spiralling price as procurement cost is going up, association secretary Debendra Sahu said. State food supplies and consumer affairs minister Sarada Prasad Nayak said: The government is keeping close watch on the situation.

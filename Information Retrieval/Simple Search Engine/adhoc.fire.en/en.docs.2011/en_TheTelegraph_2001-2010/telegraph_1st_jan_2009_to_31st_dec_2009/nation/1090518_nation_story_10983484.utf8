The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Digvijay the star winner
                                                                                                               Digvijay the star winner
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Digvijay                                  
	New Delhi, May 17: Almost every general secretary in Sonia Gandhis team has emerged on the winning side this election  Ambika Soni in Rajasthan, Mohsina Kidwai in Punjab and Kerala  she also initiated the alliance with the Trinamul Congress in Bengal  and Prithviraj Chavan in Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir.        
	But Digvijay Singh is the man of the moment at the Congress headquarters on 24 Akbar Road, where the partys best performance in two decades is still sinking in.         
	In Uttar Pradesh, the Congress has shot up from bottom to second place  at 21 seats, its tally is two short of the Samajwadi Party and one ahead of the BSP. The BJP is a poor fourth at 10.        
	The stunning verdict has put Digvijay ahead of his colleagues on the performance scale. Digvijay, however, cant hope to be the first among the general secretaries since that is a place reserved for Rahul Gandhi, whose ear he has had as Uttar Pradesh in-charge.        
	When Rahul decided to focus on Uttar Pradesh after Mayavati won most of the seats in the 2007 Assembly polls, he started virtually from scratch.         
	Past state presidents, appointed by Delhi, hadnt bothered to find an address in Lucknow where the workers could meet them. They parked themselves in hotels and guesthouses. The general secretaries seldom visited.        
	Digvijay, as a leader from neighbouring Madhya Pradesh, was familiar with the cut-and-thrust of heartland politics. But Lucknow was not Bhopal. Uttar Pradesh had been convulsed by the politics of mandir and Mandal, resulting in the Congress being squeezed out by the regional parties and the BJP.        
	A Rajput, Digvijay sensed that the upper castes, especially the Brahmins, were uneasy with Mayavati. Rita Bahuguna Joshi, a Brahmin, was therefore appointed the state unit president.        
	He also figured that Muslims were getting restive about Mulayam Singh Yadav, so Muslim leaders and workers were tapped to reconnect with the community.        
	Rahul and his team were in touch with him throughout.         
	When Digvijay spoke out against an alliance with the Samajwadi Party again and again, it was evident he had a nod from the top. Rahul had voiced the ekla chalo view in 2007.         
	Victory was sweet and the icing on the cake was the defeat of his brother Laxman, who had crossed over to the BJP and whose election wins from his home turf Rajgarh in Madhya Pradesh set tongues wagging in the Congress.

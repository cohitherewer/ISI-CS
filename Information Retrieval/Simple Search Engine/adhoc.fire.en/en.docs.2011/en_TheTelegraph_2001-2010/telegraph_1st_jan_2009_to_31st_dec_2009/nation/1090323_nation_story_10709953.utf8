The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Batting now: blame game   Modi fires barb, Cong hits back
                                                                                                               Batting now: blame game     -  Modi fires barb, Cong hits back
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Narendra Modi: Buckling?                                        
	New Delhi, March 22: Narendra Modi today accused the Centre of buckling before terrorists after the IPL was shifted out of India, but the Congress alleged the chief minister himself had buckled no less.        
	Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA) president Narhari Amin, who is a Congress leader, claimed Modi had refused to allow any IPL match in Gujarat in April.        
	Amin said Modi had informed him he could not provide security until polling ended in Gujarat on April 30, and asked him to postpone the two or three matches slated for April.                    
	How can he now accuse the Centre and the Congress of political motives? Amin asked.        
	Modi and Arun Jaitley today spearheaded the BJPs soft-on-terror line against the Congress. If they cannot provide security for 11 players, how will they be able to protect the 111 crore people of India? Modi asked, describing the IPLs forced shift as a national shame.        
	The reputation of India as a safe country has been shattered today, Modi said in a statement. He added that all future sporting events in the country had now come under a cloud, including next years Commonwealth Games in New Delhi.        
	Jaitley, a BJP general secretary, said: A domestic tournament has also to be shifted to foreign soil? It was always said Pakistan was unsafe. This non-co-operation of the Centre is clubbing India with Pakistan.        
	The IPL, he said, was the first global sporting brand India had developed. We must not dilute this brand in the second year itself.        
	So far, the Congress doesnt seem rattled. Party sources claimed the Election Commission had told the Centre that polling and the IPL could not take place simultaneously because security considerations were paramount.        
	Obviously this is not something we can shout from the rooftops, a source said.        
	Chief Congress spokesperson Veerappa Moily denied that Congress-ruled states had failed to co-operate with the IPL organisers unlike BJP governments.        
	It was (Karnataka chief minister) Yeddyurappa who was the first to say no because of security reasons. The EC controls the administration and police during an election. The chief ministers cannot take a call on anything. So we understand the Karnataka chief ministers concerns more than the BJP does.        
	Rajasthans Congress chief minister Ashok Gehlot, whose government has been accused of targeting IPL boss Lalit Modi, criticised the league organisers for denying Indian fans a chance to watch the tournament at first hand.        
	The IPL representatives have to take the blame. They should understand what is more important to the people, Gehlot said.        
	Congress ally Lalu Prasad made light of the controversy, saying: My son (Tejaswi represented Delhi in junior tournaments) also expects to play in the IPL. If he doesnt get a chance, at least he will have an opportunity to serve water to the players.        
	Junior home minister Shakeel Ahmed said it was unfair to blame the Centre considering the help it had provided the league organisers last year.        
	It is only because there is a threat perception that the Centre has responded the way it has, he said from Madhubani. They (Modi and Jaitley) are politicising a purely administrative matter.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Gowda bias slur eases out judge
                                                                                                               Gowda bias slur eases out judge
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 9: Former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda has got a Supreme Court judge to withdraw from a politically controversial case, suggesting he may be subconsciously biased.        
	The Janata Dal (Secular) leader today filed an application asking Justice Arijit Pasayat, who had rapped him at the previous hearing, to recuse (withdraw) from the case. The judge did so but not before the two-judge bench had dubbed Gowdas move unfortunate.        
	It is up to a judge himself to decide such applications, but the convention is to withdraw.        
	The case relates to the Rs 2,250-crore Bangalore-Mysore corridor project, which Gowda wants to stall. He had sent booklets and letters to high court judges alleging corruption by promoter Nandi Infrastructure Corridor Enterprise.        
	When the high court asked the state ombudsman to probe the allegations, the company appealed in the apex court. At the last hearing, Justice Pasayat had said: We disapprove of people writing letters to judges on pending matters.        
	We may commit mistakes. If our judgment is wrong, we may also be criticised. But we cannot be influenced. If you are trying to do this, its contemptuous.        
	Today, Gowda suggested reasonable apprehension that the judge may have subconscious feelings to feel aggrieved by the booklets and was likely to be biased.

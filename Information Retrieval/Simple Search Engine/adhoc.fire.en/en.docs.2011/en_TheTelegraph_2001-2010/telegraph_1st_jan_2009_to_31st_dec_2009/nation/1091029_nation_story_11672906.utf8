          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 28: The CPM today sharpened its attack on Trinamul chief and railway minister Mamata Banerjee, accusing her of playing a part in the hijacking of the Rajdhani in Bengal.        
	Speaking to reporters on the issue here, politburo member Sitaram Yechury said: The matter calls for a probe. The finger of suspicion for the incident points to Mamata Banerjee. One of the ministers from her very own party went on record saying that he had prior information about the attack.        
	Even the Maoist leader the attackers wanted freed is a former Trinamul member, he added.        
	CPM general secretary Prakash Karat said it was well known that the Trinamul Congress and its leadership had opposed police operations in Lalgarh. In fact they asked for the recall of central paramilitary forces.        
	The Trinamul Congress today accused the Bengal government of failing to act on intelligence warnings that Maoists could attack a train, suggesting that the CPM chose not to prevent yesterdays blockade of the Rajdhani.         
	Minister of state for rural development Sisir Adhikari claimed he had on Monday warned the West Midnapore administration of the possibility of a Maoist attack on a train in that region.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 17: Sanjay Dutt wants to contest from Lucknow, but three Lucknow lawyers dont want him.        
	The trio today petitioned the Supreme Court not to use its discretionary powers to suspend the actors conviction under the Arms Act and enable him to contest elections, as it had done in former cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhus case.        
	In that case, the appellant was convicted for a rash and negligent act. But in the garb of that order, other hardcore criminals found guilty of abductions, murders and extortions are getting suspension of their conviction... and are contesting elections... the petition said. In 2007, the court had stayed Sidhus conviction in a road-rage case to enable him to contest from Amritsar.        
	Petitioners Hanuman Tripathi, Krishna Saran and Alok Saran said misuse of the order would make Section 8 of the Representation of the People Act  intended to shut out criminals, terrorists and people with a criminal bent of mind from legislatures  completely futile and redundant.        
	They said the court should pass orders to  save our democracy from becoming a tool in the hands of criminals.

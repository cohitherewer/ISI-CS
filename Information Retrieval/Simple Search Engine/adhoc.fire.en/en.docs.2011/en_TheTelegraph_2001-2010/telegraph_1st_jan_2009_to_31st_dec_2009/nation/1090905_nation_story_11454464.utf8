The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Army chief flashes Pak sneak-in alert
                                                                                                               Army chief flashes Pak sneak-in alert
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Deepak Kapoor                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 4: Pakistan has started pushing militants into Jammu and Kashmir to disturb the hard-won stability in the state, army chief General Deepak Kapoor warned today.        
	His alert coincides with recent intelligence reports hinting that the neighbour had begun to encourage, like in the past, infiltration through the international border and the Line of Control before the onset of winter.        
	This period is crucial because we have a stable situation in Jammu and Kashmir, so attempts will be made by the other side to push in as many infiltrators as possible, Kapoor said on the sidelines of a programme to launch post-retirement career options for army personnel.        
	The statement comes at a time separatists have attempted to not only stoke mass protests, such as those over the Shopian rape-and-murders, but also tried to turn public opinion against the armed forces.        
	One pointer to the concern over the situation is Omar Abdullahs frequent discussions with Union home minister P. Chidambaram. The Jammu and Kashmir chief minister has met Chidambaram at least thrice in the past few weeks.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, too, has highlighted the worry in recent weeks, saying Pakistan has renewed attempts to destabilise the region.         
	Today, Kapoor appeared to echo the concerns, saying disturbances in Kashmir were likely to continue. An indication of that came this week. On Wednesday, the army shot down five militants trying to sneak in from the Valleys Gurez sector. Intelligence sources have warned of more such infiltration attempts.        
	Saeed proof        
	New Delhi today rejected Islamabads claim that adequate evidence was not available to prosecute Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed in the Mumbai attacks.         
	Official sources said Pakistan had already admitted that the 26/11 attacks were planned and executed by its nationals from its soil, and hence should have information about them. We are only assisting that process, a source said.

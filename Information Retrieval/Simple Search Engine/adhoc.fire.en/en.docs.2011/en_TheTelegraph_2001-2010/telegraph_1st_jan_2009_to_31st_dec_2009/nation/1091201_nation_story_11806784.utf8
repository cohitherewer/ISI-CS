The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Corruption accused gets a taste of corruption
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Corruption accused gets a taste of corruption
                            
	A man posing as a well-connected Enforcement Directorate officer who told Madhu Koda he could bail him out for Rs 10 crore was nabbed by sleuths in Ranchi on Monday, hours after the department arrested the former chief minister from his home in Chaibasa.        
	Thane resident Vipul Joshi was apprehended soon after his flight from Mumbai landed at Birsa Munda Airport around 12.40pm.        
	Joshi had been in touch with a close aide of Koda for the past several days. He had assured the aide that he had connections in Mumbai and Delhi and could sort out matters concerning the former chief minister.         
	In return for his services, Joshi demanded Rs 10 crore in two equal instalments.         
	The first was to be paid to him immediately, the other once the job was done.        
	Unfortunately for Joshi, Kodas aide got in touch with IG (vigilance) M.V. Rao. A cellphone trap gave away the impostor sleuth.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 21: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has slammed both Bal and Raj Thackeray for their obsession with Marathi manoos, or sons of the soil, and insistence that only Marathi should be spoken in Maharashtra.        
	It said that Raj was basically doing what his uncle had in the 60s and 70s, the difference being that while the senior Thackeray had attacked south Indians, his nephew was targeting those from the north.        
	An article in the latest issue of the Organiser (November 22), the Sanghs in-house journal, also attacked the secular and progressive Congress for encouraging the Shiv Sena earlier and now Rajs Maharashtra Navnirman Sena.        
	The sub-text of the Sanghs criticism of regional chauvinism is it runs counter to its concept of one nation, one people, one language  it is chary of adding one religion these days  or cultural nationalism.        
	The article warned that the recent attack on Samajwadi Party legislator Abu Azmi for refusing to take oath in Marathi was a mere indication of things to happen in (the) future if this diktat of Raj was ignored.        
	More disgusting and irritating was the silence of the protectors of democracy and secularism sitting on the treasury benches. It was in a sense repeating history, Virag Pachpore, the author, said.

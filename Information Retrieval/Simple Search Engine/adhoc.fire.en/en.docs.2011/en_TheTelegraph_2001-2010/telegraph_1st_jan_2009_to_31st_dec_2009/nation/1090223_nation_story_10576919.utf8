	London, Feb. 22 (PTI): Britain will introduce new immigration restrictions on professionals from India and other non-EU countries so that existing jobs are first offered to local residents.        
	From April, the basic requirements to enter Britain under the Tier 1 category of the points-based immigration system will be raised. The qualification and minimum salary level for Indian and non-EU professionals will be raised to masters degree and 20,000.        
	Currently, an undergraduate degree and 17,000 are required.        
	Home secretary Jacqui Smith is expected to announce the new rules soon as part of a 10-point plan aimed at cutting immigration levels by next year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Swine flu shadow on Haj
                                                                                                               Swine flu shadow on Haj
          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 14: Swine flu has struck Haj.        
	The Haj Committee of India has directed pilgrims above 65, below 12 years and pregnant women to avoid the trip because of the pandemic.        
	This will force out almost half of the 150,000 people who have signed up for the pilgrimage, the first batch of which leaves in October-end.        
	It is an advice jointly from the Government of India and the committee, said Hasan Ahmad, the acting chairman of the Haj panel. Haj is one of the largest human gatherings and hence prone to contagious diseases like the flu, he added.        
	The directive is also in tune with the instructions of the Saudi Arabia government, which has diagnosed over 300 H1N1 cases and recorded two deaths. Oman, Tunisia and Iran have come out with similar directives for Haj pilgrims.        
	But, with just over two months to go, Indian authorities may find it difficult to select replacements. The entire process of picking another 75,000 pilgrims must start afresh.        
	Religious leaders arent happy. God knows how to protect his people against such evil (flu). Moreover, it is a great reward from Allah to die while or after performing Haj, said Badaruddin Jamal of Mushawarrat, an umbrella body of Muslim organisations.        
	The Haj curbs came on a day four more persons died from the flu in India taking the toll to 26.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | State deadline first: Ministers
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      State deadline first: Ministers
          SANJAY K. JHA AMP; G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                       A student demonstration for Telangana at Osmania University in Hyderabad on Monday. (PTI)                          
	New Delhi/ Hyderabad, Dec. 28: Congress ministers from Telangana today turned down the high commands request to withdraw their resignations, asserting that the Centre should first come out with a time frame for creating a separate state.        
	We wont take back our resignations till the high command acts within a time frame for the formation of Telangana and clarifies doubts over the second statement of home minister P. Chidambaram last week, said state civil supplies minister J. Krishna Rao after a meeting with Andhra in-charge M. Veerappa Moily and Sonia Gandhis political secretary Ahmed Patel. The second statement had said wide-ranging consultations were needed on the statehood.        
	Ponnala Lakshmaiah, also part of the group camping in Delhi for the past two days, said they were in the capital to fulfil peoples aspirations of Telangana, not to protect our posts. The group also met Union ministers Jaipal Reddy, who is from Andhra, and Pranab Mukherjee.        
	Rao said the ministers had told the leadership that further dilly-dallying would complicate the situation. We hope that the high command and party president Sonia Gandhi will understand the sentiments of the people. Raos colleague J. Geeta Reddy said Chidambarams second statement had confused all of us about when the statehood process could begin.         
	As the ministers kept up the pressure in Delhi, statehood spearheads in Hyderabad announced more protest plans. The joint action committee (JAC) of political parties led by the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) declared its support to a January 3 convention of students at Osmania University, which has become a staging post for the Telangana agitation. Organisers expect a gathering of five lakh. The plans came even as police swooped down on the campus, taking away 20 students on hunger strike to hospital.        
	But, in a sign of the cracks within the JAC, panel member and Congress MLA K. Jana Reddy said only his party could help achieve Telangana  seen as a move to keep the TRS and the Telugu Desam from hijacking the agenda. He also said the committee should not provoke students or activists to hit the streets but wait for the right announcement from Delhi.                    
	Separately, the TRS warned of shutdowns, put on hold because of Christmas, if statehood plans were not spelt out. If the Centre does not announce the time frame by January 2, we will launch an indefinite bandh, TRS spokesperson E. Rajender said.

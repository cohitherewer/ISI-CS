          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 19: The NCP has slammed the Congress for its haphazard decision on the creation of Telangana and accused the ally of robbing credit for farm loan waivers.         
	In draft resolutions likely to be adopted at its fourth national convention tomorrow, Sharad Pawars party also held the Congress partly responsible for its recent electoral decline.         
	The NCP lost five Lok Sabha seats in the elections earlier this year because of rug-pulling by the Congress, one of the resolutions said.         
	The documents  discussed today by the partys working committee, headed by Pawar  will be unveiled tomorrow.         
	A draft political resolution accuses the Congress of triggering a political crisis with the manner in which it announced the creation of a separate Telangana state.         
	The NCP does not agree with the approach of deciding things in a haphazard manner, it stated, but also clarified that the party was in favour of creating small states  including Telangana  after consensus.         
	The document demanded that the Centre constitute a second state reorganisation commission to evaluate all new demands for statehood purely on the merit of their viability as separate entities.         
	A draft organisational resolution was more stinging. It credited Pawar, who is the Union agriculture minister, with the Rs 71,000-crore loan waiver announced last year for debt-ridden farmers, which the NCP believes helped the UPA return to power. The document said the Congress took advantage of the achievements our president (Pawar) had made in the agriculture sector.         
	At the meeting of the working committee, NCP leaders accused the ally of claiming the farm loan waiver scheme as its own, sources said. The draft organisational resolution said the alliance politics (with the Congress) did not give us good dividends.         
	In Maharashtra, where we won eight seats, we lost five, including two sitting seats, because of the rug-pulling activities of our partner. The experience in Goa and Bihar have also not been different, the document said.         
	The NCP and the Congress fought the Lok Sabha elections together in Maharashtra, Goa and Bihar. The two are also partners in the Maharashtra government.         
	The political resolution hinted at the NCPs unhappiness with the Congress not forming a co-ordination mechanism for discussions between central allies.         
	The NCP and Trinamul Congress have demanded a co-ordination committee of all allies, along the lines of the UPA-Left coordination committee during the Congress-led governments first tenure.

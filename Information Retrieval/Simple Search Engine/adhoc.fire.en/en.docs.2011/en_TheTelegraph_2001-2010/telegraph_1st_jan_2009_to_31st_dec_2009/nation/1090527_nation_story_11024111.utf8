          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, May 26: An unidentified woman committed suicide inside the Jagganath Temple in Puri last night.        
	Due to the death, security within the temple premises have come under the spotlight, as none is allowed to stay inside the temple in the night.         
	Daily rituals were delayed by more than four hours, as the temple was purified after the discovery of the body in the morning.         
	The body of the 55-year-old was found hanging from the ceiling of a wooden structure in the usually desolate Koili Baikuntha, the temple garden this morning.         
	It was presumed from the condition of the body that she committed suicide last night, said Singhadwar police station inspector Arun Dalei while talking to The Telegraph.         
	The deceased is yet to be identified, he added.         
	The 12th century temple is usually guarded by 500 temple police every day.

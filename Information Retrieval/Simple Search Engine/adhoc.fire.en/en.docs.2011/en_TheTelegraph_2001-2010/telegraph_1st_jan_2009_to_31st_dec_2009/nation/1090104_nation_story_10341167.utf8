The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Reasons for murder: goat amp; papad
                                                                                                               Reasons for murder: goat amp; papad
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 3: Mohamed Abdul was pummelled to death by his neighbours. His fault: the 65-year-old had tied his goat in their compound in south Delhi.        
	That was on July 30.        
	Less than two-and-a-half months later, on October 12, Mohammed Sahid, head cook in an east Delhi eatery, was killed when some diners turned on him with kitchen knives after an argument over serving papad turned ugly.        
	Indias killowatt capital? On a short fuse, certainly.        
	Murders after sudden provocation are on the rise, say city police who revealed at their annual news conference yesterday that 17 per cent of 518 killings in the capital last year were over petty issues. The figure for 2007 was 14 per cent of 569 murders.        
	Police commissioner Y.S. Dadwal said that in 2008 more people had been killed for trivial reasons than in organised or pre-planned crimes.         
	A quarrel while playing gully danda led to the death of a person. One man killed his sister-in-law for not washing his clothes. If thats not enough, a security guard killed his colleague for not relieving him on time and a dhaba owner was murdered because water fell on the clothes of the accused. These are some petty reasons for which Delhiites killed each other. Criminals were involved only in 10 per cent of murder cases, he said.         
	Psychiatrists said they were not surprised. This is part of the frustration, aggressive syndrome that urban living entails. The race for survival is such that no one wants to spare an inch. There is complete lack of understanding for sentiments of others, said Dr Jitender Nagpal.        
	The economic change, and the parallel change in lifestyles, are also contributing to this trend. People lack control over their impulses; they are pre-occupied with the need to survive. Both sides are reactive, thus the violent situation.        
	Police officers agreed with what Nagpal said. On Abduls murder, they said, the accused, Omar, and his wife had tried to reason with the victim that his goat was littering the compound. But an enraged Abdul had refused, leading to the fatal thrashing.        
	Officials investigating the case said Omar could easily have been the victim instead of Abdul.         
	People are no longer able to hold back their anger. Therefore, there has been a steep rise in cases of road rage, too, over the years. Escalation of anger to homicidal points, from where one cant retrace his path, is on the rise. This is because the urban population has to deal with more frustrations and has no outlet to vent them, said psychiatrist Rajat Mitra.        
	Its not just the accused who is at fault, the provocation also comes from the other side. This is because the explosive rage is mutual.        
	Police sources said passion killings, too, had contributed to the rising number of murders triggered by sudden provocation. Petty disputes over property accounted for 11 per cent of the killings last year; differences among family members accounted for 9 per cent; and old enmity 8 per cent.        
	Experts said the numbers could rise if the problem was not nipped in the bud. In the US, anger management skills begin early. People are taught to hold back, Mitra said.        
	Nagpal advocated teaching school kids life-skills so that they learn early how to control their anger.

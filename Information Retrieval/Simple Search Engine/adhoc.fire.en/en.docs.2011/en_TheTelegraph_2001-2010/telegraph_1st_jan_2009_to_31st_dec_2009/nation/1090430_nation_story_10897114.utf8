          SANJAY MANDAL                               
	Calcutta, April 29: Helicopter pilots have been given permission to use cellphones to talk to air traffic control personnel if all other modes of communication fail.         
	In a pre-election meeting, companies operating helicopters have been asked to allow their pilots to use mobile phones, a senior official of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation said in Delhi.        
	Use of mobile phones on board is banned under existing DGCA rules as it has been found that it can affect navigation and communication functions, producing significant errors in instrument displays and background noise in audio outputs.        
	The phone can be used by the pilot only when other modes of communication with the ATC personnel fail, the official stressed. During elections, there is maximum use of helicopters carrying VIPs and so the decision has been taken now, he added.         
	Around 200 helicopters, operated by 55 operators, fly in the Indian skies.         
	Usually helicopters dont fly on designated routes and so there is no radar coverage. Also most of the time, they land at temporarily prepared helipads, said H.N. Mishra, air safety officer, DGCA, eastern India.         
	Often the pilot loses contact with the ATC because of the terrain and low flying altitude. Then the mobile phone can be used by the pilot.        
	The general flying altitude of a helicopter is around 2,000 feet while planes fly at 30,000 feet or above.        
	If a helicopter is beyond 20 nautical miles from an air traffic tower, the very high frequency communication system fails, ATC officials said. It is almost impossible to communicate with the pilot, an official added. After landing, the pilot calls us up and we know that he has made a safe landing.        
	ATC sources said they have been facing problems with helicopters operating in Dhanbad and surrounding areas. There is no airport at Dhanbad but a lot of political leaders are flying there. We cannot know the status of the chopper as the communication gets snapped, a source said, adding that for a pilot, it is also important to know how the weather is before landing.         
	In July 2007, a chopper that took off from Bhopal went missing after it lost contact with the ATC. It was traced in a Chhattisgarh forest. All five persons on board were dead.         
	The pilot had a mobile phone and the ATC knew his number but it was switched off, said an ATC official.

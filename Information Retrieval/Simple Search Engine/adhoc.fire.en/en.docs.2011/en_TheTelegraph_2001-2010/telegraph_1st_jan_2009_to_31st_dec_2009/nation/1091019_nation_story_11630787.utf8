          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 18: Delhi High Court has halved the sentence of a mother who bobbitised her former lover to protect herself from alleged rape, but ruled out further leniency on the ground that she had misused her right to self-defence.        
	Phool Kumari was first given 10 years imprisonment, but the high court reduced the sentence to half, keeping in mind that the convict has minor children.        
	The high court, which upheld a lower court verdict, said the aggressor cannot avail herself of the benefit of private defence if she is armed and in a mood for revenge. Instead, the court said, the benefit of doubt must go to Om Prakash, the former lover, who was unarmed and was a victim of such a heinous act.         
	The right of private defence is essentially a defensive right circumscribed by the governing statute, available only when the circumstances clearly justify it. It should not be allowed to be pleaded as a pretext for a vindictive, aggressive or retributive purpose of offence. It is a right of defence, not of retribution, expected to repel unlawful aggression and not as a retaliatory measure. A right to defend does not include the right to launch an offensive, particularly when the need to defend no longer survives, the court said.         
	Police said that on August 9, 1995, Phool called her younger sister Usha, a minor, to her home in West Vinod Nagar in Delhi. Phools husband Jatan Singh, father Avadh Narain, mother Dhanri Devi and Avadhs brother-in-law Kanchan were present in the house. The police said Om Prakash was called to the house, beaten up and emasculated.         
	Om Prakash told the police Usha sent him a message around midnight to meet her elder sister. He lost consciousness after being thrashed. He said when he woke up two days later, he realised he had been emasculated.         
	An FIR was registered against Phool and all members of her family. Phool alleged in her complaint that Om Prakash, after going to her house, tried to rape her. She and her sister emasculated him to save her honour, Phool said.         
	But a lower court did not buy Phools version. She was held guilty and Om Prakash was acquitted. Usha was later acquitted by a juvenile court.        
	The high court ruled that in the absence of evidence, Jatan Singh, Avadh Narain and Dhanri Devi could not be convicted of emasculating Om Prakash, but noted that the act had been committed with the active involvement of Phool and Usha.        
	Except for Dhanri Devi, all the others were sentenced to 10 years in jail for attempt to murder. Dhanri Devi was given three years in jail.

  39 days to go*
                                      
	 New Delhi: The Election Commission has asked officials to prepare a violation index to track candidates and campaigners as part of efforts to enforce the model code of conduct in the run-up to the polls.          
	Chief electoral officers of all states and Union territories and district election officers have been asked to maintain party-wise daily registers to track transgressions.          case of violations, the registers should indicate the name of the candidate, campaigner and the party, a brief description of the breach, date of violation and the follow-up action, the commission said in a letter.          
	The violation index should also be put in the public domain so that interested parties and media could pick up the input, which might work as a deterrent against future violations, the panel said.          cases involving violation of the code, a unique document evolved with the consensus of political parties, notices would be served on both the candidate and the party concerned, the commission added.                  
	 New Delhi: A prominent Islamic seminary has issued a decree asking Muslims to vote but not on the basis of religion. The vote should not be kept back, the Darul Uloom Deoband said in a fatwa in response to a question whether Muslims should vote in the elections. One should vote for the party and the leader that is better and works in favour of Muslims and the country.          
	The fatwa said India was a democratic and secular country. Hence it is out of place to look at its politics in Islamic perspective....          
	The decree left it to the people to decide whom to vote for and said it was the responsibility of every Muslim to utilise their franchise as much as possible correctly.                  
	 Mumbai: Politicians arent the only ones sleeping less these days  air traffic controllers, too, are bracing for long nights. During elections, air traffic rises by at least 5 per cent as a good number of politicians use choppers and small aircraft to travel for campaigning, a Mumbai ATC employee said. The pressure is maximum on Mumbai and Delhi ATCs as they cover a large part of the countrys air-space, the official added.

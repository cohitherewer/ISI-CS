The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Orissa council disappoints cadre of twin cities
                                                                                                               Orissa council disappoints cadre of twin cities
          SUBRAT DAS                              
	Bhubaneswar, May 21: People of Bhubaneswar and Cuttack were left disappointed by the new ministry today.        
	It was in the two cities that BJD swept the Assembly polls and civic polls earlier. Now, the two cities have been left un-represented.        
	The twin cities have sent six BJD legislators (three from Bhubaneswar and Cuttack each) to the Assembly and had earlier elected more than 60 per cent of the corporators in the December-January civic polls.        
	BJD workers and supporters in Cuttack expected that at least veteran Dalit leader and former minister Kalindi Behera and two-time party MLA Debasis Samantray, elected from Cuttack (Sadar) and Cuttack-Barabati Assembly seat, respectively, would find a place in the new cabinet. Beheras son, Chandra Sarathi, elected from neighbouring Salipur constituency, is missing as well.        
	Similarly, it was anticipated that former Union information officer Ashok Chandra Panda, who won from Bhubaneswar-Ekamra seat by a margin of more than 50,000 votes would be made a minister. Former minister Arabinda Dhali, who was elected from Jayadev (SC) constituency, also expected a ministerial berth.        
	However, none of them were taken in the new ministry, rued the party workers from the twin cities.         
	Who will look into the requirements of our city, asked a visibly irritated Raju Jena from Paika Nagar area in Bhubaneswar.        
	In the past, legislators of the twin cities were given ministerial berths with plum portfolios. Biswa Bhusan Harichandan, elected from undivided Bhubaneswar Assembly seat before, had been made a senior cabinet minister with important portfolios such as revenue, industries or rural development in BJD-BJP coalition government in 2000 and 2004. Similarly, Samir Dey, who represented undivided Cuttack, had served as the urban development and the higher education minister in the previous two governments.        
	Khurda, which has elected BJD candidates in six out of eight Assembly seats, did not have any representation, either.        
	Neighbouring Puri district, where BJD won five out of the six Assembly seats, suffered the same fate.        
	Other districts ignored during the ministry formation include Nayagarh (BJD has won all four Assembly seats there), Koraput (BJD won three out of five seats), Sonepur, Boudh and Rayagada (BJD won two seats in all the Assembly constituencies).        
	However, BJD leader Pyari Mohan Mohapatra, who played a key role in the selection of ministers, said the new ministry was well represented by various regions and sections. Its a balanced ministry, he said.

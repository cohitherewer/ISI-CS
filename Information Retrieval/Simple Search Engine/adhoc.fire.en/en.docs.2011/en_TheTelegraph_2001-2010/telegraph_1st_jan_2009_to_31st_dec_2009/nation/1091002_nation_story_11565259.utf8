The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Viveik healer leads Sangh cow drive   Monk push for worthy sons
                                                                                                               Viveik healer leads Sangh cow drive     Monk push for worthy sons
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Suresh Oberoi touches Ashok Singhals feet at the Vishwa Mangala Gau Gram Yatra at Kurukshetra on Wednesday. Ramakant Kushwaha                                        
	Kurukshetra, Oct. 1: Looking to breathe life into a tired old theme, the Sangh parivar has turned to a young swami who had pepped up a Viveik Oberoi mooning over the loss of Aishwarya Rai.  
	Swami Raghaveshwara Bharati, pontiff of Ramachandra Mutt in Karnatakas Shimoga, yesterday flagged off the four-month, nation-wide Vishwa Mangala Gau Gram Yatra for cow protection, sponsored by the RSS, Vishwa Hindu Parishad and sundry mahants.        
	Although the VHPs Ashok Singhal couldnt help making strident anti-minority remarks as he demanded a ban on cow slaughter, the RSS pitched the yatra in softer tones, arguing that saving the cow meant a return to a rural idyll. Enough to have even Gandhians from Vinoba Bhaves ashram join in.        
	No central BJP leader was present, but it may not be a coincidence that the yatra comes right before the Assembly elections in three states including Haryana.        
	The man who really enthused the crowd at the Brahma Sarovar, in a town where every vacant space is supposed to have been a Pandava-Kaurava battlefield, was Suresh Oberoi. The former actor kept following the swami throughout.        
	Three years ago, Suresh had sent broken-hearted son Viveik to the 40-something swamis hermitage in Hosanagar among the arecanut plantations. The monks disciples claimed he had cured Viveik of his heartache.        
	The swami has powerful votaries in Karnataka chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa and his predecessor H.D. Kumaraswamy, to both of whom he had gifted a rare cow of a dying indigenous stock.        
	The swami has been a doer, his mission being to revive the local strains of cows, cleansing the cattle population of the hybrid Jerseys and restoring the forgotten spiritual bond between the gau mata (mother cow) and her errant sons.        
	So he seemed a good bet to flag off the yatra, a ride on a motorised bus painted with a cow and scenes of rural peace that is to climax in a rally at the Sanghs Nagpur headquarters four months on.        
	He did not grate on the ears like Singhal, who took swipes at kasais (butchers) and demanded the secular state be banished. Nor was he as staid as the Sanghs second-in-command, Suresh Bhaiyya Joshi, who merely said: The village is Indias soul and the cow is the soul of the village and should be cherished.        
	In a mellifluous voice, the swami craved Mother Cows forgiveness for humankinds sins and promised that just as Krishna had made a man out of Arjuna in Kurukshetra, every male present would morph into her worthy sons.        
	Indresh, the pranth pracharak (state propagandist), said this would be the Sanghs line during the yatra to try and strengthen its networks in rural India.        
	Nobody  neither the mahants nor the Sangh-VHP representatives or the handful of local BJP leaders present was willing to wager on the programmes success, considering that all of them had used cow protection in their discourses periodically with little impact.        
	The sceptics were reminded that when the VHP had kicked off the Ram temple campaign in 1984 with a Ram Shila Yatra, nobody had taken it seriously.        
	But that was because the BJP had politicised it, a Sangh source said. Today nobody was sure if a down-and-out L.K. Advani would ride yet another chariot for the sake of a holy cow.

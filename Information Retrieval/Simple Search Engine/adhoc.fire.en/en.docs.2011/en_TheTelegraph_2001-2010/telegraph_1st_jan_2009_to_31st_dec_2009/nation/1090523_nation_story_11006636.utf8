The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mamata poll call draws Nitish ire 
                                                                                                               Mamata poll call draws Nitish ire 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	Patna, May 22: Nitish Kumar today slammed Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjees call for early elections in Bengal. It (demand for early polls) is against the spirit of the Constitution, the Bihar chief minister said.        
	Nitish clarified: I am opposed to any move for dismissing an elected government. The demand for central intervention in the Left-ruled Bengal is draconian, against the spirit of our Constitution and an affront to the peoples verdict.        
	Mamatas party has done well in Bengal. But it does not mean that Bengals people have given her a mandate to demand the dismissal of a democratically elected government, the chief minister said.        
	He said he had also strongly opposed BSP chief Mayavatis similar demand to dismiss the Uttar Pradesh government headed by Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav then.        
	Nitish said he had all respect for the peoples mandate which has resulted in the Congress-led UPA getting close to the magic figure in the Lok Sabha. But the results clearly reflect a strong mandate to the NDA in Bihar which the Congress-led government must respect, he said.        
	The voters have removed the obstacles in the relationship between the state government and the Centre, he said, adding: There is better political atmosphere now for the Centre to help the state government step up development work here.        
	Though he did not name anyone, It was clear Nitish saw Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan as obstacles as the two former Union ministers, according to his belief, did not allow the previous UPA government to help Bihar in a big way fearing that the chief minister would run away with the credit.        
	Besides, the RJDs central ministers, led by Lalu Prasad, used to attack the Nitish government in course of their visit to the state even if some central ministers of the Congress and other states praised the Bihar government for the improvement in the law and order situation.        
	Nitish, who has earned brownie points with several Congress leaders including Rahul Gandhi and Sheila Dixit, is expecting a better working relationship between the Centre and the state now.

                                                                                                               CBI quiz amp; case loom on Buta
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Aug. 1: A corruption case may be slapped on Buta Singh if the cabinet permits the CBI to quiz him, agency sources hinted, though its chief said no decision has been taken yet.        
	The CBI needs the nod because Buta, whose son Sarobjit has been accused of taking a bribe, is the chairperson of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes, which is a constitutional office.        
	Sarobjit was arrested yesterday for taking Rs 1 crore from a contractor to get a case against him withdrawn by the commission.        
	CBI director Ashwani Kumar told PTI that Buta would be questioned if required. If necessary, we will.... No decision has been taken on it yet. We will go by the law, he said.        
	But the sources in the agency said the former Union home minister would be booked under the Prevention of Corruption Act.        
	Buta today refused to step down as the commissions chairperson  a demand made by the BJP. Resign? Why should I resign? he snapped.        
	When told about police claims that his son had confessed to demanding the bribe and that his father knew about the alleged deal, Buta said: He must have naturally made it (confession) under pressure.        
	Today, Delhi police filed a case against Sarobjit under the arms act after seizing pistols, allegedly unlicensed, and 40 bullets while raiding his home.

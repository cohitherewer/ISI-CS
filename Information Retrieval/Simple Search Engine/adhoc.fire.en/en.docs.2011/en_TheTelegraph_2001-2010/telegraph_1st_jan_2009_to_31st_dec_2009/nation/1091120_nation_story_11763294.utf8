	Dhaka, Nov. 19: Bangladesh authorities today vowed to hunt down and hang the six fugitive killers of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman too after the Supreme Court rejected appeals from five other convicts to commute their penalties.        
	The court upheld the death penalty on all 12 convicts, of whom one has died abroad and six are believed to be hiding in the US, Libya, Canada and possibly Pakistan.        
	Sacked army officers Syed Farook Rahman, A.K.M. Mohiuddin Ahmed, Shahriar Rashid Khan, Muhiuddin Ahmed and Bazlul Huda were in their condemned cells at Dhaka Central Jail when the court rejected their appeals. Their lawyers said they would consider filing mercy petitions before President Mohammad Zillur Rahman.        
	The six fugitives are sacked army officers Khandaker Abdur Rashid, Shariful Haq Dalim, A.B. Noor Chowdhury, A.M. Rashed Chowdhury, Abdul Majed and Risaldar Noslemuddin.        
	Dhaka has launched a diplomatic campaign to bring them back and is seeking the help of Interpol. The six do not have the option of appealing to the President for mercy.        
	They will be executed whenever they are caught and brought back to the country, attorney-general Mahbube Alam said.        
	We are trying to bring the killers back home, foreign secretary Mijarul Qayes confirmed. Since the issue is very sensitive, we dont want to discuss the details.        
	Dhakas problem is that it has no extradition treaty with the countries the fugitives are believed to be hiding in.        
	Cheers erupted in the courtroom today after the verdict, with ruling Awami League supporters shouting: Justice delayed but not denied.        
	Heavy security was clamped in and around the court and throughout Dhaka as authorities feared a backlash by the killers supporters, but no violence was reported.        
	Last month, a bomb was hurled at the car of a lawyer advising the government on the convicts appeals, injuring 15 Awami League members. Police have detained several relatives of the convicts as suspects in the attack.        
	Mujib, called Bangabandu (friend of Bangladesh), led his countrys fight against Pakistan that ended in independence for the former East Pakistan in December 1971. He became the countrys first President after Independence and later its Prime Minister.

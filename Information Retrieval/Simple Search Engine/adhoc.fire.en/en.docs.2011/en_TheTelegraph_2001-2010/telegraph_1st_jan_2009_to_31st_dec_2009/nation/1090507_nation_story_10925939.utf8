	Raipur, May 6: Obliging hitch-hiking personnel cost four villagers their lives as Maoist landmine blew up a tractor in Dantewada (Chhattisgarh) today, killing 11 people.        
	The victims included two CRPF personnel and five Special Police Officers (SPOs), besides the villagers. The personnel were local villagers recruited and armed by the government to combat the red army in Bastar.         
	The incident took place near Sirguda village on Bhejji-Injaram road about 12.30pm today when the rebels blew up a tractor carrying both the villagers and the personnel, said Bastar inspector-general A.N. Upadhyay.         
	The tractor was returning after transporting grain and essential commodities to the Bhejji relief camp, one of the 22 shelter homes set up by the government to house villagers who have abandoned their villages following Maoist attacks.         
	The exact number of villagers travelling in the tractor is not known.        
	The two CRPF personnel and eight SPOs intercepted the tractor 5km from Injaram. As the vehicle reached the spot where the landmine was hidden, rebels detonated the bomb. Most passengers died on the spot, while three SPOs and a few villagers were injured in the attack.         
	In rebel-hit states security personnel have been warned against boarding vehicles and have been asked to walk through areas that may have hidden landmines in them.         
	On the other hand, rebels have been warning villagers to not give lifts to security personnel. But, often fear of policemen leads them to ignore the rebel threat. A senior police officer in the state police headquarters said that the rebels took away five rifles and 200 rounds of ammunition from the security personnel.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Imams   in strike threat   over pay
                                                                                                               Imams   in strike threat   over pay
          CITHARA PAUL                                          
	New Delhi, July 30: Factory workers have done it, so have doctors and pilots. Now imams of mosques have threatened a strike over pay.        
	The All India Imam Organisation (AIIO), which represents most of the countrys imams, says tens of thousands of these clerics will boycott work nation-wide if the state wakf boards refuse to hike their salaries to Rs 7,000.        
	Imams lead the namaaz five times a day, including the Friday prayers, and many take on the mantle of leader of the local community. A strike would be a severe embarrassment. We are unable to make ends meet. An imams is a full-time job, requiring a lot of time and energy, said AIIO president Moulana Jameel Ahmed Ilyasi.        
	He didnt mention a date or duration for the strike but said the organisation could also approach the Supreme Court.        
	All mosques in the country are wakf properties and are managed by the state wakf boards, which decide imams salaries. In Delhi, imams are now eligible for a monthly salary of Rs 5,000 but Ilyasi claims that most of them receive less.        
	His organisation says imams who have done a course at a religious institution should be paid Rs 7,000 and those who havent should at least be paid the full Rs 5,000.        
	We are being paid meagrely not because the wakf boards are poor but because of their disregard for the post of imam, he said.        
	The wakf boards are unhappy with the imams threat. The chairman of the Delhi wakf board, Chaudhry Mateen Ahmad, said most imams saw their job as a part-time one.

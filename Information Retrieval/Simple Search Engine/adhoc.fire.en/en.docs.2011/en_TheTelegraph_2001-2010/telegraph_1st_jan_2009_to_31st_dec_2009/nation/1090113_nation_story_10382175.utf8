The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation |In Dharavi, underdogs dont care 
                                                                                                               In Dharavi, underdogs dont care 
          [+uc('Slum slam   SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI')+]                                                  
	Mumbai, Jan. 12: Asif Gajab comes straight to the point: what does Dharavi care if they win the Golden Globe or gold or even diamonds?        
	A soap-unit owner in Asias largest slum, Asif has no illusions  he knows that more teams like the one that filmed Slumdog Millionaire will keep coming to milk Dharavi, but no number of Golden Globes will change the lives of the people there.        
	Who cares who wins what? So many people come here to make films, they are all trying to make a living, trying to capture on film how we make a living. But we have to go on making a living despite these films  what do we care if they win gold or diamonds? he asks.        
	Most of the people, even Rasheed Bhai who came to Mumbai from Gorakhpur to join films but now runs an illegal theatre in Dharavis back alleys, dont have much of an idea what the excitement is all about or what the film is, for that matter.        
	What is this movie? Has it released? Any idea if I can get a pirated version? he asks.        
	Rasheed ekes out a living by showing pirated versions of the latest releases in a decrepit shanty-theatre that goes by the name of Allahrakha Cinema Hall.        
	The walls of the theatre are covered in a depressing black  and a cloth banner proudly flutters in the wind announcing its name  but there is a state-of-the-art home theatre system, full with a huge LCD plasma TV.        
	I would like to show this Slumdog movie here. When is it releasing? Is it a foreign movie? Then there will be pirated versions on the Net. There are very smart boys here who can help me download it, Rasheed says.        
	His rates are: Rs 5 for a Bollywood flick and Rs 10 for a Hollywood film.        
	There are many educated boys here  many know a lot about cinema. They may like to see this Slumdog. I charge these people Rs 20 per head, he adds, grinning.        
	A moment later, Rasheed suddenly asks: Everybody in Mumbai knows what a millionaire is, but what does a slumdog mean?        
	His face darkens when he learns the answer.        
	An expletive later, he shrugs: Well, who cares, as long as I can charge Rs 20 a head for it.        
	But there are others who are not amused. We should put a charge on shooting in Dharavi. If it is a global destination for filmmakers, let them pay residents association fees also (along with the corporation). Everybody wants to exploit the squalor here, Raju Korade, the general secretary of Dharavi Bachao Andolan, bristles.        
	But the films Indian co-director Loveleen Tandan disagrees. There was no ulterior motive We wanted to bring in a realistic portraiture. But in no way is it meant to offend. It just shows the grit of the underdog despite the surroundings, she says.        
	Fingers crossed        
	A little before the awards were announced, Slumdog director Danny Boyle texted the father of Mumbai teen actor Ashutosh Lobo who plays Salim, the brother of protagonist Jamal Malik in the film.        
	Hope, not expect, he messaged Kalpesh Gajiwala, a cosmetic surgeon, keeping my fingers firmly crossed.

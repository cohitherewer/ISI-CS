The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | NGO seeks teen victims address
                                                                                                               NGO seeks teen victims address
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, May 28: Ruchika Child Helpline, a city NGO, is seeking the address of a teenager under their care for the past 11 months. Today, the NGO wrote to the director of social welfare, Usha Padhi, to contact her Nepal and Bihar counterparts for help.        
	Lakshman (name changed) does not remember how he boarded the train or with who.         
	But the 13-year-old remembers a middle-aged tying his hands, abusing him and hitting his head against the strong iron bars of a trains window.         
	Finally, the same man sliced off a protion of Lakshmans tongue. The boy, barely in his teens, was found in his bloody state by two engineering students who were travelling on the same train.        
	The men carried the young boy to the Red Cross office in Bhubaneswar from where he was referred to Ruchika Child Helpline. That was on July 14, 2008, said Bimal Kumar Samantray, the centre co-ordinator. Its 11 months since and Lakshmans condition has only deteriorated.         
	Recently, the teen stopped taking his meals and as a result has grown weak.         
	We wish to get in touch with his relatives and rehabilitate him. Our officials today wrote to the director of Social Welfare, Usha Padhi, to contact her counterparts in Nepal or Bihar so that they could take necessary measures to help identify the boys relatives.        
	When he was brought in he was suffering from severe injuries and the lower part of his tongue was cut. We have understood that he speaks both Hindi and Nepalese. We are guessing that he comes from a border area, said Samantray.         
	He hails from either Imphal or Nepal. But, but we are not sure, Bimal said, adding that the boy has been changing his statement ever since.         
	All these months, the boy has undergone endless counselling sessions which, counsellors rue, have been of little help. Doctors believe that Lakshman needs to be admitted to a clinic for professional help.        
	However, in absence of such clinics in Orissa, those at Ruchika have little choices.         
	We are not sure if he was mentally sound when he boarded the train or if he lost his mind after being attacked, he said, adding: His counselling was difficult and we had to resort to several sessions that led to a hypothetical report.         
	We are aware that Lakshman should be kept separately, but we are forced to keep the boy with other children, said the co-ordinator.

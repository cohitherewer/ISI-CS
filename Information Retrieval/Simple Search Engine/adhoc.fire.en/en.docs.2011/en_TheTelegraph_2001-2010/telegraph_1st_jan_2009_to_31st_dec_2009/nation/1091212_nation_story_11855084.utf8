The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Peace on Rosaiah lips, ball in Centre court   CM says Delhi will advise
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Peace on Rosaiah lips, ball in Centre court     CM says Delhi will advise
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                                                 
	Hyderabad, Dec. 11: Stunned by the severity of the statehood backlash, Andhra Pradesh chief minister K. Rosaiah today sought to placate political mutineers by saying he was under no obligation to move an Assembly resolution on Telangana and any such move would only be by consensus.         
	I have not been asked either orally or in writing to move the resolution on Telangana in the Assembly, Rosaiah said in the morning as part of his appeal to the 136 MLAs who have submitted their resignations in protest against the Centres announcement on Wednesday night.         
	All they (the Congress high command) told me is that they will advise me (about the resolution) at an appropriate time, he added.        
	As the protests refused to subside and the resignation letters continued to pour in, Rosaiah went a step further later in the day.         
	In a statement issued late tonight, the chief minister said it would be difficult to get the resolution passed even if it was moved in the current session. Any process relating to the formation of a Telangana state will be done only through consensus, he said in the statement.        
	The protests spread with anti-Telangana activists, who had called a bandh in Rayalaseema and coastal Andhra, blocking roads and highways and damaging public property. Two persons committed suicide in coastal Andhra, saying they hoped their sacrifice would lead to a samaikya Andhra (integrated Andhra).         
	As of Friday evening, as many as 136 legislators had sent their resignations to Speaker Kiran Kumar Reddy. Among them are 79 of the Congress, 43 from the Telugu Desam and 14 from actor Chiranjeevis Praja Rajyam. All the MLAs are from Rayalaseema and coastal Andhra, which together account for 175 Assembly seats.        
	Among the MLAs who resigned was D. Venkateswara Rao, husband of Union minister Purandeswari.        
	The Speaker adjourned the Assembly till Monday after some members entered the House to stage a dharna in the well, seeking a samaikya Andhra. Reddy said he would take legal opinion on the future of the resignation letters.        
	Elected members of local bodies also began submitting their resignations.        
	The chief minister, who was just settling down in his job after weathering an aggressive challenge from Y.S. Jaganmohan, the ambitious son of the late Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, appeared shaken as he asked floor leaders of Opposition parties and also the Congress to counsel the disgruntled members.         
	If the resignations are accepted, this government will be in a minority, he said. The Congress has 155 MLAs in the House of 294.         
	Asked why they were resigning, Erasu Pratap Reddy, a Congress MLA from Kurnool, said: There is no point in remaining legislators when we cannot protect the rights of our voters. With Telangana as a separate state, our Rayalaseema will never get its share of water, power, jobs and funds, he said.        
	Former Telugu Desam minister Ashok Gajapathi Raju of Vizianagaram said they were resigning in protest against the unilateral decision of the Congress.        
	The political rebellion spread to the high court. Advocates from Telengana came to blows with those from the two other regions. The court had to be closed down for the day.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PC pulls out all stops   Cell to cut-out, headmaster woos hard
                                                                                                               PC pulls out all stops 
  Cell to cut-out, headmaster woos hard          G.C. SHEKHAR IN SIVAGANGA (TN)                        Bullock carts mounted with cut-outs of the hand symbol snake through Sivaganga; (below) Chidambaram campaigns in the constituency.

	Cellphones to bullock carts, they are all part of P. Chidambarams campaign kit.        
	The home minister may have won Sivaganga six out of seven times, notching the most Lok Sabha victories among the current Tamil Nadu candidates, but he is taking no chances.        
	PC knows he faces his toughest battle this time in the rural seat  perhaps barring 1999 when he belonged to a non-viable third front and finished third  and so is running a pervasive campaign.        
	Recorded messages, in his own voice, plug his achievements on the cellphones of his constituents. The bullock carts, with a huge hand symbol mounted on them, slow-foot it through the arid outback.        
	Most of the persuasion, though, comes from the man himself, in simple and fluent Tamil delivered with his usual panache. After his convoy stops at villages, even those with 200 voters, PC, dressed in his trademark white dhoti and shirt, gets off his white SUV and climbs into an open jeep parked under a tree. He then reels off what he has done for his constituency.        
	At 63, he covers more than a dozen villages every day. He leaves his ancestral home at Kandanur, near Karaiakudi town, by 7am and returns for lunch and a quick nap before continuing from 4pm till 10 in the night.        
	At the venue, an aide hands over a paper typed with tasks accomplished in the village and the panchayat it comes under. A local functionary whispers to him that he should promise funds to repair the school building.        
	Speech over, PC leaves with a cursory namaste, the distant stare and the pedestal air around him undisturbed. Once inside the cool cabin of the car, he sips water, or perhaps coconut water, and occasionally has a bowl of fruits.        
	Most of the territory, of course, has already been covered by his son Karti, who manages the constituency in his absence. To tell you the truth, our campaign goes on for the full five years. There is no village I have not visited, Karti explains.        
	Yet the voters do not seem to be warming up to their longstanding MP as much as one would expect them to.        
	Even when he visits the constituency, Chidambaram drives with the tinted glasses of his car firmly rolled up. At functions he behaves more like a stern headmaster rather than a caring giver. You cannot even hand over a petition to him directly, says Murugesan, a teacher in Sivaganga town.        
	In his 20-minute speech, Chidambaram meshes together the welfare schemes of the UPA and the states DMK government.         
	Can you ever dream of a better package than this to improve your lives? It is only because you had a caring government in Delhi and an understanding government in Chennai, who were willing to work hand in hand, that we could give you guaranteed work, write off your farm loans, and provide you with cheap rice and free colour TVs and gas stoves, and loans at 12 per cent instead of 60 per cent, he says.        
	On a personal note, he boasts that 16,000 students from Sivaganga district alone have received educational loans amounting to Rs 72 crore without any demand for security. Just the parents signature on the application form will do, he explains.        
	He then lists what he has done for the village  such as deepening the irrigation tank or building an outdoor platform for festivals.        
	But the sparse crowds remain largely indifferent. Perhaps its their over-familiarity with the candidate or what he is going to say (already in booklets distributed across the constituency). Sometimes its because the welfare measures have passed them by.        
	Indira, who owns a small shop in Periakottai village, says: We have not benefited from the farm loans or their waiver because banks would lend only to those who have two acres and above, and not to people like me who have one acre or less. The free colour TV has not come this way. The price rise means people buy less from me and I dont make enough to keep my family going.        
	How can she blame Chidambaram? The retort comes fast: Wasnt he the finance minister?        
	PC talks about inaugurating the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and the farm loan waiver scheme at Sivaganga, and about bringing 46 new bank branches to serve the local population. Try getting an educational loan, these banks ask either for collateral or a recommendation letter, complains Chandrasekaran, a cycle shop owner in Sivaganga town.        
	Fortunately for PC, the Lankan Tamil issue has made little impact among the rural voters. Even in the towns, it is a non-issue with the public angered more by the frequent power cuts.        
	Amid the simmering discontent, Chidambaram is up against a strong ADMK candidate. Raja Kannappan, a former state minister, has deep pockets and, apparently, the support of some industrial houses opposed to PC.        
	Kannappans campaign is more informal than his rivals  he walks into the villages, prays at the temples and even sips the buttermilk handed by a supporter.         
	Even when he was PWD minister we could walk up to him with a problem and he would solve it, a villager in Ilayankudi said.        
	Delimitation has ensured that two lakh votes  nearly a fifth of the total  belong to Kannappans Yadava community. Voters want a new face from Sivaganga and not a tired candidate like Chidambaram, a confident Kannappan says in his speeches.        
	PCs supporters are banking on one factor: Chidambaram remains an automatic choice for a senior ministers post in a Congress-led government.         
	To this, Kannappan retorts that he too shall be Union minister if an ADMK-friendly alliance comes to power, so Sivaganga will not lose out by rejecting Chidambaram.

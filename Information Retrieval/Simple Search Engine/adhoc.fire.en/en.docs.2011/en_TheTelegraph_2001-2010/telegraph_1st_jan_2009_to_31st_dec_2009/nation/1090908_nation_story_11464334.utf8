	New Delhi, Sept. 7: The Lyngdoh committee guidelines prescribing age and eligibility criteria for college union elections are too stringent, petitions filed in the Supreme Court on behalf of some students have said.        
	One demand is for the relaxation of the rule that bars anyone from contesting for the post of an office-bearer more than once. One petitioner, who lost a Delhi University election last year, said the rule should apply only to winners.        
	The law officer assisting the court, Gopal Subramanium, said the issue needed clarification. But he was less enthusiastic about a suggestion to increase the age bar for research students who wished to contest such polls from 28 to 32.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Drought spreads in bread belt
                                                                                                               Drought spreads in bread belt
          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                              
	Lucknow, July 27: Nearly 70 per cent of Uttar Pradesh, the bread basket that accounts for 21 per cent of the countrys grain output, has been declared drought-hit.        
	Officially, 47 of the states 70 districts have got the tag, 27 of them last evening. The declaration has rung alarm bells among farmers and prompted the Mayavati government to mount crisis-management measures, besides asking for central assistance.        
	A drop in farm output in the state spells trouble for the countrys overall harvest, for consumers already reeling under high food prices and for the rural economy on whose strength the Centre is hoping to fight the downturn.        
	Chaudhary Laxmi Narayan, the state agriculture minister, said sowing was only 30 per cent of the level during this period last year. We are going to set aside Rs 300 crore (for drought relief) and have sought an assistance of Rs 600 crore from the Centre to help our farmers, he said.         
	We will supply fresh seeds (of the kind that requires less water) as part of the relief package, he added.         
	Government estimates say rains were 58 per cent below normal between June 1 and July 22.         
	Immediately affected is the rice crop. Production is likely to fall as sowing is down, said chief secretary Atul Chandra Gupta. The state is Indias third largest rice producer.

  - Naxalite attacks claim two lives in Orissa amp; Bihar, cash looted        OUR CORRESPONDENT                          twin strikes                                        
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 23: Armed Naxalites shot a contractor and blew up three towers, being installed by Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), at Gobindpalli village in Malkangiri, some 600km from here.        
	A rebel army of 60 armed men unleashed terror around midnight and carried on with their destructive spree for about an hour.         
	The deceased, P.K. Swain, a special-class contractor in the area, was dragged out of his home before being gunned down. His house was also set on fire. The rebel operation began around 10.30pm and continued till midnight, police sources said.        
	The Naxalites managed to create panic in the area by ransacking houses and torching 10 vehicles  mostly trucks  engaged in an ongoing government power project in the area.         
	They also looted cash from some of the homes, said an officer at the Mathili police station.         
	Eyewitnesses accounts state that at the beginning of the operation, three men arrived and threatened residents to switch off their mobile phones and snap landline connection. The rebels then set the local police outpost on fire.         
	Before leaving, the Naxalites pasted posters opposing rampant industrialisation and the installation of COBRA battalion in the area.         
	They also blocked the Malkangiri-Govindpalli-Jeypore road by felling trees, thereby successfully blocking the entry of police reinforcements to the area for a long time.         
	The residents today expressed their discontent over the police inefficiency and failure of the intelligence bureau in reporting the matter.         
	Intensified combing operations are continuing in the area. The operation will continue today, said deputy inspector-general of police (south western range) Sanjib Panda.        
	In a related incident, suspected Naxalites looted valuables from the house of MP Jual Oram and assaulted two of his family at Kendudihi village in Sundergarh.        
	A group of armed men barged into Orams house around 8pm last night. The 12 heavily-armed men or robbers were all masked, said Rourkela superintendent of police Santosh Bala.         
	The men assaulted Orams mother and sister-in-law and looted gold ornaments and cash from them.        
	The villagers rushed in only after hearing screams from the house. However, their efforts to nab the men proved vain, as they escaped into a nearby jungle after firing in the air.         
	Oram, who was away at Bhubaneswar, said he was not sure if the attackers were Maoists or robbers.         
	Its almost sure that the men were not Maoists. The robbers may have been local criminals who knew that there was a wedding on in the village and used the opportunity to attempt a loot. However, investigation is on and we will soon nab the culprits, said Bala.

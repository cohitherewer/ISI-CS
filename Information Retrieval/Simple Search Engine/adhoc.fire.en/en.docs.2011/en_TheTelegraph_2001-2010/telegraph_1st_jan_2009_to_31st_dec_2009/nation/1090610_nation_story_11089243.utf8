          OUR BUREAU                          An AN-32 plane                                  
	June 9: An Indian Air Force transport plane with six crew members and six army personnel went missing after taking off from an Arunachal Pradesh base this afternoon, sparking fears that it had crashed.        
	The AN-32, which left Mechuka at around 2pm, lost radio contact an hour later, and hadnt been found till late in the night, the defence public relations officer in Shillong, Wing Commander Ranjib Sahoo, said.        
	The aircraft took off from Mechuka at 2pm and went missing thereafter. Till now, no wreckage has been found, he added. Sahoo said the names of those on board couldnt be divulged till the wreckage was found.        
	Teams of the IAF and the army were out looking for the plane but no aerial search could be conducted, officials said in Delhi. There is no night flying in the region.         
	The officials said the plane had made the last radio contact with Mohanbari airbase, near Dibrugarh in Assam, seeking to land there because of bad weather.         
	In the normal course, it should have been back by 3pm in Jorhat, from where it had taken off for the Arunachal base earlier in the day.        
	The officials said the aircraft was on a routine maintenance sortie  carrying supplies for soldiers on Arunachals border with China.        
	The AN-32  the IAFs workhorse and generally regarded safe  was declared missing two-and-a-half hours after its endurance time, around 4.30pm.         
	Endurance time is the stretch of time a plane can fly non-stop.        
	The six IAF crew included two pilots and four airmen, who help load and unload supplies and offer engineering support.         
	The officials said it was possible the army personnel were going home on leave from Mechuka.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          The Assembly session in progress in Bhubaneswar on Monday. Picture by Sanjib Mukherjee                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 7: In an unprecedented move, the Opposition today held a symbolic session of the Orissa Assembly without the government and the Speaker to protest against the abrupt adjournment of the House with more than 11 days of the session left.         
	It was a unique session as neither was there an Assembly reporter present to record the proceedings nor was there any minister to reply to questions or defend the government. Even journalists were not allowed to report or telecast proceedings.        
	While chief minister Naveen Patnaik dismissed the protest as highly irregular and a publicity stunt, the Opposition asserted that todays sitting conformed with the Constitution and the Rules of Procedures and Conduct of Business of Orissa Legislative Assembly.         
	According to Article 189 (iii) of the Constitution, 10 per cent of the total strength of the Assembly (147) forms a quorum to run the House.         
	That would be 14 members and today, at least 32 members  25 from Congress, five from BJP and two Independents  were present, claimed Opposition chief whip Prasad Harichandan.        
	Quoting Article 180 (ii), Harichandan said the Assembly sitting was duly presided over by an MLA, Debi Prasanna Chand of the Congress, who conducted the House sitting on a chair near the Speakers podium.        
	The Opposition Congress, BJP and Independent members have been camping in House  and sleeping on its floor braving the chilly weather  since Saturday evening in protest against the abrupt adjournment of the session, fearing it would be locked up by the Assembly staff once they left.        
	Todays sitting started as any other with question hour. The questions, asked by the Opposition, were discussed. Though there were no replies in the absence of the chief minister and other ministers, the presiding officer issued necessary direction to the government, Harichandan said.        
	The winter session of the Assembly that began on November 18 and was scheduled to conclude on December 19, had been adjourned sine die on Saturday evening, sparking the Opposition protest.         
	Agitated MLAs marched to the Raj Bhavan yesterday and urged the Governor to intervene.        
	The session was adjourned abruptly because the government was afraid of facing the Opposition over the multi-crore mining scam, alleged leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh, pointing out that as per rules, the Assembly should have no less than three sessions with minimum of 60 sitting days.        
	During zero hour today, there was a commotion when the Assembly caretaker and photographer entered the House to take pictures with the help of cellphones, leading to Opposition protests.        
	The proceedings were adjourned for around 30 minutes due to the pandemonium. How could they be allowed inside when reporters and photographers were denied entry? We have seized the cellphones and informed the Assembly secretary, said Harichandan.        
	Later, Singh and BJP legislature party leader K.V. Singhdeo raised the issue of farmers suicides before moving an adjournment motion condemning the abrupt adjournment of the Assembly in an undemocratic and unconstitutional manner.

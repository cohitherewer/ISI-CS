The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Poll machines in Braille
                                                                                                               Poll machines in Braille
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                          A Braille voting machine being tried out                                  
	Hyderabad, March 20: Over a dozen hands at a Hyderabad institute are toiling on devices that will enable four million visually challenged to vote without fear of manipulation.        
	The employees of Devnar Foundation are racing to meet the March 31 deadline to produce Braille stickers to be used in modified electronic voting machines (EVMs) for the blind.        
	Such machines were first used in an Andhra byelection in 2004 and in seven other states, Bengal among them, in later years. But this will be the first time when they will be available on such a large scale.        
	Devnar played a key role in the experiment by designing self-adhesive stickers in Braille to be pasted on the voting machines. The month-end target for the institute is to churn out 4.5 lakh stickers for 10 states. The National Association for the Blind is making the stickers for other states at its Delhi and Mumbai branches.        
	The Braille stickers, pasted on the right side of the machines, bear the names of parties and candidates, the symbols and the numbers assigned to them, serially.        
	It takes less than two minutes for a visually challenged person to recognise the candidates from the special Braille stickers and cast the vote, said a Devnar teacher who co-ordinated the use of the Braille machines in the Delhi Assembly polls held last November.        
	The push to design the machines came from the Supreme Court in 2002, when some visually challenged persons in Delhi sought a solution to their voting problems.        
	Till then, people with such disabilities had to take the help of someone while voting, with the nagging fear that the person may not eventually register their choice.

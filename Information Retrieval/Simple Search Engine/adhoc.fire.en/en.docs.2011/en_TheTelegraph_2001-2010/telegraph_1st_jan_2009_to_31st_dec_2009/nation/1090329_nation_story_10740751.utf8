The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Burglary in beggar homes
                                                                                                               Burglary in beggar homes
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                              
	New Delhi, March 28: Delhi government officials running beggar homes are stealing from the beggars bowl.        
	That is the inference drawn by an NGO that filed an application under the information act with the state governments social welfare department on the money allegedly embezzled from the homes  which are essentially houses where the beggars serve their punishment.        
	The NGO, Pratidhi, claims that the 10 such homes, most on the outskirts, have no account of the money confiscated from the beggars over the past 38 years. It suspects that the officials have been siphoning off the cash.        
	Begging in the capital is illegal under the Bombay Prevention of Begging Act, 1960, which the state has adopted. A recent survey said the beggars earn Rs 50 to Rs 500 daily.        
	The homes have been running since 1970, and the NGO says the officials could have usurped the unaccounted earnings of thousands of beggars.         
	The revelations come at a time the Delhi government has launched a drive to rid the streets of beggars to spruce up the city before the 2010 Commonwealth Games.        
	I had Rs 3,245 with me when I had come to the home. When I finished my term and was released, I was given only Rs 100. These people (the officials) are like petty thieves, stealing from beggars. Maybe, they should beg like us, says 55-year-old Krishna, who begs near the Janpath market in central Delhi and had served time in one of the homes in Lampur, north-west Delhi.        
	Krishna alleged even relatives of the dead beggars were shooed away if they asked for their money and belongings.         
	Raaj Mangal Prasad, vice-president of Pratidhi, suspects that several lakhs, if not crores could have been stolen over the past decade alone.         
	Since January, at least 20-50 beggars are being picked up every day and sent to the homes, where one of the first things the officials do is seize their cash, the NGO says. Receipts are supposed to be given but Pratidhi says it depends on the whims and fancies of officials.         
	The rules for running the homes say a beggar is entitled to get back his money and belongings. If a beggar dies or runs away and there are no claimants, the items and the money are to be handed over to police to be disposed of as a magistrate orders.         
	The superintendent of the two reception-cum-classification centres  the homes where beggars are first brought and kept till their cases are on  said he had no records before 2005. From October 20, 2005 to December 2008, he accounted for Rs 1.09 lakh and said it was in a bank.         
	In the Lampur beggar home, where Krishna had served time and which has room for 400 beggars, the officials said they only had Rs 18,159 in unclaimed money. At another home, officials said they only had Rs 69,411, but no records.         
	Sources say the officials lend the cash at high rates of interest or invest them in high-return ventures.

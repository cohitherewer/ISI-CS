The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sex slur strikeback

          MUZAFFAR RAINA                              
	Srinagar, July 29: The National Conference today slapped charges of sexual misconduct on Peoples Democratic Party leader Muzaffar Hussain Baig, who had yesterday triggered a political storm by dragging Omar Abdullahs name in a three-year-old sex scandal that prompted the chief minister to resign on the ground of political probity.         
	Baig came under attack as 12 members of the Congress and National Conference brought a privilege motion against him even as clashes broke out between activists of the ruling coalition and the main Opposition party in several places across Kashmir.        
	Seething from yesterdays attack, National Conference MLAs geared for a fight inside the Assembly. National Conference legislator Nazir Gurezi submitted a questionnaire to speaker Akbar Lone, seeking answers from Baig on the alleged sexual misconduct.         
	The most shocking allegation levelled by Gurezi is the one about Baigs niece. Whether it is not a fact that you kept your niece as your keep for six long years and it was only after she developed some gynaecological problems, you had no option but to formalise the illicit and illegitimate relation with her, he asked.        
	The National Conference leader goes on to ask Baig if it was a fact that he lived with a widow for two years at his New Friends Colony house in New Delhi without marrying her. Whether it is also a fact that differences developed between you and the said lady, once you tried to go in for overtures with the daughter of the said lady? he asked.        
	Baig is also blamed for extra-marital relations with the widow of a forest lessee of Rajbagh (Srinagar), daughter of a retired justice and a sister of a businessman.         
	Baig said the National Conference legislators could go to any extent to harm him. They will go on levelling more charges against me. They will put me behind bars or even burn my house, he told The Telegraph.

                                                                                                               Companies ask for CISF shield
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 31: Leading private companies in India have asked for protection by the Central Industrial Security Force, the 39-year old agency that now controls access to only government and public establishments.         
	Software giant Infosys, the Tata Group and a refinery in Jamnagar are among the private establishments that have approached the government for CISF cover, home minister P. Chidambaram said today.         
	But the government will be able to extend CISF cover to the private sector only after Parliament passes an amendment bill introduced by the home ministry this month to facilitate the use of the protection force at private and joint venture establishments for a fee.         
	The CISF, set up in 1969, now provides security to 59 airports, atomic energy and space establishments, oil refineries and other key public sector installations.        
	The force has a staff strength of about 109,000 but the government has approved a plan to add 40,000 recruits over the next two years.        
	I would like to pass an ordinance (on the CISF amendment), but cant say whether I can, Chidambaram told reporters.        
	CISF cadres have superior levels of training, discipline and motivation which make them more effective than private agencies, a senior official said. They are also able to carry weapons, he said.         
	A previous change in laws governing the CISF had allowed the agency to provide consultancy services to the private sector.        
	We have been sharing security expertise, but not deploying any manpower, the CISF official said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Central rule for Ranchi
                                                                                                               Central rule for Ranchi
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 19: Unable to find a consensus candidate to replace the defeated Shibu Soren, the Centre today decided to impose Presidents rule in Jharkhand, ending a fortnights political uncertainty.        
	The Assembly has been put in suspended animation, although Congress sources here suggest Jharkhand is headed for fresh polls along with the general election.        
	In opting out of exploring the possibility of forming a new government, the UPA, of which Sorens Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) is a part, has tried to cut its losses in Jharkhand ahead of the general election.        
	Although Soren was keen to install party colleague Champai Soren in his place, the growing view, especially in the Congress, was that extending the JMMs current lease in power would further erode the UPAs credibility in the state.        
	Shibu Sorens humiliating defeat in the Tamar by-election on January 8 was itself being seen as an angry riposte to an unpopular and corrupt government.        
	Not interested in entertaining Soren beyond a point, the UPA government quickly disposed of the issue in an early morning cabinet meeting and decided to go for central rule. The home ministry cleared the file by evening.        
	Till Saturday, hopes that a new UPA government could be formed had rested on Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad, who was travelling abroad. Lalu Prasad had engineered a deal to install the Independent Madhu Koda as UPA-supported chief minister after the BJP lost the numbers game in the state.        
	Since the Assembly will remain in suspended animation, the JMM still hopes it can stake claim to form the government at a later date, party sources said. With a year to go before the Assemblys term expires, chances are that political activity to get a new chief minister will start soon.        
	Soren was in mourning as his brother died today, but party leaders said over the phone from Ranchi that he may still make it to Delhi on Wednesday and meet Lalu Prasad and Sonia Gandhi in an effort to rekindle his bid for power. Till the three leaders sit and talk, we still have hope, a JMM legislator said.        
	But this time, even Lalu Prasad doesnt appear too keen on installing a new government because its stability will be suspect. The RJD was not averse at one stage to putting up its own man as chief minister with support from the JMM, Congress and smaller UPA allies, but that was never a realistic possibility.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Village diktat: vote or pay fine
                                                                                                               Village diktat: vote or pay fine
          GAJINDER SINGH                               
	Chandigarh, May 5: Cast your vote, save your pocket.        
	A Haryana village council has ordered residents to turn up at polling booths on May 7, and in every election from now on, even if it means missing a days earnings.         
	Those who dont will have to pay a penalty, starting with Rs 100.         
	We have always been blamed for turning out in small numbers. But this time we intend to make a statement. All residents with voting rights have decided they will vote on May 7 when the state goes to the polls, sarpanch Mange Ram said from Jallopur, a village of 1,400 voters in Fatehabad district.        
	Ram, who graduated with English as one of his subjects, said the decree was aimed at showing the rest of the country that voting is important, forgetting that freedom of choice in a democracy also involved the right not to choose.        
	So what made the panchayat issue the diktat in a village where 70 per cent people live below the poverty line and a days work can make the difference between hunger and going to bed with food in the stomach? Apparently, a ban on DJs, if Ram is to be believed.        
	A few months ago, Jallopur, about 250km from Chandigarh, had shut DJs out from the village because the music was hurting the cows. Not only were they keeping awake at night, they were also giving less milk.         
	The ban set me thinking that if we could control noise pollution, we can, if we have the will, set our lives in order.... The Lok Sabha polls have given us yet another opportunity (to do so).         
	We can forgo a days labour... to elect our government. After all, the majority of the schemes benefiting the poor come from the Centre, he said.        
	The sarpanch, however, has been careful not to decree which party to vote for. Our intention was to get everyone to vote, not to... force anyone to vote for a particular candidate. That is their right.

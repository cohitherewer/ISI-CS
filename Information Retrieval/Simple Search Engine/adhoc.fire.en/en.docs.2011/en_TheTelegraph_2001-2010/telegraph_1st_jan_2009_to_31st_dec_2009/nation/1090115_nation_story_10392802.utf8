The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | War last option, says cautious army chief
                                                                                                               War last option, says cautious army chief
          SUJAN DUTTA                           Kapoor at the news conference. (Rajesh Kumar)                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 14: Army chief General Deepak Kapoor today said the fighting option would be exercised as a last resort after all measures to coerce Pakistan to act against terrorists have failed.         
	General Deepak Kapoor, addressing a ritual news conference to celebrate the annual Army Day ceremony, was unusually cautious and deliberately refrained from making hawkish statements on war against Pakistan.         
	The last time an Indian Army chief spoke publicly as India-Pakistan tensions were peaking (and Operation Parakram was on) was on January 11, 2002.         
	Yes. Affirmative. Complete. Ready, General Sundarrajan Padmanabhan, then army chief, had shot back when asked if India was prepared to go on the offensive against Pakistan in the wake of the Parliament attack of December 2001.         
	Reminded of that statement, Kapoor today responded: If I say, yes, will you be satisfied?         
	We are keeping all options open... waging war is a political decision, he added.         
	The two statements by the two army chiefs, seven years apart, signpost how different the attitudes of the NDA government of 2002 and the UPA government of 2008 are.         
	In 2002, General Padmanabhan was barrelling military might into a policy of coercive diplomacy that achieved little result. Now, the Centre is looking for options since the Mumbai attacks of November 2008, even two months afterwards, before laying down a policy that is coherent to the public.         
	Union home minister P. Chidambaram has given a hint of what direction Indias Pakistan policy could take in the short term if Islamabad failed to respond to the demands that it should crack down on terror. Curtailing or severing diplomatic and trade links are among them. But foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee is maintaining a hard line.         
	There is a continuing pattern of evasiveness and denial in Pakistans response to the terrorist attack on Mumbai. We have asked their government to undertake investigations in Pakistan and to share the results with us so as to bring the perpetrators to justice, Mukherjee said today.        
	Kapoor said the Indian Army had taken note of Pakistans redeployment of troops from its border with Afghanistan to the border with India. The movement of Pakistani troops has been factored into our planning, he said.        
	The army chief admitted that the Indian Army was trying to implement a doctrinal change since 2002. The new doctrine of cold start  that envisages that the army can go into operations without a full-scale mobilisation  was an example that the Indian Army was dynamic, he said.         
	But Kapoor was deliberately distancing himself from warlike rhetoric. We are all aware that there has been a larger amount of tension.... There is no need for war hysteria.

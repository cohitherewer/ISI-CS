	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 22: The BJP in Orissa today suffered a major setback with senior party leader and former MP M.A. Kharavela Swain quitting the saffron outfit, protesting over-dominance and undue interference of the RSS.        
	The RSS is physically controlling the BJP and imposing its decision on the party, alleged Swain, while announcing his decision to quit the party at a news conference here today.        
	Efforts are also on to persuade Swain  who was a BJP member for more than 20 years and represented it in the Lok Sabha consecutively for 11 years  to reconsider his decision, sources said. BJP president Nitin Gadkaris emissary, senior leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, arrived here this afternoon, but left in the evening without a word with Swain.        
	However, Swain said he had no alternative but to sever the ties with the party he served so long. The dominance of RSS is so strong that stalwarts like L.K. Advani have lost grip over the party. Even the new BJP president, Gadkari, was imposed on the party by the RSS and not chosen by party leaders, he alleged.        
	Swain said the RSS leadership in the state had promoted those people in his parliamentary constituency in Balasore, who were involved in attacking his house and also in anti-party activities during the last Lok Sabha elections.        
	The rebels were given patronage during the recent organisational elections and offered prime posts in the district, he added.        
	Swain announced that he would float a new party within 15 to 30 days to provide an alternative to the ruling Biju Janata Dal. Orissa will not prosper till Naveen Patnaik is at the helm, he said.        
	His announcement came hours before the nomination of BJP state unit president. BJP vice-president and former Union minister Juel Oram was unanimously nominated as the state unit chief. Swain, who was aspirant for the post, however, denied that he was quitting the party because he was denied the plum post.         
	Describing Swains move as unfortunate, outgoing BJP state president Suresh Pujari said he had not received any resignation letter from the former MP so far. I came to know about his resignation from the media, he told The Telegraph.         
	Reacting to Swains allegation about RSS interference, Pujari said he had never faced any problem during his tenure as the state president. Naqvi said: RSS appears good when people enjoy power. But when the party goes out of power, they feel bad about RSS.        
	Naqvi, who was the central observer for the organisational polls, said Oram had been elected unanimously as the state president.

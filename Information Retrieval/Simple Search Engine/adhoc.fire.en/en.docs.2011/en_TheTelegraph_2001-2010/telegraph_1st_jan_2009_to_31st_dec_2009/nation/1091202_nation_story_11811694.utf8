The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Age cannot wither them, nor politics stale them
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Age cannot wither them, nor politics stale them
          SANJAY K. JHA                                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 1: Sushma Swarajs dig at Pranab Mukherjees age today raised two questions.        
	Is Mukherjee too old at 74 to handle his job as finance minister and leader of the Lok Sabha?        
	And what about leader of the Opposition L.K. Advani, 82, whom the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh wants to make way for a younger leader while a coterie that includes Sushma is resisting the move?        
	It is bewildering to know that Sushma finds Advani fit enough at 82 to continue and Mukherjee unfit at 74, a senior minister said.        
	Hardly anyone in the political circles thought Mukherjee was too old for his job. The veteran has often earned praise even from Advani, particularly for his mental powers.        
	Congress members at all levels hold Mukherjee in awe and even senior leaders defer to his extraordinary memory.        
	But Sushma, tipped to be the next leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, today said: Pranabda ko aksar gussa aa jata hai. Kuchh to age ka asar hai aur pressure bhi badh jata hai (Mukherjee loses his temper very often. Some of it comes from his advanced age, and his blood pressure rises too).        
	She was responding to a question about Mukherjees tendency to lose his cool, the latest demonstration of which came in the Rajya Sabha today during a discussion on the rising prices of essentials.        
	Sushmas remark triggered questions about leaders in the BJP (Advani) and the Sangh. Current Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat is in his 50s, but traditionally the outfit has been headed by people older than Mukherjee.        
	Sushma promptly argued that the leader in her party (Advani) didnt get angry and never reacted like Mukherjee did. She added that Mukherjees efficiency was not being questioned.        
	Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi thought Sushmas remark didnt deserve a response. On persistent grilling, he said: Talking about Pranabbabus age is in bad taste. She shouldnt have said this. We know who in her party is of what age. This was a cheap comment.        
	Singhvi said that some of Mukherjees comments may have displeased some people but it was wrong to say that the finance minister lost his cool all the time. He is the leader of the Lok Sabha and the senior-most minister and very experienced, he said.        
	Mukherjee carries greater political and administrative burden on his ageing shoulders than any other Indian politician. Apart from being the principal trouble-shooter for the Congress and the government, he heads groups of ministers (GoMs) on dozens of intricate, thorny issues.        
	A senior minister revealed that Mukherjee did most of the talking at cabinet meetings instead of the Prime Minister. Mukherjees stints in the foreign and defence ministries were free of controversy.        
	Congress members admit that the veteran does at times get impatient about mistakes and tells off senior leaders even at Congress Working Committee and cabinet meetings. But, they say, this has been his temperament all along, and linking it to his age is unfair.        
	Atal Bihari Vajpayee, now 85, was in much poorer health than Mukherjee when he was Prime Minister five-and-a-half years ago. George Fernandes, now 79, was another key leader in the NDA government.        
	In the current ministry, S.M. Krishna, who has replaced Mukherjee as foreign minister, is 77. Arjun Singh, 79, was a minister in the previous government. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, 77, too is older than Mukherjee.        
	Motilal Vora, who manages the Congresss finances, is 81. By these yardsticks, Mukherjee has still a long way to go.

	Bhubaneswar, July 16: To educate and empower children coming from families relocated by the upcoming Tata Steel plant at Kalinganagar, the steel behemoth inked an MoU with Bhubaneswar-based Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences (KISS).        
	The children, most of who belong to Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities, will now have an opportunity to receive education at the largest residential tribal school in Asia.        
	The agreement was signed by Tata Steels executive director (India and Southeast Asia), H.M. Nerurkar and KISS founder Achyuta Samanta.        
	KISS is a model institution that offers facilities for technical and higher education based on its unique KG to PG model. The campus houses more than 10,000 students who are provided education and residential accommodation along with vocational training.         
	According to the MoU, KISS and Tata Steel will jointly work in the field of education across the country, giving special attention to the tribal children of displaced communities.         
	Both will work towards mainstreaming the community through advancement in education, technology, research and vocational training. KISS and Tata Steel will work together to promote research on indigenous tribal art and culture.        
	Speaking on the occasion, Nerurkar said education for the underprivileged had been the motto for Tata Steel in its centenary year. In his reference to the KISS association, he said: We share a common goal. Education and mainstreaming can ensure inclusive growth in its true sense.

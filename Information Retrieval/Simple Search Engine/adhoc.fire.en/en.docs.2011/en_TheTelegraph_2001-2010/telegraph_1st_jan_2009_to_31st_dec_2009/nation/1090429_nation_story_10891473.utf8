The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Unsafe puppeteer   Chinks in Modis might
                                                                                                               Unsafe puppeteer     -  Chinks in Modis might
				       SUNANDA K. DATTA-RAY IN AHMEDABAD                              A supporter sports a Modi mask during a roadshow in Kalol near Ahmedabad on Monday. (PTI)				                                       
	Former British Prime Minister Harold Macmillans You never had it so good election slogan applies to the Tatas in Gujarat.        
	In Singur, they would have had to pay Rs 96.72 crore for a 90-year lease of 645 acres. The cost of 1,100 acres in Gujarat is zero, according to a confidential state government Industries and Mines Department document dated January 1, 2009. The astute Narendra Modi achieved this public relations coup by the simple expedient of taking the land away from the Gujarat Agricultural University at Sanand, 30 kilometres from Ahmedabad, and lavishing it free of charge on the Nano plant.        
	In addition, and according to the same document, he has promised to lend the Tatas 330 per cent of their Phase I investment of Rs 2,900 crore at 0.1 per cent simple interest. Work out the quantum of that largesse and then add the huge tax reliefs Modi has also granted!        
	Such grand gestures may not directly impact on the contest for Gujarats 26 Lok Sabha seats which are now more or less evenly divided between the BJP (14) and the Congress (12). But they shore up the boast of rapid modernisation that is belied by urban slums and potholed roads as well as a medieval countryside with herds of camels and donkeys, Ahirs in bright blue and red lungis and the splash of silver chains and medallions called pandul glittering on the hips of wealthy women from certain OBC groups.        
	Clouds of dust gave Modi a sore throat as he addressed a late-evening rally at Bapa Sitaram Chowk, a scruffy marketplace surrounded by shabby buildings in New Naroda on the outskirts of Ahmedabad.        
	We waited for more than an hour, jostled by rough policemen wielding lathis with which they menacingly thwacked the railings every so often, while speaker after speaker croaked away through mouthfuls of dust. Harin Pathak, Ahmedabad Easts BJP candidate and a junior minister in Atal Bihari Vajpayees government, could barely speak above a whisper when I waylaid him. Vibrant Gujarat isnt kind to voice and lungs.        
	The chief ministers cavalcade of 12 vehicles stormed into the square after several false alarms and screeched to a halt. Dapper in crisp white from top to toe despite the stifling heat, Modi jumped out nimbly and ran up the platform stairs to make light of the Election Commissions 10 clock deadline which left only 20 minutes before campaigning had to stop and candidates became mice that roared. Finding the chants of Bharat Mata ki jai! and Vande Mataram! too feeble, he yelled: Say it much louder so that they can hear in Pakistan!         
	The crowd obliged lustily. It laughed uproariously as Modi mimicked the Prime Minister and cheered deafeningly when he misquoted Manmohan Singh to get a dig in about Muslims. It was effective street theatre, choreographed, directed, produced and enacted by a master of the craft. The pity was that the puppeteer did not feel safe with his adoring puppets. A volleyball net stretched tight across the stage to catch stray missiles  like shoes  flying his way.        
	Despite this precaution, theres no denying Modis hold on the public. His economic claims are probably exaggerated but Khurshid Syed, the thin-lipped Congress general secretary, betrays his innocence of popular psychology when he says severely: It did no good inviting the Prime Minister of Kenya to the Vibrant Gujarat conference. Syed missed the enormous PR dividend. Gujaratis loved Kenyas high-powered delegation led by Raila Odinga.        
	Modis achievements are acknowledged in some unlikely quarters. Esther David, writer and activist, a fourth generation Ahmedabadi Beni Israel Jew, recognises his contribution to infrastructure. A. A. Hasan, the Godhra lawyer, was even more forthright. If there was no communalism, I would call him the best administrator, Hasan said, amidst gasps of surprise.        
	Many also debunk his claims. Gujaratis are businessmen, argues a veteran editor, Gujarat has always been economically progressive. The Tatas, Ambanis, Adanis and the Essar Group were already there when Modi took over in 2001. He is reaping the harvest of seeds sown by Jivaraj Mehta, Chimanbhai Patel and Keshubhai Patel.         
	Another chief minister inspired Modis canvassing strategy. Madhavsinh Solanki (who famously dismissed Rajiv Gandhis buddies as the safari-suited brigade and whose son, Bharatsinh, is contesting from Anand) devised the KHAM formula. Naturally, Modi is concentrating only on Kshatriyas, Harijans and Adivasis, not Muslims. Brahmins are not a force in Gujarat; but Kshatriyas and the OBCs are.         
	Several vans daubed with Modis visage and the ever-blooming lotus led me to the BJP office in Ahmedabad. I am one of only two people here who can speak English, (presumably Modi is the other) said Yamal Vyas, the partys cheerfully tubby spokesperson. He has an ironic and unIndian sense of humour. Of a Delhi newspaper that is seen as sympathetic to the BJP, he says: I stopped reading it when it became ours. Good governance and internal security are the two issues at which the BJP is hammering away.        
	Vyass optimism about at least 20 seats might have been plausible six months ago. Now, high unemployment  especially a million workers in the diamond industry which was beginning to lead the world and control Antwerp but crashed with the US market  aggravates the effects of a downturn in agriculture. Many small and medium enterprises have closed down. Only 30 per cent of the multitude of MoUs fructify.         
	Politically, too, Modis position has weakened. Praveen Togadia is not his only fraternal critic. Nor is Suresh Mehta, chief minister for 11 months in 1995-96, the only BJP rebel. Others led by Gordhanbhai Zadaphia, home minister during the post-Godhra massacre, are giving the ruling party a run for its money. Their Maha Gujarat Janta Party may not win any of the 16 seats it is contesting but is bound to split the Hindutva vote.        
	The Congress should benefit. Even if it doesnt get at least 18 seats, as Syed predicts, it may add one or two to its tally. Congress lost the Dahod reserved constituency by only 421 votes in 2004. Surendranagars Congress candidate, Somabhai Patel, was twice BJP MP before being expelled for supporting the UPA trust motion. More scams and scandals seem to mark BJP candidates. Pathak was accused of murdering a policeman. Godhras Prabhatsinh Chauhan was implicated in a Rs 260-crore co-operative bank swindle.        
	But Modi still has the edge. Not because of anything he has done for Gujarat. But because of who he is, what he represents and how he packages himself. Such is the quality of his appeal that Mondays Supreme Court directive can only increase the fervour of his supporters.        
	 Gujarat votes on April 30

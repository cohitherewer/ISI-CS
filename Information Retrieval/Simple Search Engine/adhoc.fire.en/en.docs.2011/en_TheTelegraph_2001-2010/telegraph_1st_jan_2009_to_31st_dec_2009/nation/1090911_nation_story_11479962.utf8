The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sangh keeps thorns away
                                                                                                               Sangh keeps thorns away
  - Duo left out to ensure neutral talks        RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                    
	New Delhi, Sept. 10: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh left two of its point men on the BJP out of its thinkers meet for fear that their presence would hit the credibility of its efforts to clean up the party.        
	Senior swayamsevak Madan Das Devi and Sangh No. 3 Suresh Soni are perceived to have often pursued their own agendas instead of the Sangh mandate and, in the process, got sucked into the BJPs coterie politics.        
	The two-day sitting in Utan, a Mumbai suburb, that ended today was meant to discuss the state of the BJP and draw the outlines of a revival plan through free-wheeling discussions, sources said.        
	Sangh chief Mohanrao Bhagwat was apparently keen that his message of will advise the BJP only if it is solicited should not get diluted through the presence of politicking representatives. He wanted the discussions to be neutral, a source said.        
	Devi was the Sanghs conduit to the BJP when the NDA was in power. K.S. Sudarshan, then Sangh chief, was said to be unhappy with the numerous truces Devi struck with the Vajpayee government just when Sudarshan and hard-line parivar lobbies hoped to take a tough stand on issues such as Ayodhya and PSU divestment.        
	There was a feeling that Devi had departed from the directives from Keshav Kunj (the Sangh headquarters), a source said.        
	Soni is seen as having played BJP factions against each other. Uma Bharti has accused him of scuttling her plans to return to the BJP.         
	Soni is said to have catalysed Rajnath Singhs appointment as party president but abandoned him mid-stream and cosied up to his rivals.        
	Devis well-wishers, however, argued he was one of the few within the Sangh who understood a coalition governments compulsions.         
	Devi, a lateral entrant from student wing ABVP, was also accused of being alien to the Sanghs culture of iron discipline.        
	He pushed appointments in government and patronised friends and acquaintances, a source said. Devi was not available for comment.        
	Devi had been crucial in making L.K. Advani the Deputy Prime Minister and has been, willy-nilly, dubbed a friend of Advani.        
	He never regained the clout he had during the six years of NDA rule. He is now a pracharak pramukh and out of Bhagwats panchayat.         
	However, in the past month or so, when Bhagwat involved himself with the BJP, Devi had resurfaced, hoping to leverage his links with the leaders to regain importance.        
	It seems the sarsanghachalak (Bhagwat) has nipped his ambitions, a source said.        
	Soni, a joint secretary, continues as the Sanghs interface with the BJP but Bhagwat had asked him to stay out of the partys Shimla chintan baithak to retain the Sanghs non-political veneer. His colleague Dattatraya Hosable got invited to the Sangh thinkers conclave.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 14: Defence minister A.K. Antony today ruled out combat roles for women in the armed forces but said the avenues for recruiting women in the military would be widened.        
	At present, there is no proposal to induct women into combat duties in the defence forces, including that of fighter pilots in Indian Air Force, Antony told Parliament in reply to a question.        
	In future, the defence minister said it was possible that women would be given combat duties too. I agree that they are brave women... and gradually they will be able to join combat areas also, he said.        
	Speaker Meira Kumar said she shared the defence ministers view.         
	BJP leader Sushma Swaraj had asked if the government was raising special battalions with women officers.        
	The defence minister said internal recommendations from within the armed forces had not favoured combat duties for women.        
	A study carried out by Headquarters Integrated Defence Staff in 2006 on all aspects of employment of women officers in the armed forces recommended exclusion of women officers from close combat roles, the defence minister said.        
	...But this is not final. We are committed. We are sincere and I am sure that in course of time they will be able to join combat duties. Gradually, we are moving towards that, he added.        
	In statistics he presented to the House, the minister said 398 women officers were recruited in 2007, 399 in 2008 and 432 (half-year) in 2009.        
	Congress MP Manish Tiwari said he was concerned that the proportion of women in the armed forces was not increasing.        
	Minister of state for defence Pallam Raju said: Most of the women are meeting the benchmarks. It is only because streams are limited, and we are making efforts to expand them from time to time.

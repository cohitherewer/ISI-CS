The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | RS scan on reality shows
                                                                                                               RS scan on reality shows
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           A poster of the show Sach Ka Saamna                                  
	New Delhi, July 22: The government has agreed to a discussion in the Rajya Sabha on TV reality shows after several members demanded censorship, alleging some of the programmes had indecent content and were not favourable for family viewing.        
	Kamal Akhtar of the Samajwadi Party had raised the matter during zero hour today, saying the government should censor shows that promoted obscenity and went against family values.        
	The other day I was watching a show. A woman was present on the show along with her husband and other family members. The anchor asked her whether in her mind she wanted to have a physical relation with anyone other than her husband. She said No. Then there was a lie-detector test, which said what she had said was a lie. Imagine the embarrassment of the woman, Akhtar said.        
	He also alleged that some TV serials seemed to suggest child marriages are good and that mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law should always be fighting.        
	Akhtar did not name the reality show or serials but appeared to be referring to Sach Ka Saamna, which airs on STAR Plus and uses a lie-detector test, and Balika Badhu, a soap about a child bride which completed one year this week on Colors.        
	All the BJP members supported Akhtar.        
	The minister of state for parliamentary affairs, Prithviraj Chavan, then rose to say that he had taken note of the members sentiments and the government was ready for a House discussion.        
	Those involved in the TV programmes were guarded.        
	Anita Kaul Basu, director of Synergy Communications which produces Sach Ka Saamna, told The Telegraph: We have the utmost regard for Rajya Sabha proceedings. Censorship of the media is a larger issue, but we would not like to comment on the proceedings at this juncture.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bengal NSG kickoff minus PC 
                                                                                                               Bengal NSG kickoff minus PC

	New Delhi, June 29: P. Chidambaram may have sent his troops to Bengal to fight the Maoists but is himself giving the miss to a high-profile security event in Calcutta.        
	The Union home minister will inaugurate three of the countrys four new National Security Guard (NSG) hubs over the next two days, avoiding only the fourth  the one in the Bengal capital.        
	The Mumbai hub will be operationalised tomorrow and those at Chennai, Hyderabad and Calcutta the day after. Chidambaram will arrive in Mumbai tomorrow and fly to Chennai and Hyderabad on Wednesday before straightaway returning to Delhi.        
	The hub at Kaikhali (near Calcutta airport) will, therefore, have to be inaugurated by NSG director-general N.P.S. Aulakh, sources said.        
	Although Chidambaram has attributed his decision to incompatible programme timings and flight schedules, some home ministry officials are inclined to see it as a snub to Bengal.        
	They cite how sections within the CPM and its Left Front allies have been consistently sniping at the Centres ban on the Maoists. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, however, has from the beginning said he would enforce the ban, and the CPM too has now endorsed his stand.        
	Chidambaram today blamed the Bengal governments indifference for the Maoists gaining a foothold in the state in the last 10 years, a PTI report said. Officials here, however, acknowledged that the home ministry was now happy with the state governments role in the Lalgarh operation over the past few days.        
	Chidambaram, explaining his decision to skip the Calcutta NSG inauguration, had said last week: Earlier, there used to be a Hyderabad-Calcutta flight, which has now been cancelled. I cant take the plane (to Calcutta) for one person.        
	There are two morning flights from Hyderabad to Calcutta and one at 8.45pm. With the Hyderabad programme tentatively scheduled around noon, the home minister would have needed to wait several hours if he decided to catch the evening flight to Calcutta. Chidambaram prefers commercial flights for official programmes to cut costs.        
	Bengal home secretary Ardhendu Sen said: We have been informed that the Union home minister would not be coming because his presence is required in Delhi.        
	The Centre had decided to set up the four regional hubs after the 26/11 Mumbai attacks, when it had taken nine hours to get the elite NSG commandos to the scene of action from their lone centre in Delhi. The hubs are located at Marol (23 acres) in Mumbai, Nedunkundram (85 acres) in Chennai, Trimulghery (22 acres) in Hyderabad and Kaikhali (20 acres). The Calcutta and Hyderabad hubs will later be upgraded to regional centres.

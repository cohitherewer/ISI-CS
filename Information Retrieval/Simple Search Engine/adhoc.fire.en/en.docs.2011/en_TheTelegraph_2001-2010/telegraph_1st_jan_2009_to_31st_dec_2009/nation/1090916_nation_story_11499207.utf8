	Patna, Sept. 15: An eight-year-old boys kidnapping has got Nitish Kumar worried.        
	The Bihar chief minister came to power in 2005 on a promise to wipe out abductions  a flourishing underworld business  from the state, especially its capital. But Shresth Sanjays abduction yesterday morning so unnerved the man who promised susashan (good governance) that he ordered police officers to prioritise the case even as the men in khaki were busy on bypoll duty today.        
	A Class III student, Shresth was kidnapped at gunpoint near a five-star hotel on Frazer Road while he was on way to Christ Church School in an autorickshaw with seven other children.        
	This morning, Nitish called senior police officers, directing the Patna inspector-general and deputy inspector-general to use all possible tools at the disposal of the forces to rescue the boy and arrest the abductors.        
	I want the abducted kid back home and criminals arrested at any cost, Nitish sternly told director-general of police Anand Shankar, directing him to use the CID and special branch if necessary. We are hopeful that we will make a headway in the case soon, additional director-general (police headquarters) Neelmani hoped.        
	The police, in spite of raids and searhces in 30 places in and around Patna, are yet to find a clue about Shresths kidnappers.        
	Preliminary investigations reveal that the criminals had planned their operation meticulously. They kidnapped Shresth on the eve of the by-elections in Patnas Phulwari Sharief Assembly constituency in which the police had deputed most of their men.        
	Moreover, Shresths father, Sanjay Kumar Shrivastava, an executive with a private company, was away in Ranchi yesterday. Kalpana, his mother, was only there to see Shresth off to school. The investigating officers said that the criminals must have been keeping a watch on the movement of the family members.        
	In 2007, criminals had abducted Akash Pandey, a student of DAV School, in similar fashion. There is no trace of Akash still.        
	Over the years, the number of kidnappings had come down drastically, which may have prompted parents to let down their guard, felt officers investigating the Shresth case. May be thats why criminals were able to pull off yesterdays abduction with such apparent ease.        
	The police today sent a team to Nayagaon, the ancestral village of Shresth, to find out if the family had personal enmity with anyone. But Kalpana said: We dont have personal or professional enmity with anyone.        
	Panic has gripped the city with parents fearing the return of the dark days of rampant kidnappings  the hallmark of a regime that Nitish sought to replace.        
	This morning, several parents were seen personally dropping their children to school with investigating officers questioning several three-wheeler operators.        
	Leader of Opposition Rabri Devi said that Shresths abduction had put a big question mark on the Nitish governments claim about susashan. But the fact remains that in 2004, the last year of her regime, more than 20 students kidnappings were reported from Patna.

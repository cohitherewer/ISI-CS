	I just played Solitaire on my computer. And goddammit Obama won that too. Imagine a typo on the Nobel certificate that gives peace prize to Osama.

	Oh, ok, theyve reversed their decision. Turns out Kanye West has won this years Nobel Peace Prize. He says Beyonce deserved it, though. I hear next weeks special item on Mafia Wars is a Nobel Peace Prize.

	Too bad Obama didnt win an Emmy two weeks ago, thats what he was really shooting for with all those TV appearances. Nobel will have to do.
  MicahelRWarren, student, Ireland        
	Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize? For what? Not being George Bush?
  Chandlerepp, critic, Atlanta USA        
	If Obama won the Nobel Prize for peace, I should have won it for physics. Our contributions are about the same.
  Madhu Menon, Bangalore        
	President Obama winning the Nobel Peace Prize is like an artist with only one single out winning a Grammy.
  Chloe Carter, USA        
	Obama wins Nobel Peace??? Is this a joke of some sort??? If ever I thought the world had gone stark, raving mad, this must be that moment.
  Indian post graduate student at Stanford        
	Obama, Peace Prize. Where did he bring peace...? Chicago? What a joke!
  Ronald Bigbie, USA        
	Why not give Obama every single Nobel prize? He must have studied physics and chemistry at some point in his life. And he takes good care of himself so he must know something about medicine. He writes. Hes peaceful. And he manages his own money.... How about some Oscars, and Grammies too! Oh he already has a Grammy.
  Partha Bose, England         
	Obama jus becomes more and more amazing to me....Michelle is one lucky woman!!!

	People talking about what President Obama doesnt deserve, some of yall dont deserve to live, but no one has came and laid you down yet.

	Of course the conservative world will blast Obama for something he had NO control over.

	Heard in the US              
	It would be wonderful if I could think why he won. They wanted to give him an honor I guess but I cant think what for.
  -Claire Sprague, 82, a retired English professor in Manhattan        
	For doing what? The guy hasnt solved any conflict anywhere so how can he win the peace prize? But if we dont re-elect him the next go around we will all look like idiots because the world has anointed him.
  -Robert Schultz, 62, a Vietnam veteran        
	Obama won? Really? Wow. He deserves it I guess, hes the President. Hes a smart guy and I guess hes into peace.

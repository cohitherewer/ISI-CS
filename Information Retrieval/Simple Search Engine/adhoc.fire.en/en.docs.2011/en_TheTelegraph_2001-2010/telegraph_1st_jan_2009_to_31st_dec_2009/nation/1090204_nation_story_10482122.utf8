	Madrid, Feb. 3 (AP): Spanish police have arrested 15 people, including four Indians and one Pakistani, suspected of forging passports and other documents for al-Qaida, news reports said today.         
	At least 10 people were arrested in Barcelona, reports said. Police confirmed an operation was in progress but could not give details. No explosives had been found and the police were searching for a printer used to forge passports.                     
	Elsewhere, four Indians and one Pakistani were arrested in the eastern town of Mislata as part of same operation, a police spokeswoman in the nearby regional capital of Valencia said. She spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with department regulations. Dozens of suspected radical Islamic militants have been arrested in Spain since the September 11, 2001, attacks in New York and Washington, and again after the commuter train bombings in 2004 in Madrid. On January 20, six Pakistanis were arrested in Barcelona on suspicion of tax fraud and diverting funds to Islamic terror groups. They were released days later for lack of evidence.

                                                                                                               Top judge calls meet to settle assets row
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              Balakrishnan, Chatterjee: To disclose or not				                                 
	New Delhi, Jan. 22: Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan has apparently called a meeting of all Supreme Court judges to decide whether they should make their assets public, sources said.        
	The move follows mounting criticism of his stand that such details need not be made public. The meeting, to be held soon, will try to thrash out a consensus among the courts 24 judges, including Balakrishnan.        
	Sources said the mood in the apex court seemed to be veering around to making the disclosures. The details may be posted on the Supreme Court website or the chief justices office may make them public, a source said.        
	Balakrishnan had refused to heed an order by the Central Information Commission (CIC) directing him to reveal asset details of fellow judges. He said the judges had declared their assets voluntarily  in the absence of a law on such disclosures  and he could not make the information public.        
	The Supreme Court registrar has since secured a stay on the CIC order from Delhi High Court. But it is worried that an adverse high court decision would cause it further embarrassment, the sources said. The next hearing is on February 11.        
	The move to convene a meeting comes a day after Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee joined the chorus of criticism against Balakrishnans refusal.        
	There is no law which says you have to be honest. Honesty is not imposed by law, Chatterjee had said, pointing out that even MPs were not required to make their assets public earlier.        
	But when a law (the information act) is made, I started to respect this law, he said.        
	Chatterjees remarks followed Supreme Court lawyer Fali S. Narimans refusal to assist the high court in deciding the appeal by the Supreme Court registrar against the CIC order.        
	Nariman had written to the high court that he could not play the role of a neutral arbiter as he believed that judges, who held public offices, should reveal their assets.

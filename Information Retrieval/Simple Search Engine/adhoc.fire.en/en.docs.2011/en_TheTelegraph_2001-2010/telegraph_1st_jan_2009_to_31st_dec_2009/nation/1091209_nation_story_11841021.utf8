The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CAT firm explains retest pick process
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      CAT firm explains retest pick process
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 8: Common Admission Test service provider Prometric will use reports from its test centre staff to supplement technology in short-listing candidates affected adversely by technical glitches for a retest.         
	On-site reports filed by its test centre staff will be used along with audio and video records of the centres, and electronic records of each candidates performance to identify affected candidates, the firm said today.         
	These site reports, which are filed electronically whenever an issue arises during an exam, will be reviewed to determine the nature and severity of the incident, Ramesh Nava, regional vice-president and general manager, Prometric told The Telegraph.        
	The list of affected candidates will then be presented to the IIMs for a retest, Nava said, in a statement to this newspaper in response to queries.        
	The US-based firm had yesterday placed a public statement on the CAT website where it assured that candidates affected adversely by technical glitches would be identified for a possible retest.        
	Todays statement for the first time officially clarifies how Prometric will try and identify affected candidates.        
	Over 8,000 students could not attempt the test -- which admits students to the IIMs and other top business schools -- in their scheduled slot because of glitches attributed by organisers to viruses.        
	But several hundred other students have complained that glitches placed them at an unfair disadvantage compared to others in the highly competitive test.        
	Some have complained that questions appeared slower on their terminals than was the case with their friends, while others have complained that their test was wrongly declared submitted (completed) prematurely.        
	Candidates have also complained that confusion and chaos at their centre -- because of the glitches affecting others -- prevented them from concentrating on their test.        
	As the test in some slots was delayed, candidates had to wait many hours longer -- than was scheduled -- before taking the test, placing them at a disadvantage as compared to those who did start the test on time.        
	In its statement today, Prometric explained that it plans to use a multi-pronged approach to ensure that any incidences that might have adversely impacted a candidates testing experience are evaluated and addressed.        
	Video and audio records at each test centre will be used to identify centres which suffered from commotion or visible or audible manifestations of problems.        
	On-site records filed by its test centre staff each time a problem arose will be used to identify the specific problem experienced at a particular test centre.        
	Electronic records tracking the performance of each candidate -- when he started the test, how much time he spent on each question and test segment, and when he ended -- will be used to shortlist affected students.        
	By evaluating all of the available information, an informed decision can be reached as to which candidates may have been adversely impacted by the viruses and these individuals will be presented to the IIMs to be offered an opportunity to retest, the firm said.

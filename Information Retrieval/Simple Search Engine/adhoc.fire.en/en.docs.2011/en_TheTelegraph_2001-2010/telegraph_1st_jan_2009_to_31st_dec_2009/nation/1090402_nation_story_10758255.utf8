	Patna, April 1: At one end theres the new BJP hero, Varun Gandhi, and Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi. Ideologically, a binary opposite, and yet a part of the NDA, is Nitish Kumar  the lone leader of the NDA campaign boat in Bihar.        
	Aware of this star status, Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi today made Nitish Kumar and his government his main targets at two campaign meetings held in Aurangabad and Buxar. I saw how the Kosi floods devastated millions. The Centre had sent money and relief, but the goods never reached the people, Rahul said.         
	It is a belief in Bihar that its chief ministers popularity has grown, since he took over the states reigns in 2005. He has succeeded in proving himself distinct from the Lalu-Rabri duo. While voters refer to roads, schools and health centres that the Nitish-led government has built, BJP contenders prefer to dwell more on the governments performance than the contributions made by NDA prime ministerial candidate L.K. Advani, while seeking votes in Bihar.         
	Despite being a star, Nitish is now finding himself spearheading the NDA campaign virtually alone  since the JD(U) leadership has already demanded action on Varun Gandhi for his controversial words and has advised the BJP not to allow its Pilibhit (UP) seat nominee to enter the Bihar poll arena. Narendra Modi has been on Nitishs untouchable list for a long time now.        
	In 2004, however, the campaign scene was different. Nitish had lavishly praised A.B. Vajpayee, when the latter addressed a poll meeting at Patna, while the veteran was also all praises for the chief minister, describing him as the most effective Union minister. Nitish Kumar is missing Vajpayee in this poll season as he does not see anyone fit to substitute for Vajpayee as a leader, said an aide of the Bihar chief minister, who is gearing up to embark on his campaigns from April 4.        
	A part of Nitishs popularity is evident from JD(U)s victories in seven by-elections that were held since he became the chief minister.         
	The party also got the support of minority voters in Manihari, Bhagalpur and Bikramganj seats.         
	The hard-line rhetoric from Varun Gandhi, Rajnath Singh and others, has apparently made Nitish Kumar wary of accompanying the hard-liners.         
	While the chief minister has been left to lead the NDA team alone, his rivals  Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan  have found new weapons in their campaign armoury. While the Congress has the youthful Rahul, Lalu and Paswan have got UP strongman and Samajvadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav to campaign for them.         
	In his three-years of tenure, Nitish Kumars campaign skills and popularity are on the test for the first time. However, talking to The Telegraph, the leader seemed relaxed. I have lived among my people and you have always seen me in the janata ke durbar mein mukhyamantri and in vikas yatras. I do not stay away from the public gaze and appear only during campaign time.        
	New ministers        
	Nitish Kumar today inducted two new ministers after former ministers Nagmani and Nitish Mishra raised the revolt banner and quit. The new ministers who were administered the oath of office and secrecy by Governor R.L. Bhatia, include Devesh Chandra Thakur  a Brahmin  and Renu Kumari  a Kushwaha.         
	In fact, a Brahmin man himself, Nitish Mishra, and a member of the Kushwaha community, Nagmani, quit their posts after being denied the JD(U) ticket.

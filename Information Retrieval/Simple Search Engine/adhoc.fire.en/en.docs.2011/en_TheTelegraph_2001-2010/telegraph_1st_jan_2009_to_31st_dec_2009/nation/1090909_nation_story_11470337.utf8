          OUR BUREAU                              
	Sept. 8: A first-year student in Assam died after a college senior poured kerosene on him and set him on fire for refusing to part with his T-shirt.         
	Nitumoni Das, 20, studying for a major in Assamese in Dimoria College in Kamrup, had gone to friend Prafulla Dass room in their hostel in Sankargog, about 30km from Guwahati.        
	While Nitumoni was in Prafullas room, the senior asked for the younger boys T-shirt. Nitumoni refused and they quarrelled over it. Before he died, Nitumoni told his mother, Moon, that Prafulla set him on fire after he refused to give him his T-shirt, a police officer said.         
	Prafulla, 21, a second-year pass course student, is absconding.         
	When the incident took place, second-year student Maram Boro, Prafullas roommate, was present. We are probing if he too is involved, the officer said.        
	Maram surrendered before the police this morning and is being questioned.         
	Prafulla and Nitumoni were friends. I cant believe he killed my son, Moon cried.        
	The police said they found liquor bottles in Prafullas room and suspect he was drunk.         
	But it was Maram and Prafulla who rushed the victim to Gauhati Medical College and Hospital in an ambulance, the police officer said.         
	Nitumonis father Anil Das said Prafulla called up around 4pm and told him his son had met with an accident and asked him to come to Gauhati Medical College and Hospital. The boy was later shifted to Dispur Hospital where he died.

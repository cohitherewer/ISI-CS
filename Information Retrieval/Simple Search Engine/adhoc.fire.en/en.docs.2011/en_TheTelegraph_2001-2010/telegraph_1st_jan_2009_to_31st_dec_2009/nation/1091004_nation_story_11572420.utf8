                                                                                                               Delhi Metro crane topples
                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 3 (PTI) A crane overturned at a Metro construction site in south Delhi today, but no one was injured.         
	The accident took place at the under-construction Saket Metro station when a 50-tonne capacity crane, which was lifting a smaller capacity crane, developed a mechanical problem.        
	It (smaller crane) overturned as one of the cylinders used for lifting the boom (lifting arm) of the bigger crane failed, Metro spokesperson Anuj Dayal said.        
	The mishap comes three weeks after a Metro train derailed.

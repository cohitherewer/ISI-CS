The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Varun vows to follow father
                                                                                                               Varun vows to follow father
          OUR BUREAU                          Varun campaigns in Pilibhit on Saturday. (PTI)                                  
	Pilibhit, May 9: Sanjay Gandhi was blamed for a policy which forced thousands of men and some women to be sterilised to meet government quotas.         
	In an interview with The Daily Telegraph, son Varun, 29, said he hoped to follow in his fathers footsteps by one day offering the strong leadership which he said India had lacked for 20 years.        
	Late tonight, Varun issued a denial that he had spoken in favour of forced sterilisation. The BJPs candidate from Pilibhit said he had not spoken of reviving any previous sterilisation programme or policy but had only said he favoured a sensible family planning programme through education, awareness and incentives.        
	The British daily also quoted Varun, who is contesting his first Lok Sabha election, as saying he would propose a bill in Parliament to introduce compulsory military service for all Indians.         
	In the interview, Varun, who has been charged with making hate speeches, denied he had ever threatened Muslims.         
	But at campaign rallies in Pilibhit today, he said: If I am a Hindu and have talked about Hindutva, then what crime I have committed?         
	He also promised to work like my father.        
	Taken into custody for the speeches in which he allegedly threatened to cut off the hands of Muslims, Varun spent nearly three weeks in jail after the National Security Act was invoked against him.        
	My jail term brought tears in the eyes of my mother Maneka Gandhi. The BSP government will now have to account for her tears, he said today.

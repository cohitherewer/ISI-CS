          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 28: A dawn-to-dusk bandh was observed in south Orissa today in response to a call given by CPI(ML) and other Left and revolutionary mass organisations in protest against police excesses in Narayanpatna-Bandhugaon area of Koraput district, even as explosives and Maoist fatigues were recovered from Bandhugaon area during a joint combing operation.        
	The bandh was called in protest against the killing of two activists of the Maoist-backed Chasi Mulia Adivasi Sangh in a police firing on November 20. The police opened fire at a mob that attacked Narayanpatna police station in an alleged bid to loot arms.        
	In Rayagada district, more than 100 bandh supporters were arrested while staging a blockade at Kapilas Square. Road blockades were also held at Gunupur town. Bandh supporters also felled trees at several places to block arterial roads in the region, police sources said. In Daringibadi area of Kandhamal district, shops were closed and vehicles stopped plying.        
	However, there was lukewarm response to the bandh call at Berhampur town. Shops and business establishments remained open. But a rally was taken out and a meeting was held in support of the bandh.         
	The bandh passed off more or less peacefully with no incident of violence reported from the region, said deputy inspector-general of police Sanjeeb Kumar Panda, adding that adequate precautionary measures had been taken.        
	Today, four guns, eight Claymore mines and about 2.5kg of explosives were recovered from Bandhugaon during a joint combing operation, said Koraput superintendent of police Deepak Kumar. Besides, 150 pairs of Maoist uniforms, one wireless communication set and Maoist literature were found, he added.

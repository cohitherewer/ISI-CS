          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 29: Like most students across the country, aspirants in Orissa confronted technical glitches during the first online Common Admission Test for the second day today.        
	While server crash remained the major problem, a few students alleged that they were not allowed to sit for the tests, though they came on time. It was mentioned in the admit cards to report two hours before the start of the exam. But we were not allowed to enter the campus even though we arrived much before, Binita Jena, a student, complained. The gates at Silicon Engineering College were locked and no one addressed our grievance, Purnachandra Mishra, a guardian, said.         
	At least 18 students could not appear for the tests owing to server failure today during the first part of the test.

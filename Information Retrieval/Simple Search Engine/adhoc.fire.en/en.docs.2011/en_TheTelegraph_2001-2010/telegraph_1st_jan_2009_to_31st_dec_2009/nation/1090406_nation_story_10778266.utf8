                                                                                                               BJD man pins hopes on Naveen
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, April 5: Battlelines for the elections to the Cuttack Lok Sabha seat have become clear with the filing of nominations by candidates of all three major parties  BJD, BJP and the Congress.        
	BJD candidate Bhatruhari Mahtab, the son of former chief minister Harekrushna Mahtab, is seeking re-election after winning from here in the past three elections.         
	Mahtab apparently hopes to cash in on the palpable popularity of BJD chief Naveen Patnaik and his clean, pro-people and development oriented government in the state. Sahu, on the other hand, exudes confidence based on plans to reap the benefits of his past links and support base both within the Congress and BJP. I know a sizeable support base spread across the seven Assembly segments of the constituency want me. I pin my hopes on them, Sahu said.         
	Pitted against him is twice elected parliamentarian Anadi Sahu on a BJP ticket. Sahu had left the post of inspector-general of police in 1996 to fight Biju Patnaik as a Congress candidate from Cuttack. Although he had lost against Biju, he managed to win from the seat in the in October 1996 by-election. Sahu had managed to win the Berhampur seat as the BJP candidate in 1999. Later he had joined the NCP.         
	The Congress, on the other hand, has fielded Bibhuti Bhusan Mishra, who had fought for the party unsuccessfully from the Athagarh Assembly constituency in 2004.         
	Also in the fray is Gopal Kar on a BSP ticket. Kar had joined the Congress after being promised a party ticket in 2004 elections.         
	He resigned from the Congress after being denied a ticket to join the BSP.        
	Out of the constituencys seven Assembly segments, five are represented by the BJD, while one each is with the Congress and BJP. But delimitation had changed the electoral matrix in the constituency. While Khandapada Assembly segment had been added to the Cuttack Lok Sabha seat, the Salipur seat was included in the Kendrapada Lok Sabha seat.         
	Under the delimitation process, the Choudwar Assembly seat was abolished and two new Assembly constituencies  Barabati Cuttack and Choudwar Cuttack  were carved out of earlier Cuttack City Assembly seat.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mehndi driver held in IIM murder case 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Mehndi driver held in IIM murder case 
          RASHEED KIDWAI                              Amrata Pancholi, Anil Patel				                                 
	Bhopal, Dec. 22: The mehndi on a male campus employees feet has apparently helped police crack the murder of IIM Indore assistant professor Amrata Pancholi.        
	Officers today said institute driver Anil Patel had killed her for money, and then applied mehndi to his feet after reading in the papers that the police had found footprints at the crime scene.        
	Inspector-general of police (IGP) Sanjay Rana claimed Patel had confessed to killing the 32-year-old victim at her campus flat on Thursday night after she refused to part with her ATM card and PIN number.        
	Sources said the IIM had suspended Patel in 2003 for alleged thefts on the campus. Pancholis relatives are outraged that the institute continued to employ a person accused of crime.        
	If the detection work almost mirrors a Sherlock Holmes story, theres a flip side too: officers failed explain why they had earlier ruled out a robbery motive and harped on revenge by a spurned suitor.        
	The police had claimed that only two cellphones had been stolen from Pancholis flat, but now say some jewellery too is missing.        
	Patel, a 30-year-old father of three, was picked up yesterday along with a gardener. When he was called for questioning and asked to take off his shoes, the sleuths were amused to see the mehndi.        
	In Indore, men apply mehndi either as a cooling agent in summer or on the day of their wedding. Since its winter now, the mehndi raised suspicion and Patel broke under questioning, the police said.        
	The mehndi wouldnt have helped, though, if forensic experts had tried to match the footprints.        
	 IGP Rana said the sleuths had zeroed in on Patel after he sold the mobiles in the Indore grey market through his friend Bhavesh Soni, a first-year BSc student. The vendor who bought the cellphones had apparently insisted on Sonis photo identity, which helped the investigation.        
	Soni and Patels wife have been arrested too. The murder weapon, with which Pancholi was stabbed over a dozen times, mostly in the lower abdomen, has been recovered from Patels wife, the police said.        
	According to IGP Rana, the sequence of events on Thursday night was like this:        
	Pancholi developed a flat tyre in her Alto and gave the car keys to Patel so he could change the tyre. The key ring had the house keys too.        
	Patel later opened the rear gate of her flat, took off his shoes and hid himself inside, intending theft. When the victim returned after 9pm, he waited for her to fall asleep.        
	But she got up late at night and there was a scuffle. The driver demanded her ATM card and PIN number. When she refused, he kept stabbing her till she fell silent.        
	The killer lingered in the house, leaving only in the early hours. He returned to the scene of crime when police arrived.        
	Another IIM Indore driver, Radheshyam Verma, said Patel had been with the institute for the past 10 years and drew a monthly salary of Rs 12,000.        
	Asked if he believed that his colleague was the killer, he said: Only God knows. But I know he was suspended for an alleged theft six years ago.

                                                                                    Sunday , November 15 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Centre cool, TN cash for Lankan refugees
          G.C. SHEKHAR                          Karunanidhi                                  
	Chennai, Nov. 14: The DMK government has rolled out the cash carpet for Sri Lankan Tamil refugees, offering them a Rs 100-crore package to make their stay in the state comfortable.        
	The largesse announced by chief minister M. Karunanidhi follows his appeal to the Centre to grant permanent resident status to the one lakh refugees living in camps and outside them.         
	Till that happens, the guests from across the Palk Strait will enjoy some of the free benefits available to citizens of the state  from free TVs to medical insurance and even marriage assistance for young women.         
	Opening the purse strings of his government for the Lankan Tamils may be easier for the DMK chief than convincing the Centre to provide permanent status to them. Although his party came up with the demand more than a month ago, the Centre has so far not responded other than home minister P. Chidambaram making the cryptic remark that the demand would be considered.        
	The Centre may not like to open a Pandoras box by granting permanent status to Lankan Tamils selectively as it could open up similar demands for Bangladeshi refugees and Tibetans in the country.         
	The Congress, an ally of the DMK, has been silent, but political parties in Tamil Nadu have criticised the move, saying it could lead to ethnic cleansing in Sri Lanka with the Sinhalese being tempted to send more Lankan Tamils out of their country to the state.        
	The bounty, decided at a Cabinet meeting yesterday, follows a visit to Sri Lanka by a team of state MPs, who studied the living conditions of internally displaced Tamils housed in refugee camps on the island since the end of the war with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).        
	After learning of their plight, it suddenly dawned on Karunanidhi that the living conditions of Lankan refugees in state-run camps in Tamil Nadu were equally pitiable with leaking roofs and stinking toilets.        
	So he sent his ministers to inspect each of the 115 refugee camps, in which 19,340 Lankan Tamil families accounting for 73,241 individuals have been living for nearly four years after the war between the Lankan armed forces and the LTTE resumed in 2005.         
	The ministers reported that the buildings in the camps were in shoddy state and highlighted the practical problems faced by the refugees.         
	The report spurred Karunanidhi to announce the Rs 100-crore package.        
	Of this, Rs 54.6 crore will be used for constructing permanent houses while the remaining Rs. 45.4 crore is for improving amenities and implementing some of the welfare schemes available to the poor in the state.         
	As part of this, the government will provide Rs 1 crore for coverage under the Kalaignar Insurance Scheme for life saving treatments and Rs 4.54 crore for distribution of free colour television sets.        
	Students in the camps, who attend schools and colleges in the state, will be provided free bus passes while about 1,200 young women will be eligible for Rs 20,000 as marriage assistance under a scheme available for poor women in Tamil Nadu.         
	We are pleased that the Lankan Tamils will be able to live more comfortably in the camps though the abiding feeling in their hearts is to return to their homeland, said S.C. Chandrahasan, convener of the Organisation for Eelam Refugees Rehabilitation.

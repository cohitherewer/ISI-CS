          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                
	New Delhi, Nov. 16: The Centre has warned that Mumbais Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (Barc) faces a terror threat, triggering a security boost at the facility and other nuclear units.        
	The alert comes a fortnight after the Barc celebrated founder Homi Bhabhas 100th birth anniversary and weeks after warnings of another 26/11-type attack.         
	The concerns have been fuelled by the fact that the Barc is located close to the Arabian Sea.         
	Vigil has also been stepped up at the Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre and Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics in Calcutta and Barcs Visakhapatnam facility.        
	A home ministry official clarified that the threat is primarily to Barc. He also said it wasnt linked to David Headley, said to have done a recce in Mumbai.         
	Officials didnt name the outfit that posed the threat, but sources said the Lashkar, blamed for 26/11, and Jaish-e-Mohammed had plotted raids on nuke sites in the past.        
	But Prithviraj Chavan, minister of state in the PMO, told PTI tonight that all nuclear installations are very secure.

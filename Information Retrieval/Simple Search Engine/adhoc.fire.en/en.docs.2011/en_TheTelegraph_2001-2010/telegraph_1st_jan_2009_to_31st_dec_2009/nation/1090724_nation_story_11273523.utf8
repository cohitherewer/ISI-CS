          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Raipur, July 23: Thirty-five Congress legislators were suspended today for trooping into the well of the Chhattisgarh Assembly as a part of their protest against the government over the recent Maoist attacks.         
	The Opposition Congress has been agitating since the 10-day monsoon session started on Monday. In three sittings of the Assembly in the past four days, the Congress members did not allow the House to transact any business.         
	When the House assembled in the morning today, Congress members started raising slogans against the government, demanding the resignation of chief minister Raman Singh.         
	Members alleged that the governments failure resulted in the Madanwada Maoist attacks that killed superintendent of police Vinod Kumar Choubey and 35 personnel on July 12. The state Congress said that the chief minister should take moral responsibility for the incident and put in his papers immediately.         
	Amid the protest, 35 members stormed the House. In the House of 90, Congress has 38 members. Three were absent today. Suspended members include former chief minister Ajit Jogi and leader of Opposition Ravindra Choubey.         
	Under Section 250 of the rules of procedure and conduct of business in the Assembly, membership of those who enter the well is deemed suo moto suspended for such period as Speaker deems fit.         
	Though Speaker Dharamlal Kaushik suspended the Congress members for the day, he revoked it after 10 minutes and invited the Opposition for a debate on the issue. The Congress members, however, did not return and marched up to the Raj Bhavan instead.         
	A delegation of Congress legislators met Chhattisgarh Governor E.S.L. Narasimhan and submitted a four-page memorandum demanding imposition of Presidents rule in the state.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Kingmaker Lalu loses out
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Kingmaker Lalu loses out
          NALIN VERMA                          Lalu Prasad: Verdict punch                                  
	Patna, Dec. 23: Lalu Prasad, who emerged kingmaker by installing Madhu Koda in the Jharkhand hot seat in 2006, apparently lost his role in the post-poll scenario in the neighbouring state with his RJD winning only five seats.        
	If Shibu Soren  believed to have emerged a king than a kingmaker with the JMM bagging 18 seats  forms the government with support of the Congress-JVM(P) alliance, Lalu stands all the more isolated in Ranchi.        
	Even if the BJP, which with JD(U) has got 20 seats, goes for a government in alliance with the JMM, in that scenario, too, the RJD boss will have no role at all.        
	Lalu has also suffered a loss in the battle, which, in his words, none has won either.         
	While Lalu has nearly retained his strength by winning five against seven seats his party won in the last polls, his arch rival JD(U), which has been ruling Bihar, has been reduced to two from six in the plateau state. His main foe BJP with 18 seats is far away from forming its government.        
	Obviously, Lalu did not look too dismayed at the results. Tell me who has won. No party or alliance is even remotely close to the magic figure of 41. Still, I am happy that the secular parties together have won the seats, which are far more than majority to form the government. It is time for the secular parties to learn from what they have gained from fighting among themselves, he said.        
	Lalus indirect reference was towards the Congress, which is not in a position to dictate the terms in Jharkhand despite winning 25 seats in alliance with the JVM(P) of Babulal Marandi.         
	Though Lalu did not speak on the issue too much, the RJD strategists calculate that the Congress would find it hard to dictate terms despite freeing itself from Lalu.         
	The Congress, boasting of its revival in Jharkhand and Bihar, will have to play in the hands of Babulal and Shibu Soren. Despite their differences, Shibu with 18 seats and Babulal with 11 will not allow the Sonia Gandhi outfit to run Jharkhand according to its free will, said a senior RJD strategist.        
	The Congress is not in a position to pick up the chief minister of its choice. It is destined to play as an arbiter while suffocating in the pincer grip of two highly ambitious leaders, Babulal and Soren. We will always find it an uphill task to keep the two swords in the same cover, said a senior Congress leader.        
	On the other hand, Bihar deputy chief minister and senior BJP leader S.K. Modi said results of the Jharkhand Assembly polls would in no way affect the NDA in next years Bihar elections. There wont be any impact on the alliance between the BJP and JD(U) in Bihar... the two parties will continue their ties in the 2010 Assembly polls, Modi said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sonia picks alliance specialist Azad 
                                                                                                               Sonia picks alliance specialist Azad 
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                  Azad, Kidwai                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 19: Sonia Gandhi tonight inducted Ghulam Nabi Azad as a general secretary into her election team and put him in charge of four states  Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Orissa and Pondicherry.        
	The return of Azad is being seen as significant because he is an old organisational hand who, as a former general secretary, handled practically every crucial state and delivered unexpected victories and sewed up alliances.        
	In Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, which have been put under the charge of Azad, alliances play a crucial role and the outcome in these states is expected to play a significant role in deciding who will form the next government at the Centre.        
	In Karnataka, so far, the Janata Dal (Secular) has not been responsive to the Congresss overtures. But a section is convinced that unless the Congress teams up with H.D. Deve Gowda, the party will find it difficult to take on the BJP.         
	Azads first brief will be to try and reach out to Gowda and his son, H.D. Kumaraswamy. Prithviraj Chavan, who was minding Karnataka so far, failed to strike a rapport with the Gowdas.        
	Azad was also inducted into the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the partys highest decision-making body.        
	The other notable change was the re-induction of Margaret Alva, who lost her job as general secretary and her place in the CWC when she accused some of her colleagues of selling tickets in the Karnataka elections.        
	She has not been as lucky as Azad though  her rehabilitation is partial. Alva has been put on the election screening committees of Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland and Sikkim, which are chaired by Union minister Vayalar Ravi. Alva has not been included in the CWC.        
	Bengal was taken off Mohsina Kidwai and given to K. Keshava Rao, the former Andhra Pradesh Congress president. He was also made a permanent invitee to the CWC.        
	The induction of a leader not closely identified with Bengal politics could make negotiations with the Trinamul Congress easier.        
	Kidwai has been given the charge of Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Chandigarh and Lakshadweep.        
	Two former chief ministers, Vilasrao Deshmukh (Maharashtra) and Luizinho Faliero (Goa), were brought into the CWC as permanent invitees and farmed out organisational responsibilities. Deshmukh has been asked to head the Maharashtra poll campaign committee.        
	Keen not to ruffle feathers in various states, Sonia inducted Kerala and Karnataka veterans K. Karunakaran and Mallikarjuna Kharge into the CWC.        
	Apart from Chavan, who has managed to retain only Jammu and Kashmir from among the numerous states under his charge and has been given Haryana as a consolation prize, the other general secretary to lose a big state was V. Narayanaswamy. Madhya Pradesh was taken away from him and handed to B.K. Hari Prasad.        
	Rahul Gandhi continues to be in charge of the Youth Congress and the NSUI.

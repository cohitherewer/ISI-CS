          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 18: The Congresss reluctance to take major decisions during the inauspicious shradh period has prevented an AICC shuffle, forcing the party to fight the upcoming Assembly polls with part-time generals.        
	Although the shradh period ended today, party sources said an organisational overhaul could not be done in the middle of the electoral process.        
	So, A.K. Antony has to set aside time from his schedule as defence minister to handle knotty alliance issues with the Nationalist Congress Party and oversee election management in Maharashtra. But even he will not be as busy as his ministry colleague Prithviraj Chavan, who is in charge of Haryana.        
	Apart from his demanding job as a minister in the Prime Ministers Office, Chavan has independent charge of the science and technology ministry in addition to his duties in the ministries of earth sciences, personnel, public grievances and pensions, and parliamentary affairs.        
	V. Narayansamy, minister of state for planning and parliamentary affairs, is looking after the third state going to the polls: Arunachal Pradesh.        
	The practice of engaging ministers in party work, started during the first UPA governments tenure, has few supporters among senior leaders and even Sonia Gandhi wants to scrap it, sources say. All ministers will have to give up party work in the next shuffle.        
	The sources said Sonia was to have announced a major shuffle before the start of the shradh period but entrenched interests somehow delayed the process. The party has to pay the price now by keeping ministers engaged in election work.        
	Many politically important states other than the poll-bound ones, too, are in the hands of Union ministers. Ghulam Nabi Azad, who continues to be AICC general secretary despite becoming health minister, is in charge of Orissa, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.        
	While the BJP has snatched Karnataka from the Congress, Orissa has been out of bounds for the party for over a decade. Sources said Azad had requested Sonia to assign party work to full-time general secretaries.         
	Delhi, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Nagaland and Tripura have Union ministers Mukul Wasnik, V. Narayansamy and Veerappa Moily as minders. Even some of those given election management assignments  such as Vilasrao Deshmukh, Sushil Kumar Shinde and Anand Sharma  are Union ministers.        
	With the ministers almost certain to be relieved of their organisational responsibilities whenever the shuffle takes place, some others will benefit.

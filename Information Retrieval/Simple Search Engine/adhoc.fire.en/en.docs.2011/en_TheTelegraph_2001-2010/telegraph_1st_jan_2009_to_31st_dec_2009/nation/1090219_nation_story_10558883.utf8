                                                                                                               Lanka row
                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 18 (PTI): The Sri Lanka issue today rocked the Lok Sabha with two Tamil parties, including the UPA partner PMK, seeking Indias intervention to stop military offensive in the island nation, a demand that was virtually rejected by the government.        
	Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee made it clear that India could not force a sovereign government to take a particular line even as he denounced the LTTE, saying it had caused much damage to the Tamil community.        
	Asking the LTTE to lay down arms, he said there is a political opportunity after 23 years to restore normalcy in northern Sri Lanka and that India is ready to assist in its reconstruction and development.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Soren plays hard, tests Delhi
                                                                                                               Soren plays hard, tests Delhi
          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                              
	Ranchi, Jan. 10: Shibu Soren today said his party was ready to head a new government and he would resign only after fresh talks in Delhi, as the vanquished Jharkhand chief minister played for time after Thursdays embarrassing loss.        
	Ill be going to Delhi tomorrow to convey to UPA heavyweights my partys decision to form a new government, he said, and argued that he was not legally bound to step down immediately.        
	JMM sources said a consensus was evolving around Seraikela MLA Champai Soren  unrelated to the chief minister but considered his right-hand man  to head a new government, though Soren refused to name his successor.        
	I held a meeting with my partys central executive members and legislators, Soren, who returned from Delhi today, told reporters. We will form a new government. But I will not tell you who will be leading the new government though the name has been finalised.        
	Humbled in Tamar, Ranchi, in a bypoll he needed to win to stay on in power, Soren conceded that his exit was imminent but said he would step down at his own time.        
	I have been given a verdict by the peoples court which is the supreme authority in a democracy. But before doing anything, I need to work out viable alternatives as well, he said. Agreed, the chief minister has been defeated, which is a very big thing, but the day is not yet over.        
	Sources said at todays meeting of the JMM executive committee, Soren insisted that his wife Rupi or one of his sons be named chief minister if the UPA wanted to avoid fresh elections. But as none of them was an MLA, Champai came into the picture.        
	Soren, the sources said, is comfortable with Champai as he played an active role in ousting Madhu Koda, one of the several chief ministers Jharkhand has seen in the last eight years.        
	Koda, the UPA state chief, said central alliance leaders had asked Soren to resign immediately. He should quit because he is morally bound to, Koda, who is being backed by RJD boss Lalu Prasad, added.        
	Babulal Marandi, another former chief minister, said he would leave no stone unturned to foil Sorens nefarious designs.        
	Several RJD and Congress leaders are likely to leave for Delhi tomorrow.

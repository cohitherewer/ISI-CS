          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 31: The CPMs effort to pacify V.S. Achuthanandan continues, so does the Kerala chief ministers reluctance to accept the party line that the corruption case against his rival Pinarayi Vijayan needs to be fought politically.        
	As Achuthanandan keeps up his silence, giving anxious moments to the central leadership over whether he will bring matters to an ugly head, the divide is embarrassing the party.         
	A day before the CPM general secretary Prakash Karat and politburo colleagues Sitaram Yechury, S Ramachandran Pillai and K. Varadharajan address a rally in Kerala, ally CPI evaluated that the issue has dented the image of the Left government.         
	The CPIs state secretariat in Kerala, which was attended by general secretary A.B. Bardhan, had leaders expressing doubts about the success of a strategy to paint the CBI as villain in a corruption case.         
	Left leaders are known for their constant fight against corruption, and here we have the situation of a leader being defended, and moreover the matter being handled in a very inept manner, a state CPI leader said. The matter has brought an image blow to the ruling LDF, especially the way it was handled, the leader added.         
	However, the CPI decided it would not publicly comment on the issue which now is an internal matter of the CPM.        
	Vijayan, a CPM politburo member and the Kerala state unit chief, has been named in a corruption case over the award of contracts for modernisation of three hydel power plants when he was power minister.         
	The CPM claims the case is politically motivated, but Achuthanandan wants Vijayan benched till the probe is cleared.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Copenhagen - Day 9
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Copenhagen - Day 9

	Spewing summit        
	The Copenhagen summit will generate more carbon emissions than any previous climate conference, equivalent to the annual output by 2,300 Americans or 660,000 Ethiopians. Delegates, journalists, activists and observers from almost 200 countries have gathered at the December 7-18 summit and their travel and work will create 46,200 tonnes of CO2, most of it from their flights to Copenhagen.        
	This would fill nearly 10,000 Olympic swimming pools. The calculation includes emissions caused by accommodation, local transport, electricity and heating of the conference centre, paper, security, transport of goods and services as well as energy used by computers, kitchens, photocopiers and printers at the conference centre. About 18,000 people are expected to pass through the conference centre every day        
	Lucky duo        
	Two ex-Soviet industrial powerhouses find themselves heirs to an unlikely windfall. Russia and Ukraine head into the summit with credits for billions of tonnes of CO2 they no longer belch, thanks to the collapse of the Soviet industrial machine that gave them favourable terms under the Kyoto Protocol. They can pollute more and also sell carbon credits to other countries for millions of dollars        
	China list        
	Differing from the African nations, a senior Chinese envoy said the developing nations top concern was to secure funds from the rich to pay for carbon emission cuts and cover the cost of adapting to a warmer world. The most pressing issues are: firstly finance, secondly emission reduction targets, third technology transfer, He Yafei said                        Canadian author Naomi Klein  announces the Angry Mermaid award in Copenhagen, given to the company that has done the most to sabotage action against climate change. Monsanto received 37 per cent votes, Royal Dutch Shell 18 per cent and the American Petroleum Institute 14 per cent. (AFP)      
	Money pledge        
	A key ingredient for any climate deal will be a money pledge by rich countries to help poor ones fight global warming. The EU has promised around $3.5 billion a year for three years. The US will contribute about $1.2 billion this year. The US has also unveiled a $350m multinational effort to help provide clean energy technology to developing countries, including India, to curb emissions        
	India claim        
	Despite being the fourth-largest economy, Indias per capita emission levels are 70 per cent below the world average and 93 per cent lower than those in the US, says a joint report by business chamber Assocham and consultancy firm Ernest and Young. It highlights that carbon emissions in India increased by 65 per cent since 1990        
	Canada hoax        
	Canada has condemned a series of hoax emails and a fake website story that claimed the country would cut emissions by a much greater amount than previously announced. Officials said they believed environmental activists were responsible for the hoax. Canada is under fire from green campaigners, who say its pledge to cut emissions by 20 per cent from 2006 levels by 2020, is grossly inadequate.        
	The emails said Canada would set binding emission reduction targets of 40 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020 and at least 80 per cent by 2050                    AGENCIES

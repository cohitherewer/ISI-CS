The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pak diplomat tortured, killed
                                                                                                               Pak diplomat tortured, killed
          NASIR JAFFRY AND AGENCIES                          Niaz A Naik                                  
	Islamabad, Aug. 8: Former Pakistan foreign secretary Niaz A. Naik, who was involved in back-channel diplomacy with India during the 1999 Kargil crisis, was tortured and murdered at his home here, police said today.        
	The unmarried Naik, 70, who lived alone, was apparently killed 4-5 days ago and his decomposed body was found at his home today after neighbours complained of a stench.        
	The revelation that he was murdered marked a turnaround from a police spokesmans earlier statement that there were no injury marks on the former diplomats body.        
	A post-mortem has revealed that Naik was tortured before being killed, said police officers and doctors who performed the autopsy.        
	He had been hit with a sharp and heavy object and there were signs of torture on his neck, the autopsy report said. Four ribs and the jaw were fractured and the lungs were damaged.        
	His body was completely decomposed and four of his ribs on the right side were found fractured, said Dr Waseem Khwaja, spokesman for the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences where the body had been taken.        
	He said that the fractured ribs also damaged Naiks lungs, adding that tests were being done to find out if his liver contained any traces of poison.        
	Officers said they were trying to ascertain the motive behind the murder.        
	Naik, a former high commissioner to India, often claimed that Pakistan and India had been ready to sign an agreement on Kashmir before the Kargil tensions ended the chances of a pact.        
	He is known to have had a role  in concert with then Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees aide R.K. Mishra  in setting the stage for Vajpayees bus ride to Lahore and the subsequent Lahore Declaration signed by the two countries.        
	Naik, though, was known as a hawk during his tenure as foreign secretary between 1986 and 1988. Diplomatic sources here said Naik had participated in Indo-Pak Track II diplomacy twice, first during the Kargil conflict and again in early 2002, when secret talks took place between retired army generals and diplomats from the two countries. Naik had wide experience in UN affairs and Pak-US relations.

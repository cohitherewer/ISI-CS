The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rivals join hands to stall security slash 
                                                                                                               Rivals join hands to stall security slash 
          OUR BUREAU                                     (From top) Mulayam, Mayavati, Lalu Prasad				                                 
	New Delhi, July 23: The Centre has shelved a move to reduce security for some politicians, pushed on the back foot by bitter political rivals who closed ranks to protect a symbol of Indias VIP culture.        
	Parliament was in uproar today over home minister P. Chidambarams alleged plan to prune the security of Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati, Samajwadi Party president Mulayam Singh Yadav, former railway minister and Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad and BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi.        
	After Mulayam and Lalu Prasad protested in the Lok Sabha yesterday, the Samajwadis today joined hands with Uttar Pradesh rival Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) to lambast the government in both Houses.        
	The home ministry had recently reviewed the threat perception for VIPs and apparently concluded that some of them could do without protection by the elite anti-terror commandos from the National Security Guard (NSG).        
	Officials said the NSG had recently written to the home ministry requesting permission to withdraw all its 3,000 personnel who are on VIP duty.        
	Ministry sources said the NSG  which has opened five new hubs after the Mumbai attacks and is mandated to be ever-ready to respond to a terror strike anywhere in the country  has been chronically short-staffed because its commandos are being constantly pulled out on VIP duty.        
	Even the state police forces are severely handicapped, with many of their best men assigned to protect politicians and other dignitaries, the sources said. Despite knowing all this, the Centre had to bow before the raucous MPs in Parliament today.        
	Soon after question hour began in the Rajya Sabha, BSP and Samajwadi members raised slogans and BSP members gathered in the well. Vice-President Hamid Ansari, Chairman of the House, adjourned proceedings.        
	BSP leader Satish Chandra Mishra appealed to the Prime Minister in the House to revoke the alleged home ministry decision. Sources said Manmohan Singh later asked Chidambaram about it.        
	At noon, parliamentary affairs minister Prithviraj Chavan announced: The government is deeply concerned about the security of all political leaders. I assure the House that the security provided to the leaders of the political parties mentioned in the notice will not be reduced.        
	Even then, Mishra insisted that the names be made public. After more uproar and another adjournment, Deputy Chairman K. Rehman Khan announced the names.        
	The notice, submitted by the aggrieved MPs, had the names of Mayavati, Mulayam, Lalu Prasad and Joshi. Chavans wording leaves open the possibility of reducing some other VIPs security, though.        
	In the Lok Sabha too, BSP and Samajwadi MPs had jointly raised an uproar, forcing four adjournments. After Chavans clarification, the two parties were back sparring with each other.

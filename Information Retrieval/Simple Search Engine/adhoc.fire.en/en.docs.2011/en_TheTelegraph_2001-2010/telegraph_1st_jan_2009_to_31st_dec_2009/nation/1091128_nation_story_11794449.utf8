          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 27: New Delhi is watching with concern a spurt in military exchanges between China and Pakistan but expects Beijing to respond to initiatives for a durable peace.        
	The increasing nexus between China and Pakistan in the military sphere remains an area of serious concern. We have to carry out continuous appraisals of Chinese military capabilities and shape our responses accordingly. At the same time, we need to be vigilant at all times, defence minister A.K. Antony said here today.        
	Antony was speaking at the 44th foundation day function of the Institute of Defence Studies and Analysis (IDSA), the ministrys think tank.         
	The defence ministers concern over the China-Pakistan military nexus was voiced even as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was understood to have told US President Barack Obama in Washington earlier this week that Pakistan was misusing American military aid.        
	China has committed to Pakistan that it will supply J-10 and JF-17 fighter aircraft. It has helped develop the port at Gwadar, near Karachi, and is building a highway across the Karakoram. Indian scientists have also alleged that China and North Korea have encouraged Pakistans missile development programme.        
	India wants to develop a friendly and cordial relationship with its neighbours, including China. We continue our efforts. At the same time, there are issues that are a matter of concern to us, he said.        
	Criticising Pakistan for not doing enough to curb terrorism emanating from its soil, Antony said the nation had allowed them to prosper and shown no resolve to act against terrorists.

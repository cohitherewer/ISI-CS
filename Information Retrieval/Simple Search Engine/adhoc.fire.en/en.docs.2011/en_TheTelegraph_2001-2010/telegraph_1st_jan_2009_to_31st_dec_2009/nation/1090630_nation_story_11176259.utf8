          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, June 29: P. Chidambaram today hit out at Mayavati for spending crores to build her own statues, signalling an intensification of the battle for Dalit votes between the Congress and the Bahujan Samaj Party.        
	Can there be something more shameful than this in Indian politics? the Union home minister said on a day the Supreme Court served a notice to Mayavatis government for spending public money to install the statues.        
	The Rs 1,000 crore could have helped wipe out the poverty of thousands of people and provided basic amenities and education, agencies quoted Chidambaram as saying in his Sivaganga constituency in Tamil Nadu.        
	Congress and BSP sources said the ministers attack showed the two parties tussle for Dalit votes countrywide had grown far more serious than it seemed.        
	If Mayavati is looking for openings in the south and west by exploiting chinks in the Congresss caste armour, the Congress believes its good showing in Uttar Pradesh in the Lok Sabha polls has given it an opportunity to cut into the BSPs Dalit votes.        
	In UP, the Congress has not passed up a single chance to work on Dalit voters. Once Meira Kumar was appointed Lok Sabha Speaker, the state unit plastered Dalit-majority areas with her posters.        
	Meira, who like Mayavati is a Jatav, is from Bihar but had defeated the BSP chief in a Lok Sabha by-election from Bijnore, UP, in 1985. The Congress believes that Meira can become an effective counter against Mayavati. The chief minister has been quick to take note of this and react.        
	On Sunday, she spelt out her stand on Meira in a booklet titled, Think, why a Dalits daughter could not become the Prime Minister.        
	The booklet accused the Congress and the BJP of misleading Dalits and alienating them from the BSP by making token appointments from the community to top constitutional posts.        
	Meira Kumar has been made Speaker to keep her away from her own people. In our country, the posts of President, Vice-President, governor and Speaker are such that the people of the Dalit community occupying them can do no good to the people of their own community, the booklet said.        
	It alleged that Dalits who took up such influential positions were mostly the selfish sort, who have nothing to do with the welfare of their community.

          LALMOHAN PATNAIK                              
	Cuttack, Feb. 6: A 25-year-old woman was reunited with her 10-month-old son after her in-laws took away the infant and drove her out of their house.         
	The family was trying to teach her a lesson after she failed to fulfil their dowry demands. The baby was born on November 2007 to Keonjhar-based Purna Chandra Dass daughter Ambika and Hemanta, the son of Baripada-based Sidheswar Das. The baby was separated from his mother soon after.         
	When Ambikas father finally brought her home on March 2008, the barely four-month-old baby Ritesh was not allowed to be taken back.         
	A fight began over the baby that reached Orissa High Court when Swayamshree, a Cuttack NGO lodged a dowry and torture case and sought judicial redress.        
	Initially, a habeas corpus writ was filed and the high court ordered for personal appearance by her husband with the child. Hemanta Das turned up in court with Ritesh on February 3.         
	After hearing the case Justice I.M. Qudussi ordered for immediate transfer of the infant to her mother, Ambikas counsel Sanjukta Patra told The Telegraph today.

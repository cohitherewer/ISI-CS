	Chicago, Dec. 11 (PTI): IIT alumnus Vikram Buddhi, who was in jail for posting hate messages in 2006 to then US President George W. Bush, has been sentenced to 57 months in prison and three years of supervised release.                          
	Buddhi, who was arrested in 2006, was sentenced by senior Judge James T Moody after being convicted of making threats to Bush, the then Vice President Dick Cheney and their wives, and calling for bombings of US infrastructure.        
	The 38-year old Phd student of Purdue University, will have to spend an additional three years under supervised release under the supervision of a probation officer, the court said.        
	He can though appeal the sentence in a Chicago court within 10 days of this judgement. Since he has already been in prison since April 2006, the months are likely to be deducted from his sentence term.        
	Buddhi, who represented himself during the sentence hearing after firing his lawyer, said earlier that he was given the short end of the stick, and claimed the trial had been unfair.        
	Before the sentencing Buddhi submitted to the judge that he had got ineffective assistance of the counsel and said it was the gravest error of justice.        
	Buddhi had yesterday fired his lawyer Arlington Foley for not discussing the case properly, and said would involuntarily represent himself at the hearing.

	New Delhi, April 17: A five-year-old was allegedly raped, left to bleed to death and her body dumped in a water tank on a neighbours terrace, police said today.        
	Little Gaipuiliu Gangmei had come from Nagaland only two months back to join her mother Aluna, working as a nurse in Delhi.        
	Doctors at Vasant Kunjs Indian Spinal Injuries Centre, where Aluna works, said Gaipuiliu had bled to death after the alleged rape. Marks of strangulation and bruises were also found.         
	Police said investigations were on but no arrests had been made.        
	Gaipuiliu had been left with her grandmother at their home in Mahipalpur, a middle-class neighbourhood in south-west Delhi, when Aluna went for duty at the hospital. Aluna got a call this afternoon from her mother saying the child could not be found anywhere.         
	She rushed back home and began searching for her daughter on the terrace, where Gaipuiliu had apparently gone to dry clothes.         
	According to a member of the Naga Students Union of Delhi, which is helping the family, Aluna looked around and spotted her daughters naked body floating in the water tank of a neighbour.         
	The mother cant even talk. The child had been living with her relatives in Jalukie town in Nagaland before she came to Delhi, Mgonmei, the union member, said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, July 26: A sub-inspector of Orissa police is in jail after a tribal girl charged him of rape, an official said today.         
	The accused, Ghanashyam Hesa, of Kalinganagar police station, on July 15 reportedly drove the victim to his residence after she got down from a bus at Duburi while returning to Khurusia, her village, from Bhubaneswar. The policeman told her that her parents were waiting for her at his rented home in the Kalinganagar Industrial Complex area.         
	Nobody was there when we reached. He raped me, said the 18-year-old in her statement to the police yesterday.         
	Shortly afterwards we arrested the sub-inspector, said Jajpur superintendent D.S. Kuttey. Deputy superintendent of police B.B. Mallick is probing into the charges which fall under Sections 376 and 506 of the IPC.         
	The accused was sent to jail after the court rejected his bail plea and forwarded him to judicial custody.         
	Meanwhile, preliminary investigations have revealed that after the alleged incident on July 15, the SIs father had met the victims family and sought her hand for marriage with his son. The victims father had given his consent and the marriage was fixed on July 26.         
	The SI had threatened to kill me if I opened my mouth. I know he was powerful, said the victims father, Dabor Jamuda, a wage labourer who works at the chromite mines in Kaliapani.         
	The SI who was suspended was examined today, while the victim was medically examined earlier on Thursday.

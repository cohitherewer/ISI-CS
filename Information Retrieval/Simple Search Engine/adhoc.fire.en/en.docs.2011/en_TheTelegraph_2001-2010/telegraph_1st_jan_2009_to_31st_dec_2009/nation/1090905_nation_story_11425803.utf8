The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | A Lone but no quitter 
                                                                                                               A Lone but no quitter 
  - separatist poster boy once, sajjad learns from defeat          MUZAFFAR RAINA                          Sajjad Lone with son Emad                                        
	Srinagar, Sept. 4: Defeated poll candidates are supposed to go into hiding, resurfacing only when they have found an issue to rabble-rouse.        
	But Sajjad Lone is an unusual politician  he is ready to talk about his election defeat, how it shattered him and even made him think of quitting politics, and how he came out of the depression.        
	Even more unusually, he acknowledges that failure he came a poor third  has taught him lessons that success might not have. It was a very public defeat. I hogged all the limelight (after announcing his participation in polls) and then I lost. I was depressed, went into a shell, didnt talk and issued no statement, Sajjad, 43, told The Telegraph in his first interview after May 16, the day he lost to a National Conference candidate.        
	The stakes had been very high. Sajjad the poster boy of Kashmirs separatist politics during last years Amarnath land agitation, had parted ways with the separatists to plunge into electoral politics.        
	A few days after the defeat, a confused Sajjad left on a 45-day trip alone to cities like Delhi and Mumbai to come to terms with the situation. For some days it was bad there as well, but things soon became normal, the Cardiff-educated politician said.        
	After three months, he has detected a silver lining, or so he says. I was on the verge of quitting politics but thank God I didnt. It would have been a most stupid thing to do, a knee-jerk reaction. I have realised how important a setback in life is, how boring it becomes without it. I still dread defeat but without it you never evolve, he said.        
	As he prepares for a fresh innings, he is lucky to have with him his wife Asma and twin boys Emad and Adnan, who returned recently from Pakistan after an 18-month separation. Asma is a Pakistani. In January last year, she had gone across with her two sons, who will be five in November.        
	My two sons are Indian citizens but they were entered on their mothers passport. For all these months they (New Delhi officials) sat on the file. Only last month she (Asma) was called up and asked to collect the passports, Sajjad said.        
	He doesnt know why the visas were denied then and granted now, or so he claims. But the buzz in party circles is that New Delhi tightened the noose around him after he authored the 2007 document Achievable Nationhood, a road map for the creation of two semi-independent entities in two parts of Kashmir  a document he still swears by.        
	The return of his family, he says, has given a life to his home. My kids did recognise me because I had been to Pakistan twice during this period to meet them. But they didnt recognise my mother, who saw them after two years. They vandalised my bedroom, pounced and damaged the showers, but I am enjoying all this, he said.        
	Sajjad, who calls himself a Kashmiri nationalist, has a daunting task at hand.        
	When they (the children) came here they were proud Pakistanis but within a few days, their Kashmiri lineage has taken over. They dont speak Kashmiri yet but I will work hard to make them comfortable with it in a few months, said the younger son of slain separatist leader Abdul Ghani Lone, who was killed by militants for his moderate views.        
	But the more daunting task would be to make himself relevant again, particularly after burning his bridges with the separatists including elder brother Bilal, with whom he is not even on talking terms.        
	I no longer need a certificate from India, Pakistan or the separatists. My participation in elections proved that I represented a certain section of people, however small it is, Sajjad attributes his defeat largely to lack of preparedness, said.        
	Now he has ample time to make preparations for the next elections. Your (politicians) biggest folly is when you distance yourself from the day-to-day problems of people, because it kills your cause. I will keep fighting for them and again prove myself.

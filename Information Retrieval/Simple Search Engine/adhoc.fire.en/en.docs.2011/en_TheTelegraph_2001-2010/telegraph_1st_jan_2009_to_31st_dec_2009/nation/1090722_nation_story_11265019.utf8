          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, July 21: With hours left for the centurys longest solar eclipse, the Pathani Samanta Planetarium here is brimming with children and grown ups all ready for the event.        
	Visitors could be seen quizzing staff on arrangements made for the event that would be partial in the state.        
	We have a telescope in our school and all of us will be allowed to see the eclipse through it. Some of us purchased solar glasses to see the sun, said Satrupa Jena, a Class V student.        
	However, weathermen predict that the partly cloudy sky and the possibility of rain and thunderstorm tomorrow may spoil the day for many.         
	The eclipse is expected to start from 5:28am and continue till 7:27am tomorrow.         
	While a section chooses to cheer the event, a portion of the population will be fasting and praying to ward off evil spirits during this event.         
	We will not eat this evening and will continue fasting till the eclipse is over, said Bijayalaxmi Mandal, a homemaker.         
	We have four telescopes, two binoculars, one miler film and 14 welding glasses for the people who are interested in the event, said the planetarium director.

	Raipur, May 15: Maoist guerrillas sprayed bullets on a police chopper that was bringing in ailing security personnel from the interiors of Bastar in Dantewada today morning.         
	Alert pilots successfully navigated the chopper away from the hail of bullets, but a jawan deployed in the temporary helipad was killed in the firing, while another was critically wounded. A private chopper hired by state for the anti-Maoist operation landed in the temporary helipad of Kisteram in Dantewada around 9am to bring in the ailing personnel. A large number of security personnel were deployed in the helipad as part of security drill.         
	Kisteram is located on the Chhattisgarh-Andhra Pradesh borders and its terrain makes it a haven for rebels. Even ration for the personnel is transported via a chopper in the area.        
	According to sub-divisional police officer Ravi Kurre the rebels had taken position near the helipad that was covered with forests. As the chopper took off rebels started firing.         
	Pilots, however, flew off from the terror zone despite two bullets hitting the body. Sources said one hit the blade that was badly damaged. The pilots flew the chopper in the same condition and made a safe landing in Jagdalpurabout some 400km away.         
	Till the filing of this report in the evening, the body of the jawan and the injured security personal could not be brought to the district headquarters. Kurre said additional force had been sent to the spot to bring the injured jawan and the body of policeman.

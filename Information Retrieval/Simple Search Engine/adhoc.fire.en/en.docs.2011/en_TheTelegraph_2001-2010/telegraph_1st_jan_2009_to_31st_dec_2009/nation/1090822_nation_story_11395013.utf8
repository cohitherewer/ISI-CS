          ANANYA SENGUPTA                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 21: A young man who allegedly kidnapped his seven-year-old niece was arrested today after raising suspicion by volunteering to deliver the ransom.        
	Police said film buff Vikas Sethi, 23, had confessed he had got the idea after watching Prakash Jhas Apaharan a few days ago, but his botched, contradiction-riddled plan had few similarities with the crime movies plot.        
	Vikass blunders began from the moment he kidnapped Class II student Akshita on Wednesday, the police said. His ransom call to his aunt Neesha Madan, Akshitas mother and a professional nurse, laid down a strict condition.        
	The complainant (Neesha) told us the kidnappers had told her the ransom should not be delivered by any relative or close friend of the complainant, said H.G.S. Dhaliwal, deputy commissioner of police, south. We got suspicious that some close relative might be involved in the kidnapping.        
	On Thursday, Vikas drew suspicion on himself by suddenly appearing at his aunts home. He claimed the kidnappers had asked him to deliver the ransom amount  even though he was a relative.        
	Vikas came to the house and told the complainant he was accosted by two men on his way to her house. They apparently told him to get the ransom money arranged immediately, otherwise the girl would be killed, Dhaliwal said.        
	We got suspicious as to how the kidnappers knew that the girl was known to Vikas. Enquiries revealed that Vikas was heavily into debt. On sustained interrogation, Vikas broke down and revealed he had kidnapped the girl with help from an accomplice.        
	Neesha, a divorcee with three children, said Akshita had gone out for her coaching classes and failed to return. Then the ransom caller warned her that if she failed to pay up or informed the police, her daughter would be killed. Neesha immediately informed the police.        
	Investigations revealed the call had come from Vishwas Nagar in Shahdara, south Delhi  where Neeshas sister (Vikass mother) lives.        
	Vikas, who had studied till Class XII, had begun a mobile repair business and lost a lot of money. His accomplice in the kidnapping was Shahid Anwar, a barber who procured the SIM card with which the ransom call was made, the police said. Akshita was found at Anwars salon.        
	Apaharan, a film made in 2005 starring Ajay Devgan, portrayed Bihars booming kidnapping industry during Lalu Prasads rule.

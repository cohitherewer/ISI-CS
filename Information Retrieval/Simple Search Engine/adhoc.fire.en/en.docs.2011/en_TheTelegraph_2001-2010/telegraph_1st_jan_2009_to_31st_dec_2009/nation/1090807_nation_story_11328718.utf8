          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, Aug. 6: About 100 students and their parents today locked the gates of a government school, marched 30km to the house of the local MLA and deposited the key. Their demand? A teacher.        
	Students of the government school in Mandlaur village of Abhanpur development block in Raipur district, irked over not having a teacher for a year, expressed their anger in this manner today.         
	After a meeting, about 100 students of the middle school, along with their parents, locked the gate of the school in the morning and walked about 30km to the state capital with the key.         
	They first went to the residence of state agriculture minister Chandrashekhar Sahu.         
	In his absence, they handed over a memorandum to the security guard and marched to the residence of education minister Brijmohan Agrawal  about 100m away. They handed over the key to Agrawal and urged him to send it  along with a teacher  to open the school if the state was really interested in providing education.         
	The school does not have a single teacher for a year and despite bringing the matter to the notice of the local legislator, education minister and department secretary, no action was taken, village sarpanch (chief) Goverdhan said. Agrawal assured the students that the department would appoint a teacher within a week.         
	The department is working on a proposal and within three months, not a single school will be left in the state without a teacher, Agrawal said.

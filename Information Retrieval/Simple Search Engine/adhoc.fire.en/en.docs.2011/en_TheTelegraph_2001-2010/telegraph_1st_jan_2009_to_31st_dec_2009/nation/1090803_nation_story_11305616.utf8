	Patna, Aug. 2: Recommendations of the D. Bandhopadhyay Commission to implement an act protecting the rights of bargadars (sharecroppers) have created ripples in the hinterland with landowners opposing the move.         
	Bandhopadhyay, an architect of the legislation to protect the rights of bargadars in neighbouring Bengal, recommended that the Nitish Kumar government to bring about a legislation protecting sharecroppers and fixing a ceiling of 15 acres (agricultural or non-agricultural land) besides updating and computerising land records.         
	Gauging the sensitivity of the issue, the government did not table the report in the Assembly that concluded on Friday. But, it circulated the copies (in CDs) of the report to legislators to form an opinion.         
	A section of legislators, claiming to have been representing the poor and land-less sections raised a hue and cry in the House on Friday demanding the state table the report.         
	But, the chief minister clarified that the state had constituted the Bandhopadhyay Commission to seek suggestions that could be handy in resorting to land reforms in the state. The government, Nitish said: Was under no compulsion to implement what Bandopadhyay recommended. The state, he said, had constituted a committee to study the recommendations.         
	BJP legislators supporting the government did not join the ruckus raised by the Opposition. But, a section of them felt that Bandhopadyays recommendations should be put in cold storage, as it would pit landowners against bargadars, triggering agrarian unrest.         
	They were of the opinion that even the bargadari system introduced in Bengal in 1977 had hardly played any role in augmenting the agriculture produce and mitigating rural poverty.         
	Experts on the agrarian matters believe that a vast majority of even the backward castes, which were land-less in Sixties and Seventies, have turned out to be landed gentry, wielding strong influence on almost all the parties operating in the state.         
	In such a situation, experts feel, Nitish Kumar might not receive the support of a large section of his party and alliance partner if he goes implementing the Bandhopadhyay Commissions recommendations in totality.         
	The commission has recommended for the share-croppers hereditary right over the lands they have been cropping in share. It means that the landowner can not take his land back from the sharecroppers sons and daughters unless the latter refused to carry out the farming on the land.        
	Besides, the commission has recommended that bargadars might get loan on their landowners land.         
	It has also recommended that the sharecropper will be entitled to 75 per cent of the produce if he did not share the investment with the landlords.        
	And in case, the landlord sharing the investment of farming, the sharecropper will be entitled to 60 per cent of the produce.         
	Despite Nitish Kumar facing a strong possibility of opposition from within his party and alliance, Bandhopadhyay believes that the Bihar government should implement his recommendations as it would revolutionise the farm sector in the state and ensure land to land-less.

  - False case against J amp;K duo           ANANYA SENGUPTA                                    
	New Delhi, Nov. 13: A Delhi court today slammed the states anti-terror cell for making an absolutely false, fabricated and manipulated case against two Kashmiri youths who were accused of being Lashkar-e-Toiba operatives planning attacks in the capital.         
	While acquitting Gulzar Ahmed Ganai and Mohammad Amin Hazam, the judge said: The case of the prosecution is absolutely false, fabricated and manipulated. The entire story is cooked up and the evidence has been created and the accused has been falsely implicated. The entire prosecution evidence is inconclusive and does not point towards the guilt of the accused, rather proves their innocence.         
	The embarrassment was perhaps greater because the youths were arrested by a team under inspector M.C. Sharma, who was killed in the Batla House encounter on September 19 last year.        
	The cell, Delhi polices anti-terror squad, had claimed that the duo had come to plot attacks ahead of the Republic Day in 2006.        
	The special cell presented witnesses saying they had seen the two get off a bus at a spot in the capital where the vehicle had actually never gone. In fact, it did not run on the route at the time the witnesses claimed to have seen them.        
	The Telegraph had reported on August 10 that the cell has failed to secure a single conviction from among the 29 terrorists who were picked up in the run-up to Independence Day and Republic Day celebrations since January 2000.         
	Today, Gulzar from Srinagar and Mohammad from Baramulla were added to the list of such suspects.         
	Gulzar and Mohammad were shown to be arrested on December 10, 2006, almost two weeks after being picked up on November 26 and illegally detained.        
	The witnesses said the two were held after they got off a bus that had reached Mahipalpur in west Delhi at 9.15pm from Dhaula Kuan. The police said 1.5kg of RDX, two detonators and Rs 6 lakh were seized from them. The police also said that they even had tickets to prove the two were travelling by the particular bus at that time.        
	However, the bus conductor and the owner said the vehicle hadnt run on that route at that time because there were not enough passengers. In fact, the bus had not made any trip after 5.55pm on November 26.         
	The cell was embarrassed further when the owner-conductor duo said the bus usually reached Mahipalpur only around 10.15pm.        
	The court said: It has been proved that the story of the prosecution is fabricated and manipulated.        
	Ganai was a second year BA student and Amin an assistant in the Jammu and Kashmir governments revenue department.

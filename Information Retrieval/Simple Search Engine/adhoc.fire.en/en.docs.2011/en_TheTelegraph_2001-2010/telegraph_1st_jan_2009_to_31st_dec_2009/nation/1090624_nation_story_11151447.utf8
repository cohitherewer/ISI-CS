	Ranchi/Jamshedpur, June 23: Maoists protesting the Lalgarh operation today blew up portions of a panchayat office in Jharkhand, prompting Ranchi to call for additional central forces with special powers for hot pursuit into Bengal if necessary.        
	The attack at Saraidih in the western Palamau district came on the second and final day of a CPI (Maoist)-sponsored bandh, called in five Naxalite-hit states in opposition to the police offensive in Lalgarh.        
	Yesterday, the rebels had exploded a landmine under a mine-protected police vehicle in Chakulia, just 8km from the Bengal border, but no one was killed.        
	The panchayat office was abandoned, so no one was injured. Two successive blasts were triggered around 1am, a police spokesman said, adding that villagers heard slogans of Maoist zindabad soon after the deafening explosions.        
	The attacks coincide with intelligence reports of Maoist influx from Lalgarh into Jharkhand.        
	State police chief V.D. Ram has sent an SOS to the Centre, seeking four additional companies of the CRPF to be deployed as a special frontier force. Jharkhand now has 30 CRPF companies.        
	At present, security personnel on border duty in Jharkhand need permission to cross over to Bengal, but Ram said the special force, if commissioned, would have free access to both sides of the border.        
	Intelligence reports say that Maoists from West Midnapore have infiltrated into Ghatshila, Chakulia and Dhalbhumgarh in Jharkhand and, following the Lalgarh operation, are trying to flex their muscle in these areas. The reports also suggest that the Maoists intend to make Chakulia the epicentre of terror attacks in Jharkhand.        
	Chakulia is where infiltration efforts by activists of an alleged Maoist front from Bengal were thwarted on June 5.        
	East Singhbhum superintendent of police Naveen Kumar Singh said feedback from villagers in Chakulia, during a combing operation that followed the landmine blast, suggested heavy rebel influx in the region.        
	We need to take concrete measures to flush out the Maoists, Singh said, adding that local help was taken to plant the landmine yesterday.

	Guwahati, June 25: Bhut jolokia, the hottest chilli in the world, could become the armys latest weapon with multiple uses.        
	They can be used in non-lethal hand grenades, as a food supplement or to drive away elephants.         
	The Defence Research amp; Development Organisation (DRDO) is working on the various uses of bhut jolokia.        
	Used as a food supplement, the worlds hottest chilli could help soldiers weather the high-altitude chill.         
	The chilli could work miracles for soldiers on the icy heights by way of raising body temperature, R.B. Srivastava, the Delhi-based director (life science) of the DRDO, said.         
	He said the chilli may permanently be included in the diet of the armed forces deputed at high altitudes.         
	The Gwalior-based laboratory of the DRDO is also working on a project to make hand grenades, which would act as an alternative to teargas, with bhut jolokia, he added.         
	The Defence Research Laboratory under the DRDO in Gwalior is working on this project, he added.        
	We are also working on a project to use bhut jolokia to keep away elephants from our defence establishments in the Northeast, Srivastava said, adding that the idea was given to the Defence Research Laboratory (DRL) by the Worldwide Funds for Animals (WWF).         
	Elephants have become a threat to many army bases located near reserve forests and wildlife sanctuaries. Since the smell of Naga chilli keeps them away, a chilli paste coated on a rope on the boundary could be a solution to this problem, he said.        
	Bhut jolokias hotness quotient  1,001,304 heat units on the Scoville scale  makes it twice as fiery as the Red Savina, a Mexican variety that previously held the world record.

                                                                                                               Morcha fast called off
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Darjeeling, Jan. 7: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha this evening decided to withdraw its hunger strikes in front of police stations across the hills even as most government offices remained shut as part of the non-cooperation movement that resumed today.         
	Morcha general secretary Roshan Giri said: We decided to lift the relay hunger strike to concentrate on our party activities, scheduled to start in the Dooars soon.         
	There were no Morcha picketers in town, but state and central government offices were vacant.         
	No untoward incident was reported. Those in the election office attended work (for revision of electoral rolls). A meeting to discuss culling operations in Pubong was also held, said Surendra Gupta, Darjeeling district magistrate.        
	Culling was expected to start at 4.30pm following the confirmation of the outbreak of bird flu in Pubong village, 45km from Darjeeling.

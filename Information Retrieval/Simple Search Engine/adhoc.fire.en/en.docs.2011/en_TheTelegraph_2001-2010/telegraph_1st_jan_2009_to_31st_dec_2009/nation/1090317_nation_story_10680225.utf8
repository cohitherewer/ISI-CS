The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Friend in, ministry in dark
                                                                                                               Friend in, ministry in dark
  - Arjun panel that chose CBSE chief had no education official        CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                     
	New Delhi, March 16: Arjun Singh kept his own ministry in the dark over the selection process for the top job at Indias largest school board, allowing him to recommend a friend.        
	Not even the secretary in charge of school education in the human resource development ministry was involved in the selection of the chairperson of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), The Telegraph has learnt.        
	Arjun has recommended that the appointments committee of the cabinet, headed by the Prime Minister, appoint IPS officer Pragya Srivastava to the top CBSE post. Srivastava is now joint director in charge of administration at the Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan.        
	Arjuns recommendation followed a selection process that broke with convention and proposed potential appointees without interviewing any applicant. The objective was to hurry and beat the declaration of the poll code of conduct in early March.        
	The standard procedure  followed even by the ministry in past appointments including those of CBSE chiefs  includes personal interaction with candidates. But the break with practice wasnt limited to the selection process.        
	The school education secretary, the boards controlling authority under the CBSE act, has always been a member of the committee tasked with choosing the board chairman. The secretary is the ministry representative on the panel.        
	When the CBSE chairpersons post fell vacant last year at the end of Ashok Gangulys tenure, a selection team set up to choose his successor had the school secretary as its member-secretary. That committee failed to find a suitable applicant after interviewing candidates.        
	But the search-cum-selection committee later nominated by Arjun, which short-listed Srivastava and two others, didnt include the school education secretary. Officials defending the decision argued that this was because the then secretary, Arun Kumar Rath, was about to retire.        
	Rath, who retired in January, has been replaced by former Archaeological Survey of India chief Anshu Vaish. But Vaish wasnt included in the committee, either. The result: the team didnt have any ministry representative.        
	The ministry has in the past changed the composition of committees midway if a member was no longer able to perform his or her duties. Why was that not done this time? asked a source unhappy with the procedure.        
	The search-cum-selection committee, it is learnt, officially made its choices known only to Arjun, not to any ministry official, unlike in the past. Arjun approved Srivastava from the shortlist of three.

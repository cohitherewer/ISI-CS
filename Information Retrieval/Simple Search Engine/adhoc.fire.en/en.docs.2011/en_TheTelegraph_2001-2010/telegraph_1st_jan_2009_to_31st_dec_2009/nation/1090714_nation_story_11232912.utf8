	Patna, July 13 (PTI): Making a strong pitch to rein in corruption, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar today said the menace was one of the main reasons behind the growth of Maoists in the country and condemned yesterdays attack in Chhattisgarh.        
	Nitish was talking to reporters after exercising his franchise at a polling booth here for elections to 24 Bihar legislative council seats from local authorities.        
	Replying to objections raised by political parties, including the RJD, regarding EVM and replacing them with a tamper-proof system, Nitish said EVMs or ballot papers would not affect JD(U) and added it was the duty of the EC to ensure free and fair poll.        
	Without naming RJD president Lalu Prasad, Nitish advised those who lost to concede their defeat gracefully and not blame machines.         
	I have requested the Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan to increase the number of courts for speedy disposal of corruption cases, Nitish said, coming back to the issue of corruption.        
	Currently there are 350 corruption cases waiting redressal, Nitish said, adding that the judiciary should devise a mechanism for speedy disposal of such cases. He said: Conviction in even one such case sends out a strong signal.        
	The Bihar chief minister warned that his government has decided to confiscate properties of corrupt officials and said over 30,000 criminals were punished through fast-tracks court ever since the NDA came to power in Bihar from November 2005.

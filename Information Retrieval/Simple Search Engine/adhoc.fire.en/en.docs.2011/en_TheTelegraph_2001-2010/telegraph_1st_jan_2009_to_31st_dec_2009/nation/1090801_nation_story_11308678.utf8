                                                                                                               Top IAS officer shoots self, family 
          OUR BUREAU                      A file photo of Jagadananda Panda. (Telegraph pix)                          
	July 31: Senior IAS officer Jagadananda Panda (54) was found dead with four members of his family at his ancestral home in Deogaon village of Bargarh district early this morning, while his 22-year-son was battling for his life in hospital.        
	Police suspect that Panda, working in the ministry of overseas Indian affairs, whose New Delhi office and residence was raided recently following an immigration scam, possibly shot his family, before killing himself.        
	The bullet-riddled bodies were found lying in a pool of blood, with doors of the house bolted from the inside. The deceased include Panda, his father, Munshi Panda (75), wife Surekha Panda (46), and sisters Bijayalaxmi (57) and Kishori Mishra (54). Pandas revolver was found at the site.         
	Sonu, who was also shot, has been admitted at VSS Hospital in a critical state, being tended by two surgeons flown in from Bhubaneswar to Burla.         
	The IAS officer died from a bullet injury on the right part of his forehead. The bullet passed through his head. The rest were shot from a distance of 5-feet, said inspector-general Yogesh Bahadur Khurania.        
	Pandas neighbours, who heard the gunshots, believe that the incident occurred in the early hours. His mother, who was on the first-floor of the house, rushed downstairs after hearing the gun shots to find her family dead. It was around 3am then. Neighbours took the family to VSS Medical College and Hospital (Burla) where five were declared brought dead.        
	Investigations are on into the matter. We are awaiting post-mortem reports, said IG Khurania. But, he pointed out to the circumstantial evidence and the documents found in the house to indicate that Panda probably killed himself after he shot his family.        
	The 1983-batch IAS officer had reached Bargarh on July 26 after being asked to go on a three-month leave after CBI raided his office and home following the scam. Panda was reportedly depressed since the raid, said his relatives.        
	Police have recovered a copy of his leave application for the period from July 22 to October 30 and two letters.         
	In one letter, he has pleaded innocence in the alleged scam, while in the other he has expressed his desire to bequeath his Bhubaneswar property to a niece and his ancestral property at Bargarh to his cousin brother.        
	Police have cordoned off his house and ballistic experts have reached the spot. Police sources said Panda had bought bullets from Jena Armoury on his arrival at Bhubaneswar. He is said to have driven to a place 5km away from his village and practised firing yesterday evening and fired three rounds on air, as disclosed by his driver.        
	Eight rounds of live catridges were also recovered from Pandas trousers during autopsy.        
	The incident has caused shock and grief among IAS officers. We all are shocked, he was a successful collector and had worked in three districts, said agriculture secretary and Pandas former colleague U.P. Singh. Right now, our main concern is saving his sons life, said home secretary A.P. Padhi.        
	Condoling Pandas untimely death, chief minister Naveen Patnaik said senior police officers were at the spot to investigate the incident.         
	An Orissa cadre IAS officer, Panda had earlier served the state as revenue divisional commissioner, school amp; mass education secretary and special relief commissioner.

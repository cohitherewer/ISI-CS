The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | IDOL Worship
                                                                                                               IDOL WORSHIP
  - Films pull crowds, but Chirus done with reel life         G.S. RADHAKRISHNA IN HYDERABAD                                                 
	Youngsters whistle and dance on the roads. Women  young and old  line up the road to see whether the actor they have worshipped on screen is as young and loveable in real life as well.        
	He is. At 54, Chiranjeevi, the swashbuckling hero of over 300 films who beat baddies black and blue, rescued damsels and the infirm from the clutches of villains, remains an idol even without the paint and mascara.        
	Ratna Manikyam, 60, toothless and frail, walked for five kilometres from her village to get a glimpse of her beloved hero who now heads the Praja Rajyam and has offered a political alternative different from the Telugu Desam and the Congress.         
	I have seen most of his films, including his latest flops. But I want to see him again and again. He is so loveable without even the lipstick or face cream, said Rajyalakshmim, Manikyams 24-year-old granddaughter who came with her eight-month-old child in her arms.        
	The small satellite town of Ibrahaminpatnam, about 60km northwest of Hyderabad, teemed with crowds of the young and old, college students, schoolgirls, day labourers and housewives to receive the actor.         
	They scaled buildings, trees and even lorries parked on the roads. Nearly 15,000 people gathered in a short period  four of them were injured when a compound wall collapsed under their weight. We all wish Chiranjeevi will be in a position to implement all of his promises and also re-enact his good samaritan roles in real life, said Rajyalakshmim.        
	The arrival of his caravan is announced by the loud blaring of the signature tune of one of Chiranjeevis popular films, Thakur. His caravan consists of three redone buses  one carrying sound systems and photographers, another ferrying his securitymen. Chiranjeevis vehicle comprises an airconditioned enclosure with three seats and a makeshift toilet.        
	His party is contesting in 20 of the states 42 Lok Sabha seats and in around 200 Assembly constituencies. The actor himself is contesting from two Assembly seats: Tirupati and Palacollu in West Godavari district.  
	In an interview to G.S. Radhakrishna of The Telegraph on board his campaign vehicle, Chiranjeevi spoke about his first love mdash; films mdash; and his latest passion mdash; politics          
	On actors turning politicians...        
	Artistes have more commitment than politicians, (he corrects it with some politicians later). I draw inspiration from artistes like MGR (MG Ramachandran) and NTR (NT Rama Rao), who were chosen by the people for their deep sense of commitment to the masses and their welfare.              
	On his experience so far...        
	I have been in politics for almost eight months since August 2008 when I launched Praja Rajyam at Tirupati. I have since addressed many regional meetings and countless roadshows. The success of these meetings drove some politicians to seek a ban on roadshows. (The ban was later relaxed).              
	On how different the two vocations  films and politics  are...        
	An actor gets a chance for a retake to give a better performance. But I feel the politician gets no such second chance. We are expected to do everything in a fool-proof manner at the first instance itself.               
	On his chances and criticism from rivals that he is a mere spoiler...        
	People look at me as an alternative to both the Congress and the Telugu Desam. I am not a spoiler or eating into their votebank. I am creating my own votebank of followers. Whats wrong if people want to support my slogan of social change?         
	On the recent trouble in his party (general secretary Parakala Prabhakar resigned a few days ago)...        
	Many veterans joined my organisation with the declaration of social service but vested interests got the better of them. Many of them are leaving as they could not be satisfied. It is difficult to fulfil the demands of all. It is true I invited them all as I had very little political experience. But no one should think I dont have any common sense and I wont see through their games.              
	On if he would continue acting, like many Bollywood filmstar-politicians...        
	No more films for me. I cannot ride on two horses. During my acting career, I had concentrated only on films. I cannot believe that in a single year I had released almost 30-40 films between 1982 and 85.        
	On his ambitions...        
	I have no ambition of becoming Prime Minister. I have focused only on the development of the state of Andhra Pradesh.              
	 Tirupati and Palacollu vote on April 23

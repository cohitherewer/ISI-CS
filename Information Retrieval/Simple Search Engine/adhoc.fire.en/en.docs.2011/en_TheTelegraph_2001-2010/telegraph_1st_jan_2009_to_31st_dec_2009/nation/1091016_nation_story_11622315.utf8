                                                                                                               Step-down breathing space for Raje 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Vasundhara                          
	New Delhi, Oct. 15: Vasundhara Raje, who was asked to quit as the leader of Opposition in Rajasthan two months ago, is likely to stay in her post for a while.        
	The BJP parliamentary board, the partys top decision-making body, was divided at its meeting here today on whether she ought to be pressured to quit at the earliest.        
	Raje is unlikely to be nudged even at the boards next meeting on October 22, when the results of the three state elections held on Tuesday will be declared.         
	Unless the BJP does well in one of the states  sources admitted it had stakes only in Maharashtra  party president Rajnath Singh, who is pushing for Rajes ouster, wont be in a position to do anything.        
	The sources said Raje had been asked to step down in the wake of the BJPs debacle in Rajasthan in the Lok Sabha polls this year.         
	By design or chance, sections of the BJP have assumed that Raje is being protected by L.K. Advani, who too kept his job as the leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha despite the partys defeat.        
	Raje was told by Rajnath to quit in August. The reasons for not doing so have ranged from viral illness to inauspicious stars, this months state elections, and even Diwali.        
	Parliamentary board member and Rajya Sabha MP M. Venkaiah Naidu, who was asked by Rajnath to persuade Raje, is now abroad on a parliamentary trip.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Jaguar staff accept pay freeze
                                                                                                               Jaguar staff accept pay freeze
          AMIT ROY      
	London, March 5: Workers at Tata-owned Jaguar Land Rover have voted 70-30 to accept a reduction of their working week from five days to four and a year-long pay freeze, it was announced today.        
	British car workers in past years have been assertive about protecting and improving their conditions of employment, but in the current climate they have obviously decided that it is preferable to retain their job, even for less money, than to have no job at all.        
	The workers were very frightened about the future of their industry and were prepared to make sacrifices, Pauline Doyle, a spokesperson for Unite, the union representing the majority of the employees, told The Telegraph.  
	They have played their part and made the sacrifices in trying to secure the future of their company, she said.        
	The deal was agreed between union leaders and the company, which has cut around 1,800 agency, production and management jobs in recent months. Workers at the companys sites, including Castle Bromwich and Solihull in the West Midlands and Halewood on Merseyside, took part in the ballot on the deal, which is aimed at saving up to 70 million in costs.        
	This does not mean the company is out of the woods, added Doyle. Many will feel Ratan Tata and his colleagues have a moral obligation to look after British workers who backed their purchase of two prestigious UK brands last year.        
	There has been no formal decision by the UK government on the substantial commercial loan, running into hundreds of thousands of pounds, Jaguar Land Rover is seeking.        
	Unite and GMB, another union representing Jaguar Land Rover workers, said in a joint statement today: We did not want our members in Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to be faced with the same fate as the thousands of others who have been dismissed in other companies.... The management agreed with our view that, when this unprecedented recession ends, the retention of a skilled and loyal workforce is an integral part to the ongoing success of this business.        
	Key elements of the package include a pay freeze until 2010, no compulsory redundancies in the non-management workforce in the UK over the next two years, a four-day week at the plants, a 40-hour working week for salaried employees with no increase in pay, full mobility of labour across the Jaguar Land Rover West Midlands sites and non-payment of a bonus for 2,400 salaried employees this year.        
	The deal was welcomed Jaguar Land Rover chief executive David Smith who said: This is an important step for us as a standalone business. It also confirms our determination as a team to steer Jaguar Land Rover through these extraordinary and challenging times.        
	Although this is a British deal, what happens here has implications for India Inc. The question is whether Ratan Tata, one of Indias most respected businessmen overseas, will be able to stick to his promise to safeguard British jobs.

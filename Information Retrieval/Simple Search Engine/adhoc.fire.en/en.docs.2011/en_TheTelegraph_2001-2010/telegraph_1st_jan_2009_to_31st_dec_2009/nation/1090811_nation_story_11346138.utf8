The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BSP rift over Maya statue spree
                                                                                                               BSP rift over Maya statue spree
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Mayavati statues at a park in Lucknow.                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 10: Old-timers in the Bahujan Samaj Party have faulted Mayavatis obsession with statues and parks, saying she has strayed from her mentor and party founder Kanshi Rams vision.        
	Some of them recently mustered the courage to tell her that if she wished to set up her statues and name parks after Dalit reformers, the drive should go hand in hand with more substantive programmes such as land for the landless, redistribution of surplus state land to Dalits, and jobs.        
	Otherwise, it amounts to megalomania. We paid a price for her excesses in the Lok Sabha elections, a Rajya Sabha MP from the party said.        
	Underlying the old Kanshi Ram loyalists impatience with Mayavati is a realisation that in the power stakes, they have been outnumbered by leaders who arrived from other parties. The BSP originals account for only three of the partys 12 Rajya Sabha seats and four of its 21 Lok Sabha seats.        
	The originals are those who have been in the BSP since Kanshi Ram founded it and had started out as activists of the partys previous avatars  the Dalit Shoshit Samaj Sangharsh Samiti and the All India Backward and Minority Communities Employees Federation.        
	The rest have come from other parties, some entering laterally, the most notable of them being Satish Mishra, Mayavatis chief political and legal adviser.        
	I was associated with the BSP from the time Manyawar (respected) Kanshi Ram used to go on his cycle yatras all over Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh to mobilise the Dalits, the Rajya Sabha MP said.        
	While he was guided solely by Babasahebs (Bhimrao Amebdkars) political philosophy, it never once crossed his mind that if the BSP came to power, its first agenda would be to deify its (living) leaders.        
	The old-timer lobby, out on a save BSP mission, say that if Mayavati leaves the partys fate to the likes of Mishra and her handpicked bureaucrats, as she has been doing now, it will be left without a future.        
	A Lucknow-based BSP functionary said: Even when she became chief minister for the first time (in 1995), she was taken up with the idea of installing statues of Amebdkar, Periyar and others. At that time, Kanshi Ram was around to tell her to go ahead but to also initiate some concrete measures.        
	Around then was born the idea of the Ambedkar Gram Yojana, under which some Dalit-dominated villages were chosen and given special grants for the development of education, health, irrigation, drinking water and roads.        
	Kanshi Ram loyalists admitted that the Congresss revival in Uttar Pradesh would hurt the BSP the most.        
	Rahul Gandhis message of statues versus development has hit home. Our people have started asking us, Where are the roads and wells for us? We are tired of looking at the CMs murtis (statues), one of them said.        
	The old-timers have also asked Mayavati to scrap the bhaichara (brotherhood) committees she has set up, ostensibly to promote kinship between the various castes and communities.        
	Because of the unequal power equations, the upper castes have used the committees to assert their supremacy over the backward classes and the Scheduled Castes, and to promote their own interests, a source said.

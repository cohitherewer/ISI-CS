                                                                                                               Magadh VC on court door 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, Sept. 3: ViceChancellor of Magadh University B.N. Pandey has gone into hiding after a criminal case was slapped on him, charging him of fraudulent conduct, forgery and of intimidating a government auditor examining university accounts.         
	The case can put the man behind bars for 10 years and was made after an inquiry, conducted by Magadh commissioner, found him guilty of threatening a government auditor after the state froze university accounts.        
	Divisional commissioner K.P. Rammaiah who inquired into the allegations following an uproar in Legislative Council indicted Pandey and also found him guilty of violating Sections 10(6) and 35 of the Bihar Universities Act, as well.         
	According to the report, an appointment racket was conducted from Pandeys residence and appointments were made against non-existent posts.        
	This is not the first time that Pandey has found himself on the wrong side of law. As the principal of a Motihari college, he was involved in criminal trespass and molestation of a sub-ordinates wife and nearly escaped from being lynched. Few years after the Motihari incident, Pandey was elevated to the post of Vice-Chancellor by former Bihar Governor R.S. Gavai.         
	Pandey is also facing contempt of court in Patna High Court for filing an allegedly false affidavit to evade appearance in court. Pandey was directed by the high court to appear on September 3, 2008.        
	Later, Pandey was found to be attending a public function at Gaya College, though he was supposedly ill by court records. Pandeys lawyer Ahsan Amanullah wrote a hard-hitting letter accusing the VC of breach of faith and refused to defend his case in the court.         
	Even earlier than that, a citizens watch group, Jagran Manch, lodged a complaint accusing Pandey of converting the university guesthouse into a brothel. The manch chargesheet was annexed with an FIR filed by regional deputy director (education) P.R. Kumar.         
	When contacted Gaya SP Sushil Khopde said that preliminary investigation into the new charges would be completed in five days time.

                                                                                                               Dont send us to Lanka: rescued Tamils
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, May 2: The 11 Sri Lankan Tamils, who escaped in a rickety boat from the island and were rescued mid-sea by Andhra Pradesh fishermen, dont want to go back.        
	Please dont send us back to the jaws of death, pleaded Niranjanala, a 32-year-old Lankan Tamil housewife, who was among the lucky 11 to survive the LTTE-army crossfire when they set sail from Mullaitivu, a strife-torn area in the islands north.        
	When the group set sail on April 28, there were 20 in the boat. Five of them died in the gun battle and four starved to death, among them Niranjanalas mother and six-year-old son.        
	The rescued 11 are being treated for exhaustion and diarrhoea since Thursday, when they were rescued near Kakinada in East Godavari district.         
	They had intended to land in Rameswaram but got lost in the sea and drifted towards Andhra. Speaking to The Telegraph from her bed at the Kakinada government hospital, Niranjanala said she preferred to die in India.        
	East Godavari district collector Gopalakrishna Dwivedi has visited the hospital and told them they would be sent to a refugee camp for Lankan Tamils in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu.         
	But they dont want to go to the camp fearing they would be sent back to Lanka later.         
	We have some money in banks that we can withdraw and start some business, said Shivraj Jagadeeswaran, one of the rescued.         
	But Dwivedi has said all Lankan nationals will stay in the Rameswaram camp, and only till a clearance for their return is obtained. The district administration has already faxed the identities and photographs of the 11 to the Lankan high commission in Chennai.

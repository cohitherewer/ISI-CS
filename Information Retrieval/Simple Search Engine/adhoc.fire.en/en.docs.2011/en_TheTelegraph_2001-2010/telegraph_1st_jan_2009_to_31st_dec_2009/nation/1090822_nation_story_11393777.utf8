                                                                                                               Reprieve for tainted mine boss
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Aug. 21: The director of mines, R.N. Sahoo, believed to be the prime witness in the alleged Rs 110-crore mining scam in Orissa, got a reprieve when the high court gave him interim protection against arrest till August 26.        
	Sahoo has evaded the state vigilance sleuths probing into the scam since it submitted a preliminary report to the government on August 7 and stepped up efforts to take him into custody for interrogation. He had obtained leave and was not available in his house.        
	He had tried to attain anticipatory bail. The vigilance bureau opposed the bail plea on the basis of simple assumption that the irregularities could not have happened without the knowledge of the director of mines.        
	Justice Indrajit Mohanty, however, granted the interim protection. The court also directed Sahoo to appear in the court of the chief judicial magistrate, Balasore, and apply for regular bail. The government today rejected further extension of his leave, which lapsed yesterday.                     
	The high court further allowed regular bail applications filed by seven officials of the mining and forest departments for Rs 50,000 bail bond and two sureties each. All of them, arrested on August 12, were refused bail by the court of chief judicial magistrate, Balasore and remanded in jail custody till August 25.

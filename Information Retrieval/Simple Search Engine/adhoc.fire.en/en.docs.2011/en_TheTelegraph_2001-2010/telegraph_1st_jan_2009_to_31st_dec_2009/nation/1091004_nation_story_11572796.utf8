The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pakistan fails commitment test
                                                                                                               Pakistan fails commitment test
  - Case delay to prolong talks freeze          K.P. NAYAR                          Shahbaz Rajput, the defence lawyer for the seven Mumbai-attack suspects, outside the Adiala jail in Rawalpindi on Saturday. (AFP)                                        
	Washington, Oct. 3: Any hopes of an early resumption of the composite dialogue between India and Pakistan were dashed today when the trial of seven conspirators behind the attacks on Mumbai last year was postponed in the high-security Adiala jail in Rawalpindi, the seat of an anti-terrorism court that has been set up for this purpose.        
	Pakistans foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi had categorically assured external affairs minister S.M. Krishna in New York last Sunday that the trial would start on October 3 and that it would be proof of Islamabads commitment to bring the perpetrators of the 26/11 attacks to justice.        
	Taking a firm stand in New York that amounted to rolling back a bilateral initiative between Islamabad and New Delhi made public after a meeting in Egypt between the Prime Ministers of the two countries in July, Krishna had scoffed at Qureshis insistence that the cases against the seven accused amounted to sincere Pakistani action against those plotting cross-border attacks on India.        
	Do you expect me to believe that just seven men planned a huge terrorist operation in Mumbai? Krishna had asked Qureshi who said India and Pakistan should resume their composite dialogue without bracketing it with terrorism as mentioned in a July joint statement in Sharm-el-Sheikh, Egypt.        
	When Krishna insisted that the composite dialogue would resume only when India saw tangible results on cross-border terrorism based on dossiers handed over by India, Qureshi dragged Manmohan Singhs name into the discussions and implied that the foreign minister was going against what the Prime Minister had told his Pakistani counterpart in Egypt.                          Krishna and (above) Qureshi: Tough talk      
	Krishna then turned the tables on Qureshi and quoted Singhs firm statement on Pakistan at a news conference in Pittsburgh on September 25, according to Indian sources.         
	Indias message is that it seeks to normalise its relations with Pakistan. But the only obstacle is that Pakistan should give up its old attitude regarding the use of terror as an instrument of state policy, Singh had said at the conclusion of the G20 summit.        
	Qureshi then said more than 100 suspects in Pakistan were under investigation for their role in the Mumbai attacks.        
	Krishna took the view that talks would continue with Pakistan, but there would be no dialogue. That meant Krishna would continue to meet Qureshi and the two foreign secretaries would talk if their paths crossed at any multilateral forum.        
	The Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan would probably meet in Trinidad and Tobago on the sidelines of the Commonwealth summit in November, although Krishna was non-committal when asked about it. We have just come out of one meeting. Give us some time, he said in New York.        
	It is clear that the Indian strategy to keep talking will eliminate any pressure from the international community, particularly the US, on the two countries to engage each other.        
	But the composite dialogue, started in 2004 and covering eight subjects ranging from water-related disputes, Siachen, terrorism, drug trafficking and economic co-operation, will not be resumed for now.        
	Todays postponement of the court hearing in the case against seven accused terrorists is a setback for Pakistans civilian government after Qureshis assurance to Krishna.        
	New Delhi had viewed the assurance as a test of the civilian governments ability to pursue an agenda on India within the multi-layered Pakistani system in which elected officials often have the trappings of power, but no authority.        
	No reason was given for the court adjournment at the time of writing. Among those facing the charges are Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, said to be the brain behind the Mumbai carnage, and Zarar Shah, a leader of the Lashkar-e-Toiba.

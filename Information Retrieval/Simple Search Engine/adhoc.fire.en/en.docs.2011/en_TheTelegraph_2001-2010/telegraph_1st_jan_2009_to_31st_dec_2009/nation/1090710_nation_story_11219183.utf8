The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Maoist racket runs deep
                                                                                                               Maoist racket runs deep
                            
	Raipur, July 9 (PTI): The countrys Maoist rebels are extorting up to $60 million annually from business and industry across Chhattisgarh state, home to Indias largest mineral reserves, chief minister Raman Singh said today.        
	Maoists recently stepped up attacks against police, officials and civilians away from remote rural areas and closer to towns and cities across India  a worry to potential investors as the country grapples with the global slowdown.        
	State business leaders and politicians are jittery over Chhattisgarh, whose violence-wracked Bastar is home to 20 per cent of Indias iron ore and has attracted big hitters such as Tata Steel and Essar Group.        
	The extortion operation stretches from the states southern tip near Bastar to the northern area of Surguja, rich in coal. Rebels demand cash from traders of tendu, used to make cigarettes, mining firms, contractors and transporters.

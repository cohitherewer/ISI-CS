The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Little to tackle downturn, says Left
                                                                                                               Little to tackle downturn, says Left
          JAYANTH JACOB                              
	New Delhi, July 6: Left parties today said the budget was inconsequential in meeting the challenges of the economic downturn and slammed the contradictions of a government torn between the aam aadmi and its eagerness to pursue liberalisation.        
	CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury said though a lot had been talked about the aam aadmi, the actual allocations did not match the intent to help them. The contradictions are unfolding, with tangible benefits going to the shining India and not to the suffering India.         
	(The) Budget neither provides a stimulus for growth nor meets the needs of inclusive growth for the aam aadmi, the politburo said.        
	The budget is inconsequential as the government is clueless on how to address the economic crisis, the job losses and lift the agriculture sector, CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta said.        
	Although Yechury welcomed gestures for Bengal like the Rs 1,000-crore package to rehabilitate Aila victims, the proposal for handloom clusters and financial assistance for opening an Aligarh Muslim University branch, the budget came in for flak for providing little support to some vital sectors. The CPM said crucial sectors, such as agriculture and rural development, where the effects of the agrarian crisis have been severe, had been provided little support.        
	The party said the allocation required to implement the right to education policy was shockingly absent and that for social security schemes for unorganised sector workers was only Rs 100 crore more than last year.        
	The abolition of the fringe benefit tax and commodities transaction tax will also adversely impact tax mobilisation, the politburo said. The budget, it added, was revenue neutral on the direct tax front. Direct tax revenues, the party said, are expected to increase by 7 per cent only, which is much less than the nominal growth of the GDP.        
	The Left also slammed the move to give 100 per cent tax exemption to corporate donations to political parties. It will be the fountainhead of all political corruption, Yechury said.        
	The Left said it suspected the government would resort to divestment to meet the fiscal deficit. Yechury said it amounted to selling family silver. We have been opposing this throughout.

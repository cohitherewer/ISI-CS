                                                                                                               Two-hour siege in Orissa
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 8: Hundred armed Maoists blew up a police station at Baipariguda and an outpost at Ramagiri around 10.30pm last night.        
	A sub-inspector, two assistant sub-inspectors and two constables were dragged outside the police station and trussed up.         
	The attack reportedly was in protest against yesterdays arrest of Maoist leader Azad by the Andhra Pradesh police. A few weeks ago, Orissa police had arrested Uday, the third in command in the state.        
	The slew of attacks continued as the rebels damaged a high-frequency transmitter and laid siege to the Baipariguda police station for over two hours, triggering three explosions. The men torched two jeeps and three motorcycles parked outside the police station. Then they proceeded to torch another outpost at Ramgiri, 30km from Baipariguda. They also blasted a BSNL tower and destroyed a CRPF barrack.        
	Finally before leaving they pasted posters asking for the Azads release mentioning that the men belonged to the Malkangiri border division of CPI(Maoist). The rebels also felled trees along the roads leading to Malkangiri and Koraput to obstruct the movement of police.         
	There has been no casualty, said deputy inspector-general (southwest range) Sanjeeb Kumar Panda. A team of anti-Naxalite SOG of personnel was despatched to Baipariguda for a combing operation, while security was beefed up. Additional forces were also rushed to the area.

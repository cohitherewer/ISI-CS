          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Nov. 3: Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi today demanded a probe into a nexus between Lalu Prasad and Madhu Koda, who is being grilled by tax authorities under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.        
	The investigating agencies must examine the relationship between the former Jharkhand chief minister (Koda) and the RJD boss besides the Congress leaders, too, who supported the Koda-led government, Modi said.        
	He added that the investigation into the nexus between Koda, Lalu and Congress leaders would unravel the truth behind siphoning of such a huge amount from the state exchequer. Modi said that the Koda government was functioning on the oxygen supplied by Lalu and the Congress. Lalu got the government led by an Independent MLA and kept on supporting it with all his might, he said.                                
	The RJD boss has several fodder scam cases against him being tried in Jharkhand courts. Lalu Prasad supported the Koda government, as he wanted a pliable government at his disposal in the neighbouring state, Modi, who is also a petitioner in the fodder scam cases against Lalu Prasad, alleged.

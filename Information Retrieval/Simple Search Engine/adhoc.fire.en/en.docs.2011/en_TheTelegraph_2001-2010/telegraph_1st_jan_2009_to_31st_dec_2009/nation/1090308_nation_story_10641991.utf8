	Mumbai, March 7 (PTI): India will join the rest of the world to observe Earth Hour by switching off all lights and electrical appliances for an hour from 8.30pm on March 28.         
	Earth Hour was observed in 35 countries last year in an attempt to reduce the carbon footprint, the education officer of World Wide Fund for Nature (India), Goldin Quadros, said today.        
	This year, India, especially Delhi and Mumbai, will participate, he said, adding that WWF was getting support from the government and corporate houses. Lights will be switched off or dimmed at 11 PVR cinemas in Delhi and Mumbai and at corporate offices.        
	According to WWF, 50 lakh citizens of 377 cities in 74 nations are participating in the initiative this year.         
	Kick-starting the campaign at the IIT, Mumbai mayor Shubha Raul said it was important to cut down carbon level and the municipality was keen to help in the endeavour.

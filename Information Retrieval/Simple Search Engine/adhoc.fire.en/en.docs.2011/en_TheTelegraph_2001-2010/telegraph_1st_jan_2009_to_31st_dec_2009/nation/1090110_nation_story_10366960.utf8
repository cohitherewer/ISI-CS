	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 9: Men who pursue Odissi are often sidelined by women pursuing the same dance form. But now they have a reason to cheer.        
	In an attempt to go beyond the popular image and instil determination to face all odds in young male dancers, Odissi dance institute Srjan has organised the Guru Kelucharan Mohapatra Purush Dance Festival.        
	The exclusive festival for male dancers started here last evening in collaboration with the Utkal Sangeet Mahavidyalaya. During three decades of travel and performance with Guruji, I have frequently observed the plight of talented male dancers who are frequently sidelined, admits Ratikanta Mohapatra, son of Odissi doyen Guru Kelucharan Mohapatra.        
	History says male gurus used to carry the tradition down the ages. Despite the fact, the audience needs to be coaxed to appreciate the unique expression of male dancer and the nuances in his performance. As males, our families expect us to earn. Odissi as a profession is not so rewarding. The case is worse with male dancers. It is urgently required that the male dancer be accorded the right status and opportunity that he deserves, said Lucky Parajnya Mohanty.        
	The need of the hour is to create a viable platform to showcase the talent and capacity of good male dancers. This festival is a welcome change and will certainly create a viable performance space for the male dancer and acknowledge with respect their status in our society, Mohanty added.        
	The three-day festival will have performances by Rashmi Ranjan Jena, Bhabananda Barbayan, Amulya Kumar Balbantray, Narayan Pandey, Monojit Saha, Lucky Prajnya Mohanty, Uday Kumar Shetty, Partha Protim Das and Bijan Kumar Palai among others.        
	The event will also have different sessions of national seminar with topics like Purusha Anga Soundarjya (The aesthetics of male body movement); Stri Anga Soundarjya (The aesthetics of female body movement); the origin, development and tradition of Odissi music, and the origin, development and tradition of Odissi Mardala.

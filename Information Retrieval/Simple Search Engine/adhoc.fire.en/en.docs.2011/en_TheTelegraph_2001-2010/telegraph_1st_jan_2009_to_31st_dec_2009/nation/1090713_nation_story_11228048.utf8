The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lalu seeks cadre support
                                                                                                               Lalu seeks cadre support
          NALIN VERMA                          War of words: Nitish Kumar, Lalu Prasad                                  
	Patna, July 12: With Lady luck not smiling on Lalu Prasad nowadays, the RJD boss has been hitting the streets to complain to party workers at the grassroots about the RJD plight.         
	Soon after the RJD debacle in the Lok Sabha polls, the embattled chief had announced that he would start from scratch and resurrect RJDs fortunes.         
	I will go the masses and will find out why they favoured others over the RJD. I will go to New Delhi only during Lok Sabha sessions and will spend the rest of the time strengthening my partys organisational strength, Lalu had announced in his first response to the partys poor show.         
	It is not clear yet as to what the eventual result of his efforts would be, but Lalu Prasad has been doing what he had stated after the poll results.         
	Using the break from the Houses session, the RJD boss went to Purnea yesterday, convened a workers meeting and gave a pep talk to keep the morale high. Today the RJD boss was in Bhagalpur doing the same.         
	He is expected to attend more such meetings before he flies to New Delhi to attend the Houses session from tomorrow.         
	Look at the plight of our party, Lalu told the RJD cadre, asking: Do you know how it has happened?         
	Then before giving others a time to reply the man himself said: It happened because of the lack of unity among the poor. Nitish Kumar believes in the divide and rule policy.         
	Recently, his successor and present railway minister, Mamata Banerjee, tried to run Lalu Prasad down by questioning the Indian Railways turnaround and threatened to bring a White Paper out on his performance.         
	Even Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and finance minister Pranab Mukherjee who showered praise on their former cabinet colleagues (Lalus) role as the railway minister have either kept silent or have tacitly supported Mamatas decision.         
	Fearing that Lalu Prasad may revive his party again in the state, ruling JD(U) has wholeheartedly supported Mamata Banerjees move.         
	I am happy that Mamataji is bringing out a White Paper. It will expose the former railway ministers false claims, Nitish Kumar had stated in his reaction to the railway budget.         
	A few days after the Bihar chief ministers comment, RJD legislator Sanjay Singh demanded a CBI probe into the appointments made by Lalu Prasad during his tenure. He alleged that the former railway minister resorted to irregularities in the appointment of Grade-VI staff in the railways.         
	Lalu Prasad also faces the threat of losing his place in the front row of the Lok Sabha with his party winning only four seats. Speaker Meira Kumar has hinted that she would go by the formula in allotment of seats which might end up in Lalu being relegated to the back benches.         
	However, Lalu instead of drawing the attention of his former friends Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi, has preferred to lodge his complaint with the people. I had occupied an important post in Delhi not because of others but because of you, because of the powers granted to me by you the power of mandate. Now I do not have that power for you fell prey to the divide and rule politics and voted for an anti-poor government, he said to his cadre.         
	To prove Mamata wrong, he said: I will continue to claim that the Indian Railways registered a profit of Rs 88,000 core during my tenure. Out of the profit, railways paid over Rs 21,000 crore dividend to the Centre. How did it pay a dividend if it did not have the surplus cash.

  - Nitish party says ally worked against it in Jharkhand, silent on plans for Bihar Assembly polls        NISHIT DHOLABHAI                           Sharad Yadav with Nitish Kumar at the JD(U) meeting in Delhi on Saturday. (Rajesh Kumar)                                        
	New Delhi, May 30: Voices against the BJP were loud and clear at the Janata Dal (United) national executive that began here today, throwing open the possibility of the NDA partners splitting even before the Assembly elections in Bihar next year.         
	Dal(U) leaders from states where the parties shared seats, especially Jharkhand besides Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, accused the BJP of non-cooperation during the elections.         
	General secretary and spokesperson Shivanand Tiwari said local BJP workers in Jharkhand not only refused to help the two Dal(U) candidates but worked against them.         
	We experienced similar problems on some seats in Bihar and also in Uttar Pradesh; the BJP also raised some questions which should not have been raised, Tiwari said at the end of the first day of the two-day meet.         
	Party leader Sharad Yadav has already blamed the BJP for the NDAs defeat.         
	With Nitish Kumar getting the mandate for the Dal(U), the party is looking ahead to the Assembly elections. In the Lok Sabha elections, the Dal(U) contested 25 of the 40 seats in Bihar, leaving the rest for the BJP. It fought two seats each in Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh as a BJP ally.        
	But Jharkhand state unit leader Janeshwar Mahto said the BJP had helped the opponents in Chatra and Palamu, sources said.         
	Even during the elections, the party had appeared to be moving away from the BJP and towards the third front.        
	Tiwari today said that as the biggest partner in the NDA, the BJP should instil confidence among allies. It was a negative vote against the Opposition, he said of the election results, without naming the BJP. There should be analysis on these aspects within the party that wanted to form the government and have its Prime Minister.        
	For now, the Dal(U) is treading cautiously and has expressed confidence in the 42-month coalition government in Bihar. There was no discussion on breaking away from the BJP, said Tiwari, skirting a question whether his party is sure of contesting the Assembly polls in Bihar as part of the NDA.         
	In the political resolution moved today by senior leader K.C. Tyagi and seconded by Tiwari, the party demanded that Dalit Muslims be offered sops on a par with other Dalits. It also raised Nitishs main demand of special status for Bihar.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ammo to stun rebels, not kill 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Ammo to stun rebels, not kill 
          SUJAN DUTTA                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 11: A palm-sized dazzler pistol that will freeze a human target for 30 seconds, stun grenades stuffed with chilli powder, suffocating smoke bombs and radars to see through the green cover of forests  these are the projects taken up by the Defence Research and Development Organisation to tackle Maoists.        
	The DRDO has been given a mandate to develop technologies to aid central paramilitary and state forces against home-grown insurgencies, a senior officer of the organisation told The Telegraph today. So far, most of our research and development projects were for conventional warfare or for cross-border terrorism. Now we have been specifically asked to come up with products for home-grown insurgencies, the officer said.        
	The philosophy behind these weapons is to incapacitate the enemy and reduce collateral damage, rather than to kill, the scientist said.        
	The prototypes of the technologies were demonstrated to senior officers and representatives of the armed forces and the central paramilitary forces at a workshop for low intensity conflict operations at the DRDO headquarters.        
	The DRDOs record in producing technologies for the armed forces leaves most senior officers of the army, navy and the air force cold. The products, beginning with the major missiles such as the Agni, either do not match up to international standards or are way behind schedule or both.        
	Some products on the list:        
	Suffocating smoke bombs: 84mm grenades filled with a chemical that will make it impossible for a person to stay inside a closed area and force him out        
	Piezo Electric Sensors: For use in the perimeter of establishments such as police camps. They will detect the change in air pressure if a human is within its range and trigger an alarm        
	High Power Microwave Guns: An adoption of the technology of microwave ovens, these hand-held devices will generate so much heat aimed at a target that it will be impossible for a human being to stay in its vicinity        
	Netra: A vertically-launched hand-sized remotely controlled unmanned aerial vehicle fitted with two cameras.

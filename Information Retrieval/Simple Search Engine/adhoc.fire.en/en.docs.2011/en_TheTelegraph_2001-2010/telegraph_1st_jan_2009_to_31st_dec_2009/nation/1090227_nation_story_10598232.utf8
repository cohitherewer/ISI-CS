The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pindi link to 26/11 colonel

          OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES                              
	Mumbai/Islamabad, Feb. 26: A Pakistani telecom provider under the armys administrative control has in its ranks a Colonel R. Saadat Ullah, a name that figures in the 26/11 chargesheet.        
	Saadat is an army officer attached to the Rawalpindi-headquartered Special Communications Organisation (SCO), under Pakistans information and technology ministry. The SCO is the largest telecom provider in PoK and the Northern Areas.        
	Sources said only the SCOs budget was under civilian control; its administration was vested with the army and its officers were drafted from the Corps of Signals.        
	The chargesheet, filed yesterday, names a Colonel Saadat Ullah and a major general among 35 Pakistani accused. The SCO chief (director-general) is Major General Muhammad Khalid Rao, a Corps of Signals officer.        
	If the colonel named in the chargesheet is the one working in the SCO, it would be the most specific allegation of the Pakistani establishments direct involvement in 26/11.        
	Sources said the Mumbai police stumbled on Saadat during their hunt for Kharak Singh, the ostensible user of a Yahoo email ID used to open a VoIP account with Callphonex, a US-based service provider.         
	The ID was accessed from several Internet Protocol addresses and one of them turned out to be the colonels official ID. The Internet address has been traced to Qasim Road, Rawalpindi.        
	Among the 35 are Lashkar-e-Toiba commanders Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi and Zarar Shah, both said to be under arrest in Pakistan, and the outfits founder, Hafiz Muhammad Sayeed. This is the first time that Sayeed has figured in a chargesheet.        
	Mumbai joint commissioner of police Rakesh Maria yesterday said the police were yet to establish if the two men with army designations were indeed serving officers or members of the Lashkar, which often uses military ranks for its commanders.        
	The chargesheet says the colonel was in constant touch with the 10 Mumbai gunmen, all Lashkar members. Indian sleuths allege the colonel had trained the terrorists in phone conversations through Voice over Internet Protocol.        
	Pakistani military and foreign office officials have rejected the charges. A senior military official said there would be several Colonel Saadat Ullahs in the Pakistani army. It is not for us to speculate unless India can provide something more substantial.        
	Mumbai police officers concede it would not be easy to track down the 35 Pakistanis, 18 of whom have Abu as a name. Lashkar allegedly uses the stock name Abu to conceal operatives identity.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                     
	New Delhi , Aug 24: The government is believed to have pencilled Pakistan out of the agenda of a high-profile conference of Indian heads of mission in a controversial move to stymie widespread misgivings among top diplomats over the Sharm-el-Sheikh joint statement between Prime Ministers Manmohan Singh and Yousaf Raza Gilani.         
	Reliable sources told The Telegraph that although Indias neighbourhood will come up for detailed exchange of views tomorrow, the second day of the conference, Pakistan will not be on the table.         
	The sources did not ascribe any reasons to this glaring omission from a discussion on Indias neighbourhood, but they may be quite obvious.         
	The cream of the Indian diplomatic corps is sour over the Sharm-el-Sheikh statement, especially the unprecedented mention of Pakistani concerns in Balochistan, and the government probably fears a discussion would mean opening a can of worms.         
	Indian ambassadors and high commissioners to 112 nations are currently gathered for a five-day annual meeting which was inaugurated by external affairs minister S.M. Krishna today.         
	The entire gamut of foreign policy concerns from global economy to defence to climate change and culture is slated for discussions over the next few days, but not what participants most wanted to talk about: what prompted India to delink terror from talks in the language of the Sharm-el-Sheikh statement and why India acquiesced to a mention of Balochistan.         
	Some foreign office sources hinted at a closed briefing to select top officials on the current dynamics of the Indo-Pak relationship, but even if such a session is held, it is likely to leave the majority of invited diplomats agitated and angered. This is a meeting of Indian diplomats holding key posts globally, for gods sake, exclaimed one senior foreign service officer. If the government cannot take us into confidence and explain to us the exigencies of the joint statement, who will it do that with?         
	The Singh-Gilani joint statement had caused a political furore back home; the misgivings were not the Oppositions alone, influential sections of the ruling Congress too are believed to have felt Prime Minister Singh gave away too much for a shot at peace with Pakistan.         
	The agitation over the joint statement is genuine and widespread among us, said a senior Indian diplomat. We have been hard put to explain or defend the statement in foreign capitals and it will be unfortunate if a discussion on it is not part of this conference.         
	The Prime Minister has made several clarifications subsequent to the joint statement, harking back to a harder position and unequivocally ruling out composite dialogue with Pakistan in the absence of credible, demonstrable and sustainable action against the Mumbai terror plotters and the Pakistan-based terror network as a whole.         
	These statements, made on the floor of Parliament as well, have failed to assuage concerns, though, and the Indian diplomatic corps in particular have remained critical in private. The decision of the government, now, to scrap an open-house-closed-door interaction on Pakistan is only likely to deepen reservations about the joint statement among the countrys top diplomats.         
	Although a press release issued by the ministry of external affairs made no mention of it, foreign minister Krishna is believed to have restated Indian concerns over Pakistans reluctance to act against the terror network. In a clear reference to Jamat-ud-Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed, Krishna told the conference that Islamabad was reluctant to prosecute some against whom evidence is incontrovertible.        
	Calling upon top diplomats to make the Indian point of view known effectively and appropriately, Krishna said if Pakistan was willing to show statesmanship and vision, India would meet it more than half way in the interests of peace in the region.         
	On several occasions we have conveyed to the Pakistani leadership our desire to engage in meaningful discussions and to develop our bilateral relations in a positive manner. At the same time, we made it clear that a meaningful dialogue will only be possible following the fulfilment by Pakistan of its commitment not to allow its territory to be used for terrorist activities against India. Pakistan must honour the pledges made in this regard. Following the Mumbai attacks of 26 November, 2008, Pakistan has taken some steps under the pressure of evidence presented to them. However, we are still to see Pakistan take effective steps to end infiltration and dismantle the infrastructure of terrorism, Krishna said.

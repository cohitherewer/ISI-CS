	New Delhi, March 30: Pakistan and Afghanistan will figure prominently when Manmohan Singh meets Barack Obama on Thursday on the sidelines of the G20 summit in London.        
	The situation in the region, including Pakistan and Afghanistan, will certainly come up, foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon said today.        
	The US President unveiled his Afpak policy last week, indicating he wanted Indias involvement in the battle against the Taliban. New Delhi believes that Afghan extremism has its roots in Pakistan.        
	Singh, who leaves for the summit tomorrow, has another bilateral meeting scheduled in London  with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown on April 1.        
	At the summit, Singh is expected to put across New Delhis views on the ways to deal with the global meltdown. Among other things, he will speak on the need to combat western protectionism, reform international financial structures and make credit to build infrastructure easily available to poor countries.        
	Menon spoke of a growing concern about non-trade barriers being raised, in the form of preferences for domestic companies for government procurement and bars on the movement of professionals.

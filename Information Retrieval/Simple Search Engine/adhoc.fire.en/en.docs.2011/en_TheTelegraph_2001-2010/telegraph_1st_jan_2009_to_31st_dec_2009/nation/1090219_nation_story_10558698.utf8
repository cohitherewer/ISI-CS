	New Delhi, Feb. 18: An eight-year-old boy was kidnapped and then murdered before the ransom could be paid.         
	The body of Rahul Sharma, the son of a car driver, was found in a field in outer Delhi last evening. The boy had not returned from school yesterday.        
	The kidnappers, who are yet to be identified, called his home and demanded Rs 20,000. A few hours later, the ransom was scaled up to Rs 30,000 and then Rs 30 lakh.         
	Rahul, the son of Lalit Sharma, studied in a municipal school in outer Delhi. School officials said he did attend classes yesterday, but added that he went to the toilet and did not return.         
	The father filed a case of kidnapping, after which the police found the body. The police suspect a family feud could be behind the murder.

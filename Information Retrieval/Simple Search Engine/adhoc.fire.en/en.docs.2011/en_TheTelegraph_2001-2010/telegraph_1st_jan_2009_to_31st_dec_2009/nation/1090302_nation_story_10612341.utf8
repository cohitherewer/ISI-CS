The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pawar wags Sena finger at Sonia
                                                                                                               Pawar wags Sena finger at Sonia
  - NCP chief drops non-Congress hint        RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Pawar: Power play                                         
	New Delhi, March 1: If Mulayam Singh Yadav briefly raised the BJP bogey to frighten the Congress into submission in Uttar Pradesh, Sharad Pawar is using the Shiv Sena to warn the party that if push comes to shove, he would look at other options.        
	Just like the Samajwadi Party chief two weeks ago said he had no problem going with the BJP if it dropped its Ram temple and common civil code planks, Pawar has made it clear he is not allergic to the Sena. The Thackerays have reciprocated the sentiment by declaring they might back him for Prime Minister.        
	The Congress has not yet released its first list of Lok Sabha candidates or stitched up new alliances, but one of its existing partners from Maharashtra, Pawars Nationalist Congress Party, has begun redrawing the ground rules.         
	The Congresss only objective is to ensure the NCP does not contest more than 17 of the 48 seats in Maharashtra so that Pawars prime ministerial ambitions and agenda of forming a third alternative are nipped in the bud.         
	Pawar, however, said at a party convention in Nashik today that the Congress must part with half the seats (24). He also asked the Congress to share the Maharashtra chief ministers post with the NCP, as it had done in Jammu and Kashmir till last year in a coalition with the Peoples Democratic Party. For the two terms that the Congress-NCP combine ruled Maharashtra, the Congress had walked away with the top job.        
	Congress sources rejected Pawars call, saying it had given away the chief ministers job to the National Conference after the Kashmir elections in the interest of upholding propriety and stability.        
	The National Conference was the single largest party and we cannot deny them the privilege of office, a source said.        
	Congress leaders said the rotational model had been a disaster whenever it was used. The experiment had brought down the BJP-BSP regime in Uttar Pradesh and the Congress-PDP coalition in Jammu and Kashmir when one chief minister had to pass the baton to his/her successor, they said.        
	But even as they rebuffed Pawars demand, the Congress leaders sounded worried about what would happen to the Maharashtra government  which has eight months left  if the partys ties with the NCP snapped before the Lok Sabha polls.        
	They admitted that Maharashtra and Haryana were the only A-list states left with the Congress  Delhi was thought of as disproportionately  important  compared to Gujarat, Karnataka and Punjab in the BJPs kitty.        
	The sources rued that while the NCP used the 10-year tenure to consolidate its grasp over grassroots structures, the Congresss top-heavy apparatus only nurtured factions, patronised by the Delhi and Mumbai bosses.        
	Pawars base on the ground is much stronger than ours, which is why his insistence on a 50-50 seat-sharing isnt that unreasonable, a Congress source acknowledged.        
	The Pawar-baiters, however, insisted that he could not change principles on a whim and expect more than 21 seats. He will also have to share seats with other allies. The idea is to ensure the NCP doesnt fight more than 17, an office-bearer said.        
	The Congress has indicated it will not give away a single seat from its kitty. The only exception will be if it manages to rope in a new ally, such as Prakash Ambedkars Republican Party of India.

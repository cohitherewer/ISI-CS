          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 2: P. Chidambaram today stressed the distinction between pre-poll and post-poll alliances to argue the UPA had not been stymied by the flight of allies or Sharad Pawars dalliance with the third front.        
	The home minister also invoked a law of nature to hope that even the Left  the third fronts moving force  would back the Congress after the elections.        
	Please understand there are pre-poll and post-poll alliances. Go back to 2004. All the parties in the UPA were not pre-poll parties. Some were pre-poll and some were post-poll. Why should it be different now? Chidambaram said.        
	He indicated that his party was unhappy with Pawars decision to be at Fridays third front rally in Bhubaneswar, but claimed it would not affect the Congress.        
	Why should we be worried? He (Pawar) has an alliance with the Congress in Maharashtra. I am told there is an effort to stitch an alliance in Gujarat and Goa. It will be good if he did not share a platform with the parties in the third front that are opposed to the Congress in Orissa.        
	Asked if the Left was the Congresss natural ally, he replied: Our fight is indeed against communalism. The Left is also against communalism. So if it becomes necessary for forces ranged against communalism to come together, I am sure the very law of nature you talked about will apply.        
	The Congress has decided not to over-react to allies agendas even if these end up hurting it on the ground, sources said. For instance, there are doubts if the Congress and the NCP can mutually transfer their votes after Pawars new venture.        
	The party has already clarified its position that we do not have an alliance with any party at the national level, chief spokesperson Janardhan Dwivedi said. Whatever Pawar is doing in Orissa, it is for him to think if it is correct ethically.        
	Chidambaram, asked if Manmohan Singhs candidature for Prime Minister could be rethought at allies instance, said: Who will be at the helm of affairs, the Congress will decide. The Congress has declared Manmohan Singh as the Prime Minister. Everybody has to work out their options recognising that fact.        
	He dismissed the BJPs insinuation that Pranab Mukherjee was sulking at being passed over for the top job.         
	Pranab Mukherjee is not sulking. He is a mature leader who chooses his words carefully, Chidambaram said.        
	Mukherjee had made four points in a TV interview: Sonia Gandhi was more at ease with Singh than with anyone else; Singh was a superior intellectual while he was a political worker, his Hindi was flawed; he came from a state in which the Congresss stakes were not really high.         
	The BJP viewed Mukherjees remarks as ironical rather than innocuous.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Congress gag on officials
                                                                                                               Congress gag on officials
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sonia Gandhi                                  
	New Delhi, June 28: The Congress has advised its functionaries not to comment out of turn on policy matters or sound more Left than the Left or like the BJPs Murli Manohar Joshi.        
	The party has issued orders that all officials can convey to Sonia Gandhi and her aides any reservations they have with the Centres policy announcements or the conduct of individual ministers.        
	Sources said that if the party saw merit in their opinions, it would take up the issue at an appropriate forum, such as the core committee that meets on Fridays and has Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia as members.        
	The orders have been issued in the context of the criticism levelled at human resource development minister Kapil Sibals blueprint for education reform last week.        
	A Congress official, who counts himself as close to Sonia, had talked openly of how the minister transgressed his mandate by going public with the roadmap without consulting anybody.        
	He had said that before unrolling changes that struck at the kernel of the education system, Sibal should have met Congress Working Committee members and representatives of the parliamentary standing committee on human resource development.        
	A Congress central minister had also taken a swipe at Sibal. In a different context, some officials were heard talking about how M. Veerappa Moily had gone overboard with his law and justice ministrys proposals.        
	Sources said the officials point was the ministers had perhaps bitten off more than they could chew in their zeal to outdo each other in flagging off the 100-day initiatives, enshrined in the Presidents address to Parliament.        
	 It is reforms with social inclusion. But on a vital sector like education, we must not say anything that will suggest we are against changes and want the old order to persist, a source said.        
	Rahul (Gandhi) himself has spoken on education reforms. The middle class and the opinion-makers have reacted positively to Sibals suggestions and we must not fritter away the goodwill.        
	Sources claimed the feedback was that Joshis criticism of Sibal had reinforced the perception that the BJP was stuck in the back to basics groove.

          JOHN MARY                          Relatives of victims of the boat tragedy at a hospital in Kerala on Thursday. (PTI)                                  
	Thiruvananthapuram, Oct. 1: Unopened packets of lifejackets lay on the riverbank. A tourist from Britain said the boats driver had suddenly swerved.        
	If only the boat had been made of wood, not fibreglass, the inexperienced skipper rued from his hospital bed.        
	A day after a tourist boat capsized in a lake in a Kerala wildlife sanctuary some 200km from Kochi, drowning dozens, a myriad questions bobbed in the land of enchanting backwaters.        
	The toll rose to 41, including five from Bengal who were identified as Nirmal Kanti Das and his wife Meena, Dipak Kumar Dutta and his wife Kalpana, and Anu Bhandari. Among the dead were nine children.        
	The Kerala government today suspended boating in the Thekkady lake after several survivors blamed lack of safety measures for the tragedy.        
	Chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan announced a judicial inquiry and said the probe would cover all aspects of the accident, including the drivers handling of the vessel.        
	Kerala police chief Jacob Punnose put the toll at 41 but said some guests hadnt returned to hotels in Thekkady town near the Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary where the double-decker, Kerala Tourism Development Corporation (KTDC) boat capsized.        
	Home minister Kodiyeri Balakrishnan said four passengers of the ill-fated Jalakanyaka were still missing.        
	Search operations by naval divers were called off this evening because of intermittent rain.        
	Victor Samuel, the driver, said the passengers had suddenly moved to one side of the boat to see wildlife. If the boat was made of wood, this tragedy might not have occurred. I told the people not to crowd on one side but they didnt listen, he said from his hospital bed, but admitted that he had driven the boat only four times before.        
	Another survivor, Merlin, a tourist from Britain, told a TV channel that the skippers sudden swerve led to the accident. I thought it was all over, Merlin, who was in the lower deck with husband Jack, said.         
	But Jack broke the glass and pulled me out. I kept paddling and soon came to the surface. We kept paddling till the rescue boats arrived.        
	Dinesh Dinakaran, a tourist from Madurai who lost his wife and two children, said the boat didnt have lifejackets.        
	It is quite serious if the crew did not supply lifejackets to the passengers, KTDC chairman Philip said, alluding to the unopened lifejackets piled on the bank near the site of the tragedy.        
	Chief minister Achuthanandan announced Rs 500,000 for relatives of each of the dead who included 15 from Tamil Nadu, 10 from New Delhi, six from Andhra Pradesh, two from Karnataka, and one each from Maharashtra and Haryana.

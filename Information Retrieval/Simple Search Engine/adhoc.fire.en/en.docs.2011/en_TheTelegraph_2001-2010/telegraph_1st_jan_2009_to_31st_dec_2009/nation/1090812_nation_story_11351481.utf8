	Mumbai, Aug. 11: The air-conditioning system in private hospitals has become a stumbling block in Maharashtras efforts to widen the scope of swine flu treatment.        
	The government, which had yesterday asked 19 private hospitals to reply by this evening if they were willing to adhere to World Health Organisation norms, today asked for time to pause and think even as the toll across the country reached 11, seven of them from Maharashtra.         
	They have asked for three days to get back to us. We have told them what portions of the guidelines can be followed and what can be reworked. We will wait for their response, said Pramod Lele, chief executive officer of Hinduja Hospital. Two more private hospitals offered their services today.        
	The biggest hurdle seems to be the central air-conditioning system that most top private hospitals have.        
	The government guidelines require a dedicated air-conditioning plant for the quarantine wards as the virus can travel through the AC system.        
	Also, central government guidelines, drawn up as per WHO recommendations, require a six-foot distance between beds in the isolation ward. Such wards would have to be excluded from the central AC system and must have separate entrances and exits. It is difficult to arrange this in such a short time. We are talking to the government to see how we can accommodate the guidelines, said Kamal Parasram of Lilavati Hospital.        
	Most private hospitals in Mumbai, apart from Prince Aly Khan Hospital, do not have the infrastructure to meet WHO specifications.         
	If they feel after three days that we can meet their standards, we will be doing their screening and testing and they will also hand over to us the screening protocol, said Lele.        
	However, out of compulsion, the government has already allowed some private hospitals to treat patients in critical condition.        
	Sandeep Gaikwad, 28, is being treated at Hiranandani Hospital, though the hospital does not have infrastructure like separate air-conditioning and wards.        
	Sujit Chatterjee, CEO, Hiranandani Hospital, said: Under the existing government rules, the patient had to be moved to Kasturba hospital, but he would not have survived the journey. Hence, the government permitted us to use Tamiflu in this hospital.        
	Two more deaths were reported from the state today. Shruti Gawse, 13, perished at Punes Sassoon Hospital after being on ventilator for four days. Sayeeda Dorjeewala, 63, of Thane district adjacent to Mumbai also succumbed to the virus. Joining the list of cities with casualties was Vadodara where Arya Gorade, a seven-year-old schoolgirl, died.         
	The pandemic has spread to rural areas. After villages adjacent to Pune, five more swine flu cases have been detected in the Akola area of Vidarbha, said Maharashtras additional chief secretary (health), Sharwari Gokhale.        
	With the virus spreading, Mumbai is following health minister Ghulam Nabi Azads advice to stay indoors.         
	A much publicised dance performance by 4,000 students of the Shiamak Davar Academy over the Independence Day weekend has been cancelled, as has Luxurion 2009, a luxury products event. A Nike ManU product launch and Anifest India 2009 (the biggest animation film festival of the country) have also been called off.

	Srinagar, Jan. 18: The Satyam scam has cast a shadow on a Jammu township being built for exiled Kashmiri Pandits with cash from the Prime Ministers Relief Fund.        
	Maytas Infra, a family firm of disgraced Satyam founder B. Ramalinga Raju, is one of the projects developers, along with partner Ritvic Constructions Company.        
	The 100-acre township is coming up at Nagrota on the outskirts of Jammu town. Officials of the Jammu and Kashmir government, which is overseeing the construction, said Maytas and its partner had submitted the lowest bid, of Rs 253 crore, to bag the project.        
	But a company owned by the state government has alleged that it was shut out of the bidding on arbitrary grounds.        
	The project, commissioned in September 2007, is to be completed within 24 months. State relief commissioner Vinod Kaul claimed the Satyam scam and the uncertainty surrounding Maytas had not affected construction. Forty per cent of the work is complete.        
	Other officials said the government was watching the developments unfolding in the aftermath of the fraud. We do not know how it (the scam) will affect the project but if it does, it will hamper the programme to rehabilitate Kashmiri Pandits, an officer said.        
	State chief secretary S.S. Kapoor said tenders for the project had been invited from firms across the country and the selection was done through open bidding. Relief commissioner Kaul said nine companies had been in the fray.        
	But the managing director of J amp;K Projects Construction Corporation, which has alleged discrimination, said the government had violated a rule that gave companies from the state some degree of preference.        
	Our tender was not even opened. We were told our corporation didnt fulfil several requirements, though a state cabinet order says any government project worth over Rs 1 crore should be given to us without inviting tenders as ours is a government corporation, Dileep Thusoo said.        
	Kaul admitted the tender was not opened but suggested the corporation lacked experience. The corporation had failed in the pre-qualification bid where they were required to have done a certain volume of work, which they had not.        
	Since construction began two years ago, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi have visited the township, which will have 4,227 dwelling units in a built-up area of 21 lakh sqft, several times.

	New Delhi, Sept. 18 (PTI): Australia has barred about 200 education agents in several countries, including India, from filing online student visa applications on fraud charges.        
	The Association of Australian Education Representatives in India, an organisation formed to assure the credibility of agents recruiting students for Australian institutions, said these agents will have to show cause for their behaviour to regain access to the online system.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Fed-up Sonia game for Mulayam U-turn
                                                                                                               Fed-up Sonia game for Mulayam U-turn
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              Amar, Mulayam: Use-and-discard jab				                                 
	New Delhi, Feb. 11: The Congress is veering around to a take-it-or-leave-it stand on the Samajwadis even as Amar Singh fired a fresh fusillade at Sonia Gandhis party for adopting a use-and-discard policy towards its allies.        
	Congress sources said Sonia and Rahul Gandhi did not want the party to be blamed for sundering the ties and wanted to maintain a facade of normality till the situation became irretrievable.        
	Digvijay Singh, the general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh, was asked to speak to Amar, which he will probably do tomorrow.        
	But sources said the Congresss baseline was clear: personal issues will not be mixed with political ties. When personal issues override political issues, problems arise, Digvijay said, obliquely referring to the assets case against Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav being heard by the Supreme Court.        
	Government sources said Samajwadi general secretary Amar and Mulayam had been told clearly that the CBI could do nothing more in the case against Mulayam, his sons Akhilesh and Prateek, and Akhileshs wife Dimple.         
	It is up to the court to give the CBI orders and the CBI is duty bound to implement them, a source said.        
	A cabinet minister rued that to fulfil certain alleged assurances to win Samajwadi support for the July trust vote, the law ministry kept getting rapped each time the apex court heard the assets case.        
	We have been slapped on both cheeks, by the court and Amar. But while we have to endure the courts slaps, I see little reason for putting up with those from Amar, the minister said.        
	Congress sources, however, said his brave words might amount to little because the UPA still needed Samajwadi support to see the interim railway and general budgets (or vote-on-account) through during the Parliament session beginning tomorrow.        
	The uncertain Samajwadi-Congress relationship  nobody on either side was using the word alliance anymore  has cast a shadow on the last session of this Lok Sabha.        
	Government managers pondered over what would happen if Mulayam were to pull the plug by voting out the interim budget. The 35 Samajwadi MPs would cushion the UPA against an unexpected blow from the Opposition, but if they were to go, the government would go, too.        
	The Congresss floor strategists were counting on the BJP and the Left to bail out the government if such a crisis arose, sources said.         
	A vote-on-account is a money bill and if it is defeated, the government has to resign. But its implications are more serious because it means the government cannot spend a single paisa from the exchequer after March 31 until a new government comes and passes the budget. We imagine no party will want to subject a government to a crisis of this kind, a source said.        
	BJP sources said they would fully co-operate to pass money bills.

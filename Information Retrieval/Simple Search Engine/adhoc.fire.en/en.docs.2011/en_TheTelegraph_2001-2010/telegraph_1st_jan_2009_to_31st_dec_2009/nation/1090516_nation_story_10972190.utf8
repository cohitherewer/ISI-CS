The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Dirty Dozen for Cong cause
                                                                                                               Dirty Dozen for Cong cause
          ANANYA SENGUPTA IN NEW DELHI                              
	Sherpa fends off shadowy men who offer him bribes to reveal Congress leaders travel plans. Chander Sen Gora thinks nothing of sleeping on the office table every night for two months.        
	These men in the Congress headquarters control room are tough, so its no surprise they call themselves the Dirty Dozen. As in the Hollywood film, they are led by a veteran officer.        
	The names an inside joke, laughs Major (retired) Dalbir Singh. Its because we dont take nonsense from anyone. They dont need to, for even Sonia and Rahul Gandhi cannot move an inch on their campaign trail without the Dozens help.        
	In the film, Lee Marvins band of convicts is sent on a mission to mass-assassinate German officers. Dalbirs team draws up campaign schedules for senior party leaders, co-ordinates with every state unit, executes the mind-boggling logistics  and even protects the campaigners from harassment in Opposition-ruled states.        
	We are responsible for arranging the chopper, then a vehicle to take the campaigner to the meeting, then his or her accommodation. A leader usually addresses four-five meetings a day, and we have to co-ordinate his every move so he is back in time to reach his next series of meetings the following day, says the tall major, claiming he has lost 8kg in the past two months.        
	Dalbir, who has been planning campaign itineraries for the Congress since 1996, provides a glimpse into the jobs scale: each Congress chief minister attended 50-60 meetings in the preceding two weeks; national leaders like Ghulam Nabi Azad and Digvijay Singh at least 50 each; Sonia attended 140 while Rahul attended 225.        
	The Dozen, aged mostly in their 40s and 50s, wore contented expressions on the last day of polling, happy at a job well done. They showed off a letter of appreciation Sonia sent after the 2004 elections.        
	The majors desk is stacked with classified documents about top leaders schedules that he says rival parties are willing to pay for. All 12 claim they were approached one time or the other.        
	I have had to change many drivers: they would be taking money and giving out information they overheard. And there is a risk of them sneaking out papers from here or from their car seats where leaders may have left documents, Dalbir says. But I trust my people. They are like soldiers on a mission.        
	Gora slept in the office every night, taking phone calls at unearthly hours. Any leader facing a problem anywhere in India calls control room, and we make sure the problem is solved, he says.        
	During the 2004 polls, Sushil Shinde called to say an FIR had been registered against him in UP because his chopper had landed in the wrong place, Dalbir said. The district magistrates give us the co-ordinates. Often, in a state run by a rival party, they give us wrong information and our leaders are caught in a mess. Then we have to sort things out  delay, cancel, reschedule meetings. In every election we have four to six such cases of harassment.        
	The Dozen are volunteers, working for modest stipends. Gora gave up his small business in Himachal Pradesh seven years ago to come to Delhi and work for the partys cause.        
	Ex-soldier Sherpa, a war veteran, has been with Dalbir for 15 years. Election campaigns are fun, he says. Politics is an addiction; I cant stay away.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rotten egg attack on Swamy
                                                                                                               Rotten egg attack on Swamy
          G.C. SHEKHAR                              
	Chennai, Feb. 17: A group of pro-LTTE lawyers pelted former Union law minister Subramanian Swamy with rotten eggs inside a courtroom in front of two judges in Madras High Court.        
	The attack occurred this morning when Swamy appeared in the court of Justices P.K. Mishra and K. Chandru to implead himself in a case challenging the government takeover of the Natarajar temple at Chidambaram, 250km from here.         
	As Swamy was arguing his case, around 20 pro-LTTE lawyers barged into the court hall, shouted get out... dubbed him a traitor of Tamils and threw a few rotten eggs at him.        
	Swamy has been persistent in his demand that LTTE leader Prabhakaran be deported to India to stand trial for the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. He enjoys Z category protection because of his outspoken stand on the LTTE.        
	His white kurta soiled and momentarily stunned, Swamy moved closer to the bench as the two judges watched the turn of events shell-shocked.        
	Immediately, other lawyers present in the court formed a protective ring around Swamy who complained to the judges about the assault. The judges asked the government pleader to suggest a course of action but Swamy urged them to take suo motu action since they were witnesses themselves.        
	The judges then passed an order directing the police commissioner to take criminal action against the lawyers.         
	Escorted out of the court premises by a strong contingent of police, Swamy told reporters that the lawyers had accused him of being a Sri Lankan agent as he had not taken up the cause of the Lankan Tamils.        
	I have always distinguished between the genuine rights of the Sri Lankan Tamils and the terrorism of the LTTE. I will not be cowed down by such cowardly acts by a few terrorists in lawyers robes, Swamy said.        
	The assault on Swamy marks another dark chapter in the recent history of Madras High Court which has been held to ransom by a few rowdy elements in the legal fraternity. Last month, when the boycott call given by a section of lawyers on the Lankan Tamils issue was ignored by some who chose to argue their cases

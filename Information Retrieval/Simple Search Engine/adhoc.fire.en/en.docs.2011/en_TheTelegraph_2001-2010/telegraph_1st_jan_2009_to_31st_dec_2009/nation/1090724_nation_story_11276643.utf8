The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Brando snatches political scion
                                                                                                               Brando snatches political scion
          PRATIM D. GUPTA                          Arunoday Singh                                  
	Calcutta, July 23: Gandhi, Pilot, Scindia... but not this Singh.         
	Rahul Gandhi, Varun Gandhi, Sachin Pilot, Jyotiraditya Scindia may have all taken up the family job but the one GeNext political scion who has chosen not to tread the beaten track is Arunoday Singh.         
	The 26-year-old grandson of former Union human resource development minister Arjun Singh has chosen to become an actor. Come August 21 and Arunoday will be seen playing a Kashmiri militant in the film Sikandar.        
	Blame this twist in the tale on Marlon Brando. He watched On the Waterfront when he was just nine and Arunoday knew what he wanted to do when he grew up. That was it. I wanted to be a contender too, he told The Telegraph. After watching Brando in that film, I imagined being able to do to somebody what that man just did to me.        
	Arunoday started doing plays in school and then the hobby turned into a burning desire.         
	I did some courses at the New York Film Academy and then a course with the Acting Studio in New York. Then I acted in a lot of plays  a few off-Broadway productions and some Shakespeare adaptations with The Actors Centre in London. I banged my head on every theatre door  some of them opened, some of them left me bloody. Then I met Sudhir Mishra, the producer of Sikandar, and I got to audition for the film.        
	His family, including Arjun himself, was always cool about it. He never cared one way or the other his only concern was my happiness, Arunoday said nonchalantly.         
	One would assume that a person like him would be a tyrant or at least heavy-handed with his grandson. But he really is the coolest guy. He is a very live and let live kind of a guy. He does not decide what I do and I dont make his policy decisions. I am an actor. I have no politics.        
	The man who has already bagged two more Bollywood films  one with director Vinay Shukla (Godmother) called Mirch and an adaptation of Emma, produced by Anil Kapoor and starring Sonam Kapoor, called Ayesha  is proud to have done it all by himself.         
	I have always been fiercely independent. I have been my own man as far as I can remember, Arunoday said. I dont have any backing in the film industry. My grandfather, despite being who he is, has no pull in the acting circles of Mumbai. Nobodys going to give me roles because I am Arjun Singhs grandson.        
	But Arunoday will surely be noticed in his first few movies for his grandpa.

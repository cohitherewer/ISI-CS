The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bollywood out of IPL final
                                                                                                               Bollywood out of IPL final
          PRATIM D. GUPTA                          Akshay: No show                                  
	Johannesburg, May 21: Exit Bollywood blitz, enter South African singers.        
	The IPL closing ceremony on May 24 will not see Akshay Kumar and Kareena Kapoor perform at the Wanderers, thanks to the revenue-sharing tangle between multiplex owners and Bollywood producers.        
	Akki and Bebo, whose Kambakkht Ishq was to release on May 29, were to do a marketing blitz for the film. But the multiplex impasse has pushed back the release date  it may not hit the screens before mid-June  so the show stands cancelled.        
	Sajid Nadiadwala, the producer Kambakkht Ishq, said from Mumbai: According to the guidelines of the United Producer-Distributor Forum, we cant promote the film or release its music unless the strike is over. So we were left with no option but to skip the IPL performance.        
	In the first IPL last year, Bollywood played a big part in the ceremonies. Sameera Reddy, Dia Mirza, Amrita Arora and Shamita Shetty performed in the opening ceremony and Salman Khan danced on closing night in Mumbai  a promotional boost for his TV debut Dus Ka Dum. Next Sunday, however, local talent will entertain the crowds.         
	Jason Hartman and Sasha-Lee Davids, the winners of this years Idols reality show in South Africa, will belt out popular numbers before the final gets under way. Shilpa Shetty was one of the celebrity guests at the final of Idols, held a couple of weeks ago in Johannesburg.         
	There will also be an old favourite  Guyanese music icon Eddy Grant, who sang the stirring anti-apartheid reggae anthem Gimme hope, Joanna (Joanna stood for Johannesburg). He will perform at the closing ceremony and is expected to turn up with his guitar during the two semi-finals.        
	IPL commissioner Lalit Modi said: Were certain that the crowds packing the stadiums will give Eddy the warmest welcome. And, as his recent tour of South Africa showed, Eddy has a tremendous following in the country. Of course, were also confident that, as a cricket fan, Eddy will enjoy his visits to the game as much as well enjoy his performances!         
	Its not clear if Bollywood would even be present on the stands on the closing day of IPL 2, what with the Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab not to speak of the Kolkata Knight Riders  already out of the tournament.

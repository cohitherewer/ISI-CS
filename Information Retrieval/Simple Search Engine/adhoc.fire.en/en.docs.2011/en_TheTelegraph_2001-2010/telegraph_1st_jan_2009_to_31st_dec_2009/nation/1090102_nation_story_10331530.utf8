                                                                                                               Phased exit of Orissa   riot forces 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                     
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 1: Central paramilitary forces will be taken off riot-scarred Kandhamal in stages from mid-January, Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik said today.        
	Our officials will be in touch with the Union home ministry for a phased withdrawal of the forces, Patnaik said here after reviewing the situation in Kandhamal.        
	The state police chief is in touch with officials in Delhi and will speak to them again tomorrow, Patnaik said, adding that he, too, would take the matter up with Union home minister P. Chidambaram as and when required.        
	The Centre has agreed to keep the forces in Kandhamal till mid-January after requests from the chief minister for an extension. Patnaik had written to Chidambaram on Saturday and spoken to him two days later for the extension.        
	Central paramilitary forces are needed till the return of (the) minority community to their home(s) from relief camps and till the repair/reconstruction of their damaged home(s). This will help in early restoration of normality, Naveen had said in his letter to Chidambaram.        
	Around 3,000 central forces have been deployed in the trouble-torn region since anti-Christian riots broke out last August. They will be replaced by around 3,000 police personnel now being recruited, Patnaik said, adding that the hiring process will be complete by March this year.        
	However, Christian leaders have been demanding that the central forces stay till the Lok Sabha polls and Assembly elections, both likely to be held around the same time this summer.        
	On December 20, a delegation led by the archbishop of the Cuttack-Bhubaneswar diocese, Raphael Cheenath, had urged Patnaik to request the Centre to let him retain the forces longer.        
	In October, Christian leaders had urged a visiting team of central ministers, headed by agriculture minister Sharad Pawar, to deploy the central forces till the elections.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bengal off Maoist action
                                                                                                               Bengal off Maoist action

	New Delhi, Oct. 9: The anti-Maoist offensive in the works will be spread over six districts in all or some of four states and affect 2.5 million people, a number roughly a fifth of Calcuttas population, a senior home ministry official said here today.        
	Convoys of trucks carrying food, relief and reconstruction workers funded by a central corpus of about Rs 7,300 crore will roll in on the heels of the security forces in the affected zone.        
	The official did not identify the districts but said the operations would be spread over two or three of four states ---- Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Orissa and Jharkhand ---- to begin with. Security forces and the state governments would be urged to stick to time-bound targets.        
	The forces will be concentrated in a limited area, secure it and carry out development. It is a holistic plan. We are not going to spread ourselves thin, said Union home secretary G.K. Pillai. There is a level of operations that is already on. This is just a step-up.        
	It is likely that the operations will be stepped up after the Assembly elections of October 13. The conclusion of the electoral process will allow the Centre to re-deploy central forces in the Maoist zones.        
	Although Bengal has not been named in the first phase of the operations, which will be expanded later, the strategy drawn up is based on the Lalgarh model adopted by the state and central forces in West Midnapore district.        
	An official said that about 40 battalions of central forces were already in operation in four states. There would be a fresh induction of troops for the stepped-up operations.        
	The number of security forces involved, or planned for deployment, was not disclosed. Currently, Maharashtra, which is heading into an Assembly election, has about 180 companies of central forces. With redeployment, the total number of troops involved is likely to top 70,000.        
	The action plan has come. We are ready to launch the offensive, CRPF director general A.S. Gill said.        
	When more security forces are available, the operations will be expanded to cover more districts. Forces would not only be freed from duties elsewhere but would be reinforced by freshly trained batches.        
	The CRPF, its special Cobras, Indo Tibetan Border Police and the BSF will be involved along with the state police forces, with helicopter support from the Indian Air Force.        
	The paramilitary forces will have pilot-less aircraft and night-vision devices. The air force is being told that the cordons thrown around helipads will be wide enough to keep the aircraft out of range of small-arms fire. IAF helicopters are most vulnerable when landing or taking off.        
	The home ministry official estimated that it would take about a month after security forces entered their area of responsibility to restore a semblance of civil administration. The local administration would be given between 12 and 18 months for a development surge. The state governments have been asked by the Centre to identify the villages that should be brought within the ambit of the secured areas.        
	Yesterday, the cabinet committee on security had a long discussion on the operations against the Maoists. The contours of the governments strategy are now becoming evident but the schedule and timing are not yet known.        
	A home ministry official said the cabinet had cleared a corpus of Rs 7,300 crore in June for infrastructure development. This fund would now be used to rebuild schools, roads and hospitals and to distribute relief in the affected zone.

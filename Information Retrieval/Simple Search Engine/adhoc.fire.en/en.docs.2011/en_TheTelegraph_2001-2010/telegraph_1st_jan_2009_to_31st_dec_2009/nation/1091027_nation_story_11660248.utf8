                                                                                                               Naveen bats for farmers
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 26: The recent spate of farmers suicides and the following uproar put the Naveen Patnaik government in a tizzy. Now, before the rabi season, the chief minister is pulling out all stops to ensure that such incidents dont occur again.        
	Five farmers committed suicide within a month after allegedly failing to repay loans following crop failure caused by erratic rainfall and pest attacks.         
	The deaths led to an uproar and the ruling BJD was slammed by the opposition and organisations that protested against official apathy, forcing the government to initiate remedial measures.         
	On Saturday, Naveen asked agriculture production commissioner R.N. Senapati to probe into the suicides following which a fact-finding team, headed by former Speaker Kishore Kumar Mohanty, was formed. The team confirmed the suspicion that crop failure and loan burden were the twin causes behind the deaths at Jharsuguda and Sambalpur. The team also criticised the administrations insensitivity.        
	Naveen today reviewed the preparedness of the administrations before the rabi season and directed district collectors to co-ordinate with related departments to ensure that farmers receive credit, fertiliser, seeds and irrigation inputs that could prevent the kharif calamity.         
	A target 31 lakh hectares would be harvested in this season with emphasis on increase in yield.        
	Crop loan to the tune of Rs 1,095 crore will be provided to farmers during the rabi season, said agriculture minister Damodar Rout.         
	The chief minister has asked the energy department officials to start up 22,000 lift-irrigation points.         
	Taladanda and Salandi canals will be repaired as well. Steps will be taken to fill-up vacancies in the agriculture department at the grassroots.

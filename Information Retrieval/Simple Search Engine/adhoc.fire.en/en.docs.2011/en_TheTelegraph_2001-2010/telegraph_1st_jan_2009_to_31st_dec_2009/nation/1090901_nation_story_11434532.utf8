          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Aug. 31: Two children who accidentally locked themselves in a car apparently died of carbon monoxide poisoning as they remained trapped inside unnoticed for over five hours.        
	Three-year-old Rufi and her neighbour Tania, a year older, were found dead in a hatchback owned by Rufis father yesterday afternoon in front of their homes in Azamgarh, 275km east of Lucknow.        
	We suspect the girls may have inhaled gas that was trapped inside the car. The gas would have paralysed them soon, so they would not have had the strength left to scream, said Harsh Srivastava, a police officer in Azamgarh.        
	R.P. Singh, a Varanasi-based automobile engineer, said carbon monoxide, a toxic gas, can accumulate inside a car if its engine is kept running for some time after the car has stopped.        
	The 2005-model car had been running for quite some time till about 8 yesterday morning, less than an hour before Rufi and Tania had climbed in.        
	Some accumulated gas may not have dispersed and as the children entered the car to play and rolled up the windows, they may have inhaled it and got slowly paralysed, Singh said.         
	Senior superintendent of police Ramit Sharma, however, said it was also possible that the children had suffocated to death since they were trapped inside the car for over five hours.        
	Neighbours said they did not hear any noise or shouts from inside the car.        
	Rufis father Naseem Ahmed, who owns a stationery store and an STD booth, has told the police he had gone to Sarai Meer locality, around a kilometre from his home, yesterday morning to meet a cousin. He had left the car parked in front of his house, the vehicles doors shut but not locked.        
	Before leaving home, Ahmed said, he had seen Rufi, the youngest of his four children, and Tania, a neighbours daughter, step out together to play. He had returned home around 11am but didnt notice the absence of the two children.         
	When we started searching for the girls around 2 in the afternoon, we found them lying dead in the car, a distraught Ahmed said.        
	District police chief Sharma said it appeared that the cars doors had somehow got locked from inside and the girls could not open it.         
	They may have inhaled some gas that killed them but we cant say for sure just yet. The investigation is on, he said, adding that suffocation too was a possibility.         
	Automobile engineers, however, said carbon monoxide poisoning was the likeliest cause. An engineer in Lucknow said cars often turned into death traps because of carbon monoxide emission as a result of incomplete combustion in the exhaust.        
	Common sources of carbon monoxide that may lead to poisoning include generators, heaters, petrol-powered tools such as lawn mowers, and welders. Exposure typically occurs when the equipment is used in buildings or semi-enclosed spaces.

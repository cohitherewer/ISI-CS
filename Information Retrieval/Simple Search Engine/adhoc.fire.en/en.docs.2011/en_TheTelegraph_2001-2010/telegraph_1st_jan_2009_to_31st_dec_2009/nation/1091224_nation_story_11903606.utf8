The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Supercop in PC revamp plan
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Supercop in PC revamp plan
  - Chidambaram proposes two-pillar method        NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 23: P. Chidambaram today proposed a new architecture for homeland security that will recast his home ministry, whittle down the powers of the national security adviser (NSA) and give vast authority to a new counter-terror supercop.        
	Chidambaram said his plan rested on two pillars: first, a reform of the ministry itself and, second, the creation of a National Counter Terrorism Centre (NCTC) headed by a serving police or military officer.        
	The time to act is now and I would spell the last word in capitals: N--W, the home minister said to emphasise urgency. He was the guest speaker at the Intelligence Bureau Centenary Endowment Lecture, here.        
	Chidambarams plan proposes to streamline the responsibilities of departments  like the enforcement directorate  that are not even a part of his ministry. He has also suggested that directorates or divisions not relevant to internal security could be moved to other ministries.        
	The NCTC will be constituted by the end of next year. The ministers proposal for a supercop to head it is yet to get the cabinets approval.        
	The head of the NCTC would oversee intelligence, investigation and operations against terrorists of all hues. Chidambaram is confident the umbrella organisation can be constituted without passing a legislation, with changes in the rules of allocation of business among ministries.        
	Chidambaram said he wanted only one person to be accountable, and since the NCTC would be answerable to Parliament, its head would report to the home minister. The head could be a police officer or an army officer.         
	Every conceivable agency that has anything to do with crime and terrorism, including the newly formed National Investigation Agency or the National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO) reporting to the NSA, will be subsumed by the NCTC. Even agencies like the enforcement directorate, which is under the finance ministry, or intelligence outfits under the defence ministry will be overseen by the NCTC.        
	The operations wing of the NCTC will be at the forefront of the anti-terrorist strategy, Chidambaram said. Here, terrorism would mean acts of terror whether by the CPI(Maoist), Islamic jihadis, Hindu fundamentalists or insurgents in the Northeast.        
	It is obvious that the NSAs powers will be substantially reduced because a serving head of any of the security agencies would be appointed head of the NCTC. Asked about the status of the NSA, Chidambaram said like in earlier days when there was an internal security adviser as well as an NSA, the NSA would be more focused on international liasing and information gathering.        
	There are multiple agencies involved in intelligence gathering now. While the Intelligence Bureau reports to the home minister, the Research and Analysis Wing is part of the cabinet secretariat and reports to the Prime Minister. Then there is the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC), the NTRO and Aviation Research Centre, which is staffed by the air force but reports to the NSA who also chairs the National Security Council Secretariat.         
	All this will change. Chidambarams proposal to vest such wide powers in the NCTC has led to speculation that the office of the NSA will be reformed with a former foreign secretary at the helm.        
	Work is under way to set up a National Intelligence Grid (Natgrid) over the next two years that will have a network of 21 databases from which intelligence agencies will be able to access information. Natgrid too will come under the NCTC.        
	Chidambaram gave strong reasons to justify his proposals. His ministry, he said, now performs a number of functions that have no direct relation to internal security. It has a division for freedom fighters but it does not even have a desk for dealing exclusively with forensic science. Is this a functional arrangement to deal with the grave challenges to internal security that we face and that we will face for many more years? I am afraid not, he said.        
	Chidambaram apparently wants a lean and mean ministry that works towards a single focus: internal security.        
	It is after one year in office that I have ventured to outline the new architecture for Indias security. There are two enemies of change. The first is routine. Routine is the enemy of innovation. The second enemy is complacency, he warned.        
	On changes made in the year since the Mumbai attacks, the minister said the capacity to contain and repulse an attack was strengthened but the country still needed to reduce the time taken to respond swiftly and decisively to a terror strike.

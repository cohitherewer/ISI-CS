The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Scam relief for Vijayan
                                                                                                               Scam relief for Vijayan
          OUR BUREAU                          Vijayan: Escape route                                  
	May 2: The Kerala advocate-general has asked the states CPM-led government not to give sanction to the CBI to prosecute party state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan in the Lavalin power scam.        
	C.P. Sudhakara Prasads legal opinion comes a fortnight after Kerala voted in the Lok Sabha polls on April 16, denying the Opposition the chance to pin the CPM down on the issue during the campaign.        
	Prasad, who took three months to give his opinion, said the documents handed to him contained no evidence that Vijayan made financial gains out of the Lavalin deal, as the CBI has alleged.        
	Vijayan had been power minister when the state government had decided on a Rs 390-crore contract to Canadian engineering consultant SNC Lavalin in 1996-98 to modernise three power plants in the state.        
	Prasad said Vijayan had the protection of the law for his bona fide decisions taken as a minister in the best interests of the state. Besides, the agreement was finalised when the Congress-led United Democratic Front was in power  so Vijayan couldnt be singled out, the advocate-general said.         
	The CBI had sought the governors sanction for prosecuting Vijayan since he is a former minister. The agency has accused him of pursuing the deal  which it says caused the state a loss of Rs 86 crore  for personal gain.        
	Prasad said that contrary to the opinion expressed by some people, the CBI could not prosecute Vijayan without the governors sanction. The matter now goes to the state cabinet, which is expected to decide on the recommendation to governor R.S. Gavai at its next meeting on Wednesday.        
	Sources said that in theory, Gavai was not bound by the cabinet advice and could sanction prosecution if convinced that the case was not politically motivated, as the CPM has alleged. However, they added, such a decision would not be easy and would go against convention.        
	Chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan, Vijayans arch-rival, had not joined the rest of the party in defending the secretary. He had stuck to the stand that the law will take its own course.        
	He will have to leave the decision to the cabinet, which decides by consensus. If there is a split, it could give rise to constitutional issues.        
	Opposition leader Oommen Chandy has urged Achuthanandan to let the CBI get to the bottom of the case. Allowing the CBI to prosecute is not tantamount to hanging Vijayan, he said.

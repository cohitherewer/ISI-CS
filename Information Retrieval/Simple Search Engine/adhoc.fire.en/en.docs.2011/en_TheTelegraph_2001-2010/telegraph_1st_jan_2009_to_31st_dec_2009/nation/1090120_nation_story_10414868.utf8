	New Delhi, Jan. 19: Four in the afternoon at upscale, residential Green Park. The scream of a siren. A speeding black Honda Accord swerves into view, immediately followed by a Tata Safari.        
	The SUV rams the Accord from behind, sending it spinning to a halt. Barely before the screech of tyres has ended come the sound of boots and sharp commands. A team of policemen in battle gear has jumped out of the Safari and surrounded the black car, its engine running and headlights blinking.        
	A burst of automatic fire from inside  the Accords four occupants are trapped but defiant. The policemen, crouching on the street, riddle the car with bullets.        
	A south Delhi neighbourhood was jolted out of its winter-afternoon languor today by a gunfight right under its balconies and in front of its gates, with police injuring four people they said were planning to rob a bank.        
	Spotting a one-time opportunity, a resident who gave his name only as Rahul filmed the 10-15 minutes of action on his high-resolution cellphone camera.        
	Rakesh Sharma, walking towards his home, dashed in the opposition direction fearing a Batla House  the Jamianagar building where the police had fought alleged militants in September.        
	Ajit, sipping tea on his balcony, thought it was just crackers going off. Then I saw some men in bulletproof vests firing at a car, and realised it was an encounter.        
	After a few minutes, sudden silence. The police dragged the four men out of the Accord, their clothes soaked in blood, and laid them on the street.        
	All the four alleged robbers  of the Satya Prakash or Satte gang from Uttar Pradesh  are being treated in hospital, deputy commissioner H.G.S. Dhaliwal said. The bulletproof vests ensured that the three policemen who took hits suffered minor injuries.        
	The encounter was preceded by a 2km car chase that started in front of the McDonalds restaurant in South Extension. We had information the gang would come to rob a bank at Green Park and a trap was laid, Dhaliwal said.        
	Nine men came on motorbikes to their South Extension meeting point, climbed into a black Accord and a white Hyundai Santro, and made towards Green Park. The police gave chase.        
	At Green Park, the two cars split, the Accord diving into a lane and the Santro continuing straight with its five occupants. The police, forced into a choice, followed the Accord, being driven by Satte, 30, himself.        
	As the injured were later brought into the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, one of the four was boasting despite his injuries.        
	As I was preparing the machine, a radiologist said, I heard one of them say from behind me, Mere sar pe ek lakh ka inam hai (theres a Rs 1-lakh award on my head).        
	Satte took a bullet in the thigh and Shakeel, 24, one in the chest; Sonu, 27, had his right forearm and a lung pierced; and Nadir, 24, took one in each thigh and a third in the left arm. Satte faces some 25 cases, including robberies and murder attempts.        
	Two hours after the encounter, the Accords key was still in place and its headlights still blinked. Blood clots ran across the seats, and glass shards lay everywhere amid the red stains on the street.        
	The police announced a Rs 25,000 reward for information on the five who escaped in the Santro, DL 2C AD 1144. Late in the night, two persons came to a news channels office claiming they were in the car but were innocent. Nadir and Harpal have been arrested.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Question mark hangs over Kosi relief
                                                                                                               Question mark hangs over Kosi relief
          GAUTAM SARKAR                              
	Supaul (Bihar), Jan. 2: Jivan Yadav, 41, a victim of Kosi floods now staying at a makeshift relief camp at Jadia Middle School under Treveniganj block in Supaul, believes that the worse has just begun.         
	He also believes that his government has let him down and has failed to restore normality in the Kosi belt even after five months.         
	Like Yadav, there are 22 more victims of the Kosi floods living on the school campus, who talking to The Telegraph said that they battle the winter cold every day and fear for the lives of their young and old. No proper food, no proper clothes and living under the open sky  where are the facilities, said a camp resident.         
	Social workers engaged in relief operations apprehend that the flood-hit people of Narpathganj and Treveniganj would die if they were not protected from the winter cold  immediately.        
	According to Ajay Akela, a social worker, more than 1,000 people of Hasanpura, Nanki, Bhattabari, Chunni, Dhakragarh, Mahmadia, Chahhatapur and Jadia of Narpathganj in Supaul and Araria, earlier struggling for food, are now struggling for both food and warmth.         
	Yadav says that the January 1 announcement made by chief minister Nitish Kumar to start the second instalment of relief operation from January 5 does not help the situation either, as earlier materials are yet to arrive at some of the camps.         
	Unless we receive relief items, we cannot laud Nitish Kumars endeavour, he said.         
	Government has so far announced the distribution of the second instalment of relief items among flood victims in Kosi region.         
	According to sources, the government would provide Rs 1,590 to a family for purchasing one quintal of grain, besides Rs 250, along with blankets from the Chief Ministers Flood Relief Fund.         
	Earlier, the state government had requested the Centre to supply food grain in exchange of money, however, that request, allegedly, fell on deaf ears. The Bihar government then proceeded to spent its own funds for the works.        
	Nitish Kumar has also announced financial aids for students in the region  Rs 800 for middle school students, Rs 1,000 for high school ones and Rs 1,200 for a college pupil.         
	But resentment has been building up over the promises, which residents believe have been mostly broken, so far.         
	Districts such as Saharsa and Madhepura on December 30 witnessed demonstrations by victims under the CPM banner. Many sustained injuries in police-victim clash as demonstrators targeted offices of districts magistrates protesting against the step-motherly attitude of the government.         
	Former MP and the wife of Anand Mohan, Lovely Anand has also decided to protest against the lack of relief and is scheduled to hold a rally  Maha Panchyat  on Saharsha college grounds on January 28 where many national-level activists are expected to participate.

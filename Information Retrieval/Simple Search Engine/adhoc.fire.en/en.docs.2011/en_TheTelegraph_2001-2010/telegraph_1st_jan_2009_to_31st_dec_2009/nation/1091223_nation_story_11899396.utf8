	New Delhi, Dec. 22: The police chiefs and chief secretaries of five Maoist-hit states will meet on Thursday to devise anti-rebel strategies.        
	The meeting, to be chaired by home minister P. Chidambaram, will be held a day after election results are declared in Jharkhand, whose officers will be part of the discussions along with that of Bihar, Orissa, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra.         
	Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra are already co-ordinating operations. Bengal will join the offensive after it recruits more personnel and trains its force fully.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Police bloomers let off militant
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Police bloomers let off militant
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 20: A Delhi court has acquitted a suspected militant who had allegedly carried 490gm RDX into the capital, but not necessarily because the judge found him innocent.        
	Nazir Ahmad Khan has been let off because the polices elite anti-terror squad had made an elementary goof-up.        
	The squad had taken permission for prosecution  a matter of detail  from the wrong authority.        
	Nazir, 42, is the second terror suspect to be acquitted this year because of the same police error and, as reported by The Telegraph in August, 38 others are awaiting acquittal on the same ground.        
	All these accused have been charged under the Explosive Substances Act, for which the sanctioning authority is the district magistrate or divisional commissioner. But in every case, the sanction has been obtained from the police commissioner.        
	The mistake probably resulted from the police mixing up two similar-sounding laws: the police commissioner is authorised to sanction prosecution if an accused has been charged under the Explosives Act, but not if he is charged under the Explosive Substances Act.        
	Suspected Hizb-e-Islami militant Nazir, a resident of Poonch in Jammu and Kashmir, had been arrested in Delhi on June 4, 2005.        
	Today, the additional sessions court let the alleged militant off and rapped the police for their lapse.        
	The police had realised their mistake in January this year after another suspected Hizb-e-Islami militant, Ayaz Ahmad Shah, was acquitted because of the same mix-up.        
	The police wanted to apply for a fresh sanction but Nazirs lawyer M.S. Khan pointed out that under the law, the sanction for prosecution had to be taken before the trial and not during it.        
	So even if the police took a fresh sanction later, the trial was invalid, the lawyer said.        
	Terror accused do not, however, get acquitted only because of technical bloomers. Three alleged militants were freed by two courts last month for lack of evidence.        
	On November 12, a lower court had acquitted two Jammu and Kashmir residents, Gulzar Ahmed Ganai and Mohd Amin Hazam. The court had also rapped Delhi police for fabricating the case.         
	Two days earlier, the CBI had failed to get a conviction against Mohammad Ahsan Dar, a man it had touted as a founding member of the Hizb-ul Mujahideen.

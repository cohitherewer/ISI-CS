The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | SC fight for land right 
                                                                                                               SC fight for land right 
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 27: The Supreme Court today agreed to examine if it was time to make property a fundamental right again, three decades after it was downgraded to just a legal right.        
	A Calcutta resident had moved the court objecting to the widespread land acquisition by governments and citing the unrest in Singur and Nandigram.        
	A two-judge bench today issued notices to the Centre on Sanjiv Kumar Agarwals public interest litigation, filed through his NGO, Good Governance India Foundation.        
	When property was a fundamental right under Article 31 of the Constitution, acquisitions were difficult because of greater court scrutiny. Now, citizens whose land has been acquired for any public purpose can do little other than fight for more compensation from the government.        
	Successive governments had tinkered with Article 31 to push through social causes, such as abolition of zamindari and land ceiling laws, till the Janata Party government reduced it to a legal right in 1977.        
	The economic situation, however, has changed since then, the petition argues: governments now acquire the property of the poor and the middle class for multinational companies or to set up special economic zones (SEZs).        
	It is ironic that the very same enactments aimed at ameliorating the poor and the underprivileged are now being used to take away their land to be handed over to the rich, including large corporations, for alleged public purpose and without adequate compensation, the petition says.        
	The NGO argues that Article 31 need not have been wholly deleted  and could not legally be deleted since it was part of the Constitutions basic structure  after Article 31A was enacted to take over surplus land from big landholders. Article 31, it says, would have protected small landholders from illegal acquisition, carried out under new economic policies.        
	Since 1990, the entire process of reversing nationalisation of key industries, etc, has made a mere fetish of Articles 39B and 39C, it says. The two articles enjoin the state to follow the socialist goals of land redistribution and use it for the greater good.        
	The newly formed policy on SEZs has as its goal the taking over of properties of individuals, small peasants and farmers under new-founded ideas that public purposes are best served by private interests (MNCs etc), the NGO says.        
	This has ushered in black money and led to political clashes, the NGO, represented by senior counsel Harish N. Salve, claims.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Vijay Krishna                                  
	Patna, Aug. 20: Vijay Krishna, a senior JD(U) leader and school friend of chief minister Nitish Kumar, was arrested from Faridabad near New Delhi today in connection with the murder of his aide, Satyendra Singh.        
	The JD(U) leaders son, Chanakya, accused of shooting Satyendra in his fathers presence and disposing of the body in the Ganga on May 24, is still absconding.        
	Vijay Krishna  he had defeated Nitish in the Barh Lok Sabha polls in 2004 as an RJD nominee but went on to join the JDU during the last Lok Sabha polls  had been evading arrest for two months.        
	The additional director-general (ADG), police headquarters, Neelmani, said a police team from Patna aided by a special cell of Delhi police raided a Faridabad-based house on a tip-off this morning and arrested the former MP.         
	He was produced before a court after which the Delhi police handed him over to their Bihar counterparts on transit remand. The police team from Patna is now bringing him back here from New Delhi to follow up on investigations in the sensational case.        
	Chanakya was allegedly jealous of Satyendra for enjoying Vijay Krishnas trust. He invariably picked up a quarrel with Satyendra on money matters, a senior police officer dealing with the case revealed.        
	According to witnesses, Chanakya gunned down Satyendra in his Patna-based apartment in his fathers presence. The police found Chanakyas body floating near a ghat five days later. The body had been packed in an iron box and dumped in the river.        
	The police subsequently arrested Umesh Singh, Vijay Krishnas driver who allegedly loaded the body in a car and tossed it in the river. Umesh Singh, during interrogation, spilled the beans, giving a new turn to the investigation.        
	When Nitish Kumar disassociated himself from the case, saying the law would take its course, Vijay Krishna went to Delhi and was living at an unknown place from where the police picked him up today.        
	An influential Bihar politician, Vijay Krishna was also a cabinet minister in the Lalu-Rabri government.         
	He represented the Barh Lok Sabha seat, which lost its existence during the last delimitation.         
	He crossed over to the JDU in April and was tipped to be either state party president or hold an important position in the states ruling party.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Shake a leg and hope for hat-trick
                                                                                                               Shake a leg and hope for hat-trick
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA IN KHAMMAM                                        Renuka campaigns in Khammam.Telegraph picture      
	Renuka Chowdhury is hoping to dance her way to a hat-trick in Khammam.        
	Turned out in a green sari and with a hat to shield her from the sun, the firebrand leader is very visible atop her campaign vehicle  a converted minibus  as she tours Kothagudem in the communist heart of Khammam district.        
	These Left parties are opportunists, they will ditch you the moment they sense trouble, she tells the crowd.         
	Renuka is up against the Telugu Desam bigwig Nama Nageswar Rao, whom she had defeated by a lakh votes in 2004. This time, he is the candidate of the grand alliance of the Desam, Left and the TRS.        
	The Lefts support on paper adds to Nama Nageswars confidence in a district where it has held sway traditionally.         
	But on the ground, the picture is not quite as rosy for the realtor with a prominent section of the Left in Khammam choosing not to work for him, unhappy that the alliance ticket has gone to a non-Left candidate.         
	Renukas tirade against the Left and the Desam gets her claps and whistles.        
	Famous for her tractor rides, for snatching a policemans gun in the early days of her career, a slap to a traffic constable more recently and her tirade against the Mangalore pub attackers, the minister with the acid tongue is a hit with women in her constituency.         
	In her stops in the tribal belt, women welcome her with a dance and Renuka often joins in  Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, too, donned the peacock-feather headgear of the tribals and danced with her when she came to campaign last month.        
	But its not all song and dance, the minister for women and child development talks to her constituency about safe childbirth and the mobile hospitals where would-be mothers can go for the delivery.         
	The adapadachu (daughter) of Khammam  she isnt one, but calls herself that by virtue of belonging to the powerful Kamma constituency that has a presence in the district  is greeted with an aarti in the Dalit segments like Sattupalli and Madhira.        
	Here, she has a different message: that of tolerance, in the context of the bitter fight between the Dalit sub-castes of Mala and Madhira.        
	She gets out of home at 10 every morning, reaching her first campaign stop around noon, and retires late in the night after addressing an average of 10 public rallies and an equal number of small meetings.         
	To industrial workers in the large coal-mining belt, Renuka talks about AIDS. Education  especially the state governments 100 per cent fee reimbursement for the poor in higher education  is her subject of choice in towns. Renuka also hopes that her efforts to put the district on the countrys tourist map will pay off.         
	Nama Nageswar, whos trying his luck for the second time from the party that Renuka had also started out with before switching to the Congress 10 years ago, owns an infrastructure company, Madhucon, and is one of the richer candidates in the fray with declared assets of Rs 173.75 crore.        
	Praja Rajyams Jalagam Hemamalini is also in the contest.         
	Khammam goes to the polls on April 16

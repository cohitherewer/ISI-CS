          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, July 22: The government today indicated that it would introduce a whistleblower policy to help crack down on illegal activities involving the manufacture of medicines.         
	Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad announced in the Rajya Sabha that the whistleblower policy was intended to attract the involvement of the public to provide information about unlawful activities in drug manufacture.         
	Medical experts in India have long been concerned about quality standards of drugs and other issues involving medicines relevant to the health of the public. Random sampling of medicines by drug inspectors has indicated that about 7 per cent of drugs could have quality issues. A number of doctors believe that Indian regulatory authorities have not done enough to ensure drug quality in India.         
	Azad, responding to a debate on the functioning of the health ministry, also said the Union government would introduce a central drug authority bill to improve the regulatory mechanism for drugs in India.         
	Under existing rules, state drug regulators are empowered to provide manufacturing licences to drug companies.                     
	Medical experts believe this has spawned non-uniform manufacturing practices in different states.         
	One of the objectives of the proposed central authority would be to introduce common manufacturing practices across India, a senior health official said.

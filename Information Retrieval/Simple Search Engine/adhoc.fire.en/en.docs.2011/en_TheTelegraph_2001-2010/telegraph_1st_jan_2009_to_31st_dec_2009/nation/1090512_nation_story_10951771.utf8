The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitish niggle in PM mind

  - Singh uneasy after CMs hug amp; handshake with Modi        OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Manmohan Singh and Rahul Gandhi at an election rally in Amritsar on Monday. (PTI)                                        
	Ludhiana, May 11: Manmohan Singh today said doubts on Nitish Kumars secular credentials had arisen in his mind after he saw the Bihar chief minister shake hands with Narendra Modi.        
	Nitish Kumar no doubt professes to be secular. But the doubt did arise in my mind when he shook hands with Narendra Modi, Singh said at a news conference here.        
	Nitish, whose show of solidarity with Modi  including a hug  came at an NDA rally, had earlier barred the Gujarat chief minister from campaigning in Bihar.        
	Singhs criticism, coming a week after Rahul Gandhi said Nitish was among the chief ministers who had shown the intention to work, was not limited to the handshake. He hit out at Nitish for claiming the Centre had not disbursed compensation for Kosi flood victims last year.        
	Whatever Nitish has said is not true. The state did not spend the money that was given to them by the Centre.        
	Asked if the Congress would prefer a tie-up with Lalu Prasad or Nitish, Singh said everything depended on the numbers.        
	 All possibilities and impossibilities will be decided after the results are out.        
	Lalu Prasads RJD had expressed displeasure after the Congress contested separately in Bihar, but Singh suggested that such perceived rifts in the UPA could be healed.        
	 Politics is the art of the possible. Those who got annoyed can be mollified.        
	Singh said all secular parties had an obligation to form a purposeful government to prevent the NDA from coming to power, a comment that was seen as an attempt to win Left support.        
	Asked if the Congress would support a Left-led government, Singh said such a situation was not likely to arise as the Congress would emerge the single largest party.        
	Singh said the Congress had decided its Prime Minister candidate, which would not be changed even if the Left made it a condition for support. There is no question of any compromise.        
	He merely termed Sharad Pawar a valuable colleague when asked a question on the Nationalist Congress Party projecting Pawar as Prime Minister candidate.        
	 Both parties are fighting the polls together. The rest is mere speculation which the media loves, he said.        
	Appealing to the people to vote a secular combination to power, Singh said the UPAs record had proved it was a government of the aam aadmi.        
	Narendra Modis language and tone yesterday is an indication of the type of government the BJP will lead at the Centre, he said.        
	Singh said the country needed a strong UPA government to ensure rapid growth and tide over recession. Taking a dig at the third front, he said: The third front has slipped even before it has learnt to walk.        
	On the BJP, his take was: The BJP has no answer to the various challenges facing the country. It has only practised negative policies. It is only the UPA that can provide a stable government. Let the results come and we will see who forms the government.        
	Singh said it was not up to L.K. Advani to judge whether he was a weak or a strong Prime Minister.         
	Whether I am weak or strong will be judged by my performance. The steady growth rate in all spheres as well as the nuclear deal have raised the prestige of the country. Advani should think about these things also.        
	He conceded that regional parties are a reality and they need to be given their space.        
	Asked if Singh would be King again, he said: We will have to wait till May 16.

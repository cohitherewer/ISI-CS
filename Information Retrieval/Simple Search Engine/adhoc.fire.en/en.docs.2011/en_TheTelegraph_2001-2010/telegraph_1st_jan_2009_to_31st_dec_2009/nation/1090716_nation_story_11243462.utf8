                                                                                                               Sympathy but no Modi quiz 
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 15: The Supreme Court today sympathised with the father of slain Gujarat BJP leader Haren Pandya but refused to accept his plea and order the interrogation of Narendra Modi over the 2003 murder.        
	A bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan patiently heard Vithalbhai Pandyas arguments during which he alleged the Gujarat chief minister was behind his sons murder.        
	But the judges told him they couldnt order such a questioning by the CBI, which investigated the case, if there were no connecting links to make that kind of assumption (that Modi had plotted the assassination).        
	Assuming there was a feud, (between Pandya and Modi), could it be adequate motive? Unless there is a conspiracy or facts leading up to a conspiracy, can we direct interrogation on the basis of an assumption? the Chief Justice asked.        
	Initially arguing his own case, the septuagenarian Vithalbhai said his son, a former Gujarat home minister, had deposed before the Iyer Commission looking into the riots of 2002. Pandya is believed to have blamed Modi and other ministers.         
	My son was slain by the CM, Vithalbhai said as he opened his argument.         
	There was a hushed silence in the otherwise noisy courtroom as he spoke.        
	Vithalbhai alleged that key witnesses, like his daughter-in-law Jagriti, and he himself were not examined.        
	She was not examined after she alleged that her husbands murder was a political conspiracy, Vithalbhai said. My sons personal assistant was also not examined. Neither was I.        
	At this point, Balakrishnan intervened to say the CBI has investigated the case, apparently without the states control.        
	Vithalbhai contested this saying: All this happened at the instance of the CM.         
	To this, Balakrishnan said: That is a fathers feelings. But there are so many political speculations. Could it be adequate motive?

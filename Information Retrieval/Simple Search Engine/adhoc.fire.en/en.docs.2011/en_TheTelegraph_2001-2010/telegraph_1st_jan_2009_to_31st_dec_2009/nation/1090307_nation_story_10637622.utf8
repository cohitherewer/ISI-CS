The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | JNU strike called off
                                                                                                               JNU strike called off
                            
	New Delhi, March 6: Jawaharlal Nehru University students have withdrawn a hunger strike to protest a hike in admission fees and the rustication of five students but the campus continues to simmer, says our special correspondent.        
	Nine students on hunger strike since February 26 called it off late yesterday after the JNU Teachers Association mediated.         
	The vice-chancellor set up a five-member committee of faculty members to review the decision to rusticate the students who had allegedly attempted to stall the admission process. But meetings of the committee failed to decide whether to uphold the order or to recommend reversing it.         
	The teachers association was to have met today to decide if it should join the protest against the administration, which it said had promised to take back the students if the strike was called off, but had not done so.

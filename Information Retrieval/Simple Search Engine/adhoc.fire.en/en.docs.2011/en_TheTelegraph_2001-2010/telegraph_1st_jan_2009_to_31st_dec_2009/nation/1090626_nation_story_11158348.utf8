	Gaya, June 25: A mother burnt her three minor daughters and then killed herself in Bagohar village under Fatehpur police station on Wednesday evening.         
	According to a delayed report that reached the district head quarters today evening, Rinku Devi, 35, poured kereosene on herself and her three daughters aged between four and eight years. The woman was a migrant worker.        
	Her husband was a migrant worker as well who had migrated to Bengal in search of employment, like hundreds of other fellow villagers in the Fatehpur block, a drought-prone zone of the district. Rinku resorted to the drastic step due to abject poverty.         
	When contacted, Gaya superintendent of police confirmed the incident and added that no specific reason had been established and a case of unnatural death has been registered in this connection. However, the Gaya SP did not rule out poverty, as the cause of the multiple suicide.

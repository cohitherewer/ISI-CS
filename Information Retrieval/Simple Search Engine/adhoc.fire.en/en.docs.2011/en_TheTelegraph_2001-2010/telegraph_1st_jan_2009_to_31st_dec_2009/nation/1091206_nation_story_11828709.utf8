          OUR CORRESPONDENT                      Rajkhowa at the Guwahati court. Eastern Projections                                
	Guwahati, Dec. 5: The Assam government has requested the Centre to devise a mechanism to incorporate the word sovereignty on the agenda for the proposed talks with Ulfa.        
	The suggestion is part of a discreet attempt to get around a hurdle posed by the insistence of the Ulfa leadership that talks could not be held unless sovereignty figured on the agenda.         
	Sources said the government was of the view that there was no harm in having sovereignty in some form on the agenda as the Naga talks, too, had started in a similar manner 13 years ago.        
	In the meantime, we hope to convince Ulfa leaders how unreasonable their demand for a sovereign Asom is, a source in Guwahati said.        
	The Centre is working on a greater autonomy package for the NSCN(I-M) though the outfit has not dropped its sovereignty demand, at least publicly. There are technical problems in including sovereignty but discussing it does not mean granting it. During the talks, we hope to convince Ulfa leaders that sovereignty is not possible and then offer them the next best answer, a source said.        
	The suggestion comes at a time a section of central officials feel that inclusion of sovereignty would go against the Constitution.        
	But the sources in Assam pointed out that when the Naga talks got under way, the operative expression was unconditional talks which meant that both sides went ahead with all the issues raised by the outfit and even the objections by the government.        
	The sources said that even after the Naga talks had started and the outfits leaders had arrived in Nagaland from abroad, they had publicly brandished their version of Nagalim by writing on the base of their miniature flags sovereignty is inalienable.        
	The source said that after the Naga outfit raised the pitch for integration of all Naga-inhabited areas, the issue of sovereignty had got diluted in a natural manner.        
	Negotiator        
	Former Intelligence Bureau chief P.C. Haldar is expected to be the key negotiator with Ulfa chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa.        
	Sources said Haldar had played an instrumental role in the three-month exercise by the Centre to get wanted militants from Bangladesh. Anup Chetia, understood to be in a Bangladeshi jail, is likely to be handed over soon by Dhaka.        
	 Haldar, a 1970-batch Bihar cadre officer, is already an interlocutor for talks with some other Northeast groups.

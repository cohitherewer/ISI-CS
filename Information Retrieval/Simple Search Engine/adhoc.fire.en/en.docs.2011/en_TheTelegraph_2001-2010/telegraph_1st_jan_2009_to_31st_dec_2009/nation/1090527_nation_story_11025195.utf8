          JAYANTH JACOB                               Achuthanandan, Vijayan: Personal war?				                                 
	New Delhi, May 26: Factionalism seems to be overtaking the analysis of what went wrong in Kerala as the CPM gets down to doing a post-mortem of its drubbing in the state in the Lok Sabha elections.         
	The CPM-led Left Democratic Front won four seats out of 20 this time, against the 19 it won in 2004.         
	Discussions at the two-day state secretariat of the party ended in Thiruvananthapuram yesterday, and the state committee meeting to discuss the debacle started today.         
	In his report to the state secretariat, CPM secretary Pinarayi Vijayan came out against chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan. He said the stand Achuthanandan took on issues that differed from the partys created problems, leading to the defeat.         
	The chief minister had refused to toe the party line that corruption charges against Vijayan in the SNC Lavalin case were politically motivated. He was also not keen on an electoral understanding with the PDP, which Vijayan had gone ahead with despite opposition from allies like the CPI.         
	Achuthanandan, who is a sort of a loner in the state secretariat packed with Vijayan loyalists, maintained that the party was seen as supporting corruption in the Lavalin case and this hurt its image. The chief minister, sources said, argued that Vijayan should have proved his innocence through the judicial process.         
	He also blamed the alliance with the PDP for the erosion in minority votes, and said the party leaderships  in other words, Vijayans  statements against bishops led to Christians voting against the party.         
	Although CPM general secretary Prakash Karat, who attended the meeting, said party issues and the analysis of the election defeat should not be mixed, the discussions were along factional lines.         
	Sources said Karat pointed to the lack of Left unity in the state. The sources said Karat also named the understanding with the PDP and the playing out of the Lavalin case among the factors that went against the party.         
	Before the elections, there was infighting in the CPM-led Left Democratic Front, which saw the JD(S) quit the alliance and the CPI lock horns with the CPM.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | High court judge reveals assets
                                                                                                               High court judge reveals assets
                            
	Bangalore, Aug. 25 (PTI): A Karnataka High Court judge who had taken on the Chief Justice of India on the issue of judges assets being made public has gone ahead and disclosed his own assets.        
	Justice D.V. Shylendra Kumar had earlier said that Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, who has been resisting calls for judges assets statements to be put in the public domain, could not speak on behalf of the entire judiciary. This had prompted the CJI to allege that the high court judge was hunting for publicity.        
	Yesterday, Justice Kumar sent a statement on his assets and liabilities to the high court registrar-general with the remark that it could be made public, court sources said today.        
	The issue has divided the judiciary while uniting politicians in stalling a bill that sought to prevent judges assets statements from being published.        
	Justice Kumar had said in a recent newspaper article that the CJI was not authorised to speak for all judges on the subject, and that it was a mistaken idea that judges were not ready to reveal their assets.        
	The CJI, however, said yesterday that high court judges were free to declare their assets.         
	He said he was working towards a consensus in the Supreme Court on disclosure of its judges assets.        
	Every high court judge has the freedom to declare assets. No problem on this, he had said.        
	A couple of days ago, Justice K. Kannan of Punjab and Haryana High Court had made public the list of his properties and called for an in-house mechanism to regulate the judiciarys conduct. He, however, had made it clear he was not looking for a confrontation with the CJI.

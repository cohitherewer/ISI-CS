          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Shiney comes out of the Mumbai court supported by policemen. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, Sept. 25: A court today deferred the framing of charges against actor Shiney Ahuja, arrested for allegedly raping his maid, after he limped into the courtroom wincing in pain and was seen weeping.        
	His lawyer Sameer Nagre told the court that Ahuja had a history of a slipped disc and had suffered a relapse, and moved an application for him to be admitted to JJ Hospital.        
	The additional sessions judge directed the prison medical officer to assess the actors condition and take appropriate action, and deferred the process of framing of charges to October 7.        
	Ahuja was still in jail tonight, his lawyer said. The 36-year-old actor, in custody since June 15, had arrived at the court leaning on two constables. He was doubled up in pain and seemed unable to sit, and tears rolled down his eyes. The constables helped him lie down on a bench. His wife Anupama and parents were present in court.        
	Ahuja has moved Bombay High Court for bail after the sessions court twice rejected his bail plea.

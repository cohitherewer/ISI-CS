The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mulayam dynasty rule

  - SP leader fields seventh family member for bypoll        NISHIT DHOLABHAI AND TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                          Mulayams daughter-in-law Dimple                                         
	New Delhi/Lucknow, Sept. 3: Mulayam Singh Yadav has fielded daughter-in-law Dimple in a Lok Sabha bypoll, making her the seventh family member in the Samajwadi Party hierarchy and setting off murmurs of dynasty rule among some disgruntled functionaries.        
	Dimple Yadav will contest from Firozabad, which fell vacant after her husband Akhilesh chose to retain Kannauj, the other seat he won in the last general election.        
	Party general secretary Ram Gopal Yadav announced the decision yesterday, setting at rest speculation that Lok Janshakti Party president Ram Vilas Paswan could be offered the seat. On this, Ram Gopal said: Alliances are made to be broken. Asked if Dimple had already become a party member, he replied: The whole family is a life member.        
	Sources said many party officials and workers had wanted senior leader Ramji Lal Suman fielded from the seat. The decision will demoralise party workers. Many may stay away from the campaign, said Parmeshwar Yadav, a party leader in Firozabad.        
	When the Bahujan Samaj Party leaders say the Samajwadi Party has become a Pariwarwadi (dynastic) Party, we now feel defenceless, a former Samajwadi MP said.        
	Members of the Yadav family in the party now include Mulayam himself, son Akhilesh, Dimple, leader of the state Opposition Shivpal Singh Yadav (Mulayams brother), Ram Gopal (cousin), MP and youth wing leader Dharmendra Yadav (nephew) and Etawah zilla parishad chief Premlata Yadav (sister-in-law).        
	Some party insiders grumbled that many senior leaders had been superseded to make Akhilesh the state party secretary.        
	Asked about family rule, Ram Gopal said that even the son of Zhou Enlai (the first Premier of communist China) was now in Chinese politics. He added that no party in India was completely free of dynastic politics.        
	Sources said the Samajwadis had done a survey in Firozabad and found that Paswan had a very slim chance of winning. Dimple, however, will face stiff competition from Congress candidate and actor Raj Babbar, a former Samajwadi leader and a local man, who may take away a slice of the Samajwadis Muslim vote.        
	Mulayams relatives feel Dimple would attract votes from both Yadavs and Thakurs, her own caste. She has higher chances of winning from the constituency than any other, Shivpal said.        
	One Samajwadi leader said: The party is already reeling from the impact of the induction of former BJP chief minister Kalyan Singh as an ally, a decision that was taken apparently to ensure the election victory of Mulayams nephew Dharmendra in western Uttar Pradesh. This (picking Dimple) will make things worse.

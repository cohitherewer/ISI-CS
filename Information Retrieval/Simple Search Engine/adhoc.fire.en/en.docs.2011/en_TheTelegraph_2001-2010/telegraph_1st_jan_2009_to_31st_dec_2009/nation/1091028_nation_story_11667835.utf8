The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sanghs poison break from tradition
                                                                                                               Sanghs poison break from tradition
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Bhagwat                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 27: When Mohanrao Bhagwat sets foot inside the Parliament complex tomorrow, he will do something no RSS chief has done  step into the seat of what one of his predecessors had called poison.        
	The poison called democracy.        
	When Bhagwat takes the stage in Parliaments library building, it will be to release a book, India Battles to Win. But no BJP leader will be on the dais, said Tarun Vijay, the author and a former editor of Sangh mouthpiece Panchajanya.        
	Vijay wouldnt say why, but a source said the idea is to shed the Jinnah baggage of the recent past. As long as the BJP doesnt do it, the Sangh would want to distance itself from the party.        
	The mild barb reflects the Sanghs increasing impatience with L.K. Advanis move to hang on to the post of leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha despite a clear message from Bhagwat to the BJP to bring in a generational change.         
	On his part, Bhagwat, too, will be making a break with tradition that has made former chiefs of his organisation keep off Parliament.        
	The RSS, banned at least twice, has always been tentative and, at times, been opposed to parliamentary democracy although it floated the Jan Sangh to articulate its views through a political and parliamentary forum and acquire some respectability among opinion-moulders.        
	Having forayed into politics indirectly, it kept up the facade of being a non-political cultural organisation.        
	M.S. Golwalkar, the second sarsanghchalak, had warned that democracy would poison the peace and tranquillity of the human mind and said politics was a small segment of national life not enough to infuse patriotism.        
	When the NDA was in power and had set up a commission to review the working of the Constitution, K.S. Sudarshan, Bhagwats immediate predecessor, said the panel should examine if parliamentary democracy had benefited India and whether it was time to change it.        
	Even the BJP didnt dare invite any of the RSS leaders to Parliament for any event though senior party ministers participated in Sangh events.        
	Nobody, however, could tell if Advani  whose public appearances have become markedly fewer would show up at tomorrows programme or for that matter at the other events that Bhagwat will preside over during his three-day Delhi sojourn.        
	On Thursday, the RSS chief will address his first public meeting on the Ram Lila ground and on Friday, he will flag off a Maha Sangam (great meeting) of the Ekal Vidyalayas that operate in 27,000 villages and have over eight lakh students mainly in Maoist strongholds.        
	For a party faced with its second most serious leadership crisis after 1980, when the Jan Sangh came into being without the original stalwarts barring Atal Bihari Vajpayee (Advani wasnt counted as one then), Bhagwat, sources said, was the only beacon of hope.        
	Asked today in Jaipur what the BJP required surgery, chemotherapy or medicine  he replied: It has to be diagnosed by them. If they need any organisational help, if they ask for it, we will provide them.        
	In other words, if the BJP wanted more pracharaks (propagandists), the Sangh would loan them.        
	RSS and BJP sources claimed Bhagwat would reveal his hand only after Advani quits. Nobody knows when that will happen.        
	Which is why November 8 is an important date on the BJP-RSS calendar. Advani turns 82 on that day and the camp led by BJP chief Rajnath Singh believe he might announce his wish to resign on his birthday.        
	 But even this camp does not think it would be a firm announcement.

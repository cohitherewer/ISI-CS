          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, March 31: George Fernandes, who was denied a JD(U) ticket on health grounds, today declared that he would contest the polls. He then proceeded to Muzaffarpur, his Lok Sabha seat, 60km from Patna.         
	Incidentally, JD(U) president and Madhepura candidate Sharad Yadav suffered from chest pain and left for New Delhi. Chief minister Nitish Kumar hurriedly called on him at a local hotel here and arranged the latters departure for the check up.         
	I will contest the Muzaffapur seat, but not as an Independent candidate, Fernandes told reporters. In the process, the veteran who had won the Muzaffapur seat in the 2004, left people guessing about the party that would field him.         
	Nitish has repeatedly advised Fernandes not to contest the polls as well-wishers do not want him to undergo the rigours of the campaign.        
	The JD(U) has also declared Jainarayan Nishad as partys candidate on Muzaffarpur seat.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Karuna concedes Eelam not possible
                                                                                                               Karuna concedes Eelam not possible
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chennai, July 1: M. Karunanidhi today said an independent Tamil Eelam (homeland) was no longer achievable in Sri Lanka, marking a major shift in the DMKs stand on the demand following the LTTEs defeat.        
	We can now only fight for equal rights and autonomy for Tamils there, the chief minister said during a special discussion in the Assembly on Lankan Tamils.        
	Karunanidhi recalled how the DMK had given up its separate Dravida Nadu demand following a central move in the 1960s to outlaw separatist movements. Instead, the party worked with understanding governments at the Centre to secure greater autonomy for states and classical language status for Tamil, he said.        
	We can only raise our voice for equal rights and autonomy for Tamils and devolution of powers.         
	The chief minister cautioned Opposition MLAs, who wanted Lanka President Mahinda Rajapaksa to be hauled before the International Criminal Court for alleged rights violations during the recent civil war. He said such statements would further infuriate the Sinhalese  Lankas majority community to which the President belongs  to the detriment of the suffering Tamils.

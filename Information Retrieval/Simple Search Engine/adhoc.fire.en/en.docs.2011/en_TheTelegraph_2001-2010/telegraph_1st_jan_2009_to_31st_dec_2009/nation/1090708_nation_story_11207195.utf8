          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Biju Janata Dal activists block the main entrance of Bhubaneswar railway station on Tuesday (Sanjib Mukherjee)                                  
	Bhubaneswar, July 7: Protesting against the meagre budgetary allocation for the states railways sector, Biju Yuva Janata Dal (BYJD) today observed a state-wide rail roko andolan.        
	Criticising railways minister Mamata Banerjee for her indifference towards Orissa, the youth wing of the party held a two-hour rail roko at stations affecting train services.         
	The railways receive over Rs 5,000 crore in terms of revenue from Orissa, but gives little in return, charged BJD general secretary Narendra Swain.        
	Protests began at 10.00am and continued till 12 noon. In Bhubaneswar, demonstrators squatted on the tracks and raised slogans against the railway budget.         
	Prominent BJD leaders including Ashok Panda, Bhagirathi Badajena, Samir Das, Arvinda Dhali, Arun Sahoo took part in the demonstrations in Bhubaneswar.        
	In Berhampur, district president Subash Moharana, chairperson of Ganjam Zilla Parishad Dharanidhar Behera and district president of the youth BJD Kailash Rana, protested against the railways budget.        
	Rail roko was also observed in major stations including Cuttack, Bhadrak, Balasore, Berhampur, Sambalpur and Khurda Road.         
	Trains were held up by BJD workers at Balugaon, Khurda Road, Berhampur and Jharsuguda.         
	Mamatas indifference is evident from the fact that Rail Vikash Nigam Limited (RVNL) has allocated projects to Project Implementation Units of Calcutta and Bilaspur, but none to East Coast Railway, said a worker.

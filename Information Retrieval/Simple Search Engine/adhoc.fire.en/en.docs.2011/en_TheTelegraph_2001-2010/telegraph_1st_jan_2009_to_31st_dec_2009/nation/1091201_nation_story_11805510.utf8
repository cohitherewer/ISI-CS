  - Sets gifted in TN populist scheme sold and smuggled         G.C. SHEKHAR                          File picture of a Chennai family posing with the free TV it had received and its own 29-inch TV                                        
	Chennai, Nov. 30: Many Tamil Nadu homes have benefited from the DMK governments free colour TV scheme, but so have hundreds of families in Andhra Pradesh and Kerala.        
	They have bought these TVs being smuggled out of Tamil Nadu at Rs 3,000 or even less.        
	The arrest of a lorry driver and the discovery of 17 colour TV sets hidden in his cabin today underlined how the scheme was being misused, police said.        
	A free colour TV to homes without television was the centrepiece of the DMKs election promise in 2006, and had propelled the party to power. But when officials came for enumeration, even those with TVs hid them and became beneficiaries of the scheme.        
	This morning, the police stopped a milk tanker returning to Andhra after delivering a load to a private dairy in north Chennai. The cops found bundles of old clothes in the drivers cabin. Growing suspicious, they untied the bundles to discover in each a 14-inch TV distributed under the free colour TV scheme.        
	According to the police, this is what the driver, Sivakumar, has confessed:        
	He bought the sets for Rs 1,500 each from scheme beneficiaries and planned to sell them for Rs 3,000 in villages in Andhra. People here are ready to sell these government TVs because they already own a bigger colour TV, he said.        
	Sivakumar said he would normally scout those areas where the free TVs had been distributed recently and approach each household with the offer.        
	At least 30 per cent of them readily gave away these sets. I normally smuggle a maximum of three sets but this time I decided to take all the 17 I had bought as I could not get a safe place to store them, he said.        
	Ever since the DMK government rolled out the free TV scheme, the sets have found a ready buyers market in Andhra and Kerala where poor villagers find the low price attractive.        
	The DMK government had tried to scare off prospective smugglers by threatening to get them arrested under the Goondas Act, which would keep them in jail for a year.        
	When you offer something like free TVs or rice at Re 1 a kilo, they will definitely find a readymade black market, a police officer said.        
	As the process to determine which family had a TV and which did not grew difficult, the DMK government had announced that every ration card-holder would get a free TV.        
	Over 85 lakh free colour TVs have been distributed so far, and another 40 lakh have been ordered. The scheme has so far cost the exchequer Rs 2,037 crore out of the proposed Rs 2,500 crore.

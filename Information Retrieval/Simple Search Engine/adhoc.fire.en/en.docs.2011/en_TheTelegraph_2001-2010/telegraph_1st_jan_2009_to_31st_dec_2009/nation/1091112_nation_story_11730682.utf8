	Srinagar, Nov. 11: Hurriyat hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani today urged Muslims not to sing the national anthem, saying it was un-Islamic.        
	His appeal comes even as the dust over the Deobands move last week to renew its fatwa against the national song, Vande Mataram, is yet to settle.         
	Jana Gana Mana is against the beliefs of all of us. It is un-Islamic and should not be recited. Everybody should boycott the function where it is recited, Geelani told students at Kashmir University. Ayaz Akbar, spokesperson for the Geelani-led Hurriyat faction, echoed his leader. It is our stand that it is un-Islamic. Monotheism is the basic tenet of Islam and Jana Gana Mana violates it, just like Vande Mataram does, he said.

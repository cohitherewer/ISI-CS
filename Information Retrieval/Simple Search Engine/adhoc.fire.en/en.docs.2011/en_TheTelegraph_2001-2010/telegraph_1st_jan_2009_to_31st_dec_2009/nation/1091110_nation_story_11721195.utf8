          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 9: Kapil Sibal has indicated his displeasure at the controversial candidature of recently retired higher education secretary R.P. Agrawal for a vice-chancellors post.         
	The human resource development minister is learnt to have communicated his uneasiness with a panels recommendation listing Agrawal with two others for the post of VC of the National University of Educational Planning and Administration.         
	The President  as Visitor to all central universities  has the ultimate power to decide VCs from names shortlisted by the search-cum-selection panel.         
	But the Visitor usually accepts the ministrys recommendation - and Agrawal is now almost certain not to be picked to the post of VC, sources said.         
	Agrawal controversially applied for the post of VC at the central university when he was still the higher education secretary  and in a position to possibly influence the decision of the committee.         
	The search panel even submitted its nominations days before Agrawal retired from the post of secretary on October 31. The list of nominees was headed by Agrawal.         
	The HRD minister, sources said, is keen to avoid any charges of impropriety that may arise if Agrawal is appointed VC at the university  the countrys apex university dedicated to educational research.         
	Agrawal is learnt to have also applied for the membership of the Union Public Service Commission.

	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 13: The State Commission for Women (SCW) today ordered a DNA test to determine the father of Sanjita Dhali, 23, who has been claiming to be BJD MLA Arabinda Dhalis daughter.        
	The test will be conducted on Dhali, Sanjita and Kamala Baral, Dhalis first wife and Sanjitas mother. The order was issued in response to a PIL filed by Sanjita on Monday.         
	The SCW has asked the police commissioner to conduct the test, said Usha Padhi, the commissions acting chairperson. The commission will bear the expenses, Sanjita added.         
	The only way to prove my daughters claim is a DNA test, said Kamala, adding that she would continue to fight for justice.

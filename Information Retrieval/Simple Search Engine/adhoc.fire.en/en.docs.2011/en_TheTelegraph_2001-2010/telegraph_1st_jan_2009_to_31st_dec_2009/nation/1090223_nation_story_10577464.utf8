The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Unfair ads make Anbumani angry
                                                                                                               Unfair ads make Anbumani angry
          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 22: Fair is fine, but the promise is foul.        
	Anbumani Ramadoss isnt amused at all. To be fair, you cant really fault him: he has vowed to skim the hyperbole off fairness cream ads that promise the world to light skin-obsessed Indians.        
	The health minister says advertisements that promise to make one fairer within weeks are misleading and has written to the information and broadcasting ministry for action against campaigns that make such claims.         
	Ramadoss, who has already targeted smoking, alcohol and fast food, has demanded that manufacturers of fairness creams, which account for more than half the $320 million spent on skin-care products every year, be asked to provide scientific evidence for their claims.        
	This needs to stop. They cannot say within one week you will be white and all this.        
	The letter seems to have stirred the information and broadcasting ministry into action.         
	Sources said the ministry, along with the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI), a self-regulatory body of advertisers, ad agencies, media and associated professionals, was planning to crack the whip on erring advertisers.        
	The concerns raised by the health minister are genuine. There are so many ads, both in print and TV, which could mislead the consumer. We are in touch with various bodies, including the ASCI, to bring out a procedural code to make advertisers more accountable, a ministry official told The Telegraph.        
	The ministry, the sources said, was planning to reactivate the Advertisement Standards Regulatory Commissions at both the national and state levels to act as watchdogs.        
	The ministry is also thinking of coming out with a campaign to encourage viewers to send their grievances to these commissions if they find any ad offensive.        
	If an ad is misleading, its our duty to set it right, the ministry official said.        
	The government already has a code for self-regulation in advertising that clearly defines the dos and donts for the industry.        
	But it does have loopholes that need to be plugged, the I amp;B official added.        
	The ministry is planning to set up an inter-ministerial committee with the ministry of consumer affairs to fine-tune the code.        
	The health minister is not the only one who has a problem with fairness cream ads. Apparently, some buyers, too, have complained after realising that they had been creamed off their money but their skin hadnt turned lighter.        
	We are being flooded with complaints regarding the deceptive nature of various ads, especially those relating to fairness creams, the official said.        
	The I amp;B ministry also plans campaigns to increase public confidence in advertising. We will urge consumers to officially complain if they find any advertisement dishonest or misleading, the official said, adding that the common man needs to be taught how to approach the problem.        
	Advertisers might cry foul, but it seems fair enough. Gives a new complexion to the subject.

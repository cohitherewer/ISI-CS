          OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES                          Khursheed: Beaten                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 19: Congress leader Salman Khursheed has been defeated by a man he accused of BJP links in the election for the top post of the countrys leading Islamic cultural and research institution.        
	Sirajuddin Qureshi retained his presidentship of the India Islamic Cultural Centre yesterday, winning by 499 votes in an election charged by allegations of communalism and politicisation.        
	Among the centres objectives are creating an atmosphere of unity and brotherhood and removing misconceptions about the teachings of Islam.         
	Qureshis camp bagged all four executive committee seats and six of the seven seats on the board of trustees of the centre, which has 2,200 members, including the whos who of the countrys Muslim leaders and scholars.        
	Khursheeds camp had highlighted Qureshis BJP connections while the incumbent panel accused the Congress leader of communalising and politicising the election to boost his standing in his party.         
	The Khursheed camp had alleged Qureshi was backed by people in the BJP and targeted him for his visits to Israel and playing host to rabbis.         
	Qureshi had responded to the allegations by saying he merely had friendly relations with BJP members: I am a neutral person. My relations are friendly and not political.         
	Khursheed said candidates should be candid about their connections and denied he was trying to gain mileage ahead of the Lok Sabha elections.        
	The Qureshi camps Safdar H. Khan defeated All India Muslim Personal Law Board member Kamal Farooqi for the post of vice-president. Wasi Ahmed Nomani retained his post as secretary.        
	Of the centres 1,200 Delhi-based members, 976 turned out to vote. Some 445 outstation members cast postal ballots.         
	The Islamic centre was inaugurated by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi in June 2006. Indira Gandhi had laid its foundation stone in 1984 when she was Prime Minister.

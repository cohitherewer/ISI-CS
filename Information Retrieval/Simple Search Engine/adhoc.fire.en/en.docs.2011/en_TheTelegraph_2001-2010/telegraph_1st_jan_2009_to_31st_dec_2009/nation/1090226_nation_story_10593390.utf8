          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 25: A typographical error in Pranab Mukherjees budget speech may help Rajasthan earn an Indian Institute of Management at a time the Centre is anxious to avoid upsetting any section of the electorate.         
	The acting finance minister today indicated the government would try and compensate for the error in his speech by opening an IIM in Rajasthan, though the state is not scheduled to receive the institute.         
	Under the eleventh five-year plan, the UPA government announced it would set up seven new IIMs, of which one in Shillong has started functioning.         
	The remaining six are to come up in Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Jammu and Kashmir, Haryana and Tamil Nadu.         
	Listing the governments achievements in education during his interim budget speech earlier this Parliament session, Mukherjee mentioned plans to set up an IIM in Rajasthan.         
	As reported first by The Telegraph, the mention of Rajasthan as the venue for an IIM was erroneous.         
	Today, Mukherjee was quizzed about the error by veteran BJP MP Lalit Kishore Chaturvedi in the Rajya Sabha during question hour. Mukherjee accepted there had been a typographical error and, according to sources present in the House at the time, blamed the human resource development ministry for it.         
	The HRD ministry has accepted it made a mistake, Mukherjee said. The senior leader was correct  the error in his speech did creep in thanks to a gaffe by the HRD ministry.         
	But late tonight, a senior HRD official suggested the ministry was unhappy with Mukherjees public distancing from the error.         
	After accepting the error, the senior minister went on to assure the House that apart from the six new IIMs that would come up, Rajasthan too would get an IIM.         
	Government officials, however, said they fear the confusion and potential for controversy may not die down with Mukherjees statement.         
	Late this evening, Chaturvedis office in Rajasthan issued a statement claiming Mukherjee had assured that Rajasthans IIM would start this year.         
	Sources present in the House at the time of Mukherjees statement said they did not recall him making any such definitive commitment.         
	Less than three months before the start of the 2009 academic session, it is now almost impossible to start an IIM in Rajasthan this year, HRD ministry officials said.

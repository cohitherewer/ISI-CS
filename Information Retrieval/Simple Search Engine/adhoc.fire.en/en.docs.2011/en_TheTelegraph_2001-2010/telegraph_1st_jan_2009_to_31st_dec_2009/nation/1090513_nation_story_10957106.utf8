The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Want to beat CPM? Play copycat
                                                                                                               Want to beat CPM? Play copycat
          MANINI CHATTERJEE IN JAYANTIPUR (BONGAON)                                          
	Sitting in the courtyard of Trinamul activist Sheikh Huzur Alis house in this sprawling village on the India-Bangladesh border  the Petrapole check post is just half a kilometre away  64-year-old Muzamil Mondol strokes his white beard and says: We are trying to be today what the CPM used to be.         
	Huzur Ali, who is a member of the Chhoigaria gram panchayat, frowns at this left-handed compliment to the Left but Muzamil (who is more Congress than Trinamul) persists. There was a time when CPM boys used to go from house to house whenever they needed food before any big meeting in town. They would go to one and say, mashima, can you give us two rotis, to another and say, kakima, a few rotis and some curry please, and in this way get a little something and involve everybody.         
	That was then. Now, says Huzur Ali, they order chicken biryani from the Matri Mandir hotel at Bongaon. They have become well-fed and lazy, we are with the poor. At our party meetings, you will only find cycles, at most a couple of motorcycles. Go to their meeting, and there will be dozens of motorcycles  every worker has one.         
	Muzamil, older and less partisan than Huzur Ali, concedes that there are many good people in the CPM still but their hands are tied because of the sangathan (organisation) that reigns supreme. The difference between us and them is that we instinctively help the poor. But if a CPM worker sees a man drowning before his eyes, he will have to first check with his branch secretary before he can save him.         
	Left leaders and supporters we meet in course of our journey through the Barasat, Bongaon and Bashirhat Lok Sabha seats in this eastern belt of North 24-Parganas district are entirely dismissive of the Oppositions claim of being champions of the poor. In class terms, the Congress-Trinamul combine represents the old and the new rich, the vested interests that have emerged as an offshoot of the visible development that has taken place over the last couple of decades, they insist.         
	That may be true in the ultimate analysis. But as of now, one reason Trinamul is on a strong wicket  particularly in the Bongaon constituency  is that it has acquired a pro-poor image and party activists are doing everything to emulate the CPM, in terms of both organisation and rhetoric.         
	At the Trinamul office at Bongaon town, there is a palpable air of optimism and exuberance. Bongaon (SC) is a new post-delimitation seat and perhaps the only Lok Sabha constituency in the country under which all seven Assembly seats also fall in the reserved category.         
	Trinamul Congress youth wing district president Ratan Ghosh proudly tells us: Bongaon ekdom TMCer ghati (this is a TMC stronghold). The party won all three Assembly segments of the Bongaon subdivision in 2006 and swept the panchayat polls. In fact, the anti-Left forces won as many as 163 of the 200 gram panchayats in North 24-Parganas district.         
	After Calcutta South, Bongaon is our surest seat, says Ghosh. And the main reason, he claims, is that the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and the Muslims who once supported the Left are now with us.         
	Mamata Banerjee may be unpopular in Singur. But the twin issues of Singur and Nandigram have electrified the poor and middle peasantry in the district who fear losing their land and are now firmly behind Didi, add Ghosh and his fellow workers.         
	Confident of mass support, the Trinamul has also mastered the CPMs organisational methods, they say. We are like the CPM used to be. Our workers devote a minimum of 12 hours a day to the party and we too have wholetimers  who work without wages unlike in the CPM, says Ghosh. A core committee comprising five to seven members from each district meets every Friday at Mamata Banerjees Kalighat residence for stock taking. Phaki daawar kono upaay nei, phaki dilei shaasti (there is no scope for any slackness; if any one is slack, he is punished.)         
	Asserting that, like the CPM, their organisation has been strengthened right till the booth level, zilla parishad member Rahima Mondol  a feisty woman activist of the area  recalls with relish that during the last panchayat polls, we were at the centre all night but the CPM workers had to be called from home when the counting room was sealed.         
	Claiming that Mamata Banerjee is the biggest crowd-puller in the country after Indira Gandhi, Trinamul workers are confident that coupled with their new-found organisational strength, not only will their veteran candidate Gobind Chandra Nashkar trounce CPMs Ashim Bala, but the party will win all five seats in the district.         
	Like elsewhere in Bengal, the buzz in the bazaars and streets definitely tilts towards Trinamul but counter voices are also getting louder with each passing day. At a village corner in the staunchly pro-Trinamul Gaighata segment of Bongaon, a man tells us: Mamata Banerjee has played all her cards. She has nothing more to offer and that is why she is now trying to use the CPMs language. But people here are not fools  they know who stands for what.         
	In Bashirhat, where sitting CPI MP Ajoy Chakroborty is pitted against Trinamuls Haji Nurul Islam, the Left is confident that the reverses faced during the panchayat polls will be decisively reversed. At that time, the lack of Left unity played a big role. Also, Muslim fundamentalists joined hands with the Opposition to create a fear among the minorities with their pernicious propaganda that mosques and graveyards would be razed when land was taken for industry. That frenzy is over and the fundamentalists themselves are divided after Sidiqulla Chowdhury broke away from Mamata and is contesting the seat himself.         
	Yes, the panchayat polls inflicted big cracks on our base  but we have managed to repair them to a large extent, says Narayan Mondol, district secretary of the Krishak Sabha.         
	In Jayantipur village, Rehana Mondol  who admits being a Trinamul supporter  is not as sanguine of victory as the men in the village and on the streets. Hawa jokhon edike jaaye, hotaat odike jete pare... (when the wind blows in one direction, it can suddenly turn the other way), she says, inadvertently voicing the hopes of the Left which is banking on an undercurrent to reverse an overt wave.

                                                                                                               4 cops arrested in Shopian case
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Srinagar, July 15: A superintendent of police and three other officers were arrested today on the orders of Jammu and Kashmir High Court for allegedly destroying evidence in the Shopian rape and murder case.        
	The court said the officers DNA samples should be collected and compared with that of the swabs from the bodies of the two women. The four will also have to undergo narco-analysis tests.        
	The directive came after the special investigation team probing the case submitted a status report.         
	It said an FIR had been filed against SP Javed Iqbal Mattoo and three other police officers who were named in Justice Muzaffar Jans report for their involvement in destroying the evidence.         
	The SITs report mentions a vehicle that was used in the crime and that human hair was found in it. The court directed that the hair be sent for DNA profiling.         
	We feel the arrest of these officers followed by collection of their blood samples for the purpose of preparation of their DNA profile to match that with the DNA profile of the vaginal semen of the deceased ladies would expedite the investigation, the bench said.

                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Nepal strike starts with Maoist rampage
                              Maoists at a protest rally in Kathmandu (Reuters)                            
	Kathmandu, Dec. 20 (PTI): Nepals riot police clashed with Maoist supporters who blocked roads, attacked vehicles and forced shops to down shutters in order to impose a three-day nationwide strike.        
	The Maoists are mounting pressure on the government to rectify what they say was an unconstitutional decision of President Ram Baran Yadav to reinstate General Rookmangud Katawal as army chief after he was dismissed by then Maoist Prime Minister Prachanda in May.        
	Katawal, who has since been succeeded by General Chhatraman Singh Gurung, had resisted the inclusion of Maoist guerrillas in the Nepal army.        
	Today, over 62 Maoist activists were arrested across the country and 24 people were injured in the clashes with the police. Most of them were injured at the Baneshwor area in the capital.         
	The Maoist supporters blocked the road leading to the international airport on the eve of Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepals arrival from the UN climate summit in Copenhagen.         
	The police baton-charged the protesters and fired tear gas shells to control them.        
	Six policemen, including a deputy superintendent, were also injured in the clashes.        
	We used force after the protesters turned violent and began attacking the police by throwing stones, said an officer. We used water cannons and tear gas to bring the situation under control.        
	The agitators vandalised over a dozen vehicles in the capital.

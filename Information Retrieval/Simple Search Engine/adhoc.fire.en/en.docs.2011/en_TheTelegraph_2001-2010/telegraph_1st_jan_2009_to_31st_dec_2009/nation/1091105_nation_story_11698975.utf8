          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 4: The 48-hour Maoist bandh began today with the rebels torching a private guesthouse.        
	The guesthouse belonged to Essar Steel, a private steel company, at Gajiagoda in Chitrakonda area of Malkangiri. It was set on fire after midnight yesterday. Around 50 armed-rebels attacked the guesthouse and set it ablaze, said Malkangiri superintendent of police Satyabrata Bhoi.        
	Rebels assaulted the guesthouse guard and stormed into the building and beat up two company engineers. There were reports that the two were abducted following the attack, but police denied reports.         
	The guesthouse and its furniture have been partially damaged, Bhoi said.        
	The bandh was called in the states southern region to protest against the deployment of forces in these districts. The rebels are protesting the Centres decision to launch offensive against them and the alleged police excesses.        
	The rebels left posters at several places appealing to people to support the bandh.         
	Normal life was affected in Malkangiri, Koraput, Gajapati and Rayagada districts as rebels blocked roads by felling trees halting vehicular movement in areas. In Malkangiri, trees were felled along roads connecting Kalimela, Chitrakonda, MV-79 and Motu. Shops and business establishments were closed in some areas while they remained open at other places including Malkangiri town. Similarly, in Koraput, Narayanpatna remained cut off from rest of the state as Maoists blocked roads by felling trees.         
	In Sundergarh, the bandh had partial impact although the Rourkela-Barsuan rail traffic remains suspended for two days in view of the shutdown.        
	Meanwhile, patrolling was beefed up across the district. Security forces are on high alert in vulnerable areas such as police stations, outposts, railway stations and armouries.

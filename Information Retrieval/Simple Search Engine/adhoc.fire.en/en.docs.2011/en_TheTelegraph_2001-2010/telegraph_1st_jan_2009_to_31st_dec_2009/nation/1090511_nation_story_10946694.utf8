The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PM loses sleep over ally price
                                                                                                               PM loses sleep over ally price
          RASHEED KIDWAI                          Singh: Missing Left?                                  
	New Delhi, May 10: Manmohan Singh is confident about getting the numbers for a second term in office. But when he thinks about the price for prospective allies support, he sometimes wonders if its worth it, sources close to him said.        
	The paradox for Singh is that allies that may agree to him staying on as Prime Minister may make picking a cabinet of his choice difficult enough for him to want to stay out of it all.        
	The sources said the paradox was underlined when the Prime Minister began considering the composition of the next cabinet. He immediately started losing sleep, especially over the choice of finance minister.        
	Singh apparently doesnt want to shift P. Chidambaram from the home ministry. The Prime Minister is said to be deeply impressed by the way PC has injected efficiency and accountability in North Block, as a result of which the intelligence and security agencies have thwarted several attempts to destabilise the polls.        
	Pranab Mukherjee is being ruled out for a similar reason: he is too valuable a foreign minister at a time of change in Washington and turmoil in South Asia.        
	Left to himself, the Prime Minister may like to pick his close associate, Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia. But Singh knows that accommodating apolitical ministers will be difficult this time because the Congress will not get too many key portfolios.        
	As price for possible support, the post-poll allies  whether it is Sharad Pawar or Mulayam Singh Yadav or Nitish Kumar  would demand key ministries.        
	Pawar supporters are said to be insisting that their leader be elevated from agriculture to defence or the office of the deputy Prime Minister. Mulayam, a former defence minister and three-time Uttar Pradesh chief minister, may even want home.        
	If the Janata Dal (United), ADMK or the Telugu Desam also get in, the pie will need further slicing. Nitish, for instance, may demand finance for former bureaucrat and Planning Commission member N.K. Singh.        
	With key ministries divided among so many parties, running the government could become a headache, Singh feels.        
	The sources said that a worried Prime Minister had actually begun missing the Left. He has fondly been recalling how, in 2004, the Lefts 62 MPs had chosen to extend outside support, helping the Congress secure many portfolios.        
	The arrangement in 2004 was that each UPA partner would receive one portfolio for every four MPs it has. By that yardstick, the Left could have asked for 15 ministry posts that eventually went to the Congress.        
	The Prime Minister has been thinking aloud, the sources said, that unless the Congress is confident of having a cohesive and trustworthy cabinet, it might at least consider sitting in the Opposition.        
	Singh expects the Congress to win 164 seats and the UPA tally to be 218, a deficit of 54. He hopes the Left will come on board in the larger national interest.         
	And here lies the catch: the Left may be uneasy about supporting a government headed by Singh  an issue the Congress says is non-negotiable.

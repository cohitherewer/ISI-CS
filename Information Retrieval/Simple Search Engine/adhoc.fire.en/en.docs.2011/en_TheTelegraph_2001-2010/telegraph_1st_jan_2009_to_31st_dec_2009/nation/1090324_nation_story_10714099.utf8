The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | NCP nixes Cong plan 
                                                                                                               NCP nixes Cong plan 
          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                              
	Mumbai, March 23: The Congresss plans to ensure the Osmanabad seat in Maharashtra for former chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh has gone for a toss with ally NCP retaining it after prolonged negotiations between the partners.        
	The NCP, however, failed to get Jalna, which it had wanted from the Congress. The two seats and Shirdi in Nashik had become the focus of the talks between the allies in Maharashtra.        
	While the NCPs Laxman Dhobale had lost in Osmanabad to the Shiv Senas Kalpana Narhire by 2,000 votes in 2004, Congress candidate Uttamsingh Pawar lost in Jalna to the BJPs Raosaheb Danve Patil by 61,000 votes.        
	Adamant on retaining Osmanabad, the NCP succeeded in including it in its share of 22 seats compared with the Congresss 26.        
	The NCP had asked for Jalna but also wanted to keep Osmanabad. The Congress was willing to give Jalna in exchange for Osmanabad.         
	Sources said the Congress wanted Osmanabad to field either Deshmukh, sacked as chief minister after the Mumbai attack, or former Union home minister Shivraj Patil, whose constituency Latur has been declared a reserved seat after delimitation.        
	Also, Patil had suffered an embarrassing defeat in Latur at the hands of the BJPs Rupatai Patil in the 2004 elections.        
	But the NCP wanted to field Padamsinh Patil, a close associate of party boss Sharad Pawar, from Osmanabad.        
	Asked about the NCP retaining Osmanabad, Deshmukh said: I will get more time to concentrate on party campaigns. I am the chairman of the Congress election management committee for Maharashtra. It is up to the party to use my services as it wishes.        
	However, he still has hope as NCP leader Praful Patel said in Delhi that the allies would continue talks on swapping some seats.        
	The Congress will contest from Akola, Wardha, Gadchiroli-Chimur and Yavatmal-Washim, areas hit by farmer suicides.        
	The party has got five of the six constituencies in Mumbai. The NCP will contest from Mumbai North East.        
	The NCPs Sharad Pawar will fight from Madha and his daughter Supriya Sule from Baramati.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	Ranchi, Nov. 12: The hunt for Madhu Kodas alleged crores has so far thrown up a little over Rs 25 lakh.        
	The enforcement directorate (ED) and state income-tax department have recovered Rs 23.65 lakh and $3,430 (Rs 1.6 lakh) after raiding 69 premises owned by the former chief minister and two associates, Vinod Sinha and Sanjay Choudhary.        
	Tax official R.K. Lal today filed an affidavit in Jharkhand High Court saying his department was in touch with banks to find out about fixed deposits made in Kodas name.        
	Sleuths raided Kodas home on October 31 and are still interrogating him. Sinha and Choudhary have been evading interrogation. Jharkhand police today sounded an alert to all state and district police chiefs to arrest Sinha and Choudhary, co-accused with Koda in the assets case.        
	The ED has issued fresh summons to Mumbai-based bullion traders and hawala agents Manoj Punamia, Arvind Vyas and Lalit Jain to appear before it on November 16. The three businessmen are believed to have been close to Koda and his aides.        
	Sources said they had zeroed in on Punamia as the main hawala and bullion agent managing the alleged illegal transactions made abroad by Koda and his aides.        
	Vikas Sinha, brother of Vinod, is a partner in Balaji Bullion amp; Commodities and is in ED custody. His interrogators are said to be cross-checking facts with him.        
	Sources said both ED and tax sleuths had found out that most of the money allegedly amassed by Koda and his associates came from mining allotments to prospective investors, transfers and postings of technocrats and bureaucrats, and a Rs 1,480-crore rural electrification project.        
	The ED has approached Switzerland for information on investments and transactions by the accused. Earlier, authorities in Indonesia, the UAE, Liberia, Thailand and Singapore had been approached.

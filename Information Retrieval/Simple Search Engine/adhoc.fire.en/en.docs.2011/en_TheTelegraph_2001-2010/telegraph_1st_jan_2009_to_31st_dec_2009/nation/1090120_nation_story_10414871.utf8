          SANJAY K. JHA                            Kalyan, Shekhawat: Rebels                                 
	New Delhi, Jan. 19: The BJPs big plan to unveil 200 Lok Sabha candidates at one go stuttered today, with internal squabbles and ally trouble allowing it to name only 18.        
	The flop show forced the party to cut the scheduled three-day meeting of its central election committee to just a few hours.        
	Once bitten, the BJP announced that the next meeting  originally scheduled for January 28 and 29 to name the remaining candidates  would be a one-day affair on January 28.        
	Party sources said the election committee could not discuss candidates for a large number of key states. It struggled to stretch the list to 18, naming candidates mostly from states that count for little in the BJP scheme.        
	Six of the 18 are from Kerala, three from the Northeast, one from Dadra and Nagar Haveli, three from Himachal Pradesh, four from Jharkhand and one from Chandigarh.        
	The BJP is grappling with the Janata Dal (United), Biju Janata Dal and the Shiv Sena over seat shares, so it cannot release the lists for Bihar, Maharashtra and Orissa.        
	Some BJP state units are locked in internal wrangles over key constituencies, or are rocked by rebellions, such as by Bhairon Singh Shekhawat and Kalyan Singh.        
	Shekhawat has ensured a delay in Rajasthan; while the chief ministers of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh are too busy to send their lists.        
	Uttar Pradesh showcases the hastiness of the original schedule. The BJP had planned to name the candidates for all the 80 seats in the state as early as last August.        
	The list first got delayed by the turmoil at the Centre that led to the July trust vote. Then came the uncertainty over a possible alliance with Ajit Singhs Rashtriya Lok Dal, and then Kalyans dissidence.        
	Reports suggest Kalyan is exploring his options outside the BJP although the party has tried to please him by fielding him from Etah and bringing his confidante Kusum Rai to the Rajya Sabha.        
	Kalyan, who was anyway unhappy with the party leadership, has staked his prestige on the Bulandshahar seat. He has asked the BJP not to field Ashok Pradhan, whom he suspects of sabotaging his sons chances in the last Assembly polls, from the seat.        
	Now reports say Kalyan has met the Samajwadi Party chief. Mulayam Singh Yadav has issued a denial but, at the same time, stoked the fire by offering a seat to Kalyans son Rajbir.        
	This triggered protests by Pradhans supporters at the party headquarters, who demanded Rajbirs ouster. The BJP leadership, however, is still trying to pacify Kalyan.        
	Before todays 18, the BJP had named another dozen-and-a-half candidates in dribs and drabs, mostly big names such as L.K. Advani, Rajnath Singh and Kalyan. Today, Yashwant Sinha was fielded from Hazaribagh.

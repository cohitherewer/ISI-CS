                                                                                                               Pub sack row
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bangalore, March 2: The womens panel member sacked for for allegedly violating her mandate while probing the Mangalore pub attack today saw a conspiracy behind the move.        
	It is a deep-rooted conspiracy to tarnish my image. In the National Commission for Women, I was the only legally qualified member, Nirmala Venkatesh said. Removed last Friday over her controversial report on the January 24 attack, she said she would sue the panel and the Centre as well as write to the President. She resigned from the Congress yesterday.        
	The panel had rejected Venkateshs report, which had blamed the incident on the pub owner saying there was inadequate security at the joint and that he did not have a liquor licence.         
	Although the report had sought punishment for the men behind the attack, it had said other factors, including the nude dresses of the women, needed to be considered.         
	Today, Venkatesh suggested honest people were being targeted. Im blaming the system which is negative towards honest people, she said.        
	Venkateshs conspiracy allegations came as womens groups voiced concern about safety in Bangalore where, they claimed, at least three attacks occurred on the streets in the past 10 days.        
	The impunity enjoyed by the Mangalore attackers has emboldened criminal elements across the state and definitely in Bangalore, said a memorandum that Nirbhaya Karnataka, a forum of womens groups in the state, handed over to the Bangalore police commissioner today.

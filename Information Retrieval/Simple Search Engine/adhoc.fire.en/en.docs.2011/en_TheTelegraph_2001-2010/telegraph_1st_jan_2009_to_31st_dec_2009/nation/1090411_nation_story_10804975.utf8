The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitish firm on loyalty to Advani
                                                                                                               Nitish firm on loyalty to Advani
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Patna, April 10: Rejecting speculations that he might shift his loyalty after the elections, chief minister Nitish Kumar today strongly backed L.K. Advani as the next Prime Minister at their joint rally in Buxar.        
	Buxar  a constituency on the UP-Bihar border  has been also the road of film actor Sanjay Dutt and Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav to back the embattled Lalu Prasad and his RJD-LJP combination in Bihar today.        
	The congregation of stars of Indian politics at one place electrified the campaign in Bihar. The LJP-RJD meeting, however, drew a bigger crowd than the one that Nitish and Advani addressed in the same town.         
	But the presence of Munnabhai was stated to be the main reason for the troika of Lalu, Ram Vilas Paswan and Mulayam Singh Yadav pulling more audience.        
	A Prime Minister should also be a leader in a leader in first place. Therefore, I am urging you to vote for the NDA and let Advaniji  a leader in true sense  to form a government at the Centre, Nitish said, addressing a rally as he shared the stage with the veteran BJP leader at their first joint meeting in the state.        
	In return, Advani described Nitish as the best among the NDA chief ministers.        
	Advani also promised that a special status would be accorded to Bihar if the NDA came to power at Delhi.         
	We will ensure giving special status to Bihar for further pacing up the development work initiated by the Nitish-led government, if the alliance is voted to power, Advani said.        
	In a few words that might have soothed Advanis ears, Nitish said he had no personal complaints against the prime ministerial candidate, who was a good person and a scholar.        
	Referring to the cash-for-vote scam during the confidence motion in Parliament last year after the Left parted ways with the UPA, Advani said it was a national shame that the Congress-led government indulged in alleged horse-trading for its survival.         
	Apparently to avoid causing any discomfiture to Nitish, whose party JD(U) has disapproved the BJPs contentious agenda, including construction of Ram temple at Ayodhya, uniform civil code and repeal of Article 370, Advani chose to skirt these issues in Buxar. However, at Sasaram with Nitish not by his side, Advani said: We feel proud of our election manifesto.

                                                                                                               Two Lalit backers get right   to vote 
          OUR BUREAU                                    
	New Delhi/Jaipur, Feb. 27: The Supreme Court today permitted the president and the secretary of the Sriganganagar Cricket Association to vote in Sundays Rajasthan Cricket Association elections, giving a boost to the Lalit Modi camp.        
	In another fillip, the apex court-appointed poll observer cleared Modi to contest the election, where he is in the fray for the presidents post.        
	The Sriganganagar body had been dissolved by the Rajasthan registrar of societies on February 20  the day the court ordered the RCA polls held on March 1  over complaints that its internal elections had been faulty.        
	The district body, ruled by Modi supporters, went to the high court against the decision but lost. In the Supreme Court, its counsel Mukul Rohatgi wondered why the association needed to be dissolved a week before the elections and asked that at least its president and secretary be allowed to vote.        
	The court upheld the appeal but added the duos votes would be subject to the final order in the case.        
	Sriganganagar association president Mahmud Abdi said the Modi camp had the support of 24 of the 32 districts. Kota association secretary Amin Pathan backed him up, saying: We have enough districts in our hand.        
	Modis opponents, led by RCA secretary Subhash Joshi, claim the backing of 25 associations.        
	Ashok Ohri, contesting against Modi for the post of president, said: Anyway, the Sriganganagar votes will not be counted now. We are sure of winning and our rivals are sure of their defeat.        
	Poll observer and retired Supreme Court judge N.M. Kasliwal cleared Modi as well as Barmer Cricket Association president Sanjay Dixit to contest the elections, a PTI report said. Dixit, an IAS officer, has filed nominations for both president and secretary.        
	The objections against Modi related to his domicile and his conviction in the US two decades ago. The former judge felt that since Modi had been allowed to contest the previous election, it would not be right to raise these objections now.

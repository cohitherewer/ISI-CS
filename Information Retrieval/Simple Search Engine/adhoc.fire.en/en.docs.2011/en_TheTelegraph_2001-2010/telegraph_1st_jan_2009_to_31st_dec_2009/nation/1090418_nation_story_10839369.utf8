The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hurriyat split on boycott
                                                                                                               Hurriyat split on boycott
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Srinagar, April 17: The Hurriyat Conferences moderate faction led by Mirwaiz Umer Farooq today decided not to issue a boycott call for this election, but militant leaders have vowed to stay away.        
	The failure of the boycott call during last years state elections  when people trooped to booths in large numbers  appears to have forced a rethink in the Hurriyat faction.        
	Officially, the outfit said there was no point asking people to shun the Lok Sabha polls as the exercise had nothing to do with the resolution of the Kashmir problem.        
	Elections are for day-to-day governance and development. They are a non-issue (in solving the larger Kashmir problem) for us. At the same time, they are not an alternative to the right to self-determination, Hurriyat leader Abbas Ansari said.         
	Militants reacted angrily to the move. People should boycott the elections. The hypocritical elements should either join the pro-India camp openly or whole-heartedly commit themselves to the ranks of the Hurriyat, a spokesperson of the Muzaffarabad-based United Jehad Council, an alliance of militant groups, said.         
	The spokesperson alleged that some people were using Hurriyat outfits and causing great damage to the freedom movement by strengthening the illegal occupation by India and promoting New Delhis interests.        
	Both hardline and moderate factions of the Hurriyat had boycotted the state polls. Only the former has renewed the call this time.         
	Militants, too, had announced a boycott during the Assembly polls, but without using force. They kept their word.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | 6/6 in Mumbai
                                                                                                               6/6 in Mumbai
          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                              
	Mumbai, May 16: Raj Thackerays Maharashtra Navnirman Sena has played spoiler for cousin Uddhav swallowing over a lakh votes in each seat and allowing the ruling Congress-NCP alliance to sweep the Lok Sabha polls in Mumbai.         
	The combine won all six seats in the aftermath of November 26 terror attacks.        
	The victory was an unexpected repeat of 2004 when the Congress had won five of the six seats. Uddhavs party, the Shiv Sena, got only one.         
	Given the fact that Mumbai reeled under catastrophe after catastrophe beginning with the July 26, 2005, deluge, the July 11, 2006, serial train blasts and the terror attacks, the pre-poll surveys had predicted the Sena-BJP alliance would win at least three of the six seats, including Mumbai South.         
	The MNS candidates were expected to cut into the Sena-BJPs Marathi vote bank but the final results showed that Rajs party got many more votes than expected, especially in Mumbai.         
	State Congress chief Kripa Shankar Singh described the victory as the reply by north Indian voters to the MNS campaign and a nod to the ruling alliances inclusive politics.         
	Each seat had an average of 20 per cent north Indian voters who seem to have voted for the Congress. In Mumbai South, for instance, the Senas five-time MP Mohan Rawale was relegated to the third spot with 1,46,118 votes, while MNSs Bala Nandgaonkar was second. Sitting MP Milind Deora polled 2,72,411 votes defeating Nandgaonkar by a margin of 1,12,682.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 18: The Supreme Court today chided the government for playing it safe by offering to contest a case filed by two Muslim airmen challenging an air force rule against allowing beards.        
	The two-judge bench was quick to realise that the sensitive issue was being pushed into its court, especially because the government had earlier said it would rethink the rule. Has it become too hot for you to handle? the bench asked. Now you want to put in court (to decide), Justice D.K. Jain remarked acidly.         
	When the government contests the case, the pros and cons of the no-beard rule will be debated before the bench. The Supreme Court will have to take the final call then, not the government.        
	The Centre had first defended the IAFs no-beard rule in an affidavit.         
	The airmen  Mohammed Zubair and Aftab Ahmed Ansari  had challenged a 2003 air force order disallowing beards.         
	Sikhs are exempted from complying with the rule.         
	The duo first challenged the rule in Punjab and Haryana High Court, but lost. Then they appealed before the Supreme Court, saying their religion did not allow them to shave their beards.        
	The government initially defended the rule. The practice of growing and keeping a beard is optional and sporting a beard is not universally recognised in the religion of Islam. Therefore, it cannot be said that the Muslim religion prohibits the cutting of hair or shaving, it said.         
	Earlier this year, realising that a tough stand may stoke religious controversy, the government told the court that it would rethink the rule.         
	Consequently, the case kept getting deferred. But after a scolding from the court at the last hearing, the government conveyed today it would contest the case.

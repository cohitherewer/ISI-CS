The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cry for son as successor   Party fears fight among factions
                                                                                                               Cry for son as successor     Party fears fight among factions
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA AND SANJAY K. JHA                                                  The debris of the Bell 430 helicopter atop a hillock near Kurnool in Andhra Pradesh    
	Hyderabad/New Delhi, Sept. 3: Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddys death has already set off a succession race, prompting the Congress to pick a non-controversial caretaker chief minister to prevent an immediate faction war.        
	As various camps staked their claims within hours of the disclosure of the chief ministers death, finance minister K. Rosaiah, 77, was sworn in, though YSRs No. 2 was his chellema (little sister) and vaunted mascot, home minister Sabitha Reddy.        
	Many fear that the exit of YSR, who exercised a tight grip on party and government, will see an eruption of the pent-up dissidence he had so successfully quelled with the high commands unwavering support. Another fallout could be the return of the Telengana issue to the centre stage after being pushed to the sidelines by the late chief minister.                    YS Rajasekhar Reddy rsquo;s body being shifted from a helicopter to a garlanded van at Begumpet airport in Hyderabad on Thursday.    
	Without YSR, the Congress will be back to its old status of a dissidence-ridden, factionalism-oriented, pro-Telengana party, a senior Congress leader said.        
	Most Congress veterans here resented YSRs tough approach to problems in the state unit and his rapport with the high command. His critics such as former home minister K. Jana Reddy and former panchayati raj minister J.C. Diwakar Reddy have now become rallying points within the party.        
	On the other hand, around 120 MLAs have signed a memorandum demanding YSRs son Jaganmohan Reddy, a first-time MP with limited experience, be made chief minister. The state cabinet, meeting under Rosaiah this evening, too decided to petition Sonia Gandhi to consider the Kadapa MP for the top job.

	However, several Congress leaders from Telengana, who had kept away from party activities in the face of YSRs growing clout, called on M. Veerappa Moily, the central party leader in charge of Andhra affairs, this morning. They apparently demanded that the next chief minister be from Telengana since YSR belonged to Rayalaseema.        
	The Congresss central leadership realises that passions are running high after the tragedy, and the best option is to delay the decision on a successor by picking a caretaker while Moily sounds out senior party leaders in the state. The legislature party is to meet only after the mourning period ends, maybe a fortnight from now.        
	Jostling for the top post, however, is expected to accelerate as soon as the funeral ends tomorrow evening. The names of Union ministers Jaipal Reddy and D. Purandeswari (N.T. Rama Raos daughter) are doing the rounds.                          (Top) Rosaiah, Jaganmohan on Thursday. (PTI)      
	Former Union minister G. Venkatswamy is in the fray too, although the Dalit leader is over 80. If the party wants a backward-class chief minister, state Congress president D. Srinivas may come into the picture despite losing the last Assembly elections.        
	The cries for Jaganmohan have so far been the loudest. Unconfirmed reports said a signature campaign on his behalf had been launched, and an MLA from Kadapa had offered to vacate his seat for the MP. When YSRs body was brought to Hyderabad, many held up placards supporting his sons claims.        
	The party knows that until the passions subside, a consensus is impossible on anyone except Jaganmohan. It also believes that Rosaiah, a Bania, cannot lead the party in elections despite his competence and seniority because of the Reddy-dominated Congress politics in the state.        
	One proposal is to give a Reddy the reins after a while  maybe even a year or two  since elections are almost five years away.         
	Since Banias are not an influential caste in Andhra, removing Rosaiah later may not be a difficult task. By that time, Jaganmohan can learn the intricacies of governance.        
	Todays cabinet meeting passed condolence resolutions on the death of YSR and the others on his helicopter.

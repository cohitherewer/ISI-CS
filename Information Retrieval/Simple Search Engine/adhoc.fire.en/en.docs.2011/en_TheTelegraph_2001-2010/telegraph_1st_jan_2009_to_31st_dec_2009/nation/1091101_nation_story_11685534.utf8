The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Koda quizzed after raid on 60 properties 
                                                                                                               Koda quizzed after raid on 60 properties 
          OUR BUREAU                          Madhu Koda                                  
	Oct. 31: The income tax department was questioning former Jharkhand chief minister Madhu Koda late this evening after raiding 60 properties allegedly owned by him in Calcutta, New Delhi, Mumbai and several other cities.        
	The widening crackdown has raised the possibility of the arrest of Koda, who had ruled the state with UPA support between February 2006 and August 2008, ahead of the Assembly elections on November 25.        
	Koda, who has pledged unsolicited support to the UPA at the Centre, is expected to field several Independent candidates in the Assembly elections.        
	The raids, which began at 9.30am, were carried out by at least 70 teams of 400 tax investigators assisted by officials of the Enforcement Directorate. All his properties, including those in Lucknow, Nashik, Ranchi, Chaibasa and Jamshedpur, were searched.        
	The 38-year-old Koda, whose interrogation could continue through the night, is the first former chief minister to have been booked under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.         
	Now an Independent MP from Chaibasa, he has been charged with money laundering and diversion of state funds to the tune of crores. Koda has denied the charges and says he is a victim of political vendetta.        
	It appears there were unaccounted money transactions when Koda was mines minister in the Arjun Munda government and subsequently during (his) chief ministership, director of investigation (income tax) Ujjwal Choudhary told reporters in Ranchi after the raids.        
	 The premises of Kodas alleged associates, Sanjay Chaudhary and Binod Sinha, were also raided.        
	Neither Sanjay Chaudhary nor Sinha could be traced, prompting the IT director to issue a 24-hour deadline for them to appear before the department, failing which they could be arrested.        
	Choudhary said Sinha and Sanjay Chaudhary appear to have shipped out over $10 million to the United Arab Emirates, Thailand and Malaysia through havala agents, two of whom, Lalit Jain and Arvind Vyas, were being questioned in Mumbai.        
	He pointed out that during the past 18 months, the turnover of three relatively new companies floated by Sinha had shot up to Rs 1,200 crore.         
	In Ranchi, 24 places were raided and 30 other sites surveyed. The premises of Kodas former private secretary, Arun Kumar Shrivastava, were searched, too.        
	The Enforcement Directorate had registered a case against Koda and three of his ministerial colleagues on October 8, charging him with having made illegal investments abroad, including purchase of mines in Liberia.

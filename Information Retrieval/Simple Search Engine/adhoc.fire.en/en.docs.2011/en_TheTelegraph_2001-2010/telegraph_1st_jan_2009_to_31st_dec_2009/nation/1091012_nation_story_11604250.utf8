                                                                                                               ICU power cut death 
                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 11 (PTI): A 74-year-old woman on ventilator in the ICU of a government hospital here allegedly died because of a power failure.        
	Sharda Gaur, who was admitted to the coronary care unit of G.B. Pant Hospital, died yesterday after the ventilator could not be operated for about 45 minutes because of the power failure, sources said.        
	Her death came a day before her 75th birthday.         
	Delhi health minister Kiran Walia said she had sought a report on the incident.         
	Walia said she had been told there was a power failure for a while. Whatever it is, there should have been a stand-by system, she said.

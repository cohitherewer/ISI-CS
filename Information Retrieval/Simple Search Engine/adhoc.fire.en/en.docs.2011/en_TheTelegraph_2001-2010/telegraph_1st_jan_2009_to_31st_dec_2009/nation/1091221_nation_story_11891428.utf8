                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Inside House, cosy bedfellows     -  Opposition closes ranks against UPA 
          OUR BUREAU                                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 20: Parliaments winter session began with a united Opposition line-up against the Centre and closed with the Left, BJP, Samajwadi Party and others grilling the government over issues surrounding 26/11 suspect David Headley.        
	Actually, the session hasnt yet closed  and at the Rajya Sabhas last sitting on Monday to specially discuss the Copenhagen fallout, the Left and the BJP are set to put environment minister Jairam Ramesh through the wringer. The Lok Sabha was adjourned sine die on Friday.        
	In the monsoon session, when the combined Opposition prevented the government from introducing the Judges (Declaration of Assets and Liabilities) Bill, the UPA dismissed it as a blip on its radar screen, a one-off occurrence that was unlikely to crystallise into a long-term strategy.        
	It seemed like that again when Parliament was adjourned for two consecutive days after it opened for the November-December session. The BJP, Left, Samajwadis, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Rashtriya Lok Dal came together to protest the Centres sugar deregulation policy inside the House and outside. They forced an assurance that the policy would be amended.        
	Although the outcome was tangible and good enough, a BJP MP conceded the Opposition would have to do much more before it could claim it had tasted blood.        
	The UPA is comfortable, the Congress has had back-to-back electoral victories while we and the Left suffered reverses. Remember the old adage about strength in numbers? If we sustain that through the session, its no mean achievement, he said.                        Brinda Karat, Arun Jaitley      
	The Opposition succeeded in that objective.        
	A dozen times at least, the Left, BJP, Samajwadis, BSP and the ADMK together powered the charge against the Centre. The issues ranged from climate change and the demand for Karnataka chief justice P.D. Dinakarans impeachment to the governments failure to punish the accused in the 1984 anti-Sikh riot killings and the unfairness of the Trinamul Congresss clamour to dismiss the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government.        
	Addressing the BJP members on December 15, L.K. Advani, the outgoing leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, described the solidarity displays as the highpoint of the winter session.        
	Advani said a rattled government tried to breach the unity by bringing in the Liberhan commission report on the Babri demolition. It hoped to play on the communal-secular fault-lines. But we didnt break that much, he said.        
	The absence of P.V. Narasimha Raos name from Liberhans list of culpables  and the inclusion of Atal Bihari Vajpayees  gave some in the Opposition an opportunity to question the reports impartiality and an excuse to maintain equal distance from the BJP and the Congress.        
	At the end of a four-day debate in both Houses along familiar lines, the Congress ended up sounding defensive about Vajpayee, the BJP was faithful to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh diktat of no regret, no apology while the Samajwadis and the Left apportioned equal blame to the two national parties.        
	The BJPs gain was that it succeeded in putting Liberhan behind it and getting on with the Lefts help on other matters.        
	On December 11, a starred question from the BJPs Nishikant Dubey, voicing concern over the privatisation of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, witnessed a show of hands in support from the Left, Samajwadis and the NDA.        
	The price rise protests saw the sugar solidarity on display again as Arun Jaitley, Brinda Karat and Amar Singh marched together, holding placards. A joint motion from the Opposition seeking the impeachment of Justice Dinakaran was admitted by Rajya Sabha Chairperson Hamid Ansari on Thursday.        
	None of the Opposition parties nurses the illusion that the parliamentary co-operation would lead to realignment on the ground. Except perhaps the Left and the Samajwadis, old friends who were briefly estranged when Mulayam Singh Yadav bailed out the UPA during the 2008 trust vote.        
	CPM member Brinda Karat denied there was floor co-ordination with the BJP. We take our position on our understanding of issues and legislation, she said.        
	Advani said he was optimistic that the winter sessions experience would encourage the Opposition to confront the government in the next budget session more methodically.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Naveen denies apex court snub
                                                                                                               Naveen denies apex court snub
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Naveen Patnaik with Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi at the chief ministers meet in New Delhi                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 8: Stung by criticism over a Supreme Court rap on the Kandhamal issue, chief minister Naveen Patnaik today made a desperate face-saving attempt and denied that the apex court had directed it to protect the minority community or quit.        
	During the Kandhamal case hearing on January 5, an SC bench had observed that if the state government could not do enough to protect members of the minority community, it should quit.        
	Naveen, who returned from New Delhi last night, told reporters here: This was a passing observation made by one of the judges during the hearing. But it was not reflected in the verdict of the court.        
	The chief ministers clarification came in the wake of the demand by Opposition parties for his resignation arguing that the apex court had indicted the state government for its failure in protecting minorities in Kandhamal. The Supreme Courts verdict was a clear indictment of the state governments failure in protecting the minorities in Kandhamal and this government should not continue in power even for a moment in view of the Supreme Courts strictures, leader of the Opposition J.B. Patnaik said.        
	Even CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan had asked Naveen to quit or break alliance with the BJP.         
	The very basis of the Opposition demand was baseless and aimed at misleading people, Naveen said. On the other hand, the government would abide by the apex courts directives in letter and spirit, he said.        
	The chief minister said the Supreme Court had asked the state government to discuss with the Centre if it wanted retention of central paramilitary forces longer.         
	Similarly, the apex court had directed the state government to prepare an action plan for providing assistance to the damaged religious institutions and take appropriate decision in this regard, he said.        
	Responding to a query on the seat sharing talks with coalition partner BJP for the coming Lok Sabha and Assembly polls, Naveen said there was no discussion with the BJP central leadership on the matter during his stay in Delhi. Discussion on seat sharing would be held at appropriate place at appropriate time, said the BJD chief.

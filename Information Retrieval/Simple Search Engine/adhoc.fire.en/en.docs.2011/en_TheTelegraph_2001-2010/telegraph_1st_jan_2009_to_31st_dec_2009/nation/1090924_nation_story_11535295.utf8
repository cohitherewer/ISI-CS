The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | NCP drops winnability to keep flock together
                                                                                                               NCP drops winnability to keep flock together
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 23: Fear of covert subversion by unhappy party leaders may have forced the Nationalist Congress Party to give up on its post-Lok Sabha poll plan to use winnability as the only yardstick while nominating candidates for Maharashtra.        
	Keeping its flock together is emerging as the partys biggest consideration while doling out tickets for the coming Maharashtra polls, NCP sources said, admitting that it is fear rather than confidence that dominates their minds.        
	The party has risked angering workers of its ally, the Congress, in key areas of Maharashtra and has stuck with existing MLAs in other constituencies where its own workers wanted replacements, the sources conceded.        
	The truth is that we go into these Maharashtra elections low on confidence. If any major leader works against the party, even covertly, it may kill the confidence of the party, a senior leader said.        
	The NCP is contesting 114 seats of the 288 in the state, leaving the remaining to its ally Congress.         
	The party in Mumbai today announced names for 80 of these 114 seats. Sitting MLAs and state government ministers have been allotted a vast majority of tickets  even in seats where the NCPs own feedback is not favourable on the candidate.        
	The reason: the candidate in question wields enough clout over a particular community to damage the partys prospects in other neighbouring seats.         
	While there was never serious doubt over former deputy chief minister Chhagan Bhujbals nomination from Nashik, the party has also accepted Bhujbals nominees for most seats in that region.        
	A former minister Daulatrao Aher has quit the party and joined the BJP ostensibly because the NCP opted for Bhujbals nominees over his even in a few seats where the partys feedback suggested Aher was right.         
	Both Aher and Bhujbal belong to the influential Mali community and the formers desertion could split the partys vote from this community.         
	But NCP leaders argue that attempting to balance nominees of both Bhujbal and Aher could have upset the former. Bhujbals support is viewed by the party as more critical than retaining Aher  even if it means risking a handful of seats.        
	The same argument has led to the party risking angering workers of its ally, the Congress, in sections of the state.        
	Party chief Sharad Pawars nephew Ajit Pawars nominees for seats around Pune have been picked despite opposition from the junior Pawars bete noire  Congress MP Suresh Kalmadi.         
	In some seats, we are unlikely to have much support from Congress workers around Pune, an NCP source said.         
	The party could be worst hit by Congress anger in some seats in the southern Marathwada belt. Here it has fielded candidates handpicked by state minister Rana Jagjitsinh Patil, son of senior NCP leader Padmasinh Patil, who is in jail facing allegations of killing a Congress worker Pawanraje Nimbalkar.        
	Jagjitsinh Patil has been nominated from the Osmanabad constituency where he will face off against Nimbalkars son Omraje, contesting on a Shiv Sena ticket.

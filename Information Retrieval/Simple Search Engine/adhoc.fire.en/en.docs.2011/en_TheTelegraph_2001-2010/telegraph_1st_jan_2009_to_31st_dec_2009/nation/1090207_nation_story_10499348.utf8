The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sonia sings PM praise, seal awaited
                                                                                                               Sonia sings PM praise, seal awaited
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          The clear leader?                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 6: Sonia Gandhi is likely to clear the air on the leadership question in the Congress at a party convention in the capital on Sunday.         
	The Congress is kicking off its election campaign at a meeting of nearly 10,000 delegates  mostly block and district presidents from across the country.         
	Although Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, recuperating at home after heart surgery, cannot attend this gathering, he will send a message which will be read out with Sankalp (resolution) 2009, being drafted by general secretary Digvijay Singh, sources said.        
	Sonia brought up the leadership issue, although tangentially, in the monthly in-house magazine Sandesh. She praised Singh for his wisdom and sagacity, his humility and simplicity and his quiet but firm resolve and his sobriety and dignity.        
	He has led the UPA government with great distinction. He has many more years of service both to our party and to our country. We look forward to his continued leadership and his inspiration to the younger generation particularly, Sonia said.        
	Congress sources said this statement was the closest they could expect to declaring a leader, although Sonia didnt say in so many words that Singh would lead the party in the 2009 elections.        
	Jayanthi Natarajan, the party spokesperson, later said: Manmohan Singh is our Prime Minister and there is no vacancy to the post of the PM. It would not be proper for me to interpret her (Sonias) statements.        
	On August 15 last year, Singh was asked if he would unfurl the flag at the Red Fort in 2009 as well. Then, the Congress president had stepped in to say: Certainly.        
	The Congress style is to drop hints rather than come out with an open pronouncement on party matters.        
	Typically, party strategists are still assessing Singhs assets and drawbacks. The broad view is while he commands enormous goodwill among the urban upper and middle classes who see him as their best bet to steer the economy through choppy waters, party workers are not enthused by him.         
	In the Chattisgarh elections, for example, we tried to persuade our workers to have the Prime Minister address at least a dozen meetings. They reluctantly agreed to one or two. Its unfortunate because this Prime Minister has done more for the peasants than any other Prime Minister has. Yet the party has not propagated the achievements effectively, a state leader said.        
	The perception was reflected in election posters in Lucknow. That carried pictures of Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, but left out Singh. The punchline was telling: Bhavishya ka saath dein, Congress ka saath dein (Vote for the future, vote for the Congress).        
	Sources said they expected to get an oblique sense of what the workers think of the UPA government at the Sunday convention where outstation delegates will hold the stage after Sonia is done with her inaugural address.         
	We imagine it will be a no-holds barred meeting just like the last one (held in 2003) where the grassroots functionaries openly criticised leaders and party policies, a general secretary said.        
	Barring Rahul, Pranab Mukherjee, Mani Shankar Aiyar and the general secretary in charge of the organisation, Janardhan Dwivedi, no other leader is likely to speak.        
	In the Prime Ministers absence, Mukherjee is likely to enunciate the Centres achievements and policies. As the panchayati raj minister, Aiyar will dwell on the governments rural empowerment agenda.

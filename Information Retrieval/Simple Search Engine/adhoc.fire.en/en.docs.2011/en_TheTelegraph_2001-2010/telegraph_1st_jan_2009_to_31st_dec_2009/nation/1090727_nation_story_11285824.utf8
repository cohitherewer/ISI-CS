          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, July 26: The BJP is keen to bring back journalist Chandan Mitra to the Rajya Sabha, this time as a party member, though he may not get a full six-year term.        
	Mitra, nominated to the House by the President during NDA rule, completes his term in August. Sources said the BJP had asked its Madhya Pradesh unit to spare one of the two vacant seats in the state for an outsider.        
	The state unit wants both seats for local politicians, and the central leadership will take a decision in a couple of days. Mitra faces stiff challenge from Piyush Goel, son of BJP leader Ved Prakash Goel.        
	The vacancies were created after Sushma Swaraj and N.S. Tomar were elected to the Lok Sabha. Sushma had three years left of her term, Tomar only a year. State leaders say Mitra can at best have Tomars seat. Kaptan Singh is the front runner for the other seat.

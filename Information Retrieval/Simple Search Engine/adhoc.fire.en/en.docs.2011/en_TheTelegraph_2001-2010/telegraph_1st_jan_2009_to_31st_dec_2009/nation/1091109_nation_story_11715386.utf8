          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Nov. 8: Orissa Human Rights Commission has ordered an inquiry into the rehabilitation and resettlement of people who were displaced by projects that began in the fifties.         
	The order was issued after complaint petitions were filed on behalf of Bisthapita Dahayak Sangha, a Rourkela-based NGO. The commission has directed the commissioner-cum-secretary of revenue and disaster management to inquire into the statements made in the PIL and submit a report within six weeks, said the NGOs legal advisor advocate Bharat Kumar Mishra at a news conference here today.         
	The commissions order was served on Thursday, he added. Petitions allege that the government acquired landed property belonging to tribals for Hirakud Dam, Machchkund Hydro-electric Project, Mahanadi Valley Scheme, Rourkela Steel Plant and Madira Dam without providing R amp;R package for those displaced.        
	Though land was acquired between 1952 and 1957, till today the R amp;R has not been ameliorated, the PILs further alleged. The PILs have also sought reverting of surplus land. According to conservative estimates around 4-lakh acres were acquired for the four projects, displacing nearly 40-lakh people. The land was acquired by under Orissa Development of Industries, Irrigation, Agriculture, Capital Construction and Resettlement of Displaced Persons (Land Acquisition) Act, 1948.         
	Ironically, the act had not received the Presidents assent and was repealed in 1994, pushing the problems of compensation, rehabilitation and resettlement into further limbo, the sanghs legal advisor rued.

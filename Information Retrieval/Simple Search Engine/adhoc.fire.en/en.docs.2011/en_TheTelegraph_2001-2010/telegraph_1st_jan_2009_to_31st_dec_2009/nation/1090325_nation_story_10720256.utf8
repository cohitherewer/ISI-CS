          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 24: The Congress today said its ability to balance contradictions by taking the middle path was the only way to run the country.        
	The party poll manifesto, released today, contrasted the BJPs narrow communalism with the Congresss liberal nationalism and slammed the Left-led third front for fostering political instability.        
	It claimed that balance had been the hallmark of the Congresss policies and had buffered India against the current global recession.        
	It is a balance between the public sector and the private sector... between taking advantage of globalisation and ensuring that these benefits flow to local communities, between regulation by the government and unleashing the creative spirits of our entrepreneurs and professionals, said the document, released by Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.        
	It added: This balance is needed now more than ever.        
	The manifesto criticised the Left for adamantly refusing to listen to reasoned arguments that convincingly demonstrated that the (civil nuclear) agreement was in Indias supreme national interest.        
	It enlarged the scope of the agreement beyond the US, saying India had signed similar treaties with Russia, France and Kazakhstan.        
	On Pakistan and the Mumbai terror attacks, it said: The Congress has striven for an enduring peace and for close economic relations with Pakistan but the Mumbai attacks have cast a long shadow on the ongoing dialogue and engagement process.        
	It added: It is now entirely up to Pakistan to break the impasse by taking credible action against those responsible for the carnage in Mumbai. If it does so and dismantles the terrorist network from its soil, a Congress-led government will not be found wanting in its response.

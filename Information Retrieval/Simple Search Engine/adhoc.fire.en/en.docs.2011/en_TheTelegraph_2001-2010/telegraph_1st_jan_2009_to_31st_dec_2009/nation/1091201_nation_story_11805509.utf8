          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 30: The Supreme Court has refused to dispose of a case that alleges that the Maharashtra government has done little so far to check the Maharashtra Navnirman Senas attacks on north Indians, though the state insisted it had taken all necessary action.        
	The two-judge bench told Sugreev Dubey, who was defending the PIL: You file a counter (to the states claims).        
	The Maharashtra government said several cases had been filed against MNS chief Raj Thackeray under stringent provisions of the IPC and he had even been arrested to maintain peace and public order in Mumbai. It urged the court to dispose of the PIL, which the state counsel said was frivolous and based on incomplete information.         
	Government officials, including police authorities have taken all necessary action effectively curbing agitation against north Indians and to maintain law and order, an affidavit filed on behalf of the state said.         
	However, counsel Dubey, appearing for Delhi-based trader Salek Chand Jain, accused the state of abdicating its responsibility towards protecting the life and security of migrants and sought court intervention.         
	Jain alleged that not a single case had been registered against the MNS or its chief or members so far. Not a single case has been filed against Raj Thackeray, he said. Is using a particular language an offence under our Constitution? Dubey asked.

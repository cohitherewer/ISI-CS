The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ramayan in Nandi land   Lakshman faces an unfamiliar twist
                                                                                                               Ramayan in Nandi land     -  Lakshman faces an unfamiliar twist
          SUJAN DUTTA IN NANDIGRAM/HALDIA                          Trinamuls Subhendu Adhikari at the Mahisadal roadshow. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                        
	A petal of marigold tickles its way down Subhendu Adhikaris fine white kurta and lodges itself between his shoulder blades. Adhikari is standing on a chair in the flatbed rear of a small utility vehicle on a roadshow in Mahisadal.        
	He is trying hard to keep up the beatific smile because the tickle is discomforting, the chair on which he is standing is jerky and he is in danger of falling off every time the vehicle brakes, which is at every bend of the narrow, ribbony road, where women, many with children in their arms have gathered, and where more marigold flowers are showered on him and where babies are proferred to him to be kissed, and more petals are tickling in. They compete with beads of sweat that are tickling down from his crew-cut.        
	Those outside on the road do not know but Subhendu is held tight by two men inside the vehicle. They bend down and hold him tight at the thigh and the waist so that he can stand as straight as possible and wave and keep the smile and wave. A third youth occasionally dips his hand through the kurta and attempts to clear the petals that are oh soticklish!        
	Some petals are now lodging themselves not only between the kurta and the vest but also between the vest and the backbone! Warmth can get so cloying in the heat of an election campaign. But Subhendu is soldiering on.        
	This is in the Tamluk Lok Sabha constituency where the Trinamul feels it is not only sighting victory but is about to make its win exemplary. Nandigram is the largest Assembly segment here.        
	I have taken on the strongest and richest CPM candidate, Subhendu says repeatedly when there is a break in the crowds that have lined up to greet him during this roadshow through 11 gram panchayats.        
	The central theme of Subhendus campaign is revenge. Revenge against the CPM for what it did in Nandigram.                        CPM candidate Lakshman Seth leads a rally in Haldia. Picture by Pradip Sanyal      
	In Nandigram and Mahisadal at least there is little doubt that Subhendu is the favourite. Those are two of the seven Assembly segments in Tamluk Lok Sabha constituency.        
	In an office of the Bhoomi Ucchhed Pratirodh Committee (BUPC) in Nandigram, that is for practical purposes a Trinamul-led outfit, they estimate that the trends in the last panchayat poll and the Assembly bypoll indicate that Subhendu will take leads from each of the segments but Bhawanipur. That will be enough for the Trinamul to get a lead of at least 112,000.        
	In the Assembly bypoll, Trinamuls Feroza Bibi won with a margin of about 39,500 votes. In the zilla parishad, the Trinamul led in 37 out of 42 panchayat areas. In a trade union election in Haldia, too, Trinamul has won in election after election, an argument that Lakshman Seth does not accept.        
	Seth is focusing his campaign on workers meetings organised by the Citu. At a meeting in front of the Exide factory main gate, he says he may have made mistakes. Chief among these mistakes, he says, was that he  or the party  did not deliver political education at the pace at which he delivered development.        
	Then, in a massive leap of ideology, faith and mythology that only he is capable of, the trade unionist and three-time MP says, his detractors do not know that he has a level of political immortality because they have not read the Ramayan.        
	In the Ramayan, he thunders, Lakshman is merely wounded, he is not killed. Those who think I will be killed politically are grossly mistaken.         
	Seth has raised the contest for Haldia into an epic battle.        
	He defeated Subhendu, who, he does not hesitate to point out is from South Contai and is therefore an outsider, in the last Lok Sabha election. Subhendu is an obstructionist, against development, says Seth.         
	But in Mahisadal, where Subhendu was campaigning, women and families were blowing conch shells and welcoming him, rickshaw-wallahs were asking passengers to wait so that they could go and greet the Trinamul candidate and shopkeepers were leaving their businesses and urging customers to come along with them to say namaste to him. The slogans that the motorcyclists and the campaigners with Subhendu Adhikari are raising still cry out vengeance.                     
	Seth has been spending sleepless nights, the CPM candidate says, for three years now. Because he is on a hit-list of obstructionists and Maoists.        
	The obstructionists are saying that his dream project of a chemical hub in Nayachar will turn women infertile. What a canard! says Seth. This dream project of another new Haldia is a promise that should make the 60,000 workers of Haldia and their families stand by him and the CPM. Surely that will see him through to Parliament again, he feels.         
	Seth can perhaps look forward to restful days ahead after May 7 when Tamluk votes and dreamless sleep after May 16 when the results are out.

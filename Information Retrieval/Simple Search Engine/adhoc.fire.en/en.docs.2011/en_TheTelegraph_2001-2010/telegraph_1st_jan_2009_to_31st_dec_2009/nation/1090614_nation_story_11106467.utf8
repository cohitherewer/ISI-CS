	Bhubaneswar, June 13: A part of a goods train was derailed early this morning as suspected Maoists blew up four feet of railway tracks near Chandiposh station in Sundargarh district, about 50km from Rourkela. There were no casualties.        
	The guard of the train, K.R.N. Nair, was lucky to have survived even though his cabin was dislodged from the tracks in the impact of the blast, the railway superintendent of police, R.K. Bal, said.        
	Maoists were observing a bandh in five neighbouring states of Orissa, Bihar and Jharkhand.        
	Train services were restored on the route, primarily used for transporting minerals, after the tracks were repaired within three hours.

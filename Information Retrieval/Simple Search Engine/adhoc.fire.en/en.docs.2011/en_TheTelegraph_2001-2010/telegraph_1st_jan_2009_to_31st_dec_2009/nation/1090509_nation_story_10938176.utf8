The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Left steps up Nitish chase
                                                                                                               Left steps up Nitish chase
          JAYANTH JACOB       
	New Delhi, May 8: In the run-up to the poll results, the Left is busy with two key tasks: hunting for new allies and holding on to the current ones.        
	Still high on having got the Biju Janata Dal over to its side, the communists are moving into top gear to catch Nitish Kumar too, although Left leaders reckon that a deal probably hinges on the May 16 results.        
	The Left has many leaders who are close to both Janata Dal (United) president Sharad Yadav and Bihar chief minister Nitish. Sources said CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan and CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury were working on Nitish.        
	Even Naveen Patnaik and Nitish are good friends, a Left leader said.        
	Its not known whether, when CPM general secretary Prakash Karat met the Orissa chief minister today, they discussed a possible role by Naveen in prodding Nitish closer to the third alternative.         
	The chief minister-woos-chief minister formula had worked during an earlier attempt to lure away an NDA partner  when Bengals Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had helped persuade Naveen to dump the BJP.        
	The Left fears that if the Congress wins 20 seats more than its current tally of 153, it might be able to cobble together a majority, shattering the communists third front dreams.        
	Left leaders are also unsure how many of their allies might be tempted to switch loyalties when the Big Two  the Congress and the BJP  get down to ally-hunting in earnest after May 16.        
	The Telugu Desam cannot line up with the Congress because of its regional compulsions, but Left sources are not sure they can say the same thing about the ADMK.        
	The ADMKs main opponent is the DMK, not the Congress. Even the Janata Dal (Secular) can take refuge under the excuse that the BJP is a bigger and more immediate enemy than the Congress, a Left leader said.        
	On the other hand, if the numbers are favourable, the Left envisages UPA partners like the Nationalist Congress Party and the Lok Janshakti Party switching sides.         
	There will be a new realignment of political forces after the elections. We are appealing to all non-BJP, non-Congress parties to join the alternative policy platform with us, CPM politburo member S. Ramachandran Pillai said.

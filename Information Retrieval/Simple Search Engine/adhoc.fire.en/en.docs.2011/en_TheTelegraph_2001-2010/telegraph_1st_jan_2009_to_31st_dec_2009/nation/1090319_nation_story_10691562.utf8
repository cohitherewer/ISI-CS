The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | If its a crutch, it has to be Katrina
                                                                                                               If its a crutch, it has to be Katrina
  - Name coaxed out of Jhas mouth          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Politics calling? Katrina Kaif on the set of the film Rajniti                                        
	New Delhi, March 18: Prakash Jha does not need Bollywood stars as crutches but Katrina Kaif would not be a bad catch.        
	The filmmaker-turned-politician, named the Lok Janshakti Party candidate from Bettiah in Bihar, was today practically forced by reporters to concede that he would not mind if the attractive star campaigned for him.        
	She is welcome to campaign if she wants to, Jha said of the actress of his film Rajniti, in which Katrinas character is supposed to resemble Sonia Gandhi.        
	Soon after Ram Vilas Paswan made the announcement, Jha, dressed in a kurta-pyjama, was bombarded with questions on which star he would like to catch votes for him. When reporters persistently put Katrinas name in his mouth, Jha finally gave in.        
	It is, however, unlikely that Katrina will campaign for Jha. Both Jha and his party boss Paswan are against the glamour quotient in politics.        
	We are a socialist party and would not like to show stars campaigning, Paswan said later.        
	Besides touching on Katrina, Jha talked about his foray into politics and sent out a message to actors aspiring for a career in politics.        
	I have some advice for film stars: politics is very serious business. Only those who want to and can work for the people should enter politics.        
	Many saw his statement as a possible jibe at Govindas stint as Congress MP from Mumbai North, but Jha did not elaborate.        
	Talking of himself, he added: My purpose in entering politics is a natural extension of my work the kind of films I have made and the work I want to do.        
	In 2003, Jha had made the Ajay Devgan-starrer Gangajal  on the Bhagalpur blindings  in which the villain goes by the name of Sadhu Yadav. There were protests in Bihar after the films release because RJD chief Lalu Prasads brother-in-law shares the same name.        
	The real Sadhu may, ironically, turn out to be Jhas rival in Bettiah. Sadhu was furious after Lalu denied him a ticket yesterday, and reports say he is planning to contest from a seat in West Champaran.        
	The Bettiah ticket came Jhas way  he claims he has worked both in East and West Champaran  after Paswan and Lalu struck a deal. Raghunath Jha of the RJD asked Paswan to take Bettiah and give him Valmikinagar.        
	Paswan was briefly caught in a controversy over his son Chirag getting roles in three films because of Jhas influence. The LJP boss has denied the charge, saying his son was competent enough to get roles on his own.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Mukherjee at the news conference in New Delhi on Sunday. Picture by Ramakant Kushwaha                                  
	New Delhi, April 5: The Congress today brought out a report card on the Left Fronts 32-year poor rule in Bengal but stuck to the post-poll golden rule that everything is possible in politics.         
	If you (the Left) could not deliver in one state, can the people of India trust a third front under your leadership and hand over the country to you? PTI quoted Congress leader Pranab Mukherjee as saying.        
	The document said the Left Front had failed to tackle the problems of health and nutrition, had not stemmed the high dropout rates in schools and fared badly in the implementation of the mid-day meal scheme as well as in employment generation.        
	Bengal also had the countrys poorest district  Murshidabad.         
	Mukherjee, incidentally, is an MP from the district, Jangipur being his constituency.         
	Asked what he had to say about this distinction of Murshidabad as an MP, he said: The 16 lakh people of the constituency will answer for it.        
	After placing the 12-page document before journalists at the AICC headquarters, he added: You can draw your own conclusions.        
	Mukherjee, who is the Bengal Congress chief, said the state was unique  the same political front had been in power for over 30 long years and still development was so poor.        
	He, however, did not rule out a post-election alliance with the Left. I am not an astrologer, I cannot predict what is going to happen. In the realm of politics, everything is possible, he said.        
	Asked about the Gorkhaland statehood demand, Mukherjee said Bengal would not be divided.        
	The third front constituents, Mukherjee said, are like six characters in a play in search of one scriptwriter. My conviction is that having a limited number of seats and very little presence at the national level and being unable to project a prime ministerial candidate, they dont have national impact.         
	He said the UPA was not disintegrating, as its critics said, but the Left today saw in the report card signs of the Congresss desperation.        
	CPM central committee member Nilotpal Basu said: The desperation in the Congress has become so overwhelming that a person as senior as Pranab Mukherjee is talking about it. The party has forgotten that its an election where it would have come up with a progress card of the UPA. This is the government under whose tenure 1.8 lakh farmers committed suicide in the country.        
	In Rajkot, CPM politburo member Brida Karat lashed out at the Congress-led UPA government, alleging that it was responsible for the economic crisis in the country.        
	It is unfortunate that those entrusted with the job of looking after the countrys economic situation have failed completely in doing their duty, she said. The UPA government is responsible for the current economic situation in India. According to the export and manufacturing associations, over one crore workers are jobless today because of the slowdown.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Poonam to campaign, eye on future 
                                                                                                               Poonam to campaign, eye on future 
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                                            
	Mumbai, April 1: The parallels are many  young blood, fathers legacy, a brother who has had a brush with the law and family tragedy. But Poonam Mahajan may not be able to do a Priya Dutt yet.        
	Poonam knows it, too, but is looking ahead. My party is not backing me, so I am backing out of the electoral fray. But I will campaign. It will help me hone my speeches for the future. That is the least I can attempt to achieve, given that my fathers CD on the art of making political speeches is still the hottest selling item at the BJP headquarters, she said.        
	The 28-year-old believes local leaders, not the BJPs top brass, have let her down. Nine of 11 members of the BJP central executive backed me. But locally, I was almost an outcaste, she said.        
	But the speeches she speaks of practising might come in use soon: she claims the party top brass has asked her to prepare for the Maharashtra polls, due later this year.        
	A general secretary of the BJPs youth wing, the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, in Maharashtra, Poonam had made no secret of her political ambitions.         
	But now, sulking after she was denied the seats of her choice, Poonam has declined an offer made by her party to take on Priya Dutt in another constituency and decided to back off.        
	Asked why she had refused to contest from Mumbai North Central, state BJP general secretary Vinod Tawde had a terse answer: She seems to prefer fighting men more than women.         
	Poonam had wanted to take on another young Congress leader, the 30-year-old Milind Deora, from the prestigious Mumbai South, where she lives. Her other choice was Mumbai North East, her late fathers pocket borough.        
	After being denied these seats, Poonam visited Raj Thackerays home last week, setting off speculation she might join his Maharashtra Navnirman Sena.        
	BJP leaders saw the move as an attempt to put pressure. She cannot hold the party to ransom and dictate terms. She is not Pramod Mahajan. She is his daughter and a political greenhorn. She should take what is offered to her or leave it, said another senior Maharashtra BJP leader.        
	Poonam claims she refused Mumbai North Central when it became clear that Mahesh Jethmalani was the most favoured candidate. It seemed they (the BJPs state leaders) wanted to play around with me. I am not going to lend myself to that.        
	She suggests she would be fighting a losing battle in Priyas seat, North Central. It comprises largely Muslim, Catholic and north Indian voters. I may not be the most suitable candidate (there). The BJP doesnt expect to win that seat from Priya. Why should I become a scapegoat by contesting just for the sake of it? she asks.        
	Controversy over Poonams candidature has brought into the open the deep rift between the pro and anti-Pramod Mahajan factions in the state unit of the BJP.        
	Party insiders say many local leaders find Poonam arrogant and chafe at her alleged habit of flashing her proximity to central bigwigs and bypassing the state functionaries.        
	She is also a tool of Gopinath Munde (her uncle), who is keen to regain his clout after Pramodjis death. But equations have changed here since Pramodji and so has the power structure, said a BJP source.        
	Munde, an ex-chief minister and Pramods brother-in-law, is contesting from Beed in Maharashtra.

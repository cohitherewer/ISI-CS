          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Amar , Rahul                          
	Lucknow, Oct. 15: The Samajwadi Party is hitting out at the Congress with borrowed phrases and techniques ahead of the 12 by-elections in the state next month.        
	Amar Singh has echoed the Left in scoffing at Rahul Gandhis Dalit picnic and Mulayam Singh Yadav recycled L.K. Advanis failed slogan of weakest Prime Minister while mimicking Manmohan Singh .        
	The Samajwadis seem afraid that a resurgent Congress might dent their Other Backward Classes and minority vote banks in the November 7 by-elections to 11 Assembly seats and the Lok Sabha constituency of Firozabad.        
	Party general secretary Amar yesterday described Rahuls visits to the huts of Dalits as mere political picnics, a slightly reworded version of the Lefts charge that Congress leaders were indulging in Dalit political tourism.        
	On Monday, party president Mulayam had termed Manmohan Singh the weakest Prime Minister. At a meeting in Lucknow, Mulayam, mimicking the Prime Ministers voice, said: Hum kaise kursi par aaye pata nahin, kaha gaya ki baith jao to hum baith gaye (I dont know how I came to occupy the Prime Ministers chair, I was asked to sit in it and I did).        
	Mulayam said the Prime Ministers weakness was eroding the integrity of the country. Terrorists from Pakistan were entering through the China-Nepal route and fake currency was being pumped in.        
	Advanis weakest Prime Minister barb during the Lok Sabha poll campaign, however, had appeared to backfire at the booths.        
	The reason for Mulayams anger is that despite his support to the UPA government, the Congress did not make the Samajwadis a part of the decision-making process. The Congress has also failed to initiate action against chief minister Mayavati, Mulayams arch-enemy.        
	Amar, who had earlier called Rahul a kid in politics, said the Congress had failed to improve the plight of Dalits and the poor despite being in power for years at the Centre.        
	Congress leaders are these days enjoying picnics at the houses of Dalits, he told a rally at Firozabad.

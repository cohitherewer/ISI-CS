The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Fresh autopsy cry in PF scam case
                                                                                                               Fresh autopsy cry in PF scam case
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                          Ashutosh Asthana                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 19: The Ghaziabad Bar Association today moved the Supreme Court seeking a second post-mortem in the mysterious death of a prime accused and witness in the multi-crore provident fund scam involving top judges.        
	Initial post-mortem reports on Ashutosh Asthana, found unconscious in Ghaziabad jail and later declared dead in hospital, suggested death by poisoning. Jail authorities had claimed that it was a case of suicide.        
	The scam, involving at least 13 high court judges and one from the Supreme Court, is related to fraudulent PF withdrawals from the Ghaziabad court treasury between 1995 and 2001.         
	The Supreme Court had directed the CBI to probe the scam and report back to it. The agency is yet to complete its probe.         
	The death of Asthana, who was in judicial custody, is ironical as the apex court itself has laid down guidelines to prevent custodial deaths and inhuman treatment of undertrials in many of its judgments over the years.        
	The bar, on whose plea the apex court had directed the CBI inquiry, has raised doubts over the suicide claim and demanded that a special investigation team probe Asthanas death. It has said the second post-mortem should be done in Delhi.         
	If he (Asthana) has not been cremated, he should not be. If he has been cremated, a second post-mortem should be conducted of his viscera, said Anil Divan, the bars counsel.        
	Justice D.K. Jain, the apex court judge who heads the special bench dealing with the PF scam, asked the CBI counsel to find out whether Asthanas body had been cremated. The matter will be heard again tomorrow.         
	The bar also claimed Asthanas family had feared threats to his life. Asthana himself had wanted to be shifted to a separate jail barracks because of this, the bar said in its application quoting his brother Shishir.         
	Shishir has alleged that his brother was murdered at the behest of the judges allegedly involved in the scam, the bar told the apex court.        
	In his confession before a magistrate, Asthana had said several sitting and retired judges of district courts and superior courts had benefited from the PF withdrawals. He claimed several judicial officers had also benefited and that the withdrawals were made with the sanction of their superiors.        
	In some instances, huge amounts were withdrawn from the PF fund of Class III and IV employees, sometimes even twice a year, in the name of fictitious persons. The CBI is probing the claims.         
	The apex court has sought a status report on the investigation and the case is likely to come up for hearing in November.         
	The FIR lodged by Ghaziabad police in the case names 82 lower staff for allegedly siphoning off over Rs 7 crore from the PF corpus.         
	But no FIR has been registered against the sitting Supreme Court judge, seven sitting high court judges and 10 serving district judges.        
	However, six retired high court judges and two retired district judges have been named.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Phalcon first in Antony term II 
                                                                                                               Phalcon first in Antony term II 
          SUJAN DUTTA                          A Phalcon AWACS aircraft                                  
	New Delhi, May 24: A huge aircraft with a radome mounted on top is scheduled to land at the Jamnagar air force base in Gujarat within hours of A.K. Antony taking over as the defence minister for the second time tomorrow.        
	The landing of the Phalcon Airborne Early Warning and Control System or AWACS on Indian soil is far more important to the armed forces than the reoccupation of the South Block ministerial office that overlooks Vijay Chowk and Rajpath.         
	When Antony is informed of the arrival of the AWACS  he is likely to be at the formal induction ceremony on Tuesday in Delhi  he will be acutely aware that it is bad as well as good news.        
	The bad news first: it is yet another delayed delivery.         
	The AWACS deal, worth $1.1 billion for three systems, was contracted in 2004. The first of the aircraft was due in 2007. Antony himself took over from Pranab Mukherjee in October 2006. The first system is only arriving now. Three additional systems are being ordered. Deliveries are scheduled till 2012.        
	The good news: The air force has finally got it.         
	The system is a complex force multiplier. The Israeli surveillance and avionics technologies have been integrated on an Ilyushin-76 aircraft from Uzbekistan.        
	The radars and systems are said to be capable of arming the air force with capabilities to detect enemy missiles, aircraft, troop movement and enable it to snoop on enemy communication. The AWACS will pass on information to the ground and the air forces own aircraft. All of this, IAF sources say, it can do while flying within Indian airspace.        
	In simple terms, the Phalcon can monitor movements 400km inside Pakistani territory and even in eastern Afghanistan while flying within Indian airspace, the sources say. The aircraft are to be based in Agra.        
	The arrival of the AWACS when Antony takes over holds out the promise that his second term will see the translation of deals into deliveries. But Antony has himself held back on contracting big-ticket purchases in his first term, either for political reasons or because of the hint of scandals.        
	Towards the end of his first term, though, he uncharacteristically backed a deal on medium-range, surface-to-air missiles with Israel, despite opposition from the Left.         
	If this is an indicator that Antony will be more decisive  especially because the Left is not a factor any more  the armed forces have reason to hope that the minister will push through with the moves he has initiated.        
	The biggest among these is the 126 multi-role combat aircraft deal for the air force that could be upwards of $10.5 billion. Six competitors  the Lockheed Martin (F-16 Super Viper), Boeing (F-18 Super Hornet), SAAB (Gripen), EADS (Eurofighter), Dassault Aviation (Rafale), RAC MiG (MiG-35)  are in the race. The trials are to begin in a month from now.        
	The IAFs combat strength has been dipping steadily. The need for the aircraft was first projected in 2001. Much older than the air forces fighter aircraft projection is the navys carrier deal.         
	The Admiral Gorshkov aircraft carrier (re-christened INS Vikramaditya), for which India has paid up front and for which Russia has demanded an additional $2.9 million, is still in the dock.         
	The negotiations over the new prices demanded by Russia are to be concluded in July.

	New Delhi, April 10: Fears of a blowback of the insurgency in Pakistan hitting India in Kashmir have mounted with infiltration bids in March nearly thrice the figure for the same month last year.        
	The army has also noted that the militants have demonstrated greater staying power, analysts in the security establishment have told The Telegraph.        
	The suspension of the US embassy in Islamabad today and the advisory issued to US citizens in Pakistan have further heightened tensions.        
	The warnings follow the attacks on Sri Lankan cricketers and the raid on the Manavan police training centre near Lahore, about 12km from the border with India.        
	The security analysts assessments are corroborated by Union home minister P. Chidambarams disclosure to a television channel last night that the threat level to India is pretty high, with four Pakistan-based terror outfits working in concert.        
	Earlier this week, reports from Kashmir quoting police sources said radio intercepts indicated Taliban elements were trying to enter India through the Line of Control.        
	We simply have to keep our powder dry. Make sure that we remain on high alert because four organisations are working in concert. That means the level of threat is pretty high, the home minister said. I dont think (we have) captured anyone to identify him as a Taliban (operative). All that we know is that there is a serious attempt to infiltrate into India.        
	The army, which para-dropped forces to counter the infiltration bid, also said it had made no such contact. A source in army headquarters said no evidence  such as documents, weapons or equipment and other tell-tale signs  had been found to show the militants they encountered in the Gurez sector were different from the Lashkar, Jaish-e-Mohammad or Hizbul Mujahideen activists that they regularly engage with in Kashmir.         
	The source said the infiltration attempts in March were mostly in eight areas: Uri, Baramula, Lolab, Kupwara, Kangan, Gurez, Hafruda forest and Wusan.         
	In many of these areas, the weather has been bad. For nearly four days, the army had to suspend operations because of heavy snow. At such times, militants are able to infiltrate if they have good guides.        
	Analysts point out that Pakistans Swat Valley  where a peace deal to implement the Islamic Shariat law brokered last month has now collapsed  got Talibanised in a blowback of the troubles in Afghanistan.         
	Similarly, a blowback of the pacy Talibanisation of Pakistan can take hold in parts of Jammu and Kashmir despite its Sufi ethos.        
	Army sources said the infiltrators had been attempting to cross over the Line of Control this year in larger groups. Their firepower and training has been more sophisticated. The army has been using special forces in its counter-infiltration grid. Commandos of the 1 Para of the army this week were dropped in the Hafruda forest after a tip-off on infiltrators in the Gurez sector.        
	These infiltrators were at first suspected to be Taliban, but there is no evidence yet to show that. The army has been expecting that infiltration and militant-sponsored violence will increase as the general elections draw closer.         
	Earlier this week, US special representative Richard Holbrooke said in New Delhi that for the first time in 60 years Pakistan, India and Afghanistan were faced with a common threat  the Taliban  and must confront it together.         
	The Taliban see Afghanistan and Pakistan as a seamless region over which they must hold sway. Their targeted areas of influence wash up along the Pakistan-India border and Kashmir and a blowback of the war between them and the US-Pakistani forces is inevitable, Indian analysts say. A greater involvement of India in Afghanistan, even without boots on the ground, drags Delhi deeper into that war.

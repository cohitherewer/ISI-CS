The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Fencing on Bangla zero line
                                                                                                               Fencing on Bangla zero line
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 28: The Centre will go ahead with a plan for barbed-wire fencing on the zero line of the border with Bangladesh, brushing aside Dhakas objections.         
	The decision was taken at a recent meeting held by Union home minister P. Chidambaram, who is to have asserted that India had every right to protect its borders from terrorists, insurgent groups and smugglers with bases in Bangladesh.        
	The home ministrys border management division has been asked to draw up the plan for such fencing, with concertina wires, on a priority basis in sensitive areas along the border in Tripura, Assam and Bengal, where the sites include Raiganj, Jalpaiguri and Siliguri. Another spot on the list is Kishanganj in Bihar.        
	Dhaka has argued that fortification on the zero line  a no-mans strip of land between the two borders  is not allowed under the Indira-Mujib accord of 1974 and says it must be done 150 yards from the line.        
	Security agencies believe the move will reduce smuggling sharply. Chidambaram is believed to have told the Border Security Force to assist the agency involved in the fencing.         
	Sources at the Bangladesh embassy in Delhi said they had no information from Dhaka about the zero line fencing.        
	Only 2,650km of the 4,095km porous border, in Bengal and the seven northeastern states, had been fenced till March this year, the government has told Parliament.

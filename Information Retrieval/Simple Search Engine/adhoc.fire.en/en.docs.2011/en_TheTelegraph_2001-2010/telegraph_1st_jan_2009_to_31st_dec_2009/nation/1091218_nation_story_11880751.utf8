          OUR BUREAU                          The delayed plane                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 17: Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs flight to Copenhagen was delayed by three hours today after a cargo van carrying his luggage and food rammed the aircraft on the engine side and left a visible dent.        
	Singh, scheduled to leave at 2.15pm, left on a standby Air India aircraft at 5.50pm, a source told The Telegraph.        
	Neither the Prime Minister nor any other passenger was inside the Boeing 747, named Agra, when the vans hydraulic lift hit the planes cargo door around 12.30pm.        
	Concerned that the aircrafts engine may have been damaged, security agencies told the Prime Ministers Office that his arrival at the technical area of Palam airport should be delayed.        
	The director of the Special Protection Group (SPG) and the secretary, security, were present when the mishap took place. Airport sources said the SPG surrounded the aircraft and awaited the arrival of Air India technical staff to ascertain the extent of the damage.        
	Civil aviation minister Praful Patel, who rushed to the airport, said a high-level inquiry by the directorate-general of civil aviation and Air India had been ordered. The Air India loader operating the hydraulic lift has been suspended.        
	Let the full inquiry report come, then we will know whether there was anything mala fide, the minister said, adding that the loader had enough experience of working with VVIP aircraft. After all we are all human.        
	After the decision to use the standby aircraft, named Khajuraho, the usual three-hour security drill to check the new plane began.        
	An Air India media release said: The departure timing had to be revised as the aircraft, earlier earmarked for the flight, was accidentally damaged while loading operations were on. It said Air India took immediate measures to provide an alternative aircraft.        
	This is the second mishap involving a VIP aircraft in a week. On December 9, the rotor blades of an air force Mi-17 helicopter carrying President Pratibha Patil hit a shed after landing at Bhubaneswar airport. The three rotor blades got twisted and the sheds asbestos roof was ripped off.

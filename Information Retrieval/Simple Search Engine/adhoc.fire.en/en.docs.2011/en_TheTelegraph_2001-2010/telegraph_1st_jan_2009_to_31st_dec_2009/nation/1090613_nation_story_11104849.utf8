The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Longer, improved job scheme on the cards 
                                                                                                               Longer, improved job scheme on the cards 
          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, June 12: From next year, the rural job scheme may offer more than 100 days work a year, and train beneficiaries in weaving or child care so they dont just have to build roads or dig canals.        
	The UPA government, encouraged by the poll dividends from its flagship scheme, wants to widen its scope. The decision to increase the number of workdays hasnt been finalised yet but the nature of work is certain to expand from unskilled to skilled, a rural development ministry official said.        
	Work under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme now includes digging canals and ponds, planting trees, drainage and irrigation jobs, water harvesting and the like. Next year, its expected to feature jobs  many of them women-friendly  like caring for the sick and poor in old-age homes and government shelters, maintaining school buildings and public toilets, even helping anganwadi workers.        
	We had asked other ministries and the states to send us suggestions by the end of this month. The response has been quick, the rural development ministry official said. A performance review committee formed by the ministry discussed many of the recommendations yesterday.        
	One suggestion the ministry is apprehensive about accepting is that the beneficiaries be allowed to work as labourers on paddy fields.        
	The ministry is hesitant about this since the paddy fields would mostly be in private hands, the official said. Government wages for work related to private property could open the way for much misuse of the scheme, he added.        
	Among the states that have sent their suggestions, Tripura has sought to include work in forests as well as government-owned fisheries, farms and orchards. Kerala has asked mainly for expansion into the service sector, such as care of the sick and elderly at government homes.        
	Andhra Pradesh wants the schemes beneficiaries to work as caretakers in government housing complexes and to build sea embankments.        
	The Union ministries have offered training programmes for the skilled jobs.         
	The textiles ministry has proposed to train 50 lakh people to enable them to get employment under the rural job scheme, the official said, adding the villagers would be taught skills like spinning and weaving.        
	The social justice ministry wants to train women so they can help anganwadi workers.        
	The government also plans to hire chartered accountants to audit all files related to the job scheme, from the level of the sarpanch to senior bureaucrats. The scheme, which allocated around Rs 30,000 crore in the last financial year, has faced charges of funds misuse.        
	Nothing has been finalised, but there is a proposal to bring in CAs to make the scheme more transparent and accountable, the official said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Indian? US burglars follow golden rule

	Oct. 17: Burglars with a keen appreciation for gold have targeted Indian and South Asian homes in a months-long series of daytime break-ins in Northern Virginia in the US.        
	The burglars are discerning. They have taken 22-karat pieces but left behind sterling silver and well-crafted costume jewellery. They have sifted through floor-length gowns lovingly stored in closets and plucked every custom-made sari threaded with gold and worth thousands, disdaining saris worth only hundreds.        
	Officers in Fairfax and Loudoun counties, and the homeowners themselves, have yet to figure out how the burglars so successfully identify houses with large gold caches.         
	Before they became victims, many of the families were strangers, and they and police have eliminated many of the obvious links: churches, temples, schools or even grocery stores where they could have been tracked.        
	Most of us didnt even know each other, said Raman Kumar, whose home in Centreville was among the earliest break-in sites. But here is the thing: If you know our customs, you know we carry a lot of gold.        
	Gold has been selling at more than $1,000 an ounce, and some of the break-ins have netted more than $100,000 worth of jewellery, victims reported.        
	A break-in on Thursday was the most recent of three cases in South Riding in Loudoun.        
	The unsolved crimes mirror a pattern of 93 burglaries in Houston, 37 in central Illinois and a handful outside St Paul, Minnesota.        
	There is targeting because of gold prices. Thats how we are talking about it, rather than ethnicity, said Fairfax police spokesperson Mary Ann Jennings.        
	Fairfax residents have grown increasingly angry and fearful about the crimes, complaining that the police were slow to recognise the trend.        
	Kumar said he was among those frustrated. Burglars broke through a basement window at his home on February 27 and stole heirloom gold jewellery. In a particularly insulting act, Kumar said, thieves stole a gold statue of Goddess Lakshmi. The thieves passed over laptop computers and other electronics.        
	Kumar began tracking word of other burglaries and spotlighting them on local Indian websites and Facebook groups. He said the groups had not uncovered a shared activity that would enable a burglar to scout them.        
	Vindhya Kommineni lost her most expensive saris made for her wedding, her wedding rings and a sterling dinner set that included gold inlay in an October 6 burglary that was one of two that day on a block in Fair Oaks. Not all of her gowns were taken, nor were all of her silver utensils.        
	I started thinking they must be carrying something with them that tests for gold, Kommineni said. If not, they have a very good eye.        
	She and her husband had installed a security system after hearing of the earlier Fairfax break-ins, she said, but their house was burgled anyway. Like most of the burglaries, the thieves entered by breaking rear doors and windows.        
	A few residents who work from home or were home during the day recounted having a woman knock loudly at their front door and, if they responded, being asked for directions to another street. At least one also saw a man in their backyard at the same time, wearing a work shirt and appearing to be checking utilities.

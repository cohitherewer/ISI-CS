          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 11: The vigilance department today registered criminal cases against nine persons  two mines operators and seven mines and forest department officials  in connection with the multi-crore mining scam in mineral-rich Keonjhar district.        
	Simultaneous raids were conducted on their offices and residences here and Joda in Keonjhar. The legal proceedings were taken up following a preliminary inquiry by the vigilance department, which confirmed illegal mining activities in Joda.        
	As a follow-up action on the report, the cases were registered against S.N. Das Mohapatra and S.R. Dash, who were claiming to have power of attorney of RB Thakur Mining Company and found to have undertaken mining operations illegally without forest and environment clearance.         
	Cases were booked against mines department joint directors Debendra Mishra and Ganeswar Mohanty, former mines deputy director Sasadhar Sahu, deputy director M.M. Biswal, mines officer Routray Murmu, forest range officer Dilip Behera and forest section officer Kamalakanta Pradhan for connivance with the illegal mines operators.        
	The preliminary report, which was submitted to the government on Friday, revealed that illegal mining was going on in Keonjhar district in connivance with officials of the mines and forest departments.        
	RB Thakur Mining Company, which was liquidated long ago, was allowed to guard the manganese mine area by the directorate of mines by violating norms, said the vigilance report. It also found evidence of illegal mining activities by the firm without forest clearance or pollution clearance.        
	The issue had rocked the Assembly during its recent budget session with the Opposition alleging that state exchequer had incurred a revenue loss of at least Rs 4,000 crore because of illegal mining activities and demanded a CBI probe into the alleged mining scam.        
	However, the Naveen Patnaik government had rejected the Opposition demand and ordered a vigilance inquiry into the Opposition allegations, which were later vindicated during the preliminary investigation by the vigilance.        
	On the allegation of corruption and showing undue official favour to private mine owners in illegal mining in Rudukela and Katasahi mines in Keonjhar district, case No. 35/09 has also been registered by the vigilance cell.

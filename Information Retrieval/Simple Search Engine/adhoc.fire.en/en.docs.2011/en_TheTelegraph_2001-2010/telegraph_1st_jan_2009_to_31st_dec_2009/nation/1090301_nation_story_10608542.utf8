	New Delhi, Feb. 28: New Delhi is worried about the trouble in Bangladesh spilling over into India, especially with 700-odd heavily armed Bangladesh Rifles mutineers still at large.        
	Some of the mutineers are expected to try and enter Indian territory, and Dhaka has asked New Delhi to disarm them and hand them over.         
	But security officials are more worried about fights breaking out near the border between the Bangladesh Army and BDR mutineers, many of whom are believed to be armed with rocket launchers.        
	India would not want such a conflagration near its borders. Besides, sources said, it was anyones guess how the 67,000-strong BDR might react in case of such trouble.        
	Some officials here suspect a role by Pakistans spy agency, the ISI, in the BDR mutiny, and therefore fear that the armed mutineers, if they get near the border, may not be well disposed towards India.        
	Sources said a former MP of the Opposition Bangladesh National Party (BNP) and at least three senior Bangladesh Army officers may have helped fan the mutiny. They said the officers included a disgruntled brigadier who believed that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed would block his promotion.        
	Security officials said though they had been keeping an eye on the BDRs simmering discontent since last month, none of them anticipated an eruption of this magnitude.        
	An intelligence source said a Jamaat-e-Islami hand too was likely in the mutiny, though its unclear what and how big a role the fundamentalist group had played.        
	Sources told The Telegraph the mutineers  who killed their director-general, Major General Shakil Ahmed, and his wife  also murdered a retired army colonel and his wife who were guests at Ahmeds residence at the BDRs Pilkhana headquarters.        
	The BSF is on high alert along the 4,095km international border. All BSF commandants are at the border.        
	The governments of the border states, including Bengal, are in constant touch with New Delhi.         
	The Bengal home secretary was in Delhi today to discuss the issue besides holding talks with the cabinet secretary on coastal security.

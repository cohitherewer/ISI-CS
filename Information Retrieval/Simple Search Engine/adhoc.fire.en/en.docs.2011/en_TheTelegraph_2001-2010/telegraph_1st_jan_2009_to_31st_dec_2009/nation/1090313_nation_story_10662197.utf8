          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 12: CPM and CPI central leaders were preparing to step in to break the deadlock over sharing Lok Sabha seats in Kerala after a split appeared imminent between the state units of the two Left parties.        
	A meeting of the states ruling LDF today failed to end the standoff. CPI state leaders will meet tomorrow to decide their course of action.        
	CPI sources said they were thinking of fielding candidates in all 20 Lok Sabha seats, and withdrawing party ministers from the state cabinet if the CPM remained adamant.         
	The CPI has being contesting in four seats in Kerala, including Ponnani. There was an understanding that Ponnani will have a CPI-backed Independent. But the CPM announced a candidate as a Left-backed Independent. They are now saying the CPIs share is just three seats, it is unacceptable, said a CPI leader.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Amateurs give theatre lifeline
                                                                                                               Amateurs give theatre lifeline
          LALMOHAN PATNAIK                              
	Cuttack, March 8: More than two decades after professional artistes and the administration turned their backs on Annapurna Theatre, an amateur group remains steadfast in their mission to keep the citys historic landmark alive.         
	Annapurna Theatre was inaugurated 76 years ago and went on to become the cradle of Oriya theatre. The institution closed in mid eighties and was subsequently abandoned by its so-called fans and the administration.         
	A group of amateur artistes, formed in 2006, have, however, continued to stage plays in the theatre and is trying to boost their slogan  witness plays, save theatre.         
	The group, under the banner of Annapurna TheatreB, for three years now has been staging plays every four weeks, the last being Hello Hai Bye Corporator, staged on Saturday. It was difficult to begin with as the wooden stage was virtually collapsing, the roof was missing and so were the chairs. But now Annapurna has a concrete stage and plastic chairs have been put in with help from individuals, said Yugaprakash Kanungo, the president of Annapurna Theatre-B.         
	Our labour has not gone unnoticed. Audiences are now gradually showing interest, in fact, we got a full house when Hello Hai Bye Corporator was staged, he added. The group in an interesting one coming from all professions, coming together by their love for Annapurna and theatre. It is too important a landmark to be ignored, said Raghunath Acharya, the groups co-director.         
	The collapse of one of the doors at Annapurnas arched entrance was a defining moment for us in January 2006, recalls Artatrana Das, a playwright. It was what made the crew get together and get going toward restoration path.        
	The artistes had started off with Bai Mana Ho, on April 29, 2006, dealing with the Kalinga Nagar clash as its backdrop. They have since then staged some of the popular plays such as Jantrana, based on the problem of child labour, Daktar Babu, based on plight of patients in private clinics and Cuttack-Police Encounter on the 29th of every month.        
	The group also staged a marathon of six plays without a break in 510 minutes.

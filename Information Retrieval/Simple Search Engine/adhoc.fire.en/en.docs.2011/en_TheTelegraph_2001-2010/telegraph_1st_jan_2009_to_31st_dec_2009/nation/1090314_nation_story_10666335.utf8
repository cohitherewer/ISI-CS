          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Triveni at a hospital in Guntur on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	Hyderabad, March 13: A 20-year-old agricultural engineering student drank hair dye in shame after college seniors allegedly forced her to disrobe and dance in public yesterday.        
	M. Triveni, a first-year student, regained consciousness last night. She was rushed to hospital in the morning after some students found her lying still in her hostel room for a prolonged period of time.        
	The incident at Government Agriculture Engineering College in Bapatla, 320km from Hyderabad, is the second case of ragging to come to light this week. A 19-year-old medical student of a Himachal college died of multiple head fractures and brain haemorrhage after allegedly being beaten up by seniors on Monday.        
	Triveni has named five senior female students in her statement to members of a college standing committee who visited her today.        
	The traumatised girl this afternoon spoke to her parents, who live in Guntur town 110km from her college.        
	The ragging was both obscene and vulgar and I am ashamed to describe it, she is believed to have told her parents. Reports, however, said she took the extreme step of drinking hair dye  some say nail polish or pesticide  after she was forced to dance nude.        
	Y.V.S. Prabhakar, the doctor who treated her at Amravati Trauma Centre, said he had been worried if Triveni would regain consciousness when he first saw her.        
	They brought the girl to me. She had apparently consumed a hair-dye solution. Her face and neck were swollen and we thought we would lose her. It was close. Fortunately, she came back, he said.        
	Trivenis father M. Ramana, an Andhra government employee, said she had been complaining about ragging since the first day of college, but it had got worse when she joined the second semester after the Shivratri break.        
	His daughter had, however, forced him to keep mum fearing her studies would be affected, he said. When she went back, they told her the first semester was different and that ragging would be at a new level from now on. They called her to the terrace and harassed her, Ramana said.        
	All parents know about this, but are concerned about their childs future and keep quiet. But I dont want this to happen to any other student.        
	Guntur district collector Jayesh Ranjan said he had spoken to the principal and teachers of the college. Triveni, known to be a reserved person, had failed three exams because she was too traumatised by the continuing ragging to study, he added.        
	The principal, T.V. Satyanarayana, said: We have set up an inquiry committee to find out the truth behind this.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Srinagar, Oct. 27: Security has been stepped up for Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs visit to Kashmir tomorrow after inputs that Hizb-ul Mujahideen will try to avenge the encounter death of a top commander.        
	The Prime Minister is scheduled to inaugurate an 18km stretch of the Kashmir rail project and address a public meeting at Qazigund, 70km from Srinagar.        
	Police sources said the Hizb-ul leadership in Pakistan-occupied Kashmirs Muzaffarabad had asked its cadres to increase attacks on security forces after yesterdays killing of Mohammad Sadiq Dar alias Saqib.         
	Saqib, considered next only to the Muzaffarabad-based Hizb-ul chief Syed Salahuddin, was killed along with two other militantsin south Kashmirs Shopian.        
	Saqib, active for 14 years, was trying to revive the Hizb-ul, which has lost many of its senior leaders in recent years to security forces, police said.        
	The Hizb directive has more to do with the loss of the Hizb-ul commander than the visit of the Prime Minister. Security has been stepped up across the Valley. Patrolling has been increased. Hundreds of security men have been deployed in Qazigund and the area is being sanitised, a source said.        
	Kashmir police chief Farooq Ahmad said all preparations for the visit had been made. All arrangements are in place and there is nothing to worry, he said.        
	The Valley today shut down in response to a two-day strike call by Hurriyat hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani. Todays call was to mark the 62th year of the Indian armys arrival in Kashmir on October 27, 1947. Tomorrows strike is to protest the Prime Ministers visit.        
	In Srinagar, most of the shops and business establishments remained closed, with only a handful of private vehicles on the roads.

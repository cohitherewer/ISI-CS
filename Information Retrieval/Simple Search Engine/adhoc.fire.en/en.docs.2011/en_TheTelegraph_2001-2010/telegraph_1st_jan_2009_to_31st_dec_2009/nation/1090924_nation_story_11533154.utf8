The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Kandhamal toll climbs to 11
                                                                                                               Kandhamal toll climbs to 11
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 23: Two more patients today died of suspected food poisoning that has gripped the tribal-dominated Gudrika village in Kandhamal district, taking the toll to 11.        
	Two people died at MKCG Medical College and Hospital in Berhampur this morning. Both were adults, said Jatin Patnaik, the Kandhamal chief district medical officer.         
	The two were shifted to MKCG hospital yesterday after their condition worsened at Daringbadi hospital where they were admitted earlier. As many as 18 persons are still undergoing treatment at the Daringbadi hospital. The news of the deaths triggered panic among families with most fleeing villages out of fear.        
	Initially, the disease was suspected to be food poisoning following consumption of wild mushrooms. Later, when more people became victims with symptoms of high fever and vomiting, doctors suspected it to be a case of cerebral malaria.        
	Yesterday, a four-member expert team from MKCG Medical College and Hospital reached the village to ascertain the cause.         
	The team, however, rejected cerebral malaria as the cause as patients tested negative for malaria. Doctors, however, believe that food poisoning could be a cause.         
	The cause will be known only after the patients go through a battery of tests. We will submit a report to the government in two days, the CDMO said.         
	Meanwhile, the government has decided to send a fresh team of doctors to the village from Berhampur and Bhubaneswar. A team will rush to Gudikia from Berhampur and Bhubaneswar to investigate the case, said health minister Prasanna Acharya.        
	Doctors are still camping at the village and there is no cause of panic as no fresh cases have been detected, said Patnaik.         
	Also, four mobile health units have been pressed into service under Saramula and Gadapur panchayats to meet eventualities. Besides, field staff have been engaged to sensitise people, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Probe into US bribes already on: PMO
                                                                                                               Probe into US bribes already on: PMO
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 13: The government has sought to allay Opposition allegations of inaction on alleged payoffs to public sector concerns by US companies, saying it had acted swiftly on information and sought a probe in each case.         
	Inquiries had been ordered into all charges way back in June and we have asked departments concerned to expedite their probe, a source in the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) said today. There can be no truth to insinuations that we have been sitting idle on this information or shielding anyone.        
	In a letter to the Prime Ministers principal secretary, T.K.A. Nair, in May, Meera Shankar, Indian ambassador to Washington, had flagged allegations of illegal payoffs by US firms. The letter concerned illegal payments to officials of the Indian Navy, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, the Indian Railways, the Central Insecticides Board and the revenue department.        
	The US companies involved have been booked under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of the US, according to Shankars letter.        
	The BJP had yesterday released Shankars letter and questioned the governments silence on the matter, saying it amounts to shielding the corrupt. This means the government does only pep talk on the issue of corruption.        
	Contesting the BJPs allegation, a source in the PMO said: Action taken reports (ATRs) into all allegations had been sought from departments concerned in August itself, each case will be thoroughly looked into.        
	The sources said ambassador Shankars letter had been received at a time the country was on the verge of the general elections. But as soon as the new government settled down, this issue got the attention it deserved, and action was initiated, one of the sources said.        
	The agriculture ministry, the sources added, had already gone to the CBI in respect of alleged illegal payments to the Central Insecticides Board by the Dow Agro Science Private Limited, and a formal investigation was on.         
	The agriculture ministry is already seized of the matter relating to improper payment allegedly made by De-Nocil, now known as Dow Agro Sciences India Pvt Ltd, to the officials of the Central Insecticides Board, Faridabad, a PMO source said.         
	In all other cases, we have asked for the ATRs to be expeditiously submitted so that follow-up action can be taken, the source said.        
	The CPM today said that US firms accused of bribing Indian officials should be blacklisted and those who took money punished.

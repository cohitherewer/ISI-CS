The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Delhi seeks UK aid for education 
                                                                                                               Delhi seeks UK aid for education 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 12: India is seeking financial and technical assistance from the UKs Department for International Development (DFID) in running its ambitious scheme to universalise secondary education.         
	The human resource development (HRD) ministry is in consultations with the DFID to firm up an agreement for the UK departments participation in the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA), government officials have told The Telegraph.         
	The British department has been partnering the ministry in running the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA)  aimed at universalising primary education  since 2003.         
	But with the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan scheduled to slowly phase out over the next five years, the government is keen not to lose out on the expertise of the UK department, sources said.         
	The consultations with the British department on the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan will principally revolve around finalising the extent and quality of assistance that the UK body can provide India, the sources said.         
	The Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan, the single largest education scheme launched under the UPA regime, aims to achieve a gross enrolment rate (GER) of 75 per cent for classes IX and X by 2014. The GER for these classes is 53 per cent at present.         
	The scheme aims at achieving universal access to secondary schooling by the end of the 12th Five Year Plan (2017) and universal retention by 2020.         
	The British department has spent over 350 million (around Rs 2,800 crore) on Indian education since 2003 covering a number of schemes.         
	Of this, 150 million (around Rs 400 crore) have been committed to the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan alone while another 35 million have been allocated for the Mahila Samakhya programme  for empowering rural women through education.         
	The UK departments contribution to the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyans funding is just a tenth of the amount India allocated this year in its annual budget for the scheme  Rs 11,940 crore.         
	Of Indias allocation for 2009-10, Rs 4,250 crores is the budgetary allocation and the remaining Rs 7,690 crore is sanctioned from the Prarambhik Shiksha Kosh  the fund collecting the 2 per cent education cess.         
	Indias 2009-10 allocation for the secondary education plan  this is the first year of the scheme  is Rs 1,143 crore.         
	But more than money, what the DFID brings to the table is its expertise  in training programmes, management and other technical assistance, a government official said.         
	The UK secondary schooling system is rated highly by academicians and educationists across the world.         
	Educationists here have often cited the British common schooling system for secondary education as an example to emulate through the right to education law. State-run schools for children between 3 and 18 cater to 93 per cent of all children in the UK.

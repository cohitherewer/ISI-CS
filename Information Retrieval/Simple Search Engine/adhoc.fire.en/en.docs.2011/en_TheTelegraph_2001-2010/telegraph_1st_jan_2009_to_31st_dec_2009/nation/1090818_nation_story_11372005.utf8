The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Drought on Delhi lips
                                                                                                               Drought on Delhi lips
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 17: The Centre today said drought has set in, prompting the Congress to convene a meeting of the partys highest decision-making body to discuss the issue ahead of elections in several states.        
	(The) group of ministers will meet on a regular basis and that the ground reality is that the drought has set in, an official statement quoted finance minister Pranab Mukherjee as saying.        
	But the finance minister added: Let us not press the panic button, we need to create confidence that the situation can be overcome.        
	Echoing him, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh asked chief ministers not to panic, saying the government had enough experience in handling droughts.        
	There is no need to panic as we have a better understanding of how to handle a crisis like drought, the Prime Minister said at the special session on drought at the chief ministers meeting on internal security.        
	Agriculture minister Sharad Pawar said nine states  Assam, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Manipur, Nagaland, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh  had declared drought, partly or wholly. He urged the chief ministers to start relief operations immediately.        
	Sources said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and finance minister Pranab Mukherjee would brief the Congress Working Committee members at the August 19 meeting and their submissions supplemented with reports from general secretaries in drought-affected states.        
	Insiders said the Congress was worried as Assembly elections were expected soon in Maharashtra, Haryana, Jharkhand and Arunachal Pradesh.        
	Congress sources said they were not too pleased with the Centres response on the issues so far. Things like stockpiling food, ensuring proper distribution and banning exports are not enough. The government needs to think in an unconventional way, a source said without explaining what he meant by unconventional.        
	Some Congress said the governments hands were tied as NCP leader Pawar was in charge of food and agriculture, the nodal ministries for handling crises like drought and price spiral.        
	The CWC is likely to press for amendments to the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act so that the government can crack down on commodity trading and for the early tabling of the food security law in Parliament.

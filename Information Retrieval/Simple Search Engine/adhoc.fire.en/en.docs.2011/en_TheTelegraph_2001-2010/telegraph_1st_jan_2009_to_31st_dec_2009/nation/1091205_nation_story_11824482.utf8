          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Srinagar, Dec. 4: A moderate Hurriyat leader known to be a supporter of talks with Delhi was attacked and critically injured outside his home in Srinagar this evening.        
	Fazal Haq Qureshi heads the Peoples Political Front that is part of the Hurriyat led by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq.         
	Police said Qureshi was shot, but doctors at Sher-e-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, where he was being operated upon tonight, said a CT scan had revealed brain damage but no bullets. He is critical, said hospital director Dr Abdul Hameed Zargar.        
	Late tonight, an outfit called al Nasreen claimed responsibility for the attack.        
	Qureshi appears to have been targeted for supporting the recent talks announced by home minister P. Chidambaram. Earlier, Qureshi, who is widely respected by the separatists, was part of a Hurriyat delegation that had held dialogue with former deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani.

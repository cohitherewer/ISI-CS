The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CPM admits own arrogance 
                                                                                                               CPM admits own arrogance 
          JAYANTH JACOB                              
	New Delhi, June 26: The CPM appears to have accepted the widespread charge of arrogance against the party in Bengal, partly blaming this for its Lok Sabha poll defeat in the state.        
	It has also conceded that the peoples party known for its close networking with the rural population and skill at mass mobilisation had lost its touch with the people  leading to an erosion in credibility.        
	Inactivity of some members, malpractices, bureaucratic attitude and arrogance contributed to the defeat in Bengal, says the self-critical poll review adopted at the partys June 20-21 central committee meeting in New Delhi.        
	Also blamed are a mere formal approach in our contacts (with) the people and a mechanical attitude, reluctance, lack of credibility  fear of facing questions and avoiding daily contact with the people even during the elections.        
	The Bengal CPM will take up these organisational and government-level lapses at two separate meetings and try to find remedies.        
	Some of the points mentioned in the review about what went wrong in Bengal are:        
	The ministers, party leadership, frontal organisations, and party-held panchayats and civic bodies lacked awareness of the need to increase initiatives to address peoples problems. Instead, there was too much dependence on the administration        
	If some demands of the people are not legitimate, this should be patiently explained to them. This was not done        
	The party neglected the task of working among  and organising  the peasantry, rural poor and workers in the unorganised sector in rural and urban areas        
	It failed to study the nature of class relations, particularly in the countryside, and the changes that have come about in these relations (the report does not explain the specifics)        
	Sections of Muslims got estranged because they felt they were being denied access to education, jobs and opportunities for advancement        
	The party failed to remove the fears of land acquisition among sections of farmers        
	The Rs 5,100-crore fiscal stimulus package in the run-up to the elections did not have the desired impact. Those among the poor who were excluded from the Rs 2-a-kg rice scheme were left discontent.        
	For the reverses in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, the review has blamed the central committee (CC) and the politburo (PB).        
	The state secretariat (in Andhra) was against having an understanding with the TDP (Telugu Desam Party) and this was conveyed to the PB, the report says. Hence the responsibility for the alliance with the TDP was primarily of the PB/CC.        
	In Tamil Nadu, the state committee was evenly divided on an understanding with the AIADMK, so the matter was referred to the politburo, which cleared the alliance.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | On Net: Bengal school data
                                                                                                               On Net: Bengal school data
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, July 31: The latest school education statistics for every Bengal village may soon be accessible just by browsing a map.         
	The Bengal government is launching a graphic online database allowing access to the latest school education statistics of every village by clicking a mouse at the selected village on a map.         
	No other state has such a facility.         
	It is an idea we would want others too to look at. Anyone interested can get the latest statistical data on schools in any village just by zooming in on that village on a map, state school education secretary Vikram Sen told The Telegraph on the sidelines of a conference of state secretaries here.         
	The Bengal government has already completed collecting data from all villages in the districts of Bankura, Purulia and South Dinajpur, and is aiming at launching the project by September, Sen said.         
	School education data is currently collated at the district level nationally with collectorates as nodal agencies aiding government surveys.         
	Bengal, under this project, will depend on panchayats to supply the village-specific data on schools, the number of enrolled children and on the status of infrastructure to be built, Sen said.         
	The state government has asked the National Informatics Centre  Indias official information networker  to assist it in setting up the online map-based facility, the school education secretary said.

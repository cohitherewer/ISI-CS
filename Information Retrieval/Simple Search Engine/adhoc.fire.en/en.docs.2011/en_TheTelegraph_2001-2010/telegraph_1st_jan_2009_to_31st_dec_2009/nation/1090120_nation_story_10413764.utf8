The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Top on anti-terror agency list: an office
                                                                                                               Top on anti-terror agency list: an office
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 19: The head of Indias FBI-like agency took charge today  without an office to call his own.        
	Radha Vinod Raju began his stint as the chief of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) even as the home ministry remained undecided on an office.         
	Home minister P. Chidambaram had said last week that Raju, who had probed Rajiv Gandhis assassination and the Kandahar hijack, would initially function from the headquarters of the CBI, where he was once deputy director.        
	Till this evening, however, it seemed the 1975 batch IPS officer of the Jammu and Kashmir cadre would have to work from the CBI office longer than expected: there was little sign of any office being vacated for him.         
	Home ministry officials said no decision on the office had been taken but, added cryptically, that the location could be part of a plan to keep it under secrecy.        
	The UPA governments failure to provide the NIA an office is not in sync with its attempts to project the agency as an example of its seriousness to fight terror in the wake of the November 26 Mumbai attacks.        
	Nor does it help the image of Chidambaram, otherwise known to be meticulous and prompt.        
	Raju said after taking charge that he would immediately get down to the task of forming a core team.

										      SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                        
	New Delhi, March 17: The kindest verdict on the UPA governments voyages into the choppy waters of legislation would be that these have often been marked by muddled navigation and journeys round in circles.        
	If the law against domestic violence tried to bring succour to millions of battered wives, a criminal law amendment threatens to reduce the gain by sparing some of the accused from arrest.        
	Scrapping anti-terror law Pota may have upheld the citizens freedoms and allayed minority fears, but a new law landed a counter-punch by shoving the burden of proof on terror accused.        
	Compounding the confusion, there has been a lot of foot-dragging on promised legislation.        
	A comprehensive law to deal with communal violence was Promise No. 6 in the UPAs Common Minimum Programme (CMP). It was guaranteed personally by Sonia Gandhi at the Congress parliamentary party meeting of December 7, 2004.        
	The Communal Violence (Suppression) Bill, 2005, was introduced a year later, on December 5, 2005, in the Rajya Sabha, but has been pending ever since with the standing committee.        
	Aimed to prevent a repeat of Gujarat 2002, the bill lay entangled in the debate over the extraordinary powers it would give the Centre to interfere in the states domain of law and order.        
	Opposition-ruled states were reluctant to back it and the government fought shy of working pro-actively towards a consensus. Meanwhile, Christians came under attack in Orissa last year.        
	According to security expert K.S. Subramanian, this has been the UPA governments biggest single failure and mirrors its confusion over priorities.        
	Communal violence poses a much greater threat to national security than Naxalite violence, which the present government, as advised by the national security adviser, prioritises, he wrote in an article recently.        
	The Congress, like its predecessor (the) BJP, has remained silent on communal violence but waxed eloquent on Naxalite violence as a security threat, although the latter is basically symbolic of a development crisis, not one that challenges national security.        
	The government  or at least a section of it  tried its best on the contentious womens reservation bill, which sets aside a third of national and state legislature seats for women. But divisions within the UPA have ensured that it still hangs fire despite repeated promises, serial all-party huddles and recurrent reformulations.        
	The bills die-hard proponents such as Renuka Chowdhury have moved on to lesser battles elsewhere  like the fight against the moral police of Mangalore.        
	Some promised laws, like job reservations in the private sector, appear to have been given a quiet burial.        
	The case of the CMPs Promise No. 4, the repeal of NDA brainchild Pota, has been more curious. In one of its first policy decisions, the government abolished the law, claiming that the existing laws were sufficient to check terrorism.        
	However, when a backlash loomed and passions erupted after last Novembers Mumbai attack, the government rushed through a new terror law that overturns the traditional principle that an accused is innocent till proved guilty.         
	The only face-saver: confessions to the police are still inadmissible under the amended Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, unlike under Pota.        
	Yet some pieces of legislation shine on the UPA governments report card. One is the Right to Information Act, which opens up public access to information normally hidden deep inside dusty government files. Another is making the laws gender-neutral in matters of inheritance.        
	A huge step on the gender front was the domestic violence law, passed in 2005. A UN study had revealed the same year how two-thirds of married women in India suffered violence at home, and how every such incident translated into a woman losing seven working days.        
	Yet much of the gains risk being negated if the proposed amendment to the Criminal Procedure Code, tabled in end-2008, is passed. The bill gives police the option of not arresting anyone charged with an offence that entails less than seven years in jail  as charges of less serious violence would.        
	This also undermines Section 498A of the penal code, which mandates the police to arrest husbands and in-laws merely on a married womans complaint. The law has been credited with bringing down dowry-related deaths like no other law before, but must give way to the changed CrPC if the amendment act is passed.        
	The governments defence of the amendment is that tens of thousands of accused now languish in jail for years without trial because of the backlog of cases. So, cutting down on arrests and handing the accused a police notice is a smart idea.         
	Yet the government  law minister H.R. Bharadwaj in particular  has done little to help reduce the backlog, which is a curse on the common man seeking justice, either by setting up more courts or by fast-tracking judges appointments.        
	But when it came to protecting politicians turf against judicial activism, Bharadwaj has jumped to lead the charge by his peers, often dispensing with civility as he attacked judges in public.        
	His ministry also goofed up on Ottavio Quattrocchi, allowing the Bofors accused to withdraw money parked in a London bank.

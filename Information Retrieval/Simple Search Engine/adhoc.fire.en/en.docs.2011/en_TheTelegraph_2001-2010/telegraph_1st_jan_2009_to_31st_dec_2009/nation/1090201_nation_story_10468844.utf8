The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cop summons for cricket czar 
                                                                                                               Cop summons for cricket czar 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Modi: Statement date                                   
	Jaipur, Jan. 31: Rajasthan cricket board chief Lalit Modi was today summoned by police for recording his statement on a complaint that he misused funds that should have been deposited in the associations account.        
	The Indian Premier League boss initially refused to go to the designated Jyoti Nagar police station but later recorded his statement at SP (south) C.B. Sharmas office.        
	The summons came days after a forgery case was filed against the cricket czar, accusing him of buying land with the help of forged signatures in order to become president of the Rajasthan Cricket Association.        
	Under RCA rules, a person must be a native of Rajasthan or be a state employee or have permanent property in his or her district to head the association.        
	Modi was served the summons in his office at the Sawai Man Singh stadium here today. The case, filed on January 20 by Anil Shekhawat, a Samajwadi Party leader and general secretary of the Jaipur District Cricket Association, alleged that Modi had misused funds worth Rs 22.80 lakh.        
	He said the money  given by the Indian cricket board BCCI to the RCA under TV Rights subsidy during a match in World Cup 2007  was not deposited in the associations account.        
	The BCCI, which disburses funds to all state cricket associations, had deducted Rs 22.8 lakh from the amount for the year 2007-08. Shekhawat had pointed to the anomaly.        
	At the SPs office, Modi and his counsel Mehmood Abadi are said to have presented a BCCI letter dated January 27, 2009, saying the RCA would credit Rs 22.8 lakh into its account, compensating the amount allegedly misused.        
	It is like a thief stealing money, admitting it and later saying I will give it back or compensate it. But stealing in the first place still remains stealing, Shekhawat told The Telegraph.        
	Shekhawat also recorded his statement today with the police.        
	Police officer Sharma refused to divulge any information regarding Modis statement. The recording of the statement was still on at the time of writing the report.        
	Modi could not be reached for comment despite several attempts.        
	Allegations of financial impropriety and improper land deals are not the only worries for the cricket boss. A virtual war is on between Modi and RCA secretary Subhash Joshi.        
	While Modi has sought the apex courts directives on RCA elections and divested Joshi of all powers citing a clause in the associations constitution, Joshi has declared that elections would be held on the scheduled date, February 22.

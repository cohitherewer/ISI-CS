The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | J amp;K troops gesture before talks
                                                                                                               J amp;K troops gesture before talks
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                                             
	Srinagar, Oct. 19: The army has withdrawn two battalions, or 2,000 men, of the Rashtriya Rifles from counter-insurgency operations in Kashmir ahead of the proposed resumption of talks between separatists and the Centre.         
	Troops withdrawal has been one of the main demands of the separatists and mainstream political parties in Kashmir, and the latest move is being seen as a step to prepare the ground for the talks.        
	Army sources said a battalion of 33 Rashtriya Rifles (RR) has been pulled out of Handwaras Vilgam area in the border district of Kupwara. Another 1,000 men, of the 49 RR, have been taken out of the Qazigund area in south Kashmir.         
	They have been relocated to some other place in the state and it (withdrawal) is part of the assessment of their requirement in places where they are not needed and (we are) deploying them in places where they are needed, said Lieutenant Colonel J.S. Brar, the defence spokesperson in Srinagar.        
	Sources said the pullout of the two battalions, which have now been shifted to Jammu, has a symbolic value. It is to send the message that troops are being withdrawn from the Valley, an officer said.        
	Besides, there is an increased threat perception of militancy in Jammu because of infiltration. In the Valley, the infiltration routes remain closed in winter because of heavy snowfall and the troops requirement comes down, he added.        
	Rashtriya Rifles was created as a counter-insurgency force in the early 1990s, around the time militancy began, and its present strength is 66 battalions (66,000 men).         
	A source said five companies of the CRPF had also been moved out of the Valley. This follows the pullout of 25 companies of the paramilitary force a few months back.         
	The fresh cut in the forces came on a day separatist leader Syed Ali Geelani announced an agitation programme against the occupation of land by security forces.         
	We want complete demilitarisation of security forces who have occupied 27 lakh kanals (1,700sqkm) of land. The troops are not only a problem for our people but our ecology has also suffered. Their presence has caused devastation to our forests, water bodies and glaciers, Geelani said.        
	He said the agitation would start on October 23, with a strike in Shopian district. Strikes in other districts will follow. Soon after he announced the plan at a news conference, seven of his associates were arrested.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tribal player rues lack of unity
                                                                                                               Tribal player rues lack of unity
          JAYANTH JACOB IN BETUL (MP)                              
	Day labourer and tribal activist Mangal Singh, 50, knows he is likely to lose his deposit in the Betul Lok Sabha seat in southern Madhya Pradesh which voted on April 23.        
	But the candidate of the Samajwadi Jan Parishad (SJP), a conglomerate of peoples movements of farmers and tribals, cant help wondering what might have been. Only if all the NGOs leading the various peoples movements in the state would pitch in together!        
	Mangal may have a point. Madhya Pradesh has two huge sections of the downtrodden  the victims of the 1984 Bhopal gas leak and the 1.7 lakh families displaced by the various dams on the Narmada.        
	Officially, 5.34 lakh gas victims received compensation. Living in 36 of the Bhopal Municipal Corporations 56 wards, they are a sizeable presence in all seven Assembly constituencies of the Bhopal Lok Sabha seat and are definitely the majority in Bhopal North.        
	The dam oustees are spread across tribal areas like Jhabua, Dhar, Khandwa, Betul and Khargon, where the Narmada Bachao Andolan (NBA) wields considerable influence.        
	Mangal and his colleagues in the SJP believe the big NGOs, like the NBA and the Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Udyog Sangathan, should get together with them and put up common candidates.        
	There does exist a political space for us. And all the peoples movements also understand that to influence policies, we need to win elections, said Anurag Modi of the Shramik Adivasi Sangathan, a constituent of the SJP along with the Shramik Mazdoor Sangathan.        
	We are trying to build such a platform where everyone will work together, but we have a long way to go, added Modi, a civil engineer who works among tribals in Harda.        
	His wife Shamim had fought last years Assembly polls from Harda and, in the absence of backing from the bigger NGOs, won only 3,000 votes.         
	Mangal had been travelling village to village riding pillion on the motorbike of Bhagram, who too had contested the last Assembly elections. Bhagram, a member of the Kisan Adivasi Sangthan, won just 9,000 votes from Itarsi.         
	They are not the only peoples movement activists who believe in fighting elections. The Adivasi Ekta Sangathan and Adivasi Mukthi Sangathan have come together for the first time to field Lok Sabha candidates. Gajanan is in the fray from Khargon and Nahar Singh from Khandwa.         
	However, activists of the NBA and gas victims bodies are determined to remain staunchly apolitical though they accuse both the BJP and the Congress of not doing enough for the deprived people they represent. They believe that once they enter politics, they would be seen as just another political party and their criticism of governments would be tagged political.        
	Aloke Agarwal, a senior NBA activist, said: We should remain only a peoples movement and exert pressure on the establishment through mass mobilisation and other campaigns.         
	Abdul Jabbar, who runs the Bhopal Gas Peedit Mahila Udyog Sangthan, shares this view.         
	 Betul voted on April 23; Khargon and Khandwa vote on April 30

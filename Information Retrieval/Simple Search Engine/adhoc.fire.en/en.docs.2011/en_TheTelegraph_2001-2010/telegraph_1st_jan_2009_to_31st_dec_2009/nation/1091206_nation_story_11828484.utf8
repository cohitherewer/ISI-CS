          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec.5: Union home minister P. Chidambaram today condemned the attack on Hurriyat leader Fazal Haq Qureshi, apparently throwing the Centres weight behind the moderates in Kashmir.         
	The attack on Shri Qureshi was a cowardly attempt by those who do not wish that the problems of Jammu and Kashmir should be resolved through talks and in a peaceful manner. These are the elements which, in the past, have pushed Jammu and Kashmir to the brink of a crisis. It is also clear that these elements act at the behest of forces that are inimical to India, Chidambaram said in a written statement, obliquely hinting at a Pakistani hand behind the attack.         
	Chidambaram said the Centre would not be cowed down by such violent acts that sought to interrupt the process of quiet talks and quiet diplomacy. I am happy to read the statements of the Mirwaiz and others who have vowed to continue their efforts to find a peaceful resolution through talks with the Government of India, Chidambaram said.         
	Amitabh Mattoo, a professor of international studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University and Kashmir affairs expert, lauded the home ministers efforts at reaching out to the separatists in Kashmir.        
	He has perhaps done it to see that the government of India is reaching out to the people of Kashmir. If he did not say it he may be seen as insensitive and if he does then he leaves the moderates vulnerable. But he has thought of being sensitive, Mattoo said.         
	The Centre has in the recent past stepped up efforts for a peaceful solution to the Kashmir issue. On our part, I assure the people of Jammu and Kashmir that we remain committed to finding a solution through quiet talks with every shade of political opinion in Jammu and Kashmir, Chidambaram said .

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Allies battle for poll seats
                                                                                                               Allies battle for poll seats
                            
	Patna, March 8 (PTI): With the pressure to outsmart each other and gain as many seats as possible in the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls from Bihar, the coalition partners of the NDA and the UPA are battling hard to work out a seat-sharing accord.        
	Several rounds of talks among the allies of the UPA and the NDA for an amicable seat-sharing on the total 40 Lok Sabha seats have failed so far. The logjam continues in JD(U)-BJP on the seat-sharing even after chief minister Nitish Kumar held parleys with JD(U) national president Sharad Yadav and BJPs campaign in-charge of Bihar Arun Jaitley in New Delhi yesterday. JD(U) has given BJP an offer to contest on nearly 14 seats, but the saffron party is not happy with this.        
	State JD(U) chief Rajiv Ranjan alias Lalan Singh went on record to say that if the BJP was not satisfied with the 14 seats under alliance it can go and contest all 40 seats.        
	Though the state BJP leaders may be demanding 15-16 seats compared to 19 on which the party fielded its nominees last time with an alliance with JD(U), but the partys central leaders firmly believe that they can achieve a respectable figure in the Lok Sabha polls only by riding piggy on the positive image of Nitish Kumar. The BJP is just not in a position to contest the elections on its own in Bihar and the JD(U) vote bank will come in useful in seeing the BJP through.         
	Political analysts believe that the BJP may, in all probabilities, agree to field its candidates on 14 out of 40 seats in alliance with JD(U) to disallow advantage to UPA.        
	A problem, akin to the NDA, has cropped up in UPA in Bihar over the vexed issue of seat-sharing among its allies. LJP president and Union steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan has threatened that his party would go it alone in all 40 seats if its claim on 16 seats is not entertained by the RJD. Though he has not budged from his stand, sources close to Paswan confide that the party would be content with nearly a dozen of seats, if Lalu Prasad spares them.        
	All eyes are now set on the RJD chiefs stand and it is believed that a last-ditch attempt by UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi on the vexed issue would ensure a respectable seat sharing among the UPA allies  RJD, LJP, Congress and NCP. In the 2004 elections, RJD contested 26 seats and gave eight to LJP, four to Congress and one each to the CPM and NCP. RJD won 22, LJP four and Congress three.

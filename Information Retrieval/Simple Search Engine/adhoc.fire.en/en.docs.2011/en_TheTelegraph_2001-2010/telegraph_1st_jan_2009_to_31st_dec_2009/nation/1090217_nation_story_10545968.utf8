	Patna, Feb. 16: At least four persons, including a 10-year-old girl, died when a portion of an under-construction railway bridge caved in at Amgola in Muzaffarpur here today.        
	A 18-metre-long and 2.5m-wide slab, weighing 47-tonnes, caved in from the bridge, crushing four and leaving five injured.         
	The deceased included a girl and her 41-year-old mother riding pillion of a scooter being driven by the womans husband. They were crossing the tracks beneath the overbridge at the north Bihar town, about 90km from here.        
	The man, though suffering from multiple injures, has survived and is undergoing treatment with four others in the Muzaffarpur Sadar hospital.         
	The overbridge is being constructed by Ircon and is almost complete sticking to its March deadline. Ircon officials and workers disappeared from the site as thousands of people gathered there blocking the tracks and roads.        
	Muzaffarpur district magistrate Bipin Kumar announced a compensation of Rs 1.5 lakh to the victims families and said that the government would bear the treatment cost of the injured.        
	Incidentally, the mishap provided chief minister Nitish Kumar an opportunity to train guns on railway minister Lalu Prasad. Nitish said: This is how the railway works in the country, he remarked.        
	Nitish, who embarked on the fourth round of his vikas yatra today, ordered an inquiry.

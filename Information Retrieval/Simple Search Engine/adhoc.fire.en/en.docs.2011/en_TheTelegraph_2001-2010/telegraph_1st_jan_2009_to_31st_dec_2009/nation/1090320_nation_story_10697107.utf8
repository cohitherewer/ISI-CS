The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Varun bail
                                                                                                               Varun bail
                            
	New Delhi, March 19: Three FIRs filed under the Election Commissions orders in as many days prompted a panicky Varun Gandhi to move Delhi High Court today for anticipatory bail.         
	The bail plea will be heard early tomorrow, his lawyer Sandeep Kapur said.        
	Varun has been accused of spreading hate through anti-Muslim speeches during his election campaign in Pilibhit, the Uttar Pradesh seat from where he is set to make his poll debut as a BJP candidate.        
	The 29-year-old moved quickly amid reports from Lucknow that state police were waiting for the forensic report on his hate speech CD and would seek a non-bailable arrest warrant soon.        
	In his bail appeal, Varun denied making inflammatory speeches.         
	He has been falsely implicated, his lawyer said. The FIR is an attempt to derail his campaign.        
	The first FIR, registered on March 17 at Barkheda police station, accused Varun of delivering an inciting speech on March 8 which caused insecurity in the minds of one particular community.         
	It said the meeting he addressed was held without permission and in violation of Section 144 imposed by the local administration.         
	Additional charges under Section 505(2) (statements creating public mischief) and Section 295 (offence relating to religion) of the IPC were later included in the FIR.         
	Two FIRs were registered last night at Laulikhera and Kotwali police stations.         
	The Pilibhit district authorities today also took note of complaints that Varun was distributing money among voters.

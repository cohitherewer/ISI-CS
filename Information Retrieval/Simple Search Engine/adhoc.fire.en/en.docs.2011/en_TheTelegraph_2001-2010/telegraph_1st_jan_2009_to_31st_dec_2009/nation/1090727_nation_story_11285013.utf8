The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hooded House visitor caught
                                                                                                               Hooded House visitor caught
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, July 26: The snake, suspected to be a cobra, which had crept into the Orissa Assembly on Thursday, was caught last evening.         
	However, the reptile turned out to be a non-venomous wolf snake.         
	The reptilian visitor was spotted on the floor of the House around 9.05pm last night shortly after it was adjourned at 8.55pm. When members rose from their chairs, the one-and-a-half feet reptile was spotted slithering towards the chair of the leader of the Opposition.         
	Most members had left the Assembly by then. Only about eight persons were present when the snake showed itself, said Subhendu Mallick, the chief of Snake Helpline that caught the reptile.        
	Like the first time, ward staff Bhimsen was the first to spot the snake.         
	Ever since the snake was spotted, a motley crew of snake charmers, sniffer dogs and wildlife experts could be seen keeping a strict vigil over the Assembly. All searches had failed till yesterday, when the visitor decided to show itself.         
	Bhimsen immediately raised an alarm summoning security officials who called the Snake Helpline activists present on the spot. The reptile was later put in a ventilated bottle for its safety.        
	Though the slippery intruder has been caught, the question of how it got to enter the House continues to haunt minds. And Bhimsen, too, has added to the panic by declaring that it is not the same snake.        
	Its not the snake I saw, Bhimsen said, sparking fear of the presence of more such reptiles in the House. Later he added: I dont know if this is the same snake, as the one I saw was a poisonous reptile.

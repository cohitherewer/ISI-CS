The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sushma buzz in BJP
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sushma buzz in BJP
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sushma Swaaraj                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 20: Sushma Swaraj is widely tipped to take over as the leader of the Opposition from L.K. Advani when he quits the post.         
	She has the full backing of the RSS and those in the BJP whose veto counts in critical decisions (Advani and party president Rajnath Singh), sources claimed.         
	It is learnt that Advani has told Sushma, his deputy in the Lok Sabha, she will succeed him and Arun Jaitley will continue as the leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha.         
	The arrangement is of a piece with an understanding reached between Advani and the RSS. While the Sangh was allowed to name its nominee as the BJP president, Advani would have the last say on putting the leaders in place in Parliament. Both Sushma and Jaitley are his proteges.         
	Sources close to Sushma said she had been offered the BJP presidents post but she had turned it down because she preferred doing parliamentary work.         
	Agencies quoted Sushma as telling reporters in Bhopal today: It is a painful thought to replace Advani while he is around. There is no proposal and I have not given consent to any such idea.        
	Asked about the offer, an RSS source said: She has done very well in Parliament and her oratorical skills are well known.         
	Sangh sources said they had seriously considered the names of Jaitley and Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi before zeroing in on Nitin Gadkari for the post of BJP president. But Modi refused to leave Gujarat while there was no credible explanation for Jaitley not making the cut.         
	The BJP has set a precedent under which the Opposition leader in the Lok Sabha leads the party in a general election and logically qualifies as its prime ministerial candidate.         
	Even Sushmas detractors in the party acknowledge she is their most charismatic face and has a captive constituency of her own.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 25: The Orissa government will submit a memorandum to the 13th Finance Commission, seeking grant worth Rs 1,32,141 crore to make up for the projected revenue deficit for 2010-15.         
	The memorandum will be presented to the commissions visiting team tomorrow. Commission chairman Vijay R. Kelkar would head the team, said finance minister Prafulla Chandra Ghadei.        
	Kelkar arrived in Bhubaneswar on Tuesday on a five-day visit, while other members reached here this afternoon. The team is scheduled to meet chief minister Naveen Patnaik, finance minister Ghadei and government staff at a meeting tomorrow. The team will also meet representatives of trade bodies and economists.        
	A senior official of the finance department said the detailed memorandum would be presented tomorrow.         
	It is estimated that Rs 1,98,322 crore would be required for payment of salary, pension and to repay loans, interest and non-loan dues during the above period. However, the exchequer is expected to generate a revenue income of Rs 66,180 crore, thus creating a deficit of Rs 1,32,141 crore.        
	The government will also demand a hike in central tax share from 30.5 per cent to 50 per cent and downward revision of interest on ongoing external-aided projects from 9 per cent to 7.5 per cent.         
	A proposal will also be submitted to enhance the corpus of Calamity Relief Fund for 2010-15 from Rs 1,599 crore to Rs 4,000 crore. Besides, a revision in the ratio of central-state share in the Calamity Relief Fund would be requested from the present ratio of 75:25 to 90:10. The state will seek a Rs 16,387-crore package to development various sectors.

          G.C. SHEKHAR                              
	Chennai, Dec. 24: Two policemen who delayed an accident victims post-mortem, preventing his eyes from being donated, will have to cough up Rs 40,000 in compensation for human rights violation.        
	The Tamil Nadu Human Rights Commission passed the ruling on December 21 after the victims brother-in-law charged the police with failing to give the requisition letter for post-mortem in time, making his eyes unfit for donation.        
	P. Gnanasundaram, 60, a farmer from Pollachi, 450km from here, was injured in a road accident on June 4, 2007. He was being shifted from the local government hospital to GH Hospital in Coimbatore, 40km away, when he died on the way.        
	The Pollachi police were immediately informed and the body brought back to the Pollachi hospital. The victims relatives rushed to the police seeking the requisition letter for the post-mortem so Gnanasundarams eyes could be donated thereafter, in keeping with a pledge he had made.        
	But the police took their own time with an inspector making the family run from one desk to another.        
	On our request, a team of doctors at the Pollachi government hospital was waiting to conduct the post-mortem and another team to simultaneously remove the eyes. But the six-hour time limit for extracting the eyes expired and the corneas became useless because of the polices mindless delay, Gnanasundarams brother-in-law, K. Mahalingam, said.        
	The post-mortem was done the following day and the victim was cremated without his eyes being donated.        
	Even though we had clearly informed the police about the urgency in view of Gnanasundarams desire to donate his eyes, the police were very casual in their approach. This caused even more grief to the victims family members and amounted to violation of their human rights for which the policemen concerned should be penalised, Mahalingam, a bus operator, said in his petition to the state rights commission.        
	He argued the case himself. The two policemen he had cited for negligence claimed they had merely followed procedure.        
	The commission held that inspector Mani and sub-inspector Saravanan were guilty of dereliction of duty, which led to a situation that prevented not only the execution of the victims altruistic wish but also the restoration of eyesight to two visually challenged persons.        
	We hold this to be a violation of the human rights of Gnanasundarams family. The commission directs that a compensation of Rs 40,000 be paid to the family with Rs 30,000 being collected from the inspector and Rs 10,000 from the sub-inspector, the commission ruled.        
	We hope the commissions rap makes the policemen realise their folly and makes them more sensitive to the feelings of people like us, Mahalingam said.        
	He said the family would donate the compensation amount towards improving the condition of the mortuary at the Pollachi government hospital.

          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN      
	New Delhi, Aug. 30: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat has indicated the BJP neednt confine the hunt for a new party chief to Delhis GeNext and the quartet of Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley, M. Venkaiah Naidu and Ananth Kumar.        
	Arun Shourie also ran through a list of the partys state leaders in a recent TV interview and picked Narendra Modi and Manohar Parrikar for praise. While Modi is almost ruled out for the top post because he is perceived more as a liability now than an asset, Parrikar is seen differently.        
	Parrikar, the former Goa chief minister who Shourie claimed was still remembered for his administration, has been short-listed as a state leader who could be considered Rajnath Singhs successor when his term ends in December.         
	Sources said unlike the BJP, still trying to douse the post-poll bush fires, the RSS was inclined to take a long-term view. Prominent on its radar is the likely emergence of Rahul Gandhi as the Congresss main leader in the next general elections. The RSS has factored in the possibility that the persons who replace Rajnath and L.K. Advani (as leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha) might be prospective prime ministerial candidates. Hence, the stress on a generational change, a source said.        
	At 54, Parrikar is among the BJPs third-ranking leaders, after Jaitley and the others. A product of IIT Bombay, he is said to be tech-savvy and a Hindu nationalist. The BJP hopes he can appeal to upwardly mobile urban India and, at the same time, pander to the beliefs of those still wedded to the RSSs core thinking.         
	The RSS, said sources, is deeply concerned with the flight of urban votes to the Congress after the party successfully projected Manmohan Singh and the nuclear deal as harbingers of the next phase of reforms, not just in economics but also in foreign policy.        
	Some of these voters include our core constituents whose worldview usually began and ended with the BJP, a general secretary said.        
	But what eventually appears to be favouring Parrikar over his peers is that he is not aligned with any known BJP faction and can, therefore, be trusted to run the party organisation without fear, favour and malice, the source said.         
	If the plusses stack up into a pretty wholesome pile, Parrikars negatives are that he comes from a tiny western state, known more for its sun and sand than its politics.        
	Also, he is unknown in Delhi and north India and needs to be insured against political vagaries with a huge premium. (This is) something fraught with risks which we cannot afford now, the source said. Nobody can say if Parrikar is comfortable speaking Hindi and what social signal he will beam across the country.         
	Therefore, a proposal being thought of is to induct Parrikar as a general secretary in the BJP when a new president takes over so he is blooded into the system sufficiently before the next election.        
	Parrikars contemporaries enlarge the BJP talent pool. They include Shivraj Singh Chauhan, Raman Singh, Sushil Modi and Nitin Gadkari. While Chauhan and Singh have done stints in Delhi in the government and the party, Modi and Gadkari have been confined to Bihar and Maharashtra.        
	Sources said as chief ministers of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, Chauhan and Singh cannot be replaced easily as the move might trigger another succession battle. As Bihar deputy chief minister, Modi enjoys a perfect rapport with his boss and Janata Dal (United) heavyweight Nitish Kumar. Take him away and there will be chaos for us, the source said.        
	Chauhan and Singh could be made members of the parliamentary board, the top policy-making body, to give them a foothold in Delhi.

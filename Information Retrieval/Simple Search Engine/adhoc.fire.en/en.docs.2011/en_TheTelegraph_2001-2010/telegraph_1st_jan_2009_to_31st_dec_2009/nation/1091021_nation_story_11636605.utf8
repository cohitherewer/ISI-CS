          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, Oct. 20: Approximately 27 children have died due to encephalitis-meningitis at Gayas Anugrah Narain Magadh Medical College Hospital this year.         
	In 2008, 40 children died of encephalitis in the same hospital, and in 2007, the epidemic took a heavier toll. Almost all victims belonged to the deprived sections living closely to animals, including pigs. A sizeable number were Mushars, a member of the Mahadalit community.         
	Recurrence of the epidemic for the third year has put a question mark on the effectiveness of the health system and absence of preventive measures including use of disinfectants, medicated mosquito nets and mosquito eradication measures.         
	Grappling with the epidemic, hospital superintendent Shiv Kumari Paswan has sent an SOS to the health officials demanding doctors and trained nurses, as treatment has taken a hit with a scarcity of doctors and nurses. The superintendent said that at least four trained nurses were immediately required to take care of the 16 patients still battling with the disease.         
	As against the requirement of 12 doctors (one professor, one associate professor, two assistant professors, two senior residents and six junior residents), the paediatrics department is run by three doctors.         
	Altogether 85 patients were admitted to the paediatric ward of which 27 died, while 16 are still being treated. Forty-two were discharged after treatment. Sources put the number of encephalitis deaths higher than the official figure of 27, as a number of patients die while being treated by quacks, faith healers or from no treatment at all.         
	When contacted, Gaya magistrate Sanjay Kumar admitted that there was an out-break and said testing kits were being sent off to the districts hit and added that a review of the situation would be done and action would be taken against non-performing officials.

  - Former US President asks about womens reservation bill, recalls nuclear deal run-up         RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Bush and Singh at a meeting in Hyderabad in 2006. (File picture)                                        
	New Delhi, Oct. 30: If the people of India love George W. Bush deeply, as Manmohan Singh averred last year, the former US President too loves Indias women.        
	He loved them enough this afternoon, at least, to find himself asking fellow guests at the Prime Ministers residence about the womens reservation bill.        
	Bush was flanked by Meira Kumar and Sonia Gandhi at the luncheon table, where the conversation veered from legislative practices in the US Congress to those in Indias Parliament.        
	When the Lok Sabha Speaker flagged off the subject of womens reservation, Bush became inquisitive.        
	In the genteel ambience of 7 Race Course Road, nobody spoke of the bills dim chances. Not even the ladies, who included I amp;B minister Ambika Soni, Rajya Sabha MP and Hindustan Times editorial director Shobhana Bhartia, and TV news anchor Sagarika Ghose.        
	Bush asked if the proposed 33 per cent quota would work: would it be left to the parties to implement it (as bill opponents like Mulayam Singh Yadav have been insisting) or would it be passed into law? Would constituencies then be reserved for women?        
	No one told him it was a known unknown, to borrow a phrase from Bushs former colleague Donald Rumsfeld.        
	But by then, the guests had discovered that Bush could no longer be misunderestimated  he wasnt all about cowboy machismo and bubble-gum humour.        
	The former President said he read a lot these days  I know nobody would believe me when I say this, a guest quoted him. Although Bush didnt say what he was reading, he revealed he was setting up a library at the Southern Methodist University near his home in Dallas.        
	He also wants to travel. His planned visit to Agra tomorrow to see the Taj Mahal  an unfulfilled wish from his last trip to India  is a good start, Bush said. Sonia urged him to come again and see more of the country.        
	That was her only intervention. Apart from Bush and Singh, few others spoke. Both recalled the run-up to the nuclear deal, with the Prime Minister telling Bush how the people of India would for ever be grateful to him for facilitating the treaty.        
	The American praised Singh for his leadership and grit at a critical moment.        
	They also remembered their common friends Vladimir Putin and Tony Blair, among others  and where they last met them. Expectedly, they were silent on the present administration in the US.        
	The guest list had only one leader from the Opposition: L.K. Advani. He was uncharacteristically quiet and Bush, a guest said, tried to draw him out before and after the lunch. Good to see you again, he told the BJP leader.        
	It couldnt be known if he regaled fellow guests with a Bushism or two.        
	The other guests included Rahul Gandhi, foreign minister S.M. Krishna, Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia, foreign secretary Nirupama Rao, her predecessors Shyam Saran and Shiv Shankar Menon, minister of state in the PMO Prithviraj Chavan, and the PMs former media adviser Sanjaya Baru.        
	Bush is in Delhi as a private citizen to address a media summit tomorrow.

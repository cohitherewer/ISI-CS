The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | HC lifts Jaswant book ban
                                                                                                               HC lifts Jaswant book ban
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Jaswant: Relief                                  
	Ahmedabad, Sept. 4: Gujarat High Court today set aside the Narendra Modi governments ban on Jaswant Singhs book on Mohammad Ali Jinnah, saying the notification did not explain how the books contents were misleading and against the public tranquillity.        
	The state government spokesperson, Jaynarayan Vyas, indicated the administration might issue a fresh ban notification  which the court said it was free to do.         
	The Gujarat government had on August 19 issued a notification banning the book Jinnah: India-Partition, Independence because the contents were highly objectionable and against the national interest.         
	A three-member bench headed by Chief Justice K.S. Radhakrishnan came down on the government for issuing a notification that showed lack of thinking, caution and prudence, which were required in this case as it pertains to the fundamental rights of citizens.         
	The court observed the notification said that contents of the book are highly objectionable and against the national interest, but did not substantiate the claim.         
	It is silent as to how the contents of the book would affect and disturb public tranquillity. No opinion has been expressed by the state, which indicates lack of thinking, which means lack of understanding, the court said.         
	However, it said there was no restriction on the state government if it wanted to issue a fresh notification.        
	The government claimed that the court had set the ban aside on technicalities.         
	Asked whether the government would issue a fresh notification, home secretary T.S. Bist said: We are yet to take a decision.         
	Vyas, the government spokesperson, however, said: At the moment, we are studying the judgment and examining our options. Our notification has been set side only on technical grounds. We had not cited objectionable contents in the book as we thought it would defeat the very purpose of the ban. But we will be extensively quoting the objectionable material in the book.         
	The petitioners counsel, Anand Yagnik, argued that the government had not expressed any opinion on the books contents, nor had it explained how the contents were against the public tranquillity.         
	The court upheld the argument, saying the notification indicated that the government had not read the book before banning it.         
	Sources said minutes after the high court lifted the ban, a Gujarat-based publisher said that a Gujarati translation of the book would be made available soon. The book is already available in Hindi and Urdu.

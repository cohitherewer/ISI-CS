          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 26: A day after buses were burnt by students, the Utkal University campus continued to remain tense even as NSUI members today met Governor Murlidhar Chandrakant Bhandare to end the stalemate.        
	The students have urged the governor  also the university chancellor  to intervene into the matter and find how and why the police entered the campus to arrest students. Accusing the police of working in a partisan manner, NSUI state president Chinmay Sahu criticised the way in which the BJD allegedly used the police to suppress them.        
	The memorandum also urged the governor to lift the indefinite closure of the university since Saturday.         
	The closure has taken its toll on the education system, said Sahu, who was released from jail yesterday.                                
	The agitation today gained momentum with students of many colleges joining the protest. Most colleges in the city remained closed for the second consecutive day today in the wake of the unrest.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | ID head Nilekani takes Caesars wife pledge
                                                                                                               ID head Nilekani takes Caesars wife pledge
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, June 25: Nandan Nilekani, who will take charge of the worlds largest biometric ID card project, today said he would ensure there would be no conflict of interest should Infosys bid for some of the contracts for the scheme.         
	Caesars wife should be above blame, Nilekani, who will step down as Infosys co-chairman, told a television interviewer. He added that Infosys had become a byword for corporate ethics.        
	There is not going to be any conflict of interest because I have not taken up this job to create conflict of interest. I will make sure that we have the highest standards of integrity, openness, transparency and process in all procurement. A slightest issue (and) I will recuse myself from the decision, Nilekani said.        
	Analysts said the identity card project could cost anywhere between $2 billion (Rs 9,722 crore) and $10 billion (Rs 48, 610 crore).        
	Companies like Mahindra Satyam and National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) are likely to bid for the project. NSDL has already tied up with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) to work on issuing PAN cards and create a centralised pension records system.        
	Infosys hasnt ruled out the prospect of bidding for some sections of the project. If it makes sense for us to bid, we will, an official said.        
	I cant think of anyone better than Nandan to head the project, said Montek Singh Ahluwalia, deputy chairman of the Planning Commission which has been spearheading the project.        
	Software, hardware and IT-enabled service companies will all benefit from this project, said Som Mittal, the president of Nasscom, the apex forum for software companies.        
	He reckoned that the project could cost close to $2 billion. More important, it paves the way for spending the other $8-10 billion which is the total outlay for all e-governance projects, Mittal added.        
	The first batch of cards is likely to be issued in the second half of next year. In the 12-18 months from now, the first set of people should be having the card under this model, Nilekani said.        
	The government is hoping to try out the system and issue the first series of the cards by the middle of next year. The government should be in a position to start testing out the system and issuing cards to at least some people within a year, Ahluwalia said.        
	Some countries, like Singapore, have biometric ID cards. But there is no other country in the world that has issued cards on such a scale.        
	Planning Commission officials said that once the unique ID card system was in place, it would be easy to ferret out illegal migrants or terrorists from neighbouring countries who had been able to live here for long periods of time.

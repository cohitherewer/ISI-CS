The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ambani staff questioned
                                                                                                               Ambani staff questioned
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, April 30: A former director-general of police now working with the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group as security officer and two colleagues were today questioned over the death of Bharat Borge, the aviation technician who had found pebbles and gravel in Anil Ambanis helicopter.        
	Prakash Sawant, the assistant commissioner of Government Railway Police who is investigating the death, said: We had called three ADAG officials to record their statements. Statements of K.K. Kashyap, Shailesh Kale and Capt. Chawla were recorded.         
	Borge, 47, was found dead on rail tracks on Tuesday morning, days after reporting that Ambanis helicopter had been tampered with. He worked with Airworks Engineering, a chopper maintenance company.         
	Sawant said Kashyap, the former director-general, and two colleagues at ADAG visited the Airworks hangar on Monday evening to discuss the maintenance of Ambanis Bell 412, and met Borge briefly.        
	They said they did not come to meet Borge specifically. They had visited the hangar pertaining to the ADAG aircraft under maintenance where a technician introduced them to Borge, Sawant said.         
	Kashyap denied he had taken Borges phone number.         
	A letter written in Marathi found in the dead technicians pocket said some Reliance officials had come to meet Borge and had taken his telephone number. The letter was addressed to inspector S. Bhole of the crime branch, which is probing the chopper sabotage.         
	The letter also said Borge suspected the officials were trying to use him and expressed the fear that he would be implicated in the sabotage.         
	ADAG has said in a letter to the chief minister that the tampering was an attempt to murder Ambani and that business rivals could be behind it.         
	The police yesterday recorded the statements of witnesses, including gateman Gopinath Pawar who was manning the railway crossing where Borge was run over, and the trains motorman P.K.S. Pillai.         
	Pawar told the police he saw the technician stop on railway track no 4. He shouted to Borge to warn him about the oncoming train, but the technician stayed put and was hit by the train, which dragged his body nearly 50 metres.         
	Pillai said he honked several times after spotting Borge about 100 feet away on the track, but he did not move.         
	GRP Commissioner Ashok Sharma said: Our investigations and witness statements are so far indicating that Borges death was a suicide. But investigations are on.        
	Borges family had yesterday demanded a CBI probe.         
	The crime branch is probing if a labour dispute at Airworks might have led to disgruntled staff inserting pebbles in Ambanis helicopter.         
	Ravi Menon, director and works head of Airworks, said: The labour dispute is sub judice and I cant comment on it. After pebbles were found, we had asked 52 of our employees not to report for work assuring them their salaries would be protected. The police have been recording statements of Airworks engineers, and investigations are on. It would be premature to say anything.

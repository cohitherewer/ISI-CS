The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sugar mill in Sonia seat shut
                                                                                                               Sugar mill in Sonia seat shut

	Lucknow, June 29: The Mayavati government today shut down a sugar mill in Rae Bareli set up by Indira Gandhi saying it was financially unviable, prompting the Congress to term the move a political vendetta against Sonia Gandhi who now represents the constituency.        
	Dariyapur Sugar Mill, named after the place it is located in, 7km from Rae Bareli, is the only sugar mill in the district and was set up in 1975 by the late Prime Minister.        
	The closure has further soured the already deteriorating relationship between the Congress and the Bahujan Samaj Party chief.         
	The Uttar Pradesh Sugar Corporation Ltd, a government agency which ran the Dariyapur mill, said inadequate sugarcane supply and other logistical reasons prompted the decision to temporarily stop production at the mill.         
	Corporation officials said the mills losses had accumulated over the past 10 years and touched around Rs 220 crore. In 2005, the mill had been referred to the Bureau of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction.         
	The word temporarily in the stop production order does not mean it would be revived in the near future, said R.K. Mathur, the mills administrative officer.        
	The mill has about 700 employees, of whom 185 are regular staff. But it was a bread-earner for around 5 lakh families, including 20,000 cane growers, transporters and contractors, said Vijayshankar Agnihotri, president of the employees union.        
	The state government has 28 mills, all of which have been making losses. But the government chose to close down the Rae Bareli factory to settle a political score with the UPA president, Agnihotri added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Three kids die of brain disease
                                                                                                               Three kids die of brain disease
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, Oct. 27: Gayas encephalitis toll rose to 30 today with three more deaths reported in the last week.        
	The deaths occurred at the paediatric ward of Anugrah Narain Magadh Medical College Hospital where 17 patients are still battling for their lives. Condition of three is stated to be critical.        
	Confirming the deaths, hospital superintendent Shiv Kumari Paswan said that altogether 109 patients were admitted in the pre-winter season this year. Thirty lives were lost to the disease, 62 were discharged and 17 are still being treated.         
	This is the third year when encephalitis has taken an epidemic form in the state. Most patients belong to disadvantaged groups, mostly Musahars, a Mahadalit community forced to live in close proximity to farm animals such as pigs and chickens.        
	A week ago, the hospital superintendent sent an SOS to senior officials requisitioning services of at least four trained nurses and deputation of more specialists to handle the situation. The superintendent said that nurses and doctors were yet to join. She hoped the personnel would join soon.         
	Gaya magistrate Sanjay Kumar said he had received several complaints of cases were patients were let off without a CT scan being conducted on the excuse that they were not carrying their mandatory BPL cards or money. Orders have been issued for free and mandatory CT scan for all patients. The scan bills will be footed by the Rogi Kalyan Samiti, said Kumar.         
	He added that 10kg of rice would be provided (daily) by Mahabodhi Temple to attendants during treatment.         
	Last year when a bout of encephalitis struck, members of the IMAs Gaya chapter volunteered to meet personnel shortage.                    
	Gaya IMA secretary D.K. Sahay said that in 2007, the then divisional commissioner K.P. Rammaiah and the medical college authorities had sought their co-operation. But, no such request was sought this time. But the IMA is more than willing to chip in their services if it was being sought.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | MG, not other Gs, for job scheme
                                                                                                               MG, not other Gs, for job scheme
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 2: The rural job scheme has been named after Gandhi, but not the Gandhi the Congress initially had in mind.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today announced that the scheme would now be known as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS).        
	The addition of the two alphabets  perhaps the most widely used prefix for roads in the country  means that the earlier options of RG (Rajiv Gandhi) and IG (Indira Gandhi) have been shelved.        
	State units of the Congress had been pitching for a Gandhi tag on the job scheme for a long time as local governments had tried to make it look like their project.        
	Fearing that the Congress will be denied credit for the popular scheme, the party wanted to stamp a national seal on the programme.        
	The Prime Minister renamed the scheme at a conference here on the occasion of the golden jubilee of the panchayati raj system.        
	Making the announcement, the Prime Minister said the dedication of the NREGS to Mahatma Gandhi was a fitting tribute.         
	Mahatma Gandhi gave more emphasis on Gram Swaraj. To name the NREGA after him is a humble tribute from us to the Father of the Nation, he said.        
	He said it was only through panchayati raj institutions that the governments programmes and schemes could be implemented in a transparent and effective manner.        
	The central government has to play a major role in the effective functioning of panchayati raj institutions. Implementation of the NREGA by the panchayati raj institutions is one such example, he said.        
	The Prime Minister said 2009-10 would be observed as the year of the Gram Sabha.         
	Congress president Sonia Gandhi said the NREGS needed to be made more effective in the coming years.        
	PTI quoted former minister Mani Shankar Aiyar as saying in Jaipur that the country had failed to successfully implement the panchayati raj system.

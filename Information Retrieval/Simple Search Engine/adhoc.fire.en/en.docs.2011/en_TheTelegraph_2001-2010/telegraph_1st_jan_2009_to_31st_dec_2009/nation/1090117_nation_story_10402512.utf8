	Patna/Bhagalpur, Jan. 16: Inspired by Bollywood flicks, at least three Maoists and five criminals were set free by their aides from a prison van this afternoon while they were returning from the Jamui district court.        
	Sources said that about 50 Maoists raided the prison van around 5.10pm and threw chilli powder at the policemen, blinding them for a while. They also began firing and hurled a few bombs on the security men, creating panic near the court premises.         
	The sources said that three Naxalite leaders Viveka Yadav, Sunil Baitha and Pouloush Hembrom, and criminals Gulabi Yadav, Munna Sha, Goralal Tanti were among the 11 undertrials who managed to escape.        
	Jamui superintendent of police Vinay Kumar said additional security forces had been deployed around the court and the prison, and a massive manhunt had been launched to arrest the undertrials who are believed to have sneaked into the nearby Laxmipur forests.         
	Vrigu Srinivasan, the deputy inspector-general of police (Munger range), said that two companies of CRPF had been sent to Jamui in addition to one battalion of STF to launch the combing operation.        
	The sources said 95 undertrial prisoners from the Jamui district jail had been produced at the court today in three phases.         
	Sources at the jail said that several Maoist leaders had been scheduled to be produced today, but all of them could not be taken to the court due to some technical reasons.        
	Additional director-general of police Nilmani said Viveka Yadav was a hardcore Naxalite, while others were relatively less dangerous.

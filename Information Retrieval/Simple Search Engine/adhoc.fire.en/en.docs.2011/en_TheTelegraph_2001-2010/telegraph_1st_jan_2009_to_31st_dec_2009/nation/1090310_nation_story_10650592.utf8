	Bhubaneswar, March 9: Classes resumed at Utkal Universty of Culture today, bringing to respite thousands of students who had to miss 65 days of their academic session due to a strike since January 3.        
	The temporary staff of the 10-year-old university had gone on a pen-down strike since January 3, demanding regularisation of jobs and probe into irregularities in the varsity.         
	Students later joined the employees by locking the campus, demanding better infrastructure, well-qualified faculties and the removal of the vice-chancellor, alleging him of corruption and mismanagement. The students, after failing to convince the culture minister and the governor, had formed the Utkal University of Culture Suraksha Committee. A six-member student delegation of Utkal University of Culture had also left for New Delhi to meet the UGC chairman.

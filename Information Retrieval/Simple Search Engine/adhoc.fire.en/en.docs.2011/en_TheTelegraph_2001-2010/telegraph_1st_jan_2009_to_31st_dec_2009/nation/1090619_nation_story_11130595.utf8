          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ahmedabad, June 18: The Indian Institute of Management here has designed a new course on cost-cutting, to be introduced next month, to specifically address the economic slowdown.        
	Considering the prevailing economic situation, we have specifically designed this course (strategic cost management programme) on how to reduce costs, IIM Ahmedabad dean B.H. Jajoo said.        
	The B-school will introduce two other programmes, on insurance and publishing. It feels these industries need more innovation and marketing.        
	IIM-A director Samir Barua hoped the new education minister, Kapil Sibal, would not form the Pan-IIM board, to which the Ahmedabad institute is opposed. The proposed board is to oversee the functioning of all the IIMs, superseding their existing, individual boards.

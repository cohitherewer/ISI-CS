	Patna, June 1 (PTI): The Bihar unit of Congress today initiated disciplinary action against leaders alleged to be involved in anti-party activities during the just-concluded Lok Sabha polls.        
	Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee has constituted a five-member committee to probe into the charges made by party candidates and cadre that some Congress leaders had campaigned against official nominees during the general polls.        
	Jyoti, the chairperson of the probe committee, said that the committee has decided to write to all Lok Sabha candidates, asking them to name the office-bearers, leaders, MLAs, former MLAs, MPs and former MPs who may have campaigned against them. None would be spared and strict action would be taken against the erring leaders, said Jyoti.        
	The committee today considered the complaint of Maharajganj parliamentary constituency candidate Tarkeshwar Singh who had alleged that one senior office-bearers worked against the party interest. The team also took up complaints of candidates who had alleged that a former BPCC president had indulged in anti-party activities during campaign time.

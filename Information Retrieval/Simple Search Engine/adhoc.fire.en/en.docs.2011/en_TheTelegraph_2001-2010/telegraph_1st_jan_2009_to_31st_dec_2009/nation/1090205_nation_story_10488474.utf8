	Hyderabad, Feb. 4: A Toyota engineer from Andhra has been murdered in Atlanta, the tenth person from the state to have been killed in the US in the past 16 months.        
	Rudraraju Sudhir Kumar was shot dead on Tuesday night, apparently resisting thugs trying to snatch his money and wristwatch on the way to his apartment.         
	Bystanders rushed the 31-year-old Kumar to hospital, US police told his parents in Hyderabad, and mentioned bleeding as the cause of his death.        
	Kumar, whose family hails from East Godavari, had come to Hyderabad last month and returned only 10 days ago to the US, where he had been working for nine years.         
	His sister Bindu Madhavi studies at Georgia University.

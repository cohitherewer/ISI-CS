	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 15: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik started finalisation of a five-year perspective plan for fulfilling the BJDs electoral promise of rejuvenating the irrigation sector.        
	The state government attaches utmost priority to irrigation and has made highest allocation in this years budget for this.         
	The party had promised in its electoral manifesto to provide irrigation to at least 35 per cent agricultural land in each of 314 blocks. In this context, an ambitious Rs 10,000 crore perspective plan was finalised for the next five years with a target of creating an additional irrigation potential in 5.60 lakh hectares of land.        
	The draft perspective plan was approved at a high-level meeting, chaired by Naveen, here last evening. The massive plan envisages construction of major, medium and minor irrigation projects, drainage in waterlogged areas and flood control.        
	In the next five years, 7,739 lift-irrigation points, 494 minor irrigation projects, 30 medium and major irrigation projects would be set up. Another 5.17 lakh hectares of command area would be transferred to the 10,853 pani-panchayats (water user associations managing lift-irrigation points). Two lakh farmers would be trained to run the pani-panchayats, said water resources secretary S.C. Mohapatra.        
	A target was set to extend irrigation facilities to 35 per cent of cultivable land in every block during the next two years. Water resource department officials said irrigation facilities would be available from Rengali left canal and Subernarekha irrigation project by June next year.

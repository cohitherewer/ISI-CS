The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Fetters await free education agency
                                                                                                               Fetters await free education agency
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, July 29: The new independent higher education accreditation authority promised by Kapil Sibal may remain crucially dependent on the human resource development ministry in the selection of its members, potentially limiting its autonomy in taking decisions.         
	Unlike the proposed National Commission for Higher Education and Research (NCHER) to regulate higher education, the promised accreditation body is likely to be picked through an HRD ministry selection process, top government officials have said.        
	The indications have come from the first draft of the National Authority for Regulation in Accreditation of Higher Educational Institutions Bill, 2009, to create the new agency. The Telegraph has access to the draft.         
	HRD minister Sibal, announcing his 100-day agenda of action, had promised an independent authority for mandatory accreditation of all higher educational institutions along with the NCHER to subsume Indias myriad regulators.         
	The NCHER, proposed by the Yash Pal panel on higher education, will consist of members selected by the Prime Minister, leader of the Opposition and the Chief Justice of India, assisted by a collegium of academicians.        
	The ministry, which normally appoints selection panels to make key appointments, will be left largely without a role in the choice of NCHER members under the governments planned implementation of the Yash Pal panels report.        
	But the new accreditation authority, while reducing government role in accrediting institutions, is likely to be constituted under the watch of the ministry, sources said. The draft bill envisages the authority as a five-member body headed by a chairperson, who must be a former vice-chancellor or director of an institution of national importance like Delhi University or the IITs.        
	Two other members must be academicians with at least 15 years experience as professors. It will also be required to have a woman and a legal expert with 15 years experience, according to the draft bill.         
	But unlike the NCHER, the authority to regulate accreditation is likely to be selected by a panel picked by the ministry  like in the appointments of central university vice-chancellors.         
	Ministry sources argued that it would be impossible for top constitutional authorities, like the Prime Minister or the Chief Justice of India, to vet all important educational appointments.         
	The idea is that the ministry will set in place a selection process for picking members of the planned authority. The Prime Minister or the Chief Justice of India need not be involved, an official said.        
	The new accreditation regime proposed under the draft bill will allow private agencies entry into education rating, and will arm institutions with the power to choose the examining agency it trusts.         
	At present, the government only recognises the quality checks of the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) for technical education institutions, and of the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) for other institutions.         
	The draft bill does not discuss the future of these two government agencies after the creation of the new authority, but sources confirmed that they may be allowed to continue. An institution should have the opportunity to choose which agency it wants to go to for its rating. Why should institutions be bound to go only to the government agency, a source argued.         
	The authority, according to the draft bill, will lay down rules that all private rating agencies will have to follow.         
	The responsibility of the authority, the draft bill states, will include the regulation of agencies involved in accreditation of higher educational institutions. It will issue licences to private rating agencies it believes meet required standards.         
	The new body will also set guidelines for the accreditation process to ensure that all rating agencies evaluate the same set of parameters and grant the same weightage to each parameter while examining institutions.

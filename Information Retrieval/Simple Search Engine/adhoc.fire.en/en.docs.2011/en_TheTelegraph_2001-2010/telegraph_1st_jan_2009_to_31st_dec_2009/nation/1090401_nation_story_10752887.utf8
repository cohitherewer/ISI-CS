	Calcutta, March 31: An air passenger flipping through a book showing hooded, gun-toting young men with backpacks triggered a terror alarm on a Calcutta-bound plane this morning.        
	The Air India flight, taxiing at Delhi airport, was brought back to the parking bay and security personnel boarded it to surround the suspect.        
	Only then did the passenger reveal all  he was a commando from the elite Special Protection Group and the book was an SPG training manual.        
	The flight, already delayed half an hour by fog, took off with all the 104 passengers, including the commando, another 65 minutes later.        
	The aircraft was approaching the runway around 7.30am when the commando, who sat in one of the rear seats, immersed himself in the book, Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) sources said from Delhi. The manual contained pictures of SPG weapons training and separate pictures of firearms and ammunition.        
	What are you doing with this book? a passenger asked him, a BCAS official said. The commando told the passenger it was nothing to do with him.        
	The passenger, now even more suspicious, drew the cabin crews attention. Since the commando steadfastly refused to identify himself, the crew alerted the captain.        
	The captain immediately turned the aircraft round and brought it back to the parking bay and informed airport security, the official said.        
	I saw the captain step out of the cockpit and rush towards the aircrafts rear. Then security personnel boarded the aircraft and surrounded a passenger, a passenger said. The BCAS official said: The passenger (commando) revealed his identity and was allowed to fly. The flight took off at 8.35am and arrived in Calcutta around 10.45.        
	Once the pilot was alerted about the passenger behaving strangely, he could not take the risk of flying, an Air India spokesperson said in Calcutta.        
	SPG commandos are not expected to reveal their identity, so no action can be taken against the commando for failing to clear the air at the outset.

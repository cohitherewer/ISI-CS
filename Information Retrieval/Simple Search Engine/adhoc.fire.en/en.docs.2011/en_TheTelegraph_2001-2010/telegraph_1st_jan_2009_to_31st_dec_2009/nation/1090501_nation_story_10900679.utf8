	Patna, April 30: Gruelling two phase over, it was time to relax in the third and final phase of polling today.         
	A handful of polling staff were spotted leisurely munching on their samosas and gossiping with the two voters  a man and his mother  who turned up to cast their votes finally at 2.40pm at a booth on AN College grounds, Barh, 75km from Patna, of Munger Lok Sabha constituency.         
	The college had two booths on its premises, both remained relatively empty.        
	At booth numbers 115 and 116, 230 of the expected 1,011 voters and 300 of the total 1,178 voters, respectively, had cast their votes by 2.40pm, giving enough indication that the polling was taking place at a snails pace in the region.        
	A temperature of 42C and a disappointed batch of voters irked by the fact that Barh seat was merged with Munger, turned up in small numbers to vote in this region. Barh was a separate constituency before delimitation. It lost its existence and was integrated with Munger after the delimitation.         
	We feel let down as we have lost our constituency, said Birendra Mohan, soon after casting his vote here.         
	Low polling was not a general trend today, as the states 11 Lok Sabha constituencies that went to polls in the third phase recorded 50 per cent polling against 41 and 47 per cent in the past two phases, according to the principal home secretary, Afzal Amanullah.         
	Amanullah described todays polling as relatively free, fair and peaceful.         
	He mentioned that police had to resort to firing in the air at three places of Katihar and Araria Lok Sabha constituencies to neutralise agitated crowds. But there was no casualty recorded and no one was injured in any of the incidents, he added.         
	Over 200 people trying to create mischief in and around polling booths were arrested across the constituencies.         
	Some of the noted candidates in the poll fray today were JD(U) president Sharad Yadav, former Union external minister of state and JD(U)s rebel candidate Digivijay Singh, Pappu Yadavs wife and mother, Ranjita Ranjan (RJD) and Shanti Priya (Independent), respectively, RJDs Taslimuddin and BJPs Shah Nawaj Hussein.         
	The constituencies that went to the polls included Munger, Banka, Bhagalpur, Begusarai, Khagaria, Purnea, Kishenganj, Araria Madhepura Supaul and Katihar.

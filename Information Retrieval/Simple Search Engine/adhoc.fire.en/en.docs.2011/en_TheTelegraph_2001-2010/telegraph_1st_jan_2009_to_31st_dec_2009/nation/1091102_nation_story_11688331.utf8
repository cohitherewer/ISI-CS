The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pilots contest 6-month rule
                                                                                                               Pilots contest 6-month rule
                            
	New Delhi, Nov. 1 (PTI): A group claiming to represent over 790 pilots of Jet Airways has taken the carrier and the government to court over a rule that requires a notice period of six months for quitting the airline.        
	According to the civil air requirement, pilots have to serve out a six-month notice period before leaving an airline.        
	The Delhi court has admitted the petition of the Society for Welfare of Indian Pilots and issued notices to the Centre, the directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA) and Jet Airways.        
	The society alleged that many airlines, including Jet Airways, were misusing the requirement, which provided an unfair advantage to the management.        
	Airlines, including Respondent 3 (Jet Airways), have sought to misuse the provisions of the impugned notification and have imposed a compulsory notice period of six months on pilots, the society said.        
	The requirement is being misused by air operators who have unilaterally started changing the terms and conditions of service of pilots and also reduced their salaries and other emoluments in the garb of recession.        
	The association said the DGCA had issued a clarification to Jet Airways on April 22, that if any service condition was altered or amended, the requirement would not apply. However, even after the clarification being issued by DGCA, private airlines, including Jet Airways, have refused to relieve their pilots from service or issue no-objection certificates, the association said.        
	It said the requirement was introduced in 2005 when aviation was booming and carriers were competing each other to get pilots. However, such circumstances have changed dramatically now.        
	In the present scenario, the terms and condition of employment of the pilots have been drastically altered by airlines, including Jet, resulting in not only loss of earnings of the pilots but also loss of growth opportunities, the association said.        
	This left the pilots with no option but to resign from such airlines and seek better opportunities, it added.

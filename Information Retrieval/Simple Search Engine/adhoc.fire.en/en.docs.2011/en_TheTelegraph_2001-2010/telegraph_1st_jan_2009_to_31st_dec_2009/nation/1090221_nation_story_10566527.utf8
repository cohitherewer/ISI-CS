          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 20: The Orissa government and the Centre have now set their eyes on hydro power, keeping in mind its low generation cost.         
	The state plans to sign an MoU with the central PSU National Hydro Power Corporation (NHPC) to set up 12 medium hydro plants with an investment of Rs 10,000 crore.         
	Earlier, the government had signed MoUs with 21 private power companies to set up plants with an aggregate capacity of 27,000MW and involving an investment of Rs 1.20 lakh crore.         
	Talking to The Telegraph, energy minister Surya Naraya Patro said a round of discussion with NHPC chairman-cum-managing director S.K. Garg was held yesterday.         
	A formal MoU will be signed between the government and NHPC within the next two months, said the minister. Orissa has a huge potential for hydro power as it has several major rivers. Hydro power units are less polluting, he said.         
	Patro said the state has decided to set up at least 12 medium hydro power stations to generate 2,000MW.         
	The proposed projects will be set up at Middle Kolab, Tel and Lower Vanshadhara basin, Salki, Khadago, Balijhari, Utairaul, Mahandai-Brahmani river link, Barmul and Sindhol, keeping in mind least submergence of human habitations and agricultural land. While state-owned Orissa Hydro Power Corporation will hold 49 per cent share of the projects, NHPC will have 51 per cent stake.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 16: A programme on trafficking held today revealed that the practice was on the rise in the state.         
	Instances of trafficking for either labour or prostitution were especially acute in poorer districts such as Kalahandi, Bolangir, Mayurbhanj, Balasore, Ganjam, Gajapati, Sundergarh, Puri, Bhadrak and Kandhamal.         
	The programme titled Prevention of child trafficking in Orissa saw experts from government and non-government organisations discuss the problem and its prevention.        
	Although it hasnt become a crisis as yet, the present numbers are not encouraging, said the states women and child development secretary, Mona Sharma.         
	As many as 41 trafficking cases were registered in several police stations in the year 2007 alone.         
	Though the Centre-sponsored scheme, Kishori Shakti Yojana, should curb the growing crime to some extent, the secretary emphasised that awareness.        
	The scheme would be implemented through anganwadi centres and would help form balika mandals where exchange of information regarding the problem would be undertaken.

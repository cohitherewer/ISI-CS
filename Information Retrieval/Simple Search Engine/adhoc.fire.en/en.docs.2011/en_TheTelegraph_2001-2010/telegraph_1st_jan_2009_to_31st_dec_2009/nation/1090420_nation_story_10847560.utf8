The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | A Colcata that Calcutta forgot
                                                                                                               A Colcata that Calcutta forgot
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI IN COLCATA CHAR                              
	One lakh Bengali speakers living on a cluster of the Gangas islands sandwiched between Jharkhand and Bengal are the nowhere people of this election.        
	Their land records are filed with the Malda authorities in Bengal but come April 23, they will be taking the boat to Jharkhand to vote in the election from Rajmahal constituency.        
	After that, the predominantly Muslim residents of these 20-odd islands or chars say, they will be stateless again till the next election.        
	Mohammed Naqir lives on one of these islands, Colcata Char, named after the Bengal capital. He and fellow residents say the Bengal governments indifference towards them makes the name sound like a mockery.        
	Hardly any major political leader or government official ever visits these islands, spread over 850sqkm and about a 90-minute boat ride from the Malda mainland, despite their desperate need for schools, hospitals, electricity and water.        
	Badshu Sheikh, headman of Badshu Char, remembers how his village once participated in Maldas boisterous electoral politics, led by the late A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhury.        
	Till the 1960s, most of the chars were contiguous with Malda but the Gangas depredations during the time the Farakka Barrage was being built cut them off from the mainland.                
	Badshu says that except for one of the islands  Narayanpur Char, which has traditionally voted CPM  the Bengal government washed its hands of the rest, strongholds of Ghanis Congress, in the mid-80s.        
	After years of neglect, Colcata Char residents Ekramul Sheikh and Kuddus Sheikh say, the villagers got themselves registered as voters with Udwa block of Sahibganj district in Jharkhand (earlier Bihar), hoping for some development.         
	Badshu, who has land records from Malda dated 1975, also holds voter I-cards for Rajmahal constituency issued in 1995  without any official delimitation by the Election Commission. So do Ekramul and Kuddus.        
	Which is why these villagers are discussing the relative merits of Thomas Hansda, the Rashtriya Janata Dal candidate from Rajmahal, and sitting Jharkhand Mukti Morcha MP Hemlal Murmu.        
	Jharkhand appears to be slowly moving towards officially claiming these islands, having carried out some cursory development such as opening a few Anganwadi schools and building brick roads. In these schools, the Bengali residents younger generation is learning Hindi.        
	One of them  teenager Samaul Haque from Piarpur Char, which officially falls under Maldas Kaliachak-2 block  wants a high school built on his island but knows theres little hope of that.        
	With no police station either, the islands are a den of corruption and crime, used as hideouts by Maoists and local criminals.        
	Yes, these villagers have big problems, MP Murmu said. We had approached Jharkhand revenue minister Dulal Bhuyan to get the area surveyed but it didnt happen. We need co-operation from Bihar and Bengal to do that.        
	He, however, insisted: All this is Jharkhand land.        
	Malda district magistrate Sridhar Ghosh said the islands were part of the various blocks in Malda but declined to say anything more on the disputed land before the polls.        
	Yes, Jharkhand and Bengal both claim this contentious land, said the sitting MP from Malda, Abu Hashem Khan Chowdhury. The Congress leader, this time candidate from Malda South, accepted he had been ignoring the matter for the past two years but pledged to act after the polls.        
	I had earlier taken up the problem with Writers Buildings but nothing came of it. Now I am going to insist on the Centres intervention.        
	Kedar Mondol, president of the Ganga Bhangan Pratirodh Action Nagarik Committee, an NGO in Malda, has been fighting for the rights of erosion victims for a decade. He accused Bengals politicians of making promises only to forget them.        
	So Naqir of Colcata Char is doing the best he can for himself. He wants a ration card and is arguing with motorcycle-borne campaigners for CPM candidate Jatin Soren and threatening to vote for the RJD.        
	Naqirs distant cousin, boatman Mokim Sheikh, however, has his hand firmly on the rudder. He will go and vote for Khan Chowdhury on April 30. Many like him, such as NGO worker Khadir Baksh, have abandoned their land on the river and settled inland in Malda.        
	Others like Ekramul, having lived through the stateless years in fear of being branded Bangladeshis, say they now feel safe with Lalu Prasads assurance of protection: Yeh Mussalman sab mere aadmi hain (these Muslims are all my people).              
	 Colcata Char and its 20-odd neighbouring islands on the Ganga vote in Jharkhands Rajmahal constituency on April 23

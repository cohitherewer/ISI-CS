The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Uma cant rob Scindia of sleep
                                                                                                               Uma cant rob Scindia of sleep
          JAYANTH JACOB IN SHIVPURI (MP)                           Uma, Scindia: Big fight				                                 
	Uma Bhartis foot soldiers are campaigning hard but Jyotiraditya Scindia isnt losing any sleep.        
	He will win, say supporters of the Gwalior royal.        
	In Guna, a constituency of a little over 11 lakh voters where the name Scindia arouses instant veneration, victory is perhaps not in doubt for the Harvard-educated 38-year-old.        
	What is being talked about rather is the tougher-than-expected fight the Congress candidate is facing from workers of the party founded by Uma, the village girl his late grandmother Vijaya Raje Scindia had picked, impressed by her knowledge of the epics and leadership potential.        
	Uma, who has declared her support for L.K. Advani, hasnt campaigned here personally. But the local BJP in Shivpuri, a town in Guna, has been buoyed by the efforts being put in by cadres of the Bharatiya Jana Shakti Party, the outfit the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister floated after her expulsion from the BJP for rebelling against the brass.        
	Its not a question of how much influence Umajis party has here. The very efforts of her party workers show we are giving a fight, says Om Prakash Gupta, BJP candidate Narottam Mishras campaign in-charge.        
	While Guna legislator Rajendra Singh Saluja belongs to Umas party, BJP big guns like party chief Rajnath Singh, M. Venkaiah Naidu, Sushma Swaraj and chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan have all campaigned for Mishra, a five-time MLA.        
	No one here in Guna  where Jyotiradityas late father Madhavrao Scindia made it a habit of winning  dares to call it a close fight. But as he leaves Bombay Kothi, the summer palace of the Scindias, Jyotiraditya says no one takes elections lightly.        
	Its 10 in the morning and, after a brief chat with reporters, Jyotiraditya gets into his SUV, which purrs down the road before picking up speed.        
	The vehicles behind start one by one  for another days gruelling campaign.        
	Packed in Jyotiradityas lunchbox are rolls, both veg and non-veg. He also has his favourite campaign drink with him  nimbu pani.        
	Although victory seems certain for Jyotiraditya  who won by 86,000 votes in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections  he cannot, as he says, take it easy.        
	Of the eight Assembly seats, the BJP has six and the Congress just one, says Rajendra Nigam, a district office-bearer of the BJP. The Congress had four MLAs when parliamentary elections took place in 2004, adds Nigam.        
	Jyotiraditya is aware of the statistics. I am banking on the development plank. I have brought investment worth Rs 2,100 crore to the constituency, he says.        
	 Guna votes on April 30

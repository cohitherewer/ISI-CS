The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mining scam protests grow louder
                                                                                                               Mining scam protests grow louder
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, July 13: Opposition Congress and BJP members stalled the proceedings of the Assembly today demanding a CBI probe into the alleged Rs 4,000-crore mining scam in Keonjhar.         
	Angry members stormed the well and kept on disrupting proceedings, forcing four adjournments spanning over a period of more than four hours. They also boycotted the discussion on the budgetary demands of the school and mass education department as well as higher education department in protest as the government rejected their demand for a CBI inquiry.         
	Earlier, at the outset of the session the leader of the Opposition, Bhupinder Singh, wondered about the norms that the chief minister followed to order a vigilance probe into the alleged mining scam without taking the legislature into confidence, though the House was in session. If the government ordered a vigilance probe, why is it afraid of a CBI inquiry, he added.         
	Singh was supported by BJP legislature party leader K.V. Singhdeo, who claimed that they had material evidence and photographs to prove the claims. He and his party colleagues even showed some of the photographs taken by them during the visit.         
	As the Speaker did not allow a discussion during the question hour, Opposition members trooped into the well and shouted slogans against Naveen Patnaik and his government.         
	In a bid to mount pressure, senior BJP member and former minister Jainarayan Mishra moved a privilege notice against chief minister Naveen Patnaik and steel and mines minister Raghunath Mohanty for misleading the Assembly.         
	In a counter offensive, BJD members launched a scathing attack on the UPA government at the Centre for its step-motherly treatment towards flood-hit Orissa.         
	They alleged that Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee recently announced a waiver of Rs 1000 crore flood assistance for Bihar, while ignoring Orissa.         
	BJD members shouted slogans against Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the UPA, while demanding a resolution to be adopted in the Assembly condemning the Centres discriminatory treatment.        
	As the pandemonium continued, Speaker Pradip Kumar Amat adjourned the house till 3pm. In the afternoon, the House was adjourned twice for 30 minutes each as the Opposition continued the dharna pressing for a CBI probe into the mining scam.

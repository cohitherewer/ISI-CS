          CITHARA PAUL                           A first-time voter shows her marked finger in Delhi. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, May 7: Vote, and get a democracy discount.         
	Thats not any political partys slogan but a way to catch Delhis shoppers on polling day.         
	All that shopaholics needed to do to get the discounts was show the election ink mark on the finger.        
	The Delhi voter did not disappoint.         
	I had collected the names of all the hotels and shops that offered discounts and went there straight after voting. We were doubtful whether the offers were for real. But they all kept the promise, said first-time voter Shikha Aggarwal.        
	Food chain Bikanervala has a 15 per cent discount scheme in its restaurants from May 7-9 for anyone who has voted.        
	Several shops in the high-end Khan Market offered discounts between 20 per cent and 50 per cent. Bookstore Full Circle and Cafe Turtle, also in Khan Market, had special purchase schemes for voters.         
	Spykar Lifestyles, a teenage apparel brand, Lifestyle, a retail store, and You, a store for women in Lajpat Nagar, had discounts varying from 10 to 20 per cent.        
	Some voters used the day to pamper themselves as beauty parlours in Khanna Market, Connaught Place and Lajpat Nagar had special packages, including manicure and pedicure.         
	Splash Water, an amusement park, offered a rebate of Rs 100 for whoever flashed the poll finger with the ink mark.         
	Multiplex chain PVR Cinemas offered discounts on combo meals. We went for a movie after voting. It was a great day. We hope there are more elections, laughed Anamika Gupta, who went to Bikanervala after the movie.

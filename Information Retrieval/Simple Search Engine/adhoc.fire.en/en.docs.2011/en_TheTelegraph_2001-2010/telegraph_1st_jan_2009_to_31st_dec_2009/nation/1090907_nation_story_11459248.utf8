          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Sept. 6: After retaining power at the Centre, the Congress will fight it alone in the Bihar bypoll, targeting the NDA, led by chief minister Nitish Kumar, and former ally RJD.        
	The Congress is a natural choice for Bihar voters who have gone through 15 years of RJD rule and have received a chance to judge the JD(U) for the past four years, said Congress national spokesman Shakeel Ahmed.         
	That Congress is taking Bihar seriously is evident from the fact that the party has pressed senior leaders such as Salman Khurshed, Jitin Prasad and Jagdish Tytler, seen campaigning in 18 Assembly constituencies going to polls on September 10 and 15. Despite doing well in Lok Sabha polls elsewhere, Sonia Gandhis party suffered badly here, managing to win only two seats. The party contested the poll alone, dumped by RJD-LJP combination.         
	Party sources said that the Congress was using the current by-poll to measure its strength in the state. If the party does relatively well, it will contest the next Assembly polls on its own, said a senior party leader.         
	Despite the Congresss battle cry, the by-poll fight is all set to boil down to Nitish Kumar-led NDA and Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan led RJD-LJP combination. The two political formations have their cadre and structure in place at the grassroots and share among themselves the vote majority.         
	If last polls are anything to go by, the battle would be between Lalu and Nitish and observers dont see any change in the political situation four months after the LS polls to indicate otherwise.        
	Vigorous campaigners that they are, Lalu and Nitish have been fanning out in the remote hinterland.         
	While Lalu is still said to have votes of the numerically preponderant Yadavs (17 per cent of the population) and a section of Muslims, he expects the Congress to cut into NDAs upper caste vote.         
	Congress leaders argue that their party will emerge an alternative, but the party has lost cadre and structure in 28 of the 38 districts.

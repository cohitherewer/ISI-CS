          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 27: The Opposition today lambasted the Naveen Patnaik government for overall failure.        
	This government has failed on all fronts and has not fulfilled its electoral promises, alleged Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh at the Assembly today.        
	No major industrial project has come up in the state, everyday farmers are committing suicide due to crop loss and debt burden and people are unsafe because of deteriorating law and order and growing Maoist menace, he observed, while initiating a debate on the appropriate bill relating to supplementary budget of Rs 2,799.59 crore for the current fiscal.        
	Referring to the electoral promise made by Naveen to the people to protect their rights on water, land and forest, Singh said all had been broken. Industrial houses  not farmers  were being allotted water from Hirakud and Rengali dams. Fertile lands were being snatched away from farmers for industrial projects, while tribals were being evicted from their homes for industrial and mining projects, he said.        
	Countering the attack, BJD members highlighted achievements of the government. Even BJD member Pravat Tripathy said Opposition Congress was suffering from jaundice, for which they failed to see the achievements.        
	Dubbing their government as pro-farmer and pro-tribal, the ruling BJD members highlighted on the governments target to irrigate at least 35 per cent agricultural land, constitution of a farmers commission and distribution of forest land patta to tribals.

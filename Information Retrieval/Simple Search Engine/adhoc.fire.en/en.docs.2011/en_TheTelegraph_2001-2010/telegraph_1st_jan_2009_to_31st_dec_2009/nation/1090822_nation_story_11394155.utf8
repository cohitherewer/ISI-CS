          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 21: The ongoing tussle between the Dongria Kondh tribe and British mining giant Vedanta Resources over mining in the Niyamgiri hills has come under the scanner of the National Human Rights Commission.        
	The NHRC has asked the Orissa government to submit a full report into its joint venture mining project with Vedanta Resources. The NHRC has taken up the cause following a complaint submitted by Survival, an international NGO working for tribal rights. The matter has been brought to our notice and the commission has asked the state government to give a detailed account of the situation, said an officer with the commission.        
	The issue had got international media attention because of the involvement of the Church of England in the project. The Church had invested in the companys stocks and a number of celebrities, including actress Joanna Lumley, human rights campaigner Bianca Jagger and writer Arundhati Roy, had taken up the cause of Dongria Kondh tribals. The tribals had been opposing the mining plan, as the proposed site is sacred to the Dongria Kondh tribes, who believe that it is the abode of their deity Niyam Raja.        
	Survival International had complained to the NHRC that Dongria Kondhs human rights, including their religious freedom, would be violated if their most sacred site is desecrated by the mine.        
	Vedanta is majority-owned by Indian billionaire Anil Agarwal.        
	Meanwhile, the Church of England has agreed to meet Vedantas management to discuss the issues raised by human rights campaigners. Though the Churchs investment in Vedanta stock is relatively small at 2.5 million, but a divestment would be a massive victory for campaigners.         
	Vedanta argued that the project was cleared by the Supreme Court and claimed it would benefit locals.         
	The Supreme Court, in its decision to approve the project, has taken account of the views of the tribals and the many benefits in terms of employment, education and healthcare, that the project will bring, the company said in a statement.

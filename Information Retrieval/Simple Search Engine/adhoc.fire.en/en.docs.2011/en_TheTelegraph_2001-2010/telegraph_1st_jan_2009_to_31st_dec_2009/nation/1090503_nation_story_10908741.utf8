The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sharad upset
                                                                                                               Sharad upset

	New Delhi, May 2: Janata Dal (U) chief Sharad Yadav today said he was upset with speculation that Narendra Modi was ally BJPs candidate for Prime Minister.        
	There is no vacancy for the Prime Ministers post. We have all endorsed L.K. Advanis candidature. Why are you talking about what will happen after 100 years? he asked.        
	He wondered how leaders of the BJP, which claimed to be a disciplined party, could talk out of turn. Even Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, who had stopped the BJP from sending Modi to campaign in Bihar, had refused to entertain any question on the matter, he pointed out.        
	Yadav said it did not augur well for the BJP to talk about Modi after projecting Advani as the Prime Minister candidate.         
	He praised the Lefts role in the UPA government, saying he did not agree with the Prime Ministers criticism of its former ally. Most of the UPAs welfare schemes were launched because of the Lefts interventions, he claimed. The country would have been on the streets in five years but for the Lefts constructive interventions, he said.

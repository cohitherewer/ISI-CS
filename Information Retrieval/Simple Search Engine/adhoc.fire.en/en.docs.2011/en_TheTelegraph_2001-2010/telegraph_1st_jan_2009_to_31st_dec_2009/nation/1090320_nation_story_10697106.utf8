The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rahul go solo gains ground
                                                                                                               Rahul go solo gains ground
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, March 19: Five years after the Congress celebrated Sonia Gandhis foresight, political understanding and skills for forging alliances, it is invoking Rahul to push the ekla chalo line.        
	The go-solo line is gaining currency after the RJD had it stumped in Bihar, talks with the Samajwadi Party bombed in Uttar Pradesh and NCP chief Sharad Pawar unveiled his prime ministerial aspirations.        
	Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan went into a huddle tonight to discuss the Congress threat to field candidates in all seats in Bihar. The Congresss central election panel may meet tomorrow, and Lalu Prasad and Paswan fear that the party may go it alone if a compromise is not found soon, sources close to the two leaders said.        
	Rahuls chat with journalists at a dhaba in March 2007 had been tapped by some Congress leaders to argue, weeks before the elections, why alliances are not such a great thing after all.        
	At the dhaba during his first Uttar Pradesh yatra before the 2007 Assembly elections, Rahul had described the Congresss 1996 alliance with the BSP as a total sellout and called it the single biggest reason for its decline in the heartland.         
	The then Prime Minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao, and Digvijay Singh, who was then the Madhya Pradesh chief minister and is now the general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh, had sewn up the partnership. Had a Nehru-Gandhi been at the helm, Rahul said, the alliance would not have happened.        
	Rahul said the right thing. We are glad his line prevailed in Uttar Pradesh this time and we hope it prevails in other states, a Maharashtra leader said.         
	Some Congress leaders said their initial view that Digvijay and some Uttar Pradesh leaders were scuttling the Samajwadi alliance was perhaps misplaced.         
	We have reasons to believe Rahul was not for it because he is clear that Uttar Pradesh should not go the Tamil Nadu way. If we are to revive, we should go it alone even if this means not doing too well in a couple of elections, an office-bearer said.        
	 An MP from Bihar said his workers were thrilled when word went out that the Congress would contest at least 25 of the states 40 seats.        
	The Congress in Maharashtra wants its leaders to sever ties with the NCP, arguing that the parties have fought all local body elections separately.         
	The alliance, said to be sealed after the Congress agreed to concede one seat more than in 2004, awaits an announcement because the district units have warned they would not work for the NCP.         
	Chief minister Ashok Chavan conveyed the workers sentiment to A.K. Antony, the leader in charge of Maharashtra. But Antony said it may be too late in the day to bite the bullet.         
	Underlying the alliance rethink in the Congress is its conviction that with the BJP in a bad way, it stands every chance of emerging as the single largest party.                     WITH INPUTS FROM NISHIT DHOLABHAI

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Dons to retire from poll fray
                                                                                                               Dons to retire from poll fray
          NALIN VERMA                          Shahabuddin, Pappu Yadav                                  
	Patna, March 3: Siwan was the pocket borough of RJD don Mohammed Shahabuddin, who has been representing north Bihars Lok Sabha seat on the Uttar Pradesh border for the past four terms.        
	The trigger-happy leader-cum-goon has never tasted defeat in any elections that he has contested in his career. But this year he may not even get a ticket to contest.        
	Shahabuddin contested the Zeeradei Assembly seat  a part of Siwan constituency  in 1990 and won it. He kept on winning from this seat  home to first President Rajendra Prasad  till the RJD found him worthy of Siwan, which he represented and won for the Lok Sabha.        
	Shahabuddin faces numerous convictions, including a life sentence, in four criminal cases. The party (RJD) that has been using Shahabuddin as a sure shot winner is now in a tight spot. RJD boss Lalu Prasad now faces the task of finding out a replacement for Shahabuddin whose name struck terror in the very heart of Siwan and whose firepower kept opponents at bay.         
	Like Shahabuddin, some six dons-turned-leaders, convicted in criminal cases, may not be able to contest the polls keeping it free from the presence of interesting politicians. The convicted leaders include RJDs Madhepura MP Rajesh Ranjan, alias Pappu Yadav, LJPs Ballia MP Surajbhan, former MP Anand Mohan, JD(U) MLAs Sunil Pandey and Rajan Tiwary and Munna Shukla, who had been eyeing the Lok Sabha polls for 2009.         
	A senior lawyer of Patna High Court, Dinesh Kumar Singh, said: Those convicted can enter the poll fray only when the high court or the Supreme Court suspends their conviction and grants them bail. Experts assert that even if they are granted bail, the leaders cannot contest unless their conviction is suspended.         
	Aware of this legal bar, the RJD boss has declared that he would not grant a ticket to Pappu Yadav this year. Indirectly, his announcement stands for Shahabuddin as well. LJPs Ram Vilas Paswan, too, is in trouble if he cannot field his trump card Surajbhan or find a replacement powerful enough. It is learnt that many of these dons are now trying to persuade their respective leaderships to field wives on their seats and maintain their hold on the seat by proxy.        
	Surajbhan is believed to be trying to convince boss Ram Vilas Paswan to field wife Veena Devi from Ujiarpur seat, while Mohammed Shahabuddin has given a feeler to Lalu Prasad to give Heena Shahab  the dons wife  a ticket from Siwan.         
	Pappu Yadav already has his Sikh wife, Ranjita Ranjan, playing her role as an LJP MP from Saharsa. An articulate woman and a former badminton player, she is the favourite to win the seat either from an RJD or an LJP ticket.        
	RJD spokesman Shakeel Ahmad Khan turned the heat on Nitish Kumar government. He said: The ruling establishment has taken special care of its people like Prabhunath Singh and Surajbhan, while weakening its opponents by getting their MPs convicted.

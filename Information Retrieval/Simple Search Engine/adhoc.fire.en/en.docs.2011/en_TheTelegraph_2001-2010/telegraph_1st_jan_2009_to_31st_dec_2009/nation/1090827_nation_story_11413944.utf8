The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bihar to have two swine flu labs
                                                                                                               Bihar to have two swine flu labs
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Aug. 26: The state government has decided to open two virology laboratories, one here and the other at Darbhanga, to examine swine flu cases.         
	These two labs will be a permanent solution to deal with the disease, which has of late affected hundreds of people in other parts of the country, state health minister Nandkishore Yadav said, adding: The state so far does not have such labs.        
	The Rajendra Medical and Research Institute is being used for investigating H1N1 cases for the time being.         
	The institute collects the suspected patients swab and blood and sends it for examinations at labs in Delhi or elsewhere.        
	Yadav, however, clarified that the swine flue situation in Bihar was not as alarming as in other states.         
	Government hospitals screened 669 people out of which samples of only 10 were sent for testing. Only one person out of 10 was found H1N1 positive.        
	The lone H1N1 positive case happens to be that of additional finance commissioner A. Santosh Mathew, who got the infection while he was in London.         
	With tamiflu being administered to him, his condition is fast improving, according to doctors attending on him.        
	The health department has also opened two helplines  numbers 102 and 1911  for procuring information about the treatment of the disease.         
	Besides two virology labs, which are likely to be functional in September, the government has opened cells to screen suspected swine flu patients in all medical colleges and 38 district sadar hospitals.        
	Fear factor        
	A pig farmer in Balia village in Jagatsinghpur district had to take refuge at Kujang police station along with his pigs after local people did not allow him to keep the animals fearing swine flu. The police later asked the farmer to get rid of his pigs or go out to a different place where he could keep them.        
	Incidents like this were brought to light by the Orissa Pig Farmers Association today. We are in a miserable condition. Our families and animals are being boycotted and we are facing the wrath of villagers for no reason at all, said Madhusudhan Patra, the association president.        
	The association members today met Damodar Rout, the minister of agriculture, and urged to take efforts to spread awareness.

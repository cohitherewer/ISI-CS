                                                                                    Saturday , November 14 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Cong vote share spikes in UP 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Raj Babbar: Clear winner                                  
	Lucknow, Nov. 13: The Congress has begun a recruitment drive for youths in Uttar Pradesh, buoyed by an increase in vote share in the majority of Assembly constituencies where byelections were held.         
	The party won a thumping victory in the Samajwadi Party stronghold of Firozabad, where actor Raj Babbar triumphed over Mulayam Singh Yadavs bahu Dimple, and wrested the Lucknow West Assembly seat, part of BJP patriarch Atal Bihari Vajpayees Lok Sabha constituency.         
	The Congress has seen its vote share go up in eight Assembly seats, a signal that the Rahul Gandhi effect is working wonders for the party in the state though six of its candidates have lost their deposits: in Etawah, Lalitpur, Jhansi, Padrauna, Kol Asla and Rari.         
	The Congresss share, which had fallen from 50 per cent in 1984 to 12.5 per cent last year, went up to 15.3 per cent in the Lok Sabha elections.        
	Though the numbers are still being worked out, back-of-the-envelope calculations by party managers suggest that the Congress has gained a further 3.5 percentage points in the bypolls, taking its share to over 18 per cent. Much of the gain has been at the expense of the Samajwadi Party.         
	Compared with the 2007 Assembly elections, the Congresss vote share has gone up in eight of the 11 Assembly segments where byelections were held and also in the Firozabad Lok Sabha constituency.         
	In Firozabad, the Congress got only 6,341 votes in the May Lok Sabha elections, but six months on, the tally zoomed to 3,12,728 votes. In Powayan, the Congress polled 31,322 votes in 2007, but in the bypolls, its candidate got 44,322 votes.         
	In Lucknow West, the party came third with 11,011 votes in 2007, but this time the Congress has won the seat, a BJP bastion, with 32,166 votes.         
	In Isauli, the party polled 8,794 votes in 2007, but has come second this time with 32,686 votes. In Bhartana, the Congress tally has risen from 3,270 in 2007 to 31,166 in 2009; in Lalitpur from 4,741 to 29,479; and in Hainser Bazaar from 3,462 to 39,018. Only in Rari has the increase been meagre, from 4,755 to 4,880 votes.         
	The partys share has declined in Jhansi, Padrauna, Etawah and Kol Asla.        
	Jhansi and Padrauna had been represented by Union ministers Pradeep Jain and R.P.N. Singh, before they were elected to the Lok Sabha this year.         
	We came second in the three Assembly seats and third in four others, said Viren Madan, a Congress spokesperson. It is time now to mobilise more youth voters and strengthen the organisation for Mission 2012 (the state polls).

          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                           Agatha: Humbled                                  
	New Delhi, May 27: A minister at 28, Indias youngest, Agatha Sangma feels humbled  but she is clear about her politics.        
	In other words, the NCP, the Congress, the coalition and her father P.A. Sangmas position vis--vis Congress president Sonia Gandhi.        
	Foreign origin was an issue blown out of proportion. I think it has followed my father longer than it should have, Agatha said today, soon after she came to know that Manmohan Singh had selected him for his council of ministers.        
	He has never opposed the suggestion of Rahul Gandhi as Prime Minister, Agatha added.        
	It was after Sangmas statement on Sonias foreign origin that the former Speaker fell out with the Congress.        
	But Agathas selection has come as a lifeline for the Garo leader who was gravitating towards the NDA. Sources said it had rekindled hopes of sustaining his and his familys political future.        
	Agatha said her selection was a collective decision of NCP leader Sharad Pawar, Manmohan and Sonia.        
	The youngest of four siblings in the Sangma household, she said being a minister at the Centre had humbled her.        
	Clear about her priorities, the young leader wants to integrate the Northeast with the rest of India. She also wants the Northeast included in educational syllabi.         
	We have leaders like Togan Nengmenja (a Garo Hills hero who fought the British) whose names should be known by others, said the lawyer-MP.

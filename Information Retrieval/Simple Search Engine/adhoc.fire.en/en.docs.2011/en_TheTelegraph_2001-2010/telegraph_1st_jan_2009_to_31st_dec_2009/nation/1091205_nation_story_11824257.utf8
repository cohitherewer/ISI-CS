The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | US prods India on Kabul
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      US prods India on Kabul
          SUJAN DUTTA                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 4: The chief of the US Pacific Command, Admiral Robert Willard, today said India had to decide if it wanted to expand its role  and take on a military responsibility  in Afghanistan with Washington having announced its surge-and-exit policy for the next 18 months.        
	Admiral Willard met top defence officials in New Delhi yesterday, including the chiefs of the army, navy and air force and the chief of the integrated defence staff, and exchanged briefings on the security situation around India.        
	A defence ministry official said there were also inquiries on the possible involvement of Indian military instructors for training Afghan National Army troops in commando operations but Willard did not mention this in a news briefing here today.        
	Asked if the US was satisfied with the level of Indias participation in the reconstruction of Afghanistan, Willard said: This is a subject we will continue to discuss with nations. The US and the coalition in Afghanistan are all interested in Afghanistan succeeding, Pakistan remaining stable and solving their own internal problems, and there is a sense of urgency in things being accomplished.         
	Asked if the US envisaged a military role for India, the admiral said he had not specifically sought one but it is for the Indian military and the Indian government to decide.        
	US President Barack Obama had road-mapped the policy on Afghanistan and that envisaged the assistance of many countries in addition to the troops surge by the US and co-operation by Pakistan which also had to stabilise, the admiral said.        
	Defence ministry sources said Indias focus would continue to be on humanitarian projects in Afghanistan but they pointed out that India had been giving assistance in rebuilding the Afghan National Army as well, by training its officers in Indian military institutions and by supplying non-lethal equipment. A deeper involvement of the Indian military in Afghanistan was something we will have to study, they said.        
	Indias role in Afghanistan will be described not only by Taliban attacks on Indian personnel and establishments  on telecom and security personnel, on a Border Roads Organisation project in Afghanistans south and two suicide attacks on the Indian embassy in Kabul  but also by New Delhis desire to increase its strategic footprint in Central Asia.         
	Pakistans objections to an Indian role in Afghanistan will also get more strident if New Delhi takes on a military responsibility  such as training  in Afghanistan even if it does not deploy Indian boots on the ground.

	 Mumbai (PTI): This isnt quite the rib-splitting joke that Raju Srivastav serially cracks on television laughter shows.          
	If things go to plan, Uttar Pradeshs Phulpur  this constituency sent Jawaharlal Nehru to the Lok Sabha  might see the laughter champ turning out in Congress colours.          
	I have been approached by Rita Bahuguna, the state Congress committee chief, to contest from Allahabad-Phulpur, Srivastav, 45, said.          
	I was shocked when I first heard the offer. I thought it was another joke, better than the ones I crack. But I was told it was a serious offer and I should consider it seriously.          
	Srivastav said Bahuguna had taken him to meet Congress chief Sonia Gandhi on Friday. Soniaji said she knows me from my TV shows. I told her I like her working style of taking along people from all sections of society.          
	The Congress has, however, not stopped with a comedian: it is angling for an ex-cricketer also. Sources said the party was mulling giving Himachals Hamirpur ticket to Madan Lal as its plans to bag Preity Zinta had come a cropper.                  
	 Berhampur (PTI): The PWD have begun turning, at last.          
	People with disability (PWD) in this Orissa town are clamouring for 3 per cent reservation in Parliament and assemblies because they feel political participation is the surest route to greater emancipation.          
	When smaller populations like Anglo-Indians who form less than 1 per cent of the population have two co-opted members in the Lok Sabha, why not we? asked a member of the Orissa Bikalanga Manch, a state-level organisation for the physically handicapped.          
	Our number is not less than 10 per cent of the total population, he claimed.                   
	 New Delhi (PTI): The lawkeepers are out with a magnifying glass to smoke out those who have been messing around with property.          
	Delhi police have registered over 200 FIRs against political parties, candidates and workers for defacing public property by putting up banners, hoardings and posters.          
	We have registered 212 FIRs so far. We will remove all banners and posters that are defacing public property in order to woo voters, a police officer said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Raiganj, Jan. 29: Three country-made bombs and three packets of white powder along with electronic circuits and a clock were found in a plastic bag underneath a seat at a cinema in Kishanganj this morning.        
	The white powder has been sent for forensic test. Police said had the bombs gone off, they could have injured at least 40 of the 1,000 people present at Metro Talkies.        
	SSB commandant of the 20th Battalion A.B. Ravindran said an anonymous caller had rung up the forces office in Kishanganj, 80km from here, after 11am and warned them about the packet. He told us that his feet had touched the packet kept under the seat, said Ravindran. The SSB came in plainclothes and asked the management to evacuate the cinema.        
	We called in our sniffer dogs and the packet was located beneath a seat in the first row of the dress circle. There were three round objects like country-made bombs wrapped with string and three packets of white powder, some electronic circuits and a clock in the bag, the commandant said. The bombs were immersed in a bucket of water. We do not know the nature of the white powder but we have sent it to forensics for identification. Had the bombs gone off  it is difficult to say if it would have exploded at all  then many would have been injured, said M.N. Naik, the SP Kishanganj. SSB sources said a circuit diagram was also found which had some phone numbers scribbled on it. Metro Talkies is located in Dey Market area of Kishanganj that is a congested.

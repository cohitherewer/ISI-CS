The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Amar fires M-gun
                                                                                                               Amar fires M-gun
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Maanyata: Good M                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 11: If Mayavati is the bad M, the Samajwadi Party has found its good M: Maanyata.        
	Amar Singh today tore into Congress leader Digvijay Singh for allegedly insulting actor Sanjay Dutts wife by pretending he did not know who Maanyata was.        
	The Samajwadis have announced Sanjay as their Lucknow candidate for the Lok Sabha polls, but added that Maanyata would be the back-up. Unless the Supreme Court upholds Sanjays appeal against his 93 blasts conviction, he cannot contest.        
	Digvijay, asked yesterday what he thought of Maanyata, was quoted as saying: Who is Maanyata? On being told, he allegedly said: Oh, Sanjay Dutts wife!        
	I never said, Who is Lakshman Singh? Oh, Digvijay Singhs brother who is in the BJP! Amar fumed at a news conference, party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav by his side.        
	If Lalu Prasads wife (Rabri Devi) could contest the polls despite her inexperience (when she entered politics), why cant Maanyata?        
	A Samajwadi-Congress tussle over Maanyata would be pure Bollywood. Maanyata apparently lies at the root of Sanjays estrangement from sister Priya, a Congress MP. The Congress had also made Sanjays father Sunil a Union minister and mother Nargis a Rajya Sabha member.        
	Amar, however, claimed Priya had welcomed our decision to field Sanjay and invoked Sunil and Nargis to appeal to the Congress to support Maanyata. Sanjay, out on bail and shooting in Jammu and Kashmir, said he hadnt decided anything yet.        
	Hit at Maya        
	Amar displayed a CD that allegedly contains phone conversations in which BSP leaders are heard asking party workers to collect money for Mayavati.        
	The CD has details of how Rs 20 lakh was collected by senior BSP leaders Tilak Chand Ahirwal and C.P. Singh and given to Delhi BSP leader Suresh Chand, Amar said.        
	The money, he alleged, was distributed among 39 party workers and local leaders, such as Delhi councillors, who were asked to send it to Mayavati in the form of bank drafts.

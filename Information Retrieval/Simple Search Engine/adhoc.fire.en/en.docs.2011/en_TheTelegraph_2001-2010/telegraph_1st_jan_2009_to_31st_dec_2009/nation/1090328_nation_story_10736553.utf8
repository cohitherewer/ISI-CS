	New Delhi, March 27 (PTI): The Supreme Court has granted three unrecognised southern parties a symbol each for the Lok Sabha polls, contrary to an Election Commission practice.        
	The poll panel had refused the three  the Praja Rajyam Party and the Lok Satta in Andhra Pradesh and the DMDK in Tamil Nadu  symbols as only recognised parties are entitled to common symbols for all seats.         
	To be classified as recognised and get a symbol, a party has to win at least six per cent of the total votes polled and should have won at least two seats in a state.        
	The Praja Rajyam will fight on the symbol of a rail engine, DMDK a drum and the Lok Satta a whistle. The court, however, said the symbols were only for the coming elections and the question of allotting symbols to unrecognised parties was open to debate.

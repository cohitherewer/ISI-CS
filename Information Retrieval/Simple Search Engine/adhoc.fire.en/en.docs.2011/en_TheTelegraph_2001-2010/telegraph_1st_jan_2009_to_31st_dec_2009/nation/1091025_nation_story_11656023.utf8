The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong sets up jumbo panels in Jharkhand
                                                                                                               Cong sets up jumbo panels in Jharkhand
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 24: The Congress today appointed two working presidents to assist Jharkhand unit chief Pradeep Balmuchu and set up jumbo election management committees that sources said were aimed at taking everybody along in the faction-riven state organisation.        
	The seven committees that have been formed comprise more than 100 members and include almost every notable Congress leader in the state, where the Election Commission yesterday announced five-phase polls from November 27.        
	While state Congress chief Balmuchu is a tribal Christian, sources said the partys decision to name Furkan Ansari and Rajendra Prasad Singh working presidents was aimed at tapping Bihari and Muslim votes.        
	The Congress Union minister from Jharkhand, Subodh Kant Sahay, has been made chairman of the 29-member campaign committee.         
	Prominent tribal leader Rameshwar Oraon will head the manifesto committee, and Krishnand Jha the media panel.        
	So desperate was the high command to accommodate all the aspirants that it formed committees for public meetings and logistics, panchayat conferences and also for cultural programmes.        
	The last-named panel, rare for electoral purposes, has 31 members and is headed by former Lok Sabha MP Bagun Sumrui.        
	K. Keshava Rao, the party leader in charge of Jharkhand, said the message in the huge committees was the Congress wanted to take everybody along.        
	Sources said the organisational machinery in the state, long under Presidents rule, was torn between factions and the high command woke up too late and had no option but to set up an umbrella structure involving all the prominent leaders.        
	Although the purpose is to keep the flock together, some leaders feared the warring factions had now been provided with the institutional mechanism to lock horns.        
	Balmuchu has also been appointed chairman of the 18-member election management committee.                                
	which includes senior leaders like Sahay, Manoj Kumar Yadav, Sarfaraz Ahmed, Ansari, Singh, Oraon and Mabel Rebello.        
	Newly elected Rajya Sabha MP Dheeraj Sahu has been made chairman of the 22-member printing and publicity committee.        
	Sources said party president Sonia Gandhi was thinking of asking some senior national leaders to oversee election management in the state, where a Congress victory will be another blow to the BJPs efforts to stop its unbroken downward slide.

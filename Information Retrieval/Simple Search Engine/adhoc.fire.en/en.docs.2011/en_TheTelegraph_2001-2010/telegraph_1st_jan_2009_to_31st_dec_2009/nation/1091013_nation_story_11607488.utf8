The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP lobs bribe letter from US
                                                                                                               BJP lobs bribe letter from US
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Meera Shankar                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 12: The BJP today asked the Prime Minister to act on a list of instances of US companies bribing Indian officials, purportedly sent to his office in May by Indias ambassador in Washington.        
	The Opposition party demanded punishment for the alleged bribe-takers, who include unnamed officials from the navy, railways, Maharashtra electricity board and PSUs. It asked why the Centre had sat on the purported May 12 letter from Meera Shankar, whose list was culled from a US report on corruption by American firms abroad.        
	You may like to take appropriate action to have these investigated at our end, said the letter attributed to Shankar, copies of which the BJP circulated today. The letter was addressed to T.K.A. Nair, the Prime Ministers principal secretary.        
	Indian government sources refused to confirm or deny the existence of such a letter, saying records were being checked.        
	However, one government source advised the BJP to verify its own records because some of the alleged corruption took place in 2000 and 2001, when the NDA was in power.        
	The US firms are accused of illegal payments to facilitate a range of operations, from settling civil charges and customs disputes to procuring business and speeding up registration. Most of the alleged bribes are of a few million or few hundred thousand dollars.        
	The copies of the letter distributed by the BJP mention that on January 9 this year, Mario Covino of Control Companies Inc, which makes industrial valves, pleaded guilty in America to making illegal payments of over $1 million to employees of state-owned entities in four countries. One of them is the Maharashtra State Electricity Board.        
	The letter attributed to Shankar cites how on February 14 last year, Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation settled civil charges allegedly through unlawful payments of $137,400 made over five years, from 2001 to 2005. The money was paid to railway employees allegedly by Pioneer Friction, Westinghouses wholly owned Indian subsidiary.        
	On October 1, 2007, York International Corporation agreed to pay fines in the US for making improper payments of over $7.5 million to secure orders in West Asia, China, Nigeria, Europe and India. The company is a global vendor of heaters, air-conditioners and refrigerators.        
	The letter said Yorks Indian subsidiary retained an agent to wangle after-installation service jobs and provide sales and marketing backup for equipment sold to the navy. An employee of the agent allegedly admitted to routinely paying off navy officials between 2000 and 2006. The letter said that though the payments were typically less than $1,000, the overall amount was $132,500 on 215 orders.        
	It added that Dow Chemicals paid $39,700 to an official on the central insecticides board to speed up the registration of three of its products. Other improper payments it allegedly made were $19,000 to unspecified government business officials, $11,800 to sales tax officials, $3,700 to excise officials and $1,500 to company officials.        
	BJP spokesman Prakash Javdekar asked: Why has the PM, who talks of fighting corruption, ignored the letter to his office? This revelation is the tip of the iceberg because we have a government that is mired in corruption.        
	The US report was released early this year.

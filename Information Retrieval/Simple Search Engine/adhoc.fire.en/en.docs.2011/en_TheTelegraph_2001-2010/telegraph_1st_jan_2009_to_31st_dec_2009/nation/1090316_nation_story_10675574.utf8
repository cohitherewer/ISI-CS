The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Debt too small for Delhi
                                                                                                               Debt too small for Delhi
  - Rules block patriot kin from cashing Rs 135 cheque        MANJEET SEHGAL WARRIOR                                    
	Shimla, March 15: When the country needed him in a crisis, Nath Ram had handed over his lifes savings, a meagre Rs 100 the government wasnt too proud to accept.        
	Fifty-five years on, when his impoverished family wants the loan repaid, a resurgent Indias proud banking rules stand in the way. The sum, it appears, is too ridiculously small for the government to find a way of handing the cash over.        
	Retired schoolteacher Nath Ram had put country before self when the Jawaharlal Nehru government issued a fervent appeal to all Indians during the economic downturn of 1954.        
	He deposited Rs 100 with the National Plan Loan to which all classes of people and institutions  from princes and business houses to the poor  were being asked to contribute.        
	The sum, to be returned with 3.5 per cent interest 10 years later, would have grown to Rs 135 in 1964.        
	But Nath Ram died in 1960 and the government  through three wars and 12 Prime Ministers, bank nationalisation and economic reforms  forgot all about the patriotic Indian from Saraha-Cheeuna village, 150km from Shimla.        
	Then in 2006, after his grandson Suresh Kumar, a peasant, had written several letters to the Centre, the Reserve Bank of India sent the family a cheque for Rs 135.        
	Inflation through 52 years had turned the amount into peanuts, but for the family of six, which earns less than Rs 2,000 a month, it was still substantial.        
	When Kumar approached the local State Bank of India branch with the cheque, he was told he needed to open a savings account depositing a minimum of Rs 1,000 to be able to cash it.        
	If the family had Rs 1,000, it would not have been so desperate for Rs 135, Kumar says.        
	My late grandfather had contributed Rs 100 to the National Plan Loan on April 19, 1954. A cheque for Rs 135 was sent by the RBI but we were unable to cash it, Kumar told The Telegraph.        
	We are a below-poverty-line family; we cannot open a bank account. This cheque is like a fruit which we cannot eat.        
	Had the amount been more than Rs 1,000, the family could have borrowed the money to open an account and returned it later. When the government awards large compensations to poor victims, it often helps them open a bank account and later deducts the money.        
	The family says the cheque means a lot to them since this is the only wealth left by Nath Ram. It also holds sentimental value as a reminder of their ancestors patriotism.         
	Kumar plans to send a legal notice to the government. The government had borrowed Rs 100 for 10 years but returned it after 52 years. So the interest should be Rs 182 instead of Rs 35.        
	However, even if the government sends Rs 282, Kumar would still be Rs 1,000 short of claiming it.

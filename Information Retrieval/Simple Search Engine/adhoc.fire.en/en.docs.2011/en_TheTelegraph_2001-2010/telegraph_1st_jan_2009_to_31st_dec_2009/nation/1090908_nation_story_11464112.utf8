The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP skips Jaswant panel meet
                                                                                                               BJP skips Jaswant panel meet
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 7: The BJP and its NDA allies today boycotted the first meeting of Parliaments public accounts committee, called by its chairman and expelled party MP Jaswant Singh.        
	Sushma Swaraj, deputy leader of the BJP parliamentary party, made a public appeal for Jaswant to resign as PAC chief. She said his refusal to resign on the ground that he was appointed by the Speaker and not his party did not cut ice in a parliamentary democracy based on the system of political parties.        
	This is not a valid argument. If the BJP did not nominate him (to the post), would the Speaker have unilaterally done it? The answer is No, Sushma told the media.        
	Till the third Lok Sabha, the PAC chairmans post used to be with the ruling party. Since the fourth Lok Sabha, it went to the principal Opposition party. One day, the Speaker called me and informed the party had to give a name by a certain date. We recommended Jaswant Singhs name.        
	Sushma said that since Jaswant had turned down her appeal last week to quit the post, she was again urging him to step down gracefully.

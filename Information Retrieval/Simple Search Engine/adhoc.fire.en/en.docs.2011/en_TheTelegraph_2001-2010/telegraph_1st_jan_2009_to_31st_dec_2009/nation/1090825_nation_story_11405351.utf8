	New Delhi, Aug. 24: BJP ally Janata Dal (United) today said the Narendra Modi governments move to ban Jaswant Singhs book in Gujarat was no solution.        
	There should be no ban on any book. After all, there are so many books on history. Freedom of speech cannot be curtailed in a democracy, Dal (United) chief Sharad Yadav (in picture) said. His apparent dig at Modi came on a day a petition against the ban was admitted in Gujarat High Court.         
	But Yadav, also the NDA convener who had once said ties with the BJP were not the same as they were in the Vajpayee era, was cautious on the turmoil within the ally, saying it was the partys internal matter.

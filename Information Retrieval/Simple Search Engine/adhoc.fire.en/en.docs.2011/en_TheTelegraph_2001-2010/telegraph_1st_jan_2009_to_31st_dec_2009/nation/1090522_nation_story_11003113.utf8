The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pay damages for pain: SC
                                                                                                               Pay damages for pain: SC
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, May 21: The Supreme Court has said courts should award monetary compensation to parents who lose their children in accidents for the pain they go through, over and above the lost prospective earnings.         
	Pecuniary damages seek to compensate losses which can be translated into money terms like loss of actual and prospective earnings, it said.         
	In contrast, non-pecuniary damages include such immeasurable elements as pain and suffering and loss of amenity and enjoyment of life. It becomes the duty of the court to award just compensation for non-pecuniary loss, a two-judge bench said.         
	The court was disposing of appeals filed by parents of children who died on November 18, 1997, when a bus plunged into the Yamuna off a bridge. Twenty-nine children died. The driver was held guilty of rash driving.        
	The parents  mostly from poor families  sought compensation under the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988. They argued that the children would have earned good salaries and helped them financially.        
	In December 2004, the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Delhi, awarded Rs 1,55,000 to the dependants of children between 10 and 15 years and Rs 1,65,000 for those between 15 and 18. Three children  Kailash Rathi, Neena Jain and Jatish Sharma  were under 10. For Kailash, a compensation of Rs 1,05,000 was awarded, for Neena Rs 1,30,000 and for Jatish Rs 1,31,000.         
	In arriving at the compensation, the tribunal took into account a notional income of Rs 15,000 per annum and deducted Rs 5,000 from it towards personal living expenses. A multiplier of 15 was then used for children below 15 years and a multiplier of 16 for children between 16 and 18 years.         
	The parents challenged this in the high court, which increased the compensation sum in all cases by Rs 75,000.         
	Some parents then moved the apex court, which said compensation should be paid for future loss of income but added that no amount of money could lessen the devastating effect of a loss of a child. The court then awarded the parents another Rs 75,000.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Last flurry of an isolated veteran at helm
                                                                                                               Last flurry of an isolated veteran at helm
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                          Arjun: Waiting for code relief                                  
	New Delhi, May 14: His party may be ignoring Arjun Singh, but not even the May 16 verdict for a new government is proving a roadblock to last-minute contentious decisions and appointments at the ministry where he is still boss.        
	The human resource development ministers last few days in charge of Indias education are shaping up as among his most hyperactive and controversial, mirroring his start in 2004 and belying his political isolation.        
	The ministry and the University Grants Commission plan to recommence granting deemed university status to institutes once the election model code of conduct lifts.        
	Top officials confirmed to The Telegraph that the UGC has called a meeting on May 18 to finalise deemed university status, though Indias mandate for a new government would be known by then.        
	The practice of granting deemed university status has been criticised by several government panels reviewing higher education.        
	Deemed universities are institutions identified by education regulators like the UGC as capable of growing into full-fledged universities.        
	Technically, the UPA government is in power till its successor is sworn in, and can take any decision except while the model code is in force.                    
	But senior education officials  current and retired  said the government, and the HRD ministry in particular, has in the past not taken major decisions following polls till a new government is sworn in.        
	It is a practice borne out of political morality. Once the countrys mandate for a new government is known, the outgoing government is merely holding on till the new dispensation takes over, an official explained.        
	The decision to grant deemed university status is, however, only the latest in a slew of controversial decisions sanctioned by Arjun.        
	In 2004, the veteran Congress leader started his second tenure as HRD minister  he was in charge for three years under P.V. Narasimha Rao  with a de-saffronisation campaign targeting education officials with perceived saffron leanings.        
	Arjuns tenure as HRD minister this time was marked by friction with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and growing isolation within the Congress for a man who was once a chief troubleshooter for the party.        
	The most telling signal of Arjuns dwindling prominence within the party came when both his son Ajay and daughter Veena were denied Congress tickets for the Lok Sabha elections from Madhya Pradesh.        
	Veena contested as an Independent and a dismayed Arjun, forced to choose between party and kin, even broke into tears at a public function.        
	Arjun aides say the minister is not expecting to be a part of the cabinet even if a Congress-led coalition returns to power.        
	But Arjun is spending more time in his Shastri Bhavan office these last few days of the government than he has over the past three years when he had been plagued by repeated ailments.        
	At a time when top politicians were criss-crossing the country in election campaigns, Arjun had been quietly attending his office even on Saturdays and, occasionally, on Sundays too, HRD ministry sources said.        
	It is rare to see a senior politician in his ministry when the country is in the midst of elections, a senior HRD ministry official remarked.        
	Controversies have shrouded a slew of hurried decisions he has taken over the past three weeks, amid allegations that Arjun is trying to reap all he can before his term ends.        
	A vice-chancellor, professor Ved Prakash, was appointed vice-chairman of the UGC despite allegations of caste discrimination against him during an earlier stint at the same institution. The cabinet secretariat raised questions over the decision but Arjuns ministry went ahead with the appointment.        
	Arjun also sanctioned a move allowing deemed universities to drop the prefix from their names, increasing the confusion for students trying to distinguish them from full-fledged universities.        
	A search committee was handpicked by Arjun to appoint a new vice-chancellor for Jamia Millia Islamia university, and the panel has chosen to extend the tenure of the incumbent, Mushirul Hasan.        
	Hasan is viewed by many in academic circles as a close aide of Arjun, who backed the Jamia VC when he was under fire last year for offering the universitys legal assistance to students suspected of terrorism.

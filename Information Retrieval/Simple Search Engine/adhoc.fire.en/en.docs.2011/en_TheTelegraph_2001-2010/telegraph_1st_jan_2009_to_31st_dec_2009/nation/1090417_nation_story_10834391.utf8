The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP leader steps up rallies
                                                                                                               BJP leader steps up rallies
          LALMOHAN PATNAIK                               
	Cuttack, April 16: Blame the anti-incumbency factor or the change in the BJD-BJP equation, but former BJP minister Samir Dey now finds himself on a sticky wicket in Cuttack (Barabati) as he gets ready to test the electoral waters.        
	The BJP heavyweight is now playing on the backfoot, trying to adapt himself to his home turf as he seeks a fourth consecutive term in the Assembly by trying to neutralise any anti-incumbency mood among electorate with emotive issues.        
	Dey, a popular man in the area, is undertaking a hectic campaign by highlighting on the issue of inadequate attention to Cuttack and is assuring people that he would safeguard the citys old glory. He has claimed to have led all major protests against government moves to shift state headquarter establishments and institutions to Bhubaneswar in the past 15 years.         
	The veteran leader had first won from the Cuttack in 1995 in a triangular fight with Congress and Janata Dal. He retained the seat for the next two terms, with BJD as his ally. All these years, the citys people have allowed me to serve them and their cause. I expect them to repose faith in me, Dey told The Telegraph today.         
	Besides, I have to finish several development projects in the city, he said, in the middle of a padyatra. Cuttack has been a BJP bastion with the party winning the last three Assembly elections here. But, this is the first time in 14 years that the BJP is contesting from the city all by itself, without the BJD as an ally.         
	Both the Congress and BJD leaders, it seems, are confident of wresting the seat from the BJP in a triangular fight. The former minister, however, hopes the mandate will go in his favour again         
	Voters have rejected the Congress candidate once and the BJD candidate has never been associated with Cuttack, Dey reasons. Congress candidate Suresh Mohapatra had lost elections from Cuttack in 2004, while BJD candidate Debashis Samantaray had won from Tirtol in Jagatsinghpur district in 2000, but had left the constituency after it was reserved for scheduled caste candidates.         
	In the recent Cuttack Municipal Corporation polls, the BJP had managed to bag one ward from 25 that constitute Barabati Cuttack. Dey, however, is optimistic. Assembly election is an altogether a different ballgame, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Build-up stirs Kargil fears 
                                                                                                               Build-up stirs Kargil fears 
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 16: A string of recent disclosures has raised suspicion in the security establishment that Pakistan may be quietly engaged in manoeuvres typical of the Kargil incursions.        
	These include tunnels across the Line of Control, new roads and bunkers along a large swathe of the western frontier and a plan to blast Jammus Baglihar dam.         
	This month, intelligence agencies found a tunnel, 90 metres on the Indian side, cutting across the Line of Control in Jammus Akhnoor region. Much of the tunnel had caved in during rain, but it seemed to belie official claims of a drop in infiltration in 2008-09.        
	That isnt the only tell-tale sign. A well-designed road network and bunkers along the border in Pakistan, from Gujarat and Rajasthan to Jammu and Kashmir, are said to have come up in the past six months in what security experts called a war-like planning.        
	The moves have come despite New Delhi building global pressure against Pakistans alleged terror network in the wake of the Mumbai attack.        
	Former envoy to Pakistan G. Parthasarathy said the plans couldnt have been executed without the Pakistan armys involvement. One shouldnt read too much but roads are an important adjunct to infiltration.         
	Last month, a Lashkar-e-Toiba militant arrested from Poonch revealed that a module of militants trained in Pakistans Punjab province had been tasked with blowing up Jammus Baglihar dam, intelligence sources said. He had also revealed that terrorist camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir were shifted after the Mumbai attack but remained active.        
	The Pakistanis have constructed over 50 bunkers in Jammu and in the Attari area of Punjab, near Amritsar. New roads have been laid along the border near Srinagar. These include the Chakoti-Muzaffarabad (20km) and the Khojabandi-Hajipir (6km) roads. Roads have also been made in the western sector, along the border in Gujarat and Rajasthan. These include the Kharki-Khara(100km) and the Bhaidesar-Nagarparkar (8km) links.        
	The flurry of activity has sparked fears that these may be related to possible incursions.         
	Security experts have warned against the tendency of denying danger signals. You cannot trust them. The denial mode the army was in that time (Kargil sneak-ins) should not happen now, said a senior intelligence officer who had served during the 1999 conflict.         
	Last month, the army is said to have noted the Lashkar didnt have the wherewithal to blow up the Baghliar dam.        
	Parthasarathy sounded a wake-up call: If we let another Kargil happen, we deserve it.

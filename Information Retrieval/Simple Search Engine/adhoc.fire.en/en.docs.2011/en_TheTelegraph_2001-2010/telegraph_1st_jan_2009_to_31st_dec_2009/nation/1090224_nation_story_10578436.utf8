The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ladies first and now tech dudes of south 
                                                                                                               Ladies first and now tech dudes of south 
          PRATIM D. GUPTA                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 23: Penelope Cruz spoke in Spanish. A.R. Rahman spoke in Tamil.         
	At Kodak Theatre, in front of the biggest and brightest names of Hollywood, Indias music maker signed off his best original score acceptance speech with ella pugazhum iraivanukkey (all glory to God).        
	While the entire nation rose to its feet, for people down south, the speech was that much sweeter. Sweeter still was the fact that two men from their part of the country  Tamil Rahman and Malayali Resul Pookutty  triumphed at the biggest movie night of the year, the Oscars.        
	For Bollywood, the south Indian film industries  making Tamil, Malayali, Telugu and Kannada movies  have historically been looked upon as the source for the leading ladies. Hema Malini to Rekha, Vyjayanthimala to Sridevi, actresses from down south have come and stolen the thunder in Hindi movies.         
	Now, the tables have turned slightly. While the actresses still make it big in Mumbai  Ghajini heroine Asin is billed as the next big thing  technicians have taken over, and how.         
	Rahman, of course, has been the torchbearer of Bollywood music right from his first original Hindi soundtrack in Rangeela (1995) and is not only the highest paid but also the most selling Hindi film music director.        
	Directors from the south have become stars in their own right. Unlike before, when a K. Balachander or an L.V. Prasad would not be talked about, a Mani Ratnam or a Priyadarshan calls the shots today.         
	Everyone from Anil Ambani to Shah Rukh Khan backs them to make commercial cinema in Bollywood. Aamir Khan agreed to do Ghajini with young south Indian director A.R. Murugadoss.        
	Then we have the cinematographers. Santosh Sivan (Dil Se, Fiza) and Ravi K. Chandran (Dil Chahta Hai, Black) have changed the way films look in Hindi cinema. Sreekar Prasad has edited some of the biggest films, among them Saathiya and Guru, while Anthony (Ghajini) is the new name to reckon with. With Resul setting new standards in sound, the south Indian invasion in the technical credits of Bollywood is complete.        
	We have been neglected in the north all along, said Ravi K. Chandran. They write about costume designers but not about cameramen or editors. Here in the south theres a lot of appreciation for us technicians and that is why the best are from here. Earlier, no one even knew the names of technicians. Guru Dutts cameraman V.K. Murthy was also from the south.        
	Sreekar Prasad said: Even now, editors are not really noticed and even the process or its importance in filmmaking is not known to many. Another reason is they are not part of the actual shooting, which is covered by the media.

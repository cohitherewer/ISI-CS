The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Slump cloud on Games stadium
                                                                                                               Slump cloud on Games stadium
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                           An image of the planned rugby stadium at Delhi University       
	New Delhi, March 9: The economic downturn and the upcoming elections are together threatening to delay a planned rugby stadium and key training facilities for athletics, boxing and wrestling for the 2010 Commonwealth Games.         
	The sports ministry has asked for a 37 per cent increase in funds for infrastructure for the Games at Delhi University, claiming that rising costs may otherwise block construction and renovation plans, The Telegraph has learnt.         
	The plans could be up and running soon despite the rising costs if the ministrys plea is accepted. But the proposal may be kept in abeyance till the Lok Sabha polls are over amid fears that approval of extra funds could attract the wrath of the Election Commission.         
	DU is a key venue for the Games that are scheduled to open on October 3, 2010. A new stadium  one of two new ones being constructed for the Games  is to come up at the university to host the Rugby 7s championship.        
	The university is also expected to provide indoor training facilities for athletics, boxing, netball, wrestling and rugby in a closed-roof arena. The rugby training facilities are to come up at top DU colleges  St Stephens, Hindu, Sri Ram College of Commerce, Kirorimal, Ramjas, Khalsa and Daulat Ram.         
	In March last year, the cabinet had approved Rs 222 crore for upgrade of existing facilities and the construction of new facilities at DU for the Games. The sports ministry has now circulated a cabinet note seeking an extra Rs 82 crore for the work at DU, citing rising input costs.         
	We are at a critical stage of our preparations for the Games. We desperately need the extra money... and fast, a sports ministry official said.         
	But sources in other ministries associated with the project and officials at the cabinet secretariat said it may not be easy to push through the proposal as the model code of conduct, which bars the government from taking decisions that could influence voters, had come into force.         
	Sports ministry sources said they drafted the cabinet note convinced that no decision concerning the Games would attract controversy.         
	That myth was shattered last week when the BJP complained against a newspaper ad, alleging that the government was trying to take credit for the Games, prompting the commission to issue a notice.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Shotgun to have the last laugh
                                                                                                               Shotgun to have the last laugh
          NALIN VERMA                          Shatrughan: Sanyas trump card                                  
	Patna, Jan. 28: His twin threats of taking political sanyas and joining the RJD has ensured actor-turned-politician Shatrughan Sinha a BJP ticket for the Patna Saheb Lok Sabha constituency.        
	Top party sources revealed that BJP president Rajnath Singh has assured Shotgun  as the actor is popularly known  of the ticket for the seat, which still has two contenders  Ravishankar Prasad and R.K. Sinha.        
	The actor yesterday said that he would take sanyas from politics, if the party refused him a ticket from his home constituency. Those lobbying for the actor argue that Prasad still had three-and-a-half years in the Rajya Sabha, while Sinha  who too belongs to Patna  is not the member of any House after the party refused to give him a third term in the Upper House last year.        
	Moreover, sources said that Shatrughan had been signalling to join Lalu Prasads RJD to contest the Patna Saheb seat, if the BJP denied him the ticket. Laluji could have readily accepted Shotgun as his partys nominee for Kayastha-dominated Patna Saheb, said an aide of Lalu Prasad.        
	BJP sources said that Rajnath pleaded to other leaders not to test Shatrughans patience much in the election year in which the party is set with the bigger goal to make L.K. Advani as the Prime Minister.        
	Supporters of R.K. Sinha, the chairman and owner of SIS, the largest security agency in India, are said to be still putting pressure on the leadership to give the veteran who has never been member either of the Rajya Sabha or the Lok Sabha his due. R.K. Sinha also enjoys the backing from the local RSS unit.         
	His aides feel that the tussle between Shotgun and Prasad for the ticket ahead of the BJP and JD(U) discussing the seat-sharing issue had tarnished the partys image and the party should consider R.K. Sinha who has silently served its cause.        
	But the BJP sources said that the party, conscious of its star-studded image, could ill afford to antagonise Shatrughan Sinha.

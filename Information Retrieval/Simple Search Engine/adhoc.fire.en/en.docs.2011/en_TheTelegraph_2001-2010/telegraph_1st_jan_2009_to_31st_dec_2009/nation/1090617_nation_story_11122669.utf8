          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 16: Mamata Banerjee has farmed out jobs to her two junior colleagues in the railway ministry, but kept vital operations and areas with herself.        
	The delegation of work, which follows reports that ministers of state E. Ahamed and K.H. Muniyappa didnt have much to do, has been done ahead of the rail budget to be presented on July 3.        
	The move is also being seen as a break from the tenure of Mamatas predecessor Lalu Prasad. Officials said he gave his junior ministers little work and almost no role in preparing the budget.        
	According to a railway ministry notification, the junior ministers will look after rail affairs in seven states each, besides having other responsibilities.        
	Ahamed has been assigned Bihar, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand, Assam and Jharkhand. Muniyappa will oversee matters related to Karnataka, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Himachal, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh.        
	Mamata has kept the rail affairs of home state Bengal with herself, along with those of Jammu and Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, said to be critical in terms of operations and projects.        
	Some in Rail Bhavan believe that Mamata has allocated work  and also kept Bengal with herself  so she can devote more time to her state ahead of the 2011 Assembly polls.        
	Muniyappa has been entrusted with safety and security, which Mamata has said needs to be improved. He will also oversee matters related to level crossings, construction of roads and bridges.        
	Complaints regarding goods traffic and cases related to pay commission will be under his charge, as will the purchase of engines, wagons and coaches if the expense does not exceed Rs 5 crore.        
	Ahamed will oversee punctuality, ticket checking, cleanliness and passenger complaints. He will also look into staff grievances.         
	Their roles have been specified in Parliament too. Ahamed will reply to questions and deal with resolutions and assurances in the Rajya Sabha. Muniyappa will do it in the Lok Sabha.

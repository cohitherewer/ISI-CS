          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                            Firemen wash mud off the walls of houses in Kurnool; (below) a bird covered in mud but alive				                                 
	Kurnool, Oct. 15: In the mornings, they are house owners. By afternoon, they are hanging about civic offices, fighting for food packets.        
	After sundown, jostling begins for space on railway platforms and at temples, cinemas, public halls and bus stands. They need to rest  there will be enough time the next morning to sit before their homes and cry.        
	The family of Sarojamma, 45, owns five houses in Kurnools Bapujinagar. The walls and roof are all they own now  the floods have washed away all furniture, the electrical wiring and belongings, even identity papers such as ration cards, voter I-cards and bank passbooks.        
	The houses arent empty, though. They are filled with debris and mud  not to speak of snakes and scorpions that the Tungabhadra and the Handri brought in during the deluge two weeks ago.        
	Sarojamma can at least stand her ground in the food-and-water queues but Marappa, 59, is too old. So he has joined the crowd of children, women and the aged at bus stands and railway stations, asking every visitor for food and water.        
	We are not beggars, but we dont have the strength to fight the queues, said the middle-class man who has to feed his four-year-old granddaughter. His daughter and son-in-law died in the floods.        
	The belongings from the homes of Sarojamma and Marappa are part of the huge dumps of garbage 2km off the highway.        
	These are huge mounds of mangled cars, motor bikes and scooters; electrical goods like computers; soiled and destroyed food grains, household utensils like gas cylinders, stoves and grinders  even school textbooks, said Govinda Rao, a municipal worker in the towns Poola Thota area.        
	The streets are covered in garbage and mud  a thick, slushy deposit of black soil. Men and children loiter forlorn. They have little to do: the schools and colleges are still closed although a few banks, shops and hotels have opened.        
	The hotels are full of TV crews. From now on, I will speak to them only if they pay me, said Krishnaiah, a schoolteacher who claims to have given dozens of interviews to national and international channels and newspapers in the past one week.        
	Near the city tower, the authorities are removing a high mound of slush with heavy equipment. We have poured two tanker-loads of water but the mound is still stiff, said Jayaprasad Rao, an official.        
	Some 1,000 civic staff and 500 volunteers from Hyderabad and the neighbouring districts are working to remove the debris and garbage, but the task ahead is colossal.        
	We need 80,000 trips by at least 300 tractors to remove the garbage from the roads and public places. Im not even thinking about the mud and garbage inside the houses, said T.G. Venkatesh, the local Congress MLA.        
	Sarojamma and Marappa have a long wait before they can go home.        
	Chief minister K. Rosaiah has promised free rations of 25kg rice, 2kg dal, edible oil and tea to every family till December. Well distribute it before Diwali and ensure everyone gets his share, he has said.

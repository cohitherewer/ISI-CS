          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 3: A man and his wife, both senior citizens, who were allegedly beaten up by their son and daughter-in-law, lodged a complaint with the Laxmisagar police today.        
	The couple, admitted to Capital Hospital with multiple injuries, have demanded that their son and his wife be arrested.         
	Trilochan and Khetramani Das were having dinner around 9pm last night when their eldest son, Pradumna, reached home. He asked me to bequeath my property to him. This was not the first time that he had asked for it and therefore I replied as I usually do. Soon his wife joined the verbal feud, said the emotional father today.         
	Pradumna then lifted a plank of wood lying nearby and hit his father again and again. I fell down and my wife who was crying for help, came running to stop him, said Das.        
	The son then hit his mother with the same plank.         
	His wife also joined him and kicked us both. They then pulled us through the room and threw us out, said Das.        
	Both Pradumna and his wife, Devyani, asked the senior couple to vacate the premises and locked the house.         
	Trilochan called for help till neighbours rushed the profusely bleeding couple to the hospital. Khetramani has received nine stitches on her head, while Das has received two, along with injuries on his head and back and was having trouble with breathing.         
	Doctors stressed that the couple was beaten with great force, with a blunt object.        
	We have received an FIR and the interrogation is on. Pradumna and his wife are absconding, said IIC Kishore Panigrahi.         
	While Pradumna is unemployed, his wife Devyani is employed as an assistant director at the secretariat. They stay at Bargarh Canal colony.        
	Das, a retired engineer, has three sons. Two of them reside outside Bhubaneswar. My eldest son and wife have been terrorising us and this time it crossed all limits. We demand justice, said Das.

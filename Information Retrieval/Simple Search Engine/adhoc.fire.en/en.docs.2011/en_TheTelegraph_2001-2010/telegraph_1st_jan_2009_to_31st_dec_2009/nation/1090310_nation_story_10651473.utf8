The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Private safe seat deal with Mulayam
                                                                                                               Private safe seat deal with Mulayam
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mulayam: Hotline?                                  
	New Delhi, March 9: As the talks stuttered over a seat deal, some Congress ministers charted their own course  a channel of communication with Mulayam Singh Yadav.        
	They reportedly cajoled and convinced the Samajwadi Party boss not to put up candidates against them and ensure that minority votes were not divided.        
	Samajwadi sources said that while Mulayam had all along been clear that irrespective of the outcome of the negotiations he would leave Rae Bareli and Amethi  Sonia and Rahul Gandhis constituencies  uncontested, he was not sure about other seats. Especially those old rivals like Salman Khurshid and Begum Noor Bano were eyeing.        
	When it was apparent that the talks were failing, central ministers Sriprakash Jaiswal and Jitin Prasada reportedly opened the line of communication with Mulayam. He agreed not to put up candidates in Kanpur and Dhaurahra.        
	While Jaiswal will fight for the second time from Kanpur, Prasada will contest from Dhaurahra.        
	Prasada had opted for Dhaurahra next door after his earlier constituency, Shahjahanpur, ceased to exist following the delimitation drive that redrew seat boundaries.        
	Congress sources said though the young MP began nursing the constituency from day one, he wasnt sure if caste equations would see him through.         
	Samajwadi sources said Mulayam looked at his own prospects when he decided not to name candidates in two other places, Mathura and Ghaziabad.        
	Although Congress insiders said he wanted to facilitate the victory of Manvendra Singh and Surendra Goel  sitting party MPs from these seats  a Samajwadi functionary claimed deeper political considerations were behind their leaders decision.        
	Rashtriya Lok Dal leader Ajit Singh has fielded his son Jayant from Mathura, and Mulayam, the Samajwadi source said, didnt want to spoil his chances for two reasons.        
	One, Ajit was a former ally and, after the polls, could cross over to a front of which the Samajwadi was a part. Two, Mulayam had been mentored by Jayants grandfather, the late Charan Singh. This is a token offering of a shishya to his guru, a source said.        
	In Ghaziabad, some Samajwadi leaders apparently prevailed on Mulayam not to weaken and destabilise BJP chief Rajnath Singh.

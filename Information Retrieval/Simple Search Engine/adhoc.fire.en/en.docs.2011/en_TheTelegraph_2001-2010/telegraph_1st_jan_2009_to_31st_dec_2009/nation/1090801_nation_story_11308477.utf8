The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Malegaon 11 off tough law
                                                                                                               Malegaon 11 off tough law
          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                               
	Mumbai, July 31: A special court today dropped charges under a tough crime control act against all the 11 accused in last years Malegaon blasts, including a sadhvi and a sacked army officer.        
	The ruling is a setback to the trial of sadhvi Pragya Singh, former Lieutenant Colonel Prasad Purohit  the first serving army officer to be booked in a terror case  and nine others, alleged to be part of a Hindu radical group fomenting terror.        
	Judge Y.B. Shinde said two basic conditions for booking the accused under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) had not been fulfilled: none was part of any organised crime syndicate and none had been chargesheeted in two separate cases the preceding 10 years.        
	They will now be tried under the IPC and the trial shifted from the special MCOCA court in Mumbai to a sessions court in Nashik, of which Malegaon is a part. Seven persons had died in the explosion on September 29 last year.        
	Theoretically, it should be easier for the group to get bail but Maharashtra police said they would appeal in Bombay High Court and secure a stay on the execution of todays order for four weeks. Both Naseem Khan, the state home minister, and anti-terror squad chief K.P. Raghuvanshi said they would appeal.        
	The ruling comes a week after Rakesh Dhawade, one of the 11 accused, was discharged by a court in Parbhani in a 2003 blast case for want of sufficient evidence.         
	The ATS had booked all the 11 on the ground that Dhawade, also accused in a 2004 Jalna blast, was charged twice. On this rested the polices 4,528-page chargesheet, filed against all the accused in the Malegaon blasts in January this year. With Dhawade discharged, the organised crime act does not hold against the others.

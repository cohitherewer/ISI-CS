	Ahmedabad, April 5: Gujarat will vote before the rest of India does so from April 16  in a BJP opinion poll to decide whether black money kept abroad should be brought back, reports our special correspondent.        
	The tax dodgers hidden cash is one of L.K. Advanis campaign themes, but the April 11 and 12 opinion poll is Narendra Modis brainchild. Gujarat votes on April 30. BJP Gujarat chief Purushottam Rupala, tasked with organising the polls, said: Our top leaders Advani and Modi are concerned about the black money in Swiss banks which they believe should be brought back and utilised.

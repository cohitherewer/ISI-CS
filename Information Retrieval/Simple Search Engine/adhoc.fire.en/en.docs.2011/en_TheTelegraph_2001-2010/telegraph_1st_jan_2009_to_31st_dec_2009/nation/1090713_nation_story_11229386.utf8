The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Citizens catch goons, cops pay lakhs
                                                                                                               Citizens catch goons, cops pay lakhs
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                          Police commissioner YS Dadwal (third from left) with brothers (left to right) Ranbir Singh Saini, Lakhvir Singh Saini and Harbir Singh Saini, who chased and caught gunmen who robbed their shop in Delhi                                  
	 When armed robbers enter a south Delhi bank, M.K. Kapoor, 75, a retired Delhi University professor, grabs one of them              
	 After gunmen rob their east Delhi mobile phone shop, three brothers chase them for kilometres and, despite being shot at, catch one              
	New Delhi, July 12: With just 6,000 personnel to protect the capital, Delhi police need all the help they can get. And suddenly they are getting it too, from unexpected quarters.        
	Police records say that in the first six months of this year, the force gave away Rs 29.14 lakh in reward to 323 Delhi residents for their bravery in fighting crime or for their initiative in tipping the police off about criminals.        
	In the whole of last year, the Delhi police had rewarded 137 people, which means this years rise has been almost five-fold.        
	Its a very heartening trend. We have always stressed the role the man in the street plays in fighting crime, police commissioner Y.S. Dadwal said.        
	We have got excellent tip-offs from people that have led to arrests. Citizens have even managed to catch criminals by showing excellent presence of mind. In all, we have solved 219 cases this year through their help.        
	The numbers dont tell the whole story, though.        
	Kapoor, 75, had risked his life by holding on to an armed robber at a Central Bank of India branch while all the others cowered. His example inspired four others to try to grab the remaining gang members, prompting them to flee. Kapoors man too wrenched himself free and fled, but the robbery was foiled. The professor and the four others were rewarded with Rs 25,000 each.        
	I did what I could to save lives. I knew if I let go of that goon, he would start firing, Kapoor said.        
	I didnt fear for my life: there was no time to think about it. I just did what came to my mind. Here I was, an old man trying to get some cash from the bank, when suddenly I came face to face with some heart-stopping action. I had to do something. I am grateful the police thought I helped them.        
	Lakhvir Singh Saini, one of the cellphone-shop brothers, said the idea of chasing armed dacoits on foot was frightening but he still did it.        
	I was scared, but that instant decision to pursue them was, in retrospect, something I dont regret, he said. The Saini brothers have received Rs 15,000 each and a commendation roll.        
	What would the police have done when they arrived? The robbers would have escaped by then, Lakhvir said.        
	We had worked very hard to get the business on its feet after my father died, and I was filled with rage at these men who looted the shop. I had to catch them, even if I were hit by a bullet. I believe all of us should help the police in whatever way we can to reduce crime in our city. Policemen cant be everywhere.        
	Both Kapoor and Lakhvir, however, said the police needed to have more beat constables and PCR vans on the roads.        
	Grappling with a soaring crime graph  257 robberies, 251 murders and 226 rapes already reported till June this year  the Delhi police chief realises the worth of the help from the likes of Kapoor and the Sainis.        
	I dont think these men and women who help us do it for the money, Dadwal said. What we give them is just a token  I am amazed they put their lives on the line to apprehend criminals. If people help the police in this manner, a lot of cases can be worked out.

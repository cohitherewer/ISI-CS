          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 4: The Centre today put on the table a proposal to allow marine police in coastal states longer stints so that the forces could specialise in the job.        
	The plan was discussed at the first national meeting dedicated to coastal security. The home secretaries of nine coastal states participated. Cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar chaired the discussions.        
	Over the past few weeks, the pace of work on marine policing  under the glare since last Novembers Mumbai attack  has picked up in states, said home ministry sources. The exceptions, they said, are Bengal, Orissa and Kerala, which have been slow despite central assistance. Tamil Nadu, they pointed out, has made good progress.        
	Todays discussions explored the possibility of letting state police officers remain in the marine wings for substantially long periods to help them specialise. At present, officers are sent to the marine wings, which often lack basic facilities, for only a couple of months.         
	The aim is to create well-trained marine officers who can secure the shallow waters close to coasts. A 12-nautical mile area along the coast is considered shallow waters.         
	One problem in the plan is that the coast guard, which patrols the high seas, has apparently said it is too burdened to patrol the 12-nautical mile zone. State police also say they dont have the manpower and facilities to oversee the stretch. But home ministry officials feel the coast guard  under the defence ministry  needs to be flexible, while the states need to pull up their socks.

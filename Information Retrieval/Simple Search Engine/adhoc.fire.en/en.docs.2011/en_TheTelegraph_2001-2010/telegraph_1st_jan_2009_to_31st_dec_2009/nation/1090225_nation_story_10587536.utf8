The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Multi-phase poll on cards

	New Delhi, Feb. 24: The Lok Sabha election is likely to be held over five or six phases as fewer paramilitary personnel would be available for poll duty, sources said today.        
	A home ministry team met the election commissioners and asked them to stagger the exercise, saying central security personnel would continue to be posted in troubled and militancy-hit areas during the polls.        
	This would mean a substantial cut in the number that will be released for election duty. The sources said the change of course in the home ministry had been spurred by the Mumbai terror strikes.        
	A multi-phase election will, however, not be to the liking of political parties. Most of them had urged the Election Commission to make the process as short as possible after considering board exams and national and state holidays.        
	In a meeting on February 3, the parties had suggested that voting be held in a single phase in states where one-day polls had earlier been held.         
	Most were, however, unanimous that the presence of central security personnel was vital to ensure free and fair polling.        
	What the Election Commission chooses to do will be known on March 1 or by this weekend as the schedule is likely to be announced by then, the sources said.        
	In that case, the elections should begin in the first week of May, well in time for a new government to be formed by the end of that month.        
	This morning, Madhukar Gupta, the home secretary, and Raman Shrivastava, the special secretary (internal security), held talks with the election commissioners for over 30 minutes.        
	They apprised the trio of the exact number of paramilitary personnel the Centre would be able to spare, the sources said.         
	Compared with 750 companies  each company has 120 soldiers  deployed in the 2004 elections, a maximum of only 550 companies would be available this time.        
	The sources said CRPF and BSF personnel would comprise the bulk of the forces to be posted on poll duty. In border areas, Assam Rifles, Sashastra Seema Bal and Indo-Tibetan Border Police personnel would be deployed, with army back-up if required.        
	Although states have their own security reserves, including home guards and the state reserve police force, central personnel are seen as a must for a free, fair and peaceful election.        
	The recent seven- phase Jammu and Kashmir elections were lauded as the most successful election in the state.

                                                                                                               NSG command tiff
          SUJAN DUTTA                               
	New Delhi, March 19: A turf war has broken out between South Block and North Block with the army demanding that the command of the National Security Guard be handed over to it since it staffs the NSGs action group and deputes its officers and troops to the elite force.         
	A likely compromise in the tiff between the defence ministry in South Block and the home ministry in North Block is a splitting of the NSG into two with the creation of an NSG Rangers for internal security commando operations  such as during 26/11  and a Special Protection Group for VIP duties, a high-level planner has suggested.         
	The defence ministry is understood to have forwarded a recommendation from the chief of army staff, General Deepak Kapoor, to the cabinet secretary and the home ministry, that a lieutenant general take command of the NSG.         
	But that was before N.P.S Aulakh, the former Punjab director-general of police, was named the NSGs director-general after J.K. Dutta retired last month.         
	Yes, there are some issues that have come up. We hope they will be settled amicably, General Kapoor admitted on the sidelines of a ceremony this afternoon.        
	Nearly all the NSG troops who were in action in 26/11 in Mumbai were from the Special Action Group that is made up of deputees from the army. The officer killed, Sandeep Unnikrishnan, was a major in the army.         
	The issue has come up now because the army has a shortage of officers but it is expected to depute more officers to the NSG as the group is being expanded.        
	The army chief said that till such time as the NSG can get its own centres in the four metros, the armys special forces are deploying their units there.         
	General Kapoor gave his recommendation shortly before the new director-general for the NSG was named. The logic, an army officer explained, is simple: the personnel is from the army, the ethos is from the army, the training is the armys and therefore the command should be the armys, and not the polices.         
	Army headquarters has pointed out that it is trying hard to find good officers. It is hoping that the economic recession will work in its favour because candidates who would otherwise have gone in for lucrative corporate sector jobs will now find the army a better career option.

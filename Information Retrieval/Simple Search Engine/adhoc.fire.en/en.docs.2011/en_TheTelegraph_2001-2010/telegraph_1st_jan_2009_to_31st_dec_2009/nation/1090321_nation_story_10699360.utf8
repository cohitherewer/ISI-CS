The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Former ally slams communal BJP
                                                                                                               Former ally slams communal BJP
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              Naveen Patnaik: Breaking his silence?
      
	Bhubaneswar, March 20: A fortnight after the split in the BJD-BJP alliance, the BJD today blamed its former coalition partner for the last years clashes in Kandhamal and alleged that the alliance did not last because of the saffron partys hidden agenda.         
	The BJD backed out of the 11-year alliance as the BJP was out to implement its secret communal agenda, said party secretary-general and chief spokesperson Damodar Rout today.         
	Rout said the BJD-BJP alliance was formed on January 20, 1998, on the basis of a common minimum programme to bring peace and prosperity to the state. However, instead of carrying out the common minimum programme, the BJP conspired to implement a hidden agenda, he alleged.         
	Interestingly, the leader admitted that the BJD had forged the alliance, knowing its communal character.         
	We had done so (alliance), keeping in mind the larger interest of the people, to liberate people from the Congress government, he explained.         
	Rout further alleged that though the BJP was given 63 Assembly and nine Lok Sabha seats, it conspired to expand its base in other constituencies at the cost of BJD.         
	BJP leaders tried to sow seeds of communal hatred in Kandhamal, Gajapati, Sundergarh and Mayurbhanj to carry out their hidden communal agenda to expand their organisational base.         
	They conspired with the VHP, the RSS and the Bajrang Dal to create a Gujarat-like situation in the hitherto peaceful Orissa.         
	This resulted in last years riots, said the BJD secretary general, claiming that his observation was revealed from police investigations.         
	The leader went on to applaud chief minister Naveen Patnaik, who he called was a strict believer in secularism, and who had initiated stern legal action, including the arrest of 5,000 rioters.         
	Denying the allegation, BJP legislature party leaders and former industries minister in the government, Biswabhusan Harichandan said: It took 11 years for the BJD to discover that ours is a communal party which is travesty of truth. We dont have any hidden agenda, rather the BJD has one, alleged Harichandan.

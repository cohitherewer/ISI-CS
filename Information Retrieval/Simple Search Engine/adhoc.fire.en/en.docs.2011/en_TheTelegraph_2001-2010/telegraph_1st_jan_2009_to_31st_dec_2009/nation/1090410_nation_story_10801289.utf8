The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Genial CM drives home his point
                                                                                                               Genial CM drives home his point
          NALIN VERMA                          Nitish Kumar gets ready for his meal. Picture by Deepak Kumar                                  
	Patna, April 9: Half an hour after the chopper takes off, Nitish Kumar, dressed in his trademark white kurta-pyjama, opens a tiffin box, closely inspects his fellow travellers hands (asking some to clip their nails) and offers them tissues to clean them.        
	Then he offers his motley crew comprising staff and journalists roti and dry potato curry wrapped in fresh paper napkins. Finally, he brings out a water bottle and glasses, murmuring: One should always maintain cleanliness while eating, to avoid infection.         
	The Bihar chief minister seems to be a stickler for cleanliness and routine, a habit that he does not abandon even while addressing a crowd at Maharajganj  a north Bihar Lok Sabha constituency. He speaks with a smile and cuts out the political rhetoric, emotional frills and innuendoes from his speech. In the process, Nitish Kumar emerges as a smiling assassin for opponents.         
	One of them, Rabri Devi is under the Election Commission scanner for using derogatory words against Nitish. So is Lalu Prasad for his roller speech regarding Varun Gandhi. BJPs Sushma Swaraj described Lalu as jallad (butcher), which she later denied. Lalu retorted by referring to Sushma as Putna  a mythical demonic character.         
	Addressing a gathering and braving the sun at Hisuapur Bazaar in Maharajganj of Siwan, Nitish said: Some people are abusing me, despite the fact that I am the chief minister. Imagine how well they will behave with you.         
	In Siwan, the stronghold of RJD don Md Shahabuddin, Nitish added: It was difficult for you to venture out of your homes after sunset. Now, you stay in a peaceful town. I am not here to mesmerise you. I am here to ask for my pay. If you feel that you have got roads, medical facilities and a sorted out law and order system that you had asked for, vote for my partys nominees. Or, you will end up getting the previous order.         
	Apne nishchint rahin, vote rauye ke diyayee (Be sure that we will vote only for you, a man from the crowd shouts, making the chief ministers smile wider.         
	Referring to the hateful words used during campaigns, an expert in behavioural science, A.K. Tiwary, said: Abusive words are a reflection of frustration. One has the tendency to become abusive when they are weak.         
	Nitish, while interacting with media persons in the chopper, said: It is a battle between kaam karne waale (performers) and baat banane waale (demagogues).

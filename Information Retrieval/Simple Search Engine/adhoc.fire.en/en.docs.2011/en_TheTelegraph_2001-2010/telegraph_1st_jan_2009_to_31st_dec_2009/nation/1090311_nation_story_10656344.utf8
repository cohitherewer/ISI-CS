The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Health test for MPs, with eighteen questions
                                                                                                               Health test for MPs, with eighteen questions
          G.S. MUDUR                                             
	New Delhi, March 10: Kavita Silarapu, living with the HIV virus for five years, has 18 questions for Lagadapati Rajagopal, Congress member of Parliament from Vijayawada, her hometown.        
	Shell accept only Yes or No for answers.        
	In Delhi, Hari Kumar, HIV positive for 15 years, hopes to meet Congress MP Sandeep Dixit with the same questions.        
	In Ahmedabad, Jagruti Patel is trying to find the MP who will face the quiz from her.         
	In the first nationwide effort to grade constituency-level political commitment to health, several hundred volunteers will ask their MPs how  if at all  they have contributed to improving tuberculosis control in areas from where they were elected.         
	Political commitment can make a big difference to the quality of TB diagnosis and treatment efforts. But right now we know next to nothing about how much political commitment each of our elected MPs has shown over the past five years, said Bobby John, director of Global Health Advocates, a non-government agency co-ordinating the project funded partially by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.        
	Over the next six weeks, volunteers from the Indian Network of People Living with HIV will individually approach more than 500 MPs in their constituencies and ask questions, crafted to elicit Yes or No responses.        
	People living with HIV are the most vulnerable among us to TB bacilli. Now, theyll produce Indias first report card on political commitment to TB, John said.        
	Conventional measures of political will in health have been budget allocations and programme sizes.         
	Indias 12-year-old Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP) has improved diagnostic facilities and drug supply for patients. Diagnosis is available at 12,500 centres now, against 3,000 five years ago, and every patient enrolled for treatment is guaranteed drugs for six months to a year.        
	Progress has been remarkable... but if infrastructure is really as good as it should be, why do we still have 1,000 people dying from TB each day  its almost the same as it was five years ago, John said.        
	Medical experts believe greater constituency-level political involvement in TB control can push health administrators into improving services and infrastructure and motivate more people to seek treatment early and complete it.        
	We elected them. We now want to know whether they helped us against TB, said Elango Ramachandar, a project co-ordinator from Chennai. Were also hoping that this will sensitise MPs, so that they ask more questions in Parliament.         
	The answers from the MPs will be correlated with district-level statistics of the TB control programme, allowing their claims to be compared with actual performance.         
	Despite the successes of the RNTCP, doctors have warned that thousands of patients across the country continue to be wrongly managed every year because of inadequate diagnostic facilities or faulty treatment.         
	Some volunteers say they were motivated to join the project by personal tragedies.         
	We need better diagnosis for extra-pulmonary TB (TB of tissues outside the lungs), said Kavita from Vijayawada, who lost both her parents to the disease. The labs kept saying the chest and sputum were clear, but my father died from TB meningitis, and my mother died with an enlarged heart.         
	Kumar, the volunteer from east Delhi who hopes to quiz Congress MP Dixit, recalls how a doctor in a government hospital encouraged him to take anti-TB drugs for three years, instead of the standard six months.         
	That was 10 years ago, Kumar said. But even today, we do not have enough facilities to select the most suitable combination of drugs to treat the disease in each patient.        
	John said the report card would be ready by the time the 15th Lok Sabha was constituted. Health bureaucrats or technocrats were so far accountable for health issues. We are now trying to bring political accountability in health, he added.

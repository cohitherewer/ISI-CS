          OUR BUREAU                          Amar: Rift with Congress?                                  
	New Delhi/Lucknow, Jan. 10: The Congress-Samajwadi Party alliance appears shaky after Mulayam Singh Yadav and Amar Singh unilaterally announced Samajwadi candidates for 46 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh.         
	The names were released in two sets: 29 on Thursday and 17 today. In between, neither side attempted to reach out to the other.         
	Unless Congress president Sonia Gandhi quickly intervenes, sources in both parties said, the alliance could unravel even before it has properly firmed up.        
	The Congress is unhappy with the Samajwadis for naming candidates for seats it wants  Rampur, Amroha, Salempur, Muzaffarnagar and Jalaun. Amar, at news conferences he addressed this week, accused the Congress of being predatory and poaching on his party MPs and MLAs.        
	After spiriting away seven former Samajwadi MLAs in Madhya Pradesh just before the Assembly polls, the Congress admitted to re-inducting S. Bangarappa, the Samajwadi MP from Karnataka, and giving him a Lok Sabha ticket from Shimoga after the district unit unanimously voted in his favour. Bangarappa was a former Congress leader and Karnataka chief minister but had left to join the Samajwadis.        
	Another Samajwadi MP, Saleem Sherwani, who was denied a ticket from his constituency Badayun in Uttar Pradesh, formally sought re-admission into the Congress. Sherwani was a friend of Rajiv Gandhi and had won a Lok Sabha election on a Congress ticket but had left after the Babri demolition.         
	I am definitely fighting from Badayun. I fought six times and won five times. I owe everything I am to the people of Badayun, he said when spotted today at the Congress headquarters.        
	Sonia has summoned the state Congress president, Rita Bahuguna Joshi, to the capital. Joshi and the general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh, Digvijay Singh, are expected to meet the Congress president tomorrow. I was kept in the dark (by the Samajwadis), Joshi said.        
	Digvijay added: We are all political people, batting for our own team. We want the best bargain. One shouldnt grudge them (Samajwadis) for what they are doing.        
	The Congress and the Samajwadis have had only two meetings on seat-sharing since July when they came together.         
	Amar said if the Supreme Court or the Election Commission struck down Sanjay Dutts candidature from Lucknow, he would field the actors wife Maanyata. Dutt was convicted in the Bombay blasts and is out on bail.

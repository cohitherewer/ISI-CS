The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Miffed Raje mum on date of resignation 
                                                                                                               Miffed Raje mum on date of resignation 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jaipur, Aug. 27: The turmoil in the BJP looks set to continue with Vasundhara Raje today making it plain that she was miffed at the way she was being treated by the party bosses in Delhi and gave no indication whatsoever on when she would step down as leader of Opposition in Rajasthan.         
	Speaking to reporters here, Raje wondered why the central leaders were making a fuss about her resignation everyday since they had left the decision to her. The former chief minister said she would abide by the party decision, but kept mum on when she would do so.        
	Instead, Raje chose to lead a vociferous group of about 60 BJP legislators outside the Vidhan Sabha to protest against the suspension of three of their colleagues for unruly behaviour, a signal to the high command that she still reigns over the state unit and enjoys popularity as their leader.         
	Even her arch rivals and contenders for the post of legislature party chief, Ghanshyam Tiwari and Gulab Chand Kataria, stood with her.        
	Raje, while spelling out her achievements, said she had worked for Rajasthan for the past five years and would continue to do so for its welfare and would like to stay on in Jaipur.         
	Listing her accomplishments, Raje said she brought the state out of the BIMARU group, improved its finances and general health and yet she had been accused of corruption and amassing wealth.        
	Asked by The Telegraph why then was the high command ignoring her achievements, Raje said: I have done my work. It is for them to see the work now and decide. I know the people want me, they love me. I have been getting hundreds of calls everyday, wanting me to continue and I have always remained committed and dedicated towards the state. It is as if the fight has just begun.        
	Raje gave a beguiling smile when asked if the state BJP unit was heading for a vertical split. Thats the next episode. Just wait and watch, she said.        
	Rajendra Rathore, a loyalist of the former chief minister, also confirmed theres no decision about Rajes resignation or when she will put in her papers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP targets Lalu to defend Varun 
                                                                                                               BJP targets Lalu to defend Varun 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 7: The BJP today pounced on Lalu Prasads remark on Varun Gandhi, using it as a weapon against the rail minister and a shield for its Pilibhit candidate who is in jail for allegedly endangering communal harmony.        
	In an argument that could apply to both Varun and Lalu Prasad, it said candidates did cross the limit in the heat of campaigning but the poll panel had restricted its ire to the BJP.        
	At a rally in Bihars Kishanganj yesterday, Lalu Prasad had said: The day Varun Gandhi used his tongue against the 17 crore Muslims of the country, I would have run a roller over his chest irrespective of consequences had I been the home minister.        
	The BJP swiftly petitioned the poll panel to take action against him, even urging the Prime Minister to sack him.        
	But Lalu Prasad clarified his remark at a Jharkhand rally today. What I meant was crushing him under the roller of law had I been the home minister, he said.        
	The BJP trained its guns on the Election Commission. The EC crossed its jurisdiction by suggesting to us to change Varun as candidate. We believe that was a wrong precedent. But will the EC direct the RJD not to field Lalu Prasad as a candidate?        
	Party spokesperson Balbir Punj said the civil society should either seek Varuns release or press for application of the National Security Act against Lalu Prasad too.         
	In Varanasi, Union HRD minister Arjun Singh denounced Lalu Prasads words. Only Lalu can speak like this. What else can he speak, only such statements are expected of him.

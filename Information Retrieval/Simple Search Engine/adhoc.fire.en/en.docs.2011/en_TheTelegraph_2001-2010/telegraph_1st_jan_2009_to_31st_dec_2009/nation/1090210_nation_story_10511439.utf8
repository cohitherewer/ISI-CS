The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Shuffle in BJP poll war room
                                                                                                               Shuffle in BJP poll war room
  - Shift from Advani only   to collective leadership        SANJAY K. JHA                          Arun Jaitley at the BJP national council in Nagpur on Sunday. (PTI)                                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 9: The BJP has moved away from its Advani alone stand and begun projecting its collective leadership.        
	At the Nagpur national council that ended yesterday, L.K. Advani himself marked the shift in election strategy by focusing on the team he has built in his five-decade-old political career.        
	The shadow Prime Minister discarded his written speech, telling the media to consider it read, and went on to highlight the strength of the BJPs second-rung leaders.        
	He named Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley, Venkaiah Naidu, Narendra Modi, Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Raman Singh individually and extolled their exceptional understanding and skills.        
	The shift was apparently triggered yesterday when Modi addressed his leaders perceived age handicap by stressing that Advanis team was younger than Sonia Gandhis.         
	Senior leaders too had been worried that the exclusive focus on Advanis leadership wasnt helping the party and that something different was needed to rev up the campaign, sources said.        
	Besides, Advani lacks Atal Bihari Vajpayees charisma which had widened the BJPs appeal, allowing the party to centre its poll campaigns around him with slogans such as Abki baari (its now the turn of) Atal Bihari.        
	Therefore, at Nagpur home turf of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh which abhors the personality cult  Advani himself spoke of the BJPs chief ministers and other second-rung leaders. This was widely appreciated by delegates and became the talking point.        
	Party president Rajnath Singh, who had stirred up the conclave with his loud temple talk, also received Advanis endorsement with the shadow Prime Minister saying the BJP could not abandon Ram.        
	Advanis praise of all the next-generation leaders instead of just one chief minister too will gladden Rajnath who would not want Modi to emerge as an unchallenged power centre.        
	A move to decentralise the election management mechanism was further evidence that Advani was trying to be even-handed with his lieutenants.        
	Jaitley, who is not contesting the polls, wanted overall charge of the elections but Advani distributed the work.        
	While Jaitley has been given charge of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Delhi, Sushma  who is a candidate herself  will look after Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand.         
	Jaitley, however, will continue to handle the media.        
	Venkaiah, who wanted to oversee the elections from Delhi instead of contesting, too has been cut to size although Advani lauded his organisational skills at the conference.         
	He has been asked to take care of the south, which in effect means only Karnataka. Ananth Kumar, who was running the war room from Delhi, has been restricted to Karnataka, his home state.

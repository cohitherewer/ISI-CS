          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 3: The Orissa Blind Association today appealed to the government to fill up the backlog of vacancies for employment of the visually handicapped.         
	Not a single blind person has been absorbed in the state secretariat, directorates, district collectorates, high court or any other courts, rued the association members.        
	While there is 3 per cent reservation in jobs for the disabled in government sectors, one per cent employment is earmarked for the visually challenged. Health and some other departments still have large number of vacancies but they do not even seem interested in filling up the backlog of vacancies reserved for the visually challenged, said association general secretary Sanyas Behera.         
	We demand BPL rice for the unemployed, land pattas, Indira Awas houses and jobs for the blind, he added.

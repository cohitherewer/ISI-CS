	New Delhi, May 25 (PTI): The Supreme Court today asked the Uttar Pradesh government to issue provisional appointments to 22,000 constables sacked in 2007.        
	The Mayavati government had alleged that the constables had been illegally appointed during Mulayam Singh Yadavs term. The court rapped the government for dragging its feet in the case.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Never so bad Never so good 
                                                                                                                 Never so bad 
  Never so good
          As Bengal gets set for its poll kickoff on April 30, Ashis Chakrabarti gives an overview                                           
	Until two years ago, he was the poster boy of Indias reforms brigade. Some said he was a more daring reformer than even the first reformer Manmohan Singh because here was Indias first communist-turned-capitalist reformer.         
	Corporate czars, the media and the new middle class elite agreed they had finally found in him Indias very own Deng Xiaoping.         
	No one knows better than Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee how things have changed for him  and for Bengal  in two dramatic years. As he criss-crosses the state on yet another election campaign, he knows he has the toughest battle of his political career on hand. He probably agrees that he would lose much this time. The question is how much.         
	And the big irony is that the challenge he faces this time is largely of his own making. It isnt so much the coming together of the Congress and the Trinamul Congress that is his biggest challenge.         
	The two parties came together to fight the Left in Bengal in the 2001 Assembly elections but fared no better than what the united Congress did before Mamata Banerjee walked away from it in 1998.         
	Bhattacharjees problems have more to do with a fundamental change in Bengals politics. For the first time in Bengal, the Left, especially the CPM, is projected as the enemy of the rural poor. The Leftists rode to power on their long and hard struggles for land to the poor and ruled Bengal for more than three decades mainly by virtue of their land reforms.         
	Singur and Nandigram, bloodied icons in Bhattacharjees failed industrialisation campaigns, put his government in the dock for trying to take away land from the farmers in order to hand it to over to industrialists. Not everyone agrees it was all his fault; Mamata Banerjee raised hell to stop the chief ministers industrialisation drive.         
	People have been killed in police firing several times during the Lefts long reign in Bengal. Political violence has long co-existed in the state with the love of Rabindrasangeet. But the police firing in Nandigram on March 14, 2007, was a cataclysmic mix of political violence and state terror. That it occurred over a question of land turned things upside down for the ruling Marxists. As Mamata gained from the new scenario, Bhattacharjees problems were compounded by open attacks on him by the CPMs allies in the Left Front and even anger within the party.                   
	It was never so bad for Bhattacharjee and never so good for Mamata. Many of her earlier hopes for change were built on thin air or hugely hyped. This time it looks more real than ever before.         
	Her campaigns in Singur and Nandigram worked political wonders for her. All her earlier acts of brazen opportunism and senseless violence were forgotten and forgiven. Here was Bengals new messiah who would save farmers land from the rapacious Marxists-turned-capitalist roaders.         
	The making of Mamatas new image got a huge boost from big names in Bengals arts and letters, many of them earlier known for their Leftist political sympathies, joining her campaigns over Singur and Nandigram. Many of them would have considered it infra dig to be seen supporting a political maverick like Mamata. The mahamichhil in Calcutta in November 2007 in the aftermath of the police firing in Nandigram eloquently captured the mood of anger at the Left.         
	Much more damaging than the cries of intellectuals was the political campaign that Muslims would be the worst victims of the governments land-for-industry drive. The Rizwanur Rahman case, although not strictly political, upset the Muslims as did the Sachar Committees conclusion that the Muslims in Bengal got an unfair deal from the Lefts 32-year rule.         
	The panchayat elections last year proved that the campaign worked against the Left. The outcome of the Lok Sabha polls in Bengal, where Muslims constitute 26 per cent of the voters, could largely depend on the extent of the erosion in the Lefts Muslim votebank.         
	Here too Mamata has an advantage that she didnt have in the Lok Sabha polls of 2004 and the Assembly elections of 2006, when she had the BJP as her ally. By leaving the BJPs company and having the Congress as an ally this time she is theoretically better placed to secure more Muslim votes than before.         
	Against all these odds, the Left has two big hopes: that enough people, especially the youth, still have their faith in Bhattacharjees promise of a new, industrialised Bengal and that the threat of Darjeeling being separated from Bengal would stir Bengalis to rise against another Partition. The promise of a third front coming to power in New Delhi is only a minor story in the campaign, although the Lefts ability to call the shots at the Centre depends on how it does in Bengal and Kerala.         
	The ultimate hope for Bhattacharjee, however, lies in the organisational might of his party. Nandigram, Lalgarh and several other areas have witnessed the CPMs retreat and the growing Maoist threat to the partys leaders and support bases. There are other signs of the party organisation losing steam. Yet, the party organisation, still a formidable one, remains Bhattacharjees best bet.               
	 Bengal votes on April 30 and May 7 and 13

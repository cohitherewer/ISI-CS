The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong ready to dump JMM
                                                                                                               Cong ready to dump JMM
          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 14: The Congress appears set to break its alliance with the JMM, convinced that the party would be more of a liability in the coming Assembly elections in Jharkhand.        
	Congress central observers who toured the state last week have conveyed to party chief Sonia Gandhi the overwhelming desire of party workers to sever ties with the JMM.        
	Over 99 per cent of workers and leaders are opposed to the JMM. We have conveyed this to the party president and a final decision will be taken after studying all the aspects of the difficult political situation in Jharkhand, a member of the central team said.         
	The team, headed by AICC general secretary Mukul Wasnik, has not submitted any written report to the party president yet .         
	The observers were disturbed by the state of the organisation in Jharkhand, but the overriding feeling was that there may not be enough time before the polls to choose a new state chief.

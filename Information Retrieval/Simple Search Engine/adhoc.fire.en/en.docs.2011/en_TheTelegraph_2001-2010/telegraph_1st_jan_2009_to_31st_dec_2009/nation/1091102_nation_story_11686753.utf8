                                                                                                               Court indicts VC for contempt
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, Nov. 1: An order of the Patna High Court has held Magadh University vice-chancellor B.N. Pandey guilty of filing a false affidavit and thereby committing contempt of court.        
	A case of moral turpitude and criminal tresspass was filed against Pandey in the Motihari Town police station under IPC Sections 448, 354 and 290 when Pandey was the principal of a local college. However, the case could not deter the authorities from promoting him as the vice-chancellor of Magadh University.        
	Recently, another criminal case was filed by the education department deputy director in the Magadh University police station under IPC Sections 420, 467, 471, 472, 504, 506, 353 and Section 13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act against Pandey for allegedly committing fraud, making illegal appointments, preventing government auditor from discharging his duties and indulging in other corrupt practices. The case is being investigated.        
	If the criminal charges were not enough, the high court found the VC guilty of making a false affidavit feigning illness and thereby committing contempt of court.         
	As per the high court case, he was directed to be physically present in the court on September 3, 2008, in connection with case no. 6509. However, an application for exemption from personal appearance was filed in the court by the VC, as he was apparently ill.         
	Subsequently it came to light that the VC was only feigning illness to avoid court appearance and he, in fact, participated in a public function held in Gaya College when he was supposedly ill. The entire function, which was followed by a sumptuous lunch, was well documented by the electronic media.         
	Subsequently, Pandeys counsel Ahsan Amanuulah withdrew from the case. Amanullah also wrote a hard-hitting letter  a copy of which is with The Telegraph  taking the VC to task for breach of faith and making the counsel seek exemption on ground of illness, which was found to be untrue.         
	Holding the VC guilty, the high court referred the matter to the governor-cum-chancellor for taking appropriate action against him. As of now, Governor Devanand Konwar is out of Patna and he was scheduled to return on November 4.         
	According to Nageshwar Sharma, former director of higher education, the continuance of VC had become untenable in view of the high court finding him (VC) guilty of filing a false affidavit and thereby misleading the court.         
	The VC should immediately resign in view of the court indictment, he said, adding that in case the VC did not quit on his own, the chancellor should withdraw his pleasure.         
	Following the high court order, the Magadh University Postgraduate Teachers Association has demanded immediate dismissal of Pandey.

  - OCA action against senior Ranji player          OUR CORRESPONDENT      
	Cuttack, Aug. 31: The Orissa Cricket Association (OCA) introduced a fresh code of conduct, banning use of tobacco in the form of cigarette, paan and gutka by players during practice sessions and matches.        
	It also prohibited consumption of alcohol by players during practice sessions and matches from today.        
	The new code also disallowed use of mobile phones in the dressing room during practice sessions and matches. A set of seven new guidelines had been brought into force under the amended guidelines of the OCAs code of conduct. The new guidelines had become imperative to ensure discipline among the players, said Asirbad Behera, the OCA secretary.        
	OCA sources said the amendments proposed by the selection committee were endorsed by the tournament and disciplinary committee yesterday soon after recommending a one-year ban on senior Ranji Trophy player Sanjay Satpathy from September 1.         
	Satpathy was also issued a showcause notice returnable by September 15. If he fails to furnish the reply within the stipulated time, the ban will be extended for life, the notice has warned. The disciplinary action has been initiated against him for passing disparaging remarks on team selection to the media, the OCA secretary said.        
	Satpathy, dropped from the Ranji team last season after playing 63 matches and claiming 208 wickets, had criticised the OCAs selection process in a section of the vernacular media last week         
	The code of conduct further empowered only the captain and coach to communicate with the media. The sources said the players, however, could talk to the media by taking permission from the OCA on special circumstances.         
	The new set of guidelines also made it mandatory for players to use caps and helmets with the OCA logo both during practice sessions and matches.        
	The OCA had further decided to introduce gradation system among players on the basis of performance. We hope to infuse competitive spirit among the players through the gradation system, Behera said.

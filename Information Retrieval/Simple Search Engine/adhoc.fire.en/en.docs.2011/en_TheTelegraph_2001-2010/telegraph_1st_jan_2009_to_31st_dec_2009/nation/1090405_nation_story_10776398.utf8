The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Omar dares BJP on 370
                                                                                                               Omar dares BJP on 370
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Omar: Speaking up                                  
	Srinagar, April 4: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah today dared the BJP or any other government at the Centre to scrap Article 370, saying no party had the power to deprive the state of its special status.        
	No central government has the power to repeal the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, Omar said after a meeting with alliance partner Congress over sharing seats for the coming polls.         
	Truth is that even if the BJP ever gets two-third majority in Parliament to form the government, it cant abrogate Article 370, the National Conference leader added.        
	The BJP, which released its poll manifesto yesterday, promised to repeal the act and fully integrate the state with the country.        
	Jammu and Kashmir enjoys special status under the article that, among other things, bars non-state subjects from buying immovable property in the state or voting in Assembly elections.        
	The BJP has a habit of misleading people on false pretexts to garner votes. Unfortunately, the BJP says something in closed rooms and something in its manifesto. If you meet a senior leader of the BJP privately, he would tell you that they cannot do it (revoke the act). But they raise this issue for public consumption, Omar said.        
	Omars party had to pay a heavy price for not pursuing autonomy with the BJP government in the late nineties even after the Assembly had passed a resolution in its favour.         
	The NC lost power in the 2002 elections, one major reason being that his father Farooq Abdullah preferred power over autonomy.        
	The party is now trying hard to convince residents that it is committed to autonomy and will not allow any party to dilute Kashmirs special status. Omar said his party was trying to create an atmosphere in which people could vote without fear.        
	We have had several meetings in which we discussed infiltration, election, Amarnath yatra and tourism. We want to create a conducive atmosphere  as it was during the Assembly polls  so that people can vote freely and without fear, he said.        
	Asked about Varun Gandhis detention under the National Security Act, he said the law should take its own course but slapping the NSA was too harsh a step as the act was meant for those considered a threat to the nation.        
	Farooq batted for Varuns cousin Rahul Gandhi. Rahul will become the Prime Minister of India and I have no doubt about it. I also feel that the (Congress-led) UPA will form the next government at the Centre, he said.

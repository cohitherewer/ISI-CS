          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Oct. 16: Despite a high court diktat released 45 days ago, no relief has reached the parents of a convict who died while serving a sentence in Choudwar jail.         
	Small-time farmers Chaitanya Behera, 71, and Labani, 60, have been living in penury ever since their son died. A senior citizen, Chaitanya lost his right hand from the shoulder to a malignant tumour.         
	In a bid to ensure succour for them, Orissa High Court had on August 27 directed the government to pay a monthly relief of Rs 1,500 to both for the rest of their lives.        
	Arun Kumar Budhia, the lawyer representing the couple, said the court had directed the home department to ensure the payment by the 10th of every month from September. Government is yet to comply with the orders, he said.         
	No action has been taken even after communicating the order to the home department, Budhia pointed.        
	Chaitanya and Labani are residents of Nurukesabarini village in Badamba area of Cuttack.         
	Their son Krushna Chandra Behera, 43, was sentenced to life in a case of dowry death in 2003. He died on June 10, 2008, after another jail convict stabbed him. The couple had demanded social security of Rs 10 lakh.        
	The court had initially ensured payment of interim relief of Rs 50,000 by the government. Later, a two-judge bench of Acting Chief Justice I.M. Quddusi and Justice Sanju Panda had gone ahead to give the landmark verdict by awarding life-time relief instead of the usual one-time compensation.        
	Holding jail officers prima facie guilty for the death, the court said that the state was duty bound to protect the fundamental rights of prisoners.         
	Krushna was stabbed by Pratap Khatei, a lifer, with a broken steel utensil (karchuli) used to serve food.               
	He was found bleeding from his stomach near a jail lavatory.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | N-pact bustle ahead of Paris trip
                                                                                                               N-pact bustle ahead of Paris trip
          JAYANTH JACOB                              
	New Delhi, June 10: France and India are moving fast on their bilateral civil nuclear pact ahead of Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs arrival in Paris on Monday.        
	French company Areva is close to finalising a contract for two nuclear reactors and is in talks with the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited, sources said.        
	The two advanced EPR nuclear reactors of 1,650MW capacity each will be set up in Jaitapur, Maharashtra. Negotiations on issues such as the civil liabilities in case of an accident are in an advanced stage.        
	The bilateral nuclear co-operation pact, signed during Singhs visit to Paris last September, has already reached the French Senate, the upper chamber of the European countrys parliament, for ratification.        
	France is making elaborate arrangements to welcome Singh, who will become the first foreign leader to be chief guest at the Bastille Day parade on Frances national day, July 14.        
	Several foreign leaders have attended the parade in the past but Singh is the first to be made chief guest, French ambassador Jerome Bonnafont told reporters here today.        
	The honour is Frances reciprocation for Indias gesture of inviting French President Nicolas Sarkozy as guest of honour at the Republic Day parade. It is a symbol of close co-operation between India and France, the ambassador said.        
	German President Horst Koehler and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen too will attend the parade in which 400 Indian airmen will participate.        
	The participation of Indian armed forces in the parade is an occasion to commemorate Indian soldiers participation on our side and in our territory during the two world wars, ambassador Bonnafont said.        
	Sarkozy will host a working lunch for Singh on July 14 and hold talks on a range of bilateral and global issues, including terrorism, civil nuclear trade, climate change, defence ties and the global financial crisis.        
	The French yesterday came out strongly in support of Indias call for reform of the United Nations and backed India for a permanent seat on the Security Council.

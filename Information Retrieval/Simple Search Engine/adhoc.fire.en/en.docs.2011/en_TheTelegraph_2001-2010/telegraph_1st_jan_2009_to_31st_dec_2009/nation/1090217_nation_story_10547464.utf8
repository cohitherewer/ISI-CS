	New Delhi, Feb. 16 (PTI): A US special envoy today said Taliban operating out of Pakistan posed a common threat to India and America as well as the host country.        
	Richard Holbrooke, President Barack Obamas special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, met external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee, national security adviser M.K. Narayanan and foreign secretary Shivshankar Menon here.        
	For the first time in 60 years, your country, Pakistan and the US all face an enemy that poses direct threats to our leaderships, our capitals and our people, Holbrooke said.         
	The envoy was here to listen to Indias assessment of the situation in Pakistan and Afghanistan.        
	Holbrooke, who does not have India on his mandate, made it clear that he carried no messages or guidance but just wanted to hear the views of India on a wide range of issues.

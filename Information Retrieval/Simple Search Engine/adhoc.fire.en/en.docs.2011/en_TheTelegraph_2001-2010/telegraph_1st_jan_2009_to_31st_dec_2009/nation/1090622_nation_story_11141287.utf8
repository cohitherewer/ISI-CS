The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Maoist strike kills 12 jawans
                                                                                                               Maoist strike kills 12 jawans
          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, June 21: Twelve CRPF jawans were killed in Chhattisgarh yesterday when Maoists blew up their truck using a landmine and sprayed bullets aiming at the vehicle.        
	Initially, the toll was given as five but police later updated it to 12. Seven Maoists were also killed in the gun battle.        
	The jawans appeared to have made themselves vulnerable in Maoist-infested Dantewada when, in their rush to get out of a forest, they gave up walking and climbed into a truck that the rebels targeted.         
	The jawans were returning from a village where the Maoists had set trucks of a contractor on fire. The police believe this was the Maoists ploy to bring out the jawans before they could be attacked.        
	The evening blast tossed the jawans truck several feet into the air, sources said. Three to four jawans died from the impact.        
	The jawans were returning on foot. They boarded the vehicle (truck) to save time. That cost them dear, a senior police officer said.         
	Bastar inspector-general of police T.J. Langkumer said the rebels opened fire after the blast.        
	Other jawans who were moving ahead of the truck rushed back to the blast site and returned fire, killing the seven Maoists.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Policy shift on private running of colleges
                                                                                                               Policy shift on private running of colleges
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 12: The Centre plans to allow private societies to run new elite colleges envisioned for backward districts in a departure from a policy that has sought to restrict private participation to developed areas.         
	The decision is also contrary to the recommendations of the team of experts that drafted the blueprint for the colleges. It said the institutions should be managed completely by the government.        
	The human resource development ministry has told states they can run the colleges themselves, or manage them in a public-private partnership, or hand them over to creditable private societies to run.         
	In a letter to the chief secretaries, the higher education secretary has asked the states to urgently identify the locations for the colleges apart from their preferred mode (or modes) of management.         
	The colleges are to come up in 374 districts identified as having lower access to higher education than the national average.         
	But the final outline of the plan for these model colleges contrasts with the UPAs policy till now on involving private players in planned education growth. The government has officially welcomed private parties to enter the education sector but has, as a rule, planned for them to focus on educationally and economically better-off areas.         
	Two factors have principally contributed to this policy. First, government officials fear that backward areas may not prove economically lucrative for private parties, who may be tempted to wind up and quit their responsibility midway.        
	Second, private parties would want to charge higher fees than the government for institutions they run  legitimately, government officials accept. In educationally backward regions, higher fees would discourage potential students from enrolling in a school or college.         
	Using private-sector funding for better-off areas saves government money for use in backward regions.        
	A six-member UGC team set up to prepare the blueprint for the model colleges specifically recommended against the public-private partnership mode of management.        
	But HRD ministry officials are arguing that there is no logic in barring private societies with an established reputation from managing the model colleges.

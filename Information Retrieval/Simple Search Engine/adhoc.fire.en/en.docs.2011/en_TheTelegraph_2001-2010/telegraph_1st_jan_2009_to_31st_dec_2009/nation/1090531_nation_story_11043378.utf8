The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Trophy hospital loses 9-yr damages fight
                                                                                                               Trophy hospital loses 9-yr damages fight
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                          The PJI Chandigarh campus                                  
	New Delhi, May 30: PGI Chandigarh, one of the countrys topmost medical institutes, will have to pay Rs 2 lakh to the family of a woman who died after a mismatched blood transfusion.        
	PGI had fought a nine-year battle to avoid paying the sum, dragging the award through the courts since the Punjab consumer commission ruled against it in February 2000. Yesterday, the Supreme Court ruled against the institute.        
	Wrong blood transfusion is an error no hospital/doctor exercising ordinary care would have made. (It) is not an error of professional judgement but a sure instance of medical negligence, the court said.        
	Harjit Kaur had been admitted to a private hospital in Ludhiana on March 30, 1996, after suffering 50 per cent burns in her arms, trunk and legs while making tea over a stove.        
	On April 19, after her condition had stabilised, husband Jaspal Singh shifted her to the government-run Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, to save costs.        
	At the PGI, her condition continued to improve under the care of Dr Varun Kulshrestha, senior resident doctor, department of plastic surgery. On May 20, however, the woman with A+ blood was transfused with B+ blood. Even as her haemoglobin levels plunged and urea levels rocketed, she was given another bottle of B+ blood the next day.        
	Jaspal complained, and an inquiry revealed a mismatched transfusion. Kaur, her kidney and liver severely affected, died on July 1.        
	Jaspal and his then minor son Amandeep moved the Punjab consumer commission accusing Dr Kulshrestha and other PGI medical staff of negligence and claiming a compensation of Rs 9 lakh.        
	Dr Kulshrestha argued the mismatched transfusion did not result from any negligence on his part. He claimed Kaur had recovered from it thanks to the care he and the nursing staff provided.        
	He said Kaur had died of septicaemia (poisoning of blood by severe infection) as a complication from her burns, and not because of mismatched transfusion. PGI offered the same defence.        
	The commission, however, ruled against the institute and on February 1, 2000, asked it to pay Rs 50,000 to Jaspal and make a fixed deposit of Rs 1.5 lakh in Amandeeps name.         
	The national consumer commission threw out PGIs appeal on September 29, 2000, prompting the institute to move the Supreme Court. It again made the septicaemia plea.        
	But the court said: Although she survived for 40 days after the mismatched blood transfusion it cannot be said there was no causal link (with) her death. The hospitals breach of duty in mismatched blood transfusion contributed to her death, if not wholly, surely materially.        
	The ruling comes two weeks after the apex court set an Indian record by ordering a Hyderabad hospital to pay Rs 1 crore to a patient paralysed waist down after surgery.        
	Compensation is rarely paid in medical negligence cases in India, with the hospitals filing appeal after appeal. The courts too avowedly tend to give doctors the benefit of the doubt.

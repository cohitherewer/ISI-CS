The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Modi rustles up motley crew
                                                                                                               Modi rustles up motley crew
  - Bootlegger to drug peddler to fraud, all in FRAY          SANKARSHAN THAKUR IN DAHOD                                                  
	Baburam Katara flared into such infamy three years ago, the BJP had to quickly extinguish his career; the MP from this weather-beaten tribal seat had been nabbed profiting from illicit export of women whod accompany him abroad on a spouse ticket, then vanish into the large league of illegal immigrants.         
	Katara was summarily sacked, and the BJP claimed moral revenues from making an example of errantry.         
	But its made quick amends for that lapse into correctness  Katara has not been reinstated, but his ticket has gone to an equally, if not more, dubious and sullied player.         
	Morality brownies are nice on the side, realpolitik demands hardboiled choices. Somji Damor, the BJPs man from Dahod, is one of the states best-known and most prosperous bootleggers, lord of such fancied local contraband as Damor Vodka and Damor Premium Whiskey, distilled lawfully in Jhabua, just a few kilometres across the dry fence in Madhya Pradesh.         
	Those who have chosen to partake of Damors bottled bounty would tell you each case comes embossed with a personal guarantee of purity and excellence  the honourable Somjis bust.         
	Local BJP leaders are aghast and irate at Damors choice. Not merely because of the mans established notoriety but also because till the other day, Damor was a Congressman.         
	Its true Damor has won Dahod several times and has a vote bank, but his credibility among people is at an end, we have replaced a liability in (Baburam) Katara with a liability imported from the Congress, God only knows why, says one of them.         
	But look farther afield in Gujarat and Damors choice begins to fit into a pattern that has left BJP cadres frustrated and given the Congress a few reasons to hope and smile. In his pursuit of crafting a bench personally loyal to him rather than to the BJP, Narendra Modi may have hacked away at both the party and his own poll prospects; counting on their ability to win by hook or by crook, he has awarded tickets to tainted hands all across the state.         
	The Congress is elated Modi has done half the job for them; BJP workers have been left annoyed and, in several places, indifferent.         
	In Modis home district of Patan in north Gujarat, for instance, BJP cadres are lumbering unenthusiastically for Bhausinh Rathod, the man handed the party ticket. He is a former Congressman and alleged narcotics peddler to boot. We have our own traditional base here, complained one senior local leader, and we could have found a good candidate from among ourselves, why should we be lumped with a former Congressman whose bad reputation we have to defend all the time?         
	But the BJPs woes dont end with having to shoulder the burdens of tarnished Congressmen adopted by Modi. Theres a string of others who, though they have a history with the party, carry ruined enough reputations for the Congress to benefit from them.         
	The high-profile Bharatsinh Solankis BJP opponent in Anand, for instance, is Deepak Sathi, who has served a term in jail for alleged embezzlement of tens of crores of rupees that led to the collapse of the once-vaunted Charotar Cooperative Bank.         
	Anand is almost a cosmopolitan constituency in Gujarat terms, full of educated people and NRIs, says Bahubali Patel, a local businessman and professed BJP supporter, why should they trust a man like Deepak Sathi, who they know has defrauded them of hundreds of thousands? Could the BJP not find another leader?         
	In Navsari, another co-operative bank scamster, C.R. Patil, has got Modis nod. Patil was involved in the collapse of Matupura Bank, another private co-op initiative that was bungled by its major stakeholders. In Sabarkantha, Mahendrasinh Chauhan, a local doctor widely held responsible for dereliction during an outbreak of hepatitis a few months back, bagged the ticket ahead of other contenders.         
	The Rajkot seat went to Kiran Patel, a small industrialist who joined the BJP only two days ahead of being nominated. In Panchmahals, Modis man against the formidable Shankarsinh Vaghela of the Congress is Prabhatsinh Chauhan, a rich entrepreneur who has made his pile in questionable ways  his son Pravinsinh Chauhan is a bootlegger listed with the police.         
	Thats not the only baggage the Chauhans carry, though. They enjoy a fresh record of political failure. Prabhatsinh lost the last Assembly election from Godhra by more than 25,000 votes and son Pravinsinh nearly forfeited his deposit as an Independent from neighbouring Kalol.         
	Such is Modis sway over the state BJP that nobody has dared protest openly  not even the central party leadership  but there is more than a murmur of disquiet in state party circles at the way in which the chief minister is sacrificing the partys image and interests in an attempt to enhance his own support base.         
	Admits a former dissident who has now given in to Modis autocracy: The cold fact is that L.K. Advani (Gandhinagar) and former Union minister Harin Pathak (Ahmedabad) are the only two people out of 26 who are not Modis direct choices, the rest are all his men, all his whim, even Kanshiram Rana was denied Surat and the party may lose the seat because his replacement (Darshana Jardosh) is a newcomer. But Modi wanted Rana out and Darshana in, and that is what happened. Gujarat is about Modi, not about the BJP anymore.         
	He wouldnt take a wager on whether that was necessarily a good thing  for the party or even for Modi himself.

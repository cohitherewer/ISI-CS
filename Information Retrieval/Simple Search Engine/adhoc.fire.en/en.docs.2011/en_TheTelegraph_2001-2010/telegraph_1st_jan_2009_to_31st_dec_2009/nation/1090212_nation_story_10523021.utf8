          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	New Delhi, Feb. 11: India is easing entry regulations for foreign students and taking special steps to ensure they are not harassed under its most concerted effort yet to market the country as a global higher education destination.        
	Monitored by the Prime Minister, different arms of the government have together formulated Indias first comprehensive strategy to woo foreign students as part of Manmohan Singhs vision to make India a global knowledge hub.        
	The Indian Council for Cultural Research has been placed in charge of co-ordinating the implementation of the blueprint.        
	The number of foreign students in India has increased by 300 per cent since 2000. It had 25,947 foreign students in 2006 compared to 6,998 in 2000, according to figures available with the human resource development ministry. But at least three times as many Indian students  over 80,000  go just to the US every year.        
	The marketing of Indian higher education will begin at the missions in different countries, under the blueprint finalised between the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) and the ministries of home, external affairs and HRD.        
	The changes in our current policy are likely to be notified any time, after which they will be issued to all universities. The rules may be in place for the 2009 academic session, a senior PMO official said.        
	Each mission will provide personalised counselling to students seeking to pursue higher education in India, including details of universities, and the documentation required to study here.        
	Students will be given visas that will allow them to enter India thrice within an academic year to facilitate visits to their home countries during vacations or emergencies.        
	The home ministry will provide provisional registration on arrival to foreign students once they provide student certificates from the university where they have enrolled. They will have 90 days from the date of arrival to get a final registration on providing proof of permanent residence, which will include hostel accommodation.        
	Missions will specially identify research scholars keen on studying in India to expedite the grant of research visas except in cases where the research involves travel to parts of the country deemed sensitive by the government.        
	The Educational Consultants India Limited, under the HRD ministry, will be asked to empanel a cadre of registered and trained student agents to ensure foreigners are not duped by fake agents.        
	The UGC will be given special funds to disburse to universities to build international student centres that are to work as nodal points to assist foreigners in each university.        
	Each university is to provide six English language proficiency courses  for foreign students who need assistance with the language. For students who need these courses, the visa shall include the extra six-month period required.        
	The finance ministry is to assist foreign students with bona fide certificates to open bank accounts in India.        
	The blueprint also aims to put in place mechanisms to check misuse of the new norms. It requires colleges and universities to provide details of all foreign students to the Foreigners Registration Regional Office (FRRO) every six months. These details are then to be shared on an internal database with all missions abroad, with the home ministry, the external affairs ministry and the HRD ministry.

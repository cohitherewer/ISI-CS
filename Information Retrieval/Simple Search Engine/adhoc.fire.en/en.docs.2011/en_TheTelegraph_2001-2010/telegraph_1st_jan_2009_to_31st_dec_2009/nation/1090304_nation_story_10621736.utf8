The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Beating code by a whisker
                                                                                                               Beating code by a whisker
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, March 3: The UPA government launched its largest new education scheme after five years in power only 36 minutes before the announcement of the election schedule clipped its powers to initiate populist measures.        
	At 2.54pm yesterday, the government quietly flagged off the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) to universalise secondary education, beating the announcement of the election schedule, slated for 3.30pm.        
	The governments rush and the schemes launch are legal under election rules. They, however, demonstrate the desperation that grips an outgoing government to beat the poll announcement.         
	This desperation has seen ministers fly across the country to lay foundation stones over the past fortnight.        
	By the time chief election commissioner N. Gopalaswami began reading out the schedule for the worlds largest democratic exercise at Nirvachan Sadan, the human resource development ministry had issued letters notifying the scheme to all states.        
	The Rs 20,120-crore scheme, promised in the 2007 budget, was kicked off without fanfare, and ministry officials were breathing easy.        
	Its done, smiled an official as the CEC spoke on TV about a poll booth that would cater to only one voter.        
	The RMSA was approved by the cabinet last month and had been ready for launch for at least a week.         
	But human resource minister Arjun Singhs approval for the launch arrived at the ministry headquarters only around yesterday noon, when TV channels were blaring out that the elections would be announced in the afternoon.        
	Over the next two hours, sources said, a final draft of the notification was prepared. Officials began faxing the notification to various arms of the central government and to all the states, following up the fax with emails. The last communication notifying the launch was sent at 2.54pm.        
	Once elections are announced, a code of conduct kicks in, preventing the government from announcing new programmes.        
	The RMSA aims to replicate the success of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) at the secondary school stage.

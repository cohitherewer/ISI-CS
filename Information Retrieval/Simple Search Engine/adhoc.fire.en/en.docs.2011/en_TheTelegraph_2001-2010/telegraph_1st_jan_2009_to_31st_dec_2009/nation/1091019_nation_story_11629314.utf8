The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | UK patient data theft
                                                                                                               UK patient data theft
                            
	London, Oct. 18 (PTI): A British TV investigation has revealed that confidential medical records sent to India for computerisation are being offered for sale.        
	The investigation is scheduled to be broadcast on ITVs Tonight programme tomorrow.        
	Programme presenter Chris Rogers contacted two Indian salesmen through an Internet chat room posing as a marketing executive keen to buy medical records. Rogers bought 116 files with detailed records of British patients from the two salesmen, whom the programme named as Jaesh Bagchandnani and Kunal Gargatti.         
	Bagchandnani reportedly said the details came from staff at an Indian transcription centre, where medical records are computerised.        
	Bagchandnani told Rogers: We can do really good business with these leads. These leads will give you entire diagnoses of all the customers. There are 17 teams or you can say team managers. The floor managerswork for me.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | One for nation, another for state
                                                                                                               One for nation, another for state
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                        Reddy, (top) Naidu: Winners				                                       
	Hyderabad, May 16: Andhra Pradesh voted for India, then it voted for Andhra Pradesh.        
	For possibly the first time in the states history, its people have given an overwhelming mandate to the Congress at the Centre, while denying it such a lead in the Assembly.         
	In other words, those who voted the Congress for Delhi didnt necessarily do so for Hyderabad.        
	The Congress won 33 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats till this evening, but watched its Assembly tally slip to 156 seats from 185 in 2004. The Y.S.R. Reddy government is still poised to retain power because the figure is above the majority mark of 147 in the 294-member Assembly. Reddy himself won the Pulivendula seat by over 57,000 votes.         
	The biggest leap so far appears to have been made by Chandrababu Naidus Telugu Desam, which nearly doubled its tally in the Assembly to 91 from 47. Naidu won from Kuppam, for the fifth time, by a margin of 45,000.        
	The relatively good showing didnt spill over to the national contest, though, with the Desams tally settling at six Lok Sabha seats, almost unchanged over five in 2004.        
	Naidu might have Chiranjeevi a lot to curse for. The actors Praja Rajyam party appears to have cut into the votes that were said to have moved away from the ruling Congress, because of the anti-incumbency factor, towards the Desam.        
	Praja Rajyam itself was reeling from a debut shock, bagging only 18 Assembly seats. It drew a blank in the national contest.        
	Had it not been for the erosion of votes by the Praja Rajyam, Naidu could have been a clear winner, a senior political analyst said.        
	With the CPIs four, the CPMs one and the Telengana Rashtra Samitis 10 seats in the state, the Desam would have notched up 106 seats. That isnt close to the Congresss tally, but the analyst pointed out that Naidu could have drawn a lot of the votes that went to Chiranjeevis party in seats where his Praja Rajyam didnt win.        
	The results were a shock to the TRS, whose Lok Sabha tally was down to two from five in 2004. The winners were party chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao and Vijayashanti. Rao had switched from the grand alliance with the Left and the Desam to the NDA last Sunday.        
	The loss of face would have been greater for Rao, who boasted only 24 hours ago that he would be among the winning horses of the NDA and that a separate Telengana was only 100 days away. Now, it appears he will take much longer to reach that goal.        
	The Lok Sabha results threw up many upsets. The big one was that of Union minister Renuka Chowdhary, who lost from Khammam by close to 1.5 lakh votes.         
	The Congress also wasnt able to prevent the defeat of other senior leaders, including state ministers. Power minister Mohammed Ali Shabbir lost from Kamareddy, as did Speaker K.R. Suresh Reddy from the Armoor seat. Even state Congress chief D.Srinivas, an open critic of chief minister Reddy, had to taste defeat.        
	The Desam, too, had its reverses. K. Yerran Naidu, its parliamentary party leader, was trounced in Srikakulam. The deputy general secretary of the CPI, S. Sudhakar Reddy, lost from Nalgonda.        
	The Praja Rajyams Allu Aravind, a film producer fighting his first election, was defeated in Anakapalle. U.V. Krishnam Raju, the partys candidate from Rajahmundry, was also rejected by voters.        
	Prominent Lok Sabha winners from the Congress included junior Union human resources development minister D. Purandareswari, who contested from Visakhapatnam. The others were Y.S. Janmohan Reddy from Kadapa and Panabaka Lakshmi from Bapatla.

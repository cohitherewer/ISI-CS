The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Court junks PIL
                                                                                                               Court junks PIL
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Feb. 26: Virtually bowing to the ground reality, judges of Orissa High Court have backed off from monitoring the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporations (BMC) single-point garbage disposal project at Bhuasini after the project made no progress since the last year.        
	The court was monitoring the project since April 2008 as a part of a PIL hearing.         
	Without offering any explanation, the two-judge bench of Justice Laxmikanta Mohapatra and Justice Indrajit Mahanty yesterday declared the PIL closed, following the submission of an affidavit by Orissa State Pollution Control Board.         
	The board, in its affidavit, expressed its inability to implement the court order to initiate criminal proceedings against BMC commissioner Aparajita Sarangi. The affidavit clarified that the orders were not within the powers of the board.         
	In January 28, the court had ordered the board to initiate criminal proceedings under Section 15 of the Pollution Control Act. Advocate S.N. Panda had filed the PIL in 2002 seeking a proper solid-waste management process in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack. The court had been pressing for a single-point garbage disposal system since August 2007 from the BMC.         
	The government had allotted 61.41 acres at Bhuasuni on the outskirts of Bhubaneswar and Khurda collector had handed it over to the civic body in February 2008.

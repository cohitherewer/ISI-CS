	Mumbai, Feb. 2: A 22-year-old Russian allegedly committed suicide today by jumping out of the window of his 16th-floor room at the Trident hotel in south Mumbai, police said.         
	The man, identified as Adrian Alexander, an employee of the Russian Aeroflot airline, checked in with four colleagues last night. They were part of the crew of Aeroflots Flight 567, the police said.         
	The group was staying in rooms 1603 and 1615 in the 35-storey hotel.         
	Alexander was staying in room 1603. He received a phone call around 1am and was agitated over the conversation. After the phone call, he was upset about something. He ran across the room and flung himself out of the window around 2am, a Marine Drive police officer said.         
	The 22-year-old landed on the first floor near the hotel swimming pool and was rushed to Bombay Hospital with multiple fractures all over his body and a bleeding nose.         
	At 4am, he was taken to the CT scan room where he succumbed to his injuries at 6am, doctors at the hospital said.         
	The airline captain and officials from the Russian consulate, who visited the hospital, were not available for comment.         
	It is not clear what caused him to take this step, but we have registered an accident report and are investigating the case, a police officer said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 15: The Samruddha Odisha released its election manifesto today, promising to eradicate poverty from Orissa within five years if it is voted to power.        
	We will not contest the next elections if we cant remove poverty within five years of coming to power. Samruddha Odishas fight will be with poverty, not with anybody else, said founder president Jatish Chandra Mohanty.         
	The regional outfit, floated by the bureaucrat-turned politician in October 2007, stressed on welfare of farmers, women and students. Besides promises galore for the neglected agriculture sector of the state, the party promised free LPG connections to all newly married women and independent courts for speedy disposal of cases relating to atrocities on women.         
	The outfit stressed on supporting farmers with easy agricultural loans and good quality pesticides and fertilisers and also on issues like ending Maoist menace and creating an environment of communal harmony.        
	In its next beam of rural development, the manifesto promised good health, eradication of poverty and unemployment in the state.        
	Alleging that rampant corruption, nepotism and violence growing in the state, Mohanty said despite the tall promises and lip sympathies showered by the government, crores of rupees being spent on education, health and housing were not reaching the real beneficiaries. The party has decided to field candidates in all 147 Assembly and 21 Lok Sabha constituencies. We will have transparent candidates, and maintain all respect for the election code, said Mohanty.

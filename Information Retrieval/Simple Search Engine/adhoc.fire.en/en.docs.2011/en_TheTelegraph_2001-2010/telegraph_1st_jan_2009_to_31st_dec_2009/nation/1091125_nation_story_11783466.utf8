The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cure-all pill: communal violence bill
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cure-all pill: communal violence bill
          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 24: Justice Manmohan Singh Liberhans 17-year mission hasnt burdened the Congress much with administrative dilemmas like punitive action against Sangh parivar rivals, but has given it enough fodder to torment its main adversary for a long time to come.        
	A hint of what the ruling party intends to do with the report came from spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi.        
	This is the past of the BJP, this is the present and this is the future, he said after the report had underscored the need to separate politics from religion.        
	The recommendations, apart from familiar noises on police and administrative reforms, are like ingredients of a political charter against communalism.        
	Deficient in actionable details but high on rhetoric, they evoked enthusiastic response from the government.        
	Although the governments action taken report (ATR)  laden with phrases like agreed, accepted and noted  suggests no concrete action might be taken, sources in the ruling party made no attempt to hide their glee at Liberhans secular sermons.        
	But wherever concrete action has been demanded, they have tried to take cover behind the proposed communal violence bill.        
	Singhvi went to the extent of saying that communal elements would have been wiped out of Indias political scene had the legislation on communal violence been in the statute book at the time of the Ayodhya movement.        
	The government, which has not indicated any decision to take punitive action against those indicted in the ATR, has, however, kept a window open, promising follow-up action after legal consultations.        
	We have not rejected the recommendations. Each and every recommendation has been accepted and noted. The government is bound to take positive action, law minister Veerappa Moily said after the ATR was tabled in Parliament.        
	Asked what action the government was thinking of, Moily said: The Liberhan commission is a fact-finding mission and further to that each ministry is expected to take off on that and take action. The ATR is clearly an indictment of 68 persons, who are responsible for the episode. The government has to take positive action.         
	By promising to examine further the recommendation for barring governments formed on the premise of religion and disqualifying parties that have religious issues in their manifestos, the Congress has reserved the right to drag the BJP into further trouble.        
	The government has also noted a recommendation regarding the Election Commission. It says the panel must ensure that any complaint about attempts to misuse religious sentiments or to appeal to voters sense of piety through, say, rallies at places of worship must result in swift action and possible disqualification.        
	Several ministers agreed that the report was a rejection of the BJPs ideology and that would cause much greater damage to the Opposition party than mere indictment of some senior leaders.        
	The BJP leaders used to cite the Supreme Court judgment that said Hindutva is a way of life to defend their politics. This report lays bare the entire conspiracy to exploit religious sentiments to grab power, a minister of state said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Modest goal for Cong in hockey cradle
                                                                                                               Modest goal for Cong in hockey cradle
          JAYANTH JACOB IN BHOPAL                          The Congress headquarters in Bhopal. (A Sami Faruqui)                                   
	A few minutes drive separates the Sports Authority of Indias regional centre from the state Congress headquarters here; a continent separates their moods.        
	SAI staff in this cradle of hockey are ecstatic over Indias recent Azlan Shah win in Malaysia after 13 years, but the 10 spokespersons and 10 deputy spokespersons at Indira Bhavan are circumspect about a Congress turnaround in Madhya Pradesh this election.        
	Winning needs preparation. The reason the SAI centre is over the moon is that the national team trained here from last December before its Kuala Lumpur triumph this month.        
	One small fact gives the true picture of the Congresss preparation  the Hoshangabad seat, which state unit chief Suresh Pachauri had nurtured for some time with an eye on the polls, doesnt even have an office for the district unit. Actually, it doesnt even seem to have a district unit.        
	Hoshangabad Congress chief Arjun Paliya had resigned after the Assembly poll rout in all four seats in the district last year, taking away with him the entire district committee and its office  which was his home.        
	Half the district Congress offices in the state are the homes of their presidents, a Congress official said.        
	Scarred by the Assembly poll rout and dismayed by the organisational disarray, the Congress is, at best, cautiously optimistic  it hopes to win more than the three seats it bagged in Madhya Pradesh in 2004.        
	No Congress leader is talking of a stunner. Thats the sole preserve of hockey fans who still remember how Aslam Sher Khan  now Congress candidate from Sagar had scored a last-gap equaliser against Malaysia in 1975, setting up Indias only World Cup triumph.        
	Its the often-disunited Indian cricket teams of the 70s and 80s that the state Congress resembles more. Arjun Singh, Digvijay Singh, Kamal Nath, Pachauri, Jyotiraditya Scindia  they all hail from the state. But ego clashes have prevented Team Congress from pulling together, party sources say.        
	Candidate selection has been better compared with the state polls, some claim. Yet others wonder why Pachauri was forced to pull out of Hoshangabad because of his responsibilities as state unit chief when his Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh counterparts have entered the fray.        
	He would have given a tight fight, if not won. The present candidate, Uday Pratap Singh, is very ordinary, said auto parts dealer Sachin Jain.        
	Voter Alim Khan said neither the Congress candidate nor any party worker visited his village, just 35km from the district headquarters.        
	Nearby Vidisha is the best example of Congress ineptness. The BJPs Sushma Swaraj is set for a walkover because the nomination of the Congresss Raj Kumar Patel was rejected. I am the saddest man in the state Congress, Patel said, cooling his heels at home in Bhopal. He ducked questions of sabotage.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Obama fears Mumbai copycats
                                                                                                               Obama fears Mumbai copycats
                            
	Washington, Jan. 12 (PTI): President-elect Barack Obama has said he fears Mumbai-type attacks in other parts of the world, including the US, and declared that his administration would pile pressure on al Qaida, our major target.        
	(The) danger is always there, to have a Mumbai-type attack in an American city, Obama told ABC News in an interview yesterday, referring to the November siege. He said the attacks showed that terror had gone beyond familiar tactics and methods.         
	When you see what happened in Mumbai, that potentially points to a new strategy, not simply suicide bombings but you have commandos taking over... he said.        
	Obamas comments came two days after Vice-President-elect Joseph Biden visited Pakistan and urged Islamabad to co-operate in the probe into the Mumbai attack, which killed over 170 people, including several Americans.        
	I think you have to anticipate that having seen the mayhem created in Mumbai, there are going to be potential copycats or other terrorist organisations that think this is something they can replicate, Obama said.        
	The President-elect was echoing what top US intelligence and police officials told a congressional hearing on the strike last week.         
	The officials said the attack made it all the more necessary to ensure those responsible were brought to justice, given that US cities are always on top of the hit list of al Qaida and other terrorist groups.        
	Obama, too, harped on al Qaida, saying the threat would be one of his administrations primary areas of focus in international security. Weve got to continue to put pressure on al Qaida, which is our major target, he said.

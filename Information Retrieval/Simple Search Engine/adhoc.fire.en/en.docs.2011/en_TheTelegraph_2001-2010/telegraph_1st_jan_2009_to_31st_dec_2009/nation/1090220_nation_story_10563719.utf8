The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Corruption cry against judges
                                                                                                               Corruption cry against judges
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 19: The issue of corruption in the higher judiciary overrode the debate on a salary hike for judges in the Lok Sabha today.         
	Law minister H.R. Bharadwaj, who agreed that corruption in the higher judiciary was a cause for concern, however, said the bill to raise the salaries of Supreme Court and high court judges should have been passed without any controversy or acrimony.         
	Bharadwaj defended the governments decision to issue an ordinance in January, saying he wanted to give relief to the judges as soon as possible because secretaries to the central government and registrars of courts were getting higher salaries than the judges following the implementation of the sixth pay commission.        
	Many MPs, however, chose to focus on corruption and the high pendency of cases.        
	CPM member Varkala Radhakrishnan argued that judges should not expect salary from the government as they dont listen to anybody on judicial appointments.         
	As Radhakrishnan continued his tirade despite discouragement from the deputy Speaker, who was conducting the House, Bharadwaj told the MP not to use stupid words and requested the Chair to ask the gentleman to behave.         
	No matter how critical we become of the judges, the public perception in the country is that the judiciary is doing better than the other organs of democracy, Bharadwaj said.         
	But Radhakrishnan kept on demanding a national judicial commission and greater accountability from the judges.         
	Ajoy Chakraborty of the CPI went a step ahead, asserting that everybody in the country knew about corruption in the higher judiciary and that the activities and dealings of judges have become very suspicious.        
	When a few MPs cautioned him against generalisation, Chakraborty said he meant not all of them but many. People have lost faith in the judges and it is strange that they are refusing to declare their assets, he added.        
	Other members such as Prasanna Acharya of the BJD, Rasa Singh Rawat and Bachi Singh Rawat of the BJP, and Reoti Raman Singh of the Samajwadi Party, who supported the hike, also expressed concern over judicial corruption.         
	Some members said judges alone could not be blamed for the inordinate delay in cases.         
	Most MPs, however, sought more legal instruments to supplement the impeachment option to rein in judges.         
	Bharadwaj said the standing committee had made valuable suggestions to improve the draft of the judges inquiry bill, which would be tabled in the next House.         
	The minister also asserted the supremacy of Parliament over the judiciary. On the corruption case involving Calcutta High Court judge Soumitra Sen, he said the Chief Justice of Indias recommendation was not required and proceedings could have been started with the signature of 100 MPs.                     
	Bharadwaj, however, raised many eyebrows when he said: I am senior to the CJI in age and experience. I will decide on impeachment. But there is no time left in this House.

	Srinagar, Jan. 3: A gunfight raging for three days in a Jammu forest has killed three security force personnel and four Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Toiba militants, police said today.        
	The encounter began on Thursday evening in Mendhar, Poonch district, following intelligence about the presence of militants in the Batidar forest.        
	The inspector-general of police, Jammu, said a Pakistani Jaish commander, Dawood, was believed to be trapped in the forest. He is either dead or is still at the encounter site.        
	Sources said six to seven Lashkar and Jaish guerrillas were still hiding in the forest, which the police and 39 Rashtriya Rifles are combing.        
	The militants opened heavy fire on the troops when we cordoned off the area, Jammu police chief K. Rajendra said. Four militants and two soldiers were killed on Thursday and Friday. Firing broke out again this morning while the security forces were searching the area. One special police officer was killed.        
	The slain soldiers are Junior Commissioned Officer Rakesh Kumar and Naik P.K. Singh. The dead SPO is Naresh Kumar.        
	The firing is going on intermittently. Some more militants are believed to be trapped there, an army source said.        
	This is the second-longest encounter in the state since October and comes amid preparations for the swearing-in of chief minister-elect Omar Abdullah in Jammu on Monday.         
	Thirteen militants were killed in an eight-day operation last October on the 14,000-foot Chamarasar Ridge along the Harmukh Range in Bandipora district.        
	Jammu and Kashmir police chief Kuldeep Khoda recently said militancy had fallen sharply in the past one year, with only 800-odd rebels active in the state.        
	RDX haul        
	Security forces have busted a militant hideout in Baramulla district and recovered a large quantity of explosives, including 10kg RDX, sources said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | All cases not to be tested in flu zones
                                                                                                               All cases not to be tested in flu zones
          G.S. MUDUR                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 13: India has changed its pandemic flu management strategy with health officials announcing today that it was not necessary to test or treat every flu patient in areas where the H1N1 virus has established itself.         
	Medical experts, who have argued that India is wasting resources and delaying treatment for high-risk patients by trying to test and treat every patient with the antiviral drug oseltamivir, have welcomed the decision.         
	In Mumbai, Pune and in Delhi, the infection has been established. In these cities, testing of each individual patient is not necessary, said Rakesh Kumar Srivastava, the director-general of health services.         
	Doctors there may initiate treatment on the basis of clinical findings, without a test, Srivastava said. The doctors at the government-designated flu assessment centres in these cities, he said, would also determine whether a patient needs the antiviral drug or could be sent home with paracetamol to reduce fever and be asked to wait and watch for signs of serious illness.         
	Srivastava said there was a mismatch between the demand and capacity in Indias 18 government flu testing laboratories. There are far too many samples coming in, he said.         
	The count of flu-infected people confirmed through laboratory tests rose to 1,283 today. Twenty persons have died so far. Most of the fatalities are among patients who reported late for treatment, Srivastava said.         
	Health officials also said that Maharashtra, which has seen the rapid spread of the virus in Pune and Mumbai, has classified patients into three groups  each of which would have different initial treatment protocols.         
	Patients with mild fever and cold, cough or sore throat would be advised to stay at home without the antiviral and asked to look out for serious illness, patients with high fever and pharyngitis would be provided the antiviral and home quarantine, patients with acute respiratory distress would be hospitalised, tested and provided early treatment.         
	Similar patient classification strategies could be considered in other areas with evidence of significant local transmission, said Shiv Lal, director of the National Institute of Communication Diseases.         
	Public health experts have welcomed the patient classification strategy, saying it would help doctors quickly identify and treat patients who are at high risk of serious disease and reduce unnecessary strain on health services.         
	This will shift the focus on finding patients who are most likely to become very ill from the infection, Manish Kakkar, a specialist on infectious diseases at the Public Health Foundation of India, New Delhi, said.        
	The governments earlier advisory asking all people with cold, cough and fever to visit designated facilities for clinical assessment had put enormous strain on both hospitals and testing centres.

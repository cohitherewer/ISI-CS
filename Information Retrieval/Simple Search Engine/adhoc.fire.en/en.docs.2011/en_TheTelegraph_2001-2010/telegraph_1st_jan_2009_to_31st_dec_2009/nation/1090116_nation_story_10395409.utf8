	Thiruvananthapuram, Jan. 15: A Kerala court has sentenced 62 people to life imprisonment for murdering eight fishermen on the Marad beach in Kozhikode in 2003.        
	The convicts, all Muslims, had come in boats with swords and machetes and killed or seriously injured the backward class Hindu fishermen in retaliation of a feud over drinking water that had resulted in the death of five people.

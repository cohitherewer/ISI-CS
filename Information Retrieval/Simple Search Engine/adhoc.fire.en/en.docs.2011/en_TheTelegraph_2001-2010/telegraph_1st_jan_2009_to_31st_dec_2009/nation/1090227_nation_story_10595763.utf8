          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 26: Commuters along the Bhubaneswar-Cuttack and Bhubaneswar-Puri routes faced a harrowing time today as private buses kept off the roads following an indefinite strike called by the Orissa Private Bus Owners Association.         
	The association was protesting a mob attack on a bus after it allegedly ran over a man near Palasuni on NH-5. The victim, who died on the spot, was a worker in one of the roadside hotels. The local people set fire to the vehicle and blocked the highway for hours. Police resorted to lathicharge to control the mob and arrested 15 people.         
	According to bus operators, the deceased was injured after being hit by a private car and was lying on the roadside.        
	They claimed that the bus driver hit roadside shops, while trying to negotiate a curve and spoke to the police commissioner regarding the matter. The administration has requested the association to call of the strike, however, members have asked the district to clear illegal roadside dhabas and shops first. We will continue the strike till demands are met, said secretary Debendra Sahu.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bypass better for diabetics 
                                                                                                               Bypass better for diabetics 
          G.S. MUDUR                     Prime Minister Manmohan Singh,who has diabetes, had a bypass surgery in January                          
	New Delhi, March 21: Coronary bypass surgery may be better than angioplasty for heart patients who also have diabetes, according to a new analysis of long-term death rates in patients after the two treatment options.         
	The analysis, which pooled long-term mortality data from 10 studies in Brazil, Europe and the US, has found that patients with diabetes, and older patients, have a significant survival advantage if treated with a bypass.         
	It examined trials involving 3,889 patients who had undergone a bypass surgery and 3,923 patients who had an angioplasty and found that overall mortality was similar in patients who had a bypass (15 per cent) and an angioplasty (16 per cent).         
	However, the death rates among patients with diabetes five years after follow-up was 12 per cent if they had undergone a bypass, and 20 per cent if they had an angioplasty.         
	Whether you have diabetes really makes a big difference, said Mark Hlatky, professor of health research and policy at Stanford University, and lead author of the new study published on Thursday in the medical journal Lancet.         
	Over several years, theres a much lower rate of death with bypass surgery, Hlatky said. The patients age was another major factor that affected the outcomes.         
	The analysis also showed that in patients older than 65, the long-term mortality rate was 11 per cent for those who had a bypass, and 15 per cent for those who opted for an angioplasty.         
	The doctors have cautioned that the new findings do not apply to all patients with coronary heart disease, but only to the group of patients who are  after medical consultations  in a position to choose between a bypass and an angioplasty.         
	For instance, bypass is the appropriate treatment for patients with extensive blockages in three blood vessels or with disease in the left main coronary artery.         
	The doctors also said it was still unclear why surgery is better than angioplasty for this group of patients. This is a very important and provocative observation that needs to be investigated further, Hlatkty said.         
	Cardiologists here said the findings are relevant to India where the number of patients with diabetes exceeds 40 million and would allow doctors to recommend and patients to opt between bypass and surgery from better informed positions.         
	A good proportion of our heart patients also have diabetes, said Amal Kumar Banerjee, a cardiologist at SSKM Hospital, Calcutta, and president-elect of the Cardiology Society of India.         
	A bypass surgery involves the introduction of new blood vessels to carry blood to the heart and bypass blocked arteries. In angioplasty, doctors use a catheter and balloon to clear a blockage and insert a tiny device called a stent to facilitate blood flow.         
	Both procedures are routinely carried out in India.         
	But cardiologists point out that the new analysis did not include drug-eluting stents  devices that release tiny amounts of drugs to prevent re-blockage of arteries  that are increasingly being used in angioplasty procedures.         
	Without (taking into account) drug-eluting stents, it (study) would not be seen as contemporary, said Suman Bhandari, a director and cardiologist at the Escorts Heart Institute and Research Centre, New Delhi. Hlatky and his colleagues have said trials that compare coronary bypass with angioplasty involving drug-eluting stents are still in progress.

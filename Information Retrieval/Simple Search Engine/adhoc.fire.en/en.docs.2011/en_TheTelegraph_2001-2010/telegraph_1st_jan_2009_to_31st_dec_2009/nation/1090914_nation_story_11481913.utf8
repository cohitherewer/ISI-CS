The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Samaritan cop rescues 8-yr-old Andhra kidnap victim
                                                                                                               Samaritan cop rescues 8-yr-old Andhra kidnap victim
          NALIN VERMA                            Sai and his saviour additional IG R. Malhar Viz. (Deepak Kumar)                                 
	Patna, Sept. 13: An eight-year-old boy from Andhra Pradesh has finally reached home, thanks to the prompt efforts made by the Bihar police and an IPS officer of the Bihar cadre who rescued Sai allegedly kidnapped and brought to the state.        
	Sai has been handed over to his parents in Andhra. We hope he will be able to give clues about his kidnappers, said R. Malhar Vidz, the additional inspector-general (headquarters), whose efforts helped Sai to reach home.        
	The boy was first spotted in the house of one Lalbabu Rai in Danapur area in June by the neighbours, who found him unusual  as in not a member of the family and neither a domestic help. Subsequently, they called in the police.        
	A police team, led by R. Malhar Vidz, a Tamilian who was earlier the Patna senior superintendent of police, then raided Rais house and recovered Sai.        
	Sai spoke both Tamil and Telugu but could write only Telugu, that too with difficulty, Malhar said, adding: I got the director of Patna Municipal Corporation, S. Kumar, also an Andhra resident to read what the boy had written when I asked him about his home. At first I couldnt figure out whether he was from Andhar Pradesh or Tamil Nadu.        
	Malhar kept Sai in Apna Ghar run by the government social welfare department on Bailey Road and resorted to Google engine to locate places that Sai had scribbled.         
	She also contacted Chennai commissioner Rajendran and with his help circulated Sais details in Viketan, a Tamil journal, and Star Vijay, a channel. But, that yielded no result.        
	Finally, the head of Sevalaya, a Chennai-based NGO, V. Murlidharan, noticed the report in the news channel and contacted Malhar and the Bihar government, offering to keep Sai in his Chennai-based remand home.        
	Murlidharan argued that it would be easy to trace Sais relatives if he was allowed to travel to Chennai, to a familiar environment, and kept around boys who spoke his language. Bihar government let Sevalaya take Sai to Chennai on August 26 after completing formalities. While searching around a railway station that Sai has named, Sevalaya people finally traced the boys address to Srinagar-Anakapalli.         
	The Tamil Nadu police handed Sai to his parents on September 8, Malhar said, adding: The parents had lodged an FIR about their missing son at the Anakapalli police station.         
	Despite our repeated efforts we failed to find out how Sai was abducted and how he had been brought to Bihar. Now, I am sure that he will reveal his story to the parents, Malhar told The Telegraph.

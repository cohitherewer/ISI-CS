                                                                                                               Pranab firm on handover
          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi/Islamabad, Jan. 16: Pranab Mukherjee today clarified there was no dilution in Delhis stand that Pakistan must hand over Mumbai terror suspects for trial under Indian laws.        
	We have never given up the demand that perpetrators of terror acts should be extradited to India. There is no question of a climbdown, the foreign minister said.        
	The fact remains that dastardly terror crimes were committed in India. Therefore, the perpetrators must face Indian justice. This is not an either/or situation because these things are not mutually exclusive.        
	The clarification came a day after comments Mukherjee made in a television interview were interpreted to mean that Delhi was agreeable to a fair trial for the suspects in Pakistan.        
	Pakistans extradition act of 1972 specifically provides for extradition even when there is no bilateral extradition treaty. The Saarc convention on terrorism also has the same intent and such provisions are there in other international instruments.        
	Mukherjee said major terrorist acts carried out in India had been planned in and launched from Pakistan, so transparent and verifiable investigations in that country could unravel the conspiracy.        
	We have been requesting Pakistan to take sincere and effective steps in that direction. Pakistan is obliged to investigate and prosecute the criminals, he said.        
	It is Pakistans responsibility that individuals based in Pakistan do not commit criminal acts in other countries and then have effective immunity simply because they are Pakistani nationals.        
	Mukherjees tough talk came on a day Pakistan foreign secretary Salman Bashir updated Indian high commissioner Satyabrata Pal in Islamabad on steps taken in connection with the 26/11 attacks.        
	The foreign secretary has conveyed to the Indian high commissioner the sequence and series of actions initiated by Pakistan in pursuance of its international obligations as well as those relating to the Mumbai attacks, Mohammad Sadiq, the Pakistan foreign office spokesperson, said.        
	He said Pal was informed that Pakistan had begun an official inquiry into the Mumbai strikes as announced by Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani on Tuesday.        
	The foreign secretary said it was important for Pakistan and India to chart the way forward on anti-terror co-operation and (stressed the) need for constructive bilateral engagement.        
	British foreign secretary David Miliband today arrived in Islamabad after talks with the Indian leadership. He met Gilani and foreign minister Mehmood Qureshi.        
	Sources said the talks focused on how to defuse tension between India and Pakistan and bring the 26/11 plotters to book.

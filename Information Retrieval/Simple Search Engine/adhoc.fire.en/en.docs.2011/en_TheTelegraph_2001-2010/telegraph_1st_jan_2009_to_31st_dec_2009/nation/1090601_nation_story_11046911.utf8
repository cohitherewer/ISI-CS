The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sharad hint: ties with BJP changing
                                                                                                               Sharad hint: ties with BJP changing
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                            Sharad (top), Nitish                                 
	New Delhi, May 31: The Janata Dal (United) today continued to stress its differences with the BJP, with party president Sharad Yadav saying the nature of the alliance had changed after the Lok Sabha elections.        
	What the alliance was earlier (before the polls) and what it is now are different, Sharad, who is also the NDA convener, said on the concluding day of the partys national executive.        
	After the conclave began here yesterday, Dal (United) leaders had accused the BJP of working against their candidates in Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh. Todays proceedings followed the same vein.        
	Sharad regretted the brinkmanship between the allies and launched a veiled attack on L.K. Advanis leadership by praising Atal Bihari Vajpayees.        
	Atalji ke zamane ki dhaar paida kar nahin paye (the BJP was unable to bring back the sharpness of the Vajpayee days), he said, adding that during the Vajpayee era, the Dal (United) had won seats outside Bihar too.        
	Sources said the dominant line of thinking during the national executive was for reviewing the relationship with the BJP.        
	Sharad, however, said his partys representatives would meet top BJP leaders and try to work out a solution to their differences.        
	Bihars Dal (United) chief minister Nitish Kumar, a rising star in national politics whom the Congress appears eager to befriend, too emphasised his partys independence from the BJP.        
	The BJP may not agree with us but we are different parties and we stand by what we think, Nitish said today.        
	Yesterday, the political resolution passed by the Dal (United) had demanded Scheduled Caste benefits for Dalit Muslims and Dalit Christians  a line opposed by the BJP. Sharad today argued that the caste system in India pervaded all religions, including Islam and Christianity.        
	Of late, the Dal (United) has also been talking about implementing the Sachar commission report for minority welfare in a big way. For Nitish, the Sachar recommendations can be the highway to bigger success in Bihar.        
	Nitishs move to provide reservation for Pasmanda (backward) Muslims in Bihar has already yielded results. Now with next years Assembly elections in mind, the chief minister is eyeing a bigger share of Bihars huge Muslim vote bank.         
	The Dal (United) knows that this can be done only if it distances itself from the BJP.        
	Party leaders have been criticising the BJP for raising the wrong issues during the elections. They have also hinted, without naming Narendra Modi, that the BJPs reliance on the Gujarat chief minister as a campaigner may have been a mistake.        
	Sharad has said the BJP failed to effectively project farmers leaders like its president, Rajnath Singh, B.S. Yeddyurappa, Parkash Singh Badal, Ajit Singh and even Nitish and himself to try and counter the appeal of Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi.

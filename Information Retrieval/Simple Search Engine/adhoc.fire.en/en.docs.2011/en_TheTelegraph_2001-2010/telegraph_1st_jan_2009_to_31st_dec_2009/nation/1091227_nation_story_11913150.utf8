                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Russians plead, Goa doors shut
                            
	Panaji, Dec. 26 (PTI): Two Russian girls who escaped an alleged rape attempt by a taxi driver on Anjuna beach have said they knocked on doors seeking help from local residents as the accused chased them, but were turned away.        
	Olga Tyurina, 29, and Irina Babayan, 25, said in their complaint that the taxi driver tried to rape them at an isolated spot on Anjuna, the beach where British teenager Scarlett Keeling was found dead last year after suspected rape.        
	The Russian girls said they ran towards a cluster of houses. When the driver threatened us, we immediately got down from the car and started running. He took out a baseball bat from the car and hit my right leg, but we still managed to run, Olga said in her statement to Anjuna police.        
	We ran towards some houses and knocked on the door of one of them and requested the occupants to call the police. However, nobody came out from the house and we heard someone from inside asking us to go away. We then started running through a field to the other houses for help, Olga said.        
	The complaint said Pramod Shirodkar, the driver who was arrested today, was following them and he was joined by two motorcycle-borne persons, possibly his accomplices.        
	We lay under a tree and therefore the driver could not find us. They went on searching as we waited for sunrise, the complaint said. The incident happened early on December 25.        
	Goa police have arrested Shirodkar on the charge of eve-teasing and threatening the Russians.        
	The police caught Shirodkar after tracking down his address from the taxi number provided by the girls.        
	The driver has been booked under sections 509, 323 and 506 of the IPC for eve-teasing, causing hurt and threatening, the police said, without giving details about the two motorcycle-borne persons.        
	We are still investigating, said a police officer. How can we divulge everything?

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                           
	Guwahati, Jan. 2: Union home minister P. Chidambaram blames poor luck for the blasts that killed five persons in Guwahati yesterday.        
	Assam police had nearly caught the first of the three bombers but he got away, dumping the explosive in a garbage vat, the minister said.        
	With a little bit of luck Assam police would have caught him. But this time, Assam police were not lucky. This time that chap was lucky. But next time, I am sure Assam police would be lucky, he said after a meeting of the Unified Command that is in charge of the states security.        
	Chidambaram added that the search was on and the DG tells me they will be able to capture him soon.        
	The bomber who got away and a second one have been identified, the minister said, but refused to reveal which outfit they belonged to.        
	As I said earlier, we will catch them. Assam police know the first person and they also know the third person, he said.         
	Assam police know who the person is, they know his name, they know him by face, they know his family. And they nearly succeeded in apprehending him. But just that little bit of luck was not there. He escaped. While escaping, he threw an IED device into a trash bin, which exploded, causing minor injuries to two persons.        
	The Ulfa has denied involvement. In a statement, it said that those who were trying to implicate it in the blasts were out to defame it and that investigations would reveal the perpetrators, as in the October 30 bombings.        
	Chidambaram said: I have seen the people injured in the Bhootnath incident. They are among the poorest people in Guwahati. I believe the area is very poor and very poor people live there. Many of them are Muslims.         
	The blast at Bhootnath market was the most powerful and caused all five deaths. Around 60 were injured in the three blasts.        
	The minister said the police had acted fast and launched a search for the militants after being tipped off about a possible militant strike.        
	We had intelligence about the blasts. In fact, intelligence was building up over the last few days. On the evening of December 31, we had shared intelligence with the state government. On the morning of January 1, I spoke to the chief minister. I must compliment Assam police for acting swiftly.        
	Message to militants        
	Chidambaram signalled a hardening of stand against militants in the state.         
	If the leaders of the banned organisations are listening to this, as I speak now, or read it about it in tomorrows newspapers or watch it on TV later in the day, they must get this message clear.         
	The chief minister and his government will deal with development issues and the security forces will deal decisively with those who are members of banned organisa- tions which threaten Indias sovereignty and security, the home minister said.

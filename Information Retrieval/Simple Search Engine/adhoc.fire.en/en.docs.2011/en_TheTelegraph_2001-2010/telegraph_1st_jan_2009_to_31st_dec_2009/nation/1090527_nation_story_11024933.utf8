The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Fetters off PoK travel
                                                                                                               Fetters off PoK travel
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Srinagar, May 26: At least one border with Pakistan has become irrelevant.        
	Any Indian citizen can now take the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus, after regional passport officials cleared a misconception that had restricted the service to members of divided families on either side of the Line of Control.        
	The fresh guidelines have come despite strained relations between the neighbours but are a follow-up to Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs assertion of making borders with Pakistan irrelevant.        
	Regional passport officer B.S. Manavalan said the rules had been framed when the Karvan-e-Aman service, as it is popularly called, began on April 7, 2005.        
	There were some misconceptions after which we approached the ministry of external affairs to clarify who is eligible for travel. Now it is clear that it is not residents of Jammu and Kashmir alone who can apply. Any Indian can do so even if he is not from the state, Manavalan said.        
	Sources in the passport office said no one who was not a member of a divided family could board the bus for the 185km journey since the service opened. Travel across the LoC was banned when the state was partitioned in 1947.        
	Some people had insisted that no such restrictions exist under law. We wanted to resolve the issue once and for all. The ministry clarified the issue recently, said an official.        
	The regional passport officer said the only condition now for a visit to Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, was two references from people on the other side that they knew the person applying for the permit.        
	They (the applicants) need not necessarily be members of divided families or related to people on the other side, Manavalan said.         
	Official sources said around 5,000 people had so far taken the peace bus to PoK but the passport office had not yet received an application from someone unrelated to a divided family. It could be that the issue has not been properly publicised, Manavalan said.        
	People taking the bus dont need a passport. All they need is a permit issued by the passport office in Kashmir.

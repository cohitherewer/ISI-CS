The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Autonomy hint for IIMs
                                                                                                               Autonomy hint for IIMs
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 22: HRD minister Kapil Sibal has for the first time signalled his intention to get the government to disengage from IIMs, giving them full control over their fees, salaries and international academic connections.         
	In a dramatic shift from existing policy, Sibal today said he planned to gradually withdraw his ministrys control over the premier B-schools.         
	Sibal said he would give the IIMs a five-year period to prove their ability to run themselves with reduced government intervention, granting the autonomy they have long hankered for.         
	The minister said he had already called a meeting with the directors of the seven IIMs  in Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Calcutta, Lucknow, Indore, Kozhikode and Shillong  to discuss his plan for government withdrawal.         
	I see no reason why the IIMs should not have more control over themselves, Sibal said in response to a query from this reporter on why IIMs capable of financing themselves werent allowed greater autonomy in determining faculty salaries.         
	Sibal said the ministry and the directors could together prepare a blueprint laying down stage-by-stage requirements the IIMs would need to fulfil for the government to take steps towards withdrawal from governance. At each stage, we will see. If the IIMs meet their end (side) of the requirements, we will incrementally withdraw, Sibal said. The relations between the IIMs and the government are based on the memoranda of agreement (MoA) that lay down the control that Centre has over the B-schools.        
	Ministry sources confirmed that Sibal had asked them to examine amending the MoAs to allow greater freedom. But it is still too early to say exactly what kind of amendments we may make, an official said.         
	Under the MoAs, the IIMs require the governments approval before they hike basic salaries of their faculty, set up fresh campuses  especially abroad  and collaborate with foreign institutions.         
	The board of governors of each IIM is technically empowered to set the fees for that institute. But the ministry has senior representatives on all such boards who use their presence to pressurise the IIMs against raising fees.        
	Sibals plans represent a massive shift from government policy since the IIMs were set up. The policy led to frequent spats over autonomy demands from self-sufficient IIMs in Ahmedabad, Bangalore and Calcutta. The other IIMs still depend on government funds.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 11: At least 700 inmates of Jharpada Special Jail have gone on hunger strike following demolition of places of worship inside the prison premises that started yesterday.        
	According to sources, inmates of the jail have been hatching conspiracies to escape or involve in activities threatening prison security at the temple and mosque. The murder of jail warden Manas Nayak last month was also plotted at the prison.         
	The demolition drive is aimed at stemming criminal activities inside jails, inspector-general of police (prison) V. Thyagrajan said. The structures have been blocking the view inside the jail making it difficult for the security staff to monitor movement of inmates inside the prison, he reasoned. He added that the intention was not to hurt religious sentiments.        
	At Jharpada jail, the drive ended today, but the hunger strike  started during dinner yesterday  is still on.                     
	Demolition of religious structures would also be executed at other jails in the state, said a police officer.

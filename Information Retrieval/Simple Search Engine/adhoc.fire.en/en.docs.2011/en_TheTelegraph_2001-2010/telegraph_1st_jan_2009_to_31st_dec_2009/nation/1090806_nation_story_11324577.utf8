                                                                                                               Plea for more central aid in school scheme
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              Naveen, (below) Sibal				                                 
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 5: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik today demanded increase in central share in Sarva Siksha Abhiyan to 75 per cent from 50 per cent.        
	The demand was placed during his meeting with Union human resource development minister Kapil Sibal in New Delhi this morning.        
	After the passage of the Right to Education Bill in Parliament, the Centre should come forward to assist the states in a big way to realise the goal of education for all children. The Centre should increase its share in Sarva Siksha Abhiyan from existing 50 per cent to 75 per cent, Naveen told reporters here this afternoon after returning from New Delhi.        
	Naveen said that he had requested Sibal to start construction of hostel buildings for all model schools, engineering and medical colleges and also at the central university being set up in Koraput. Sibal assured to consider the request very seriously.        
	Sibal also assured Naveen of expediting establishment of a world-class university, sanctioned by the Centre, in Bhubaneswar.        
	Last evening, Naveen met Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar and sought an allocation of Rs 100 crore for farm mechanisation. He also demanded inclusion of six more districts under the National Horticulture Mission. Pawar agreed to include three districts. He also requested Pawar to set up the National Fisheries Mission in Orissa and the minister assured to consider the proposal with due importance.        
	During his meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh yesterday, Naveen strongly objected to the declaration of Polavaram irrigation project being built by the Andhra Pradesh government on Orissa border as a national project and sought Singhs intervention. Naveen urged Singh to issue instructions for stopping construction of the disputed project, as it would submerge a large number of tribal villages in Orissa.         
	No public hearing has been held by the Centre and the state government was not approached for any opinion, too, he alleged.        
	Naveen also took up the issue about refund of central assistance for the 2008 floods. As the state government has already incurred huge expenditure on flood relief and restoration measures, no refund of assistance be insisted by the Centre.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 16: Worried over the growing man-elephant conflict due to destruction of habitat, the state government has decided to draw up a corridor management plan for tuskers.        
	An estimated Rs 54 crore will be spent on the implementation of the plan, which is expected to be ready within six months, a senior forest department official said.        
	Nine corridors have been identified to provide free passage to the elephants to move in the forests, said the official.         
	These corridors are Kare-Karampada, Badampahar-Dhobadhobani, Badamapahar-Karidapurba, Similipal-Hadagarh, Hadagarh-Kuladiha, Kanheijena-Anantpur, Tala-Kholagarha, Nuagaon-Baruni and Kotagarh-Chandrapur.        
	The need for a well-managed elephant corridor was felt in view of the growing man-elephant conflict. There are reports of wild pachyderms straying into human habitations due to shrinkage of habitat caused by urbanisation as well as industrialisation, resulting in loss of human lives and property. A compensation of Rs 8.92 crore has been paid by the state government during the past nine years for the loss of property and human lives, sources said.        
	The wild elephants, in turn, are also killed by angry mobs following human deaths.        
	The pachyderms also fall prey to poachers. The state government has, therefore, constituted 48 squads in 36 wildlife and forest divisions across the state to prevent elephant casualty.        
	Electrocution of elephants in large numbers has also been reported. Expressing concern, chief minister Naveen Patnaik directed the forest and wildlife officials to take preventive measures in co-ordination with the energy department.        
	In this context, the elephant corridor management plan is being drawn up to save the jumbos and their habitat from human onslaught.         
	The plan also prevents depredation by the wild pachyderms.         
	In spite of the increasing elephant casualty because of mob attack and electrocution, there has been a silver lining. The states pachyderm population has gone up because of various conservation measures, claimed forest and wildlife officials. The elephant population has risen from 1,841 in 2002 to 1,862 in 2007, sources in the forest department said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Push to wrap up Kasab trial before polls
                                                                                                               Push to wrap up Kasab trial before polls
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              Nikam (top), Kazmi				                                 
	Mumbai, July 22: Ajmal Kasabs confession has given a push to the 26/11 case with the Maharashtra government today claiming the state was keen to wrap up the gunmans trial before the coming Assembly elections.        
	Maharashtra is scheduled to go to polls in October.        
	The government wants this trial to end before the elections for obvious reasons. Kasabs confession has come at the right time, it should not take long for the sentence, hopefully by early October, said a senior Maharashtra bureaucrat who did not wish to speak on record.        
	The Maharashtra government had come in for criticism when it took around 13 years to complete the trial into the 1993 Bombay blasts and sentence the accused. If it manages to secure a conviction for Kasab  who dramatically told the court today it could hang him  by October, the ruling Congress-NCP combine could reap mileage in the Assembly elections, which could be held around the time of the first anniversary of the November 26-28, 2008, attacks.         
	Last week, special court judge M.L. Tahilyani had remarked that he would like to complete the trial before Diwali, which falls around October 16-17.        
	The Maharashtra officials claim came even as special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam argued that the court should allow him to submit more evidence against the terrorist.        
	Kasab has not made a full disclosure about his role in the terror attacks in his statement to the court. We want to establish why Mumbai was targeted, why foreigners were attacked and to expose the infrastructure and operations and conspiracy of the Lashkar-e-Toiba, he said.        
	Nikam said if granted permission by the court, he could complete the trial by August-end.        
	Kasabs lawyer, S.G. Abbas Kazmi, has been crying foul since the last two days over the timing of the admission of guilt, indicating a greater conspiracy behind his clients act.        
	But today, Kazmi was left stumped when Kasab outright rejected his allegation that the admission was the result of mental torture of the gunman by policemen guarding him.        
	Judge Tahilyani asked Kasab if this was true.        
	The Pakistani cast a perplexed glance at his lawyer and replied: Nahin toh (Not at all)!        
	I was neither tortured nor put under any pressure. What my lawyer is saying was told to me many days ago, right after my arrest, by some policemen. Nothing of this sort has happened now, Kasab added.        
	More drama was to follow.        
	Nikam reiterated his argument that the admission was a ploy to get a lenient sentence or save handlers in Pakistan.        
	Kasab scoffed at the allegation. Agar kisiko aitraaz haiagar kisi ke dil mein shak hai ki main phansi se bachne ke liye yeh kar raha hoon toh beshak phansi ki saza dijiye. (If anyone feels that I am confessing to escape the death penalty, then the court may without doubt hang me), he told the judge.

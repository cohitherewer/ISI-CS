The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bed rest, with inaugurations for breakfast 
                                                                                                               Bed rest, with inaugurations for breakfast 
          G.C. SHEKHAR                                            
	Chennai, Feb. 22: At 85, M. Karunanidhi may have set a world record  for inaugurating the highest number of projects from a hospital bed.        
	The chief minister has been happily pushing buttons, unveiling projects through videoconferencing and launching into speeches while recovering from spinal surgery at Sri Ramachandra Hospital, surrounded by doctors and family.        
	In the past one week alone, he has opened a grade separator built by the National Highways Authority in Chennai, a hospital in Union home minister P. Chidambarams constituency Sivaganga and a river-linking project in Tirunelveli.        
	Today, he made a mobile call to Union communications minister A. Raja, which was relayed through speakers at the Chennai telephone exchange, to kick off telecom major BSNLs 3G services. True to style, he made a speech as well.        
	Karunanidhi has also threatened an indefinite fast in hospital unless the states lawyers, agitating against a police baton-charge on the high court premises, agree to resolve the crisis that has closed all state courts.        
	His demonstration that ill need not mean indisposed comes at a time Kerala chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan is believed to be considering sick leave in hospital to skip a CPM function.        
	There is, however, sound political logic behind Karunanidhis hectic hospital schedule. Once elections are announced, the model code of conduct will bar inaugurations. The chief minister, therefore, has told officials and his partys Union ministers to line up all possible inaugurations and foundation-stone programmes before March 2.        
	He cannot be finding his job too unpleasant. The DMK stalwart has never fought shy of inaugurations or felicitations despite lower-back pain pinning him to a wheelchair for the past year. He would often sit for over three hours at such programmes, thus aggravating his backache and necessitating the February 11 surgery to relieve a compressed disc.        
	A senior minister denied that Karunanidhi wanted to hog the limelight in spite of his ailment. This merely shows our leader is active even from a hospital bed. Its we who are badgering him out of eagerness to see his name recorded for posterity, linked with all major projects.        
	Working from sickbed is not new to Tamil Nadus politicians. Karunanidhis great rival, M.G. Ramachandran, had won the 1984 Assembly polls from a New York hospital after a kidney transplant.        
	Since doctors have advised Karunanidhi to avoid travel, he may take the videoconference route even to campaign rallies. He might share the dais with Sonia Gandhi at one or two rallies, though, sources said.        
	His threat of a fast came after lawyers announced a hunger strike on Monday demanding central forces in the high court complex. The court also issued a notice to the police asking who had ordered the baton-charge.        
	Let bygones be bygones. I urge the lawyers not to fall prey to certain political parties, Karunanidhi said.

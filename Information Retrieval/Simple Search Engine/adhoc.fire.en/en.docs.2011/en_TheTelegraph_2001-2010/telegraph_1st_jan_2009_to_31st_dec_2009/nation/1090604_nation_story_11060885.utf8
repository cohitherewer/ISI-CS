The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ragging fine to drop off 
                                                                                                               Ragging fine to drop off 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, June 3: The Centre is dropping a key financial deterrent against ragging from a planned set of rules against the banned offence.         
	The human resource development ministry has asked the University Grants Commission to drop from its proposed new rules a Rs 2.5-lakh fine  up from Rs 2,500 initially proposed  for those found guilty of the offence, The Telegraph has learnt.        
	The turnaround follows the specific introduction of the hefty fine by those drafting the regulations, and comes on the eve of the formal notification of the new rules.         
	The UGC, the countrys apex regulator for higher education, is meeting tomorrow to finalise the regulations for notification. The commission is expected to accept the HRD ministrys request, instantly blunting the much-awaited regulations even before they are implemented, sources said.        
	The ministrys decision follows concerns raised by legal experts that the fine may not be tenable if challenged in court, the sources said.         
	The UGC act allows the commission to impose financial penalties on institutions it declares fake. As the act does not specifically mention a fine for any other offence, imposing a financial penalty for ragging may prove troublesome legally, ministry sources said.         
	Laws passed by Parliament are deemed superior to regulations drafted by the UGC since these are implemented not by law-enforcement agencies but by a regulatory authority.         
	But the ministrys justification for dropping the planned fine has prompted questions from some of those who have helped draft the regulations. Draft regulations first prepared by a group of experts at the UGC had mentioned a fine of up to Rs 2,500.         
	The draft were posted on the Internet for comments and discussed with other regulatory bodies in the area of education, such as the Medical Council of India.        
	Based on the feedback, the UGC and the ministry finalised the regulations, including the Rs 2.5-lakh penalty, and released these last week. The 100-fold increase was projected as proof of the Centres keenness to stringently implement the Supreme Court directives against ragging.         
	The draft regulations were legally scrutinised before they were released to the media. How did it escape that scrutiny? questioned a senior official involved in the drafting.

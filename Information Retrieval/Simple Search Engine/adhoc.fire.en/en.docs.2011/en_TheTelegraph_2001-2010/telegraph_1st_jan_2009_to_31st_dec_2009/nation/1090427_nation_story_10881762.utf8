          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Srinagar, April 26: A Jammu businessman has shelled out Rs 85,000 for a car registration number of his choice. Its AK 47.         
	The Jammu regional transport office said Mohammad Rafiq Mirs bid for AK 47, a Russian assault rifle that is a favourite with militants in Kashmir, was the highest in the state for a vanity number.         
	Numbers like 5555, which are easily recognisable and easy to remember, are called vanity numbers.        
	This is not a vanity number that people normally look for. But there were enquiries and five persons finally came forward to participate in the bidding, a transport official said.         
	Mir, who has bought a new Honda City for Rs 11 lakh, said the bidding amount was not a concern.         
	I was ready to pay more and am happy I got this registration number. The reason is obvious, said Mir, who hails from Bathinda in Jammu.         
	His car number will read JK 02 AK 47.         
	The number AK 56  another assault rifle that militants use  has sold for Rs 29,000.         
	Vanity numbers always have many bidders, sources at the regional transport office said.         
	People also ask for the number 786, or a zero prefix or suffixed to it, one officer said. Muslims consider the number an auspicious one.

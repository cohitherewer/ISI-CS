	Raipur, April 25: The Chhattisgarh government today extended the ban on the Communist Party of India (Maoist) and six of its frontal organisations for another year following its unlawful activities in the state.        
	The ban has been imposed under sub-section 1 of Section 3 of the Chhattisgarh Special Public Security Act, a senior official with the home department said.        
	The department issued the notification to this effect this afternoon, extending the ban on the CPI (Maoist) and its six frontal organisations till April 12, 2010.         
	The frontal organisations include the Dandakaranya Adivasi Kisan Mazdoor Sangh, Krantikari Adivasi Mahila Sangh, Krantikari Adivasi Balak Sangh, Krantikari Kisan Committee, Mahila Mukti Manch and Jantana Sarkar.        
	Chhattisgarh, which like Jharkhand, is a hotbed of ultra-Left extremism, had banned the CPI(Maoist) and affiliated organisations for the first time in April 2006. Since then, the state government has been extending the period.        
	All the five districts of Bastar  Dantewada, Bijapur, Bastar, Kanker and Narayanpur  are rebel infested.         
	According to police sources, more than 1,500 people have lost their lives in violence unleashed by rebels in the state since it was created in November 2000.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 14: The government today said it had no plans to bring a new amnesty scheme for tax evaders but would amend the Indo-Mauritius tax treaty to curb its misuse by companies.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, who made the announcements in the Lok Sabha, also said the UPA government was committed to unearthing black money within and outside the country. A dialogue has been started with Swiss authorities to get information on black money stashed in that countrys banks, he added.        
	A National Institute of Public Finance and Policy study in 1985 had estimated black money between Rs 31,584 crore and Rs 36,786 crore in 1983-84.         
	We are not enamoured by (suggestions for) another voluntary disclosure system (VDS), Mukherjee said. Such disclosure schemes in the past offered amnesty to people who declared black money and paid tax.        
	The amnesty schemes have been criticised on the ground that they amount to penalising honest tax payers by asking them to pay higher rates.        
	Mukherjee said the government was trying to have the Mauritius tax treaty of 1980 amended to check the practice of companies evading paying taxes both in India and Mauritius. Under this pact, offshore firms based in Mauritius, including some FIIs operating in India, dont pay tax on capital gains.         
	Efforts are on to revise double-tax avoidance agreements, such as those with Mauritius and Switzerland, to plug loopholes, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Assembly panel for strict mines monitor
                                                                                                               Assembly panel for strict mines monitor
          SUBRAT DAS                          Legal steps?                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 24: The Assembly standing committee relating to steel and mines department has recommended for strengthening enforcement mechanism to prevent illegal mining and transportation of minerals.        
	Strengthening of the enforcement mechanism and mineral administration and establishment of check gates is very much essential to curb illegal mining and transportation of minerals, observed the committee, headed by senior BJD legislator Usha Devi.        
	An ad hoc provision of Rs 20 lakh in the supplementary budget was recommended by the standing committee for it.        
	Under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulations) Act and the relevant rules, the state government is required to set up check gates for monitoring minerals under transit and install weighbridges to measure the quantity of minerals being transported.        
	However, the CAG report for 2007-08 had revealed that there were no check gates in six out of eight circles covered by the audit and no government weighbridges in four circles. The state government, in its reply, had informed the CAG that steps were being taken to install more weighbridges and check gates, but it was not implemented.        
	The Assembly committee also found that the enforcement mechanism of the department was woefully inadequate as evident from the fact that at least 323 posts out of total sanctioned strength of 1,453 were lying vacant in the department. It recommended that the vacancies be filled up immediately.        
	The recommendations assume significance in the wake of detection of large-scale illegal mining in Keonjhar district by the vigilance bureau leading to recent arrest of eight officials and mines operators.        
	A preliminary vigilance report, which was submitted to the state government on August 7, revealed that illegal mining was going on in Keonjhar district in connivance with officials of the mines and forest departments.        
	A private firm, which was liquidated long ago, was allowed to guard the manganese mine area by the directorate of mines by violating norms, revealed the report. The vigilance team found evidence of illegal mining activities by the firm without forest or pollution clearance, it said.        
	Criminal cases were registered against seven mines and forest department officials who had allegedly encouraged such illegal activities. A mines operator and the officials were also arrested.        
	Even mines director R.N. Sahoo came under vigilance scanner as one of the prime witnesses in the alleged multi-crore mining scam.        
	Vigilance inquiry had been ordered by chief minister Naveen Patnaik after the alleged scam rocked the Assembly.

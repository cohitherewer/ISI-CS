The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Gadkari spoiler in Sangh plan
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Gadkari spoiler in Sangh plan
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 19: One of the first effects of Nitin Gadkaris appointment as BJP president may be to force his principal backer to abandon a key blueprint.        
	Gadkaris desire for a Rajya Sabha berth may handicap the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, which wants a clear separation between the BJPs parliamentary wing and the party organisation.        
	The Sangh, which scripted Gadkaris elevation to tighten its grip on the BJP, believes that top party posts, especially those of general secretary, should be withheld from MPs so that the organisation is not neglected.        
	The proposal had put a question mark on the continuance of three MPs who double as general secretaries: Ananth Kumar, Gopinath Munde and Vinay Katiyar.        
	Three vice-presidents  Bal Apte, Shanta Kumar and Bijoya Chakravarty  too are MPs, but since a vice-presidents post is not as important as a general secretarys, they might have kept their party jobs even if the Sangh implemented its plan.        
	However, an official said that if Gadkari got a Rajya Sabha seat from Maharashtra in the April elections, the plan may have to be junked.        
	The Sangh-BJP has emulated the Congress by amending the BJP constitution to create the parliamentary party chairmans position for L.K. Advani after he resigned as leader of the Lok Sabha Opposition.        
	The Congress parliamentary party chairpersons post was similarly set up for Sonia Gandhi in 1998 because she was not an MP. However, once she was into full-time politics, the Congress felt she should play an active part in the partys parliamentary arm.        
	But while the Congress tweaked the rules to bridge the party-parliamentary wing divide for Sonia, the Sanghs rationale was to separate the two so it could reign supreme over the party and let Advani, Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley run parliamentary affairs.        
	Minutes after Gadkaris appointment, his picture replaced Rajnath Singhs on the BJPs portal and was positioned with the faces of Advani and Atal Bihari Vajpayee.        
	With that, lobbying started for the positions that have fallen vacant. The deputy Opposition leaders post in the Lok Sabha is likely to go to Gopinath Munde although Ananth Kumar and Yashwant Sinha too are keen. But since Gadkari, Sushma and Jaitley are all Brahmins, the BJP is unlikely to induct a fourth Brahmin, Ananth.

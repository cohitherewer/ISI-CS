The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Jet luggage strike hits four city flights
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Jet luggage strike hits four city flights
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 5: A section of Jet Airways luggage handlers at Dum Dum airport went on a flash strike today demanding higher daily pay and manhandled a senior official while he was disbursing wages, affecting at least four flights.        
	Out of the 450 workers, 300 joined work after negotiations, while 150 did not relent till tonight.        
	Asked whether flights will be affected on Sunday, a Jet spokesperson said: We are hopeful all the handlers will join work tomorrow.        
	Police have started a probe based on an FIR lodged by the airline against four workers who allegedly assaulted general manager Sambuddha Gupta.        
	The incident took place around 4.45pm when Gupta was disbursing money to the labourers at his office. Some of the agitating members barged inside and allegedly manhandled him, said a police officer. Gupta was later admitted to a hospital with chest pain.        
	The trouble started around 11 in the morning when some 450 cargo handling staff of the airline, all contract labourers, went on strike demanding a daily wage of Rs 203 as recommended by the Central Labour Commission.        
	Jet authorities tried to convince the agitators that the recommendation was not for the aviation sector. After hours of negotiation, 300 labourers, loyal to CPM-backed union Citu, joined work. But the remaining 150 refused to budge.        
	In the middle of the agitation, while I was disbursing the daily wages from my office, a group of agitating labourers barged in and ransacked my office. They threw away files from the table and pushed me, said Gupta.        
	Insiders said the group owed allegiance to the newly formed Trinamul Congress-backed Jet Airways Contractual Labourers Union.        
	This is not true, said Nitai Ghosh, a union leader. We have boycotted the wages but our union members have not ransacked any office or created any disruption. Mamata Banerjee has asked us not to act irresponsibly.        
	Sources said there were four slabs for the daily pay and the 150 workers got the least  Rs 4,500 a month (26 days). A daily wage of Rs 203 would mean a little over Rs 5,200 a month.

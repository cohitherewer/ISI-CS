The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | 26/11 cop points out Kasab
                                                                                                               26/11 cop points out Kasab
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, May 8: A sub-inspector, the first prosecution witness in the Mumbai attacks, today recounted how his mostly baton-wielding colleagues had caught an AK47-firing Ajmal Kasab and lost an unarmed officer.        
	Sub-inspector Bhaskar Kadam told the special court that Kasab, pretending to be injured while fellow-gunman Ismail Khan was wounded after their car was intercepted, had sprayed bullets at sub-inspector Tukaram Oomble on November 26 night. The duo were racing away after the attack at CST station.        
	Both Ismail and Oomble were declared dead in hospital.         
	Kasab displayed no emotion when Kadam pointed him out today. Kadam and assistant inspector Sanjay Govilkar are among the 106 witnesses set to depose during the trial.        
	The defence disputed evidence like Oombles post-mortem report. Special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam said this was done to delay and derail the trial, a tactic also used in the 1993 blasts case.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Minority school board plea on Sibal table
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Minority school board plea on Sibal table
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           Kapil Sibal                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 25: Muslim MPs have asked human resource development minister Kapil Sibal to carve out a separate board for all minority-run schools  a potentially controversial suggestion to create the countrys first religion-based school board.         
	MPs opposed to a proposed board for mainstreaming madarsa education have asked the minister for a separate agency to affiliate minority schools and provide them financial support, The Telegraph has learnt.         
	The demand was conveyed to Sibal at two meetings he held last week with some Muslim MPs who had earlier rejected a bill to create the proposed Central Madarsa Board (CMB), sources said.        
	The idea was most forcefully proposed by Mahmood Madani, leader of the Jamiat-Ulama-i-Hind, and a Rashtriya Lok Dal MP in the Rajya Sabha, the sources said.         
	Although the ministry is uneasy about the proposal from the MPs, it has not rejected the suggestion.         
	The ministry is hoping the suggestion will provide the seed for a consensus on a mechanism to help madarsa students enter formal higher education.        
	Most universities, including those run by the government, do not admit madarsa students directly because of an absence of any quality standardisation of education in Islamic seminaries.         
	The meetings with the MPs follows a letter written by Sibal to the legislators opposed to the proposed madarsa board, urging them to suggest alternatives to help students in the seminaries.        
	Earlier this year, when Sibal had met the Muslim MPs, many of them had opposed the bill outright. At that meeting, Sibal had suggested that the MPs send written comments, suggesting how they wanted the bill altered to accommodate their concerns. But none of them wrote back.        
	The new proposal from the MPs, although controversial, suggests that the parliamentarians are veering towards accepting the need for a special board for schools run by the community, the sources said.        
	Although the proposal from the MPs appears focused on a separate board for mainstream minority-run schools, the ministry hopes to convince the parliamentarians that madarsas must be covered by the new board.         
	We appear to be slowly limping towards a consensus on a madarsa board, an official said.         
	The Muslim MPs proposal argues that existing boards, like the Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE), do not grant affiliation easily to schools run by members of their community.         
	They have also argued that minority-run schools, even mainstream institutions, need government financial support. A separate board for minority-run schools, they felt, will make affiliation easier The board, the MPs argued, could have a dedicated fund to assist minority-run schools financially.         
	The madarsa board bill already includes a dedicated fund to financially assist institutions with grants. But the bill covers only madarsas and not mainstream minority-run schools.        
	A conference of Deoband clerics had last month passed a resolution demanding a board for minority-run schools.         
	But this is the first occasion that the suggestion has been formally communicated to the ministry as an alternative to the governments proposal for a madarsa board to maintain minimum quality standards at the affiliated seminaries.

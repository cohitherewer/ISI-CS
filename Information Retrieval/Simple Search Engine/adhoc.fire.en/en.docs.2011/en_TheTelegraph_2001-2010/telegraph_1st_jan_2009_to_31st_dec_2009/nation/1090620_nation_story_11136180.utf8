          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	Bhopal, June 19: Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan today suspended IAS officer Gyaneshwar Patil, who was caught on camera with his pants down in the presence of a young man.        
	Twenty-three-year-old Satish Chaukse, the secretary of a village panchayat, has accused Patil of sexually harassing him. The IAS officer, 32, is serving as chief executive officer of the Bhopal district panchayat.         
	In the panchayat set-up, Chaukse is among some 130 people working under Patil.        
	Bhopal police have so far refused to register a case against Patil, reasoning that no crime had been committed. Speaking informally, investigation officers said since no unnatural act was performed, they were unable to register any case.        
	Chauhan has, however, ordered the officers suspension pending inquiry into allegations levelled by Chaukse on television.         
	Around 9.30 last night, well past office working hours, Patil found himself in an awkward position in the office toilet with Chaukse.         
	Television footage with local channels, which somehow reached the spot, showed a red-faced Patil rushing out of a toilet adjacent to his office, followed by the alleged victim, both in identical states of undress.        
	The cameras rolling, Chaukse began accusing Patil of having sexually harassed him for a considerable time. He used to harass me for a long time. Today he called me at an odd hour despite my refusal. I had to come because I was afraid of losing my job, alleged Chaukse.         
	Patil, a 2003 batch officer, rebutted the allegations. This is a conspiracy against me. Calling the media is a part of plotting against me, the officer said.        
	The IAS officers wife said she was not ready to believe that her husband was indulging in any unbecoming behaviour. Within the bureaucracy, Patil is considered to be straightforward and efficient.         
	The officer accused Chaukse of trying to blackmail him. I was in the office till late last night and when I entered the bathroom, Chaukse, who was already there, started screaming after taking off his shirt. I rushed out of the bathroom where some cameramen suddenly appeared and started clicking photographs, Patil said.        
	Jaideep Prasad, the Bhopal superintendent of police, said a case would be registered only after verifying the complaints by Chaukse and Patil as both had levelled allegations against each other.

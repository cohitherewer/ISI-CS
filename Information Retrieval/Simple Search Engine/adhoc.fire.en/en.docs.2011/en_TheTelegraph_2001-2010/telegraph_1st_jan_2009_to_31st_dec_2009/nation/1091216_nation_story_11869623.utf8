          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 15: Mamata Banerjee today asserted that land would not be taken forcibly for the dedicated freight corridors and multiple options were on the table to procure plots for other rail projects.        
	We will not take land forcefully for the dedicated freight corridor. We would negotiate and amicably settle the issue.what (is the problem) if there is a delay of four to six months, the railway minister said during a debate on demands for supplementary grants in the Lok Sabha.        
	Two freight corridors are planned, one from Punjabs Ludhiana to Dankuni near Calcutta and the other from Delhi to Mumbai. Mamata said 21,500 acres would be required for the corridors.        
	The minister didnt explain what the other multiple options would be, except saying the aim would be to cause least hardship to people while acquiring land for projects.        
	Mamatas Trinamul Congress was blamed for having forced the Tatas to shift their Nano plant to Gujarat by launching an agitation against land acquisition for the project.        
	The House passed the Rs 731-crore supplementary demands for 2009-10. The money is meant for plans identified as National Projects and for some other works.        
	The minister said she would soon come out with a white paper on the health of the railways with the objective of improving efficiency.         
	The document is likely to address claims that the railways generated a surplus of Rs 90,000 crore during the tenure of Lalu Prasad, Mamatas predecessor in the ministry, without naming the Bihar leader.         
	We will bring a white paper on the health of the organisation which will not target any individual. This is purely an effort to improve the efficiency of the railways, she said.

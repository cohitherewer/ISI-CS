                                                                                                               Rahul woos poor

	April 21: As the helicopter droned into view, the crowd, old and young, rose to their feet at Pipariya in Madhya Pradesh.        
	By the time the dust had settled down, the focus had shifted from the whirling rotors to the poor man.         
	Nine times in his 11-minute speech, Rahul Gandhi mentioned the words as he dwelt on what his party has done for the aam aadmi. Unlike the NDA, the Congress has been with the poor, the Dalits and the Adivasis, he said as the crowd cheered.         
	When he took the stage, Rahul had thanked the crowd for waiting for him in 43-degree heat, under a blazing midday sun.        
	The young Gandhi also tore into L.K. Advani and the BJP for calling Manmohan Singh weak, but the stress was on the common man. He spoke at length about the rural employment guarantee scheme and said it was the best of its kind in the world.         
	The BJP ran the India shinning campaign. We wont say that until poverty is banished and the last poor in the country are taken care of, wherever they are and whichever religion they belong to, he added.         
	He knows the reality of India, said retired armyman R. Upadhyaya, who was at the ground. He can make a difference. Perhaps aware of the Congresss state of affairs in Madhya Pradesh, the 80-year-old said Rahul had done his job. The rest is in the hands of God, he added, leaning on his walking stick.

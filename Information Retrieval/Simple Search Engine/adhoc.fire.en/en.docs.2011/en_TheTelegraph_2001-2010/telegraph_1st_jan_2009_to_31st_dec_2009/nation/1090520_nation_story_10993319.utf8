The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hindutva question confronts BJP
                                                                                                               Hindutva question confronts BJP
          SANJAY K. JHA                          Varun Gandhi at a programme to celebrate his victory in Pilibhit. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, May 19: The BJP largely believes the Congress owes its poll success to situational advantages in states but some leaders have raised ideological questions relating to the efficacy of Hindutva.        
	The standard argument in BJP circles is that the Congress gained in Bengal and Kerala because the Left was decimated; it retained its clout in Andhra because the people did not trust the third front; and it pocketed Rajasthan and Delhi as a bonus after the Assembly poll win.        
	These are all state-specific reasons. Add to this Uttarakhand, where we paid for intra-party fights, and Haryana, where .P. Chautala is very unpopular. That more or less explains the huge gap between us and the Congress, a BJP leader said.        
	The party feels some losses in Madhya Pradesh were caused by anti-incumbency against sitting MPs and that Orissa was a lost case after the BJD walkout.        
	Such an analysis has convinced leaders there is no reason to believe national voters have rejected the BJP. They say the party has done well in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Gujarat, Bihar and Himachal, and assert that the Congress gained mainly at the cost of the third front, not the BJP.        
	But one section has dismissed such reasoning as sophistry. It has questioned why Uttar Pradesh voters, disenchanted with the Samajwadi Party and Mayavatis BSP, preferred the Congress to the BJP.        
	This section has pointed out that despite the Congresss weak organisational machinery, it reaped a big harvest because of a major Muslim vote shift. Some said the BJP would have to probe if this was triggered by the Varun Gandhi effect.        
	The Muslims have definitely moved towards the Congress as indicated by Lalu Prasads rout too. We have to decide whether to pursue aggressive Hindutva or focus exclusively on good governance, a leader said.        
	The RSS, which worked whole-heartedly for the BJP in this election, will also have to debate this issue.        
	Many younger BJP leaders have questioned the duplicity of the top leadership. One said: Most senior leaders hail Modi. But they denounce Varun Gandhi. Is it because Varun has no powers and they are scared of the powerful Modi?        
	He added the BJP leadership would have to understand that Varun was just a small consequence of the Modi phenomenon. Even L.K. Advani and Arun Jaitley, who talked about good governance, have avoided criticising Modi.        
	There has been another dichotomy. Senior leaders tried to exploit the Amarnath agitation to the hilt; in northeast Delhi, they fielded B.L. Sharma Prem who asked Muslims to go to Pakistan; and in Orissa, they gave a ticket to the prime Kandhamal riot suspect.        
	Alongside this, Advanis loyalists wove a moderate campaign on the Net assuming the dichotomy would not be obvious to the average eye. But the Varun episode ripped the veneer and Muslims responded with a vengeance.

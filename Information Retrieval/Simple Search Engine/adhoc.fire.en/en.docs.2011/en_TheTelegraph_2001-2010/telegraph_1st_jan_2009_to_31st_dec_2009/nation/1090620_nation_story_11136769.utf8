	Mumbai, June 19: A Kandahar-bound transport plane leased to the US military and apparently carrying defence cargo was forced to land in Mumbai tonight after it entered Indian airspace without permission.        
	The AN 124, a huge carrier almost always used by military to haul cargo, entered the Jamnagar area when it was spotted on the Bhuj radar around 9pm on Friday.        
	The plane, owned by a Ukraine-based logistics and cargo company, was flying from Diego Garcia, the US base, to Afghanistan. The plane has a five-member American crew, who were being questioned in Mumbai late tonight.        
	The aircraft had taken permission for unscheduled entry from the directorate general of civil aviation but it did not have air defence control clearance. Both are needed for foreign planes.        
	A third approval from the Indian Air Force is also needed if a foreign plane is carrying military equipment. Mumbai airport sources said the AN 124 was carrying military vehicles and ammunition. America and its allies are now locked in a battle with the Taliban in Afghanistan.        
	The plane headed towards Karachi, then turned and entered Indian airspace. The pilot said the plane was low on fuel, but he was asked to head to Mumbai because of the size of the aircraft.        
	Sources described as untrue reports that the plane was escorted by Indian Air Force jets.        
	During the Gulf War, India had allowed planes of the US-led allied forces to refuel in Mumbai.

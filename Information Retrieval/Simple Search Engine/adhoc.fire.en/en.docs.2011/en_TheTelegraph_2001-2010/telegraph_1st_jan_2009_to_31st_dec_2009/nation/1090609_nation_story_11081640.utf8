The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Budget session starts on cautionary note
                                                                                                               Budget session starts on cautionary note
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	Bhubaneswar, June 8: Governor M.C. Bhandare today stressed on the need to augment the states resources and the rationalisation of expenditure, in view of the declining revenue collection and global recession.        
	Delivering his address in the Assembly on the opening day of the budget session, Bhandare expressed apprehension regarding the states efforts to raise resources. He said that the efforts were likely to be adversely affected by the recession. The impact is already being felt in the declining collection of taxes, (non-tax) revenue and reduced amount of share in central taxes in April.        
	While the Presidents address to the Parliament unfolded the UPAs 100-day programme, the governors speech to the newly constituted Assembly lacked such an action plan. The governor only repeated some of the thrust areas such as irrigation, agriculture and industrialisation that also figured in his last years address.        
	Bhandare presented a rosy picture of the law and order situation here. Situation in Kandhamal that experienced communal riots in August 2008 is peaceful now. Police and central paramilitary forces are keeping a strict vigil, he said.        
	Neither did he touch on the issue of growing Maoist menace and how to counter the rebels, mentioning only the government decision to establish 95 new police stations and five marine police stations. Bhandare claimed that the manpower of 83 Naxalite-hit police stations have been augmented substantially.        
	Despite claims, fact remains that as many as 17 districts of the total 30 are now affected by Naxalite violence, according to government records.        
	Last nights Naxalite attack on a Baipariguda police station in Koraput district, recent Maoist operation at Nalcos bauxite mines at Damanjodi in the same district and the killing of tribals in Malkangiri by the rebels and in other districts are a pointer to this disturbing trend.        
	Coming back to the budget, the governor seemed satisfied with the success of the ongoing fiscal reform here. Achievements have been possible due to fiscal reforms carried out in the past nine years by the government, he said. Elaborating, he said, consistent debt stocks were stabilised and then reduced in a systematic manner as a result of the fiscal reforms.        
	The state has been in a position to reduce the debt stock from Rs 37,249.51 crore (2006-07) to Rs 36,311.61 crore by the end of 2007-08.        
	There is, however, no room for complacency, he warned, reiterating the governments commitment to fiscal prudence as a strategy for development.        
	Setting the goal for the government in the coming year, the governor said his government was keen to promote sustainable and inclusive growth and faster poverty reduction.

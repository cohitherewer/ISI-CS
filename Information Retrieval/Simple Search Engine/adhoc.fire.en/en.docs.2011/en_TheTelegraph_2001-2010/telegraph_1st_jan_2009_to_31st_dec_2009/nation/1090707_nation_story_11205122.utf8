The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cosmetic cut at Bollywood
                                                                                                               Cosmetic cut at Bollywood

	Calcutta, July 6: A googly at Bollywood.        
	By bringing in cosmetic and plastic surgery under the ambit of service tax, Pranab Mukherjee has made things costlier for stars and starlets who go under the scalpel every now and then to perfect or accentuate their features.        
	While not many have gone on record, everyone from Shilpa Shetty to Salman Khan to Minissha Lamba is said to have got nose and hair jobs done. Earlier, the stars would fly off to the West, but with the best of facilities and equipment now available in India, most of the surgeries take place here.        
	I know of plenty of actresses, experienced and upcoming, who have already gone or want to go for plastic surgeries. (But) I just want to tell them to think before taking the step because it can really backfire, actress Koena Mitra, whose nose job went completely wrong, said.        
	Cricket players and commentators, too, frequent the clinic for the physical add-ons.        
	City-based cosmetic surgeon Manoj Khanna, who made the Ravi Shastris and Harsha Bhogles look smarter on the tube, said: I dont think the service tax will have any effect at all (on the cosmetic surgery industry). Its a good thing because those who get such surgeries done can afford the extra tax fee. The money will add to the government corpus.

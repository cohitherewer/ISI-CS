	Patna, April 7: Lalu Prasad has done a Varun Gandhi in Bihar, two days after spouse Rabri Devi came under the Election Commissions scanner for her derogatory remarks against Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar.        
	Now, the RJD boss faces an arrest warrant for his words on BJPs Pilibhit nominee. The Kishenganj court of chief judicial magistrate today issued an arrest warrant against Lalu Prasad after police registered a case under the Peoples Representation Act and the IPC for his remarks on Varun Gandhi at a Kishenganj meeting yesterday.        
	Had I been the Union home minister I would have rolled a roller over Varun Gandhis chest without minding the consequences, the RJD boss was heard saying at the meeting in the constituency where 60 per cent of the population is Muslim.         
	RJDs Union minister Taslimuddin is seeking re-election on this seat on the Bihar-Bengal border.         
	The state BJP has now lodged a written complaint with the election commission demanding severest action against the RJD and its leadership, besides de-recognising the RJD and freezing its symbol.         
	The BJPs petition states: He (Lalu Prasad) has openly threatened to eliminate Varun Gandhi in presence of thousands and the media. His words have the potential to divide the society on communal lines and create a holocaust in areas such as Kishenganj, Katihar, Araria and Purnea.         
	Only two days ago his wife, a former chief minister, used abusive language against present chief minister Nitish Kumar, the petition reminds the EC.         
	Lalu Prasad has defended himself: I did not say that I would have got a roller rolled over Varuns chest. What I said was that had I been the home minister I would have got the roller of law over him. The RJD boss, however, said that as the saffron brigades approved candidate his party had little mercy for Varun Gandhi.         
	The superintendent of police Kishenganj H.N. Singh confirmed that the police would be forced to arrest Lalu Prasad, if he fails to surrender before the police. Lalu stands implicated under Section 125 of the Peoples Representation Act and Section 153 of the IPC for using provocative speech with an intention to foment riots.         
	In October 23, 1990, Lalu Prasad had turned a hero overnight among states Muslims by getting L.K. Advani arrested during his rath yatra in Samastipur for creating communal tension.        
	The Bihar strongman, prone to high-pitch rhetoric and demagoguery, is said to be whipping sentiments against Varun Gandhi  the saffron brigades latest poster boy  and consolidate Muslim votes.         
	However, chief minister Nitish Kumar has strongly reacted to Lalus words. Law will take its course against him, as Lalu Prasads speech at Kishenganj is abominable. The agencies involved in holding the polls should sternly deal with the campaigners delivering such inciting speeches.         
	He, however, made it a point to not spare Varun Gandhi either. There is little difference between Lalu Prasad and Varun Gandhi.

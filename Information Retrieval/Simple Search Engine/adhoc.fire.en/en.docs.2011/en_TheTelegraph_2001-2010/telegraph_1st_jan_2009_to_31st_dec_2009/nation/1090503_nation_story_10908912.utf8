The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cricket break in Cong hub, huddle in rivals
                                                                                                               Cricket break in Cong hub, huddle in rivals
  - Parties show contrasting faces          ANANYA SENGUPTA IN NEW DELHI                         The headquarters of the Congress (top) and the BJP in New Delhi. Pictures by Prem Singh				                                             
	Walk into the Congresss 24 Akbar Road office around 5.30pm, turn left towards a large lawn and youll see a cricket match under way  each run being lustily cheered by a motley crowd, each grassed catch booed.        
	Its the middle of poll season, and with top leaders busy in their constituencies and no high-level political drama coming out of the capital, AICC staffers and Congress-beat journalists are spending time playing cricket.        
	The generally buzzing office of the Congress, never free of hangers-on, wears a deserted look. Before campaigning began, it was next to impossible to get a parking slot in the area; now you can count the number of cars on your fingers.        
	The rooms of party general secretaries are all locked up. Its a job to trace even their personal assistants.        
	The Congress poll war room has shifted to 15 Rakabganj Road, so theres little activity at the headquarters. Lower level staff can be seen lounging in the corridors  theres little demand for tea and snacks, and they seem to be enjoying the break.        
	Even Janardhan Dwivedi, the chairperson of the Congress media room, is not to be seen. Sources say Dwivedi, who writes speeches for Sonia Gandhi, prefers to work from home.        
	The only time the office comes alive is between 4 and 5pm when a designated spokesperson briefs the media. After that, it goes back into slumber mode again.        
	Sources say party workers, who have part-time businesses, appear to be using their time well. Those dabbling in stocks keep themselves busy monitoring the market on the Internet; others keep tabs on the real estate mart.        
	Cut to the BJPs 11 Ashoka Road headquarters. At first sight you would think it was in snooze mode, too.        
	A shroud of silence overhangs the premises. There are rows and rows of fluttering BJP flags, cutouts of senior leaders are all over the place but theres not a soul to be seen. Even a store selling BJP campaign material is deserted, the shop-owners are missing.        
	Sources, however, say thats just the appearance. Walk in and you will spot some 20-25 people huddled in a room, frantically co-ordinating the BJP campaign.        
	The brains trust is at work at the 26 Tughlaq Crescent war room, but at the headquarters this group is busy all day  despatching campaign material, arranging transport for leaders and co-ordinating feedback from states.        
	Sources say work appears to be proceeding in a focused way since there is little disturbance by hangers-on. Besides, top leaders like L.K. Advani drop in at night, ensuring the workers are always on their toes.        
	But as in the Congress office, business is bad for the food stall owners and the tea-boys in the BJP hub, too.        
	Check out the Nationalist Congress Party office, and you will spot only gardeners and food stall owners there. A staffer naps in the womens wing office, on three strategically positioned chairs.        
	Jolted out of sleep, he grins and mumbles: Aankh lag gayi thi (Simply dozed off).

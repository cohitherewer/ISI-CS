          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 9: An experts panel has asked the Centre to create a ministry of internal security, carved out of the home ministry, to take care of the emerging security situation after 26/11.        
	A separate ministry, headed by a cabinet minister, is needed to tackle terrorism and Left-wing extremism, recommends the nine-member panel appointed by business chamber Ficci after the Mumbai attacks.        
	The panel is headed by industrialist and Independent Rajya Sabha member from Karnataka Rajeev Chandrasekhar. It includes former Intelligence Bureau director Ajit Doval, Lt Gen (retd) Satish Nambiar, former RAW additional secretary B. Raman and Air Chief Marshal (retd) S. Krishnaswamy.        
	A separate ministry will mean a separate budget, Doval said.        
	The report, handed to Union home minister P. Chidambaram today, throws into relief the roles of the ministers of state under him. Has there been a distribution of responsibilities? Chandrasekhar asked.        
	Junior home minister Ajay Maken is supposed to deal with Left-wing extremism, and his colleague Mullappally Ramachandran with insurgency in the Northeast.        
	Maken, however, has not visited any Maoist-hit state except Jharkhand while Ramachandran is yet to travel to any northeastern state. The ministers hardly ever accompany Chidambaram to any media conference.        
	The home ministry now has 18 divisions dealing with areas as diverse as the promotion of Hindi, Centre-state relations and freedom fighters pension. The generalist culture has gone so deep that (it is believed that) anyone has the skills to deal with anything, panel member and former bureaucrat Ved Marwah said.        
	The report recommends a separate department of physical security in the ministry, responsible for the protection of vital installations and VIPs.

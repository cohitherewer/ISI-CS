  - Suggestion to follow lunar calendar          CITHARA PAUL                          Devotees offer namaz on Id at the Jama Masjid in New Delhi on Monday. (Picture by Prem Singh)                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 21: Id-ul-Fitr may be celebrated the same day across the country from next year if there is agreement on modernising the moon-sighting procedure.        
	Id is now often celebrated at two or more dates in different parts of the country because of variations in the time at which the moon is visible.         
	This year, for instance, Kerala and certain parts of Tamil Nadu celebrated the festival yesterday, unlike other states that did so today.        
	Worried by the inconsistency in the commencement and termination of Ramazan, various Muslim groups have demanded a unified pattern in observing the month of fasting.        
	The traditional method is to look at the sky and sight the crescent moon (hilal), which marks the beginning of Ramazan.        
	If the hilal is seen at night, the next day is the first day of Ramazan and, therefore, the first day of fasting. At the end of the month, when the hilal is sighted again, Id is celebrated.        
	The idea of different parts of the country observing Id on different days is not attractive, and it is time we agreed on a single principle going by the lunar calendar, said Alam Muhammed Khan of the Milli Council.        
	Hamid Jamal Khan of Imam Sangh echoed the view. Ramazan is the holiest month of the Islamic calendar. But it has also been a month of confusion and conflict regarding the timing of fast and the sighting of the moon. Iftar, the breaking of the fast, rather than being a time of spirituality becomes a time of confusion as one wonders which of the azaans (prayer calls) is the correct one. A scientific practice is the only solution to the confusion.        
	It is not unusual, Hamid said, to hear azaans at slightly different times from mosques in the same area.        
	Community leaders are considering two suggestions. One is to determine the day on the basis of the lunar calendar. The other is to follow the Saudi Arabian date.        
	There is a debate within the community and a perception that the system needs to be more scientific. All Muslim groups have had different meetings and a decision will be taken soon, said S.Q.R. Illyasi of Jamaat Islami-e-Hind.        
	Maulana Kalbe Sadiq, senior vice-president of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, believes the solution lies in following the lunar calendar. The lunar calendar is the best way to find out the date as it can tell you when the new moon will be there, irrespective of whether someone sighted it or didnt said Sadiq, a renowned Shia cleric.        
	Some, though, favour going by the moon sighting in Saudi Arabia and say it will create a sense of unity and brotherhood in the Muslim world. But this method doesnt have many takers as the general preference is for a local sighting.        
	Then there are others who feel the traditional practice is the best. Maulana Khalid Rasheed, the head of the Firangi Mahal Islamic seminary, is of the view that the visibility of the moon is absolutely indispensable to Islam.         
	We cannot do away with the old tradition and practice, he said.

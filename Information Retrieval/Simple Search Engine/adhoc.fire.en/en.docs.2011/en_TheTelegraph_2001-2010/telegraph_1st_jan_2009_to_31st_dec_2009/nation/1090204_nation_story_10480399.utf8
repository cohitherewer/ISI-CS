	Raipur, Feb. 3: Thirty-two Congress legislators were today suspended from the Assembly for trooping into the well of the House in protest against the alleged killing of civilians in a fake police encounter in Dantewada district on January 8.        
	The suspended Congress MLAs include Leader of Opposition Ravindra Choubey, former chief minister Ajit Jogi and his wife Renu Jogi, who represents the Kota constituency.        
	The Congress members today moved an adjournment motion, demanding immediate discussion on the alleged fake police encounter in which 17 people were killed.         
	Home minister Nankiram Kanwar clarified that those killed in the encounter were Maoists and the police had sufficient evidences to establish it.         
	He, however, denied discussion on the issue, stating that the matter was sub-judice and the House could not take up the issue.

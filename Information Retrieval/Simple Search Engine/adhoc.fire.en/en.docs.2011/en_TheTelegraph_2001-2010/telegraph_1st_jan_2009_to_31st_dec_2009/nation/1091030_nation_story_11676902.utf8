          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                The fuel depot of the Indian Oil Corporation in Jaipur in flames. (PTI)      
	Jaipur, Oct. 29: Up to five people are feared killed as fire from oil tanker blasts at an Indian Oil Corporation depot spread 3-4km across an industrial belt here tonight.        
	People were fleeing the Sitapura industrial area, located along the arterial Tonk Road. Police said two persons had died but unconfirmed reports said 100 people injured and five had burnt to death.        
	The fire was still uncontrolled around midnight with the leaping flames visible from 25km away. Companies like Infosys and GE have their offices in the area, and their windowpanes were broken by the impact of the blasts.        
	Eyewitnesses said there were at least 3-4 blasts but it couldnt be ascertained how many of the five oil tankers at the depot caught fire. The spread of the fire suggests many homes, shops and factories are burning.        
	The reason for the fire is yet to be known but police blamed a probable leak in one of the tankers. Reports said the tankers probably had 80-90 lakh litres of petrol, which would have fuelled the blaze.        
	Electricity has been cut off to the entire area as a safety measure, and nearby homes have been evacuated.        
	Superintendent of police (south) Jose Mohan said 35 fire engines had reached the site. Officials said three army columns had arrived and a team of firefighters had left Mumbai for Jaipur.        
	The 5sqkm Sitapura industrial area is one of the biggest industrial hubs in the city and houses many engineering colleges. It is home to about 5,000 big and small units, including a special economic zone of the gem and jewellery industry and another of garments, the citys two main export-oriented industries.

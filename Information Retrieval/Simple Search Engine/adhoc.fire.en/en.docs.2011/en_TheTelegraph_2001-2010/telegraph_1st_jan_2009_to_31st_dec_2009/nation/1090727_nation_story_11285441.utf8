                                                                                                               Reliance lobbying bill in US 
                            
	Washington, July 26 (PTI): Reliance outspent the Indian government on lobbying US lawmakers in the last quarter, says a report that puts at over $10 million (Rs 50 crore) the sum paid by the Centre and Indian companies so far this year.        
	Disclosure reports filed by high-profile lobbyist firm BGR reveal that the Mukesh Ambani-run company paid it $1.90 lakh (Rs 92 lakh) in April-June, higher than the governments $1.8 lakh (Rs 87 lakh).        
	Nearly $5.6 million (Rs 26.8 crore) was spent in April-June and $4.6 million (Rs 22.08 crore) in January-March, taking the total to over $10 million, according to the report, filed with the US Senate.        
	The figures underscore the importance of US lawmakers in influencing a large number of policies affecting India and its firms.        
	BGR lobbyists have previously served in the White House and Congress. The firm is known to have been effective at stopping or changing many policies considered to be harmful for its clients, including Fortune 500 firms, other countries and trade bodies.        
	Together, the government and Reliance accounted for nearly three-fourths of the total spending. Tata Sons, software industry body Nasscom, Gujarat Flurochemicals, Sun Pharma and Orchid Chemicals are some of other the firms mentioned in the BGR report.

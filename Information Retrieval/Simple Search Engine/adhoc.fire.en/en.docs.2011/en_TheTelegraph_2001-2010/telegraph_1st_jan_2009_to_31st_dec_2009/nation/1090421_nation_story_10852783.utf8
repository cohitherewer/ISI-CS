The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ragging cell soon, alcoholism blamed
                                                                                                               Ragging cell soon, alcoholism blamed
                            
	New Delhi, April 20 (PTI) A central anti-ragging agency would be set up in a week, the government told the Supreme Court today after placing a report that cited alcoholism on campus as the main reason behind the menace.         
	The concept of the central agency with a website having a helpline was the brainchild of Rajender Kachroo, whose son Aman died after being assaulted by seniors last month.        
	Additional solicitor-general Gopal Subramanium told the bench: Rajender Kachroo has treated the personal tragedy as a motivation for doing social service and has suggested the setting up of a central agency which will be a web-based agency with a helpline. The government will make it operational within a week.         
	The report by a committee that probed the ragging and death of 19-year-old Aman said: One of the near unanimous responses from all quarters is that alcoholism on the college campus is the main reason that generated violence leading to the serious form of ragging that was seen in the Aman episode.        
	It said the inquiry committee found that the wardens and assistant wardens in the college took their assignments reluctantly and did not discharge their duties as was required of them.        
	The report also pointed out that the wardens were found to be living outside the hostel premises, defeating the purpose of creating such a position.         
	Aman, a first-year student of Dr Rajendra Prasad Government Medical College in Kangra, Himachal Pradesh, died on March 8 after his eardrum burst following beatings in the hands of four seniors.

          CITHARA PAUL                                      
	New Delhi, March 14: The aura of a 5,000-year-old civilisation, its array of historical monuments and mosaic of scenic spots  India should be a tourism promoters dream.        
	Yet Slumdog Millionaire would have done more for Indian tourism than all the advertisement campaigns run by the tourism ministry, a bureaucrat chuckled.        
	Despite the hype about Incredible India in the government ads, the country ranks 62nd on the list of the worlds 130 most attractive destinations, according to the World Economic Forums latest annual report.        
	Forget list-toppers Switzerland, Austria or Canada  even Vietnam is above India.        
	The list has many subheads, each dealing with one aspect of tourism. When it comes to tourism policy environment  meaning the packages and incentives offered to travellers  India languishes near the bottom at No. 108.        
	The country, however, gets the number one spot on one sub-list  the one relating to attendance of global tourism trade fairs. Which means that although Indian officials have been bustling about the planet, attending each and every tourism fair held anywhere, the junkets havent brought results.        
	The World Economic Forum report agrees: Despite government and industry efforts to promote the country abroad, the assessment of marketing and branding to attract tourists remains average.        
	One reason why the industry  said to contribute around six per cent of the GDP and employ more than 4 crore people  is limping is that there just arent enough hotel rooms.        
	For instance, about 51,000 hotel rooms would be needed for the delegates, participants and visitors at next years Commonwealth Games in Delhi, but the national capital has only 11,000 rooms to offer as yet.        
	Even the tourism ministrys ambitious bed-and-breakfast scheme, which was expected to turn private homes into tourist guesthouses, has failed to take off because few Indian families are interested.        
	The World Economic Forum has ranked India 73rd on tourism infrastructure, a key yardstick for which is the number of hotel rooms on offer.        
	According to official statistics, 49.5 lakh foreign tourists visited India last year, a drop from the 50.8 lakh who came in 2007. The obvious excuses for the ministry, of course, are the global economic downturn and the Mumbai carnage that targeted foreigners.        
	Although these explanations do have merit, industry insiders say the governments failure to project India as a safe destination has less to do with the western tourists fear of Pakistani gunmen than her fear of the preying Indian male.        
	Despite dozens of foreign tourists being robbed, molested, raped and even killed at prime Indian locations, the proposal to form a tourism police remains largely on paper.        
	Many countries, such as the US and the UK, have repeatedly issued advisories to their citizens against travelling to India. The ministry, though, is happy to put the onus of tourist security on the state governments.        
	The recession, of course, has hurt the travel and hospitality sectors in nearly every country. Close to 60 per cent of hotel bookings were cancelled across India in the last quarter of 2008. The ministry has asked for an economic stimulus package for the industry, but the demand has not yet been met.        
	The ministrys incentives  such as a buy-one-get-one-free offer on international air tickets, one-night complimentary stays in hotels, and free sightseeing tours  have only raised tourist arrivals marginally.        
	Some of the tourism ministrys ideas have clicked in the past five years, though, such as the Buddhist circuits and the tea and adventure tourism packages.        
	Medical tourism has seen a huge jump with foreigners flocking to Indian hospitals for cheap but efficient treatment. The UPA governments decision to grade the hospitals through a process of accreditation has given the sector more credibility, and tourism minister Ambika Soni is said to have played a key role in this.         
	One encouraging sign in the past few years has been the vigour in domestic tourism, thanks to an expanding middle class. Not much, however, has been done to cater to this emerging clientele by building affordable accommodation.

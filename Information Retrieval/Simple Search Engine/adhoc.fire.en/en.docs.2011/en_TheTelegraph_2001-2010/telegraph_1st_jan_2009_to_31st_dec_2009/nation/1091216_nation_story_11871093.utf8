	New Delhi, Dec. 15 (PTI): India has revised its regulations on the entry of foreigners holding long-term tourist visas in the aftermath of revelations that Pakistani-American terror suspect David Coleman Headley visited the country using such documents.        
	In an advisory to its citizens, the US has said Delhi has revised the regulations and that various points of entry in India have started enforcing the new rules.        
	Americans with five or ten-year tourist visas will no longer be allowed to enter India within two months of their last departure if their last visit was longer than 90 days or if they have stayed longer than 180 days during the past year, the advisory, posted on the US embassy website, said.         
	The revision comes in wake of the arrest of Headley and his associate, Pakistani-Canadian Tahawwur Rana Hussain, by the FBI on charges of plotting terror attacks in India. Both were issued multi-entry visas by India without proper security clearances.

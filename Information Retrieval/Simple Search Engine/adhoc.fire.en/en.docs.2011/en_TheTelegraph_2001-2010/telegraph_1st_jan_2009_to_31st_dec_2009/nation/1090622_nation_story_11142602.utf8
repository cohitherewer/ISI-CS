The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ban opinion differs in front, CPM 
                                                                                                               Ban opinion differs in front, CPM 
          BISWAJIT ROY                              
	Calcutta, June 21: A section of the CPM and Left Front allies are either sceptical of or opposed to banning the CPI (Maoist), though chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had yesterday said he was giving serious thought to outlawing the organisation.        
	The misgivings spring from fears that a ban would help the Maoists strike deeper roots in deprived areas and also an undeclared fellow-feeling for a distant ideological cousin.        
	The reservations within the CPM were evident from the silence of state secretary Biman Bose who cut short his Delhi visit and came back along with Bhattacharjee last night, skipping the second day of the central committee meeting.         
	The party session is still on. Bimanda will spell out our position in due time when the decision will be taken, a CPM source said this evening, asked about the CPMs stand on banning the Maoists.         
	The central committee members have left the issue to the state government as the party dodged a ban decision, which the chief minister is believed to be in favour of.         
	We have not decided. Neither was it discussed in the central committee since it was not on the agenda. Let us go back to Calcutta and ponder, party veteran Benoy Konar said from Delhi.         
	Another party leader pointed to the CPM leaderships statements last week that the Maoists would be fought politically. When the things are in a flux in Lalgarh, the government needs to repel the Maoists with its might and restore law and order. But a political fight is the answer in the long term.        
	Sources said the government was not likely to take a decision in a hurry.         
	 No decision has been taken, the chief secretary said today after a long meeting with the chief minister who had spoken of the rethink yesterday after a vocal public nudge by Union home minister P. Chidambaram.        
	Among the allies, the RSP spelt out its opposition to the banning of the Maoist party. The Forward Bloc and the CPI stopped short of a categorical veto but underscored the need for serious discussions.        
	Some allies also reminded the government that it did not ban the RSS-VHP-Bajrang Dal troika after the Babri mosque demolition and riots.        
	We dont think banning will be a solution. It will be rather counter-productive as it will help the Maoists to project themselves as true champions of tribals and other poor people, said RSP central committee member and former MP Manoj Bhattacharjee.         
	Its a serious matter and we cant commit either way without discussions in each of the partner parties as well as in the Left Front, Bloc leader Asoke Ghosh said.         
	One of his colleagues, however, said Ghosh had expressed reservations on a ban at the last Left Front meeting. Asokeda made it clear we dont consider Maoists our class enemies as they too preach the same pro-poor politics. So, it is our old stand to oppose the ban, he said.        
	The CPM is facing a dilemma: a ban will make it easier to secure more material support from the Centre in the Lalgarh operation. But the party fears that if it is seen as kow-towing to the Centre, the resultant resentment could alienate the tribals further from the mainstream Left.

          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                              
	Mumbai, Aug. 10: The Maharashtra government has allowed private hospitals to treat patients provided they have isolation wards adhering to World Health Organisation norms.        
	Top government officials told chief executive officers of 19 private hospitals that isolation wards for H1N1 cases should have facilities like dedicated medical staff, separate air-conditioning and at least two ventilators. Among the hospitals in the running are Jaslok, Bombay Hospital, Breach Candy, Lilavati, Wockhardt, Brahmakumari and Hinduja.        
	If they agree to have the ward with these conditions, they have to reply by 5 tomorrow evening, said home secretary Chandra Iyengar.        
	The government said if doctors at private hospitals suspect swine flu, they could start treatment without waiting for a confirmation report.        
	The decision to include private hospitals in the flu fight came on a day the toll across the country touched seven. Four-year-old Sanjay Balakumar died in Chennai, while ayurveda doctor Babasahib Mane succumbed in Punes Sasson Hospital. Sanjay Tilekar, a pharmacist in his mid-thirties, died in the same hospital as the doctor in the evening.         
	Schools, educational institutions, malls and cinemas in Pune, the countrys most affected city, will remain closed for three to seven days.         
	The panic was palpable in Mumbai, where patients swamped Kasturba Hospital, the citys only designated government facility for swine flu treatment.        
	Only a lucky few had the recommended N95 surgical masks on, which doctors say block 95 per cent of particles more than 0.3 microns in size.

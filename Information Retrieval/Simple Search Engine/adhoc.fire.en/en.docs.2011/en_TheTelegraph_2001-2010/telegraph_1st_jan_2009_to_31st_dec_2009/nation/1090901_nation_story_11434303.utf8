          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      A jawan at the site of the blast in Srinagar. (PTI)                          
	Srinagar, Aug. 31: Two pistol-wielding young men opened fire in a crowded area this afternoon and shot a couple of CRPF jawans before a grenade explosion left 25 people injured as militants bloodied the Kashmir capital on the ninth day of Ramazan.        
	The attacks, near the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly complex, came amid rising fears that separatist rebels would step up attacks during the Muslim holy month.        
	The twin strikes came less than a month since terrorists struck twice in two days in the city after a period of lull, and police said the same module behind the August 1 and 2 incidents could be involved in todays attacks.        
	Witnesses said two young men with pistols surfaced in the crowded Budshah Chowk around 1pm and targeted two Central Reserve Police Force jawans of the 28 Battalion from point-blank range.        
	Hit in the head, the constables, identified as Raj Shekhar and Malika Arjun, were both declared brought dead at hospital.        
	As terrified pedestrians ran for cover, a grenade aimed at securitymen exploded in Batamaloo, barely 2km away, injuring 25 people, including 20 civilians.

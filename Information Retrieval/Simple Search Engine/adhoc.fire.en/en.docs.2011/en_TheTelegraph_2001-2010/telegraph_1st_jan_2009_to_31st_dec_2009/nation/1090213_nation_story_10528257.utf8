	New Delhi, Feb. 12 (PTI): Samajwadi Party MP and former Karnataka chief minister S. Bangarappa today resigned from the Lok Sabha as well as the party and announced plans to join the Congress.         
	He said the BJPs victory in the Karnataka Assembly elections was not a good sign and it was time all secular parties united to defeat the communal forces.

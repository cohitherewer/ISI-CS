	Mumbai, June 4: A 46-year-old man flying home from Dubai was arrested today for allegedly molesting an Indian airhostess of Emirates airline.        
	Haroon Salaam Ballai was held after landing around 3am on a complaint from the 22-year-old airhostess of the flight, EK-500. She alleged that Ballai had misbehaved and molested her while she was serving food to passengers, airport police said. Medical tests showed he was inebriated.

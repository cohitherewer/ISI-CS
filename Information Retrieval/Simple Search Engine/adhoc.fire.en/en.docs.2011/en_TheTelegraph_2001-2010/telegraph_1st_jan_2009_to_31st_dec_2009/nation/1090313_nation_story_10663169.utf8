The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mulayam in Holi cash row
                                                                                                               Mulayam in Holi cash row
          OUR BUREAU                              
	March 12: Television footage of 100-rupee notes being handed out at a Holi Milan in Mulayam Singh Yadavs presence has brought the Samajwadi Party chief a code-violation notice from the Election Commission.        
	(The) act of bribing a large number of persons in a public gathering is clear violation of the model code of conduct, the commission said, adding it had seen video reports (on) TV channels.        
	It is apparent that distribution of money in your presence has been made with a view to soliciting votes, the notice added, seeking a response by 11am of March 14, failing which action would be taken without any further notice.        
	The TV pictures show a relaxed Mulayam reclining on a sofa in his home village  Saifai in Etawah district while a local Samajwadi leader distributes the notes among dozens of stretched-out hands. Saifai falls in Mainpuri constituency, which Mulayam plans to contest.        
	A report has been sought from the district magistrate, the states chief electoral officer, A.K. Bishnoi, said in Lucknow.        
	Mulayam told reporters in Kanpur that some drummers were being rewarded for their performance in a cultural programme during Holi.        
	There was nothing political about it. It happens every year. The villagers had forgotten that this was an election year, he said.        
	This time I have not given anything to anyone. If some workers have given something from their own pocket, they have done so on their own.        
	In the past, zamindars would reward Holi dancers or drummers with cash and now the mantle has fallen on rich landlords. If you want to ban it, then ban the Holi festival too, Mulayam said.        
	Samajwadi general secretary Amar Singh echoed him. I gave money at the Bareilly dargah as part of Holi traditions. Should we stop celebrating Holi now? Amar said.        
	Glare on Govinda        
	Congress MP Govinda faced similar charges of cash distribution today with Maharashtras chief electoral officer, Debashish Chakravarty, issuing a notice for an investigation.         
	The actor was caught on camera distributing money among people from his constituency, Mumbai North, who had gathered at his home in Juhu to celebrate Holi yesterday. Juhu is not part of Mumbai North constituency.        
	Maharashtra Congress leader Anant Gadgil said Govinda would not be granted a ticket this time. He has not done anything for his constituency and we may lose it this year, Gadgil said. If he has done such a thing as distributing cash, he will have to face the commissions music.        
	Govinda was not available for comment.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Maoists seize jawan on leave
                                                                                                               Maoists seize jawan on leave
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                         Vulnerable?                                  
	New Delhi, May 20: Suspected Maoists abducted a Chhattisgarh CRPF jawan after picking him out from a busload of civilians in possibly the first instance of the rebels targeting unarmed personnel on their way home.        
	The bus in which the jawan, whose name the CRPF declined to reveal, was travelling with six other colleagues, was stopped near Manikonta in Dantewada on May 16, sources said.        
	The rebels checked all passengers, the sources said, adding that the jawan was targeted because he had his identity card on him.        
	Sources in Chhattisgarh said three jawans had been kidnapped but the CRPF has denied this.        
	The incident, which the state police learnt about a day later, has sent shock waves through the security establishment, raising questions about the safety of forces in the rebel zone while they are headed home or returning to duty.        
	It isnt correct that three of them have been abducted. Only one jawan was kidnapped. We are trying to secure his release, CRPF director-general A.S. Gill told The Telegraph. There is no word about the jawan yet. Gill said the rebels hadnt made any demands.        
	Resentment is growing among other forces against the CRPF top brass for having kept the incident under wraps. They feel such lack of disclosure and warning could make them sitting ducks if the rebels try to target them in a similar way.        
	Gill argued, though, that the disclosure had not been made to ensure that the release efforts were not hampered.        
	The CRPF, the countrys largest paramilitary force, is the mainstay of the anti-Maoist operation in Chhattisgarh with 14 battalions (15,400 personnel). The CISF and the Sashastra Seema Bal have two each. A battalion is made up of 1,100 personnel. The forces also have a large presence in neighbouring Jharkhand, Orissa, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh.        
	The kidnapping has swung the spotlight on the big question of how to ensure safe passage for security personnel in Maoist-affected zones when they go on leave, usually twice a year.         
	The army and paramilitary forces in Jammu and Kashmir had encountered a similar challenge when militants warned they would kill those going on leave.         
	A platoon then started accompanying the home-bound personnel, a solution that may not work in Chhattisgarh as the rebels often booby-trap roads with mines.

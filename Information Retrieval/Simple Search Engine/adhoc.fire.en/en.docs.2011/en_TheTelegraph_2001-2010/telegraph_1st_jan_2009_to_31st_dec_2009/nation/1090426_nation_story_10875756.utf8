          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, April 26: An investigation is on into the strange death of a polling official, who reportedly fell in an underground water tank at Bhubananda Orissa School of Engineering where arrangements were made for storing EVMs.        
	The deceased had been identified as Rajesh Kumar Biswal (26) who was with the faculty at an engineering college. He was appointed presiding officer at a polling booth in the Mahanga Assembly constituency in Cuttack district.         
	A case has been registered at the Manglabag police station. We have registered an unnatural death case and are trying to find out why the underground water tank was left open and who is responsible for the criminal negligence, Manglabag police station inspector-in-charge Alok Jena said today.        
	The police are also trying to determine how the polling official fell inside.        
	The water tank was out of the way from the place where arrangements had been made for receiving EVMs. The area was also not well-lit, he said.        
	The police said preliminary investigations revealed that Rajesh had slipped into the underground water tank and died around 2.40am. He had reached the campus around midnight after polling to deposit the EVMs of his booth.         
	Polling officials from other Assembly constituencies in the district had also gathered at the engineering institute to deposit their respective EVMs.         
	Other polling officials noticed the man around 2.30am after they heard yells from the tank, which was around 12ft deep and little over half full.        
	The institute was turned into a receiving centre for electronic voting machines used in Barabati, Cuttack, Choudwar Cuttack, Sadar Cuttack, Mahanga and Niali Assembly constituencies.

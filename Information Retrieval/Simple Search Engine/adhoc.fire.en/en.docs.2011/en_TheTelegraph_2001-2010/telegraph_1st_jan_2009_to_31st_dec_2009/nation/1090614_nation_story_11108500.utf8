          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Srinagar, June 13: The annual Amarnath yatra has raised the concerns of the Jammu and Kashmir government with thousands of pilgrims coming from regions where swine flu has been detected.        
	The state government is already battling poor weather and security issues to ensure a smooth yatra.         
	Around five lakh pilgrims from across the country and abroad are expected to undertake this years pilgrimage to the cave shrine, scheduled to begin on June 16.         
	The state health department has already taken a slew of protective measures.        
	A screening centre and an isolation ward has been set up at Qazigund, the entry point to Kashmir.        
	Separate wards have been set up at Sonamarg and Pahalgam, the two take-off points for the pilgrimage, to quarantine people who show symptoms of the disease.         
	We have already set up two counters at Srinagar airport to screen the passengers including the pilgrims who might be going to the cave shrine by a chopper, a government official said.         
	Muzaffar Ahmad, the director of the health department, said any pilgrim showing symptoms of the pandemic HINI influenza would be screened at Qazigund.         
	A minimum of five doctors would be available at the centre, Ahmad said.

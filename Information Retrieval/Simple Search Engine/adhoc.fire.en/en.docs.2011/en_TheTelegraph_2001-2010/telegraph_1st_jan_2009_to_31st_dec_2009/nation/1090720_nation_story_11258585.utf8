	July 19: Orissa cops have accused the Naveen Patnaik government of leaving them vulnerable to Maoist attacks by sitting on long-standing demands for better arms and equipment.        
	The resentment, building up for a while, burst into the open on a day the chief minister attended the funeral of a sub-inspector killed by Maoists last week.        
	The Orissa Police Association (OPA), which represents over 7,000 inspectors and sub-inspectors, said sub-inspector Ajit Bardhan may have been alive if the government had given the force modern weapons. Government inaction has armed the rebels, association secretary Sunil Mohanty said.        
	The association will hold a meeting in the last week of this month to chalk out its course of action, Mohanty said, without specifying what the steps would include.         
	Association president S.N. Sharma seconded Mohanty. We need choppers for combing and rescue operations. It has demanded at least two.         
	Sharma said Bardhans bullet-riddled body was found only after 36 hours, appearing to blame the delay on the lack of upgrade. Bardhans last rites were performed with full state honours.        
	Eleven state police personnel, as many CISF jawans and a CRPF man have died in rebel attacks so far this year.        
	Padmanav Behera, the president of Orissa Havildar and Constable Federation, which has 40,000 members, said: We face Maoist bullets and all we get is honour posthumously. We need weapons instead of pep-talk or wreaths.         
	State police chief M.M. Praharaj said steps were being taken to bring in sophisticated arms.         
	The Opposition has tapped the discontent, saying the governments attitude had made the policemen sitting ducks. Leader of the Opposition, the Congresss Bhupinder Singh, said: The government has failed miserably in drafting strong weapon policies to battle the rebels.        
	Singh pointed out that junior officers and jawans often bore the brunt of the failure to upgrade arms and facilities as they were at the forefront of the anti-insurgency operations.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hasina offers SEZ refuge 
                                                                                                               Hasina offers SEZ refuge 
  - Love thy neighbour: Bangla seeks Mamata tips; India agriculture help for Lanka         JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Hasina                                        
	Dhaka, July 23: Special economic zone worshippers wary of crossing Mamata Banerjees path have been offered solace by another Bengali lady but from across the border.        
	Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed has invited Indian investments in special economic zones being planned in her country.        
	We welcome Indian investments... we will be setting up special economic zones and Indian investors are welcome to take advantage of the new policy, Hasina told a delegation of Indian industrialists.        
	Bangladesh is planning to set up several SEZs  a much-maligned hot potato in India after Nandigram  near the border from the end of this year, possibly eyeing Indian investors who are jittery after the land backlash back home.        
	Dhaka has promised tax holidays of up to 10 years, other tax breaks and fees for technical know-how.        
	The Prime Minister has promised all support. If Indian businessmen come forward to set up the SEZs, the government will extend all cooperation, said Hasina, perceived to be more industry-friendly than her predecessors.

	But Mamata need not see competition in Hasina. The Bangladesh Prime Minister, who watched the Indian railway budget on television, has sent Mamata a message seeking help in modernising the mass transport utility. I have sent a message to Mamata Banerjee... we want Indian expertise to help develop our railways, Hasina said.        
	Amit Mitra of Ficci, who has been appointed by Mamata to help draw up plans for the railways projects in public-private partnerships, was also part of the delegation to Dhaka.          
	Hasina made one offer Bengal need not find palatable. She offered India the use of a port, which could take business away from Bengals Calcutta and Haldia docks. The Bangladesh port, Mongla in Khulna, is near the border with Bengals North 24-Parganas.        
	The gesture opens the possibility of Indian firms, especially those in Calcutta and elsewhere in the east, bringing in shipments skipping the Calcutta and Haldia ports.        
	Places such as Uttara, Mongla, Narsinghdi in Khulna are seen as possible sites for Bangladeshs SEZs.        
	Indian investor interest in Bangladesh ebbed last year after the Tatas dropped proposals to invest $3 billion in a steel mill, a power plant and a fertiliser factory because of lack of infrastructure support, including supply of gas to run the proposed plants.        
	The Indian team appeared happy. I think she (Hasina) made very pragmatic offers to Indian business ... now it is up to us to seize this opportunity, said Mitra, whose Ficci had organised the visit.

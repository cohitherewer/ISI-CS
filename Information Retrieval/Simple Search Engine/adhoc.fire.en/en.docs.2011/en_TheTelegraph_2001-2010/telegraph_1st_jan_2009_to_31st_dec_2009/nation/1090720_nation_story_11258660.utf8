The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ethics tug at House conscience 
                                                                                                               Ethics tug at House conscience 
  - MPs mull code to check vested interests of industrialists in standing committees        RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                                  
	New Delhi, July 19: Six years ago, when a Rajya Sabha MP who was a hotelier asked a question in the House about government plans relating to a luxury tax on hotels, members protested.        
	The Chairman told the finance minister not to answer the question and the matter was referred to the ethics committee that said vested interests should not mar Parliaments working.        
	But such referral was a one-off. The same MP continued putting queries relating to the hospitality industry and receiving answers.        
	Worse, as member of the consultative committee on finance, he recommended full infrastructure status and new tax exemptions for the tourism industry during a pre-budget consultation.        
	Now Parliament is waking up to the gravity of the problem, especially since more and more corporate heads are getting into Parliament, mainly the Rajya Sabha. Many are becoming members of standing or consultative committees on ministries that often relate to their area of business, creating potential conflicts of interest.        
	Unlike House queries that are asked in public, these committees discuss matters in private. They can access privileged information on government plans and can influence policy through recommendations that are non-binding but about half of which are usually accepted.        
	They scrutinise the smallest details of fiscal and budget proposals, so their reports often become the basis of budget discussions and amendments.        
	As the new government goes about setting up the 17 House panels, many UPA and Opposition members have stressed the need to evolve a binding conflict of interest code for MPs.         
	All that Parliament has now is an appeal to the members conscience to put the duty of their public office over their private interests.        
	This is simply not effective enough to deal with the increasingly elitist character of the House, said Janata Dal (United) spokesperson K.C. Tyagi. His formula is simple: Vested interests must not be taken in on such prestigious committees.        
	Government sources said Tyagis suggestion was impractical since according to parliamentary practice, parties are allowed to nominate panel members and even choose committees of their liking provided they have the numbers to buttress their claim.        
	For instance, an airline owner became a member of the standing committee on industries and a permanent invitee to the consultative committee on civil aviation.        
	A media magnate has been on the panels for the communications and IT and the information and broadcasting (I amp;B) ministries; another industrialist has been member of the consultative committee on the finance and petroleum and natural gas ministries.        
	The I amp;B standing committee headed by Somnath Chatterjee that debated FDI in print had a print media baron (now deceased) as its member.        
	BJP spokesperson Prakash Javdekar agreed that we should be careful in allotting committees but said he didnt want to discuss the complicated issue on record.        
	Some MPs, including a cabinet minister, have advocated that India emulate Canada, the only country to have a conflict of interest code for its MPs (see chart).         
	These MPs disagree with law minister M. Veerappa Moily that a codified law is not necessary and that Parliament can work on the basis of an understanding of ethics and propriety.        
	The Rajya Sabha ethics committee indeed asks members to declare any private interest in a matter under consideration in the House or a committee, but unlike the Canadian code does not ask them to abstain from the debate.        
	The government will have to legislate on the issue sooner than later because the use of money power is becoming more and more evident in Parliament, said the CPMs Basudeb Acharya, who headed the House panel on railways for years.        
	Rajeev Chandrasekhar, BPL Mobile founder who is now an Independent Rajya Sabha member, has suggested another solution: televise standing committee proceedings.        
	The Rajya Sabha now has seven corporate honchos, their interests ranging from textiles, cement and petroleum to manufacturing, real estate and the media.         
	They all are, or have been, members of standing committees on IT and communications, I amp;B, urban development, commerce and industry, finance, petroleum and natural gas, and heavy industries and public enterprises.        
	Sources said that by and large, parties are more cautious while nominating Lok Sabha MPs to committees since a scam involving these pubic representatives can heavily damage the party.        
	Ramachandra Guha, historian and social-political commentator, said: In the past, members themselves should have refrained from joining committees which potentially involved a conflict of interest. It is better to evolve a code of ethics. It may be a small step but I am glad the government is thinking about it.        
	Rajeev Gowda, professor of public policy at IIM Bangalore, said: An enforceable code of ethics makes sense. Whether this code is a set of guidelines or something actionable will have to be debated.        
	A standing committee considers a ministrys demands for grants, examines its bills and annual reports, and considers long-term policy documents presented in the House if these are referred to it by the presiding officers.        
	It can demand all sorts of official information and records, and summon government officials, technical experts and even private citizens. A source said that theoretically, an industrialist on such a panel can summon a rival companys officials and try to prise information.        
	The committee reports are adopted by broad consensus among members, with a provision for notes of dissent. A ministry has to compulsorily act on the reports recommendations and furnish action-taken replies within three months to the committee.        
	The recommendations are not binding but the ministry has to explain itself if it does not accept a suggestion.

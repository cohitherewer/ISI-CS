The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Minister orders artists out of gallery
                                                                                                               Minister orders artists out of gallery
          AJAY SUKUMARAN                      The National Gallery of Modern Art in Bangalore. (Bangalore News Photo)                          
	Bangalore, Feb. 18: The National Gallery of Modern Art, Bangalores latest showpiece, had a stormy opening today with a Karnataka minister angering artists with his comments and ordering them out of the gallery.        
	Union minister for tourism and culture Ambika Soni had to intervene before tempers cooled and the inauguration got under way.        
	The trouble began when Ramachandra Gowda, the minister for medical education, said: Modern art has become a medium for insulting ancient Indian culture amongst pseudo-intellectuals.        
	Some artists interrupted him, saying he had no right to say that because he did not know anything about art. Gowda shot back that he had the freedom to speak his mind and ordered police to send the artists out.        
	Soni, whose ministry hosted the event, intervened. Please dont leave. We are not going to impose any value system on anybody, she said.         
	By that time, several artists had walked out.         
	They insulted artists, said M.S. Murthy, a Bangalore-based artist who left the gallery.        
	He should not have taken up the subject without seeing the exhibition, said S.G. Vasudev, another artist.         
	Gowda later said that he did not mean to hurt anybody.         
	The minister attracted criticism a few months ago when he said the government should ban beer.         
	Gowdas statement on culture today came just weeks after an attack on women in a pub in Mangalore, Karnataka.         
	The attack was ostensibly aimed at preventing pub culture among women to safeguard Indian culture.        
	The Bangalore gallery, the southern branch of the National Gallery of Modern Art in New Delhi, has been nearly 20 years in the making.        
	The gallery  proposed in the 1980s  had been stalled because the state government could not find a suitable location. It is now housed in Manickvelu Mansion, a heritage building on Palace Road.

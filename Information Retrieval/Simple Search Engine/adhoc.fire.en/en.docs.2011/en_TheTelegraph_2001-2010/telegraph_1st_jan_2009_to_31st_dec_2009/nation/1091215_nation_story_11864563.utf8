          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Orissa Assembly in session                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 14: The state cabinet today recommended that the governor prorogue the winter session of Orissa Assembly that was adjourned sine die on December 5, even as Opposition members continued running the adjourned House unofficially, in protest against the abrupt adjournment.        
	Chief secretary T.K. Mishra told the media that the cabinet today approved the proposal for the prorogation of the Assembly. The cabinet proceedings will be sent to the governor soon for his action, official sources here said.        
	The Assembly session is usually summoned and prorogued by the governor on the basis of government recommendations.         
	However, the winter session of Assembly was adjourned sine die on December 5. The session was originally scheduled to conclude on December 19.        
	Peeved over the premature adjournment of the winter session of the state Assembly, Opposition members had marched to Raj Bhavan on December 6 to lodge their protest against the undemocratic and unconstitutional act of the Naveen Patnaik government. Led by Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh, the Opposition Congress and BJP MLAs had met Governor M.C. Bhandare.         
	They had urged the latter not to prorogue the Assembly and to direct the government to summon the session for the rest of the days.         
	However, the governor did not prorogue the session nor did he recall it for the rest of the days.        
	Waiting for the governors decision, the Congress, BJP and Independent members have been staying put in the House since December 5 evening and continuing to hold business as usual without the treasury bench and the Speaker.        
	We will continue to run the Assembly till December 19, the date on which the session was scheduled to conclude, said Opposition chief whip Prasad Harichandan.        
	However, chief minister Naveen Patnaik described the Opposition move as illegal and unconstitutional.         
	State parliamentary affairs minister Raghunath Mohanty told The Telegraph that the Opposition had destroyed the sanctity of the sacred House.        
	Amid allegations and counter-allegations by the Opposition and the government, political circles here are waiting for the action of the governor.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Alice goes soft, Blunderland holds fire   Shourie told to clarify

	New Delhi, Aug. 25: The BJP is not yet in dump-ty mode on Arun Shourie.        
	Having expelled Jaswant Singh in haste, the party leadership is moving cautiously on the man who yesterday called it Humpty Dumpty and asked for heads to roll. Those who had spoken of Shouries impending expulsion sounded uncertain today.        
	Rajnath Singh, taunted as Alice in Blunderland, has sought a clarification from Shourie, but spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudys comments revealed the party presidents soft attitude.        
	If somebody writes a show-cause notice, that will be wrong; it is only a clarification, Rudy said.        
	Asked if the party was ready to digest Shouries violent attack, he said: The party has taken cognisance of what he said.        
	A senior leader told The Telegraph that expulsion was not on the cards. Without criticising Shouries comments, he said: Whats the hurry? We should study the whole gamut; what is the context, what is the reason, what is the motive. We can think of action after that.        
	BJP leaders concede that Shouries behaviour was far more outrageous than anything Jaswant had done. But they say the party has learnt from the hasty action it took on Jaswant.        
	One crucial reason for the restraint, however, is the support Shourie enjoys in the larger Sangh parivar. Jaswant was never an RSS darling but Shourie has built a constituency among the saffron ranks through his writings and ideological inclination.        
	Unlike the BJPs other intellectual friends and members, Shourie has never attacked Hindutva. Even in his latest outburst, he advocated greater Sangh role in BJP affairs.        
	Even intra-party politics has favoured Shourie. His main targets have been L.K. Advani and Arun Jaitley, and that suits the rival camp even if the splinters injure a few of them.                  A deserted BJP headquarters on Tuesday. (PTI)      
	Sources said Rajnath was looking at Shouries offence through the prism of Vasundhara Rajes defiance and blackmail which, some party leaders feel, has compromised the BJP presidents prestige. Vasundhara has again refused to resign because her demands have not been met.        
	Rajnath, who met office-bearers this morning, did not betray any sense of hurry in punishing Shourie after having been forced to move at a snails pace in Vasundharas case.        
	Jaswant, of course, had been promptly thrown out because Narendra Modi had made the demand and Advani aide Ananth Kumar vociferously supported it. Sources say Murli Manohar Joshi had opposed his expulsion, suggesting senior leaders hear him out first.        
	Even Yashwant Sinhas resignation from all party posts was accepted quickly but Vasundhara has been allowed to cock a snook at the party president because she enjoys the support of a section of central leaders.

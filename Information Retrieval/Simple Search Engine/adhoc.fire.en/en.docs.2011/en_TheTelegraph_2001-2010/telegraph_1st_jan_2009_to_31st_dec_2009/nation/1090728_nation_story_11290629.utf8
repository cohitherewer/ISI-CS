The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cracks in 18 Metro pillars
                                                                                                               Cracks in 18 Metro pillars
                            
	New Delhi, July 27 (PTI): Cracks have been detected in 18 pillars on three under-construction Delhi Metro corridors, one of which was to become functional in about a month.        
	A crack in a pillar on another route had caused an unfinished Metro bridge to collapse on July 12 and kill six people. The Metro described the latest cracks as minor.        
	Metro engineers had noticed the cracks while checking all the corridors during an inspection drive prompted by the July 12 tragedy.        
	They found hairline cracks on eight piers of the Central Secretariat-Gurgaon corridor, two piers of the Noida corridor and eight piers of the Central Secretariat-Badarpur corridor. All appear to be minor, Metro chief public relations officer Anuj Dayal said.        
	The DMRC (Delhi Metro Railway Corporation) will carry out further corrective action if required and take necessary remedial measures after Shirish Patel and Associates have examined these locations.        
	Shirish Patel and Associates, a civil engineering and structural consultant, was hired to conduct a structural audit after the bridge collapse. It will re-examine the designs of all the 18 points where cracks have been seen.        
	Chief minister Sheila Dikshit played down the discovery. It happens sometimes. The DMRC is studying the nature of the cracks, she said, adding that a crack here and there did not mean the whole construction was faulty.

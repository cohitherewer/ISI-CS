The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pitfalls of a rushed 100-day honeymoon
                                                                                                               Pitfalls of a rushed 100-day honeymoon
  - The race among UPA ministers to announce agendas may have thrown up fresh ideas but it could turn sour if the promises are not met, warn experts           CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                                  
	New Delhi, July 1: The race among UPA ministers to announce 100-day agendas has thrown up refreshing policy ideas but rushing to implement proposed reforms without adequate debate could backfire on the nation, public policy experts have said.         
	Dramatic examination reforms, unprecedented transparency in the functioning of higher judiciary and in environmental clearance for projects  proposed in the 100-day blueprints  are ideas deserving the nations attention, the experts said.         
	But the unveiled plans lack detail and any rush to implement reforms without debate could prove counterproductive  both for the government and for the nation  they warned.         
	Human resource development minister Kapil Sibal, law minister Veerappa Moily and urban development minister S. Jaipal Reddy have held news conferences to announce elaborate 100-day plans within days of each other.         
	Environment minister Jairam Ramesh also addressed a press briefing to announce his ministrys plans but distanced himself from the race between ministers by specifying that his was not a 100-day agenda.         
	There are lots of potentially radical and interesting proposals worthy of our attention. But some of them lack detail and we should not take the 100-day target too literally. After all, the government takes its own time to work, Pratap Bhanu Mehta, President of the centre for policy research in Delhi said.         
	The concept of a 100-day target in modern democracies can be traced back at least as far back as Franklin Roosevelts presidency.         
	Roosevelt announced an ambitious 100-day plan to revive a struggling economy when he took over as President of the United States in 1933. Fifteen legislations that combined to form his New Deal were passed in the first 100 days of Roosevelts first tenure, and fuelled the American revival from the Great Depression. American Presidents, ever since, are evaluated for their performance in the first 100 days of a tenure.         
	In India, H.D. Deve Gowdas United Front government announced a 100-day agenda in 1996 which, public policy researchers say, remained largely unimplemented. I.K. Gujral, who took over from Gowda as Prime Minister, continued the practice. The NDA, both in 1998  when its government lasted for a year  and in 1999 announced 100-day plans.                     Roosevelt: The trendsetter		    
	From day one, this government has indicated it wants to follow a perform or perish policy. That is a good sign for the nation. And given the high targets, even if half the 100-day promises are accomplished, it would prove remarkable, Rajeev Gowda, professor in public policy at the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore said.         
	One way ministries who have unveiled their time-bound agendas can play for more time to fulfill plans is by tinkering with the starting date for the 100 days.         
	A cabinet secretariat source said that under the plan outlined by the Prime Minister, the 100 days for the implementation of the agenda began with the Presidents address to Parliament on June 4. The 100 days, under this definition, end on September 12.         
	But different ministers have indicated that they will begin their count of a 100 days from their respective announcements of agendas. Sibal, who announced his plans on June 25, can claim time till October 3 to show results. It is unclear whether the Prime Minister will enforce September 12 as the 100-day mark or allow his ministers the liberty of defining the end of the period according to their convenience.         
	Gowda, however, warned against rushed implementation of dramatic reforms suggested in fields such as education.         
	You cannot rush into major reforms in sectors like education without adequate consultations and debates, the IIM professor said.         
	Environment minister Ramesh has himself criticised HRD minister Sibal for rushing to introduce reforms in education without adequate consultation with states, in an interview to a news agency.         
	Project delays are blamed on red tapism. True, bureaucracy can be a hinderance. But another key reason proposals take time to implement in government is the number of checks and balances in place, a retired education secretary argued, requesting anonymity.         
	Any new central policy on a concurrent subject involves a series of consultations, which often take years before a concensus can be arrived at, even if all states and the Centre agree on the concept.         
	The Right to Education Bill, for instance, is a proposed law accepted as necessary by lawmakers across political parties, and across states.         
	But the NDA  between 2002 and 2004  and then the UPA failed to get the act passed in Parliament despite keen efforts. The reason: a sequence of minor disagreements, first between the Centre and states, and then between different arms of the Centre.         
	The idea of a government working intensely to implement tasks in its initial honeymoon period is in itself sensible, argued the public policy experts.         
	This is the period when the government, fresh with a mandate, feels most confident. Opposition parties are down and it makes sense to capitalise this period to fulfill as many of a governments promises as are possible. Later it will face more opposition, Mehta said.

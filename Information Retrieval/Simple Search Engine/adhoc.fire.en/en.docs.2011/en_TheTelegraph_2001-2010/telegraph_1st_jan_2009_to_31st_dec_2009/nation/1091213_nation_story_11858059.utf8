          MUZAFFAR RAINA                              
	Srinagar, Dec. 12: The fringe groups demanding trifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir have suddenly come alive, courtesy Telangana.        
	The demands for a Jammu state and a Union territory of Ladakh are decades old but have lost steam over the years in the absence of support from any major political party here. Telangana has perked the trifurcation lobbies.        
	We hope statehood for Jammu will be a reality. We will keep striving, said Ashwani Kumar, leader of the Jammu State Morcha, which spearheads the statehood demand.        
	We have been discriminated against by Kashmir-centric politicians. It was in 1953 that we first raised our voice for a separate state.        
	The Ladakh Union Territory Front too is optimistic. We were an independent state till 1836 when the Dogras annexed us. We raised the demand for Union territory status in 1947 and have been fighting for it since, front president Thupstun Chewang said.        
	On December 8, we organised a major rally here. We are busy with a festival now but will intensify our demand after December 18.        
	Although the proposed trifurcation follows geographical lines, the demand has strong communal overtones. Several Hindu outfits back the morchas demand and Buddhist groups the Ladakh fronts. Muslims in both regions largely oppose the states division.        
	With an area of 16,000sqkm, the Kashmir valley is the states smallest region though it is home to about 54 per cent of its population. Jammu and Ladakh have areas of 26,000sqkm and 65,000sqkm respectively, with a population share of 44 and two per cent.        
	Muslims are the majority in five of Jammus 10 districts. Of Ladakhs two districts, Muslims are the majority in one and Buddhists in the other.        
	Both the Jammu morcha and the Ladakh front, however, claim the support of Muslims from their regions.        
	In Leh district, the two premier Muslim bodies support us. We are trying to take the debate to Muslim-majority Kargil and have set up a unit in its Zanskar area, Chewang said.        
	The pro-trifurcation lobbies, however, have no takers among the major parties such as the National Conference, Peoples Democratic Party, Congress and the BJP.        
	The people of Jammu rejected the morchas politics in last years Assembly elections. The party won only one of the regions 37 seats. The people want a united Jammu and Kashmir, and we will not allow anybody to cause its disintegration, said Rattan Lal Gupta, president of the National Conferences Jammu unit.        
	The Jammu morcha and the Ladakh front, however, have the support of several Hindu Right-wing groups, including the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh which passed a resolution a few years ago seeking trifurcation.

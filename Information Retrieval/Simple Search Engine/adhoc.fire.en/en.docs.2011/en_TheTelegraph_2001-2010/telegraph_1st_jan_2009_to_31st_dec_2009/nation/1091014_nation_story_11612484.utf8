The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong, PC at odds on bullet-only Maoist plan   Leaders favour talks amp; development steps
                                                                                                               Cong, PC at odds on bullet-only Maoist plan     Leaders favour talks amp; development steps
          SANJAY K. JHA                          Chidambaram                                        
	New Delhi, Oct. 13: Home minister P. Chidambarams anti-Maoist strategy has triggered a churning within the Congress, with many senior leaders expressing concern over the impression that the government was pursuing a bullet-only policy.        
	These leaders want the government to send out a clear message that socio-economic measures and political negotiations were still the key aspects of the multi-pronged approach.        
	Although most leaders recognise the need for tougher police action, there is a high degree of unease over the public posturing on the impending military operation.        
	Some senior leaders have written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress president Sonia Gandhi, arguing in favour of a silent war that could have gone along with special development works and political initiatives.        
	These leaders, however, view as positive responses Rahul Gandhis assertion that the states inability to reach out to the people was the main reason for Naxalism, and Singhs recent comments that the government was ready for talks with the rebels and the army will not be used in operations.        
	The government cannot retrace its steps completely after this kind of a hype, a senior leader told The Telegraph, but the approach is definitely being nuanced.        
	A section of leaders feels that the action first, development later approach was inherently flawed.        
	You have to win over the people first. We must realise that the side which has the peoples support will ultimately win this battle. The Naxalites will all flee, leaving sympathisers, ordinary tribals and young boys and girls brainwashed by them to be killed. This will further alienate the tribal community. We should show them that the government cares, win them over and silently keep pushing the armed Naxalites to the brink, one leader said.        
	Some leaders have demanded a meeting of the Congress Working Committee to discuss the issue, arguing that such a politically sensitive matter cannot be decided by one minister and the bureaucracy. But there is no plan for calling a CWC as yet, probably because of the divergent views among senior leaders.        
	Sonia had set up a committee under Andhra Pradesh leader Sashidhar Reddy to study the Maoist problem during the UPAs first tenure but the report was never discussed at any forum. The committee had advocated a three-pronged approach  economic, political and maintenance of law and order  with emphasis on welfare programmes, construction of roads and bridges, education and healthcare in remote areas.         
	More important, the report asked for political initiatives by the Congress to spread the partys ideology in tribal areas on the lines of the work done by Sangh parivar outfits. It suggested opening of schools, shelters for the aged and dispensaries but nothing could be done.        
	Although Congress-led state governments undertook some welfare measures in remote areas and later implemented the rural job scheme, the party remained sluggish at the political level.         
	The government and political parties rarely reach out to tribals living in forests. The police go there some times but those interactions are not very pleasant. Unless this disconnect is addressed, the Naxalites cannot be defeated, said a Congress MP, demonstrating his disconnect with Chidambarams approach.

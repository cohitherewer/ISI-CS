The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Dossier to Pak with Saeed prod
                                                                                                               Dossier to Pak with Saeed prod
          JAYANTH JACOB                                    
	New Delhi, Aug. 1: India today handed its fifth dossier on the Mumbai terror attacks to Pakistan, emphasising the role of Jamat-ud-Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed in a nudge to Islamabad to prosecute him.        
	The move comes at a time the government, accused of a sellout after a joint Indo-Pak statement de-linked talks from action on terror, needs to be seen goading Islamabad to act against the 26/11 plotters.        
	The joint secretary of PAI (Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran) at the foreign ministry, T.C.A. Raghavan, handed over the seven-page dossier, with a detailed annexure of 60 pages, to Pakistan deputy high commissioner Rifat Masood.        
	Sources said the material contained detailed information about the investigation and legal evidence, particularly against Saeed and the Lashkar-e-Toiba  the earlier avatar of the Dawa.        
	Home minister P. Chidambaram told a news conference the dossier contained replies to routine queries I may say fill-in-the-blanks kind of questions from Pakistan.        
	Asked about Saeed, he said: There is enough evidence to continue the probe against Saeed.        
	Saeed, placed under house arrest in December after the UN blacklisted the Dawa, was released in June by Lahore High Court on the ground of lack of evidence. Islamabad has since then insisted that Saeed cannot be prosecuted because there is no evidence linking him to the Mumbai carnage.        
	Pakistan, in its July 12 dossier handed to India, had asked for certified copies of experts reports to establish that the gunmen who attacked Mumbai were in contact with their handlers in Pakistan.        
	Sources here said the dossier included transcripts containing evidence of live-time communication between the handlers and the gunmen, establishing the role of the Lashkar brass and Saeed.        
	Pakistans dossier had sought authenticated interrogation reports of two Indian suspects, Fahim Ansari and Sabahuddin. Islamabad also had a few questions about the legal process under way in Mumbai and these have been answered, the sources said.        
	Chidambaram said Pakistan had asked for information which is already there and asked for answers to questions which can easily be found if someone has read the CrPC (the criminal code). Nevertheless, I have taken the trouble of dictating the response.        
	India had earlier given dossiers to Pakistan on January 5, March 23, May 20 and June 20.        
	Foreign secretary Nirupama Rao, on her first day in charge of the foreign service, said: We will wait for Pakistan to examine the evidence and we expect a meaningful response from Pakistan.

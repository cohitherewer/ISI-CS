                                                                                                               Minority panel head calls for peace moves
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A riot victim points to her gutted home. (File picture)                                   
	Bhubaneswar, June 15: Vice-chairman of National Commission for Minorities (NCM) M.P. Pinto today said that the situation in Kandhamal had improved, but admitted that complete normality was yet to be restored in the riot-hit areas.        
	The situation has of course improved (in Kandhamal), but more steps to restore peace should be taken, Pinto told reporters after meeting the governor, the chief minister and senior government officials today.        
	The NCM vice-chairman, who visited the riot-hit areas earlier, said that more than 20,000 victims had fled home and taken shelter in relief camps. Though several have returned home, around 2,000 riot victims are still in the camps.         
	It is enough to say that complete normality is yet to be restored, he said.        
	It is the governments duty to ensure that not a single person feels the need to stay in the relief camp, said Pinto.        
	Asked if the commission will intervene in the matter of withdrawal of central paramilitary forces from Kandhamal, the vice-chairman said: We will make appropriate recommendation to the Centre for whatever may be required to restore peace in the district.         
	Pinto said the government had sanctioned Rs 25 lakh as compensation for churches damaged during the riot, which was the first of its kind in the country. Steps would be taken for the release of assistance for damaged churches or prayer houses located on disputed land, he added.        
	During the commissions two-day field visit, members of the minority community had alleged that many victims were yet to receive compensation in the absence of a proper list of those affected. They demanded fresh assessment of the damage caused during the violence.        
	The NCM vice-chairperson had visited Baliguda and Raikia blocks on Saturday and Sunday where he visited camps, met victims and spoke to both communities involved.        
	He also spoke with district officials, including district collector Krishan Kumar and police superintendent Pravin Kumar. After returning, Pinto met Governor M.C. Bhandare, chief minister Naveen Patnaik, chief secretary Ajit Kumar Tripathy and senior government officials.

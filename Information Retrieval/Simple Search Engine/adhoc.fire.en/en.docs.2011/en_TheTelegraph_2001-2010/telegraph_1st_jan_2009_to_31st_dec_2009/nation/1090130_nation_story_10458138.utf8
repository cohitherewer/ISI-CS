	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 29: The states chief postmaster-general, K.V. Sunderrajan, today announced the start of the second phase of Project Arrow today.        
	Thirty-five post offices (PO) have been selected for this phase.         
	During the first phase five POs in Chandbali, Puri, Gopalpur, Kamakhyanagar and Barpali were upgraded, while as many as 154 post offices have been selected for the technical makeover to be launched in the third phase expected to be completed by June 30, 2009. Conceived in April 2008 as a pilot project, the project aims to enhance the quality of service in core areas and upgrade the POs. The project will ensure that the offices become revenue positive in short while.

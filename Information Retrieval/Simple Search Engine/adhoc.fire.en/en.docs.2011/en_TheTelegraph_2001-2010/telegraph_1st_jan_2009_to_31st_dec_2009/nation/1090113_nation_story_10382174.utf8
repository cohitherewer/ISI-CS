The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Look beyond US: Karat 
                                                                                                               Look beyond US: Karat 
          JAYANTH JACOB                           Karat: UN, not US                                  
	Prakash Karat feels putting all the eggs in the US basket will not help Delhi bring the Mumbai attackers to book.        
	Admitting that his party needs to work hard in the coming Lok Sabha elections, the CPM general secretary spoke about campaigns the party would launch in February. Excerpts from a chat:        
	Q: How do you view Indias diplomatic offensive after the Mumbai attack and does it look like it will bring the desired results?         
	The government did not accept our suggestion to go to the UN. We would have pressed that Pakistan needs to act on various UN resolutions (like 1373) on terrorism to honour its international commitments. The government is putting all its eggs in the US basket. The co-operation with the CIA and the FBI are not good news as the US has different priorities in the region.         
	Q: But the government feels the US is the country that has maximum leverage with Pakistan, and it can get Islamabad to act?         
	The US priorities are different in the region and they dont play the role of a true mediator. They have the war on terror in Afghanistan and have to balance things. India cant replace Pakistan, the ally of the US, in this. President-elect Obama has already spoken about the priority his administration would give to Afghanistan. The US seems to have already said that those who are behind the Mumbai attacks from Pakistan can be tried in Pakistan. I dont think the US can get these people handed over to us.         
	Q: Do you in any way foresee a situation in which India will have to send troops to fight the war on terror in Afghanistan?         
	I dont think that any government can do that (send troops). It will create a situation like the one existing on the western border of Pakistan. We have been critical of the governments Afghan policy and explained it too.         
	Q: Considering that the US ambassador to India, David Mulford, has completed five years and his term would get over soon, have you ever met him or held any discussions?         
	No. I havent met any US ambassador.         
	Q: What about the campaigns ahead of the elections?         
	In February, the Left parties are taking up major campaigns. We will be focusing on the global economic crisis, the governments wrong policies and how differently they should have handled it. We will also highlight other issues, like foreign policy issues, including the Gaza situation. There will be a rally at the Maidan in Calcutta on February 8 by the Left. The Kerala state unit will be undertaking similar campaigns, too. We have, in fact, started such campaigns (Karat addressed a rally in Kanpur recently and his politburo colleague Sitaram Yechury in Calcutta).         
	Q: Are you expecting results like the last elections in the 2009 general election?         
	Last term, it was a different situation. For example, in Kerala, the Congress for the first time went without a single seat. (Of the 20 seats in the state, the Left won 19, while the Congress ally, the Indian Union Muslim League, won the other). But we will be putting our efforts everywhere.

	New Delhi, Nov. 14: Mizoram police apprehended six Myanmarese nationals, including five Chinese-origin criminals, in Aizawl last month.        
	A senior home ministry official today said they were criminals involved in illegal activities, although sources hinted there was more to it.        
	The police had picked up a Myanmarese and two Myanmarese of Chinese origin in the third week of October for crossing the border without passports or visas. They were sent back in the fourth week of October.        
	Around the same time, three Myanmarese of Chinese origin flew into Aizawl from Delhi. They did not have the restricted area permit mandatory for foreigners, and their visas had expired.         
	They were caught by the police, fined Rs 50 and let off when they said they had come to Aizawl on business.         
	The Union home ministry learnt of the incident and directed the police to apprehend them again. The three were re-arrested in end-October under the Foreigners Act and sent to judicial custody. The Centre sent an Intelligence Bureau team to Aizawl to question them.        
	Sources said the six were involved in cross-border smuggling via Moreh in Manipur and at least one had a contact in south India.         
	The five of Chinese origin hail from Ruili in Chinas Yunan province. Ruili borders Myanmars Muse town in Shan state.         
	The presence of foreigners is not uncommon in Mizoram. Before this, a retired US ranger was found conducting a workshop for Chin refugees in the state. The American, who had links with a pro-democracy NGO in Myanmar, was asked to leave.

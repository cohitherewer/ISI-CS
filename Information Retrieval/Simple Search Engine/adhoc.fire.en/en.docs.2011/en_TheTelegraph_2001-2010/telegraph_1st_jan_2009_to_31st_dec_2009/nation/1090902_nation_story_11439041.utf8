The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Yashwant for unity in poll battle
                                                                                                               Yashwant for unity in poll battle
          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                              
	Ranchi, Sept. 1: Setting aside his differences with the party, senior BJP leader Yashwant Sinha today announced that its leaders would put up a united fight in the Assembly elections in Maharashtra, Haryana and Arunachal Pradesh.        
	He also demanded that the state Assembly should be dissolved within 24 hours and the elections be held on October 13.        
	If the Centre refuses to accede to the demand, the party workers would take to the streets again. The partys core committee members would hold a meeting here on September 5 to finalise their action plans.         
	Meanwhile, the BJPs Jharkhand Bachao Jagaran Yatra had already begun in different districts. Sinha himself will lead the campaign in Hazaribagh district from tomorrow.        
	Referring to home minister P. Chidambarams submissions in both Houses of Parliament that Assembly elections in Jharkhand would be held along with the three states, Sinha alleged that the UPA was playing cruel joke on Jharkhand. He also ridiculed Governor K. Sankaranarayanans public statement that election process here would begin by the end of this year.         
	Yesterday, the Election Commission said that polls in three states would be held on October 13. In case of Jharkhand, if formal announcements are made in December-end, when would the elections be held? In any case, a duly elected government has to be formed here latest by January 19, when the tenure of second term of Presidents rule ends, Sinha said soon after his arrival from New Delhi.        
	He demanded that the Prime Minister should immediately convene a cabinet meeting and dissolve the Assembly, so that elections here can be held with three states. Still, there are fair chances, which should not be wasted, Sinha added.        
	Replying to another question, he said that the BJP has always been advocating early elections. Its senior leaders were often beaten up by the police while staging protests. If a politician of my stature is being beaten up on streets, it is not an ordinary thing, he said.        
	He alleged that governance in Jharkhand was worse when former Governor Syed Sibtey Razi was sitting at the helm of affairs. It was even worse than the governments run by Madhu Koda and Shibu Soren. The UPA cant hide Razis misdeeds. Sankaranarayanan, too, has proved to be ineffective, he added.        
	He, however, parried questions involving infighting within the BJP, including his own differences with the party bigwigs. But he argued that the BJP was intact and during war, mutual differences of individuals automatically lost significance. I am a dedicated soldier of the BJP. I did raise certain issues and I am happy that those points have been noted. I dont want to comment more, said Sinha.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chennai, Dec. 23: The ruling DMK today won two Assembly seats in contests dubbed biryani bypolls because of the goodies showered on voters, extending the partys unbroken run of success in all such elections since 2006.        
	The result is a personal blow to ADMK chief Jayalalithaa who campaigned this time, unlike in some bypolls earlier this year. But she couldnt blunt the ruling partys advantage.        
	The DMK-led front has so far recorded nine wins. The tally will rise to 10 if it bags another seat where bypolls are to be held on January 20.        
	The party retained the Vandavasi seat in north Tamil Nadu by over 38,000 votes and wrested Tiruchendur in the south from the ADMK with a margin of 46,000 votes.        
	The December 19 election had come to be known as the biryani bypolls  voters were handed biryani packets during the campaigns. Usual baits like liquor, money, clothes and even mobile recharge cards were there too, but biryanis set a new trend of wooing voters through their stomachs.

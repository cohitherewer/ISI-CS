The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Govt armed with Esma, strike still on
                                                                                                               Govt armed with Esma, strike still on
          OUR BUREAU      
	Oct. 5: The state government today enforced the Essential Service Maintenance Act (Esma) against striking private bus operators after talks to resolve the deadlock failed.        
	Esma has been invoked today against the private bus operators who are on strike, chief minister Naveen Patnaik told reporters here this afternoon.        
	Observing that the bus strike had inconvenienced millions, Naveen said: This will not be allowed to continue.        
	As per the Esma provisions, the state government can empower the district collectors to seize private buses and run these for public use. If any bus owners create any obstacle, they are liable for arrest.        
	Decrying the government action, the Orissa Private Bus Owners Association spokesman, Debasis Nayak, said: The government has unlimited power. But seizure and arrests will not serve the purpose.        
	The bus owners demand that the Centre should withdraw toll tax imposed by the National Highways Authority of India or the state bears the tax burden.        
	However, the state did no agree to this. Its not proper for state government to bear the burden of tax imposed by the Centre, said transport secretary P.K. Jena.         
	But the bus owners cant see any logic behind this. Bearing a burden of Rs 4 crore for public interest is not a big thing for the government, said Nayak.        
	Thousands of people were today seen stranded at bus stands across the state. At the waiting room of the Orissa State Road Transport Corporations bus terminus at Badambadi, Sadasiv Das (60) sat preoccupied trying to find a way to return home in Deogarh, some 200km away.        
	I dont know what to do. There is no ticket to get on an OSRTC bus on the Cuttack-Deogarh route, said the retired government servant.        
	For Ranju Rani Sahu (40), getting a bus to reach his husband at Lanjigarh, nearly 500km away in Kalhandi, had turned into an excruciating exercise.         
	Bus services had been badly hit, as the OSRTC has just 33 buses  in contrast to 700-odd private buses  to tackle the situation in Cuttack.

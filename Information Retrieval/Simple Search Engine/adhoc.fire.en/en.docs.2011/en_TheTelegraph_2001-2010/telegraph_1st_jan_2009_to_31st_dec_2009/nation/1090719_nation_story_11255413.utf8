The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | MP out of job? Fight civic elections 
                                                                                                               MP out of job? Fight civic elections 
          BASANT RAWAT                           Narendra Modi                                  
	Ahmedabad, July 18: Back to basics for Narendra Modis brigade.        
	The Gujarat chief minister has asked two former Junagadh MPs  one a former Union minister who had been elected five times and the other a three-time Lok Sabha member who has also been a state minister  to contest the civic elections in Junagadh tomorrow so they can gain experience.         
	Bhavna Chikhaliya, 54, who was a Union minister in the Vajpayee government, and Mohan Patel, who was elected three times from the constituency in the eighties, will contest the Junagadh Municipal Corporation elections in a move that is said to be the brainchild of Modi.        
	If the BJP retains power in the civic body, Chikhaliya and Patel could end up becoming members of the garden and drainage committees.         
	Gujarat BJP spokesperson Vijay Rupani termed this a new beginning, a bold idea and experiment which will take off in Junagadh.         
	For Chikhaliya, who has been in the political wilderness after losing the 2004 elections, the civic polls could be a step towards reinstatement in the party set-up. The former MPs claim they are comfortable with the idea. We are bound by party discipline. The party has directed us to contest civic elections; so we have no problem, said Chikhaliya.        
	Patel, who has been state irrigation minister, said that though he was 77, he was physically fit to make a difference in Junagadh city. Im contesting because the chief minister wants to utilise my experience and expertise for developing the city, he said.        
	Chikhaliya, who was denied a Lok Sabha ticket this year, said the visionary chief minister wanted to develop Junagadh as a major centre of tourism. Considering my background in the tourism ministry, Modi has asked me to contest the civic body election and help preserve several monuments, the holy shrine of Girnar and Asiatic lions in Junagadh, said Chikhaliya.         
	Supporters of Modi defended the move, saying if Darshanben Jardosh, a Surat councillor, could be fielded in the Lok Sabha elections from the diamond city, why could former MPs and ministers not become councillors in the interest of urban development?        
	But Modis critics said that though the BJP candidate from Junagadh had won the Lok Sabha election, the BJPs vote share had shrunk in nine of the citys 17 wards. So a worried Modi had chosen to field former MPs, a sitting MLA and prominent citizens to ensure that they garnered votes, said Sunil Oza, a former BJP MLA.

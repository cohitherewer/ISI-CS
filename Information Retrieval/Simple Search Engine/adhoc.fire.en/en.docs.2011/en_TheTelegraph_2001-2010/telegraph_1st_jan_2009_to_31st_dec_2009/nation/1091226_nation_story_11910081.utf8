          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, Dec. 25: The Telangana lobby today gave the Centre and the Congress high command time till Monday to announce a time frame for beginning the process of statehood.         
	The Monday deadline was set by the Telangana Ikya Vedika, the Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS)-led forum that includes the Congress and the Prajya Rajyam Party leaders.        
	The group hardened its stance despite apparent cracks in the Telangana front: the Telugu Desam Party today floated its own statehood axis, Telangana Sadhana Samiti (TSS), as a counter-weight to the Ikya Vedika.        
	The TSS even chose as its convener Desam MLA N. Janardhan Reddy, who was beaten up by Osmania University students yesterday. Reddy, who got an apology today, appealed to youths and women to rally around the TSS, saying neither the Congress nor the TRS led by K. Chandrasekhar Rao could be trusted.        
	How can we trust the Congress which has been dilly dallying on the issue since 2004 and changed its tune within 15 days, he said, referring to the Centres initial announcement to start the process and its December 23 assertion to hold more talks.        
	The heightened statehood politics came even as the quit parade of state ministers and MLAs continued. Today, four CPI legislators tendered their resignation.         
	The Left party has already joined the Ikya Samiti after severing links with the Desam, with which it had fought this years polls.        
	Within the Congress, the turbulence continued. The Telangana ministers  including home minister Sabita Reddy  told chief minister K. Rosaiah they had faxed their joint resignation letter to Sonia Gandhi and would meet her soon.         
	TRS chief Rao said there would be no bandhs till Tuesday, but dharnas, fasts and demonstrations will continue without violence.        
	State officials sought more central forces at a meeting with Union cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar here to review the situation arising out the agitation.

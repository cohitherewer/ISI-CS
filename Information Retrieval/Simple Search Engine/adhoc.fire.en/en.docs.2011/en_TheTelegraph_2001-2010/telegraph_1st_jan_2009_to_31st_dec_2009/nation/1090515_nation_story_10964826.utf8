The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hermit Lalu avoids media
                                                                                                               Hermit Lalu avoids media
          NALIN VERMA                          Feeling the heat?                                  
	Patna, May 14: An otherwise voluble Lalu Prasad is turning out to be a better listener these days.        
	Clad in his trademark lungi and vest, the RJD boss was today seen listening patiently to what his workers, who had gathered at his Patna residence by 9am, had to say. The leader quizzed the workers about voting trends, then fell silent as he listened to their tales  booth by booth.         
	In between he sipped lemon tea and had his raw tobacco, occasionally muttering: Do not allow the electronic media in. I will speak to them only after May 16 when the results are out.         
	The railway minister is said to be peeved by the media predictions regarding the demise of the RJD and gains of the NDA in Bihar. He does not agree with the pre-poll surveys which are by and large predicting a doom for Lalu.         
	These are the same reporters who had made A.B. Vajpayee a Prime Minister before the results were out in 2004. Where is Vajpayeeji? he asks.        
	When a worker from Sonepur, (in Saran Lok Sabha constituency where Lalu is a candidate) said: Sirji, our party has polled more than 70 per cent of votes in Sonepur segment of Saran. We have carried out booth analysis, Lalu seemed unmoved and preferred to listen to another cadre from Vaishali.        
	The RLD-LJP combination alone will win at least 25 out of 40 Bihar seats. It will be hard for Nitish and the BJP leaders basking in the media glory to show their face after the results, he said. But, his voice could barely be heard.        
	The RJD boss remained cautious while talking about his dialogue with Sonia Gandhi that happened yesterday. Why should I reveal what we discussed. All will be known after May 16.        
	Lalu aides who were more forthcoming than their boss later revealed that the Congress president called Lalu to ask for his support in forming a coalition government. Lalu gave his consent.         
	Earlier, Lalu lost his cool when a news channel tried to show the leader entering his poll booth on May 7 in the Patna Saheb constituency. He had briskly commanded his securitymen to drive the cameramen out of the station.         
	Since then he has been avoiding the media. Insiders say that Lalu Prasad has not been watching much of television news either. Only his workers and family are allowed to brief, while he stays engrossed in interacting with the workers who gather in hordes at his house every morning.        
	Asked if he will go to New Delhi, he simply said: Let us see. I have not decided yet. Let the results come out, adding: But what is sure that my party will do far better than the projections by the media.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 5: The Assembly today unanimously adopted a resolution agreeing to the clauses of the Orissa (alteration of name) Bill, 2009, prepared by the Centre for introduction in Parliament for replacing the word Orissa by Odisha.        
	The Assembly also authorised the state government to place the matter before the Centre for further necessary action.        
	Though Odisha was made a separate province in 1936 on linguistic basis, the states name had been erroneously mentioned in Schedule I of the Constitution as Orissa in English and Udisa in Hindi. The states language was mentioned as Oriya in English and Udia in Hindi.        
	On August 28 last year, a resolution seeking the amendment had been adopted in the state Assembly and forwarded to the Centre to pass a bill in Parliament.        
	The President recently referred the bill to the Assembly for expressing its views thereon.

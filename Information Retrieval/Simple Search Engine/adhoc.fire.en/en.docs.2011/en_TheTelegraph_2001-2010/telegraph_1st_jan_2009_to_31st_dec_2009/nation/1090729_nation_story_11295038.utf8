The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Blacklist notice to Gammon
                                                                                                               Blacklist notice to Gammon
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 28: Gammon India, the Delhi Metro contractor that built the faulty girder whose collapse killed six workers, was today served a blacklist show-cause for future projects, but will continue with the existing job.        
	The right thing to do would be to pack them off right away, but we need them. There are no contractors who can take their place. What we can do is to maintain higher level of quality and double-check designs by an independent design office, Metro chief E. Sreedharan said after an independent probe found Gammons faulty design and materials responsible for the July 12 accident.        
	Delhi Metro has suspended two of its engineers who cleared the design and sent back Vijay Anand, the director overseeing the Lajpat Nagar area where the accident occurred, to the railways. Anand was on deputation.         
	Gammon, which declined comment saying it needed to go through the probe report, has 21 days to reply. But Sreedharan said the Mumbai firm, handling projects worth Rs 300 crore now, would be shut out of bidding for the next stage. Gammon will not be part of Phase III. We will issue tenders for contractors and even look for foreign companies, the Metro chief said.         
	The Metro has already given the Delhi government a blueprint for the new phase, spanning 120km, for approval.         
	Arch Consultancy Services, the girders designer, has been blacklisted for five years. Another has been barred for two years for not giving correct advice.         
	Urban development minister S. Jaipal Reddy backed Sreedharan. The DMRC has taken 10 steps to ensure such incidents dont recur, he said. The steps include a safety course for workers and closer scan on piers. Yesterday, cracks were detected in 18 pillars.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 4: The Supreme Court today stayed two orders by the Central Information Commission directing the court registry to share information on judges appointments and an attempt to influence a judge within 15 days with an RTI applicant.         
	Delhi-based cloth merchant Subhash Aggarwal had sought the information from the courts executive wing and had been turned down twice. He had then appealed to the commission, which ruled in his favour on November 24.         
	The CICs twin orders had caused much anxiety in the office of the chief justice, which has been opposed to sharing such information on the ground that it would impinge on the courts independence.         
	Aggarwal had sought copies of the correspondence between constitutional authorities  such as the chief justice, the law minister and the Prime Ministers Office  on the recent elevation of some judges to the top court bypassing senior claimants. He also wanted details of an alleged bid by a minister to influence a Madras High Court judge.        
	Within days of the CIC order, the courts central public information officer had challenged it in the apex court itself.         
	Before this, when the CIC had ordered sharing of information on whether judges filed their assets with the Chief Justice of India, the court registry had appealed to Delhi High Court.         
	The high court had ruled against the registry, saying the details should be given out so the judiciary was seen to be transparent. It had also held that the Chief Justice of Indias office was a public authority and information held by his office came under the sweep of the RTI.         
	The registry then moved a division bench against the single judges order. The appeal is pending.        
	Faced with the adverse order, the registry this time chose to go directly to the apex court.        
	Appearing for the apex court registry today, attorney general G.E. Vahanvati said the CICs orders would have to be heard and considered at length in view of its implications.         
	However, Aggarwals lawyer Prashant Bhushan urged the court to make the disclosures. This must be done quickly as an impression is being created that the court by opposing the principle of the RTI was backtracking.

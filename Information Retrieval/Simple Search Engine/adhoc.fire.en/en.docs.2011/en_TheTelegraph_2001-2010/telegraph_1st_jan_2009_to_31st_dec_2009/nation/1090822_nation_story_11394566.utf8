	New Delhi, Aug. 21: Army chief General Deepak Kapoor will attend the US-sponsored three-day Pacific Armies Chiefs Conference (PACC) in Tokyo from August 24.        
	The conference is primarily a networking event with time marked out for shopping, visits to museums and a US military base but the chiefs also hold bilateral discussions.        
	The Pacific Armies Chiefs Conference VI in Tokyo has as its theme International Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief in Natural and Human-induced Disasters.        
	For PACC-VI, army chiefs of 31 countries in the Asia-Pacific region have been invited. The US is co-hosting the event with Japan.        
	These conferences are intended to foster enhanced military-to-military co-operation, develop interpersonal relationship and contribute significantly to regional dialogue and security. The conference will also promote cooperation and better understanding among regional armies, an army statement released today said.        
	The release said General Kapoor would have bilateral meetings with many other chiefs. Army sources said the discussions with other chiefs would be on issues of mutual interest, specially the ongoing defence co-operation engagements and regional security in the Asia Pacific region.        
	The multilateral discussions would focus onthe role that land forces should play in civil-military cooperation and issues to build international cooperation in disaster relief operations.

	New Delhi, May 17: Manmohan Singh may not believe in astrology but there are enough people in his party who want him to take the oath of office next Friday.        
	Apparently, May 22 is not only the fifth anniversary of the day Singh became Prime Minister for the first time and so auspicious for him  but also a good day according to celestial alignments.        
	Under the tentative timetable being worked out by the party, Singh will be elected leader of the Congress parliamentary party around 11am on May 19 (while Sonia Gandhi continues as CPP chairperson). Those astrologically inclined among Congress leaders claim that the planetary movements on Tuesday would be propitious till about 12.30pm.        
	Singh will then have the choice of being sworn in on May 20 or any subsequent day. Congress leaders, however, said it would have to be either May 20 or May 22. May 21 is Martyrs Day, the death anniversary of Rajiv Gandhi, so it is being ruled out.        
	Sources said the swearing-in would be followed by a dinner for the new ministers and ruling alliance leaders. If Singh and Sonia accept the advice of the Congresss Uttar Pradesh MPs, Amar Singh is unlikely to be among the guests.        
	Teams of newly elected Lok Sabha members arrived in Delhi and called on Sonia through the day, the most upbeat of the contingents being the one from the heartland state.        
	The MPs urged Sonia and Singh to keep the Samajwadis out of the new government. Any truck with Mulayam Singh Yadav, they said, would hobble the Congresss revival plans in Uttar Pradesh.        
	A similar sentiment was expressed about Lalu Prasad although the Congress has only two MPs from Bihar.        
	The MPs from Uttar Pradesh, which gave the party a surprise tally of 21 seats, thanked Rahul Gandhi and Sonia for their foresight.        
	A young MP was heard recalling how he and many others had initially lobbied for a Samajwadi alliance. But your foresight saved the day for us. You are rich in wisdom while we are poor in understanding, the MP told Sonia.        
	Foresight was shown also by the chefs and stewards from the governments ITDC-run Ashoka Hotel who today provided the catering at 24 Akbar Road. The Congresss national headquarters, normally deserted on Sundays, bustled with activity today.        
	Most office-bearers arrived early in the morning and stayed back till late in the evening on a stiflingly hot day. The smartly dressed stewards, who hurried about with bottles of mineral water and food packets for Union ministers and party general secretaries, seemed to have known that the office has no refrigerator. They brought huge slabs of ice to keep the bottles chilled through the day.

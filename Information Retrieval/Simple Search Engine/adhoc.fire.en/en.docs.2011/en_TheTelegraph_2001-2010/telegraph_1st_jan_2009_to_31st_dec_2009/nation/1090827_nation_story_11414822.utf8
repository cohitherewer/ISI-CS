          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           Sibal                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 26: Education minister Kapil Sibal has vetoed a two-year-old plan to dismantle Indias apex teacher education regulator accused of allowing sub-standard training colleges to flourish under its watch.        
	Top government officials said the minister had extended the life of the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE), but with fewer powers.         
	Sibal, the officials told The Telegraph, has rejected a ministry plan to disband the NCTE by repealing a law that created the teacher body, top government officials told The Telegraph.         
	The ministry will convey to the cabinet secretariat its decision to withdraw the NCTE (repeal) bill it had drafted after a review panel under late education secretary Sudip Banerjee recommended that the body be dissolved.         
	Instead of dismantling the teacher body, the ministry would now amend the powers of the council and hand over its key regulatory powers to individual universities, sources said. The NCTE will not be dissolved. But the ministers decision does not mean that the ministry is happy with the functioning of the body, a source said.         
	The council has been responsible both for setting and enforcing standards that must be followed by teacher training institutions.         
	The body has, however, been frequently criticised for its inability to regulate flourishing institutions imparting teacher training courses in violation of its rules and standards.         
	Its failure to stop such institutions from fooling students into joining classes has repeatedly thrust a dilemma on to the ministry  whether it should accept illegal degrees to save careers, or enforce rules stringently.         
	The latest such case involves Bengal, where Calcutta High Court struck down the legality of hundreds of teacher training institutes offering courses without recognition from the teacher education regulator.         
	The councils rules require primary school teacher training courses to be at least two years long. But most of the Bengal institutes declared illegal offered courses of shorter duration. A panel under Banerjee, the then higher education secretary, in early 2007 recommended scrapping the teacher body and replacing it with a new, stronger, teacher education regulatory structure.         
	The ministry, on the basis of the panels recommendations drafted a bill to repeal the NCTE act that governs the teacher education regulator.         
	The repeal bill was even approved by the cabinet and was awaiting nod from Parliament.         
	Now, Sibal is learnt to have suggested that instead of dismantling the teacher education regulator, the bodys powers be amended to realistically match its abilities to regulate teacher education across the country.         
	The council may be allowed to continue setting standards for teacher education  adopting a role similar to that of the National Council for Education Research and Training in school education. The NCERT sets standards for curriculum and publishes textbooks used across central schools and many private schools.

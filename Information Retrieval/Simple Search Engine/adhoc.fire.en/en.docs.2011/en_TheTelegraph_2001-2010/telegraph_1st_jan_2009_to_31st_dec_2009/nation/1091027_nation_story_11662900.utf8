          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                                    
	New Delhi, Oct. 26: The Supreme Court has scrapped a paternity test on a child in a divorce case, saying it couldnt be ordered just because the husband who had made it a prestige issue wanted to consider the possibility of a patch-up.        
	The October 22 order came on a wifes petition against a Madhya Pradesh High Court ruling last year that had granted her husband Bharatrams request for a DNA test after a lower court had thrown out his divorce plea.        
	A two-judge bench of the apex court said the high court wasnt justified in allowing the test only on the ground that there will be a possibility of re-union if the test proved that the son was born of the marriage.        
	Ramkanya Bai and Bharatram had married in April 1999. Her husband started harassing her soon and eventually turned her out in 2004. He then filed for divorce in the court of the additional district and sessions judge, Mandsor.        
	In November 2004, a child was born to the couple. Ramkanya and Bharatram both appeared before the trial court. In December 2006, the court dismissed Bharatrams plea for divorce.         
	Bharatram then moved the Indore bench of the high court. While the case was pending, he filed an application for the DNA test, saying the child could not have been born of their marriage.        
	Ramkanya objected, saying her husband had not denied the childs paternity in the lower court. But the high court ruled in Bharatrams favour and granted permission for the DNA test.        
	The high court said the appellant (the husband) had made it a prestige issue and it appeared that if the DNA test found that the son of the respondent (the wife) is from the appellant, the family can be re-united.        
	But the Supreme Court said it was unable to accept the high court order.        
	In (the) absence of any reason except on the ground that the husband had made a prestige issue about the paternity of the child, nothing could be found from the order of the high court which could invite the court to allow such (an) application (for a DNA test), Justices Tarun Chatterjee and R.M. Lodha said.         
	The court added that it would also be evident from the application that there was no allegation by the husband that as a consequence of illicit relationship with some third person, the child was born to the wife.        
	The apex court also noted that under Indian law, a child was presumed to be legitimate. This presumption, the bench said, largely depends on the fact that parties to a marriage have necessary access to each other when a divorce petition is filed and specially when the husband did not assert that the son was a consequence of illicit relationship with some third person.        
	So the high court couldnt order a DNA test only because of the mere desire of the husband to deny paternity, the apex court said.

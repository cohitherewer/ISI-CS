                                                                                                               100-day House plan
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 24: The parliamentary affairs ministry has got its own 100-day plan of action while the BJP has been denied its two-day plan of inaction.        
	Sonia Gandhi has told the government that MPs should sit for at least 100 days a year, restoring to Parliament its importance that was being eroded by the spate in adjournments. In the Good Old Days, Parliament would conduct business at least 120 days a year, a figure that has fallen to a little over 60 days.        
	So, when BJP members informally sounded out the government on pruning this session by two days, they were politely refused. Sources said some BJP members had proposed that since the Houses would function for just two days after the August 5 Raksha Bandhan holiday, they found it pointless to return from their constituencies.        
	Leader of the Lok Sabha Pranab Mukherjee then hosted a lunch to sound out leaders of the UPA, its supporters and the Opposition. The DMK and ADMK members rejected the suggestion, saying the southern states didnt celebrate Raksha Bandhan.        
	The BJP, which has sworn not to obstruct proceedings to try and correct its image, gave in without ado.        
	With Sonia keen that Parliament have enough business to keep the MPs in their seats, the parliamentary ministers and strategists have lined up work to last till August 7. The Lok Sabha will pass the finance bill on July 27 and the Rajya Sabha the following day.        
	MPs will then debate the issues arising from the Prime Ministers recent foreign trips, and discuss the uneven rainfall and education reforms. The government has also agreed to a discussion on certain television reality shows, branded scurrilous by some MPs.        
	Two bills have to be passed: on the right to education (by the Lok Sabha) and an amendment to the Rubber Act 1947.        
	The Centre also plans to table land acquisition and relief-and-rehabilitation bills.        
	All eyes, however, are on the foreign policy discussions, particularly on the India-Pakistan joint statement.

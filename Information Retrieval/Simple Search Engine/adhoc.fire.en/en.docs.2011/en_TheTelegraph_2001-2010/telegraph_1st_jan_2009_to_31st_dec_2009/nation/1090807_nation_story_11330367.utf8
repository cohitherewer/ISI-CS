The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Advani sees surrender
                                                                                                               Advani sees surrender
          SANJAY K. JHA                                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 6: L.K. Advani today accused the Prime Minister of having been less than honest on the Sharm-el-Sheikh joint statement, and alleged the Centre might now settle the Kashmir dispute by compromising on Indias interests.        
	There is widespread suspicion that the joint statement is a curtain-raiser to the UPA governments surrender to Pakistan on the Kashmir issue under external pressure, Advani said.        
	The government seems inclined to settle the Kashmir issue in blatant violation of the unanimous resolution by Parliament in 1995. The country must be vigilant.        
	He dismissed all defence of the Indo-Pak joint statement by ministers and Congress leaders as verbal gymnastics and asked the government to either promise to erase that mistake or come clean on how it planned to normalise relations with Pakistan.         
	The main contention of Advanis speech, at a function in Delhi, however, was that the BJP was not anti-Muslim. He even cited wife Kamlas respect for Sufi traditions.

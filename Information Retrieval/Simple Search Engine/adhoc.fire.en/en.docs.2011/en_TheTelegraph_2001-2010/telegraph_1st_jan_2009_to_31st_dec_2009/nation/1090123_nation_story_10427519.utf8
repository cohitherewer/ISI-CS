          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 22: Orissa, which has tremendous tourism potential, lags far behind other states in building proper infrastructure for visitors, said Hotel amp; Restaurant Association of Orissa chairman J.K. Mohanty.        
	Mohanty said that during the past four years there had been a boom in the tourism industry, thanks to the Incredible India campaign, launched by the Centre. The campaign had attracted large number of foreign tourists and the number was expected to grow further which calls for building up sufficient infrastructure.        
	However, Orissa could not take advantage of the campaign and failed to match Maharashtra, Goa and other states in putting up tourist infrastructure, he said.        
	In order to cope with the emerging challenges, almost every state is coming up with more than 5,000 hotel rooms on an average. Airports in different states are being expanded and renovated to accommodate the increasing traffic. But Orissa is lagging far behind, he added.        
	Only 158 rooms are under construction in Orissa, while more than 70,000 rooms are being built across the country. The state was also still not open for international operation, he said. As a result, Orissa could not avail the subsidy of Rs 3 lakh per hotel room, Mohanty rued.        
	The state, which has attracted investment to the tune of Rs 6 lakh crore in steel and allied sectors, should rope in investors for building up tourism infrastructure, he said.        
	In order to build up infrastructure to attract foreign tourists, Orissa needs an investment of at least Rs 1,100 core during the next five years (2,000 rooms of three-star category with an investment of Rs 600 crore and another 500 rooms of five-star category with an investment of Rs 500 crore). Additional 2,500 rooms would provide direct and indirect employment to 25,000 persons and generate income of Rs 2,500 crore, he said.

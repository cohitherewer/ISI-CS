                                                                                                               Mayavati cops slap NSA on eve-teasers
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, May 30: Eve-teasers beware, next time you harass a girl on the street you can be branded a threat to the nation.        
	Kanpur police have booked three men under the national security act (NSA) for harassing two college girls, months after a legal fiasco over slapping the law against BJP MP Varun Gandhi for an alleged hate speech.        
	Sources said normally, eve-teasers are booked under the penal code, but explained that the police might have wanted to set an example after Tuesdays incident as the city, Uttar Pradeshs largest, was fast becoming unsafe for women.        
	The NSA is invoked in cases in which social unrest has been set off by teasing, said a police officer, adding that since January, violence had broken out in the industrial city over nine such incidents.         
	Earlier in March, the Mayavati administration had invoked the NSA against Varun for his alleged anti-Muslim speech in Pilibhit.        
	Varun, now Pilibhit MP, is alleged to have said at an election rally that if anyone lifted a hand against Hindus, he would cut off that hand.         
	The Supreme Court later revoked the charges slapped under the NSA against Varun, but not before the young poll debutant had to cool his heels in jail for nearly three weeks on election-eve.        
	A police inspector said the arrested trio, identified as Rishi, Sachin and Amit  all in their mid-twenties and allegedly drunk  began teasing the girls verbally first in Kanpurs Harvansh Mahal area.        
	Then they became physical, tearing apart a portion of the dress of one of them (the girls), the officer added.        
	When the brother of one of the girls protested, he was slapped. Bystanders and residents then intervened and beat up the three before handing them over to the police.        
	To invoke the NSA, the police have to approach the district magistrate under a proper procedure laid down in the act, Kanpur deputy inspector-general Hari Ram Sharma told reporters.        
	A case was forwarded to the district magistrate to invoke the NSA on May 27 against the three. On the district magistrates order, the NSA was registered against the three today.        
	Legal opinion is, however, against invoking the NSA against eve-teasers.        
	The act was passed to help the police have a grip on an abnormal kind of law and order situation, said Manoj Singh, an Allahabad High Court advocate.

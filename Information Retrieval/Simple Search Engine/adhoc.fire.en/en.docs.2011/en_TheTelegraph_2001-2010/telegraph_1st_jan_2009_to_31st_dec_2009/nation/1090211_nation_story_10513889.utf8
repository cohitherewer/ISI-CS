	Dehri-on-Son, Feb. 10: Sonia Gandhi used a railway function set up by none other than Lalu Prasad to launch the UPAs election campaign in the region today and took off on the BJP for bringing the Ram temple issue back on centrestage.        
	Satta ki sirhiyan chadhne ke liye ye log Bhagwan ka sahara lete hain (These people take the name of God to ride the ladder of power, the Congress president said, describing the saffron partys act as bahut bara dhokha (downright fraud) on the people.        
	Explaining the ideal of religion amid thunderous applause from the crowd, Sonia said: God lives in our heart. Religion means individuals faith in the almighty. All regions are equal and people must respect all faiths. Countrymen belonging to different faiths must stay united.        
	Making it virtually clear that the UPA would showcase Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs succesfull tenure during campaign rallies, Sonia said: The country has made all-round development under the stewardship of Singh. It is the Singh government, which has empowered the electorate to know how the leaders elected by them have been performing by making the Right to Information Act effective.        
	Earlier, Sonia laid the foundation stone of the dedicated eastern freight corridor in the presence of railway minister Lalu, his wife and Opposition leader in the Bihar Assembly Rabri Devi, Bihar Congress chief Anil Sharma, besides a dozen senior state and central UPA leaders and ministers.        
	However, the UPA chairpersons speech dwelt more on explaining how the BJPs stand was counter-productive to curbing terrorism, which she described as the biggest menace for the nation. I passionately appeal you to stay united. Maintain social and communal harmony.        
	Sonia  often deviating from her written speech and breaking into Hindi  virtually projected Lalu Prasad as the UPAs star campaigner in the region by praising his work as railway minister. Lalu Prasad has proved beyond all doubt that a government establishment can be made immensely profitable. He has created history by turning the railways into a profit-making establishment.

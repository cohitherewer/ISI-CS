                                                                                                               Bihar model to train girls 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 29: Bihar today, India tomorrow.        
	The Centre plans to extend across the country a Bihar scheme started last year for Muslim girls, impressed by its success in the state.        
	Government officials said the human resource development ministry was thinking of starting Hunar  a centrally assisted scheme aimed at providing job-oriented vocational training  in every state.         
	The scheme is at present a joint project of the Bihar government and the centrally run National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS).        
	The ministrys plan to take the scheme beyond Bihar is likely to be announced to the countrys largest education advisory body, the Central Advisory Board on Education, at a meeting on Monday, sources said.         
	Over 12,000 girls completed vocational courses under the scheme in Bihar this year, and the state has set a target of enrolling 50,000 students for the second year.         
	Although the NIOS provides the course content and even assisted the project financially, it is the states Janata Dal (United)-BJP regime that benefited enormously, officials in Delhi said.        
	Chief minister Nitish Kumar managed to personally associate himself with the scheme and showcase it as a programme of the Bihar government, a senior official added.        
	Under the scheme, students go through a year-long training programme for a vocational stream they choose such as sewing, weaving, knitting, child and maternity care, or computers.        
	At the end of the training, they have to take a test conducted by the NIOS. Students who clear the test get a certificate and a grant of Rs 25,000 to buy tools  a sewing machine, for instance, for those who chose sewing  to pursue the vocation of their choice.        
	This year, Nitish personally handed passbooks to each successful student so they could access bank accounts his government started in their names with the Rs 25,000 grant.         
	At Mondays meeting, the HRD ministry will also announce several new measures, including a decision to set up 374 promised model colleges in blocks with a high density of Muslim, Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe students.

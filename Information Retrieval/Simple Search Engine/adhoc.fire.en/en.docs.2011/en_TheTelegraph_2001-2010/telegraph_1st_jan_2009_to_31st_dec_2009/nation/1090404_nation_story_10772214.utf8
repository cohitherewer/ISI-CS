The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Candidates must tell all in poll papers
                                                                                                               Candidates must tell all in poll papers
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, April 3: Candidates filing nomination for the general election will no longer be able to withhold crucial information such as educational qualifications, financial status and criminal antecedents.        
	The Supreme Court has directed the Election Commission to ensure that candidates compulsorily fill up these columns in nomination forms.        
	The directive came yesterday after the commission claimed candidates were increasingly leaving them blank, thereby frustrating voters right to information about them.        
	Commission counsel Meenakshi Arora said the panel was unable to take action against such candidates. Technically, candidates do not infringe upon any law when they leave the columns blank.        
	Arora said the commission had, however, begun insisting that candidates at least write not applicable or nil in the columns. In that case, it would still be able to prosecute them for committing perjury by lying under oath.        
	The court was hearing a year-old petition  filed by Punjab-based civil rights group Resurgence India  complaining that candidates were taking advantage of loopholes in electoral laws and leaving the columns blank.        
	Under existing laws, candidates have to give affidavits stating their educational qualifications, assets and liabilities and criminal background, if any. Initially, returning officers could reject nomination papers for giving false or incomplete information or substantially suppressing it.        
	But later the apex court clarified that the poll panel could only insist on the information but could not summarily reject such papers during scrutiny.        
	Arguing for intervention, senior counsel Prashant Bhushan told the court Resurgence India had analysed 7,000 nomination papers filed during the 2007 Punjab polls and found crucial columns blank.        
	The fear of being charged with perjury for lying under oath was increasingly prompting candidates to leave these columns blank, he said.        
	This had made the Election Commissions task of rejecting nomination papers or taking action against such candidates tougher, he argued.        
	The petition had sought specific directives to give effect to the right of voters to know about the antecedents of candidates contesting elections.        
	The aforesaid right to know the antecedents of the candidates has been reduced to farce by the candidates fighting the elections, the petition said.        
	The rights group claimed it had examined the papers filed by candidates of six major parties in the Assembly polls.        
	Of 388 affidavits submitted along with the papers, as many as 369 were incomplete and did not provide the required information, it said.        
	There were about 1,451 non-disclosures in the 369 affidavits, which meant there were about four non-disclosures per affidavit, it said.

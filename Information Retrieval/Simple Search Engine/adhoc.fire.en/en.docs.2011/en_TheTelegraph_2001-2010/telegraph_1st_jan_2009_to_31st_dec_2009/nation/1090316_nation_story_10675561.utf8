The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Altar alliance fillip to Maya
                                                                                                               Altar alliance fillip to Maya
          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	March 15: Some parties seem to be boosting their poll fortunes with alliances made in heaven.        
	Ranjana Bajpai hurriedly quit the Samajwadi Party, where she was national president of the womens wing, to join the BSP yesterday. Her son is apparently set to marry the daughter of a BSP leader.        
	Some may have been puzzled yesterday when Ranjana chose to thank only BSP general secretary S.C. Mishra for bringing her into the party. The regular thing at these events is to thank the party state president  now Swami Prasad Maurya  who was present at the news conference.        
	To those inclined to spy a deep political reason behind everything, Ranjanas gesture was one Brahmins salute to the new Brahmin mascot of a traditionally Dalit party.        
	Others, though, had a knowing look. According to them, Mishra is the would-be father-in-law of Ranjanas son Harsh Vardhan.        
	Still, the Brahmin theory has a point. The alliance, political or matrimonial, of the prominent Mishra and Bajpai families will send a strong message to the states 15 per cent Brahmin voters.        
	Her family legacy is one other reason why Ranjana is a prize catch for Mayavati. Ranjanas mother-in-law Rajendra Kumari Bajpai was a senior Congress leader, Union minister and a close associate of Indira Gandhi.        
	Ranjana and her estranged husband Ashok were with the Congress and then with the Samajwadis. Son Harsh, 27, had joined the BSP two years ago after being denied an Assembly ticket by the Congress.        
	The BSP fielded him from Allahabad North but he lost by a narrow margin and now heads its Allahabad city unit. Ashok will be the BSP candidate from Allahabad for the Lok Sabha polls.        
	Ranjana is one of a dozen-odd Samajwadi leaders who have joined Mayavatis party this year. The BSP has quickly appointed her co-ordinator for the Sitapur, Mohanlalganj, Mishrikh, Dharaura, Kheri and Hardoi seats. She will also look after Allahabad.

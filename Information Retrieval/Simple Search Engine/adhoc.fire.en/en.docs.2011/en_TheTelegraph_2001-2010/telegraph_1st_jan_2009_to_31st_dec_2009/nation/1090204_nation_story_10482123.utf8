  - BJP shortlists 15 apolitical candidates         SANJAY K. JHA                            Kumble, Tipnis                                
	New Delhi, Feb. 3: The BJP is working on a plan to field a new breed of candidates that will help it water down its image as an orthodox Hindutva outfit.        
	It has set its sights on moderate intellectuals, high-profile bureaucrats, retired service chiefs, sports personalities and young icons.        
	The partys Prime Minister candidate L.K. Advani has been arguing with the RSS that he be given a free hand in candidate selection to implement this agenda.        
	Advani and his aides have convinced the RSS that the BJP draws sustenance from the urban middle class and it must dig deeper into this constituency by co-opting prominent personalities.        
	Sources said the BJP would field at least 15 apolitical personalities across the country. The names under consideration are former air force chief A.Y. Tipnis, journalist Chandan Mitra, cricketer Anil Kumble and retired bureaucrats Vijay Kapoor and Hardeep Puri.        
	Kapoor was chief secretary in the Jammu and Kashmir government and Delhis Lt Governor. Puri was a secretary in the foreign ministry.        
	While Tipnis is willing to contest from Maharashtra, Mitras name has been listed against the New Delhi seat.        
	The BJP had wanted Arun Jaitley to contest New Delhi to signal a shift from the Vijay Kumar Malhotra phase, but he was apparently unable to make up his mind. Jaitleys name does not figure in the list submitted to the central election committee by the Delhi unit.        
	A party leader said Advani felt Mitra would be a good replacement as he represents the same class  English-speaking, forward-looking intellectual who can identify with the young, emerging India.        
	Mitra, who takes care to distance himself from the BJP by saying he had made the Rajya Sabha through a presidential nomination, has been appearing on TV shows as an advocate of the party over the past few years.        
	Kumble, who has just quit international cricket, is willing to join the fray as a BJP candidate. But Karnataka chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa is apparently not interested in sparing the Bangalore seat for a non-political new entrant. So, Kumble will be fielded from some other constituency in or outside Karnataka.        
	The names of some interesting candidates the party is considering are being kept secret. The BJP feels it can push up its tally by at least 12 seats with the help of popular faces and also refurbish its image.        
	Advani has been extensively talking about issues of public concern instead of his pet Hindutva project. In this context, he has met representatives of farmers and corporate houses as well as town planners and drinking water experts.                    
	A surprise addition to his website is a picture of Madhya Pradesh chief minister S.S. Chauhan working in the fields. BJP circles are curious how Chauhan could have replaced Narendra Modi on the portal.

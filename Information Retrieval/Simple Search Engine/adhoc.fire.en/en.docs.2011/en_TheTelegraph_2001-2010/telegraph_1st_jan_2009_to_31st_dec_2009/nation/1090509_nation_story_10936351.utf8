          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, May 8: The police commissionerate will soon take up blood grouping in schools, project tie-ups for organ donations and adoption of villages.        
	These were few of the decisions taken at the executive committee meeting of the Indian Red Crosss regional branch opened at the police commissionerate.         
	The branch started in October last year and since then we have organised several blood donation camps and provided compensation to many needy accident victims, said police commissioner Bijay Sharma.        
	The police have been planning a tie-up with Drusti Daan for eye donations. We are trying to figure out how procedural delays in suicides and accidents can be shortened, making it convenient for eye donations, he said.        
	More than 20 persons have agreed to pledge their bodies for medical studies. We will be tying up with more interested individuals for the cause, Tapasi Praharaj, an executive committee member said.        
	Two ambulances have been proposed to be purchased to meet the medical needs of residents. The commissionerate has also planned to adopt a village to carry on several developmental activities.

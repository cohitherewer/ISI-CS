  - Chinas J amp;K discrimination irks India         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Oct. 1: India has protested against Chinas move of issuing visas on a separate piece of paper to Indian passport holders from Jammu and Kashmir.        
	The standard practice is to stamp the visa on the passport. New Delhi views Beijings latest move, which came to light a few weeks ago, as an attempt to question Jammu and Kashmirs status as an integral part of India.        
	It is our considered view and position that there should be no discrimination against visa applicants of Indian nationality on grounds of domicile or ethnicity. We have conveyed our well-justified concern to the Chinese government, foreign ministry spokesman Vishnu Prakash said.        
	For several years, the Chinese embassy has been issuing such stapled visas  visas on separate pieces of paper stapled to the passport  to residents of Arunachal Pradesh, which Beijing claims as its territory. India had objected to this but Beijing has continued with the practice.        
	This is the first time that stapled visas have been issued to Jammu and Kashmir residents. The foreign ministry believes China is toeing the line of Pakistan, its all-weather ally, on Kashmir.        
	The visas are valid, the Chinese embassy spokeswoman said. However, the home ministry has asked immigration authorities to prevent any Kashmir resident from travelling to China if his passport has not been stamped by Chinese authorities.        
	Immigration officials at several Indian airports had already refused to acknowledge the stapled visas issued to Kashmir residents. They continued to reject the visas even after the would-be travellers returned with letters from the Chinese embassy that certified the visas as genuine.        
	The travellers then approached the foreign ministry, which has taken the matter up with the Chinese embassy.        
	The controversy comes amid reported border incursions by China and at a time New Delhi has said it will not encourage permits for semi-skilled workers, which will affect Chinese and Bangladeshis looking to work in India.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today conveyed to Premier Wen Jiabao his greetings to the government and people of China on the republics 60th anniversary. The message said: This is an important milestone in the life of China and an occasion for celebrations of your great nations many achievements. As a friendly neighbour and a developing nation, we in India share your sense of happiness on this important occasion.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong plays hardball with NCP for seats
                                                                                                               Cong plays hardball with NCP for seats
          SANJAY K. JHA                            Sonia and Pawar                                 
	New Delhi, Sept. 12: Senior Congress leaders are convinced the tie-up with the Nationalist Congress Party in Maharashtra can survive only if the ally makes substantial compromises on seat shares in the upcoming state polls and on portfolios later.        
	The Congress is waiting for a positive signal from the NCP before beginning formal negotiations even though filing of nominations starts barely five days from now.        
	Sonia Gandhi and her political secretary Ahmed Patel discussed the problems with Maharashtra leaders Vilasrao Deshmukh, Sushil Kumar Shinde and Mukul Wasnik this morning.        
	Sources said the meeting agreed that the NCP could be taken on board only if it showed a sense of accommodation. The Maharashtra leaders are said to have conveyed to Sonia that the Congress was much better prepared than the NCP to fight the Assembly elections alone.        
	Congress leaders say they cannot show much flexibility on seat shares because of commitments made to 11 Independents, who have been associated with the party for the past five years, and 10 Shiv Sena legislators who crossed over recently.        
	The NCP contested 121 seats in the previous state polls; the Congress is willing to offer it 109 this time if Sharad Pawar is prepared to make adjustments so the Congress can accommodate this group of 21. This will require the NCP to forgo 12 seats and exchange a few.        
	The message the Congress has received so far is that the NCP will not go below 119. This is unacceptable to the Congress and could cause the alliance to collapse.        
	Another major hurdle is portfolio distribution in the next state government. The Congress wants the NCP to accept the UPAs national formula, where ministries are allocated on the basis of party strength in the House.        
	The Congress and the NCP now hold an equal number of ministries in Maharashtra. The Congress expects the NCPs numbers to go down this time. Therefore, it believes, the NCP cannot lay claim to all the ministries it now has.        
	The Congress feels the NCP mishandled important departments like home, finance and power in the current state government. Although all three cannot be exchanged, the Congress is determined to take the home ministry this time.        
	The issue has become no less important than that of seat shares. The NCP argues that a portfolio distribution would be premature now, and that accusing an ally of mismanaging ministries casts a shadow on the whole government.        
	But the Congress remembers the hard post-poll bargain the NCP drove last time and therefore, wants a prior commitment.        
	Congress leaders have adopted a rigid stance mainly because of two reasons. One, if Pawar decides to walk out of the alliance, it will make his position untenable at the Centre; and two, the NCP will be the worse loser if it goes to the polls alone. Congress leaders are hopeful that the ally will relent and accept the conditions.

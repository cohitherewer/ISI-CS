The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Dragged to safety from flooded town

	Kurnool, Oct. 3: Teacher Savitri Reddy, 27, was wading back home after Gandhi Jayanti celebrations at her school when police stopped her yesterday morning.        
	She was rudely told she must leave her home and stay in one of the 43 relief camps set up outside Kurnool town.        
	I just picked up my children and climbed into the lorry sent by them (the district administration), Savitri said today.        
	She and her children are among the one lakh people  25 per cent of Kurnool towns population  who have been evacuated, some of them forcibly. They have been put up at 43 camps scattered outside the town for over 24 hours now, but food, water or medicine is yet to reach them. Savitri said she had food at home.        
	Its a moot point if she would have been better off home, though, since the floodwaters kept rising, and the administration later turned off the drinking water supply across the town after floodwaters entered the filters.        
	Power supply has been stopped and the sewerage is choked. Some of the older buildings are threatened with collapse. We have advised all town residents to stay away from their homes for another day because many might collapse after 24 hours of flooding, a district official said.        
	Its because of all these reasons, officials say, that everyone living in the towns low-lying areas  such as the Kurnool Municipal Housing Colony where Savirti lives  was evacuated.        
	Without that quick decision on Friday, after heavy rain on Thursday, the death toll in the states worst-hit town may have climbed above the current figure of 15 (the state-wide count is 45). However, the administration left hundreds of villages and smaller towns in Kurnool district to the mercy of the surging waters from the rivers Krishna, Tungbhadra, Handri and Neva.        
	The authorities even released floodwaters from a reservoir into the river Handri, causing flash floods in Nandyal town, 90km south of Kurnool, that left 30,000 homeless.        
	The administration has had to act with virtually no prior experience, since the region is known for droughts and not floods. We had only heard of floods; this is the first time we have seen one, said Govindappa, 60, a villager who lives 40km from Kurnool, with only a little exaggeration.        
	From the windows of a relief helicopter, Kurnool town looked like a sheet of water this morning. Some homeless people had climbed atop the historical burz (granite watch tower) near the old bus stand to save themselves. Country boats and navy boats hastened around rescuing people from rooftops, helped by young neighbourhood volunteers.        
	Nearly 4.5 lakh people have been evacuated in the Kurnool, Mahboobnagar, Krishna and Guntur districts and taken to relief camps, chief minister K. Rosaiah said in the afternoon. He added that some 4,000 were still marooned.        
	The rain has eased and the water level is dropping in most rivers, but officials are still worried.         
	The inflow into the Srisailam reservoir on the Krishna, 120km from Kurnool town, has reached an all-time high  22 lakh cusecs.

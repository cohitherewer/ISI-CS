  - Ministries working on plan to offer politicians toehold in schemes         CITHARA PAUL                          A child being given medicine under the National Rural Health Mission in Assam                                        
	New Delhi, Aug. 17: Popular isnt enough, it has to be political, too.        
	Thats what the rural development and minority affairs ministries believe  at least when it comes to government schemes.        
	The ministries, handling schemes that are credited with playing a role in bringing the Congress back to power, are working on a mechanism to make MPs and MLAs an integral part of all major welfare schemes the two departments launch.        
	It would make the system more efficient, sources in the two ministries said.        
	As part of this politicisation process, these ministries are planning to convene all-party meetings to devise a comprehensive strategy that will ensure a greater role for political representatives.        
	For the rural development ministry, the politicisation process will start with the rural employment guarantee scheme (NREGS), the flagship programme of the Congress-led UPA government.        
	So far, elected representatives had no role in overseeing implementation of schemes like the NREGS and had always complained that they were merely onlookers.        
	We have decided to convene an all-party meeting to discuss the issue as all political parties feel that their local representatives should have a more important say in what is happening in their constituencies, said junior minister Sisir Adhikary from Bengal.        
	If an MP or an MLA monitors a scheme, the system will become more efficient, the Trinamul Congress leader added. Moreover, an MP or an MLA has the right to know whether a government project is being implemented in the right way. It is their duty to see to it that government money does not go waste.        
	The rural development ministry has already sent directives to states asking them to ensure that local MPs and MLAs are included in district-level vigilance and monitoring committees.        
	A crucial role has been assigned to members of Parliament, elected representatives of the state legislatures and panchayati raj institutions by including them in the vigilance and monitoring committees, the directive says. It also says these committees should meet every three months.        
	The minority affairs ministry, too, has issued similar directives regarding the multi-sectoral development programme. So far, 90 districts have been selected for this scheme, which aims to improve the socio-economic parameters in districts where minorities account for more than 25 per cent of the population.        
	The ministry had called a meeting to discuss the scheme and had invited 100 MPs from the 90 districts. It is another matter that only 35 MPs attended the meet.        
	Politicians just want to take credit for everything. Once they realise that schemes like the rural employment guarantee programme and minority scholarship schemes are a hit with the people, everyone wants a share of the pie though not many are seriously interested, said an official with the minority affairs ministry. We only hope that these politicians will not create hurdles by trying to politicise them.

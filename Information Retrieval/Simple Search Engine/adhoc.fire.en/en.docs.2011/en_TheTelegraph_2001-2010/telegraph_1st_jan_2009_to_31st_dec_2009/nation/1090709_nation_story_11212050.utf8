	Patna, July 8 (PTI): Two contractors, who travelled to Bhagalpur, 250km from Patna, are suspected to have been kidnapped, police said today.        
	Arvind Chaudhary, a resident of Saidpur under Khagaul police station area of Patna, and his partner, Yogendra Yadav, of Bihia village in Bhojpur district, were allegedly abducted by five men who visited their hotel room last evening. Danapur deputy superintendent of police Anand Kumar today confirmed the news.        
	Chaudhary and Yadav, engaged in the business of constructing and maintaining mobilephone towers, had travelled to the eastern Bihar town by car with Chaudharys driver, Ashok Kumar.        
	Hotel personnel said that five men visited them while another Bhagalpur acquaintance, Amit, was present in the room.         
	The eight then left the hotel taking Chaudharys car and driver but Amit was forced to get down near Tilka Manjhi Chowk.         
	The car then reportedly sped away with the two contractors and the driver.         
	Amit then called up Chaudharys family who registered an FIR with Khagaul police station. Amit has confirmed that he did not recognise the five men who came to the hotel room.

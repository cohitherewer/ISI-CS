The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Centre not heeding demand: Nitish
                                                                                                               Centre not heeding demand: Nitish
                            
	Supaul, June 12 (PTI): Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar today said that the Centre was not heeding the state governments demand for a Rs 14,800 crore R amp;R package for the Kosi area, ravaged by the deluge in 2008.        
	We carried out the best possible relief work in the Kosi belt with what little resources we had...         
	We submitted a package of Rs 14,800 crore a few months ago for rehabilitation and reconstruction of the Kosi ravaged area, however, received little response from the Centre. Instead they (Centre) asked us (government) to refund the Rs 1,000 crore given for relief operation, Nitish said while addressing a public meeting here during his vikas yatra.        
	I wrote to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for early approval of the package, but the matter cannot move ahead with the help of assurances, he lamented.         
	He assured that his government would carry out the rehabilitation and reconstruction from its limited resources if financial assistance from the Centre was not available soon enough.        
	Nitish, who inaugurated and laid the foundation stone for 201 schemes worth Rs 452 crore in the district, thanked the people for supporting his party and ensuring the victory of Vishwamohan Kumar with a huge margin in the area.        
	Vishwamohan Kumar and other MPs, he said, would raise the demand for rehabilitation package for Kosi victims and also press for coal linkages for 14 thermal power projects that has been languishing, despite receiving a clearance from the State Investment Promotion Board (SIPB).        
	The chief minister called upon the people to maintain harmony and brotherhood, which would help the state move on the fast-track of development and prosperity.        
	Nitish also announced the start of a polytechnic at Supaul that would cater to the needs of students, who are otherwise forced to migrate to other parts of the country in search of job-oriented courses.

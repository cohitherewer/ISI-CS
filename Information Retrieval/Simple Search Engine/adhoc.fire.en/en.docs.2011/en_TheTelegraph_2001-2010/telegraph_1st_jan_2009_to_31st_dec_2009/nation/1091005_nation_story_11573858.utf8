The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cross-border strike alert
                                                                                                               Cross-border strike alert
          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, Oct. 4: About 35 hardcore Maoists from Jharkhand had reportedly sneaked into Chhattisgarh to carry out major operations.        
	The intrusion apparently took place about a week ago. But intelligence officials were busy developing inputs and, finally, confirmed heavy infiltration of Maoists from Jharkhand today.        
	The police now have solid evidence and information that heavily armed Maoists from Jharkhand have entered Sarguja region of Chhattisgarh, inspector-general of police (Sarguja range) R.C. Patel said.         
	The number of Maoists could be more than three dozens, Patel added.         
	Based on the information and inputs, security personnel had been pushed into the forest pockets that straddle between Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, he said.         
	Sources said that about three companies (300 jawans) of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) and five companies (500 jawans) of the Chhattisgarh Armed Force (CAF) are engaged in search operations in the forests.        
	The security personnel are combing the entire area and had struck at a few places where the Maoists would have made camps. But as of now, the security personnel had not received breakthrough to trace the rebels, Patel said.        
	Moreover, the intelligence officials have also failed to develop the information about the motive of Jharkhand Maoists for entering into Chhattisgarh region. The move (intrusion) can be aimed to carry out a major operation in the region, said a police officer.

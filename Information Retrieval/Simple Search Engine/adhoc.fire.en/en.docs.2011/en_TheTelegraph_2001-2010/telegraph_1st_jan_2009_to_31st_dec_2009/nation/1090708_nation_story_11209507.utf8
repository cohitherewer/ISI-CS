          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Mamata: State obsession?                                  
	New Delhi, July 7: The BJP today assailed railway minister Mamata Banerjee for her alleged obsession with Bengal, gifting the indignant Trinamul Congress leader an opportunity to reaffirm loyalty to her home state.        
	In the Lok Sabha, BJP leader Ananth Kumar suggested that Mamata was trying to turn the Indian Railways into an East India Company. He insisted that she had given a raw deal to the rest of the country and said: Sab kuchh Bengal/baki sab kangal (everything for Bengal and the rest is made bankrupt). The BJP leader infuriated Mamata, whose partys electoral fortunes turned the corner after she walked out of the NDA, by linking her budget to her political ambition of becoming the chief minister of Bengal.         
	Kumar said the budget was like the election manifesto for Bengal and referred to a proposal to upgrade 309 railway stations, of which 137 were in her state.        
	Mamata angrily confronted the BJP leader, asking him: What is your problem with Bengal? Dont insult my state. I will do whatever I have to for Bengal.        
	Lalu Prasad added fuel to the fire by arguing that model stations were a concept and not to be implemented at all. This triggered a bigger squabble, prompting L.K. Advani to step in to ask if the government was announcing projects just like that.         
	Lalu Prasad again showed his displeasure at the promise to bring the white paper on his performance by challenging the government to prove any wrongdoing by him. His outburst prompted Mamata to make a pacifying intervention. The minister tried to clarify that she respected her predecessor and the white paper was not aimed at targeting him.        
	Although Lalu Prasad said he did not suspect her intention, he dared the government to institute a parliamentary committee to probe his performance. He asked the government not to be swayed by the BJPs rhetoric.        
	In the Rajya Sabha, Arun Jaitley said the Indian Railways had been reduced to a tool for politicking. He said the previous minister credited himself with the turnaround entitling him to lecture at Harvard University and the new minister turned the management principles upside down, getting qualified to author a book called what they dont teach you at the Harvard Management School.        
	Jaitley flayed Mamata for drifting to non-core areas like promising to build malls and restaurants, nursing colleges, stadiums, printing presses, power plants and laying down optic fibre.        
	Both Kumar and Jaitley asked Mamata to table the white paper on railways in Parliament to expose Lalu Prasads jugglery.

	Bhubaneswar, March 4: Collectors of Naxalite-hit districts such as Kandhamal today sought special security before Lok Sabha and Assembly elections, slated to be held in the second and third week of April.         
	The demand was made by the collectors at a conference, convened by the Orissa chief electoral officer to review the poll preparation.         
	Chief electoral officer Alaka Panda said the poll problems in violence-prone districts were discussed at the meeting and concerned collectors were instructed to submit their requirements in writing.         
	Panda also discussed the law and order arrangements in yesterday with the concerned officials.         
	Today, preparations in 20 districts under the central and southern revenue divisions were reviewed. Collectors and sub-collectors will act as the returning officer for Lok Sabha and Assembly polls. Panda advised the collectors to keep a close watch on the campaigning and election expenditures of political parties and instructed officials to enforce the model code of conduct strictly.         
	The Opposition political parties, even the ruling BJP, earlier had hinted at large-scale misuse of official funds by the BJD in the civic elections in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack. The party was also accused of tampering with the electronic voting machines.         
	The officer directed the officials to check such malpractices and made video recordings of meetings and events mandatory. Instructions were issued to take strict action against mischief-mongers.

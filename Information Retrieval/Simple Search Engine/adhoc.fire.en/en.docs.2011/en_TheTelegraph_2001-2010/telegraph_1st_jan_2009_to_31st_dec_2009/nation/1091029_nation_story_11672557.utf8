The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PM reaches out to Pakistan
                                                                                                               PM reaches out to Pakistan
  - Assurance of resuming dialogue if sincere steps are taken        MUZAFFAR RAINA                          Singh, Sonia Gandhi and Mamata Banerjee at the inauguration of the train service in Anantnag on Wednesday. (PTI)                                        
	Wanpoh (Anantnag), Oct. 28: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today again reached out to Pakistan by promising a friendly response if it showed sincerity in dismantling terror infrastructure on its soil.        
	Singh iterated New Delhis commitment to resume the stalled dialogue process with all sections of society  a clear reference to the separatists  but underlined that any progress on the external front, through talks with Pakistan, could only move forward if it shows sincerity and good faith in dealing with terrorism.        
	I appeal to the people and the government of Pakistan to take forward the hand of friendship that we have extended, Singh told a 10,000-strong gathering in Wanpoh, a town in Anantnag district. We will not be found wanting in responding in a friendly way.        
	He was inaugurating the 18km Anantnag-Qazigund stretch of a railway line, which once completed, will connect Kashmir with the rest of the country.        
	The peace overture was interspersed with tough language. Singh pledged to press the government of Pakistan to curb the activities of those elements that are engaging in terrorism in India.        
	If they are non-state actors, it is solemn duty of government of Pakistan to bring them to book, to destroy their camps and eliminate their infrastructure. The perpetrators of the acts of terror must pay the heaviest penalty for their barbaric crimes against humanity, he said.        
	Singh reminded Pakistan about how eventually they (militants) turn against you and bring only death and destruction.         
	The Prime Ministers message had an eerie resonance across the border. At least 91 people were killed and 200 wounded when a car bomb tore through a busy market in the northwestern Pakistan town of Peshawar, the attack, suspected to be the work of pro-Taliban groups, coinciding with the visit of US secretary of state Hillary Clinton.         
	Since July, the Indian Prime Minister has been repeatedly reaching out to Pakistan to thaw the chill that set in post 26/11.         
	In a joint statement issued after his meeting with his Pakistan counterpart Yousuf Raza Gilani at Sharm-el-Sheikh (Egypt) in July, he agreed to resume the composite dialogue with Pakistan without bracketing it with terrorism, earning domestic rebuke for selling out Indias interests.         
	Again in September, after the G20 summit in Pittsburg, US, Singh said India was ready to normalise relations with its neighbour provided it gave up its old attitude regarding the use of terror as an instrument of state policy.         
	Foreign minister S.M. Krishna has made it clear that composite dialogue cant be resumed unless Delhi saw tangible results on cross-border terrorism based on dossiers provided by India.         
	So far, Pakistan has not acted against Hafiz Saeed, the Lashkar-e-Toiba chief who is among Indias most wanted.        
	We are ready to discuss these and other issues with the government of Pakistan, Singh said.        
	On the internal dimension, Singh sounded more positive. I wish to say again that we are willing to talk to anyone who has any meaningful idea for promoting peace and development in Kashmir. We want to carry all sections of people with us in resolving the political and economic problems of Jammu and Kashmir, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | SC clears quota   air on migrants
                                                                                                               SC clears quota   air on migrants
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Aug. 12: The Supreme Court has held that SC/ST migrants are entitled to reservation in their state of origin and in the central quota, but not in states to which they migrate.        
	The apex court set aside a Delhi High Court ruling which held that such benefits could be given to a group of migrants in the recruitment of teachers by the Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board.         
	The board had rejected their claims on the ground that the candidates involved and/or their parents were migrants to Delhi who also enjoyed ST status in their native places.         
	The Supreme Court took a different view and said ST/SC status in one state would not automatically entitle the beneficiaries to such facilities in other states.        
	Our constitutional scheme seeks to identify social and economic backwardness of people having regard to the state or Union territory as a unit, the apex court said in a ruling last week.         
	It held that persons belonging to a caste or tribe may suffer disadvantages in one state, but may not face the same problems in another.

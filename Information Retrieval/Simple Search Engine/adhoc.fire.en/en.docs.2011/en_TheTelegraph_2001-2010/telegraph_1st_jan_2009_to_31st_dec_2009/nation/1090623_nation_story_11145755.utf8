The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bengal misses coastal boat
                                                                                                               Bengal misses coastal boat
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                               
	New Delhi, June 22: Bengal has failed to secure a single special patrol boat ordered after the Mumbai attack because of lack of infrastructure, with central officials saying the state was lax about coastal security just as it was on Maoists in Lalgarh.        
	The issue of Bengals laxity has come up at several meetings. There is no initiative or interest from the state government for progress on coastal security, said a senior home ministry official.        
	Ironically, the 13 interceptor boats that eight other states, including Bengals neighbour Orissa, and two Union territories have got as part of a Rs 320-crore coastal security plan are manufactured at Calcuttas Garden Reach Shipbuilders amp; Engineers Ltd, besides Goa Shipyard.        
	Bengal will also get the boats but it has to show work on the ground, the home ministry official said.        
	Ministry sources said Bengal had failed to set up a single coastal police station under the coastal security plan despite getting its share of funds from the Centre.        
	Since no coastal infrastructure has been developed, there is no space to anchor or maintain the special boats in the state, the sources said.        
	The technology for the boats was obtained from Greece after the Mumbai attack last November. Two such boats were imported and given to the PSUs, who were told to build replicas on a tight deadline.        
	The boats, being manufactured in 12-tonne and five-tonne variants, can carry up to 10 people and cruise at speeds up to 140 nautical miles per hour. They would give the customs and the coastguard an edge in patrolling the Bay of Bengal as well as the riverine border with Bangladesh.         
	The ministry sources said the bigger boat costs around Rs 2.25 crore and the smaller one Rs 1.05 crore. They are equipped with GPS, radar, searchlights and binoculars.         
	The companies have been told to deliver 24 boats by October this year and 60 boats over the next few months. Of the 194 ordered, 110 will be 12-tonne boats, the rest five-tonne ones.         
	Union home minister P. Chidambaram told the chiefs of the two PSUs last week there should be no delays in deliveries while emphasising the need for training for the upkeep of the boats.         
	He asked the officials to dispatch the six that are ready immediately.         
	Gujarat, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Orissa, Goa, Lakshadweep and Puducherry have got the boats other than Maharashtra and Orissa. Daman and Diu will get them soon.

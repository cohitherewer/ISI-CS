The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tents for Bihars babus
                                                                                                               Tents for Bihars babus
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Oct. 15: Chief minister Nitish Kumar would like to see beaurocrats leave their plush bungalows and offices behind and live with villagers in the states hinterland.        
	Nitishji instructed district magistrates to live with the villagers and solve their problems, said chief secretary Anup Mukherjee while talking to reporters today after the chief ministers meeting with district magistrates and IAS officers.         
	Nitish reportedly asked Mukherjee to address the conference to drive home the point that he wants his bureaucrats to be more serious in implementing policies. Land disputes are the root cause of tension in the states hinterland. DMs have been directed to stay at the dispute site, listen to the parties and then solve the problem.        
	Sixteen farmers of Khagaria were killed in a clash that began as a land dispute between Musahars, a Scheduled Caste, and Kurmis-Koiries over 150 acres of sandy land.         
	The deaths, first-of-its-kind in over a decade, apparently shook Nitish in the run-up to the 2010 Assembly polls.         
	Asked if the soft babus would actually survive in tents, a senior bureaucrat said: It is an order and will be followed. Nitish Kumar stayed in villages during his vikas yatra prior to the Lok Sabha polls in April and May, the official argued.         
	Nitish also wants district magistrates to ensure that widows, handicapped and senior citizens entitled to pension get their due on time. That can happen when the officials meet the people, Mukherjee said.         
	State director-general of police Girish Shankar who was also a part of the meeting, said that he had directed the superintendents of police to organise camps in rural areas.         
	Naxalites are a concern and so is railway property safety. Due to personnel scarcity we are usually not in a position to deploy jawans on all railway stations, he admitted and added: Police-people ratio is low in the state. He, however, said that the police are stepping up efforts to counter the rebel menace.

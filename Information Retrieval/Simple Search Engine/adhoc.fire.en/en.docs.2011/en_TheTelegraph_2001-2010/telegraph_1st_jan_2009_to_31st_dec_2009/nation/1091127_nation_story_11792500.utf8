                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Maoists to Mamata: Dont lie 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Calcutta, Nov. 26: The CPI (Maoist) has warned Mamata Banerjee not to lie about the outfit or malign it at rallies, else there would be trouble for the Trinamul Congress in Nandigram.        
	A statement purportedly by Selim, head of the Maoists Nandigram zonal committee, said: You (Mamata) had said at a rally at Sonachura recently that it was the CPM who brought us to Nandigram in 2007 and provided us with safe passage to flee. You know it was a lie.        
	Selim invited the railway minister to an open debate at Sonachura. If you believe what you said in your speech was a fact, please come to Sonachura and we will prove who is right, you or us.        
	The statement also criticised Mamatas proposal for engaging the army in Lalgarh.        
	It said: We appointed Narayan to lead the Nandigram movement against CPM cadres. Trinamul MP Subhendu Adhikary knows how many times Narayan visited Nandigram and how he worked among the people of the area.        
	You had delivered a speech from a place in Sonachura after the death of Nishikanta Mandal, the local (Trinamul) gram panchayat pradhan. It was the same place where Adhikary had shared a stage with Narayan and our state committee member Sukumar to address the people of Nandigram.        
	The Maoist leader explained why Mandal was killed by his men: After Trinamul achieved political success in Nandigram, it wanted to drive us out of the area. Mandal was planning to hand over Narayan to police. He had to pay for his betrayal. We are still active in Nandigram and we will be there in future.        
	Purulia murder        
	Suspected Maoists today shot dead a teacher of a high school in Purulia and injured the school clerk, both allegedly CPM loyalists.        
	Police said a gang of three fired at Subimal Mali, 45, a teacher at Ranga High School at Barlanga in Arsha near the Ayodhya hills, about 310km from Calcutta. Mali was riding pillion on the motorbike of clerk Ramchandra Laya, 38, on their way back from a bank at Sirkabad, 5km away.        
	Mali died on the spot and Laya has been admitted to hospital with bullet injuries in his stomach.        
	Mohammed Ibrahim, member of the CPMs Purulia district secretariat, said Mali was a CPM supporter and Laya the secretary of the partys Ayodhya hills unit.        
	A police officer said the killers appeared to be Maoists but further probe is needed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Anti-Nitish whiff in budget
                                                                                                               Anti-Nitish whiff in budget
          NALIN VERMA                              Popularity fight: Pranab Mukherjee, Nitish Kumar				                                 
	Patna, July 7: Budget-2009 presented by Pranab Mukherjee and the outbursts over it by Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar are being interpreted as a change in Congresss strategy in the state.        
	After disassociating itself with Lalu Prasad during the past Lok Sabha polls, Congress had adopted a softer stand towards Nitish. Many of its leaders such as Rahul Gandhi had even appreciated Nitishs image of a performing minister.        
	A section of senior Congress leaders were perhaps hoping that the JD(U) leader, often distancing himself from his BJP ally on certain ideological issues, would eventually gravitate towards the Congress, replacing Lalu Prasad as its ally at the Centre.        
	However, despite Nitishs seemingly friendly terms with the Congress, he has stuck to his relationship with the BJP. Now, Congress appears to have decided to operate in the anti-Nitish and the anti-Lalu space in Bihar.         
	Congress strategists feel that the Bihar chief minister by raising the issue of a special status and package for Bihar has been shrewdly building upon his image while pillorying the Congress for neglecting the state.         
	The chief minister is blacking out what the Manmohan Singh government did for the state. Bihars people should not forget that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi visited Bihar at the time of Kosi floods and sanctioned Rs 1,010 crore for the state. There is nothing wrong with the finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee, providing relief to Aila victims in Bengal, said the BPCC chief, Anil Sharma.         
	Sharma pointed out that the chief minister pocketed credit for centrally-sponsored aam admi schemes such as NREGS, Indira Awas Yojna and grants given to the state for construction of highways in the last Lok Sabha polls.         
	This is not an anti-people budget as Nitish Kumar is trying to portray to discredit the Congress and raise his rating in the state. It is a national budget ensuring betterment of life for all aam admis. There are provisions for farmers and poor of the entire country. The Congress has no business to do with Nitish Kumar and are set to go alone in the Assembly elections due next year, he said.         
	However, Pranab Mukherjees failure to make even a reference to Bihar while announcing handloom clusters for Bengal and Tamil Nadu, powerloom clusters for Rajasthan and establishment of new educational campuses in Murshibad (WB) and Mallappuramin (Kerala) has drawn flak from experts.        
	The neglect of a backward state such as Bihar clearly reflects that it does not exist in the cognitive world of the central government. It shows the centres pathological dislike of Bihar, said economist and director of the Asian Development Research Centre (ADRI), Saibal Dasgupta.         
	Even if the Congress decides to operate in the anti-Nitish space, the UPA should not have neglected the state in the Budget-2009, Saibal said, adding: The Congress has lost an opportunity to revive itself here.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Aug. 26: People of seven villages began a relay hunger strike at Kalinga Nagar over the 17-year delay in establishing of a ferro- chrome plant by Misrilal Company.        
	At least 65 acres of fertile agricultural land were acquired from 50 families for the project.        
	Backed by the local sarpanch, the villagers are demanding setting up of the ferro-chrome plant or return of lands acquired from them for the purpose.        
	The villagers have continued with the hunger strike over the past five days in a non-violent manner, Kalinga Nagar police station inspector-in-charge K.C. Mund said today.        
	At least 55 villagers had so far joined the relay hunger strike at Baghabahali, 65km from here, the police said.                     
	The agitating villagers are drawn from Badasudi, Baghabahali, Hanumantapatana, Pankapala, Nimapalli and Ragadi.                          
	According to Pingal sarpanch Bhabani Purty, nearly 67 acres of cultivable agricultural land were acquired from around 50 families for a proposed ferro-chrome plant by Misrilal Company in 1992. The government had also provided the company 655 acres at the Saruabali chromite reserves in Sukinda Valley to meet the raw material requirements.        
	While no plant has come up so far, there has been no let-up in the extraction and sale of chromite ore by the company, said the sarpanch, who is leading the agitation.        
	People of the six villages are also peeved as improvement in healthcare, education, drinking water facilities along with electricity and roads as promised by the company had also not followed during all these years. We had given our lands hoping all-round development of our area. But nothing has happened, said one of the villagers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Didi cloud in overcast sky

          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	Itanagar, Oct. 8: The dark skies that forced Sonia Gandhi and her son to cancel campaign trips to Arunachal Pradesh this week seem to symbolise the uncertainty facing the ruling Congress in the October 13 Assembly polls.        
	Sonia, who was to visit Daporijo in Upper Subansiri and Aalo in West Siang, did not even leave Delhi today. On Tuesday, Rahul had arrived at Lilabari airport in Assam, intending to visit Itanagar 40km away, before poor weather forced him to fly instead to Agartala. In a way that was lucky: he would have been disappointed by the poor turnout at the Indira Gandhi park.        
	The blows come at a time the Congresss prospects of winning absolute majority look bleak amid internal wrangles and the new challenge from the Trinamul Congress. NCP leader Jimmy George claims the days of single-party rule are over in Arunachal which, since gaining statehood two decades ago, has always had a Congress government except for a brief period when Gegong Apang led a BJP ministry.        
	The Congresss problems began after it denied tickets to dissident MLAs. Ten of them, including four former ministers, have joined Trinamul.        
	We will win at least 15 seats, claimed Techi Necha, Trinamul candidate from Itanagar. Necha expects the weather to clear by the time Mamata Banerjee arrives in the last leg of the campaign.        
	The dissidents shouldnt make much difference; we are expecting 38 to 40 seats, a senior Congress leader said. But party workers are less confident, since many senior leaders have been overlooked.        
	For now, the good news for the Congress is that Khandu and two other candidates, Jambey Tashi in Lumla and Tsewang Dhondup in Tawang, have won unopposed.        
	One reason is the paucity of candidates. The Congress is the only party contesting all 60 seats. The BJP, routed in the Lok Sabha polls, is contesting 18, Trinamul 26, NCP 36, Peoples Party of Arunachal 11 and the Janata Dal (United) three. There are just three Independent candidates; most others having joined some party or the other.        
	The Congresss hopes may lie on the 1,559km road, touching 11 districts, that its manifesto promises. Now, travel in Arunachal is punctuated by numerous detours through Assam. Once the state is linked through roads, the cloudy skies will begin to matter less.

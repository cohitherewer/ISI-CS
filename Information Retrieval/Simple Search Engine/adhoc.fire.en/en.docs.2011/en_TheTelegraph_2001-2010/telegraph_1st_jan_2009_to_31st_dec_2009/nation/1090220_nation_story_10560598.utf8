The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Seat scurry in state
                                                                                                               Seat scurry in state
          LALMOHAN PATNAIK                                    
	Cuttack, Feb. 19: With Assembly elections drawing closer, many MLAs and political bigwigs of coastal Orissa are busy scouting for greener pastures, after losing seats due to dissolution of Assembly segments or creation of new constituencies or change in reservation under the delimitation exercise.        
	BJD, Congress and BJP are feeling the heat of delimitation in coastal Orissa as prominent party leaders have lost their constituencies.        
	New constituency maps, drawn to reflect an areas demographic profile, robbed agriculture minister Surendra Nath Nayak of his constituency  Kakatpur  to Scheduled Caste candidates.        
	BJP leader and former revenue minister Manmohan Samal, representing Dhamnagar, also suffered the same fate.         
	Former ministers of school and mass education Bishnu Das and excise department Kalindi Behera are in a quandary, as Jagatsinghpur and Salipur, their respective constituencies, have been de-reserved. Senior Congress leader Ananta Prasad Sethi, who represents Bhandaripokhari constituency is also a victim of the delimitation exercise.         
	For BJD secretary general Damodar Rout, its a tenuous affair as his constituency, Ersama, has been bifurcated into Ersama-Balikuda and Paradip (new constituency). In the process Balikuda, which has Congresss Umesh Swain as its sitting MLA, has been abolished. So is the case with BJDs Cuttack president Dharmananda Behera (Choudwar) and BJD leader Pratap Jena (Kissanagar). Both their constituencies have been abolished. In the process Cuttack Sadar constituency, represented by BJDs Pravat Biswal, has been reorganised and reserved for Scheduled Caste candidates, while a new constituency  Choudwar-Cuttack  has been formed.         
	Congress MLA Chiranjeev Biswal is in a fix as neighbouring Tirtol (represented by him) is now reserved for SC candidates. MLAs from Kendrapada and Govindpur have found that their seats, too, are reserved. Jajpur MLA faces a similar predicament because his seat has been de-reserved. Congresss Nalinikanta Mohanty is also facing difficulty as a new constituency  Mahakalpada  has been carved out of his constituency of Rajnagar.         
	Consequently, neighbouring Pattamundai constituency, represented by BJDs Kishore Tarai, has been abolished and parts of it have been included in Rajnagar.

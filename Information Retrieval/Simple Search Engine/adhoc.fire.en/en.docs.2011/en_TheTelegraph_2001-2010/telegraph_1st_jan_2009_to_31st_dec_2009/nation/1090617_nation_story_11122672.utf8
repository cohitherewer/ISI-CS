The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Million-word march? Nothing but sham
                                                                                                               Million-word march? Nothing but sham
  - Linguists express outrage                              Jai Ho out: Dev Patel and Freida Pinto in Slumdog Millionaire                                  
	Last Wednesday, a Texas-based media consulting firm announced the birth of the millionth English word, which arrived on June 10, 2009, at 10.22am, Stratford-on-Avon time.        
	The lucky lexeme? Web 2.0, which edged out Jai Ho, slumdog, octomom and N00b, a disparaging term for video game newbies.        
	Language experts, asked for comment, found themselves reaching for other words, some of them unprintable.        
	Its bushwa, fraud, hokum, said Geoffrey Nunberg, a linguist at the School of Information at the University of California at Berkeley.        
	Grant Barrett, a lexicographer and co-founder of the online dictionary Wordnik.com, said: Its a sham. Its a hoax. Its fake. Its not real.         
	Indeed, its hard to find scholars who react with anything less than blunt outrage at the headline-garnering Million-Word March, which was begun in 2003 by Paul JJ Payack, the president and chief word analyst of Global Language Monitor.         
	They point to the frequently revised predictions of the fateful words arrival, perhaps to coincide with the publication of his book about the project. They question the validity of the algorithm used to pinpoint when a word crossed the threshold of 25,000 geographically scattered uses  something they say even Google could not come up with.         
	Payack defended himself, conceding that the announcement of the millionth word was just an estimate. But he insisted it was still significant.         
	English has an amazing ability to accept new words, generated from every corner of the world, and thats a fascinating concept that should be acknowledged, he said.        
	True enough, say linguists, who with all the computer firepower they use these days are hardly word mavens trying to keep techie barbarians out of the sacred precincts of Johnson. The question of how to count words  and just why English speakers love to hear about their weird and variegated lexicon  opens up fundamental issues about what English, and a word, is.         
	English is definitely big. The Oxford English Dictionary lists about 600,000 words (mostly from written sources), with more than 1,000 added annually. Merriam-Websters estimates there are about a million words in English, give or take a quarter-million  far more than the 500,000-plus claimed by the runner-up, Mandarin Chinese, and the 100,000-odd words of French.        
	But the idea of an English word is inherently fuzzy. How do you count compound words like hot dog or infinitely expandable ones like great-great-great-great-aunt? What about foreign loan words? Terms for chemical compounds (roughly 84 million) or insect species (roughly one million)? The slang terms that wink in and out of existence without ever making it into print?        
	Our fascination with the vastness of English, Nunberg said, springs from a kind of linguistic imperialism  a feeling that our dictionaries are bigger than their dictionaries. But this doesnt really make us any richer linguistically, he contended. Its not like the French are impoverished because they have fewer fish names, he said.        
	Some linguists argue that our obsession with the odd profusion of English misses what is really distinctive about the language: its grammar.         
	Lots of languages have a mixed-up lexicon, but few have Englishs hybrid structure, said John McWhorter, a linguist at the Manhattan Institute. English grammar has been bastardised by Celtic, then beaten up by Vikings, who made it simpler than it would otherwise be, he said. We are speaking a bastard and beaten tongue with a very unusual grammatical history.        
	But try getting anyone interested in a story about that.                    NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

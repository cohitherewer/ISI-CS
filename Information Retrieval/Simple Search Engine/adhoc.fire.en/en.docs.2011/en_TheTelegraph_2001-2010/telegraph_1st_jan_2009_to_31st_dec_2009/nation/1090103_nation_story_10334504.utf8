          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Jan. 2: Red tape has caused a delay of 12 months (and more) to a plan to restore and reinstate rare archaeological finds  three caskets believed to have belonged to the era of Lord Buddha  at Lalitgiri, some 60km from here.         
	Activists of Buddhayan, a Lalitgiri-based society committed to the preservation of Buddhist heritage in the area, are disappointed over the delay in restoration.        
	Union culture minister Ambika Soni and director-general of Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) Ansu Baisya in September 2008 had assured us that the matter would be communicated very soon, said Pradipta Bhuyan, the president of Buddhayan.         
	To press their demands further, Buddhayan members met B.R. Mani, the joint director of the ASI, to submit a memorandum. He did assure us that he would take up the matter with the cultural department secretary and the ASI director-general soon, said Debendra Kumar Sahu, secretary of the Buddhayan.        
	The caskets were discovered 23 years ago during an excavation by the ASI at Lalitagiri under the Mahanga tehsil in Cuttack and were promptly moved to a vault at ASI circle office in Bhubaneswar.        
	There can be no rationale behind the decision to leave the caskets in a strong room in Bhubaneswar, said Sahu. Heritage enthusiasts have been struggling for the return and display of the caskets in their place with Buddhayan spearheading the movement.

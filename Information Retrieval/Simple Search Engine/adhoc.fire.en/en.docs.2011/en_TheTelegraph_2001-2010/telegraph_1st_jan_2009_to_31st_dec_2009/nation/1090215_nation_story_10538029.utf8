The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rescuers shut out, thieves prowl   Relief team kept at bay as man crawls on road
                                                                                                               Rescuers shut out, thieves prowl     -  Relief team kept at bay as man crawls on road
          PRONAB MONDAL                          VERTICAL CRUSH: An overturned bogie lies underneath another near the accident site in Jajpur. Picture by Amit Datta                                        
	Cause: Relief train from Kharagpur reaches Jajpur at 11pm, Friday, but none of the 30 rescuers and doctors is allowed by police to enter the accident site till Saturday morning              
	Effect I: Jajpur Hospitals four doctors and 30 beds the only relief for 119 accident victims through the night                
	Effect II: The 119 are luckier than Satyanarayan De. He climbs out of coach S-4 and, blood oozing from head and left leg, drags himself along narrow metalled road beside the tracks till he passes out. Wakes up two hours later to find himself lying in the same spot, now bathed in blood, with no rescuers in sight                
	Jajpur (Orissa), Feb. 14: Chaos at the site of yesterdays train tragedy not only delayed rescue and treatment but forced the injured victims into getting their wounds complicated.        
	We received a shock when the local police refused to let us cross their makeshift rope fencing around the accident site, saying they needed written orders, a member of the Kharagpur team said.        
	Yet many outsiders were roaming about freely. By the time they let us in this morning, everything was over.                    
	Vegetable vendor Mintu Sarkar, passenger from Raiganj, too saw the outsiders. They merely added another dimension to the chaos that has robbed Mintu of the Rs 45,000 he had saved over five years for his mothers treatment.        
	The 28-year-old was taking mother Jyotsna, who has renal failure, to Chennais Apollo Hospitals.        
	I was in coach S-2. After it overturned, I somehow got my mother out of the compartment, he said.        
	But when I returned for my bag, I saw some local people running along the tracks. They were entering the coaches and leaving with the luggage. I couldnt find my bag.        
	I went to the police, who showed me a huge pile of luggage. But my bag was not there.        
	By then, Satyanarayan was crawling along the road.        
	There was no one to help me to hospital. Railway staff and a handful of policemen were scampering about aimlessly, the young man said this morning.        
	I crawled 50 metres but the deep gash around my left ankle was giving me hell and I soon fainted.        
	When he regained consciousness, he cried for help.        
	Two men lifted me by my arms and legs and laid me down on the floor of a temple. A man came and wrapped a bandage round my wounds. I havent been given a single dose of medicine though its now 12 hours since the accident, he said.        
	P. Baldev Singh, a police officer who was squatting on the tracks around 6.30am, claimed he knew nothing about the rescue team being turned back.        
	Even if it has happened, theres nothing unusual about it, he shrugged.        
	There was commotion and tension at the time, and that may have led to a communication gap.        
	Such a gap spread confusion over the death toll. The railways East Coast Division had said last night the number was 16, but junior railway minister R. Velu, who visited the site today, said the figure was nine.        
	T. Sarengi, the official in charge of Jajpur Hospital, said the hospital was not equipped to deal with such a disaster. But we informed hospitals in Bhadrak and Cuttack, and their doctors later joined us.        
	The accident victims, however, said the doctors began arriving only early in the morning after they had been through a night of horror. Some 13 patients were shifted to Cuttack today.        
	The rescuers from Kharagpur carried those unattended like Satyanarayan to their train, which left for Bengal around 3pm.

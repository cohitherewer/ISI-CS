                                                                                                               ROMPING ON LEFT RUINS
  - Mamata rsquo;s half-a-dozen in Manmohan rsquo;s team
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       Saugata Roy            Sisir Adhikary            CM Jatua                          
	New Delhi, May 27: Bengal and Kerala have benefited hugely from the rout of the Left in its traditional bastions, both grabbing unprecedented numbers in the Union council of ministers.         
	Bengal gets eight, including two cabinet berths  Pranab Mukherjee (finance) and Mamata Banerjee (railways); Kerala secures six, again with two cabinet positions  A.K. Antony (defence) and Vayalar Ravi (yet unassigned).         
	Kerala has doubled its presence over Manmohan Singhs first government, Bengal has leapt four-fold  it only had Mukherjee and Priya Ranjan Das Munshi in the last cabinet. Most of this is space that the Left  allies of the UPA for the better part of the last term  occupied in the last Lok Sabha, but it never got represented in ministerial terms because the communists chose to stay out of the government.         
	The Trinamul boss, in fact, could have justifiably bargained for more, both in terms of numbers and seniority of ministers  she is the biggest UPA ally with one more MP than the DMK and has enough political experience packed into MPs like Saugata Roy, Sultan Ahmed and Dinesh Trivedi  but her eyes are probably more focused on the Assembly elections of 2011 and she wants her best energies diverted there.                     Sultan Ahmed            Mukul Roy            Dinesh Trivedi    
	Kerala, which even otherwise wields huge influence in Delhis power circles, is savouring its own rare moment of prominence  it has never had it so good.         
	Six ministers means Kerala matches the united might of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Uttarakhand. And they may all have a native son to thank  CPM general secretary Prakash Karat, none else.         
	But Keralas run on Delhi is not solely dependent on the vicissitudes of politics. The overweening sweep Malayalees  often referred to by the unkind as Malloo Mafia  enjoy over non-political instruments of state is remarkable for a state that only counts for roughly 3 per cent of the nations population.         
	Run an eye across the power corridors and you will probably have a sense of just how formidable that teeny strip of land wedged between Tamil Nadu and the Arabian Sea has made itself  Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan, cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrashekhar, national security adviser M.K. Narayanan, secretary to the President of India Christy Fernandes, principal secretary to the Prime Minister T.K.A. Nair, joint secretary in the PMO R. Gopalakrishnan, foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon, commerce secretary G.K. Pillai, agriculture secretary Nanda Kumar, law secretary T.K. Vishwanathan, civil aviation secretary M. Madhavan Nambiar, food processing secretary P.I. Suvadhan, space secretary G. Madhavan Nair, parliamentary affairs secretary P.J. Thomas, overseas Indians affairs secretary Mohan Das, secretary general of the Lok Sabha P.D.T. Achary, National Intelligence Agency boss Radha Vinod Raju. Phew!!         
	But dont tell a Malloo that  hell begin adding to that list sooner than youve finished counting.         
	How about Nirupama Rao, sir? She may become the next foreign secretary and was actually born a Menon, or is it Nair? Anyhow, a true-blue Malloo all the same!

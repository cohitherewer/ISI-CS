	New Delhi, Nov. 27 (PTI): Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar today charged the Centre with ruining the very concept of decentralisation of power, saying the UPA government was bypassing states in the decision-making process.        
	Decentralistion of power as prescribed by Ram Manohar Lohia in his concept of four pillars of democracy should start from the Centre to states, which in turn should reach the districts and village panchayats. However, nowadays the Centre is bypassing states and, without taking them into confidence, is making policies sitting in Delhi, Nitish said, while addressing a conference to mark Lohias birth centenary celebrations here.        
	He added that all states had their own set of problems, but the Centre was enforcing its schemes on states instead of funding schemes made by state governments.                           
	This kind of policy by the Centre is in direct contradiction with Lohias chaukhamba raj concept. This is just lopsided decentralisation of power, he said.        
	The chief minister was speaking on the subject Lohia and Chaukhamba Raj organised by the Institute of Social Sciences.        
	He said that on one hand Centre said that centrally sponsored schemes should come down but at the same time it was increasing them. It makes schemes and turn them into laws, forcing them on states and then take credit for their initiatives, he added.        
	The Centre has brought the Right to Education Act, though in Bihar we have also started similar initiatives to encourage girls to attend schools. It should fund our schemes but it makes us follow its own schemes, Nitish said.        
	Nitish said that Lohia had described villages, districts, states and the Union as the four pillars of democracy, and his government had taken measures to strengthen the panchayati raj system in Bihar. The significance of panchayats had diminished during the British rule and their deterioration continued even after Independence due to increased interference of the state. However, now they have a constitutional status. Soon after coming to power, we took out an ordinance to conduct panchayat elections and apart from women, gave reservation to extremely backward class category in panchayati raj institutions. This step changed the sociological scenario of Bihar completely, he said.        
	Nitish said that women not only became more confident, heading panchayats also increased awareness about health and education among them. While this move strengthened panchayat system in Bihar, it made the Centre emulate our step and the UPA government has also announced 50 per cent reservation for women in panchayats. However, there is a long way to go for us, he added.        
	Nitish further said if panchayats were included in decision making and are properly empowered, then they would not take the wrong path. Nowadays, there is a lot of discussion about tackling Naxalite violence. But in Bihar, we have empowered panchayats by involving them in relief and rehabilitation work during floods and given them several decision making powers, and the result is that there is no report of any violent incident taking place in Bihar, Nitish said, adding that they needed orientation and training.

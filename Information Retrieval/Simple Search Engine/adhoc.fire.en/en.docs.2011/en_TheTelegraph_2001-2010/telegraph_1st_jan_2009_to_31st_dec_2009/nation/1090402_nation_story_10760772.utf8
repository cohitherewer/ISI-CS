The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mumbai trains kill 17 every day
                                                                                                               Mumbai trains kill 17 every day
          RHYS BLAKELY                               
	Mumbai, April 1: Passengers regularly forced to cling limpet-like to the sides of Mumbais rush-hour trains because there is no room inside will tell you that as commutes go, theirs is a killer.         
	And they arent joking: 17 people died every weekday on the citys suburban rail network last year  a record for what may well be the worlds deadliest stretch of track.         
	Details of the death toll confirm the stories told by veteran commuters in the city, a group long inured to the sight of body parts littering the line.         
	The figures, which were obtained for The Times using the Right to Information Act, show that the lions share of fatalities  3,443 out of a total of 4,357 in 2008  were caused by people being mown down by trains while trespassing on the tracks.         
	The next biggest portion of deaths  853, or more than three every working day  were of passengers who fell (or were pushed) from carriages that travel at over 60kmph, have no doors and are often crammed dangerously full. Another 41 people perished after being bludgeoned by trackside poles while hanging out of overcrowded trains.         
	Twenty-one were electrocuted to death by power cables as they sat on the roof  a location often chosen to avoid paying for tickets that cost only a few rupees.         
	The statistics suggest that Mumbais commuters are nothing if not pragmatic. Even after taking into account the frequent timetable disruptions caused by railway deaths, the level of congestion on the citys roads means the trains attractions outweigh the dangers, many say.         
	A 45-minute train journey across town can easily take more than two hours by car, Indranil Mukherjee, a news photographer who relies on the railway as the fastest route to reach breaking stories, said.         
	Yes, you will see the occasional dead body... but a three-month unlimited pass only costs about Rs 1,500.         
	Visitors are advised to treat the city railway with respect. It carries 7 million people a day and is a third more densely packed than Tokyos famously congested equivalent.         
	Officials have coined the term super-dense crushload to describe how 550 commuters are regularly crammed into a carriage built for 200  a situation where up to 16 standing passengers share every square metre of floor space.         
	The government acknowledges that Indias creaking infrastructure needs an urgent overhaul. However, a recent report by law firm Allen amp; Overy estimated that the country faces a $190-billion (Rs 9.69 lakh crore) shortfall in the financing required for the task and in Mumbai train safety appear to be getting worse.         
	Pressure groups are angry that state authorities have backed policies that favour private cars, instead of investing in public transport. The Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment claims that more than a half of Indias cities are fogged by critical levels of pollution and is disapproving of the generous state aid given to Nano manufacturers.         
	In a report published last week, it pointed out that personal vehicles  cars and two-wheelers  use up more than 75 per cent of the road space in Delhi, but meet only 20 per cent of the citys commuting demand.                     THE TIMES, LONDON

                              The hotel where the girls were killed                            
	New Delhi, July 2: A gynaecologist allegedly killed her two daughters by injecting them with poison before attempting suicide.        
	Rupa Singh, 35, a doctor at Ambedkar Hospital in Rohini, walked out of her Maurya Enclave residence in north-west Delhi last evening with her daughters after an altercation with husband Rajiv Ranjan, a surgeon.         
	Singh checked into a hotel in west Delhis Pitampura with the 3-year-old twins, Tania and Twinkle.         
	The incident came to light when Singh called up her husband saying she was ending her life. Ranjan alerted the hotel staff who went to her room and found the three struggling for life. The employees called police who took them to hospital where Singhs condition was stated to be critical.        
	The police said Singh wanted to set up a hospital. She had a fight with Ranjan on Tuesday night when he said they did not have the money for that.

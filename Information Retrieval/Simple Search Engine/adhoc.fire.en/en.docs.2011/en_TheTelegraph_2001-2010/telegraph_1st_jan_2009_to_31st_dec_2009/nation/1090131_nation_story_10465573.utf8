          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 30: An apex health body today proposed a relaxation in conditions for establishing medical colleges and making rural stints mandatory for doctors who seek postgraduate qualifications beginning next year.        
	The proposals are part of resolutions from the Central Council of Health and Family Welfare, which met today. The council also proposed a national alcohol policy aimed at drawing the youth away from alcohol.        
	Health minister Anbumani Ramadoss said the relaxation for colleges would help expand medical education, particularly in the Northeast.        
	At present, a medical college has to be established on a campus of 25 acres. According to the proposed change, the 25 acres may be distributed at two sites within 10-15km.

                                                                                                               UP stares at 50% paddy slump

	Lucknow, Aug. 14: The paddy yield in Uttar Pradesh is likely to be less than half of last years because of the poor monsoon, the state government has written to the Centre.        
	The letter said that in 58 of the states 71 districts, only 20 per cent of sowing has been successful with the seeds drying up in the rest of the fields. The state government last week declared these 58 districts drought-affected.        
	The state agriculture department has told the Centre that Uttar Pradesh produced 13.1 million tonnes of paddy last year but this year the yield is feared to be as low as 6.2 million tonnes, marking a fall of nearly 53 per cent.        
	The production of maize, the seasons second crop that is sown in early October, is expected to fall even more sharply, the state government says. It estimates a 57 per cent decline  from 11.15 million tonnes last year to less than five million tonnes this year.        
	Officials said the fields would most likely remain dry because of lack of rain when the time comes to sow the maize.        
	The poor rainfall has affected over 50,000 lakh hectares of agricultural land in Uttar Pradesh.        
	Rampur, Etah and Chitrakoot are the three worst-hit districts. Bundelkhand, where drought is endemic, is suffering too, officials said. There isnt a single district in the state where rainfall has been above normal.        
	A central team of officials and agriculture experts is expected to reach the state on Monday to assess the damage. The teams report to the Centre will assess the volume of central aid the state would need.              
	The Mayavati government has demanded over Rs 7,700 crore from the Centre towards drought relief. The state has announced several relief measures, including suspension of revenue collection in the districts declared drought-hit.

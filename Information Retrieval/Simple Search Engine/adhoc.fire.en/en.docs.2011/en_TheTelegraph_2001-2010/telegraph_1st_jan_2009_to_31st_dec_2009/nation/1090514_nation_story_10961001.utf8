The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | EC pats itself on the back
                                                                                                               EC pats itself on the back
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                               
	New Delhi, May 13: The Election Commission today said it was immensely satisfied as early figures after the final phase of voting put the overall turnout at 59-60 per cent.        
	The commission is immensely satisfied about the poll process that took place in five phases. Barring a few incidents of violence, the process has been largely peaceful, said chief election commissioner Navin Chawla, flanked by colleagues S.Y. Quraishi and V.S. Sampath at Nirvachan Sadan.         
	Chawla said 37 people had died in the five phases of polling. In the 2004 elections, 48 people had died.        
	The turnout in the final phase ranged from a high of 75 per cent in Pondicherry and 70 per cent in Bengal to 40-45 per cent in Jammu and Kashmirs Baramullah. The average was 62 per cent.        
	Chawla was careful to share credit with predecessor N. Gopalaswami, who oversaw the first phase on April 16 before retiring on April 20.        
	Gopalaswami had accused Chawla of bias and recommended his removal months before the elections. The Centre rejected the recommendation.        
	The homework of delivering democracy in the remotest of remote locations had started late last year, Chawla said.        
	The process had not ended yet. Election officials were still wading 45km through knee-deep snow to reach two polling stations in Jammu and Kashmir. The polls will be held on May 15 in 39-Ralakung, which has only 23 voters, and 40-Phema, which has 14. They were to be air-lifted but bad weather grounded the plan.        
	We have been intensely preparing over the last five months, Chawla said.         
	The magnitude and the complexities of this exercise are simply mind-boggling. Indian elections are about mobilising millions of human resources; about enrolling 713.77 million voters, about setting up 8.34 lakh polling stations. It is about reinforcing our faith in our electoral system and its efficacy, he added.        
	But he declined to put a figure on the cost of the election. I wont hazard a guess. That figure will have to wait, he said.        
	Chawla suggested that the staggered polls had allowed security forces to be moved around Maoist-infested areas and ensured that the polls took place. He said the move had paid off. We stand by it. If we had to do things again, we would do it exactly the same way.

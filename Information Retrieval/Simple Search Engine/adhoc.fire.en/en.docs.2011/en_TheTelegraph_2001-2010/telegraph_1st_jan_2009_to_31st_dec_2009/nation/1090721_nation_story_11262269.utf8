The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | US clause not new, bid now to cut red tape
                                                                                                               US clause not new, bid now to cut red tape
          OUR BUREAU                          Krishna in Delhi. (Reuters)                                  
	New Delhi, July 20: Foreign minister S.M. Krishna and US secretary of state Hillary Clinton today suggested that they had agreed on end-use verification of arms Americans sell to India.        
	But a senior Indian official said: It is arrangement, not an agreement, drawing a distinction between a common understanding and a process that concludes with the signing of a document.        
	If indeed India has agreed in principle to such verification, it is not the first time New Delhi has signalled its willingness to allow intrusive inspections of US-origin equipment in its arsenal.        
	End-use monitoring or verification for military hardware that the US exports is mandated by US law. India has agreed to its conditions for each of the military weapons or systems it has procured from the US since 2002.        
	Krishna and Hillary have left it to diplomats to work out the fine print of the letters of acceptance that have to be exchanged.        
	Officials would not say how they are working around the sensitive issue of physical on-site verification  inspection of American military systems with India at the place where they are located.        
	The current urgency for the end-use verification agreement (EUVA) is driven by two factors.        
	First, big US companies (such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing) are worried that unless an agreement is reached, they may not be able to grab military business from India  such as an Indian Air Force order of $12 billion-plus for 126 medium multi-role combat aircraft.        
	India is likely to import about $30 billion (Rs 1.44 lakh crore) worth of weapons and platforms in the next five years.         
	Second, the Indian military is also in a hurry to diversify its sources of procurement. Traditionally, India has been dependent on Russia and, even now, more than 60 per cent of its military hardware is of Soviet/Russian origin.         
	Like the US, the European countries and Israel are also very strong competitors for Indian military deals.        
	The current discussions between India and the US were for an omnibus EUVA, at Indias insistence, that will cover all future imports of US military equipment and, therefore, do away with the bureaucratic delay involved in negotiating the agreement for each transaction.        
	A sovereign country can consider the conditions under an EUVA intrusive. As a source in the Indian defence establishment involved in the negotiations put it: Ideally, we would not like to sign such an agreement at all. But we understand the US has its laws and expect that they will understand our concerns.        
	The inspections of military equipment that the US exports are required under its Arms Export Control Act and its Foreign Assistance Act. The laws were further strengthened in the 1990s after the US could not account for the exports of Stinger shoulder-fired missiles channelled to the Afghan Mujahideen through Pakistan in their war against Soviet occupation.         
	In course of time, the Stinger came to be used against US forces post-2001.         
	The US also implements conditions of end-use verification to prevent exports of its military equipment to third countries that may not be friendly to it. In February this year, at the Bangalore air show, the director of the US Pentagons Defence Security Cooperation Agency said the US has such agreements with about 80 countries.        
	US inspectors, sometimes called Tiger Teams, verify the use of weapons and military platforms that have been exported under two programmes called Blue Lantern and Golden Sentry.         
	Under the Blue Lantern programme, inspectors verify equipment sold by a company to the buyer  for instance in the case of P8I Poseidon maritime surveillance aircraft that India has contracted with Boeing.        
	Under the more intrusive Golden Sentry mechanism that governs exports under the Foreign Military Sales  or government-to-government  deals, US inspectors will want to verify the use of US military equipment from cradle-to-grave, that is, from the time of their despatch to their delivery, to their use and to their eventual disposal. This requires physical onsite verification and makes security officials in the Indian establishment touchy.        
	Indian officials say that they can agree to physical verification or a verification through an examination of records. For instance, in the VVIP Boeing Business Jets, they claim that the self-protection suites of the aircraft that the President and Prime Minister fly, among others, will be dismantled before US inspectors board them.        
	But, as in the case of artillery locating radars, India will not agree to inspections in sensitive zones such as those near the Line of Control at Jammu and Kashmir.        
	Among the major projects/equipment that have been delivered by the US for which New Delhi has accepted the conditions of end-use monitoring  despite its reluctance  on a case-by-case basis are:         
	1)12 AN/TPQ 137 Firefinder weapon-locating radars (made by Raytheon) contracted for $146 million in April 2002 (by the NDA government).         
	2) USS Trenton, now the INS Jalashva, landing platform dock, sold by the US to the Indian Navy in 2006 for about $48.44 million.        
	3) Three Boeing Business Jets for VVIP transports with the Indian Air Force headquarters communication squadron contracted for about $937 million plus an additional $40 million for self-protection suites. The aircraft were delivered and are now in use.        
	4) Six Lockheed Martin C-130J Hercules transport aircraft for special operations contracted in 2008 for $1 billion.         
	(All the above are under the Golden Sentry programme.)        
	5) Eight Boeing P8I Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft contracted for the Indian Navy for about $2.2 billion in January this year and selected through a competition in which Boeing pipped EADS Casas Airbus 319. (under the Blue Lantern programme).

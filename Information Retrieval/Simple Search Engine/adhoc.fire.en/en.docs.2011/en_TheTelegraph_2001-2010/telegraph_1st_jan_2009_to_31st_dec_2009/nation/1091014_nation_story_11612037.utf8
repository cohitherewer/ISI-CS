                                                                                                               Naveen calamity letter to PM
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 13: Deploring the Centres step-motherly attitude and continued neglect towards Orissa in releasing calamity assistance, chief minister Naveen Patnaik today demanded release of Rs 2,687 crore from the National Calamity Contingency Fund.        
	In a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today, Naveen said under the federal system, all states are supposed to get equal treatment under identical circumstances. Though the Centre had released a flood assistance of Rs 1,000 crore each to Bihar and Bengal last year and the same amount to Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka recently, Orissa has been meted out different treatment under equal circumstances, he rued.        
	Naveens missive is believed to be an attempt to rake up the bogey of neglect and discrimination to the BJD-ruled Orissa by the Congress-led UPA government at the Centre.        
	Quoting records of the Central Water Commission and meteorology department, Naveen said Orissa had reeled from an unprecedented flood last year. Orissas flood was no less severe, compared to that of Bihar, Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, he said.        
	Orissa had suffered extensive damage due to floods for consecutive three years (2006-2008). The state government had submitted four memoranda to the Centre, following which central teams had visited flood-hit areas on four occasions during the past three years. However, the Centre has not taken any favourable decision for flood-ravaged Orissa, he lamented.        
	The 12th Finance Commission had approved a Calamity Relief Fund of Rs 2,000 crore for Orissa for five years (2005-10). However, an amount of Rs 2,000 crore had already been spent on flood relief and restoration, said the chief minister, stressing on the need for release of special central assistance from the National Calamity Contingency Fund.        
	Naveen recalled that then Union home minister Shivraj Patil had announced sanction of an interim central assistance of Rs 500 crore during his visit to flood-hit areas of Orissa on September 29, 2008. Accordingly, the state government had taken up rehabilitation and restoration works in flood-affected areas. However, only Rs 98.87 crore was released by the Centre from the National Calamity Contingency Fund.

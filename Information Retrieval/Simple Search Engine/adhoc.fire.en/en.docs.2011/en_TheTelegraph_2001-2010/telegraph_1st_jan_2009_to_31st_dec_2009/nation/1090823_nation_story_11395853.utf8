	Raipur, Aug. 22: Frustrated at being denied leave, a jawan of the state police force killed two of his senior colleagues and critically wounding another before hanging himself to death in Bastars Kondagaon this morning.        
	The constable, M. Minj, was posted with the 8th Battalion of the Chhattisgarh Armed Force (CAF)  a company of which had been deployed in Kondagaon police station.         
	The CAF jawans have been deployed in Kondagaon, about 250km south of Raipur, for anti-Maoist operations.        
	According to sources, Minj had been requesting for proceeding on leave for long time, which his superior officers had been denying. The jawan was seen frustrated because of his seniors attitude, the sources added.         
	Around 8am today, Minj entered into a heated exchange with his platoon commander Tikaram Laria on the same issue.         
	The matter took an ugly twist when Minj in a fit of rage opened indiscriminate fire from his rifle.        
	Bastar inspector-general of police T.J. Langkumer said that Laria (54) and head constable Mehtab Singh (55) died on the spot. Another jawan, Sanjay Singh, was seriously injured in the firing, he added.         
	The injured jawan had been admitted to government hospital in Kondagaon. His condition is reported to be critical.         
	A high-level inquiry had been ordered to look into the causes that led to the incident, Langkumer said.         
	Minj later escaped from the police station and returned to the barrack where he hanged himself to death.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PMK ministers in quit queue
                                                                                                               PMK ministers in quit queue
          G.C. SHEKHAR                                        
	Chennai, March 24: Central PMK ministers Anbumani Ramadoss and R. Velu are scheduled to quit this week after their party formally decides to join the ADMK front in Tamil Nadu.        
	The decision on joining will be taken at the PMKs general council meeting on Thursday, following which party founder S. Ramadoss is expected to meet ADMK leader Jayalalithaa and exchange letters about seat-sharing.        
	Later that evening or on Friday morning, health minister Anbumani and junior railway minister Velu will hand over their resignations to the Prime Minister. Anbumani has already met Congress general secretary Ahmed Patel to explain the decision to leave the UPA and fight the elections along with the ADMK.        
	The ADMK has given the PMK seven Lok Sabha seats in Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry, and one Rajya Sabha seat for Anbumani in 2010.         
	The health minister has told the Congress that following the strains in its relations with the DMK in the last two years, it would be difficult for cadres of the two parties to work together in the elections.        
	The DMK had expelled the PMK from its front in Tamil Nadu last April, though the PMK stayed with the UPA.        
	The exit will be a setback for the Congress, which has seen one ally after another dumping it in the heartland.        
	Hoping to balance the PMKs exit, the Congress had hoped to induct actor Vijayakanths DMDK, which had polled 8 per cent of votes in the 2006 Assembly election. But his demand for 10 seats was deemed too high. The actor then announced his party would contest on its own.        
	However, Vijayakanth has reportedly offered not to field candidates against Congress nominees. But the Congress fears such a strategy might cost it the backing of the DMK and its cadres.         
	Another tactic by Vijayakanth could be to field weak candidates in the Congress seats, not to campaign vigorously for them and to get his cadres to transfer his partys votes to the Congress on polling day.        
	Even this may not be relished by the DMK, as Vijayakanth is a bitter critic of the Karunanidhi government. But we have to improve the chances of our candidates as four allies who were with the DMK in 2004 are now with the ADMK, a Congress MP said.        
	But one person who has reason to smile through the tug-of-war is ADMK leader Jayalalithaa, who has successfully weaned four allies of the DMK to her side. This has improved her chances of winning more Lok Sabha seats than the DMK, after having scored a blank in 2004.

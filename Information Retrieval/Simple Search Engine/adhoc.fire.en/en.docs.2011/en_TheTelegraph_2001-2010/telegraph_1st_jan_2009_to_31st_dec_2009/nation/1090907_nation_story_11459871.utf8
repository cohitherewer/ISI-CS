The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Party rectification draft to wait for Buddha 
                                                                                                               Party rectification draft to wait for Buddha 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 6: The CPM has fallen back on its strategy of criticising the Centre on familiar themes in an attempt to position itself as the main Opposition party in place of the faltering BJP.        
	A pointer to the return to old ways came in the statement put out today at the end of the two-day politburo meeting, which focused on the rectification campaign, aimed at correcting lifestyle deviations and bourgeois tendencies among its leaders.        
	Some in the CPM believe these have alienated the party from the people and led to the recent poll setbacks.        
	Today, the proposal for wealth disclosures by local leaders  many of whom have faced allegations of corruption  was debated further after being put forward yesterday. The attempt was to devise a mechanism to verify the information provided by party functionaries, sources said.        
	However, the discussions remained inconclusive. The matter will be taken up at the next politburo meeting on October 11. The draft guidelines on the disclosures will then go to the central committee, which is meeting here from October 23 to 25.        
	The sources said the October 11 meeting was being held to finalise the issue because two key politburo members, Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Kerala party secretary Pinarayi Vijayan, were convalescing or indisposed and couldnt attend the talks. Another member, M.K. Pandhe, ran into travel problems and could come only for todays session.        
	The politburo statement renewed the attack on the Manmohan Singh government, picking on old themes like disinvestment plans and price rise. The Congress-led governments record in the first 100 days of its tenure have confirmed that it will pursue the same neo-liberal policies. It has announced that it will further liberalise foreign direct investment in various spheres, go in for disinvestment of the profitable PSUs on the pretext of ensuring peoples participation in the public sector and provide for further tax concessions to the corporate sector, the statement said.         
	Other points of criticism were shoddy drought relief work, a free-trade pact with Asean and the end-user verification agreement with the US.        
	The politburo didnt pull punches on the BJP either. The RSS had maintained that it will not interfere in the decision-making process of the BJP as it is a cultural organisation. This fiction has been exposed by the manner in which all the BJP leaders were summoned by the RSS chief, the statement said.

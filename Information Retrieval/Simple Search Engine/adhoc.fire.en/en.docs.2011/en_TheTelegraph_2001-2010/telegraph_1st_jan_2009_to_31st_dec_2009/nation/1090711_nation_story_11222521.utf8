          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Raipur, July 10: After Opposition Congress, members of the ruling BJP have now alleged that the seven persons gunned down by security personnel in Dantewada last month were villagers and not Maoist supporters as claimed by the police.         
	On June 20, police killed seven persons in an encounter after Maoist guerrillas killed 12 CRPF personnel in a landmine blast near Tongpal village of Dantewada. Police claimed that the deceased were Maoist supporters.         
	Opposition Congress, however, recently contended the claim, while the BJP legislators from Bastar today spoke on the Opposition line and met chief minister Raman Singh. They demanded a high-level inquiry into the matter and compensation for family members. The ruling party also urged the chief minister to give jobs to a family member each of the killed villagers.         
	Sources said that the chief minister assured that he would look into the demands. The government is now in a quagmire with the Opposition blaming it of security lapse.        
	A delegation of Congress leaders, led by former Opposition leader Mahendra Karma, earlier met chief minister made a similar demanded of an 1nquiry.         
	Now, if the state government orders a probe, the Opposition will get the lee way to grill the Raman Singh government, said a senior police official.

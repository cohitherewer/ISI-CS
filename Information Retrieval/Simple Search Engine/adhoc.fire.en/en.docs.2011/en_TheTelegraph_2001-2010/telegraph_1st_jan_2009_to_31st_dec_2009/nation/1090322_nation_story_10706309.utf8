          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 21: CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan today said his party wouldnt mind taking Congress help for a third alternative after elections but ruled out supporting a Congress-led regime at the Centre.        
	Why should we refuse if somebody wants to support us but it is absolutely clear that we will not support a Congress government in the post-poll scenario, the veteran communist said.        
	Bardhan parried a question on whether the Congress was an untouchable for the Left.         
	Untouchability is a very bad word, he said. Please dont use it. We are fighting against the BJP as also against the Congress.        
	The CPI also leader had a word of caution for the Congress. Bardhan said its so-called grand alliance with Mamata Banerjees Trinamul in Bengal would be very harmful for the party.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 11: B. Ramalinga Raju, the former chairman of Satyam Computer Services, may have surrendered himself to Indian police to evade extradition to the US where class action law suits have been filed against the company, legal experts said today.        
	He is most secure with Indian police. Once he has subjected himself to the Indian courts jurisdiction, the matter is sub-judice. He cant be extradited till the Indian legal process ends, senior Supreme Court lawyer Vivek Tankha said. Now that he is in judicial custody, he cant even be questioned by Indian authorities without the courts permission, he added.         
	Corporate lawyer Sameer Parekh said it was possible that Raju was trying to protect his family and its other companies by giving himself up. As Satyam is a listed company on the New York Stock exchange, the US could have proceeded against Raju. By surrendering, he might be trying to protect his family and his other companies, Parekh said.         
	Raju, 54, was already facing an inquiry by Sebi  a watchdog which cannot arrest anybody  but chose to be arrested at a time and place of his choice. He would obviously have received a greater sentence in the US, Parekh said.        
	For instance, Kenneth Lay of Enron was charged under 11 criminal counts and was set to be sentenced to 45 years in jail when he died of a heart attack. He was 64.         
	The Enron scandal of 2001 is smaller than Satyam in magnitude in more ways than one. Enron had 40,000 employees on its rolls, Satyam has 53,000. The Enron scam involved Rs 2,866 crore (at current exchange rates), Satyams fictitious figures exceed Rs 7,000 crore.         
	US laws on fraud have become even tougher post-Enron. Jeffrey Skilling, Enrons former chief executive, got a jail term of 24 years.         
	Theoretically, Raju could be sentenced to a maximum of a life term but the imprisonment could be limited to 10 years.        
	Even this seems a remote possibility. Section 409 (criminal breach of trust by a public servant or by a banker or merchant or agent) is tried by a magistrate who is empowered to award only three years in jail.         
	Such a case can be transferred under Section 309 of the CrPC from a magistrates court to a sessions court  empowered to award a life term  but that is a rare occurrence in the Indian legal system.

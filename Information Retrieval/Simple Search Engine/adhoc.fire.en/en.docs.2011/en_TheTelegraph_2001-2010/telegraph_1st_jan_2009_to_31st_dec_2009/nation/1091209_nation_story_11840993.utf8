          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                      Sushma                          
	New Delhi, Dec. 8: If a speech could clinch who the next leader of Opposition would be, the verdict in the BJP was Sushma Swaraj had gained an invincible lead over Rajnath Singh.        
	Party chief Rajnath  seen as L.K. Advanis possible successor  achieved his objective of endorsing the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sanghs views on the Babri demolition when he opened the debate on the Liberhan commissions report for his party in the Lok Sabha today. But Sushmas purpose was more overarching.         
	The BJP deputy leader in the House went about demolishing the report by claiming that Justice M.S. Liberhan did not adequately appreciate the evidence he had collected.        
	Sushma, not in Ayodhya when the mosque was pulled down and still on the BJPs periphery in 1992, spoke as though she was a dyed-in-saffron kar sevak.        
	Did kar sevaks dismantle the disputed structure? Yes. Was there a conspiracy? No. Yes, we are ready to take any punishment, those who were present on the site and those who were not. Punish us but dont defer the sentence or qualify it with ifs and buts. Bring the representatives of the two communities on the table, she said.        
	Sushma claimed that Liberhan had contradicted himself in two interviews by saying Atal Bihari Vajpayee was not indicted but he must take responsibility as the companys managing director. If Vajpayee, as managing director, should own up responsibility, what about the then managing director of the Congress, P.V. Narasimha Rao, and the then director (Manmohan Singh) who is now the managing director? Sushma asked.        
	Sushma argued that no investigating agency, including the CBI, had conclusively proved the conspiracy charge. Then how did Justice Liberhan conclude that there was a conspiracy? Just because funds were spent to mobilise the kar sevaks?

                                                                                                               BJPs rigging slur on BJD
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, April 27: The BJP has urged the Election Commission (EC) to conduct an inquiry into the alleged attempts of booth capturing and rigging by BJD at Patkura constituency where BJD MLA from Rourkela was arrested for allegedly trespassing into a polling booth.         
	The ruling party has resorted to all undemocratic means, including large-scale use of money and muscle, to rig the Lok Sabha and Assembly polls, alleged BJP legislature party leader and former industries minister Biswabhusan Harichandan at a news conference today.         
	Our party has already discussed the matter with the states chief electoral officer and will submit a written complaint to the EC soon demanding a thorough probe, he said.         
	BJP national secretary and party MP Dharmendra Pradhan said the party was going to urge the EC to register a case against BJD MP Pyari Mohan Mohapatra as an abettor in the case of alleged attempt of booth capturing and rigging at Talkusuma booth under Patkura Assembly segment.         
	BJD MLA from Rourkela Sarada Prasad Nayak who was arrested for trespassing had admitted that they were sent by BJD poll manager Mohapatra, said Pradhan.         
	Pradhan and Patkura candidate Bijoy Mohapatra met chief electoral officer Alaka Panda yesterday and discussed the allegation. A formal complaint would be lodged with the EC.         
	Mohapatra, who contested from Patkura in Kendrapara, said a group of armed men, led by BJD MLA, barged into Talakusuma booth and threatened voters to vote for BJD brandishing a revolver on Thursday.         
	Though Nayak was arrested for trespassing, he was released under pressure from the ruling party bosses, he alleged.         
	Strangely enough a complaint filed by BJP election agent, polling agent and a villager at a local police station was registered later, while Nayak lodged a complaint at Kendrapara police station which was later transferred to Patkura police station.         
	Demanding effective security at strong rooms, Harichandan said a skeleton police force was guarding the strong room at Bhubaneswar and a ladder was found behind the building. Suspecting tampering of electronic voting machines, Mohapatra demanded immediate shifting of about 6,000 surplus EVMs from the state to prevent possible misuse.

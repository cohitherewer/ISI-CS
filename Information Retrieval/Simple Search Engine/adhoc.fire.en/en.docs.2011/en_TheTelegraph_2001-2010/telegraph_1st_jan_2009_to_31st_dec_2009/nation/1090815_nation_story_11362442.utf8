The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Drought in state? Blame the biscuits
                                                                                                               Drought in state? Blame the biscuits
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Lalu Prasad takes time off his Bodh Gaya speech on Friday. The RJD boss was addressing an LJP camp. (PTI)                                  
	Gaya, Aug. 14: Playing to the gallery today, RJD chief Lalu Prasad said the Bihar chief minister had brought a drought upon the state by eating and drinking during the recent total solar eclipse.        
	Not quite done, the former Bihar chief minister proceeded to say that Nitish mocked established traditions by publicly eating biscuits during the eclipse and even offered the same to others.         
	Consequently, the rain god withheld his gift, while the sun god hid himself at Taregna, the place where thousands had gathered to witness the eclipse.         
	Lalu was speaking at a valedictory function held during the three-day LJP training camp at Bodh Gaya on Friday, where he was invited as the chief guest by LJP boss Ram Vilas Paswan.        
	Lalu carried on as the divine interpreter as he pointed out that the gods have not been happy with Nitish and that the state has been witnessing droughts and floods ever since the latter took reign as the CM.        
	When he did not speak of the drought he reiterated his resolve to swim or sink with LJP. But, both leaders did not speak of a merger, which, political observers point out, would be a logical step if the former foes were genuinely interested in a permanent friendship.        
	Senior RJD leader Shakeel Ahmed Khan cautioned the two against fair weather friends within the party. Khan particularly referred to RJD deserter Shyam Rajak and LJP deserter Sanjay Singh.        
	RJD and LJP would be organising a joint rally in Patna on November 15, 2009, to cement ties between the previously hostile parties.         
	The announcement was made by Ram Vilas Paswan in the presence of RJD boss Lalu Prasad at Bodh Gaya on Friday.

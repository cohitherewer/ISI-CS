          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Raipur, April 16: Widespread Maoist violence marred polling in Chhattisgarh today even as seven persons  including two security personnel  were killed in separate incidents in the state.         
	Eleven Lok Sabha constituencies today went to polls to decide the electoral fate of 178 candidates. About 50-55 per cent polling was recorded when the last figures came in, which could change once the final figure was compiled by late evening, election officials said.         
	However, large scale Maoist violence, despite heavy security measures, stained the democratic process.         
	Rebels detonated a powerful landmine and blew up a jeep carrying the zonal election officer and his team near Kamkasaar in Maanpur block, Rajnandgaon district, in the morning.         
	Five persons, including officer A.K. Acharya, were killed while two others sustained serious injuries.         
	In Dantewada and Bijapur districts, Maoists ambushed polling parties and security personnel at different places. Deputy inspector-general of police (headquarters) Pawan Deo said security personnel and rebels had encounters at more than a dozen places in which two security personnel were killed.         
	Rebels also looted EVMs at 12 places in Bastar and Rajnandgaon regions, Deo said.         
	The state chief electoral officer, Sunil Kujur, said that in Jaipur polling booth of Koriya district, polling had to be suspended after a group tried to capture the booth. In four polling booths  one in Raipur and three in Raigarh district  people boycotted the polling.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Congress toys with friendly fights
                                                                                                               Congress toys with friendly fights
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Rahul Gandhi at Sabarmati Ashram on the 61st death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 30: The Congresss central election committee is expected to meet early next week to finalise the first list of candidates from Uttar Pradesh even as the partys ties with the Samajwadi Party remained tenuous.        
	The Samajwadis have already named 52 candidates for the 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state.         
	Congress sources said the first list could include names for seats for which the Samajwadis have already declared candidates, indicating that friendly fights were on the cards and the alliance may be far from perfect if it eventually materialises.        
	It will be an alliance only in some seats and in some, there will be friendly fights. There are precedents. In the last (Assembly) elections, the Samajwadis conceded four seats to the CPM but the CPM contested six seats on its own, a general secretary said.        
	Sources said that once the Samajwadis had picked their candidates, Uttar Pradesh Congress leaders asked why they should not do the same.        
	Congress president Sonia Gandhi would take the final decision, they added. Indications are that Sonia and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh favour the alliance.        
	When the Congress Working Committee met yesterday, the still-to-be-firmed Uttar Pradesh alliance took up much of the time. Sonia and Rahul Gandhi were silent when members brought up the issue of former BJP leader Kalyan Singhs support to the Samajwadis.         
	But Digvijay Singh, the general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh, said: Our stand is clear, Kalyan Singh is responsible for the Babri demolition. He owned up responsibility and the court has also indicted him. But we also feel its an internal matter of the Samajwadis who they take on board.        
	CWC members argued that if there was an alliance, the Samajwadis would gain much more than the Congress.         
	Lalu Prasad was a scam-tainted Bihar leader who has acquired national and, perhaps, international stature thanks to his being part of a Congress-led government... a member said.        
	If the Samajwadis were to become part of the next government, Mulayam Singh Yadav will gain the same legitimacy and power. But what is the Congress getting in return? Only 15 Lok Sabha seats? We should reflect whether its worth ceding precious political space for such paltry returns.

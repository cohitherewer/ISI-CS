          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 28: The Supreme Court has asked state governments to cover all abandoned borewells and tubewells with wire meshes or lids to prevent children from falling into them, enforcing a basic safeguard that local administrations should have ensured on their own without being prodded.        
	The state governments have also been asked to fence functioning wells as a preventive step.        
	The orders came three years after a child named Prince fell into a borewell in Haryana, triggering live television broadcast that held the country on tenterhooks till he was rescued several hours later. However, several children, such as four-year-old Sonu of Agra, since then have died after falling into holes left uncovered.        
	The court directive is particularly relevant in northern India where the diameter of the wells has been increasing over the years.        
	States (governments) will take steps to see that all abandoned borewells and tubewells are capped by wire meshes or any other means once they are not in use or are abandoned, a bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, said on Friday.        
	This is a problem which has a very simple solution, the Chief Justice said. You just have to put a cap or a mesh on it, he said.         
	The apex court was acting on a letter that had drawn its attention to the problem in northern India. The court had converted this letter which came by post into a public interest litigation.        
	Borewells and tubewells are widely used in Punjab and Haryana for irrigation because of the falling water table. Often, the water sources have to be abandoned after a short span of time and others dug at nearby spots, leaving the area littered with death traps.        
	The apex court order came after the amicus curiae in the case, P.S. Patwalia, pointed out that most of these wells were dug by state-run irrigation departments.        
	Earlier, these were narrow holes. Now they are broader at 18 to 24 inches. Most of these are left uncapped once they fall into disuse, he said, accusing state governments of failing in their duty to close them.        
	Appearing for the Union government, additional solicitor-general Indira Jaisingh said the government had set up a committee to look into the problem.        
	Its suggestions have been received. The Union government will take action to tackle the problem based on some of the suggestions.         
	The court then adjourned the hearing to enable the states to state their position on the recommendations.         
	President Pratibha Patil had earlier expressed concern over the deaths of several children after they had fallen into abandoned borewells and had asked the ministries of rural development, and water resources and the Central Ground Water Board to deal with the problem.        
	She had written to the ministries after the death of Sonu. He was trapped in a 150-ft-deep borewell and died after 96 hours.

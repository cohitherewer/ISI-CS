The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PM plays practical card on Pak
                                                                                                               PM plays practical card on Pak
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                           Manmohan Singh                                  
	Srinagar, Oct. 29: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said his demand for dismantling the terror infrastructure across the border was not a pre-condition for initiating talks with Pakistan but a practical way of looking at things.         
	It is not a pre-condition. Negotiations, which are essential and for which we are prepared, cannot make much headway unless Pakistan brings under effective control these terrorist groups, he said. We are a democracy. If day in and day out, there are terrorist attacks which continue to take precious lives, we cannot create requisite conditions for meaningful negotiations.        
	Singhs comments came on a day US secretary of state Hillary Clinton appealed to India and Pakistan to resolve their differences for the benefit of regional trade. But Clinton, on a visit to Pakistan, added in Lahore that the issues between the two countries could only be settled bilaterally.        
	The Prime Minister, sticking to his policy of appearing reasonable but with a firm hand, said in Srinagar that India was a victim of terrorism aided and abetted from Pakistani soil. He made it clear that he wasnt satisfied with the Pakistani probe into last Novembers Mumbai attack.        
	Singh rejected the contention of the neighbouring country that New Delhi was involved in funding the Taliban or inciting violence in Balochistan. He referred to the statements of an important Pakistani minister that India was inciting the Balochistan trouble. The allusion was to interior minister Rahman Malik who had said he had evidence to corroborate his claims.        
	The Prime Minister said he sincerely hopes that Pakistan would create an atmosphere for negotiations which can lead to fruitful end results. For the confidence building measures to move forward, we require (the) cooperation of Pakistan and its people. We are ready to discuss all these issues.        
	Singh regretted the decision of the Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC) to appoint a special envoy for Kashmir. We have lodged a protest with the OIC. We are not going to be induced to work by pressure and we dont accept it.         
	On the separatists, Singh iterated his stand that they should respond favourably to his appeal for talks.         
	I still believe that all the groups who have the good and well-being of people of Jammu and Kashmir in their hearts will respond favourably to my appeal (made yesterday). We are willing to engage with every group provided they shun the path of violence, said Singh, speaking at a news conference here before winding up his two-day visit to the state.        
	The talks offer drew mixed reactions from the Hurriyats two factions. Since (the) PM has called for sincere dialogue, it carries weight but we dont want dialogue for the sake of dialogue. It should be purposeful and productive, said Abdul Gani Bhat, chairman of the moderate faction of the Hurriyat Conference.         
	But Hurriyat hardliner Syed Ali Shah Geelani said he opposed talks unless New Delhi accepted that a dispute existed over Kashmir.        
	The Prime Minister declared the era of violence in the state was coming to an end, the statement coming on a day two encounters left three militants dead.        
	Asked about a Hurriyat leaders recent statement that the gun had not lost its relevance in Kashmir, Singh tried to make light of it by saying it was a remark made in anger and that one shouldnt read too much into it.        
	I return today fully satisfied with my visit. I believe a new chapter is opening in the peace process in the state and we are turning the corner, Singh, who met leaders of all major mainstream parties during his visit, said.

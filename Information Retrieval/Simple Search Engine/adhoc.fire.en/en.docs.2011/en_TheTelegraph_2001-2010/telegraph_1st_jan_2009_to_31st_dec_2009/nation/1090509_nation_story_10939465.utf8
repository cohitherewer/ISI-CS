The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Short of mediators, Cong misses 2004 trio
                                                                                                               Short of mediators, Cong misses 2004 trio
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                  VP Singh, Harkishen Singh Surjeet, Chandra Shekhar: Lost friends                                 
	If dead men could be resurrected, the Congress would give anything to bring them back in its midst.        
	Faced with the prospect of stitching up another coalition after May 16, sources were no longer sure that smaller outfits would naturally gravitate towards the Congress based on the principles of secularism and inclusiveness.        
	We may have to sweat it out because regional parties cant be taken for granted if they add up to a considerable block. Pressure tactics and muscle-flexing will be at work, a source said.        
	But it wasnt the arduousness of this task that fazed the Congress as much as the dearth of political heavyweights who could be trusted to mediate with friends, old and new, and bring them on board.        
	A Congress general secretary recalled that in 2004 Harkishen Singh Surjeet, V.P. Singh and Chandra Shekhar were up and about, shepherding state parties towards a secular coalition that would be led by Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh.        
	Surjeet put together the nuts and bolts, V.P. Singh reached out to parties like the DMK and Chandra Shekhar created the atmospherics against the BJP, he remembered.        
	He noted that while the Lefts problem with the Congress was impelled by ideology and policies, the issue was largely personal with the late Prime Ministers from Uttar Pradesh.         
	But Chandra Shekharji and V.P. Singhji put the past behind them and rallied around Soniaji because they realised the need of the hour was to keep the BJP out, a source said.        
	With the three leaders dead and gone, Congress sources wondered who could fill in for them.        
	NCP leader Sharad Pawar forayed into building bridges between the Left and the Congress by issuing statements on how no government could be formed without Left support and how the matter on who would be Prime Minister should be settled after the polls.         
	Pranab Mukherjee, one of the Congresss principal strategists, rejected Pawars proposal and said it was not possible for the two parties to come together at this juncture.        
	Another leader, privy to the strategy sessions, said one reason why Sonia had declared Manmohan as the Congresss prime ministerial candidate was to thwart speculation about alternative names, if any ally sought one.        
	We are clear as of now. If we are the single largest party, Manmohan will be our candidate. Since he was projected as one, the mandate will be taken to mean one for him. His choice is non-negotiable, we will not be dictated to by another party, the leader said.                    
	The Congress was sceptical of Pawars intention. Sources wondered if his exertions were a cover to push himself as one of the contenders for the top job.        
	With this ground rule laid out, sources said that seeking out the Left would require the collective skills and acumen of Surjeet, V.P. Singh and Chandra Shekhar put together.        
	The sources said Sonia and Manmohan were unlikely to step into the alliance picture before others did the spadework and ensured that a relationship would endure.        
	Asked who would take the first step if it became inevitable to reach out to the Left, a source said: Pranab Mukherjee? He is our only bet but it appears that Prakash Karat is in no mood to relent. We burnt our fingers once in imagining that the CPM was divided and one section could be worked on and Karat could be side-stepped. His writ runs large and we cannot pin our hopes on Jyoti Basu or Sitaram Yechury or Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.        
	On the Congresss drawing board were plans to wean away the secular JD(U) from the NDA and work out a mutually convenient arrangement with the Biju Janata Dal. In case the BJD is short of numbers in the state we could bail them out in return for their support to our government at the Centre, a source said.        
	The only person the Congress could think of to implement its ideas was former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, now a party general secretary credited with political sagacity and realpolitik skills.

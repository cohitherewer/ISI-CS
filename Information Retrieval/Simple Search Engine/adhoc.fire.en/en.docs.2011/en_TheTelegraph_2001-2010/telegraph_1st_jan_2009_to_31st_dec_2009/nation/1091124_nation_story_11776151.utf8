          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Nov. 23: A day before Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar was slated to publish his governments annual report card, Lalu Prasad and the RJD issued a chargesheet against the NDA government, accusing it of failing on all fronts.        
	Interestingly, the RJD gave 20 out of 100 marks in a subject mentioned as road construction in the so-called mark sheet, appended to the last page of the 63-page chargesheet.         
	The paltry 20 that the chief minister obtained, thanks to Lalus examiners, was in the road construction sector and happens to be the highest in comparison to other sectors. Nitish, however, has flunked his tests in total.        
	The RJD has awarded the government a solid zero in land reforms and investment sectors. The chief minister has obtained 15 each in rural development and crime control while he has scored only five each in Scheduled Caste welfare, education, agriculture and irrigation and electricity.         
	Nitish has fared relatively better in the health sector where he received a 10. His total score is a mere 80 on 1,000  a poor record for which he would have been failed in any school.        
	After failing in the Lalu Prasad development school, the chief minister will bring out his own version of a report card tomorrow (November 24) the day he had taken over the reigns of the state from Rabri Devi government, bringing in the 15-year-old regime to an end. In the past four years, Nitish has published a white paper on his governments performance every November 24. Incidentally, tomorrows report card would be the chief ministers last in the present tenure.        
	The RJD chargesheet also stated: In course of its four years in office, the NDA government drove a death nail to democracy and legislative traditions. The state is in the grip of anarchy.        
	It also alleged that the bureaucracy was ruling the roost in the state and peoples voice was gagged. The Nitish government has all the elements of a dictatorship.        
	The states roads, according to the chargesheet, were crumbling as officials in connivance with contractors were busy looting state funds and using sub-standard material.        
	The Naxalites, the chargesheet stated: are blowing up block offices, police stations and public property at will. The spiralling prices of essential commodities have pushed the masses to starvation.

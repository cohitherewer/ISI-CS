The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | China frowns on Dalai trip 
                                                                                                               China frowns on Dalai trip 
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                          Dalai Lama                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 12: Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama is on course for a visit to Arunachal Pradesh despite Chinese opposition to his trip to the north-eastern border state that Beijing claims is its territory.        
	Sources said unless the ministry of external affairs in Delhi developed cold feet, the Buddhist monk would visit Tawang and other places in Arunachal in the second week of November.        
	They (the Chinese) are opposed to everything that His Holiness does. He is going there on invitation from the people of Arunachal Pradesh and would be visiting more than one place for teachings, the Dalai Lamas personal secretary, Chimme Choekyappa, told The Telegraph from Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh, the seat of the Tibetan government-in-exile.        
	Sources said the Dalai Lama could have visited Arunachal next month but the trip got deferred because of scheduled state elections on October 13.        
	Chinas foreign ministry reacted with strong concern over the intended visit as soon as it was announced.        
	China expresses strong concern about this information. The visit further reveals the Dalai cliques anti-China and separatist essence, Jiang Yu, spokesperson for Chinas foreign ministry, said in a statement faxed to Reuters. We firmly oppose Dalai visiting the so-called Arunachal Pradesh.        
	The announcement of the spiritual leaders travel plan came a week after he completed a visit to Taiwan, a self-ruled island claimed by Beijing. China denounced the trip.        
	Leaders from Arunachal said they were strongly in favour of a visit by the Dalai Lama, who 50 years ago had entered India through the state when he fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule.        
	Congress MP Takam Sanjoy said the Tibetan leader, who has been to Arunachal four times since entering India, had thousands of followers in the state. Moreover, he had no political mission, he said.        
	I am a member of the standing committee on external affairs and in a position to say, Sanjoy said from state capital Itanagar on the possibility of the foreign ministry objecting to the Dalai Lamas visit. The state government and the people are preparing to welcome His Holiness who is a world citizen. Arunachal is on earth, it is not another planet.

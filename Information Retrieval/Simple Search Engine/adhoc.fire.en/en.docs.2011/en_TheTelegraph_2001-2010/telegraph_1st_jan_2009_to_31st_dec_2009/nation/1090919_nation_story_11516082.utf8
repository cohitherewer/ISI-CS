                                                                                                               SC panel huddle on Karnataka judge
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 18: The Supreme Court collegium met today to discuss objections to Karnataka Chief Justice P.D. Dinakarans proposed elevation to the apex court, but did not reach any decision.        
	The Supreme Court collegium met today. The issue was discussed but no decision has been taken, a Supreme Court source said.         
	The meeting happened on a day jurists submitted a representation against Dinakaran to law minister Veerappa Moily.         
	Dinakarans name was one of five recently sent by the collegium to the law ministry. But members of the Tamil Nadu bar sent a memorandum to jurists Fali S. Nariman and former law minister Shanti Bhushan opposing Dinakarans elevation.        
	Bhushan and Nariman met the Chief Justice of India, K.G. Balakrishnan, following which Dinakaran was summoned by the CJI who sought an explanation from the judge. Todays collegium meeting was a follow-up to that meeting.         
	According to the procedure, the names of the judges, once finalised by the collegium, are sent to the law ministry for vetting by the Intelligence Bureau. From there, the names go to the PMO and then to the President who approves the names.         
	At any stage, the government may choose to send the names back for reconsideration, but it usually goes by the recommendation of the collegium if the same names are sent the second time.         
	Members of the Tamil Nadu bar claim Dinakarans integrity is suspect as he has allegedly amassed over 700 acres violating state land ceiling laws and other assets disproportionate to his income. Dinakaran has denied the charges.

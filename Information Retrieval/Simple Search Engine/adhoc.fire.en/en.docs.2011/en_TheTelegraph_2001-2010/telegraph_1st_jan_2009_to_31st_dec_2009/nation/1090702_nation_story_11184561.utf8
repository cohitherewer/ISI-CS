The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nudge for Maoist ban
                                                                                                               Nudge for Maoist ban
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                           Chidambaram in Hyderabad on Wednesday. (AP)                                  
	New Delhi, July 1: The Centre today appeared to question Bengals wisdom of not clamping its own ban on Maoists and suggested the state would have been unable to reclaim parts of Lalgarh without central forces.        
	The fresh nudge for a state ban came from home minister P. Chidambaram, who cited a 1908 law under which such a bar could be imposed besides the central ban clamped last week.        
	A home ministry note underscored the need for such a measure. While the central government has listed the CPI (Maoist) as a terrorist organisation, there is still need for the government of Bengal to declare the CPI (Maoist) as an unlawful association, the document understood to have been sent to Writers Buildings said.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has been saying it is up to the state how to implement the central ban. But Chidambaram had reminded him during their meeting last month that a state ban was also necessary.        
	Chidambarams comments came as he presented his ministrys June report card  a monthly dossier on key developments. It dubbed the Lalgarh crisis the most important event in the period.        
	The minister cited the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1908, directed at those who encourage, aid or commit acts of violence or intimidation. The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, under which the Centre dubbed the CPI (Maoist) a terror outfit, is aimed at organisations and individuals that support secession, Chidambaram pointed out.         
	By contrast, the 1908 act doesnt cover secession, but only violence or intimidation. Since Naxalites arent secessionists, the state can ban them under this law, the home minister argued.         
	Asked if Bengal was dithering on the ban, he said: Who am I to comment on the wisdom of the Bengal government? He was less equivocal yesterday, when he said the chief minister was undecided on the ban even after the crisis.        
	Today, he put the role of the central forces in focus. I am glad to report the central forces have ably assisted Bengal police in reclaiming most of the territory that had been dominated by the CPI (Maoist) for nearly eight months.

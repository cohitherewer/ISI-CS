          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Enjoy at a price                                  
	Cuttack, Aug. 4: Cuttack Municipal Corporation (CMC) is proposing to introduce a user fee under which wedding parties will have to pay up Rs 1,000 as toll for taking out processions.        
	The fee would be used to fund civic development programmes.         
	Currently, for a wedding procession permission has to be sought from the sub-collectors office through the police station. But, under the user-fee concept, families will have to register with the CMC for the procession and pay a toll on an hourly basis. The council will certainly give a second thought to the levy, said mayor Saumendra Ghosh.        
	The CMC can go ahead with the proposal only if its 54-member elected council approves of the norm to fall under User Development Fee (UDF), which is also planning to introduce parking fee and additional levy on house owners. The body plans to raise at least Rs 3 crore annually for the CMC to spend on re-paving, reconstructing and modernising roads and drains.         
	Mayor Ghosh confirmed that the corporation had proposed to levy a user fee on residents. The home fee proposal was submitted during a council meeting held on July 30. The council would take a decision at a special meeting, said the mayor, talking to The Telegraph today.        
	The UDF proposal envisages fixation of an annual fee of Rs 100 for owners of residential premises and commercial premises (Rs 200 for two-storeyed homes) in addition to the existing holding tax. Slum-dwellers and squatters will have to pay Rs 50 annually.         
	According to the proposed user fee, Cuttack motorists would have to pay fee of Rs 10 for every hour. While a levy of Rs 3 per hour has been proposed for autorickshaws, scooters and motorcycles would have to pay Rs 2. Bicyclists have not been spared and they have to pay up Re 1.         
	Ghosh said the council was also keen on levying user fee on hotels and restaurants and on hospitals and nursing homes for removing garbage and solid waste.

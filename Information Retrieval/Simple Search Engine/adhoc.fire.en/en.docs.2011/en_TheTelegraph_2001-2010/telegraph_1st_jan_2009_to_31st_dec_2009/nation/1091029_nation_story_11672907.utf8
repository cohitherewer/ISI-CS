The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong defends ally Mamata
                                                                                                               Cong defends ally Mamata
          SANJAY K. JHA                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 28: The Congress today condemned Maoists for unleashing a reign of terror and said no government would tolerate the unthinking madness, the volley prompted by its exasperation with the rising rebel violence.        
	The expression of outrage came with a stout defence of ally and railway minister Mamata Banerjee from the Lefts allegation that she had links with the guerrillas. The Lefts charges were described as absurd, outlandish, mindless, wild and baseless.        
	Senior Congress leaders feel no sensitive person can hail the Maoists as heroes after the brazen challenge to the state. Even the Trinamul chiefs initial vacillations, they feel, have given way to a reasoned approach. Mamata cannot support mindless violence. She does not support Maoist approach and she has conveyed this to the home minister, a senior leader told The Telegraph.        
	The partys public defence of the railway minister came despite some misgivings about her public posturing over the past few months.        
	Asked if Mamata had not been singing a tune that wasnt in harmony with the Centres approach, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said: The words, the idiom and the language of each party cannot be the same. But this doesnt mean Mamata was supporting Maoists. The government evolves a policy through a consultative process and that becomes the unified strategy despite initial differing views.         
	Singhvi blasted the CPM for accusing Mamata of striking a political alliance with the Maoists.        
	Nobody should weaken the national resolve and national focus by indulging in partisan blame-game and politicking at this stage. They have made a baseless and wild allegation as there is no question of complicity with the Maoists at any level.         
	Asked about Mamatas role in the Singur and Nandigram agitation when several Naxalite outfits were suspected to have extended support, Singhvi suggested that the alleged links didnt exist. Dont try to link the unlinkable. Singur and Nandigram were different issues which had nothing to do with Maoist violence against the state.        
	Other Congress leaders also feel that being a Naxalite sympathiser and complicity with the Maoists are different things. You can stage a dharna or take out a rally in support of a peaceful settlement of an issue. Thats different from supporting abduction, loot and murder, another leader said.        
	Singhvi said it was a tragic invocation of the common man by Maoists to indulge in mindless violence.        
	What kind of purpose for the common man is served by death and destruction of this kind? The Maoists are anti-people, anti-development and anti-poor. They block development and then militarise the poor people against lack of development. This will serve no purpose and they should come to negotiate with the government.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hello, Singh amp; Sonia calling
                                                                                                               Hello, Singh amp; Sonia calling
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi at Shanti Van on the death anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru. (AFP)                                          
	New Delhi, May 27: Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi today ended the agony of 59 MPs with a phone call  to invite them into the new council of ministers.        
	The MPs  44 of them from the Congress  were told they would be sworn in at 11.30am tomorrow, ending days of suspense since the May 16 verdict. Those who were outside the capital were asked to reach on time.         
	The Prime Minister spoke first, saying how happy he was to have them in his ministry. He then handed over the phone to Sonia, who largely repeated what he had conveyed. Each call lasted a minute.         
	The calls were not unannounced, with Sonia and the Prime Minister deciding to spare their frazzled MPs an added bout of nerves. The MPs were informed by an official sufficiently in advance they would be phoned on their landline numbers at the appointed time and should answer quickly.          
	The synchronised operation took care of the glitches of 2004. Singh and Sonia had then called separately and sometimes without notice. The result was that some MPs managed to speak to only one of them and were left wondering if the other leader had endorsed their appointment.         
	Some chosen ones were informed they had been promoted.        
	Kumari Selja, 46, was one. The minister of state with independent charge of housing and urban poverty alleviation in the last government was thrilled she had been given cabinet rank. Selja, who at 28 had been the youngest minister in P.V. Narasimha Raos government, was so excited she ended up congratulating people who called to greet her.        
	Pawan Kumar Bansal, 60, got a double promotion. A junior minister in the last finance ministry, he was hoping to be rewarded independent charge as minister of state for his seniority, repeated Lok Sabha wins and the perception that he had delivered. Instead, he was surprised with cabinet rank.        
	Prithviraj Chavan and Sriprakash Jaiswal, too, had reason to smile. Till yesterday, they were reconciled to keeping their old jobs as junior ministers. Although they remain ministers of state, both have been given independent charge.        
	Pradeep Jain, from Bundelkhand in Uttar Pradesh, would have got a surprise. His name wasnt being talked of. But Jain had done the spadework for Rahul Gandhis farmers agitation in Bundelkhand.         
	When Pratik Patil, a young MP from Maharashtra and grandson of legendary Maratha leader Vasantdada Patil, phoned a heavyweight from his state today, the latter thought it was to congratulate him. Imagine his surprise when Pratik told him he too had received the call.

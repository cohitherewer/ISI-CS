	Ahmedabad, Dec. 20: A rush of devotees wanting to enter a Krishna temple in Gujarat caused a stampede in which eight women died this evening.        
	The Gopalnath temple in Dhoraji, about 70km from Rajkot city, was to open its doors at 7pmfor aarti and darshan  the time is considered auspicious.         
	About 10,000 devotees had gathered in a hall, not big enough to hold such a large number of people. But there was a delay in opening the entrance after which the devotees began to jostle for space so that they would be able to get in first for the darshan.        
	The moment the door opened there was a surge to enter.         
	The eight women died of suffocation, police said.        
	Fifteen people were injured and admitted to hospitals in Dhoraji and Rajkot city and are said to be in stable condition. Dhoraji is in Rajkot district.        
	Rajkot collector Haribhai Patel, who confirmed the eight deaths, said there was no lapse by the administration in making arrangements for the devotees, who were to get an elaborate prasad after the puja.         
	Local Congress leaders blamed the administration for poor arrangements.

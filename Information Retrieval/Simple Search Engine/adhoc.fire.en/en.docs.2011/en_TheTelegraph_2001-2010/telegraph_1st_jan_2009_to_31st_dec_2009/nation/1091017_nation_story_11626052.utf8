The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Toxic row over US ship
                                                                                                               Toxic row over US ship
  - Activists allege vessel contains radioactive substances          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           The Platinum II off Saurashtra on Friday. (PTI)                                        
	Ahmedabad, Oct. 16: Environmentalists are seeing red over a US ship seeking permission to be dismantled in Gujarat, saying the vessel is contaminated with radioactive substances while the state green board has claimed the material is not hazardous.         
	The ship, Platinum II, a former luxury liner that has apparently been purchased by a Gujarat merchant, is anchored off the Saurashtra coast waiting for clearance to beach at Alang, around 210km south-west of Ahmedabad.        
	Environmentalists have warned that a huge disaster is imminent if the vessel sinks or is dismantled at the ship-breaking yard at Alang, in Bhavnagar district. But the Gujarat Pollution Control Board, which inspected the ship and submitted a report last week, said there was nothing hazardous in the vessel.        
	Union minister Jairam Ramesh yesterday ordered an inquiry into reports that the ship is anchored off Alang.        
	A Gujarat Pollution Control Board member today said it had not cleared the dismantling of the ship. We have sent our reports to higher-ups to seek their opinion, said G. Patel, the boards Bhavnagar regional official, who inspected the ship on October 8.         
	Patels claim differed from the assertion of S.K. Nanda, the states principal secretary, forests and environment, who said the clearance had been given for dismantling Platinum II.         
	Our people have seen the vessel and examined it from all angles. On our part, we have given the clearance as we have found nothing hazardous on Platinum II, which should be allowed to be dismantled at the Alang ship-breaking yard, said Nanda.         
	Asked why the Centre had chosen to send its own team for investigation, Nanda said maybe Delhi wished to be sure. Perhaps, the Centre wants to double-check. It does not want to take a chance, he said.         
	The pollution control boards report, sent to the Union ministry for environment and forest, says the vessel does not contain any hazardous material, as claimed by environmental activists, except asbestos and paint, both of which can be removed.         
	According to Supreme Court guidelines, both these materials can be removed and the ship can be given clearance for beaching, Nanda said.         
	A five-member team of the board, which submitted the report, found that the vessel did have about 210 tonnes of asbestos-containing material, but no loose hazardous substance.        
	The Indian Platform on Ship-Breaking, a coalition of environment, health, labour and human rights organisations, has claimed that the ship, besides the asbestos, also contains polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), a highly toxic substance, in the form of insulated wiring.         
	The 18,503-tonne Platinum II has nine decks and the capacity to carry 1,021 passengers.         
	The environmentalists say the ship should have been detoxified at its point of origin in the US and now wants Washington to recall the vessel in the same way the French had recalled Le Clemenceau.

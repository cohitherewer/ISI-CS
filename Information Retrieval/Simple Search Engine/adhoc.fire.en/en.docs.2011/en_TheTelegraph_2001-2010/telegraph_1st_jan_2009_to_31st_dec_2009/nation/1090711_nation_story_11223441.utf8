	Rome, July 10: India senses in the economic crisis snagging the West a fresh opportunity to push for a more central and effective role in international financial and governance institutions.         
	New Delhi continues to tread cautiously on the specific issue of its claim to a permanent seat in the UN Security Council (UNSC), but a new Indian thrust for international high tables across the board has clearly emerged from the LAquila summit.         
	Indeed, even before arriving here, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had outlined mounting Indian ambitions in a short vision treatise he wrote for a volume being put together by the Silvio Berlusconi premiership.         
	The deficiencies of the existing system of governance have been dramatically brought home during the recent international financial and economic crisis, Singh wrote, adding that the world does not have a structure which is functionally efficient and capable of dealing with the complex challenges the world faces today.        
	The Security Council has not changed at all and its present structure poses serious problems of legitimacy. It is obvious that if the system (UNSC) was being designed today it would be very different. While problems have long been recognised, efforts to reform the system have made little headway.        
	Asked where the issue of reforms to include claims of emerging economies on political and financial issues stood after the G8-G5 conclave at LAquila, foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon said: For me the impressive thing  and this is partly a result of the economic crisis  is that there is broad recognition that we really need to work these institutions, we need to change them.        
	Menon recalled the commitment made at the April G20 summit in London that voting shares in financial institutions would be revised.         
	Asked whether the LAquila declaration gave hope for changes to the UNSC, Menon said: This is an expression of will, ultimately we will have to go out and (do) work in each of these organisations, we still have to do the hard work in the UN.        
	Indias claim to the permanent position in the UNSC has found widespread lip-support internationally but not enough substantive backing. But reconstituting the UNSC is not an India-specific issue and expansion lies mired in so many claims and counter-claims that permanent members continue to favour status quo.         
	But even so, major emerging economies like India believe that the current financial crisis  and the consequent softening of industrialised nations on international forums  is an opportunity to take the democratisation campaign forward.         
	To that extent, New Delhi believes it has extracted more than satisfactory takeaways from LAquila. The joint declaration itself was a victory for us, but only in content and tone, said a member of the Indian delegation.        
	If you look at the print carefully, several sections have echoed the Prime Ministers pre-summit statement almost word to word. It is clear that the industrialised world has realised it cannot afford to ignore the concerns of the developing nations, in fact, they will have to yield more and more where we make them see reason because at the moment they probably need us more than the other way round.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Arjun caught in code storm
                                                                                                               Arjun caught in code storm
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                          Arjun: In a hurry                                  
	April 18: The human resource development ministry has initiated the selection of the second-in-command of Indias university system more than a month after the elections were announced, triggering allegations of poll code violation.        
	The ministry meets on Monday to select a vice-chairman for the University Grants Commission, and one of Arjun Singhs favourites is a front runner, The Telegraph has learnt. Ministry officials refused to formally reveal details of the meeting, being held under a cloud of secrecy, but sources confirmed the meeting and said Arjun was keen to make the appointment before he quit as HRD minister.        
	The sources accepted that the ministry appeared eager to appoint the National University for Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA) vice-chancellor, Ved Prakash, to the post.        
	Prakash is one of just a handful of former HRD minister M.M. Joshis appointees who was retained in a senior administrative post in education by Arjun. He is known to be close to Arjun, who backed him even against allegations of caste bias and corruption during an earlier stint as UGC secretary.        
	The decision to make the vice-chairmans appointment without publicising the post or the details of the selection panel has triggered protests from senior academics.        
	Former NUEPA registrar P.R.R. Nair has written to the chief election commissioner asking him to stall the appointment process and haul up the HRD ministry for violation of the model code of conduct. Nair now teaches at the Indira Gandhi National Open University.        
	In his letter to the poll panel chief, Nair argued that the appointment of vice-chairman of the UGC will affect the higher education system of the country. So, he said, the appointment process cannot be initiated once the poll code is enforced.        
	This newspaper has a copy of the letter, dated April 17. The poll code of conduct had kicked in the moment the Election Commission had notified elections on March 2.        
	HRD ministry sources argued that the code does not expect the government to stop functioning and does not apply to necessary administrative decisions, including selections to key posts. Only last month, however, the commission had cited the introduction of the code to order the Centre to refrain from appointing a member to the central water commission.        
	Besides, ministry sources failed to explain the urgency behind filling the vice-chairmans post, given the known risk of inviting charges of poll code violation. Both the UGC chairman and secretary have officiating powers to temporarily handle a vice-chairmans responsibilities.        
	The post of UGC vice-chairman fell vacant on February 28. On March 2, the day the poll code came into force, Ved Prakash was handed additional charge as officiating UGC vice-chairman through a government notice.

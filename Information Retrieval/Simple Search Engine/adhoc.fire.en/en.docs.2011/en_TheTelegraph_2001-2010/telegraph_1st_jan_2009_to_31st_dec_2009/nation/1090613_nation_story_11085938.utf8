	Cuttack, June 12: State teachers are concerned over the dropout rate in Orissa.        
	Education departments statistics suggest that nearly 63 per cent of students are leaving school before completing Class VIII. This is a warning that the government should do something, said Kishore Kumar Panda, the general secretary of Orissa Secondary Schoolteachers Association.        
	An analysis of the education scenario revealed that almost 9 lakh students (of the 54 lakh students) within the eligible group were not enrolling into primary schools because they had no schools nearby.        
	A majority of the 45 lakh children who managed to enrol in the 53,818 primary schools were also in a predicament as 700-odd of the schools functioned without classrooms, 6,000 had combined classes for Classes III, IV and V in a single room, while 13,000-odd had two classrooms to function in. More so, only 13,000 schools taught till Classes VI and VII. The (drop out) rate fluctuates between 41.2 per cent in primary level (Class I-V) and 62.63 per cent in elementary level (Classes I-VIII), Panda said. Its higher in case of ST students, he added. The latest survey indicates a requirement of 10,000 more upper-primary schools to improve the situation. The states Education Vision-2020 had estimated a requirement of 54,000 primary and 27,000 upper-primary schools to bring children between five to 10 years to schools.        
	National Campaign for Early Childhood Care and Education Right convenor Bikash Das feels that lack of facilities for pre-primary education could be one of the reasons for the drop out rates.

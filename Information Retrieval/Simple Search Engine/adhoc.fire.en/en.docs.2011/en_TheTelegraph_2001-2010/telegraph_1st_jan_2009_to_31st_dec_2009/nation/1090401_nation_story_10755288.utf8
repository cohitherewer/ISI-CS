The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong loses sleep over south twins 
                                                                                                               Cong loses sleep over south twins 
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Congress chief Sonia Gandhi: Worried?                                  
	New Delhi, March 31: Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu are giving the Congress sleepless nights.        
	The Congresss assessment is that it can afford to be phlegmatic about Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, worry a little about Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra, but watch out for smoke signals from Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.         
	The inference has been drawn after the churning within what is virtually a defunct UPA now, as well as the departure of some key allies.        
	Andhra and Tamil Nadu together brought the Congress 77 Lok Sabha seats in 2004. The party picked up 33 of 42 seats in Andhra on its own and won all the 10 it contested with the DMK and its erstwhile allies in Tamil Nadu.         
	The partys reading is that Tamil Nadu may end in a nightmare for it and ally DMK this time. But the picture in Andhra is not hopeless, provided (YS) Rajasekhar Reddy can convert his governments achievements into a pro-incumbency sentiment and paper over caste divisions, a source said.        
	The simultaneous Assembly and Lok Sabha polls (in Andhra) could work to our advantage because if our MLAs are charged up about winning another term, their hard work will be reflected in the parliamentary fights. But if there is a sentiment against the state government, we have had it in the Lok Sabha elections, a central minister said.        
	The sources said they had initially not been able to suss out the Chiranjeevi factor and assess whether his Praja Rajyam party was damaging the Congress or the Telugu Desam more. Later, they acknowledged the huge turnouts at the actors meetings were significant. An optimistic calculation is that the Congress could lose 12 to 13 seats in Andhra.        
	Among the states where the Congress is looking at substantive gains are Kerala, Punjab, Bengal and Rajasthan. Marginal increases are expected in Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.         
	Maharashtra has been classified a status quoist case, provided the Congress and its ally, the NCP, co-operate reasonably well. The sources admitted the possibility of losing seats in Gujarat, Assam and Jharkhand.         
	The silver lining in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar is that while we may have lost allies, hopefully only temporarily, our party units all over the (two) states will be reactivated, the source said.

	Lucknow, Feb. 21: Three gunmen shot dead two undertrial prisoners from a rival gang near a court in Uttar Pradesh today before police killed the trio who appeared out of nowhere on motorbikes.        
	Additional director-general of police Brij Lal said the two undertrials  Kamlesh and Satyaveer  were being brought to a court in Hathras, now renamed Mahamayanagar, 55km from Aligarh.        
	Police sources said the three men, who were on motorcycles, emerged from the blue when a jeep carrying the undertrials neared the court and began firing at the two, killing them on the spot.         
	As the undertrials, both residents of Etah and accused of murder and abduction, lay dead, the policemen escorting the two from Aligarh jail fired back, killing the gunmen.        
	The alert policemen gunned down the three after a brief encounter, PTI quoted superintendent of police J.P. Singh as saying.        
	Singh said investigations were on to establish the identity of the trio.        
	Additional police chief Lal said old rivalry between two criminal gangs could be a reason behind the attack.        
	Sound of gunshots sent people scrambling in panic in Mathura too when some criminals opened fire in the air and fled with an undertrial from a court in the temple city.        
	Police sources told UNI Virendra Singh, accused in a case of attempted murder, escaped from custody as the criminals fired in the air. Constable Rajesh Singh, the lone policeman accompanying the criminal, was hit by pellets, they said.        
	The undertrial was being taken to the court of an additional district judge when the incident took place, the sources added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | UN sole judge of Korea test, says Delhi
                                                                                                               UN sole judge of Korea test, says Delhi
                            
	New Delhi, April 5 (PTI): India today said the UN watchdog IAEA is the appropriate body to decide whether North Korea had violated its obligations to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) even as the US and some other countries condemned its long-range rocket test.         
	External affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee said Indias commitment to non-proliferation was total but it did not intend to sign the NPT as it is discriminatory and in favour of states with nuclear weapons.        
	Our position is very clear. We are totally in agreement that those who are signatories to the NPT must fulfil their treaty obligations, Mukherjee told reporters here.         
	The IAEA is the appropriate watchdog body in this area, he said. The minister asserted that Indias commitment to non-proliferation was total but it was not in favour of signing the NPT.        
	We are second to none in propagating non-proliferation but we did not sign the NPT and we do not have any intention of signing it because we disagree with the objective. We disagree with the gross discrimination which these treaties make between nuclear weapon states and non-nuclear weapon states, Mukherjee said.         
	He said it was because of the discriminatory nature of the NPT that India had not signed the treaty.         
	A defiant North Korea today drew criticism from its neighbours and the US, which believed the launch was a cover for testing Pyongyangs missile technology.        
	Reacting to the launch, US President Barack Obama, who is in Prague, called it a provocative act amounting to a test of Taepodong-2 missile and sought a UN Security Council.        
	Japan and South Korea said the North Korean action was a cover for a long-range ballistic missile test in contravention of a UN resolution.        
	Expressing its regret and disappointment over North Koreas action, the South Korean presidential office said Pyongyang had caused a serious threat to peace on the Korean Peninsula.        
	President Lee Myung-bak instructed the military to bolster its vigilance against emergency situations.

                                                                                                               Rajiv convicts   on fast for freedom
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Chennai, Sept. 21: Two life convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case have begun a fast unto death in Vellore prison demanding they be released as they have completed their mandatory 14 years.         
	Nalini and Robert Payas, who started their fast this morning, want to be released like other convicts freed after seven and 10 years during the year-long celebrations that began last September to mark hundred years of DMK founder C.N. Annadurais birth.        
	What is the justification in keeping me in jail after 18 years and three months when lifers are normally released after 14 years? When concessions have been made for other prisoners, why am I, with a teenaged daughter and two aged in-laws (parents of her husband Murugan who is on death row) to look after, being discriminated against? Nalini, 42, said in a letter sent to the jailer and released through her lawyer.        
	Nalinis death sentence was commuted to life on an appeal by Sonia Gandhi, who said the convict had to bring up her daughter. Two years ago, Priyanka Gandhi had met Nalini during a trip kept under wraps.        
	But Nalinis attempt to walk free has been repeatedly thwarted by the Tamil Nadu government, which claims it has no authority to decide on her release as the CBI had prosecuted her in the case.        
	A prison advisory board had rejected her plea in September last year, saying she might resort to unlawful activities because of her sympathy for the LTTEs cause.         
	Nalini challenged the decision in Madras High Court, which directed the board to examine her case afresh. That hasnt happened yet.        
	While in prison, Nalini completed a masters course in computer applications from Indira Gandhi National Open University.         
	Her husband Murugan, who completed his bachelors degree in the same subject, edits Prison Birds, the jails in-house Tamil magazine.        
	Their 16-year-old daughter Meghara lives in Sri Lanka.

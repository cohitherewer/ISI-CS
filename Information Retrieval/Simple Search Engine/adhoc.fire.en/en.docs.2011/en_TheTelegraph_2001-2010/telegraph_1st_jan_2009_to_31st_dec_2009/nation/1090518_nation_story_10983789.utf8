The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Address gap slows flu fight
                                                                                                               Address gap slows flu fight
          G.S. MUDUR                              
	New Delhi, May 17: Gaps in home addresses have complicated the search for some of the passengers who had arrived in Hyderabad from Dubai earlier this week on an aircraft that had also ferried a 23-year-old Indian infected with the new influenza virus.         
	 The man, currently at an isolation health facility and on anti-viral treatment, has recovered from his fever but state health officials have been looking for 156 other passengers who had shared aircraft cabin space with him on the flight.         
	Health officials have found 144 passengers and are looking for nine persons who appear to have given incomplete addresses in their health verification forms, Subhakar Kandi, a respiratory medicine specialist in Hyderabad, who is co-ordinating the states flu control centre said. Were trying our best to find the other nine and hope to do that by tomorrow, he said.         
	Three passengers who had given addresses in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh are expected to be traced soon by health officials in the two states, he said.         
	No one among the 144 traced has any sign of respiratory infection but we have advised them to stay at home, not mingle with others and keep away from all social gatherings for seven days, Kandi said.         
	The incubation period of the H1N1 virus, which is spreading fast elsewhere in the world, is about seven days. An infected person may shed the virus before symptoms appear.         
	Indian health officials have pencilled a strategy that will seek out to contain the infection if it surfaces at any place in India. The strategy is aimed at preventing domestic spread of the virus.         
	Health surveillance is continuing at all 21 airports that receive international passengers. More than 600,000 people have been screened over the past two weeks.         
	The World Health Organisation reported today that the virus has spread to 39 countries.

                                                                                                               Red bandh starts in Bihar
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, Oct. 12: The Maoist-sponsored bandh today crippled life in most parts of Magadh division and the state and affected movement of vehicles, including that of long-distance trucks and buses on the NH-2 also known as the Grand Trunk Road.         
	The maximum impact was felt on Sherghati sub-division of Gaya and adjoining areas of neighbouring Aurangabad.        
	According to reports reaching the divisional headquarters, the four-lane GT Road resembled a sea of stranded vehicles. Rebel sponsors of the bandh also felled trees at dozens of places across Aurangabad to prevent movement of vehicles. One mobile tower was also blown up in Aurangabad as well.         
	Indian Railways, which has been the worst-hit sector in every Maoist bandh till date, set up a 24-hour emergency control room at Gaya railway station to monitor train movements during the bandh hours and to respond to crisis.         
	The control room was set up in the chamber of the station manager.         
	Confirming the establishment of the control room, area manager S. Bhattacharya said that a three-coach patrol special train with a ready-to-move diesel engine has been kept ready to move at a moments notice. The patrol train will also run between Paharpur and Rafiganj stations of the Dhanbad and Mughalsarai divisions of the railways.        
	SAP jawans, GRP personnel and district policemen have been deployed in the patrol special train. As a precautionary measure, a bunch of mail express trains were also ready to run today.         
	Jodhpur Express, Dehra Dun Express, Neelanchal Express and Kalka Mail were slated to run in the vulnerable areas. These trains were preceded by a goods train.         
	Tight security was arranged for the safe run of Rajdhani Express during the bandh period, Bhattacharya added. Magadh director general of police Anupama Nilekar said that the bandh remained peaceful on its first day.

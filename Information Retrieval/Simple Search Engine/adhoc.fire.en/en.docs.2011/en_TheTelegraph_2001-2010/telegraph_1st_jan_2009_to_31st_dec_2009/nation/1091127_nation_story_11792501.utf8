The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rajnath blip on LS screen
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Rajnath blip on LS screen
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                            Sushma, Rajnath: Babri test                          
	New Delhi, Nov. 26: BJP president Rajnath Singh has displaced Sushma Swaraj as the opening speaker when the Lok Sabha debates the Liberhan commissions report on December 1.        
	Although Sushma said protocol and propriety demanded Rajnath do the honours, the change has become a talking point within the BJP, given the speculation on who will replace L.K. Advani as leader of the Opposition if and when he demits office.        
	On November 25, when the Lok Sabha office notified the date of the discussion, Advani had informed Sushma and Arun Jaitley, leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, that since they would initiate the debate, they should start preparing their speeches.         
	Today, Sushma told journalists that Rajnath would open the discussion and she would be one of two other speakers.        
	Two or three days ago, Rajnathji told me he would like to participate in a discussion that was already scheduled. I told him he might like to speak on sugarcane growers problems if and when the government brought in an amended bill on sugar pricing policy.        
	Today, when I told him the sugarcane bill was not yet listed on Parliaments agenda, he said give me a subject for which a date has been fixed because I will be in and out of Jharkhand. I suggested the Liberhan debate and he promptly agreed, Sushma said. He agreed....         
	Rajnaths account differed slightly. I wasnt keen on the sugarcane debate because the matter has been resolved and there is little to say, he told The Telegraph. This morning, our leaders, Advaniji, Sushmaji and others, decided I would open the Liberhan debate. Sushmaji conveyed the decision to me.        
	The episode has been interpreted by some to mean that Sushmas succession as leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha was not as settled as it appeared. Although Advani is keen she steps into his shoes when he quits, some feel the RSS might pitch for Rajnath.

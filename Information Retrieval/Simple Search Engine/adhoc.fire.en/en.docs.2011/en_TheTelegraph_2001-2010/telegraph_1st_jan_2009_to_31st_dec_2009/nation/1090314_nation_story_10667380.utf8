The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Aam aadmi back, with Jai ho
                                                                                                               Aam aadmi back, with Jai ho
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 13: The aam aadmi of 2004 returns as the centrepiece of the Congresss campaign slogan, but in a new avatar.        
	In the last Lok Sabha elections, the slogan had said: Congress ka haath, aam aadmi ke saath (the Congresss hand is with the common man). The message was a benign Congress alone could save the aam aadmi from the BJPs insidious agenda, conveyed by the India Shining theme.        
	Five years down the UPA rule, the aam aadmi has moved ahead with a confident India. The new slogan is: Aam aadmi ke badhte kadam, har kadam pe Bharat buland (The common man is marching ahead, every step of his makes India stronger).        
	The slogan, which does not roll off the tongue too easily, has acquired a life of its own thanks to A.R. Rahman. His Oscar-winning Jai ho is the background score for the Congress commercial that advertises the governments achievements and projects its leaders, past and present.        
	Except for one omission. P.V. Narasimha Rao has been blacked out of the galaxy of Prime Ministers that finds a place for Lal Bahadur Shastri alongside Jawaharlal Nehru and the Gandhis.        
	Manmohan has got almost as much footage as Sonia Gandhi in the commercial, replete with the stock-in-trade of official ads: smiling peasants, chubby babies, scrubbed schoolkids, well-equipped schools and hospitals, smooth roads, verdant fields, nuclear power plants and the moon mission.

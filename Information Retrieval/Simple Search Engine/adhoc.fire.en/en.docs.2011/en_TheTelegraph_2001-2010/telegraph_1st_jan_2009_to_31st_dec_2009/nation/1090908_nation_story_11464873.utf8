The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | National awards? Ks cant complain
                                                                                                               National awards? Ks cant complain
          PRATIM D. GUPTA                            Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan                                 
	Calcutta, Sept. 7: The government has extended its please-all policy from politics to entertainment.         
	The 55th National Awards for Films, for movies released in 2007, were announced today. Just a cursory glance at the list will tell you how they have managed to please the two big Khans  Shah Rukh and Aamir  without going big on Bollywood.        
	The Best Film has gone to Priyadarshans Tamil film Kanchivaram. The jury headed by filmmaker Sai Paranjpye has awarded SRK-starrer Chak De! India the Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment and Aamirs directorial debut Taare Zameen Par the Best Film on Family Welfare.        
	After awarding the Best Actor trophy to Saif Ali Khan for Hum Tum and Amitabh Bachchan for Black in back- to-back editions for 2004 and 2005, there was considerable speculation within the film industry as to which Khan would be given the Rajat Kamal for 2007.         
	Shah Rukhs turn as hockey coach Kabir Khan in Chak De and Aamirs Ram Shankar Nikumbh act in Taare Zameen Par were pitted against each other in yet another Khan-versus-Khan contest.        
	But the National Film Awards jury has gone for Prakash Raj for Kanchivaram, making the point that they are looking beyond Bollywood superstars for the acting trophies. The Best Actress has gone to Umashree for Girish Kasaravallis Kannada film Gulabi Talkies while Kareena Kapoor has swept all the popular awards of the year for her performance in Jab We Met.        
	Aamir and SRK, who fought a war of words in print before shaking hands for the producers fight against plexes a couple of months ago, shouldnt be too unhappy. While Taare Zameen Par has sure won a couple of more awards  Best Male Playback Singer (Shankar Mahadevan) and Best Lyricist (Prasoon Joshi)  both films being given one of the major awards and the Best Actor not going to either of the Khans would mean they are on level-playing ground.         
	And keeping the two happy seems to be the intention of the National Film Awards jury.        
	Multiple reasons, including controversies over the choice of winners, have resulted in the National Awards lagging behind by a year.         
	The Directorate of Film Festivals of the information and broadcasting ministry, which conducts the awards, plans to clear the backlog by giving out the awards for 2008 by the end of this year.

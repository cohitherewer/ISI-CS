The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Excellent with US, not so with the rest
                                                                                                               Excellent with US, not so with the rest
										        VALUE  JUDGEMENT          Foreign Policy      K.P. NAYAR                              
	Washington, March 15: If India and the US were the only two countries on planet Earth, the United Progressive Alliance government would get 10 out of 10 for its foreign policy as it heads to the polls for a mandate to return to power.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs unifocal attention to making India a partner of the US during his nearly five years in office has been a singular success of the UPA government, but it has not been matched by a similar enhancement of Indias profile, stakes or prestige elsewhere on the globe.        
	The Indo-US nuclear deal, which had a tortuous journey from its conception in 2005 to its operationalisation last year, will go down in the history of Indian diplomacy as a landmark achievement of this government.        
	Says T.P. Sreenivasan, a member of the Prime Ministers National Security Advisory Board (NSAB) and chairman of an NSAB sub-committee on nuclear issues: Contrary to the general impression, the Indo-US nuclear deal is not just about adding a few megawatts of electricity to the Indian grid. It is about a transformation in the entire non-proliferation architecture imposed on the world by the nuclear weapons states.        
	As the deputy chief of mission at the Indian embassy in Washington, Sreenivasan bore the brunt of a vicious, no-holds-barred campaign by American non-proliferationists against Indias nuclear tests in 1998.        
	And after Washington, as Indias governor to the International Atomic Energy Agency for three years, he had to counter institutionalised attempts to make a pariah of India for its principled refusal to surrender to nuclear apartheid.        
	Indias place in the new dispensation is important for our long-time goals in the international arena, Sreenivasan says about the long-term implications of the nuclear deal with the US.        
	The significance of our new status is that India is today a partner and not a target of the global nuclear community.    
	Although the nuclear deal has become emblematic of the UPA governments deepened relations with Washington, Indo-US relations are not made up of this one-item bilateral agenda.        
	Manmohan Singhs legacy is that there are now 28 different dialogue processes under way with the US. These range from agriculture and energy to high technology and environment.        
	Former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger, the doyen of diplomats in our time, said this month at the golden jubilee celebrations of the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies that today there is no more important strategic relationship for the US between Singapore and Cairo than India.        
	The other side of this thriving relationship with the US, however, is that it has been achieved at a great cost to Indian diplomacy, which will need a huge element of course correction to regain its balance in the years to come.        
	M.K. Bhadrakumar was the architect of P.V. Narasimha Raos policy in the early 1990s of weaning Iran away from its decades-old alliance with Pakistan, which met its crowning success when Irans then President, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, unequivocally praised Indian secularism during a visit to Lucknow, sending shock waves through Pakistan and much of the Islamic world.        
	Bhadrakumar says: The UPAs tenure is a depressing chronicle of wasted time in Indias overall adjustment to a rapidly evolving international system. The facile assumptions underlying the strategic partnership with the US have been blown to smithereens and a lot of debris is ensuing, such as the shattered ties with Iran, the atrophied friendship with Russia, or the annoyance of China as India gravitated for incomprehensible reasons to the hare-brained idea of a quadrilateral Asian alliance against it.        
	A veteran of Indias neighbourhood diplomacy, who served in Islamabad, Kabul and Colombo and handled Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan in South Block during some of the most tempestuous years of India-Pakistan brinkmanship, Bhadrakumar credibly argues that the propensity to subcontract the Pakistan problem to the US stands badly exposed after the November 2008 Mumbai attacks. We have lost influence in Nepal and profound question marks arise over the future course of Sri Lankan policies in the Indian Ocean region once Colombo sorts out the Tamil Tigers  ironically with Indian help. All this adds up to a substantial crisis in foreign policy.        
	When Manmohan Singh walked into his South Block office on the afternoon of May 22, 2004, after being sworn in to head the UPA government, the first question he asked was: Where is Brajeshji?        
	Brajesh Mishra, the national security adviser to Atal Bihari Vajpayee, had resigned, cleared his office and left two hours before Singhs arrival in South Block. The new Prime Minister immediately requested Vajpayee to make Mishra available for a briefing at Singhs residence the following morning.        
	It is unlikely that the next Prime Minister  even if he is someone from the UPA other than Singh  will want to be briefed by M.K. Narayanan, the present national security adviser. It is highly probable that if Singh returns to office, he may just be waiting to see the back of Narayanan.        
	The landmark contribution by Narayanan to the UPA governments foreign and security policies has been the virtual destruction of the inter-agency process within the administration. Almost single-handedly, Narayanan made RAW, Indias external spy agency, a ghost of what it once was by his complicity in choosing someone to head RAW who was acknowledged on paper as being unfit to lead the agency.        
	Narayanan then stood by and watched as morale in the agency reached its nadir, capable agents resigned, key officials defected abroad while some others were compromised in key stations and had to be withdrawn post-haste back to New Delhi.  
	Relations between RAW and the ministry of external affairs, which make up an artery of effective diplomacy, have oscillated between the non-existent to being at its worst during the UPA governments tenure.        
	History will judge what role all this played in the recent terrorist attacks against India, including the Mumbai carnage in November and the assassination of Indian diplomatic and military personnel at its embassy in Kabul last July. P. Chidambaram has decisively taken matters into his hands after moving to the home ministry, but his actions have come too late for a hapless country.        
	The last Congress government headed by Rao, in which Singh was finance minister, put in place a radically new foreign policy for India, focusing for the first time on what was effective rather than what was wrong with the world.        
	Rao and Singh together evolved robust and realistic policies that used diplomacy to advance Indias needs.        
	The worlds best-known international civil servant of Indian origin, Shashi Tharoor, a former undersecretary-general of the UN, says the Manmohan Singh government has effectively and subtly recalibrated this policy.        
	Tharoor says: We have become more focused on a foreign policy that can directly benefit the Indian people rather than remaining attached to ideological positions.

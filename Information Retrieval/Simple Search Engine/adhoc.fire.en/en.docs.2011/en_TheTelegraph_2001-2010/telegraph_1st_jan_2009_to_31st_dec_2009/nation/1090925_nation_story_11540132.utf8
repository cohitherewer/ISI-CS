The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cricket war cost: ODI with Aussies
                                                                                                               Cricket war cost: ODI with Aussies
          OUR BUREAU                          Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia arrives at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai to attend the BCCI annual general meeting on Thursday. (PTI)                                  
	Sept. 24: The cricket turf war in Rajasthan has cost Jaipur a one-day international with Australia  a demand raised by the camp loyal to the games czar Lalit Modi.        
	The Indian cricket board (BCCI) shifted the match, scheduled for October 25 at Sawai Man Singh Stadium, to Vadodara, after giving a brief audience to the two warring factions of the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA).         
	Looking at the RCA dispute, it has been decided to shift the Australia ODI from Jaipur to Baroda (Vadodara), BCCI president Shashank Manohar said after the boards annual general meeting in Mumbai today.         
	The feud burst into the open on Sunday when the faction headed by Subhash Joshi, a former RCA secretary, and Bimal Soni, chief of the Jaipur Cricket Association, declared that Sanjay Dixit had been ousted as president after a no-confidence motion passed against him at an AGM.         
	Claiming the support of 20 of the states 33 district cricket associations, the Modi loyalists called for RCA elections on October 14.        
	Dixit countered by saying he had cancelled the AGM and the no-confidence motion was, therefore, null and void. His rivals argued that an AGM once announced could not be cancelled.         
	The ruling regime barricaded the RCA offices on Tuesday, prompting the rival camp to lock the gates. Both factions wanted their members to represent Rajasthan at the BCCI meeting today.         
	In what is being seen as a setback for the ruling camp, the board permitted Dixit as well as Rajendra Singh Rathore, appointed acting officiating president by the challengers, to attend todays AGM. Both were allowed to sign the minutes register.        
	The RCAs is a complicated issue and needs a judicial order, explained Manohar. So we allowed both representatives to attend the meeting with the provision that whenever a matter required voting, the two votes would be kept in a secret ballot box and would be opened only after the (RCA) matter was settled. Fortunately, there were no issues where voting was necessary.         
	Sources said the rival camp met Manohar and told him that since the RCA was headless, it would not be able to hold an ODI at Jaipur.         
	Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, concerned over the fate of the match, had called up Union minister Sharad Pawar, a former BCCI president whose loyalists are now in charge of the board, urging him not to take the match away from Jaipur.        
	Speaking to reporters after the BCCI meet, Dixit accused Modi, whom he had defeated as RCA president on March 1, of attempting to destabilise the association. He (Modi) is behind all this. He is an outsider and has no interest in Rajasthan cricket he is trying to destabilise the association, Dixit said.         
	Dixit, an IAS officer, alleged that there was a CD which showed money being offered by Modi to bribe members.         
	Modi, a BCCI vice-president who is also chairman of the cash-rich Indian Premier League, brushed aside Dixits allegations. I have no idea about these things. I am not a candidate (for the RCA presidents post). I am happy where I am, he said.         
	Asked for a direct response on the accusations, Modi said: What allegations? He (Dixit) is a non-entity there are always allegations and counter-allegations  I am just doing my job and you know my job.         
	Mahmud Abdi, a staunch supporter of Modi, said their camp had been given legitimacy by the BCCI which has appointed one of its members, Mahendra Nahar, as the central zone representative on the junior cricket committee.

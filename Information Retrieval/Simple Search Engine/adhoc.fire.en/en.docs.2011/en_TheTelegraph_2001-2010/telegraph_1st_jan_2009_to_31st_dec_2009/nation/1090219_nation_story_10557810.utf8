The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | JD(U) to claim 5 seats in state
                                                                                                               JD(U) to claim 5 seats in state

	Patna, Feb. 18: Nitish Kumar-led JD(U) is keen to capture Kishenganj and Bhagalpur seats from the BJP in the seat-sharing ratio and negotiations are on between the two NDA partners in Bihar.         
	Though not many among the involved parties are ready to discuss the negotiation, senior sources in the JD(U) revealed that the party strategists were trying to persuade the BJP to spare the two Muslim-dominated seats.         
	During their negotiations JD(U) leaders have argued that Muslim voters would prefer the JD(U), especially since the party has pushed several measures for the community. The JD(U) has quoted examples of the 1989 Bhagalpur riots verdict, life-long pension for riot victims and fencing of Muslim graveyards, besides adequate representation of community members in its cadre, as just some of the steps taken.         
	On the other hand, the JD(U) negotiators have argued, the community is wary of the BJP, more so after chief Rajnath Singh declared that the party would get the Ram temple built at Aodhya  a stand from which Nitish Kumar has hastily disassociated himself and his outfit.         
	JD(U)s national general secretary and MP Shivanand Tiwary told The Telegraph over phone: We should not confine negotiations to individual interests of BJP and JD(U). Rather, we should ensure maximum seats for the NDA from Bihar. That will pave the path for Advani to becoming the next Prime Minister. Tiwarys politically correct remarks are pregnant with JD(U)s desire to bargain for more seats in the partys share this time around.         
	The JD(U) had contested on 24 seats against BJPs 16 in the 2004 poll. Apart from Bhagalpur and Kishenganj, the JD(U) is also persuading its ally to spare Chapra, Motihari and Nawada.        
	The party has pushed two reasons for claiming the seats  the JD(U) top rung believes that BJPs Rajiv Pratap Rudi, who belongs to Chapra, is too weak a candidate against Lalu Prasad. We are ready to spare seats for the BJP, if the latter identifies some and can prove that their party is in a better state there than us, said a senior leader.         
	On the other hand, the BJP has been staking its claim on Muzaffarpur Lok Sabha seat  which George Fernandes represents in the Lok Sabha. Muzaffarpur has been in BJPs share prior to 2004. We spared it (the seat) in Georges honour. But, now we should get the seat back, since its clear that the JD(U) would not field Fernandes this time on health grounds, said a senior BJP leader.         
	Sources revealed that the BJP general secretary and Bihar in-charge, Arun Jaitley, is likely to arrive in Bihar soon to meet Nitish Kumar in a bid to finally settle the issue.

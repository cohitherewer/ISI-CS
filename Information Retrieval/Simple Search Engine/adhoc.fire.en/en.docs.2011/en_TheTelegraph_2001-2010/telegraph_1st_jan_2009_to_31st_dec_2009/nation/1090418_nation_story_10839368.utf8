The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lanka lash to pre-empt ADMK
                                                                                                               Lanka lash to pre-empt ADMK
          OUR BUREAU                              
	April 17: Pranab Mukherjee today played the good cop and M. Karunanidhi the bad cop on Sri Lanka as the UPA sought to deny the Opposition a chance to tap an emotive issue in Tamil Nadu which could have a decisive say in who forms the next government at the Centre.        
	Tamil Nadu chief minister Karunanidhi went as far as to suggest that the Centre snap diplomatic relations with Sri Lanka if it continued to ignore Indias demand to extend the ceasefire with the Tigers.         
	A few hours earlier, foreign minister Mukherjee had said in Calcutta that the ceasefire should be extended.        
	Mukherjee said the continuation of precipitate military action leading to further civilian casualties would be totally unacceptable.         
	We had welcomed Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksas announcement of a cessation of hostilities for the Tamil and Sinhala New Year over the last two days. The government of Sri Lanka must extend this pause in hostilities to prevent casualties.         
	The minister stressed the Indian governments concern for the security of the Tamil civilians and its efforts to ensure their safe passage to secure zones.        
	Karunanidhi reacted with alacrity. In telegrams sent to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and Mukherjee, he said: We welcome with gratitude the appeal by the minister of external affairs for a ceasefire in Sri Lanka. If the appeal for ceasefire is not honoured and implemented by the Sri Lankan government, we request the government of India to snap all diplomatic relations with Sri Lanka.         
	Aides took care to point out that Karunanidhi had sent the telegram as DMK president, not chief minister.         
	The statement is being seen as an attempt to pre-empt the Jayalalithaa-led ADMK which is planning to draw attention to the alleged failure to protect the Lankan Tamils. The issue is expected to figure in campaigning as it picks up momentum in the state which votes on May 13.        
	The DMK leader does not want the Opposition to derive electoral advantage from the unfolding situation in Lanka, though the issue has yet to emerge as a game-changer in the state.

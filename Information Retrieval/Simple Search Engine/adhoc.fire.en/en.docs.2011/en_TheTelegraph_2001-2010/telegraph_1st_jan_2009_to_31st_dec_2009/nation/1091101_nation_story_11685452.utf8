	Calcutta, Oct. 31: Three engineering students from Bengal were washed away by a tide in Puri on Saturday afternoon. Two students aged 21 and 23 were confirmed dead.        
	A fourth student, from Jadavpur, has been admitted to hospital in a critical condition.        
	The three students, two from Burdwan and one from West Midnapore, were part of a 102-member group from the Kalyani Government Engineering College. They had gone to Puri on an annual education tour.        
	The bodies of Sayan Barui (21) and Ranjit Singh (23) have been found. A search is on for Arindam Haldar (23).        
	The students were taking abath in the sea when the tide swept them away. The full moon, when tides swell, is two days away.        
	Three others who were with them were injured and are undergoing treatment in hospital.        
	The three who managed to swim to safety have been identified as Anirban Sengupta, Suvadip Sanpui and Mukesh Singh, said Chanchal Basu, a relative of Sayan.        
	The conditions of Suvadip from Jadavapur and Mukesh from Burdwan Town are said to be critical. Anirban was discharged from hospital tonight.        
	Arindam is a second-year student. Sayan too was in the second year while Ranjit was a third-year student. Sayan and Ranjit lived in Durgapally in Kalna and Purbasthali of Burdwan while Arindam is a resident of Kharagpur.         
	The college is sending a team of officials to Puri on Sunday. The students, along with two of our officials, left on Thursday and reached Puri yesterday. We had warned the students not to go too deep into the sea while taking bath, an official said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 20: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik has sought a Rs 4,550 crore special central assistance for the integrated development of KBK region (undivided Koraput-Bolangir-Kalahandi districts), a poverty zone.        
	Naveen put forth the demand during a meeting with deputy chairman of Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia in New Delhi yesterday.        
	The state has submitted an eight-year perspective plan for the region to be implemented during 2009-17.         
	After returning from New Delhi today, Naveen told reporters here that he had asked for the assistance as a 100 per cent grant. Ahluwalia had promised to consider the demand, he said.         
	Pleading for more central funds for the implementation of various developmental programmes and continuance of revised long term action plan for sustaining and inducing further development, Naveen claimed his government has utilised 99.81 per cent of the special central assistance of Rs 1,704 crore received during 1998-2009 under the action plan for the KBK region.        
	Official sources here said Naveen had also informed Ahluwalia about the status of implementation of Vijaywada-Ranchi highway project and sought allocation of Rs 300 crore special central assistance during the current year to ensure timely completion of the project.         
	Justifying his demand of funds for his pet project, Naveen said that the highway project, which would pass through 12 tribal dominated districts of Orissa, would help in the development of the region and in tackling growing Maoist menace. Naveen also met Union textile minister Dayanidhi Maran and demanded establishment of National Institute Fashion Technology at Bhubaneswar, for which the state has already promised necessary infrastructure, including land.        
	Maran welcomed the proposal and assured that NIFT would start functioning in Bhubaneswar at a temporary location within three moths and offer a few certificate courses, while regular classes would commence from the next academic year, Naveen told reporters here today.         
	The chief minister also requested the Maran to set up a knitwear park near Bhubaneswar under the Scheme for Integrated Textile Park for which the state has already allocated 35 acres. Naveen also urged establishment of an office of Export Promotion Council for Handicraft at Bhubaneswar for increasing export of handloom products from Orissa.

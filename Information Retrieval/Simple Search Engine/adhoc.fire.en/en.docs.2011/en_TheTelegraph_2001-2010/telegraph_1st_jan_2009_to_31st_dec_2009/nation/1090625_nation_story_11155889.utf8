          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bhardwaj                                  
	New Delhi, June 24: H.R. Bhardwaj, who failed to retain his job as law minister, has been offered the shelter of a Raj Bhavan but not the one he was keen on.        
	Bhardwaj was today named the governor of Karnataka in the first round of Raj Bhavan changes announced by the new UPA government. President Pratibha Patil has appointed governors in Bihar and Madhya Pradesh, too.        
	Bhardwaj is learnt to have been eager to make it to the Raj Bhavan in Mumbai in place of S.C. Jamir after the former law minister was passed over when the cabinet list was drawn up.        
	Bhardwaj has fallen so much out of favour with 10 Janpath that not only was he excluded from the cabinet but also could not get the state he wanted for the governor assignment. In Karnataka, Bhardwaj will replace Rameshwar Thakur who has been transferred by the President to Madhya Pradesh to succeed Balram Jakhar.        
	Arjun Singh, who was denied the human resource ministry this time, did not figure on the list of governors announced today. Bihars new governor is a senior Congressman from Assam, former state power minister Devanand Konwar. Konwar will replace R.L. Bhatia.        
	The Centre will have to decide on a string of governors through the year. Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana and Maharashtra are due for new governors next month while Goas turn comes up in August. Punjab will need a replacement in November, followed by Bengal and Rajasthan in December.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | NCP deal upsets Cong risk-takers
                                                                                                               NCP deal upsets Cong risk-takers
          SANJAY K. JHA                          Rahul Gandhi                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 23: A powerful section of the Congress leadership, including Rahul Gandhi, is upset about the electoral deal struck with the NCP.        
	While this section did not favour any pre-poll alliance at all, it believes even the seat-sharing formula did not protect the Congresss interests.        
	Top sources in the Congress revealed that the alliance was sealed despite Rahuls reservations. It is a battle between those who prefer status quo and those who take risks for better goals. It is a battle between those who want to be safe and those who want to fight for the partys growth. The status-quoists have won this time, a source said, contending that the deal would help only the NCP which was facing an uphill task.        
	Rahuls wish was ignored not just on the question of alliance. The majority of candidates recommended by him from the Youth Congress, both in Maharashtra and Haryana, were not picked. The sources said only three to four out of around 15 candidates suggested by Rahul got tickets.        
	 In many cases, the party either did not want to antagonise the well-entrenched forces or doubted the winnability of the candidate.        
	Rahul, however, is not as much concerned about the choice of candidates as the surrender to the NCP, the sources said. A powerful AICC general secretary close to Rahul asserted that the Congress had lost an ideal opportunity to reclaim its original space in Maharashtra.        
	The general secretary said a large section of the NCP was ready to cross over to the Congress, and a strong psychological push at this critical stage would have rattled Sharad Pawar. Breaking the alliance would have created that psychological push, he said.        
	This section is convinced that a post-poll alliance was the best option. Rahul, along with former chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh and many senior leaders in the high command, were supportive of this plan.        
	But others, such as chief minister Ashok Chavan, Sushil Kumar Shinde and Maharashtra in-charge A.K. Antony, convinced Sonia Gandhi that the gamble could be fatal, resulting in transfer of power to the Sena-BJP combine. This group felt there was no cushion to take the risk in the face of a decade-long anti-incumbency and the narrow difference in vote percentage.        
	The go-it-alone sections anger was reflected in a senior Congress leaders response to a question about the partys prospects. He said: Dont ask me. I had an assessment in case we went alone. Now at least 20-25 of our strong candidates will either join the Sena-BJP or contest as Independents. People are angry with the NCP, not the Congress. We have given a fresh lease of life to the NCP at our cost. We could have crossed 110 on our own but now I dont know what will happen. The Assembly has 288 seats.        
	The Congress released a list of 159 candidates for Maharashtra today and the only famous relative who got the ticket is President Pratibha Patils son Rajendra Shekhawat. All other children of senior leaders were ignored. But 15 seats are still pending and there is room to accommodate Vilasraos son Amit and Shindes daughter Praniti if the leadership wants to do so.        
	Shindes son-in-law has been ignored as his constituency, the upscale Malabar Hills in Mumbai, has gone to someone else.         
	Sons and daughters of other leaders, including Narayan Rane, have been denied ticket. One relative of a stalwart is Rohit Deepak from Kasba Peth. He is a seventh-generation kin of Bal Gangadhar Tilak.        
	All those who crossed over from the Shiv Sena have been accommodated, along with the Independents who had supported the government for the past five years.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Aug. 29: Sanjita, who has been claiming to be the biological daughter of BJD MLA Arabinda Dhali, has now moved Orissa High Court for a DNA test to prove her case, adding to the former ministers worries.        
	Fourteen days after the State Commission for Women ordered for a DNA test to determine her father, Sanjita has filed a writ petition seeking judicial intervention against police inaction.        
	The commission had on August 13 asked the police commissioner to conduct the test. The next day, Dhali had refused to undergo a DNA test. Later, his wife Manju filed a defamation case on August 17 seeking Rs 5 crore damages from Sanjita, first wife Kamala Baral, acting SCW chairperson Usha Padhee and three others.        
	Dhali had denied that Sanjita was his daughter but admitted that Kamala, her mother, was his first wife, who said: Only a DNA test can reveal the truth.                                
	Sanjita, in her petition, has sought the high courts direction for the DNA test, while urging formation of a board for drawing blood samples in the presence of a magistrate and getting it tested at an accredited laboratory. The court should further issue directions to prevent any second draw of blood samples, the petition filed yesterday has prayed.        
	Sanjita has also filed a miscellaneous case in the high court seeking maintenance from Dhali.        
	The heat has been mounting on Bhubaneswar (Jayadev) MLA since cases were registered against him at the Mahila police station in the state capital on the basis of a complaint lodged on July 25 by the 23-year-old woman claiming to be his daughter.        
	Cases under Sections 10 and 11 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, had also been booked against Dhali upon her complaint that he married her off when she was a minor and his second wife and his brother-in-law tortured her physically at their house.        
	Yesterday, Bhubaneswar-Cuttack police commissioner B.K. Sharma constituted a three-member team to probe the allegations made by Sanjita.

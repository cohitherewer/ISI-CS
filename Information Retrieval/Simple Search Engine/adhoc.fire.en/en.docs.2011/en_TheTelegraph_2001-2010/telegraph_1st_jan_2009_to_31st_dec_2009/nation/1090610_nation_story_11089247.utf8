The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Race in Cong for ministry and gratuity
                                                                                                               Race in Cong for ministry and gratuity
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, June 9: As word spread that the Prime Minister was shortlisting names for 14 vacancies in Raj Bhavans across the country, out-of-work Congress leaders have started jousting for a job that is seen as gratuity for a lifetime spent serving the Grand Old Party.        
	A race is also on for the water resources ministers post, which fell vacant when Meira Kumar was elected Speaker.        
	Orissa MP Srikanta Jena, who had hoped to get cabinet rank and the water portfolio, has been told to take charge as minister of state for chemicals and fertilisers and will do so tomorrow, sources said. Jena had refrained from taking office all these days because he wanted cabinet rank.         
	I have full confidence in the leadership, he said today after meeting the Prime Minister and Sonia Gandhi.         
	Senior Orissa MPs Hemanand Biswal and Bhakta Charan Das had made clear they were against Jenas elevation . They asked why they were passed over in the first place and why Jena, who migrated from the Janata Dal a few years ago, was made a minister.        
	Sources said the complaint was valid because Biswal was a former chief minister and Das a former Union minister. Biswal is also a tribal and the Congress leadership is wary of annoying this important group in Orissa.        
	In considering other names for the water resources ministry, the Congress is looking for an MP from a state not involved in a water dispute with another state.         
	This rules out Pawan Kumar Bansal, the parliamentary affairs minister who had sought an additional portfolio. Chandigarh, which Bansal represents in Parliament, is a neutral constituency but is also the capital of Haryana and Punjab, which are fighting over water from the Yamuna and the Ravi-Beas rivers.        
	A process of elimination arrived at the name of former water resources minister Saifuddin Soz, a Rajya Sabha MP from Jammu and Kashmir. Jammu and Kashmir has a water dispute with Pakistan, but none with any other Indian state. However, the small state already has two cabinet ministers  Ghulam Nabi Azad and Farooq Abdullah  and there were questions on whether Soz could make it on the principle of regional parity.        
	The Uttar Pradesh and Bihar units are clamouring for a berth, complaining about under-representation in the first round and zero representation in the second.         
	Meira was Bihars sole nominee in the cabinet. The Congress has only one other MP from Bihar, Mohammad Asrarul Haque of Kishanganj. The theologist and writer, who defeated RJD veteran Mohammad Taslimuddin, had filed his nomination on the last day.        
	Uttar Pradesh has no cabinet minister, only ministers of state. However, it has Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi.         
	While there is only one ministry up for grabs now, there already are two vacancies for Governor  in Tripura and Puducherry  and there will be 12 more by the end of the year. The leadership is looking at them all together, rather than fill the vacancies in a piecemeal fashion.        
	Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh are trying to work out whom to send to the sensitive states of Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra. Sources said though the leaders were inclined towards honourable settlements for pensioners like Shivraj Patil, Arjun Singh and H.R. Bharadwaj, Arjun and Bharadwaj didnt want to be banished from active politics. The other problem is the three are serving Rajya Sabha MPs and the Congress doesnt want to upset the balance in the Upper House.        
	But at the same time, the party has conveyed to the Prime Minister that politicians should be chosen over former bureaucrats and police officials. Margaret Alva and Motilal Vora are other seniors in the race.         
	The Raj Bhavan in Bengal will fall vacant in December.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Universities lose cover
                                                                                                               Universities lose cover
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, April 7: Deemed universities are public authorities covered by the Right to Information Act, the laws top referee has decided in a landmark order that rips apart a veil of opacity that presently covers these fast mushrooming institutions.         
	The countrys transparency law covers privately managed, unaided deemed universities and are required to provide information sought under the RTI Act, the Central Information Commission (CIC) has ordered.         
	The CIC, in its order, has argued that deemed universities are public authorities covered by the transparency law since their status is notified by the UGC, the government regulator of higher education.         
	In the order dated March 31, 2009, the CIC has rejected exemption sought by the Narsi Monjee Institute of Management Sciences, a popular private deemed university that is unaided by the government. A copy of the order is with The Telegraph.         
	The CIC, by its order, has overruled an earlier order by the Rajasthan state information commission granting unaided deemed universities exemption from the RTI Act.         
	The order means deemed universities now have to reveal all information related to their funding, admissions, fees, and details pertaining to their management just as government educational institutions are required to under the RTI Act.         
	India has 124 deemed-to-be universities at present. Their status, notified by the UGC, suggests they are institutions that according to the UGCs assessment are capable of reaching standards required for full-fledged universities in India.         
	Some top government institutions of higher learning are among the 124 deemed universities, such as the National Institutes of Technologies, the Indian Institute of Science and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.         
	But most deemed universities are run privately.         
	These include institutions such as the Symbiosis group, the Narsi Monjee Institute of Management Studies (NMIMS), the Bharatiya Vidyapeeth, the Vellore Institute of Technology and the Birla Institute of Technology, Pilani.         
	Traditionally, the best higher educational institutions in India have been government-funded and private institutions aiming to compete for top students with public-run institutions generally seek deemed university status.         
	The status allows them to claim that the UGC accepts them as quality institutions, while at the same time retaining complete autonomy from government rules.         
	Not any more.         
	The CIC in its order has argued that public funding is not required for an institution to be covered by the RTI Act.

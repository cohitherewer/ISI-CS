                                                                                                               Teen murdered, friend arrested
                            
	Mumbai, Feb. 17 (PTI): A Class XII student of a Mumbai college was murdered and his body dumped in a gutter, allegedly by two friends who have been arrested.        
	Mukim Khan, 17, a student of Rizvi College in Bandra, went missing on Friday.         
	Last evening, his friend and college mate Amir Siddiqui Shaikh led police to a drain among the mangroves in Kalina, 15km from the college, where Mukims decomposed body was found, sources said. Amir has confessed to the murder, the sources added.        
	We have arrested Amir Siddiqui Shaikh, who is responsible for the murder of Mukim Khan. Sarfaraz, who also studies in the same college, was arrested in the evening, deputy commissioner of police (zone VIII) Nisar Tamboli said.         
	Both boys were friends of Mukim.        
	Mukims father Akbar Khan today demanded death for his sons killers.        
	The family had received a ransom call demanding Rs 2 lakh on Friday, hours after Mukim left home in the morning, Tamboli said. Initially, the family thought it was a prank as the call was made from (Mukim) Khans phone, the officer added.        
	Later, realising it was not, the family lodged a complaint with the Khar police station, Tamboli said.         
	S.G.A. Zaidi, the principal of Rizvi college, said money appeared to be the motive for the murder and said he was disturbed.        
	They killed Mukim for money. They demanded Rs 2 lakh. We are investigating why they need this money and their exact role in the crime, Tamboli said.         
	Our team has questioned many of Khans friends, including Amir. Last night, his body was found in a decomposed condition in a gutter in Kalina, he added.        
	The crime was a throwback to the murder of another teenager, Adnan Patrawala, in August 2007. Adnan, 16, was murdered by three youths he had made friends with on the social networking site Orkut.         
	Sujith Nair, 28, Ayush Bhat, 19, and Khimmesh Ambavat, 18, had demanded a ransom of Rs 2 crore from Adnans family. They allegedly confessed to panicking and killing him after news of the abduction was aired on television. Adnans body was found in the marshes of Navi Mumbai.

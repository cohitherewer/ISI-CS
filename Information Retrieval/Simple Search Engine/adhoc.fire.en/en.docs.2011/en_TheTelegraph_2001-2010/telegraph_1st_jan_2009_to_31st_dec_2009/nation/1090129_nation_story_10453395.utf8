                                                                                                               India help for Lanka 
                            
	New Delhi, Jan. 28: India and Sri Lanka will join hands to rebuild the war-ravaged northern part of the island nation, foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee said today, reports our special correspondent.        
	We will be working together on a reconstruction plan for these areas, which will involve infrastructure and other support. I was happy to be informed of the progress towards the establishment of a 500MW thermal power project near Trincomalee by NTPC from India, he told reporters after his return from Colombo.              
	During talks with Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse last night, Mukherjee said he had stressed that military victories offered a political opportunity to restore life to normalcy in the northern province and throughout Sri Lanka after 23 years of conflict.        
	The President assured me that this was his intent. We will work together with the government of Sri Lanka to enable all Sri Lankans, and particularly the Tamil community who have borne the brunt of the effects of the conflict, to lead normal lives as soon as possible.        
	Mukherjee said Rajapakse had invited an all-party delegation from Tamil Nadu, led by chief minister M. Karunanidhi and ADMK leader Jayalalithaa, to see for themselves the situation on the ground and to persuade the LTTE to lay down arms and join the democratic mainstream.        
	The leaders also discussed the 13th amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution that provides for devolution and autonomy to northern and eastern provinces so that the legitimate aspirations of the ethnic minorities are fulfilled.        
	The President assured me this would be the area of his urgent attention and he will try to explore possibilities and improve the conditions there, Mukherjee said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                      Police cordon off the area outside the Guwahati court before producing Ulfa leaders Arabinda Rajkhowa and Raju Barua on Saturday. Several people flocked to the court premises to catch a glimpse of the leaders. Eastern Projections                            
	Guwahati, Dec. 5: What was meant to be the governments show of success today threw up an unexpected public display of support for Ulfa, with the outfits chairman, Arabinda Rajkhowa, and its deputy commander-in-chief, Raju Barua, rubbishing police claims that they had surrendered.        
	We have not surrendered, we will never surrender, Rajkhowa and Barua thundered today as they were produced in the court of chief judicial magistrate, Kamrup, Robin Phukan.         
	Around 5.30pm, shouts of Ulfa zindabad and Rajkhowa zindabad rent the air as the two militants appeared. A large number of people were waiting on the court premises since morning for a glimpse of the two elusive leaders.         
	The slogans in support of Ulfa were heard when the duo and Rajkhowas bodyguard Raja Baruah were brought into the court and then led out after the CJM sent the trio to 12 days police remand.        
	When Rajkhowa and Barua emerged, they first denied having surrendered and then asserted there could be no talks if Assams sovereignty was not included in the main agenda.                     Raju Barua at the court       
	The crowd urged the leaders not to surrender. Surrender nokoribo (do not surrender), they shouted. Rajkhowa obliged, saying surrender nokoru moi (I will never surrender) to wild cheers from the crowd. If I would have surrendered, then I would not have been brought to the court handcuffed, he said.         
	Raju Barua said: Moi surrender kora nai aru surrender nokoru (I have not surrendered and will never surrender).        
	The special superintendent of police, P.C. Saloi, was standing at hand-shaking distance of the sloganeers, surrounded by a large posse of armed policemen.         
	Advocates Bijon Mahajan, Arshad Choudhury and Pranab Kumar Das appeared on behalf of the Ulfa leaders. Mahajan said the police sought 14 days custody in connection with a special operation unit (SOU) case.        
	After coming out of the courtroom, Rajkhowa told reporters that he felt insulted by the medias questions on his surrender.         
	 The person who wants to return to his motherland wearing garlands of victory is wearing handcuffs today. You have insulted our sacrifice for our motherland by asking about surrender. We also want peace. But there will be no peace talk with handcuffs, Rajkhowa said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Dec. 6: The Bihar government has rushed a two-member fact-finding team to Ludhiana in Punjab where migrant labourers from the state clashed with police and local people over the administrations alleged failure to provide security to workers.        
	The team, comprising a joint labour commissioner and deputy labour commissioner, was sent to Ludhiana last evening to find out facts about the incident and talk to the Punjab government officials on the issue, labour resources department principal secretary Vyas ji Mishra said.        
	Sources said the labourers from Bihar indulged in violence and arson in an industrial area of Ludhiana when the police refused to entertain their complaint of snatching of belongings from a worker on Friday. The local administration clamped curfew in parts of Ludhiana to curb the fury of workers from Bihar.        
	Mishra said the state government was very concerned about the security of migrant workers.         
	The officials of the team had been instructed to persuade their Punjab counterparts to take corrective measures so that the migrant workers were not harassed or subjected to maltreatment at their workplace, he said.        
	Bihar chief secretary Anup Mukherjee, the sources said, spoke to his Punjab counterpart urging the latter to ensure safety and security of the migrant workers there.         
	Bihar home secretary Amir Subhani, too, has written a letter to the officials concerned in Punjab home department to intensify police patrolling in the areas inhabited by Bihar workers.         
	Sources in the labour department here said the migrant labourers from Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh had contributed in a big way in making Punjab a successful state in agriculture.         
	Quoting the Punjab agriculture departments estimate, they added that the western state required 7 lakh labourers to cultivate its 26 lakh hectares farmland in every rabi and kharif season. Bihar and eastern UP constitute the main source of such a large labour force required in Punjab, they said.        
	Besides, Ludhiana is an industrial city and home to several big brands like Hero Honda and Oswal which have employed a large number of migrant workers from Bihar, eastern UP and other parts of the country. One third of Ludhianas population is said to have workers from Bihar, UP and elsewhere.         
	In such a situation, it is the primary duty of the Punjab administration to ensure safety and security of the workers from other states working in Punjab, Mishra said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 23: Rajnath Singhs last hurrah ended in a whimper today.        
	The former BJP president was hoping to sign off his tenure  he demitted office a week before it was to end  with a victory for his party in Jharkhand. Indeed, Singh had hoped to gift a win to Atal Bihari Vajpayee on his birthday on December 25 and mentioned it in his speeches in the Jharkhand campaign.        
	It was Atalji who initiated the process of a separate Jharkhand state and gifted the people a new state in 2000. The counting of votes will take place on December 23 and Ataljis birthday is on December 25. I appeal to the people of Jharkhand to gift an NDA government to Vajpayee on his birthday, he had told a meeting in Ranchi.        
	Jharkhand had a special place for Rajnath. In 2005, before the RSS anointed Rajnath as the BJP president, he was sent to Ranchi by L.K. Advani to put together a majority after the hung verdict in which the BJP emerged as the single largest party.        
	Rajnath had a record for breaking and making coalitions in Uttar Pradesh and not sparing any party, including the Congress. Rajnath succeeded in Jharkhand.        
	However, on Wednesday, when it was evident that the BJP was unlikely to repeat the 2005 performance of 30 seats, Rajnath kept a low profile. He attended the parliamentary board meeting chaired by his successor Nitin Gadkari but left soon after.        
	Several other leaders, including Arun Jaitley and M. Venkaiah Naidu, stayed on to help Gadkari pick his way through the political thicket he now inhabits.        
	Had the BJP won Jharkhand, Rajnath could have partially redeemed his innings that was marked by acrimonious rivalries, oneupmanship and an uneven record at the hustings.         
	The irony was when the BJP won one election after another in Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka and Uttarakhand, Rajnath was least credited for the victories. The applause went to either Narendra Modi or Jaitley, the general secretary then in charge of Karnataka and Himachal.        
	But when the BJP later lost a series of polls  Uttar Pradesh, Lok Sabha and Maharashtra  the knives were out for Rajnath.        
	In Jharkhand, Rajnath is being blamed for letting a few local MPs with business links to distribute tickets to unwinnable candidates and allegedly scuttling a proposal to bring back Babulal Marandi to the BJP.

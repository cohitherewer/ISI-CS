The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Auction room with a view
                                                                                                               Auction room with a view
          AMIT ROY                           The Thugs of India: Halt at the Shrine of Ganesh painting at the Ismail Merchant auction at Christies in London                                  
	London, Oct. 7: James Ivory stood in front of a Satyajit Ray poster at Christies in London yesterday and witnessed what his friend Ismail Merchant would have called an auction room with a view.         
	I dont feel sad, Ivory told The Telegraph as he took in the view of the possessions of Merchant as they went under the hammer and fetched a total of 653,000.         
	The surviving half of Merchant Ivory Productions, which garnered six Oscars and 31 nominations during the remarkable 41-year partnership, explained himself: No, I dont feel sad but it is strange to see these things all together in this one room when I have seen them dispersed in apartments in London and Paris and Bombay and New York and upstate New York.         
	He looked at the catalogue photograph of Merchant and remembered: That was taken on the set of In Custody.                         Ismail Merchant on the set of In Custody in India in 1993; Ivory in front of a Mahanagar poster at the auction       
	Merchant, who was born in Bombay in 1936 and died in London in 2005, had always lived elegantly, filling his apartments with fine china and pottery, carpets from all over the world, paintings, especially from the Company School, exquisite furniture and handicrafts.         
	They could have resembled a film set  indeed Merchant often acquired objects which he had bought for his movies  but he put them together so that his apartments invariably exuded refined Indo-British taste.         
	In the auction of The Ismail Merchant Collection, held yesterday at Christies in South Kensington, were a number of film posters, including notably Rays Mahanagar and Charulata.         
	As they went for 4,000, against a reserve price of 300-500, Ivory recalled how he and Merchant had worked with the American Academy of Motion Pictures to have nine Ray classics restored and remastered.         
	That was very important for us, he said.         
	A group Of six Bengal plaster figures from the mid-19th century went for 3,750; a painting, Dassehra: The crowds gather at the river to immerse the image of Durga, from the Calcutta School, circa 1870, oil on canvas, fetched 875; and Two Musicians, from the Kalighat School, circa 1850, was bought for 1,000.         
	Ivory has been working since February to put the auction together on behalf of Merchants estate.         
	The fact that the sale did so well, nearly reaching its top estimate, is a tribute to Ismail Merchants taste as a collector, and the variety of all the objects he assembled, he reflected. There was something for everyone. What a pity he wasnt at Christies this morning  how he would have loved it!         
	Ivory collaborated with Amin Jaffer, international director of Asian art at Christies, who was headhunted from the Victoria amp; Albert Museum to develop the auction houses India business.         
	A glimpse at the collection reveals immediately that Ismail was a man of broad artistic and intellectual interests, with a deep interest in cross-cultural exchange, and in particular the relationship between India and Britain, said Jaffer.         
	He added: I especially like the painting by August Theodor Schoefft, The Thugs of India: Halt at the Shrine of Ganesh, a technically accomplished and sophisticated work that captures something of the culture of 19th-century India.         
	This was the highlight of the auction and went for 91,250.         
	Bids came in by phone and on the Internet but among those present was travel writer William Dalrymple, who picked up a Bidri bell-shaped spitoon, Deccan, circa 1850 for 500, though the reserve price was 800-1,200.         
	He had come determined to give something a good home.

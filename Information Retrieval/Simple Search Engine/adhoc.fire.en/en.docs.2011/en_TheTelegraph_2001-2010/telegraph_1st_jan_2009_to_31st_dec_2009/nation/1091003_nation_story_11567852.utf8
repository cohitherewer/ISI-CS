The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Flight grounds first lap of IAF training
                                                                                                               Flight grounds first lap of IAF training
          SUJAN DUTTA                          An HPT-32 aircraft                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 2: A new batch of cadets for the Indian Air Force that begins preparing this month will be forced to skip its first lessons in flying because the basic trainer aircraft in the Air Force Academy have been grounded.        
	All air force pilots for its fighter and transport aircraft graduate from the Dundigal, Hyderabad, academy but this season the Hindustan Piston Trainer-32 (HPT-32) on which they first take wing have been kept back in hangars.        
	The desperation in the IAF is grave because it upsets the training schedule. It takes about five years to make a fighter pilot fully operational and the procedures institutionalised. The first rung of the flying training is in the HPT-32.         
	Worried, air force headquarters have drilled it into the defence ministry that this situation cannot be sustained for more than a year.         
	The total number of cadets vary from batch to batch. Last December, 97 cadets passed out from the academy and this June the figure was 173.        
	The air force is studying whether to scrap the basic trainer aircraft made by the defence public sector unit Hindustan Aeronautics, Air Chief Marshal Pradeep Vasant Naik said here on Thursday. He said there were fundamental problems with the HPT-32 in integrating its engine with its airframe.        
	An investigation into a crash on July 31 has established that the aircraft engine simply died in mid-air and all efforts by the experienced pilots to revive it had failed.         
	A committee led by Air Vice-Marshal Pradeep Singh has been asked to find out whether the single engine turbo-prop aircraft can continue to be airworthy till 2014.        
	The HPT-32s were grounded after two senior flying instructors were killed when the trainer they were flying crashed near Medak in Andhra Pradesh on July 31.         
	A worried air headquarters is scouting the global market for a replacement that will prove to be expensive because of the numbers involved. The air chief marshal said the IAF would need at least 80.        
	Another estimate by an air force officer said 150 was a realistic figure. There are more than 100 HPT-32s with the IAF.         
	The HPT-32s were first introduced in 1984 but repeated accidents and loss of lives of cadets and instructors have forced air headquarters to make an urgent plea to the government for a replacement.        
	Naik said the academy had resorted to an all-jet training of cadets selected for the flying branch. This means that this batch onwards the first aircraft that the rookies will fly are the Kiran Mark II sub-sonic jet aircraft, much more capable than the HPT-32, and therefore also more demanding.         
	The Kirans are also old  of 1960s vintage. The Kirans have so far been used for stage-II training and the British Aerospace Hawk Advanced Jet aircraft for stage-III training. The cadets will be skipping stage-I training on HPT-32s and move on to stage-II training on the jets from classroom and simulator lessons.        
	The HPT-32 is a three-seater aircraft  two seats side-by-side in the cockpit for the flying instructor and the cadet and a single seat just behind for another cadet or a supervisor.         
	Naik said the forced changes in the training schedule measure would also put an additional demand on the Kiran aircraft that are also limited, because now both stage-I and stage-II trainees will be sharing them.        
	Hindustan Aeronautics has sent out requests for information on at least five aircraft that could replace the HPT-32 T-6 Texan(Raytheon), G-120TP (Grob), M-311 (Finmeccanica), PC-21 (Pilatus) and Tucano (Embraer).

	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 2: Keeping his voter base in mind, Naveen Patnaik launched the BJDs 10-day mass contact campaign from the citys biggest slum at Saliasahi today.        
	The launch of the campaign coincided with the partys ongoing drive with a target to enrol at least 50 lakh members.        
	With a view to bond with the masses, Naveen walked down a few hundred yards to the venue and interacted with slum-dwellers by moving from door to door after the meeting.         
	What are the problems faced by you, he asked Tilottama Sahu, a 60-year-old slum dweller.        
	We dont have electricity, safe drinking water and toilet, replied the woman in Oriya.         
	Standing next to her, Keshi Patra said the entire slum depended upon a small well for drinking water.         
	Naveen, accompanied by local MLA Bhagirathi Badjena and city mayor Ananta Narayan Jena, asked residents whether they were getting Rs 2 per kg rice and old age/widow pensions regularly. Also, whether basic healthcare was available to them or not.        
	He even asked a girl whether she went to school or not.         
	The slum-dwellers demanded permanent rehabilitation with all basic civic amenities like electricity, drinking water, housing and sanitation facilities. The chief minister then assured them he would to provide power in the immediate future.        
	Earlier, addressing the gathering, Naveen said he had entrusted IIT, Kharagpur, with the preparation of a comprehensive development plan for the city with special focus on resettlement of slums.        
	Badjena said the chief minister had recently deputed a team of legislators, civic body representatives and officials to Mumbai and Ahmedabad to study slum development models there.         
	Naveen said it was time for party workers to go to the people and try to solve their problems since the BJD was in power in the state for 10 years.        
	Listing out development and welfare measures implemented by his government, Naveen said emphasis had been laid on agriculture, irrigation, rural development, poverty alleviation, employment generation and womens empowerment.        
	Rajya Sabha member and BJDs master strategist Pyarimohan Mohapatra said Naveen believed in peaceful development of the state, hinting the Orissa government was against forcible eviction of people for the sake of industrialisation.        
	Mohapatra called upon party workers to mobilise members in order to strengthen the hands of Naveen for fulfilling the dreams of legendary leader Biju Patnaik and make Orissa the numero uno state of India.

	Mumbai, Dec. 29 (PTI): Bombay High Court has held that habitual absence from office without taking leave or giving prior intimation amounts to misconduct on the part of the employee.        
	We are of the view that an employee who is in the habit of remaining absent without prior sanction of leave, irrespective of the number of days, is guilty of misconduct under the rules, said a division bench recently while upholding the dismissal of a Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited employee.        
	Pandurang Kevne had filed a petition challenging his removal.        
	Justices J.N. Patel and R.P. Sondurbaldota also observed: In our opinion, the reason for such misconduct is because it exhibits irresponsibility and lack of interest in work. It is writ large on the facts of the case that the petitioner is least interested in (his) duty.        
	The bench referred to Rule 3 of the Central Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, 1964, which says a government servant must at all times maintain absolute integrity and devotion to duty.        
	A person who is in the habit of remaining absent without prior sanction of leave and remains absent for a long period of more than 10 days without leave or intimation is not somebody who is devoted to duty or maintains integrity, the court said.        
	The petitioners conduct needs to be tested on this anvil, the judges said.

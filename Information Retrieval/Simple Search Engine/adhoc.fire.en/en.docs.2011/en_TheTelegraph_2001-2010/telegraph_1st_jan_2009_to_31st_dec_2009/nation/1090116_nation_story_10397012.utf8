          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 15: India today reacted strongly to views expressed by US foreign secretary David Miliband on Jammu and Kashmir, saying New Delhi did not need unsolicited advice on internal issues in India.        
	In an article published today in The Guardian newspaper, Miliband, currently visiting India, said: The Lashkar-e-Toiba has roots in Pakistan and says its cause is Kashmir.        
	In the article titled War on Terror Was Wrong, Miliband wrote: Although I understand the current difficulties, resolution of the dispute over Kashmir would help deny extremists in the region one of their main calls to arms, and allow Pakistani authorities to focus more effectively on tackling the threat on their western borders.         
	Foreign ministry spokesperson Vishnu Prakash said: Mr Miliband is entitled to his views, which are clearly his own and are evolving. India is a free country and, even if we do not share his view, he is free to express them. However, we do not need unsolicited advice on internal issues in India like J amp;K.

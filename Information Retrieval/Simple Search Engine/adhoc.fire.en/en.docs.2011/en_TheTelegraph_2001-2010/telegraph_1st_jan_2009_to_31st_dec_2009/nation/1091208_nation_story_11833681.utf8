The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Eye on Jharkhand polls for Bihar pie
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Eye on Jharkhand polls for Bihar pie
          NALIN VERMA                          Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad campaign in Jharkhand                                  
	Patna, Dec. 7: Be it Lalu Prasad or Nitish Kumar, be it the Congress or the BJP, the stakes are high for Bihars high-profile leaders and mainstream political parties in the ongoing polls in neighbouring Jharkhand.        
	Smarting from the September by-election drubbing in Bihar, Nitish apparently wants the NDA to stage a comeback in Jharkhand ahead of the Assembly elections in Bihar next year. The JD(U) is contesting only 15 seats in Jharkhand but Nitish carried out an aggressive campaign there. In the process, he showcased his governments achievement in Bihar while promising a similar dispensation if the NDA came to power.        
	Nitish is believed to be aware that if the Congress performs better in Jharkhand, the party of Sonia Gandhi will get further impetus to revive itself in Bihar ahead of the Assembly polls. The Congress, on the hand, has followed up on its experiment to go to the polls without striking an alliance with any mainstream regional parties.        
	Except with the fledgling Jharkhand Vikas Morcha of Babulal Marandi, the Congress has kept itself away from the company of the Left, JMM and Lalu Prasads RJD. Observers describe the move as the Congresss well-orchestrated strategy to revive itself in the region.        
	The wily RJD boss knows it well that his party alone cannot form the next government in Jharkhand. But keeping a hawks eye on the Assembly polls due next year in his native state, Lalu Prasad has been working overtime to prevent the Congress from forming a government on its own.        
	If the RJD boss has his way, he would like to win enough seats to play a decisive role in the post-poll scenario. He (Lalu) will be the happiest person if the Congress falls short and approaches him for the formation of a UPA government in Jharkhand, said a senior RJD leader, adding: His primary objective is to make the Congress dependent on him in the run-up to the Assembly elections in Bihar.        
	Among the contenders, however, the BJP appears to have biggest stake in Jharkhand. Suffering from humiliation in Maharashtra, Delhi and Rajasthan and riddled by infighting, the BJP is expecting Jharkhand to infuse much-needed oxygen to it.         
	The party hopes that the anti-incumbency factor coupled with the investigating agencies putting the Congress-supported former chief minister Madhu Koda in the dock, will inspire voters to opt for the BJP.

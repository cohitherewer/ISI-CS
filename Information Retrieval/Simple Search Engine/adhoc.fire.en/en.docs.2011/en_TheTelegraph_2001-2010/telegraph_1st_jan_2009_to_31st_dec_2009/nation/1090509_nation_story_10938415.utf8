          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 8: The Union cabinet today recommended revocation of Presidents rule in Meghalaya, paving the way for a Congress-NCP alliance and raising prospects of cementing ties in Delhi after the elections.        
	The new dispensation in Shillong is likely to have a Congress chief minister and an NCP deputy chief minister. D.D. Lapangs name was cleared as chief minister while former Lok Sabha Speaker P.A. Sangmas son, Conrad, was agreed upon for deputy chief minister, sources said.         
	By wooing Sangma, the Congress hopes to calm the frayed nerves of the NCP and lay the foundation for projecting the UPA as a united entity.

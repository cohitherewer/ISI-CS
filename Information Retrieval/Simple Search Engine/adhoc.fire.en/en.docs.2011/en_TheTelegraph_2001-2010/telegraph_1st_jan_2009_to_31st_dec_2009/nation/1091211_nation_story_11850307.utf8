          SHYAM G. MENON                              
	What do you feel if you have your own separate state?         
	In my view there is only one gain and that is the luxury of accommodation within a smaller power unit with all the perks of the erstwhile bigger power thrown in. You get your own Assembly, compact electorate, easier avenue to political power  all of it disguised as cultural aspiration when basically it is good old male ego marking territory.         
	This is the sad story of Indias fragmenting polity.         
	Its social values still feudal, the countrys primary illness of bad governance continues unchecked despite new states and movements. Yet you cant deny societies the right to fragment for fragmenting is the only way to counter the rot in monolithic power centres. As in the free market, in the political bazaar too enterprise means digging deeper for a more addictive consumer.        
	The night Telangana was approved the world was debating the problem of excess and its impact on climate change at Copenhagen. I wonder what happens when you divide a state into two  do you streamline administration or do you author excess?         
	What is political power if you dont have your own dams, power stations, police force and highways to lord over?         
	For sure small is the way to go because when it comes to managing our lives, smaller power centres are easier to cope with than the large. But there is a need for convincing math in cultural aspiration; the sort which examines the economic viability in replicating state machinery.         
	You cant fragment for your song and dance and leave the math to the centre like a toddler living under its nannys watch. Besides, if the emergent moves are tracing cartography of the old, then we are not dealing with smaller power units for greater administrative efficiency but trends to reorganise for cultural cohesiveness.         
	I wonder how any of this helps to address the pressing problems of our times. Will it bring the rain, reduce farmer suicides?        
	For me, Telangana is a more distant issue than Copenhagen.         
	Whats going on in the Danish capital may be bad politics but the reasons for meeting there are clear. At its very core is the less publicised message that excess entails cost and nothing is costlier for the planet right now than its human population  be it as per capita consumption and emission or at gross level.         
	All the preceding decades of grey in the climate debate are slowly boiling to black and white choices as crime in one corner elicits toll in another and the whole cobweb becomes a shared concern.         
	Paradoxically, the squeeze on resources and the tangible threat to life have gathered disparate cultures on the same platform. If the planet has been brought together by lives lost to natural disaster then Indias contribution to the idea of one-planet is right up there.        
	After all, South Asia is where the worlds miseries come to roost.                             THE AUTHOR IS A FREELANCE WRITER BASED IN MUMBAI

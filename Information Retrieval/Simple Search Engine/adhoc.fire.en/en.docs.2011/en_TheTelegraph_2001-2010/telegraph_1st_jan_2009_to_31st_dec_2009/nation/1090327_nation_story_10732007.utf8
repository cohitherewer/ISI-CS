The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | I wanted Rahul as minister: PM   Singh, Rahul: Call to youth
                                                                                                               I wanted Rahul as minister: PM     - Singh barb at Left self-praise        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Singh, Rahul: Call to youth                                      
	New Delhi, March 26: Manmohan Singh today revealed he had offered Rahul Gandhi a ministers post but the Amethi MP had refused.        
	I have been urging him to become a minister for a long time but he has been refusing, the Prime Minister told reporters on the sidelines of a defence function.        
	Sources close to him had earlier said Singh had wanted Rahul as sports minister. Only when he was certain that Rahul would not change his mind did he induct another young Congress MP, Jyotiraditya Scindia, into his council of ministers, they had added.        
	Congress sources claimed Rahul would definitely become a minister if the UPA was re-elected. Singh today said: Ultimately, it is the youths who should be handed over power.        
	Asked about the Rashtriya Janata Dal, Lok Janshakti Party and the PMK parting ways with the UPA, he said: I think elections are unpredictable. But I have no doubt that the people will recognise what is at stake. People will respond. People are the best judge. I leave it to the people of India to decide what is right.        
	He said the PMKs departure from the UPA had nothing to do with the Congress. It is because of local politics in Tamil Nadu.        
	Asked how many marks he would award his government, the Prime Minister replied: It is for you to judge.        
	Reminded that he had given the government seven out of 10 at the end of his first year, he said: Well, it must be better than that.        
	Singh was scornful of the Left parties tendency to claim credit for all the good things done by the UPA government while they supported it, and for blocking all the bad things. He said: This is self-praise. I think history will judge.        
	Singh, however, said the government was very conscious of the fact that a lot more needed to be done. We still have a long way to go to finish the unfinished agenda. That is why we are seeking the mandate.        
	Asked about the hints from the Left that it was not averse to backing the Congress after the polls, Singh said: I hope that situation will not arise. We will be able to form the government (on our own).

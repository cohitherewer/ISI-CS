The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP plays dual card
                                                                                                               BJP plays dual card
          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, April 6: The BJPs dual strategy of exploiting both development and communalism has come to the fore yet again.        
	The campaign material released today by Arun Jaitley is development-oriented, but a subtle message has been sent out by party boss Rajnath Singh visiting Varun Gandhi in Etah jail.        
	The BJPs main audio-visual is an elaborate statement on Team Advani. Although the theme of the two-minute song is development, the partys attempt to cash in on A.B. Vajpayees charisma is evident in the ailing leader being given prime space.        
	The visual starts with Vajpayees famous speech of 1980 in Mumbai in which he had predicted the BJPs imminent rise to power at the Centre. Other leaders, including Advani, are given a brief mention. Rajnath, Jaitley, Narendra Modi, Sushma Swaraj, Jaswant Singh, Murli Manohar Joshi and many more feature in the film.        
	The film does not touch on Hindutva, addresses all sections of society and carries a pragati ka paigam (message of progress). It is unlike the overtly anti-minority CD the party had released before the 2007 Uttar Pradesh elections.        
	Whatever the tenor of the national campaign, Rajnaths visit to Etah jail is being seen as a signal that the BJP may adopt a 2007-type anti-minority strategy in Uttar Pradesh.         
	Sources said the impression was growing because Rajnath had made time to call on Varun despite his tight electioneering schedule. He had also declared that the BJP will not keep quiet.        
	Rajnath said: We will stand by Varun politically and legally as he is being harassed for political reasons.        
	The RSS, too, is sending unambiguous signals: not only did the Organiser editorial support Varun last week, Sangh number two Bhaiyya Joshi has defended the contents of Varuns speech in the latest issue.        
	VHP leader Praveen Togadia has also backed Varun.        
	Asked about the continuing support to Varun, Jaitley said: The BJP feels the imposition of the National Security Act was wrong, both in the context of the Constitution and democracy. The state governments use of NSA against a candidate in the middle of election appears vindictive and disproportionate. We dont have any objection if the EC punishes him for the contents of his speech.        
	The BJPs dual strategy is at play in Jammu and Kashmir and Orissa, too. While the BJP has relied totally on the Jammu-Valley divide in the northern state, the RSS has taken charge of the campaign in Orissa.        
	In Jammu, BJP candidates are reminding voters of the Amarnath agitation and portraying Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah as agents of Pakistan and the Congress as their lackey. In Orissa, the BJP has given tickets to the main riot accused of Kandhamal.

          JOHN MARY                              
	Thiruvananthapuram, Dec. 17: The CPM was today forced to act against electoral ally Abdul Nasser Madhani by arresting his wife for her alleged role in the burning of a bus in Kerala four years ago.         
	Sufiya Madhani, 34, the wife of the Peoples Democratic Party chairman, was arrested in Kochi today after Kerala High Court rejected her plea for anticipatory bail.        
	Justice K.T. Sankaran found prima facie evidence of the involvement of Sufiya, named as the tenth accused in the burning of the bus at Kalamassery near Kochi on September 9, 2005.         
	The arson was aimed at trying to whip up pressure for her husbands release from Coimbatore jail, where he was lodged on charges of plotting the 1998 serial blasts in the Tamil Nadu city in which 58 people died. Madhani, in his late forties, has since been acquitted in the case.        
	The arrest of Sufiya is certain to strengthen the hand of chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan in his tussle against Pinarayi Vijayan, the graft-accused state secretary of the CPM.         
	Vijayan had championed the poll alliance with the PDP. The pact, opposed by Achuthanandan, boomeranged with the Left winning only four of 20 Lok Sabha seats and none in the byelections.        
	The chief minister had hinted yesterday he would use the issue to get even. We will have no truck with the PDP any more, not now, not in the future, Achuthanandan said.         
	Sufiyas arrest follows relentless media pressure on the ruling Left Democratic Front to act, instead of shielding an electoral ally from the law.        
	A special investigation team was privy to crucial confessions and transcripts of calls made from mobile phones of the suspects, especially Sufiya, before and after the bus burning. But the police, apparently under pressure from higher-ups, told the court it wasnt sufficient to nail her.         
	The situation changed with the police in Karnataka, ruled by the CPMs foe BJP, getting custody of Lashkar-e-Toiba operative T. Nazir, mastermind of the Bangalore blasts of July 2008 and the first accused in the bus case. Nazir was arrested by the Bangladesh Rifles from the Meghalaya border and handed over to India.        
	Madhani said he would fight the case to the last. Its the first time that a woman, and that, too, a woman in purdah, holding fast to her religion, was being hounded out, said Madhani, himself the victim of a deadly bomb attack in 1992 in which he lost a leg.         
	In a curious coincidence, a court today acquitted five persons accused in the case relating to the bomb attack.

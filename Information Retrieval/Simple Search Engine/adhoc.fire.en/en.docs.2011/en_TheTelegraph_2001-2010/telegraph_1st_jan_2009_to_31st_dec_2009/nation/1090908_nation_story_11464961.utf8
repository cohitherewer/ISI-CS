	Thiruvananthapuram, Sept. 7: A high-profile and politicised murder case in Kerala has become more intriguing with a blacksmith claiming he had made an S-shaped knife, the alleged murder weapon, on the orders of police.        
	The police had in full glare of TV cameras recovered the knife from under a cot at the home of main suspect Kaari Satheesh, accused of killing Paul M. George, 27, scion of leading business house Muthoot M. George group.        
	Satheeshs arrest had prompted state CPM secretary Pinarayi Vijayan to call a news conference and claim the assassin was an RSS man, and suggest the S-shaped knife used by the RSS was the clincher. Satheeshs family alleged the police had planted the knife at their home.        
	The Asianet News channel today claimed that soon after the murder, Alappuzha (north) circle inspector K.A. Thomas had approached a local blacksmith and asked him to make an S-shaped knife.        
	The blacksmith, whose identity was withheld, told reporters  who were disguised as police  that the officer had sketched the shape of the knife on a piece of paper. He claimed the police had paid him Rs 500 and that he had with him a smaller knife, ordered by the same officer.         
	George was found murdered on a highway on August 21 night. Three days later, the police said a man named Kaari Satheesh had killed George with an S-shaped knife in a fit of road rage.        
	The police later brought Satheesh home in handcuffs and fetched the weapon. Satheeshs grandmother claims she saw policemen place something under the cot after entering their house. Satheeshs mother today moved court for a CBI probe.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Srinagar, Jan. 7: The gun battle between security forces and militants holed up in the hilly forests of Poonch entered its second week today but the army said it was deliberately going slow to avoid casualties.        
	Army guns blazed in Srinagar, too, as soldiers shot dead a man 100 metres from the home of Kashmirs new chief minister Omar Abdullah.        
	In Poonch, the rebels, said to be hiding in caves in Mendhar, fired at security forces twice this morning.        
	There was firing around 6 and 9am from two different locations but it was repulsed, defence spokesperson S.N. Acharya said.         
	He put the number of militants still hiding at six to seven, up from yesterdays estimate of two to three.         
	In Srinagar, an army spokesman said Abdul Rashid Reshi of Pahalgam scaled the rear wall of Omars residential compound on Gupkar Road around 10 last night.         
	The intruder, despite being challenged repeatedly, continued to run towards the residence. The sentries then fired on the individual resulting in his death.        
	The army, which has ordered a probe, did not rule out the possibility that the 45-year-old was on a reconnaissance mission with the aim of launching a fidayeen attack at a later date.        
	Rashids sister said he had a speech and hearing problem. He had come from Pahalgam to visit us but lost his way, she said. He accidentally strayed into Gupkar.

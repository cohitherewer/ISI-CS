The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mental   test nod in marital row
                                                                                                               Mental   test nod in marital row
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Aug. 6: The Supreme Court has held that family courts can order medical examination of alleged mental illness, a frequently used ground for seeking divorce.        
	A two-judge bench, which ordered a medical board to examine a womans mental state at the husbands instance, conceded there was no law that could force either spouse to take such a test. But it said courts had inherent powers to get to the truth of a matter.         
	It is true the Hindu Marriage Act or any other law does not contain any express provision to compel him/her to a medical examination. But, in our view, it does not preclude the court from passing such an order, the court said in a ruling earlier this week.        
	Jabalpurs Lalit Kishore had sought an examination of his wife Meeru Sharma. The local family court and Madhya Pradesh High Court had rejected his petition. Considering that the report of the medical expert would only be an evidence, we do not find any reason why such application for appointment of a medical expert to examine the wife cannot be granted, the apex court said.        
	Some legal experts said the ruling left a lot of scope for misuse in connivance with unscrupulous medical professionals. They argued that it also went against the spirit of the Constitutions Article 20(3) under which a person couldnt be forced to be a witness against himself.

	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 7: A 13-year-old tribal student of a remote village in Keonjhar has been selected to participate at Tunza International Children and Youth Conference on Environment-2009 to be organised by United Nation Environment Programme (Unep) at Seoul in the third week of August.         
	Laxman Hembrum, a member of Juang, a primitive tribe, had sent his entry after the Unep invited papers on the theme Climate Change: Our Challenge.         
	The paper sent by Laxman has been selected among thousands of entries received from the world.         
	A student of Class IX at Kalinga Institute of Social Sciences (KISS) here, Laxman belongs to a family of labourers and is one of 10,000 students being provided residential education at KISS.        
	I am excited and so are my parents. I am confident that I will do well, said a radiant Laxman.         
	His selection is a matter of pride for us and we hope that students of KISS are able to bring more laurels at national and international forums, said A. Samanta, the KISS founder.         
	Laxman will leave for Seoul on August 15, 2009, with all his expenses to be borne by Unep.        
	As many as 750 delegates from 150 countries will be participating in this conference being organised by United Nations Environment Programme in conjunction with UNEP National Committee for the Republic of Korea.         
	It would also be supported by Daejeon Metropolitan City, the ministry of environment, the presidential committee on green growth and the ministry of education and science and technology.        
	There are only two participants from India.        
	Besides Laxman, another student from north India, Sandeep Bakshi, has also been selected, the KISS authorities said.

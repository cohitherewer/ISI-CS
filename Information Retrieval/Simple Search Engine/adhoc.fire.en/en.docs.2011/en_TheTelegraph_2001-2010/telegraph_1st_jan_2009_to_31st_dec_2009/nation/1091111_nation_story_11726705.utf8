The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Raje scores a point
                                                  Raje scores a point
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jaipur, Nov. 10: Forced to step down as leader of Opposition in Rajasthan, former chief minister Vasundhara Raje today scored a point over the BJP leadership after the party wrested an Assembly seat where she had campaigned extensively.        
	Raje campaigned for BJP candidate Ramesh Meena in Todabhim in spite of being shown the door by central BJP leaders, who were adamant on her quitting as leader of Opposition just before the bypolls on November 7.        
	Raje put in her papers on October 23 after resisting for three months. Though the majority of MLAs sided with her, she was largely ignored by the BJP brass, especially party president Rajnath Singh.        
	Political observers said she managed to wrest Todabhim, a constituency reserved for Scheduled Tribes and a Meena stronghold, by harping on the caste factor. Raje played on Gujjar sentiments, claiming her government passed a reservation bill entailing 5 per cent quota to Gujjars and other backward communities.        
	Gujjars, who form a chunk of the electorate in Todabhim, rallied behind her, voting for candidate Ramesh Meena.

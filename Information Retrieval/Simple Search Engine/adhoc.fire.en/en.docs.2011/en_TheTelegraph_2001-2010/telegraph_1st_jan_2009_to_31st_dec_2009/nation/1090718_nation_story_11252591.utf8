                                                                                                               Chargesheet after 17 years
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 17: The CBI today filed a chargesheet in the mysterious death of a Kerala nun, 17 years after her body was found in a well at the convent where she stayed.        
	The chargesheet accuses of murder two priests and a nun of the St Pius X Convent Hostel in Kottayam, where Sister Abhaya was found dead on March 27, 1992.         
	The three were arrested last November but got bail this January.        
	The state police, who had initially investigated the nuns death, had declared it a suicide.        
	But on a petition by the nuns father, Thomas Areekara, Kerala High Court directed the CBI to take up the case in 2003. Since then, the CBI had filed three closure reports saying the nun was murdered but that the suspects could not be found.         
	The court refused to accept this and ordered the CBI to probe further.        
	The three key accused are Father Thomas Kottoor, Diocesan chancellor of the Catholic Church, Father Thomas Poothrikkayil, a former professor of a Kottayam college where Abhaya had studied, and Sister Sephy of the convent.        
	Four others  a nun, retired superintendent of police K.T. Michael and two women employees of the convent  will have to undergo narco-analysis tests.         
	The chargesheet, filed in the court of the chief judicial magistrate, Ernakulam, also names a fourth accused, former additional sub-inspector V.V. Augustine, for having allegedly destroyed evidence.         
	He was found dead last November under mysterious circumstances.        
	A suicide note blaming the CBI for his death was found near the body of Augustine in his house at Chingavanam, near Kottayam. His wrists were slit. The note said: The CBI is responsible.         
	A day before he was found dead, the agency had obtained a statement from Augustine, who was the first police officer to reach the scene of crime. He had been subjected to brain mapping in 2007.

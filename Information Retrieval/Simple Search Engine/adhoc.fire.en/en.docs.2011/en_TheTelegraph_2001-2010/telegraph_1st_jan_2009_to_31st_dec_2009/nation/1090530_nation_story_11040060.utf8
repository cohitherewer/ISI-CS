The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | From IQ, Joshi shifts focus to job scheme
                                                                                                               From IQ, Joshi shifts focus to job scheme
          CITHARA PAUL                               
	New Delhi, May 29: From a professor of psychology with specialisation in IQ to a cabinet minister in charge of rural development and panchayati raj is a long way  but C.P. Joshi seems to have traversed it with ease.        
	Joshi, who is also Rajasthan Congress president, today took charge of both ministries, placed under a single minister for the first time.        
	Joshi was no surprise choice as he had evinced interest in the ministries from the day he was sworn in.        
	Speaking after taking over at Krishi Bhavan, Joshi said ensuring proper security to volunteers involved in social audit and implementation of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) at the grassroots would be among his priorities. All volunteers involved in social audit under NREGA should be given protection.        
	The volunteers, usually from NGOs, assess whether the benefits of the public works scheme are reaching the right people. One of them was killed last year, apparently after he discovered some irregularities.        
	Echoing Rahul Gandhi, who is said to have personally chosen him for the job, Joshi said he wanted to unite Bharat and India. The suggestion was that equal emphasis would be placed on the development of villages and cities.        
	Asked why he had chosen to become rural development minister, Joshi said: I have interest in the social sector. I will try to put in my best efforts as a minister in this sector.         
	Joshi is said to have swung the December 2008 Rajasthan election results in favour of the Congress  though he himself lost his traditional Nathdwara seat by just one vote. He repeated the success this time, with the Congress walking away with 20 of Rajasthans 25 parliamentary seats.         
	The ministrys bureaucrats seem to be enthused about their new boss. They are also happy that both the rural development and panchayat raj ministries have come under the same person.         
	There had been several occasions of friction between the two ministries over overlapping interests. The most recent example of discord had been the abolition of the district rural development agency by the rural development ministry despite opposition from the panchayati raj ministry.

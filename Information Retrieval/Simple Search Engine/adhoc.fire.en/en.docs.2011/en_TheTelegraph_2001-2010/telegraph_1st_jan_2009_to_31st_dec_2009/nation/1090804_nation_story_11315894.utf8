The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bihar grapples with flood, drought
                                                                                                               Bihar grapples with flood, drought
          NALIN VERMA                           Chief minister Nitish Kumar. (Deepak Kumar)                                  
	Patna, Aug. 3: The breach on the embankment of the Bagmati at Tilaktajpur village under Runi Saidpur block of north Bihars Sitamarhi district was allegedly made on Friday night, as some local officials have pointed out to chief minister Nitish Kumar.        
	The breach led to river water spreading over six blocks under Sitamarhi and Muzaffarpur districts, and led to several residents fleeing their homes in search of higher ground.         
	Nitish Kumar, who carried out an aerial survey of the areas submerged, has promised a quintal of foodgrain and Rs 200 each to the families yesterday.        
	During the visit, local officials pointed out to the chief minister that they believed the breach to be man-made. Heeding their charges, Nitish Kumar has also constituted a probe team to be led by Tirhut commissioner and deputy inspector-general of Tirhut range.        
	Let the probe report arrive. Culprits will not be spared, said Nitish Kumar talking to The Telegraph today.         
	The officials reportedly told the chief minister that the people involved executed the breach apparently to divert water in areas other than their own villages.        
	People involved apparently have done a bigger damage to the state by diverting the administrations attention from the draught that has affected more than 34 of the 38 districts, undergoing rainless days.        
	In fact, Nitish Kumar today admitted: The draught is the real worry. I have assigned ministers to carry out a survey of the draught-hit districts and submit reports on which the government could take measures to deal with the situation. He was attending the janata durbar.        
	He further said that for now there was no need to airdrop food in the flood-affected areas, as people were being taken care of at flood shelters. Villagers are expected to go back to their homes soon as about 800 workers engaged in relief work completed their work last night. Moreover, the Centre rushed three companies of NDRF and 20 motorised boats that rescued several people.        
	According to experts, the Bihar government should concentrate more on the spectre of famine looming large on the state. Except Purnea, almost all other districts have so far received 50 to 60 per cent less rainfall than usual and farmers are still looking skywards for rain.        
	Though weather office predicts that the state should witness substantial rains after August 5 or 6, farmers in 30 districts have not transplanted their paddy saplings, yet.         
	Those in Old Sahabad district assisted by the Son canal system and in western part of north Bihar (including Siwan and Gopalganj) which have the Gandak canal system, are relatively better off with the canals releasing water and keeping seedlings alive. Experts say that the canals, too, would prove ineffective if rains play truant as the rivers would not have enough water to feed the canals.        
	The chief minister said that the government was busy at work to prevent the draught. Sources close to Nitish Kumar and in water resources department revealed that the government was planning to declare several districts as drought hit.         
	It has already demanded a package worth Rs 9,000 crore from the Centre to deal with the state situation.

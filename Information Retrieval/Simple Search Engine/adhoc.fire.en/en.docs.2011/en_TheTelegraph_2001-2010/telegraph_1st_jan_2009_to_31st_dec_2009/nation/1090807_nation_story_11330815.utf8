The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Booty of war: long road of politics
                                                                                                               Booty of war: long road of politics
										      SANKARSHAN THAKUR       Back to Front -10 years of Kargil 5                        Lonely path: A road to LoC from Kargil				                           
	Here is a little glimpse into the man we describe by that disliked anonymous noun called The Enemy: Captain Imtiaz Malik of the Pakistani Armys 165 Mortar Regiment. Capt. Malik, like Capt. Jerry Premraj, perished in the fierce battle over Point 4875 (in Mushkoh) on the night of July 7. If he knew how to fight, he also knew how to love. In his breast pocket was a letter from his wife Samina. It was a crumpled sheet of blue and it was spattered with the dead captains blood. It would seem too indecent an invasion of a dead mans privacy  or a young widows grief  to reveal its contents. Suffices to say that Captain Malik was a man well loved by his dear ones.         
	 From a report in The Telegraph, July 1999              
	No sooner had Capt. Imtiaz Maliks personal effects been spread on the mud floor than the underground Ops HQ in Mushkoh became a divided house. To infantry troops, who had lost men in the battle for Point 4875, the Pakistani soldiers bloodied shirt, letters and signed bank cheques were nothing more than war booty to at once gloat over and vandalise.        
	Look at the b*****d, one among the soldiers who had brought down the remains from the captured Pakistani bunker, hissed, must have thought himself a bit of a Romeo to be carrying his love letters into war. Another was doing a wicked little Rumpelstiltskin dance with the deceased captains bullet-riddled fatigues, circling round and round the little spread of confiscated battle ware: Got him, got him! Love letters and cheques and all, and he was thinking hed harass us and return to his wife and his bank account! S****a!         
	It took a senior officer to put a stop to what was becoming an unseemly celebration. Enough, he sternly said, motioning an end to all of that, This is war, not individual vendetta. Have your victory but dont insult the vanquished. Just consider this man is just like you and me, a soldier fighting under orders for his own country, just as we are, whats the difference? Tomorrow the war will end and you could be ordered to shake hands with his mates.         
	Military discipline ensured immediate return of sobriety to the floor, but the younger ranks continued to rasp and rant behind their seniors back, combustible with rage: These guys have invaded our soil, maimed and killed our men, how do they expect us to be considerate? Nonsense!         
	Pakistan inflames and divides opinion like few other issues do. Then as now, from the frontlines of battlefields to the front benches of Parliament. Its perhaps not a far thing to say Prime Minister Manmohan Singh may have felt a little like that army senior counselling restraint to agitated ranks when he returned from Sharm-el-Sheikh last month to uproarious cries of surrender from the Opposition. Its not easy selling peace with the enemy, but as the Prime Minister keeps adroitly reminding detractors, its tougher  and more costly  remaining constantly at war with him.        
	We cannot choose our neighbours, we have to live with them, Singh has emphasised ad nauseum in advocacy of common sense. We must understand that talking to Pakistan is the best option we have.        
	He has often not left many convinced about his course  leader of the Opposition L.K. Advani, for instance, continues to rail about a sellout at Sharm-el-Sheikh in the face of repeated assurances from the government that New Delhi will not give up its stop exporting terror condition before it agrees to resume comprehensive dialogue.         
	But dialogue about arriving at a stage where comprehensive dialogue can begin, yes. The foreign secretaries and foreign ministers of the two countries are set to meet on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York next month and, who knows, there may even be an opportunity for another Manmohan Singh- Yousaf Raza Gilani summit.         
	In the 10 years that have passed since Kargil, in fact, there have been more peace offensives launched across the cantankerous Indo-Pak frontier than there have been temptations for resort to war. Manmohan Singhs, in fact, is the continuum of a quest begun by his predecessor, Atal Bihari Vajpayee. It is from him that Singh inherited the scalded peace pipe he is trying to stoke alive again.        
	For the many betrayals and setbacks he was subjected to during his tenure at the helm, Vajpayee went equally hard after peace. Perhaps harder because the critics and cynics he had to beat off time and again were mostly located in home camp, in the Sangh parivar.        
	In a sense, the attempt of both Vajpayee then, and Singh now, is to turn Clauswitzs famed maxim  war is merely the continuation of politics by other means  on its head. South Blocks governing principle in relation to Pakistan appears to be: politics is merely the continuation of war by other means. Even if Pakistan is the designated enemy, engage. Forgive the Kargil dagger in the back of the Lahore Declaration. Forget the failures of the much-vaunted Agra Summit. Forge beyond the bloody and audacious provocations of Delhi, Mumbai and Kashmir. Act out of faith rather than fear. Verify, but trust.         
	Its efficacy as an instrument of terminating 60-odd years of mistrust and malevolence hasnt been tested yet, but part of the strategys virtue perhaps lies in that it has been favoured by two individually and ideologically contrasting PMOs. Both Vajpayee and Singh have kept the hawks from chewing the necks off the doves and in doing so both have often appeared lonesome travellers on a long road headed nowhere. But it hasnt been a road they sullied with blood, or with insult to the enemy.         
	Concluded

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP seeks CBI probe 
                                                                                                               BJP seeks CBI probe 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, July 13: Amid a raging political storm over an alleged Rs 4,000-crore mining scam, the BJP today made it clear that it would not take a vigilance inquiry as the answer to their demand for a CBI probe into the Joda (Keonjhar) issue.        
	The matter had first come up in the Assembly on Friday when the Opposition demanded a CBI probe into alleged kickbacks being allowed to a Bihar-based company to carry out illegal mining in the area.         
	BJP national secretary B.S. Punj and K. Somaiya attended a daylong state executive committee meeting at Sahid Bhavan yesterday where the party discussed the future course of action in regards to the Assembly issue.        
	The BJP state executive committee has decided to insist on a CBI probe as the vigilance comes under the administrative purview of the government, said state general secretary and spokesperson Nayan Mohanty talking to The Telegraph today. Only a CBI probe can get to the truth as the government itself is alleged to be a part of the large-scale illegal mining, he said.         
	The vigilance lacks the expertise to inquire into mining operations as it has dealt with few of such cases in 10 years. Besides, the role of vigilance is limited, he added.        
	Mohanty said that the BJP would soon launch a state wide agitation against BJDs inefficiency on all fronts.         
	We will highlight on issues such as the collapse of law due to increasing Naxalite attacks, the Bolangir hooch tragedy and the plight of farmers in the state. The inquiry commission may have submitted its report on the Kandhamal riots, but the government had not tabled it so far. Failure in complying medical council guidelines that had led to MCI recommendation for reduction in MBBS seats at VSS Medical College is another matter that we will highlight upon.        
	The BJP state executive committee will also go in for a state-wide agitation if the government fails to control the rise in prices of essential commodities, Mohanty said.         
	The unprecedented price rise in essential commodities  food items shows that the government has no control of the situation, said the resolution ratified at the meeting. The government has done precious little except for blaming and writing letters to the Centre, the BJP leaders said adding that the recent hike in petrol prices had further aggravated the problem.

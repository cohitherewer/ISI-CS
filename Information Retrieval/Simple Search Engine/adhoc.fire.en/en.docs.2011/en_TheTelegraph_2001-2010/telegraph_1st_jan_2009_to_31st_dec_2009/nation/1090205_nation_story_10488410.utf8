	Srinagar, Feb. 4: Srinagar has taken a big step towards normality with a part of its Central Reserve Police Force being withdrawn amid signs more will follow.        
	Over 30 companies of the force  around 4,000 personnel  are moving out. The withdrawal is part of chief minister Omar Abdullahs plans to put Jammu and Kashmir police at the forefront of law and order duties. The city will have 123 companies, or 15,500 personnel, after the withdrawals. One company has 126 men.        
	CRPF spokesman Prabhakar Tripathi said 30 to 35 companies were being de-inducted, the official term for such withdrawals, in the first phase. A CRPF source said the personnel had been sent out of the state.        
	The CRPF is engaged in counter-insurgency operations and maintaining law and order. Many of the personnel were brought in at the peak of the Amarnath agitation last summer and for Decembers Assembly elections. The city then had a maximum of 153 companies (19,278 personnel) as well as 20,000 from the state police and other paramilitary forces.         
	The CRPF had been criticised for using excessive force to curb the agitation in which dozens died and hundreds were injured. Omar believes putting the state police on the streets will inspire confidence in people. Last month, he deployed the police at all public places in Srinagar and assigned central forces a supporting role. Police sources said the move was aimed at facilitating better police-public relations.         
	Sources said the state government was working on plans for phased CRPF withdrawals from other towns, too.         
	A CRPF source said its top brass was also in favour of the withdrawals so more personnel could be deployed in counter-insurgency operations.        
	The CRPF was first brought into the Valley in the early 1990s but was gradually replaced by the Border Security Force. But, a few years back, the CRPF came back following recommendations of a group of ministers at the Centre to assign specific duties to different paramilitary forces. As a result, the BSF was put mostly on the border.

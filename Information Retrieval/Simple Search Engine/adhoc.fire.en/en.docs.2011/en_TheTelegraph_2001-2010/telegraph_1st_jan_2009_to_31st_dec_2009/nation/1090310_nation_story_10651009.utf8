The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Jaya taunts, Delhi Lanka team flies
                                                                                                               Jaya taunts, Delhi Lanka team flies
          OUR BUREAU                          The medical team prepares to leave for Sri Lanka by an Indian Air Force IL-76 transport aircraft                                  
	March 9: The battle for the Tamil vote is being fought in the air and on the ground in India as casualties mount in the Lankan civil war.        
	An Indian Air Force transport plane ferried a medical team and aid to Lanka today, the ice-breaking mission coming as a virtual repartee to a taunt by Jayalalithaa in Chennai a few hours earlier.        
	The Indian government should have at least sent food, clothing and medicines to the homeless civilians trapped in the war. But Delhi and its ally, the DMK, have failed even in this, Jayalalithaa said while going on a day-long fast demanding a ceasefire in Lanka.        
	She also accused the Centre of helping the Lanka government in the genocide of Tamils by arming the island nations army. The Centre is equally responsible for the genocide of Lankan Tamils as it was supporting the Lankan army with weapons, high-tech equipment and training, she said.        
	Her outburst coincided with reports of fresh bloodletting in Lanka. Officials said troops killed at least 200 LTTE cadres in the north, where a government ship carrying the biggest-ever supplies of essentials, including food items, for displaced civilians was ambushed by the guerrillas.        
	The fighting erupted when the Tamil Tigers made a desperate attempt to breach the defence positions, a Lankan government statement said.        
	Soon after Jayalalithaas swipe, the Centre announced a medical team had set out for Lanka  the first such direct initiative after the peace-keeping mission of 1987. The Telegraph had reported last week that the foreign ministry had cleared the medical mission.        
	The team carried 25 tonnes of medical aid by an IL-76 transport aircraft. Another trip conveying 25 tonnes of medical aid and medical personnel is scheduled for tomorrow, an Indian government statement said in Delhi.        
	Jayalalithaa was, however, silent on the Tamil Tigers. Observers said she did not want to be seen giving the rebels importance while focusing on civilians, though she dropped hints she was against the LTTEs armed resistance.        
	She left little doubt her party would rake up the issue in the run-up to the general election.         
	Jayalalithaa made a personal donation of Rs 5 lakh to a relief fund floated by the ADMK for the Lankan Tamils.

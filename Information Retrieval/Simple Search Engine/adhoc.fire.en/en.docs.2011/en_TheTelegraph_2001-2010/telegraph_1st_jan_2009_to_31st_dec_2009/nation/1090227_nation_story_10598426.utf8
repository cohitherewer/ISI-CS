The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cell switch with same number
                                                                                                               Cell switch with same number
          JAYATI GHOSE                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 26: Cellphone users will soon be able to change service providers without having to change their numbers.         
	The government is set to announce the names of two operators who will get mobile number portability (MNP) licence to set up clearing houses that will allow transfer of cellphone numbers from one service provider to another.        
	Successful bidders for grant of MNP service licences will be announced by March 5. They will also be issued letters of intent by next week, an official said.         
	US-based firms Telcordia and Syniverse Technologies are tipped to be frontrunners in the race for the licence, sources said. The other bidders include NeuStar, GTL, Tech Mahindra, Tekelec Systems, IBC, and CDoT.        
	The successful bidders will set up a number portability database, which will have the numbers of all cellphone users. Service providers will then link their networks to that of the clearing house administrator to allow them access to the database.         
	Each clearing house administrator will manage and implement portability of cellphone numbers in 11 of the 22 telecom circles.         
	Calcutta, Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai will be covered in the first phase that will be completed by August.        
	Successful bidders will have to invest up to Rs 100 crore to set up clearing houses to allow the MNP to take place, the official said.         
	Number portability will allow customers to freely move to any operator of their choice and thus derive the full benefit of the competition through low tariff, high quality of service, wide coverage and enhanced features offered by particular service providers.        
	The main reason customers now do not switch service providers, even when they want to, is that they would have to change the phone number.        
	Number portability could help reduce call tariff and improve call clarity as providers compete to keep customers.         
	Cellphone users will have to pay a fee each time they switch the provider.

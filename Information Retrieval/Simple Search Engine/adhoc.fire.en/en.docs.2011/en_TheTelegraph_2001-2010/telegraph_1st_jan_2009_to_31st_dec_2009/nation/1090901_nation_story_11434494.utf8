The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Special choco treats take Orissa market by storm
                                                                                                               Special choco treats take Orissa market by storm
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          The wrapped product ready for the market                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 31: Got a sweet tooth, then try something special, such as Chocolos.        
	For those uninitiated, this special brand of chocolates is being made by a handful of mentally challenged students of Open Learning Systems, a non-government organisation. A brainchild of Kasturi Mohapatra, the NGO head, the programme begun in March 2009.         
	Already the brand has won a steady fan following. Firms such as Vodafone, Aircel, Tata Teleservices, Paradeep Port Company Limited and Dhamra Port Company Limited have relished the sweets and the tempting treats have made their way to food and gift marts in the capital city.        
	Before production began, students received their training in two batches from a Hyderabad-based expert at the training school. These two batches in turn trained their batch mates. It (training) was a difficult task, but most of our students are proficient in their tasks now, said special instructor Sujata Patnaik. Barring the measurement part, our students do almost every other task on their own. From preparing the chocolates, to the packaging and the storing, she said.        
	About 8kg of chocolate is produced for sale everyday, said Sagarika Sahoo, another special instructor said. The goodies are available in cashew, almond, black, marble, mint, biscuit and wafer flavours and are priced between Rs 10 and Rs 12 per piece.         
	We also have a car pool that picks up the students up from their homes as we found out that some of the parents dont have the time for their children. They learn their tasks here and at the end of the day they are dropped off, said Sahoo.         
	Apart from chocolate making, training in bamboo craft and other handicraft items are also imparted at the school. The earning from the sales go to a common fund and the students have so far purchased two wheelchairs, calculators and crayons for themselves.        
	Meanwhile, Reach Out, a group constituting 10 students of Xaviers Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar, have offered to help in the marketing of the chocolates. We did approach corporate organisations and spoke to them about the product and the cause, said Asit Agarwal, a team member.         
	Though now the sales are limited, Open Learning System plans to market the chocolates aggressively if sales pick up, said course co-ordinator Bidyut Singhdeo.

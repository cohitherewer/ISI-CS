The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Weak inherits mighty foes   BJP unleashes full firepower 
                                                                                                               Weak inherits mighty foes
   BJP unleashes full firepower           SANJAY K. JHA                   
	New Delhi, March 24: The BJP today deployed all its firepower to take on a person its leader described as the weakest Prime Minister.        
	Advani, the BJPs prime ministerial candidate, did some heavy shelling himself at a rally in Mathura, claiming that he had not seen a weaker Prime Minister in Independent India.        
	The party spokespersons fired salvos from all corners of Delhi.        
	Today, in a stinging attack, Manmohan said Advani had played a prominent role in the Babri mosque demolition. Then he asked: What else has he done to the contribution of national welfare?        
	Retorting, Advani said: It is wrong to describe this as the Manmohan Singh government. He doesnt run the government. He sends a minister to get clearance from Sonia Gandhi on every issue. This is Sonias government.                  Advani at the Mathura rally. (AFP)       
	Advani said it was extremely unfortunate that the importance of 7 Race Course Road  the official residence of the Prime Minister  had completely diminished and 10 Janpath, Sonias residence, had become the power centre. A weak Prime Minister lowers Indias prestige in the comity of nations. People get aggressive against India.        
	But the leader of Opposition chose not to lock horns with Manmohan over specifics. He did not get into the debate over his contribution to nation-building, but instead hailed the vision and contributions of Charan Singh, Deen Dayal Upadhyay and Atal Bihari Vajpayee.         
	He mentioned the Pokhran nuclear test to buttress the BJPs claim of offering a strong leadership.        
	BJP general secretary Arun Jaitley and party chief Rajnath Singh too harped the weak PM tune.         
	Venkaiah Naidu said Advani did not need certificates from Manmohan who helplessly presided over a corrupt cabinet.                     
	Ravi Shankar Prasad questioned the moral authority of a person who had become the Prime Minister by accident to question Advanis credentials.        
	The BJP is now planning to scale up the attack on the Prime Minister.         
	But the party will find it difficult to defend Advani on the Jinnah row, which Manmohan sought to revive in a deft political move.         
	It will also have to come up with a structured response to counter the propaganda about Advanis track record as home minister and his role in the demolition of the Babri mosque.        
	Another issue that the Prime Minister sought to raise to corner the BJP was communalism that yet again came to the fore through the Varun Gandhi controversy.         
	On this, the BJP is planning a two-prong approach. While Advani will avoid getting embroiled in it, other leaders including Rajnath will move aggressive with the objective of appealing to the core Hindutva constituency.         
	The BJP is least worried about communal-secular debate as it helps the party galvanise its cadre without much effort.

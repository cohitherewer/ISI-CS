                                                                                                               Sleep link to road accidents
                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 14 (PTI): Over 50 per cent of people who suffered brain injuries in road accidents did not get proper sleep the night before, a study conducted by AIIMS has found.        
	The study found that more than 50 per cent of the people who met with accidents and had minor head injuries were suffering from sleep deprivation. Incidentally, such people had not slept the night before the accident, P. Sarat Chandra, associate professor, department of neurosurgery at AIIMS, said.        
	Lack of sleep leads to loss of concentration which results in higher incidence of road accidents, even in the case of professional drivers, Chandra said.        
	The study, by the Jai Prakash Narain Apex Trauma Centre of AIIMS, was conducted on 380 patients, who suffered minor head injuries in accidents between 2007 and 2009.        
	Patients with history of drug abuse or alcohol addiction prior to the accident were excluded.         
	The victims, interviewed immediately after the accident as they have a tendency to forget, said they remembered they had dozed off when the accident took place, Chandra said.        
	Manjari Tripathy, another researcher involved in the study, said: The drivers fault has led to many road accidents. Most of those who met with accidents were deprived of adequate sleep. They were in the age category of 20-30 years.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Obama rules out J amp;K role
                                                                                                               Obama rules out J amp;K role
                            
	Washington, June 20 (PTI): President Barack Obama has ruled out American mediation in the Kashmir issue, saying dialogue was the best way to reduce tension between India and Pakistan.        
	I believe that there are opportunities, maybe not starting with Kashmir but starting with other issues, that Pakistan and India can be in a dialogue together and over time try to reduce tensions and find areas of common interest, Obama told Pakistans Dawn TV in an interview.         
	He was replying to a question on why his administration had been silent on Kashmir after he had initially mentioned it. Well, I dont think that we have been silent on the fact that India is a great friend of the United States and Pakistan is a great friend of the United States, and it always grieves us to see friends fighting. And we cant dictate to Pakistan or India how they should resolve their differences, but we know that both countries would prosper if those differences are resolved.         
	Ruling out US mediation, he said: We want to be helpful in that process, but I dont think its appropriate for us to be the mediators in that process.        
	 I think that this is something that the Pakistanis and Indians can take leadership on.        
	On being asked if he had asked India to resume dialogue with Pakistan, Obama said: Well, what we have said is that we think that all of South Asia would benefit by reduced tensions between India and Pakistan.         
	US undersecretary of state for political affairs William Burns had told Singh the US was for talks between India and Pakistan, on a recent trip to India.         
	I think that dialogue is the best way to reduce tensions. And so, you know, were hopeful that Prime Minister Singh and (Pakistan) President (Asif Ali) Zardari  they recently had an opportunity to meet briefly. It wasnt an extensive conversation but it was the start of what may end up being more productive conversations in the future, Obama said.

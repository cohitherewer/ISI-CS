	 Shahbaz Rajput, a lawyer representing some of the accused, said that judge Baqir Ali Rana had adjourned the case till September 5 for the completion of some formalities. Jamil Ahmed, a Lashkar-e-Toiba suspect arrested earlier this month for allegedly facilitating the Mumbai attacks, was also produced in the court.

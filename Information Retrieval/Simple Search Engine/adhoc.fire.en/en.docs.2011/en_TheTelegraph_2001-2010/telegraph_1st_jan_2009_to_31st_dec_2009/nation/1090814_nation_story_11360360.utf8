The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Profit ok, not profiteer
                                                                                                               Profit ok, not profiteer
  - Private schools can set fee for reasonable return: SC        SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                                    
	New Delhi, Aug. 13: The Supreme Court has held that private, unaided schools cannot profiteer but that wont preclude them from earning reasonable profits.        
	The authorities of all schools, particularly unaided ones, may lay down their own fee criteria but these will be subject to regulations by state education authorities, the apex court said.        
	Imposition of regulation, however, is only permissible for the purpose of exercising control over profiteering and not (over) earning of profit, which would include reasonable return on investment made, a two-judge bench ruled earlier this week.        
	Citing an earlier judgment, the court said the rights of such institutions included the right to frame a reasonable fee structure.        
	There can be a reasonable revenue surplus, which may be generated by the institution for development of education and expansion.         
	The court said regulatory measures could be framed to ensure the maintenance of proper academic standards, atmosphere and infrastructure (including qualified staff) and prevention of malpractice. But fixing a rigid fee structure, nomination of teachers and staff, or of students, will be unacceptable restrictions.        
	The ruling came on an appeal by the Action Committee of Unaided Private Schools, representing institutions in the capital, against a high court order upholding a Delhi government rule that barred fund transfers from a school to the society or from one school to another. The apex court struck down the regulations.        
	State regulation should be minimal to maintain fairness and transparency in admission procedure and to check exploitation of students by charging exorbitant money or capitation fee.        
	The apex court cited its judgment in the TMA Pai Foundation case to affirm that a citizens right to set up educational institutions was a fundamental right. However, the right of minorities to set up institutions was not absolute and subject to regulations.        
	In case of unaided minority institutions, government control should be minimum, it said. The court said their fees couldnt be regulated but added a rider: no capitation fee.        
	The court also cited the Pai judgment to say unaided professional institutions should be given greater autonomy in admission procedure and fees.        
	A parents body had filed a writ petition against 30 unaided schools seeking steps to regulate their admissions.

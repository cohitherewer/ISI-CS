The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tax cuts and cheap rice
                                                                                                               Tax cuts and cheap rice
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 3: The BJP manifesto woos the middle class and the poor by promising to lower taxes and interest rates, waive farm loans and provide rice or wheat to the poor at Rs 2 a kg.        
	Analysts, however, said the populist measures, if implemented, would have a devastating impact on the countrys fiscal deficit, estimated to be above 10 per cent.        
	The BJP has pledged to exempt from income tax those earning up to Rs 3 lakh, abolish the fringe-benefit tax, provide incentives for saving, and crack down on black money. These sops, the party hopes, will win over the urban middle class at a time of economic slowdown.        
	It has also promised to waive farm loans, give new loans at a maximum 4 per cent interest, and cut housing interest rates. All personnel of the army, air force and navy, as also paramilitary forces, will be exempt from paying income tax on their salaries and perquisites, it says.        
	This is a major, and perhaps controversial, announcement that may influence a huge segment of voters. The BJP also promised a separate pay commission for the forces and upheld the principle of one-rank, one-pension.        
	The manifesto is populist. One only hopes it does not affect the grim fiscal situation further. The farm loan waivers, if carried out, would result in a tendency to not pay back, which is worrying, said D.K. Joshi, principal economist with rating agency Crisil.        
	According to the manifesto, a BJP-led government would build one million houses for the poor every year, boosting the slowing real estate sector. It will cut interest on housing loans, providing a cushion from the global financial crisis.        
	If the BJP is voted to power, the manifesto said, it would build 25-20km of new highways every day and link all villages with over 500 people by all-weather roads, thus also creating employment.        
	The BJP said it would work towards generating 1.2 crore new IT-enabled jobs in rural areas, but would oppose foreign investment in retail, a sector that is dominated by mom-and-pop stores and is the second-largest employer after agriculture with nearly four crore workers.        
	Accusing the UPA regime of mismanaging the national economy, the BJP said it would put in place a low-tax, low-interest regime so that people have more money and their purchasing power increases, which in turn will serve as an impetus for the economy.        
	CST (central sales tax) will be abolished and GST (goods and services tax) will be rationalised between 12 and 14 per cent; FBT (fringe-benefit tax) will go. The ESOPS (employee stock ownership plan) and MAT (minimum alternative tax) regime will be rationalised and made equitable, the manifesto said.        
	To provide a fillip to the tourism sector, the party said it would identify 50 destinations and develop infrastructure and connectivity, doubling foreign arrivals in five years and generating employment in the hospitality industry.        
	To prevent stock scams and scandals like the one involving Satyam, the manifesto promised watertight monitoring of regulatory bodies.

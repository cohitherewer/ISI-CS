The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Aligarh probe panel caught in own fight
                                                                                                               Aligarh probe panel caught in own fight
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 24: The first ever presidential enquiry into allegations surrounding Aligarh Muslim University is threatening to morph into a duel between the probe members, delaying any resolution and forcing education minister Kapil Sibal to intervene.         
	Human resource development minister Sibal will call a meeting with the two members of the probe panel to resolve differences that are delaying the enquiry at the politically sensitive university, top government officials said.        
	The panel of Justice Fakhruddin, retired judge from the Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh high courts, and Akbar Hameed Jung, a retired Indian Audits and Accounts Service officer, had to submit its final report by October 28.        
	But the team has managed to conduct just two hearings since its appointment by the HRD ministry in late July and will certainly need more time to complete its work, sources associated with the probe said.        
	The outcome of the probe  ordered by the President in her capacity as visitor (final administrative head) of the institution  is considered by most in the Aligarh university community as critical to its future.         
	The probe is mandated to investigate a slew of corruption allegations against the vice-chancellor, P.K. Abdul Azis and other administrators, and a set of counter charges levelled against the initial complainants.        
	Minutes of the two hearings held so far reveal that the probe has been mired from the start in personal allegations levelled by both sides and in a bitter debate revolving around the university representative.         
	But the probe is now stuck because Jung and Fakhruddin are unable to decide on the legitimacy of the appointment of Ejaz Maqbool, a Supreme Court lawyer representing the university in the enquiry.        
	Eight university executive council members  including former Congress MP Waseem Ahmad  opposed Maqbools appointment as the institutions representative, calling it illegal, the minutes show.         
	As Maqbool was appointed solely by the vice-chancellor, he could represent only the VC and not the university  defined to also include executive council members  they argued. Only the Aligarh university court  the highest governing body  can legally appoint the universitys representative before the fact-finding team, they argued.         
	Jung then also questioned the manner in which Maqbool was appointed. He asked why the VC was refraining from calling a meeting of the university court to ratify Maqbools appointment, the minutes show.         
	Jung referred to allegations that the VC and the registrar used campus funds to pay their income tax, questioning how Maqbool would represent the university when its interests were at variance with those of the VC.         
	Fakhruddin, however, indicated that according to him the questions over Maqbools appointment are unnecessary, the minutes show.         
	The judge even suggested that Zafaryab Jeelani, one of the eight council members opposed to the VC, re-read the section of the Aligarh Muslim University Act under which the enquiry was ordered.         
	Maqbool  supported by two faculty members who are also in the council but support the VC  argued that the probe panel was not empowered to decide on the legality of the varsity representatives appointment.        
	The eight council members who challenged Maqbools appointment were the original complainants against the VC along with members of the non-teaching staff and the AMU Old Boys Association. They had first approached former HRD minister Arjun Singh last year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pawar tiff on Kalmadi turf
                                                                                                               Pawar tiff on Kalmadi turf
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI IN PUNE                          Kalmadi: Safe?                                  
	Small Pawars rarely have a chance in front of Big Pawars.         
	Thats the hope driving the campaign of Indias Olympic chief Suresh Kalmadi, in a contest he started as favourite only to be pulled back by a man expected to play the role of a teammate.         
	With Sonia Gandhi dropping by in the city on Monday to seek votes for Kalmadi, Congress bikers drove across Pune chanting the party presidents name since early morning.         
	But at the jahir sabha (massive rally) she addressed, it was the man seated with her on the dais who was the focus of attention for tense Congress worker Vinod Amre.         
	When Sharad Pawar got up and unequivocally supported Kalmadi, Amre relaxed and whispered: Now no one can defeat Kalmadi.         
	The key to Kalmadis chances of repeating his 2004 win in the Lok Sabha polls is best summed up by a hoarding hanging outside the first floor of the Congress Bhawan, the party headquarters here.         
	Hi dosti tutaichi nhaye (this friendship will not break), says the hoarding. Beneath, the Congress and NCP election symbols are shown shaking hands.         
	On every campaign poster, placard or painting, Sharad Pawar enjoys pride of prominence alongside Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Sonia.         
	Elsewhere in the state too, the three leaders share most posters of the Congress-NCP alliance, but greater prominence is given to the leader of the party whose candidate is contesting from that particular seat.         
	The Congress cannot win in Pune without (Sharad) Pawar, accepted a senior leader at the Congress headquarters. The support Pawar continues to enjoy in large pockets here is massive.         
	His importance to the alliances chances of winning here is not lost on Sharad Pawar, who has spent more time here garnering support for the Indian Olympic Association chief than he has for any other Congress candidate.         
	He needed to, for not long ago, another Pawar, the union ministers nephew Ajit, was threatening to lock down the National Congress Partys machinery to prevent it from supporting Kalmadi.         
	Ajit, a minister in the Maharashtra government, never publicly asked party workers to abstain from supporting Kalmadi, but through quiet, behind-the-scenes manoeuvres, managed to raise doubts about the NCPs commitment to the coalition here.         
	The nephew stayed away from the high profile launch of Kalmadis campaign earlier this month, and the strain in relations between the Congress and the NCP began to tell on the uncle.         
	It took Sharad Pawars threat to withdraw from the Madha seat where he is contesting under party pressure  he wanted to join the Rajya Sabha  to kickstart the NCP machinerys support for Kalmadi.         
	And on Monday, at the NCPs city headquarters, workers were busy discussing campaign strategies before polling.         
	Pawar saab (a reference to Sharad Pawar) has made it clear that we must support Kalmadi. His is the final word for us. Ajit is important to us, but what is a mouse in front of an elephant, a party worker asked, as he dusted off election pamphlets.         
	But the bumpy history of the relationship Sharad Pawar shares with Kalmadi means that the man who brought India the 2010 Commonwealth Games can never take the Pune seat for granted, his aides accept.         
	It is a relationship that Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray has tried to use while campaigning for his party candidate Ranjit Shirole to suggest opportunism on the part of Sharad Pawar and Kalmadi. The BJP candidate, Anil Shirole, is Kalmadis principal challenger.         
	It was under Sharad Pawars tutelage  when he was still in the Congress  that Kalmadi took his first major political steps, but the two fell out around the time Sharad Pawar quit to start the NCP in 1999.         
	Each hurled allegations at the other over the next five years, before the need for Sharad Pawars support forced Kalmadi to eat humble pie. He renewed ties with his former mentor in a pact aided by industrialist Rahul Bajaj, a friend to both.         
	So it is natural for our workers to closely follow every word that both the senior Pawar and his nephew speak about Kalmadi. Thankfully, the Pawar that matters the most is with us at the moment, a Kalmadi aide said.         
	 Pune goes to the polls on April 23

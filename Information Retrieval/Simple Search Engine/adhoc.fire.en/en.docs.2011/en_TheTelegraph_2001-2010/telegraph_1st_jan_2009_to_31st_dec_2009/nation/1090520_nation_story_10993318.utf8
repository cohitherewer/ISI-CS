        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Rahul leaves after the Congress parliamentary party meeting on Tuesday. Asked whether he would join the government, the Amethi MP quipped: I have made up my mind and you will shortly come to know. (PTI)                                              
	New Delhi, May 19: Sonia Gandhi today formally set Manmohan Singh on his way to a second term as Prime Minister, facilitating his election as Congress parliamentary party leader.        
	His record of the past five years speaks for itself and we look forward to his leadership in the coming years, Sonia, re-elected CPP chairperson, told party MPs in Parliaments Central Hall.        
	His dignified, determined and effective leadership of the government has been an inspiration for us all and has received overwhelming approval from the people of the country, she added.        
	It was at this venue that Sonia had, on May 18 five years ago, rejected her partys call to take over as Prime Minister after the Congresss surprise victory over the BJP. Today, she stressed the importance of party work in a pep talk to those who lost the election.        
	The party is much more than membership of Parliament or the legislatures. There is important work to be done by one and all. I have no doubt that if this work is taken well and truly in hand, we will emerge even stronger in the future, she said.        
	Sonias remarks came amid speculation that her son Rahul Gandhi might take her lead and choose organisational work over joining the government.        
	The Amethi MP was non-committal, telling journalists: I have made up my mind and you will shortly come to know.        
	The familiar cry of Rahul as PM was not raised at the CPP meeting, sources said. The media had been kept out, except for a photo-op, because the party had feared its eager beavers might make the Rahul pitch and end up embarrassing Sonia and Singh.        
	According to a printed text given to the media, Sonia told the meeting: As party members, whether occupying government office or not, whether having a position in the organisation or not, we have a duty to remain disciplined and united, putting party before self. As individuals, we have an obligation to project values of integrity and character.        
	Sonia urged her MPs to honour the voters mandate in the spirit in which it was given. The peoples verdict tells us that above all, they crave honest and capable governance and decency in public life, she said.        
	We have seen that notions such as anti-incumbency and (the) pulls and pressures from caste or region can be overcome by dedication and real work. This is what now awaits us. As parliamentarians, we have a call to strengthen our links and dialogue with those whom we serve.        
	Sonia, whose party has higher numbers in Parliament this time as well as unconditional support from several regional groups, asked Congress MPs to avoid fractious politics and work with members from all parties.        
	She asked them to strive at restoring the decorum of political discourse and raising Parliament once again to a pre-eminent forum of dignified debate and decision-making.        
	Singh spoke of how the youth had gravitated hugely towards the Congress inspired by the leadership of Rahul Gandhi.

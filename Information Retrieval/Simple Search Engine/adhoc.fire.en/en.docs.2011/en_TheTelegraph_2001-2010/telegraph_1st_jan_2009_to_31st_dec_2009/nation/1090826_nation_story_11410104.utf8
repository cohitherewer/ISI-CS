The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PM sticks to peace push with Pak
                                                                                                               PM sticks to peace push with Pak
  - India must strive to resolve differences with neighbours through negotiations, says Singh        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                     
	New Delhi, Aug. 25: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh indicated today that his government was inclined to press on with the search for peace with Pakistan despite the fact that Islamabads actions against the terror network hadnt nearly measured up to New Delhis expectations, or even Pakistani promises.         
	Addressing a conference of Indian heads of mission today, the Prime Minister spoke of Indias determination to combat terror with full vigour but also said that India must strive to engage neighbours constructively and resolve differences through peaceful means and negotiations.         
	This is probably a signal that scheduled meetings bet-ween Indian and Pakistani foreign secretaries and foreign ministers on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly next month will go ahead despite the fact that there has been little evidence of the Pakistani establishment moving to dismantle the terror network since the Sharm-el-Sheikh joint statement.         
	There is known to be some unease among Indias top diplomats, currently holding their annual conference here, over the joint statement, especi-ally the inclusion of Pakistani concerns over Balochistan, and its implications.         
	But sources indicated that the Prime Minister was not willing to opt out of the negotiations option in a hurry.         
	A senior official said: As the Prime Minister has repeatedly said, we cannot choose our neighbours and the only way to proceed in relations with Pakistan is talks. At the same time, as his recent warning over increased infiltration from the Pakistani side at the chief ministers conference on internal security suggested, the government has not taken its eye off the terror threat and will press Pakistan consistently on it.         
	Speaking to assembled diplomats, the Prime Minister also emphasised the integral link of Indias foreign policy with domestic policies, particularly economic policy.         
	He noted that the countrys foreign policy should be aimed at addressing the challenges of mass poverty, ignorance and disease in the country, which were the primary concern of the Indian state and polity.         
	He said, in this context, that despite the global economic slowdown, the Indian economy was still the second fastest growing economy in the world.         
	Prime Minister Singh also identified three pillars of Indias global engagement  sustaining capital inflows to supplement domestic investment efforts, the need to take advantage of rapid scientific and technological developments in the world which provide an opportunity for India to propel its technological leap, and the need to ensure that the countrys growth is not constrained by scarcity of natural resources.

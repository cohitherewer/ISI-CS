                                                                                                               Minister defends arms permit
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Jan. 16: State minister Jamshed Ashraf today claimed that he had surrendered his arms licence issued by the Raigad police in Maharashtra after winning the last Assembly election in Bihars Ballia.        
	Raj Thackeray-led Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) activist Atul Bhagat yesterday filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in Bombay High Court alleging that Ashraf procured the arms licence from Nhava-Sheva police station in Uran Taluka of Raigad district.        
	The PIL said that being a resident and minister of Bihar, Ashraf could not have legally obtained licence from the Maharashtra government, praying the court for appropriate action against Ashraf.        
	However, Ashraf told The Telegraph: We have been living in Maharashtra for the past 30 years. I legally got the licence long ago on the basis of my residence and clean records with the police there.        
	Ashraf added that he had come to contest the Assembly election from his native Ballia constituency in 2005 polls and won the seat. I returned the licence to Nhava-Sheva police station concerned in Maharashtra after winning the poll, he said, adding: Bhagat is an unpopular figure in Mumbai and has changed six parties in the past year. He lodged the PIL against me just to gain some cheap popularity.        
	Ashraf said that he had already briefed his lawyer about the matter.

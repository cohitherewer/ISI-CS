	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 31: Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan today asked panchayati raj institutions to function transparently and also assist in organising social audits for effective implementation of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS).        
	Of course the MGNREGS is one of the most progressive social welfare measures undertaken in our country in recent years. However, at the present juncture, its potential can only be described as partially fulfilled, Justice Balakrishnan observed while inaugurating a seminar, Role of panchayati raj institutions in consumer movement and implementation of NREGA, here today.        
	Though there had been several favourable reports about its success in limiting distress migration in some districts, several systemic problems found in it could only be addressed through persistent efforts of implementing agencies, civil society organisations as well as the legal system, he said.        
	The primary problem was that of corruption and lack of transparency in maintaining muster rolls and records of payment of wages. The unholy nexus between local contractors and government officials was further complicated by social realities, such as the exploitation of illiterate workers, noted Justice Balakrishnan.        
	 It is, therefore, important for individuals to be aware of their entitlements under the scheme and also collectively participate in the social audits concerned with the implementation of the same, he stressed.        
	In this context, pnachayati raj institutions could aid legal service authorities by organising social audits through public hearings, which involved all residents of a village concerned, he said. The larger challenge of course is to ensure that panchayati raj institutions themselves come to function in a transparent manner, while being accountable to different sections of the society, said Justice Balakrishnan.        
	Noting that the consumer dispute redressal forums were largely confined to urban centres, he stressed on the need for proactive measures to spread awareness about these remedies in the rural areas.        
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik announced that the state government would soon launch a toll-free grievance redressal mechanism for targeted public distribution system beneficiaries.         
	Steps had also been taken to start a state consumer helpline across the state, he added.                    
	We are also in the process of engaging one ombudsman in each district to listen to the grievances of job-seekers and redress them effectively under the MGNREGS, he added.

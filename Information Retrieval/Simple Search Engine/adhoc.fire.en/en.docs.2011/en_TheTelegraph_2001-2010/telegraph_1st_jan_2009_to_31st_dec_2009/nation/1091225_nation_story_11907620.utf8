The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Panel plan draws scorn
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Panel plan draws scorn
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Dec. 24: The Centre today floated the possibility of a second states reorganisation commission but the Telangana lobby rejected the plan as the resignation rush spread to MPs and Andhra ministers.        
	Violence also flared up during the Telangana bandh, though statehood spearhead Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) announced it was calling off the 48-hour shutdown because of Christmas.         
	But TRS chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao dismissed the state panel plan as an insult. It is an insult to us. The first SRC (state panel) had recommended the formation of Telangana. Then where is the question of a second SRC now? he told reporters in Hyderabad.        
	In Delhi, Sonia Gandhis political secretary Ahmed Patel told the Telangana MPs  11 of the 12 from the region, barring Union minister Jaipal Reddy  who had faxed their resignations to the Congress president that yesterdays statement by the Centre hadnt altered the basic principle behind the plan to create Telangana. The Centre had said there was a need for wide-ranging consultations. Sources said Patel told the MPs that the Centre would soon come up with a time frame for the consultations and that there was no question of postponing a decision indefinitely.        
	The government has already committed a grave mistake after being misled by Andhra MPs (not from the Telanagana region) who are solely driven by their business interests. It should plan carefully now, one MP warned.        
	In Hyderabad, IT and youth affairs minister K. Venkat Reddy tendered his resignation over what he said was the unconvincing approach of the Congress party and the Centre on Telangana. He said the 12 other ministers from Telangana wanted to quit too, but were being persuaded by chief minister K. Rosaiah to stay on. If all of you go, I will not be far behind, Reddy quoted Rosaiah as telling him.        
	The others were locked in meetings at minister D.K. Arunas home to decide their future course of action amid signs that they would step down any time.         
	Telangana supporters attacked government offices and buses and forced educational institutions, banks and markets to remain shut in the Telangana region, including Hyderabad.        
	Rao said tomorrows bandh was being put on hold in view of the requests from the Christian community. We will be happy if they have Jai Telangana cakes.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 16: Fifty-three years ago, Orissa State Financial Corporation had been set up to extend financial assistance for establishing new small and medium-scale industrial units as well as rehabilitating sick ones. However, it itself turned sick in the long run after assisting more than 28,000 micro, small and medium enterprises in Orissa and stopped lending in 2003.         
	After remaining defunct for six years, it has now got a new lease of life with the support of the state government and Small Industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi).         
	Sidbi has agreed to waive 50 per cent interest amounting to Rs 48.09 crore and reduced interest rate from 11.70 per cent to 7.5 per cent per annum on an outstanding loan of Rs 140 crore.         
	It also agreed to provide refinance for development of micro, small and medium enterprise sectors, which had been hit since the OFSC itself turned sick.        
	An MoU to this effect was signed between Sidbi, the state government and OSFC here today in presence of chief minister Naveen Patnaik.

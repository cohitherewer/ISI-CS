The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | A Darjeeling riddle 
                                                                                                               A Darjeeling riddle 
          VIVEK CHHETRI                              
	Darjeeling, Aug. 19: Darjeeling, which sent Jaswant Singh to the Lok Sabha, has a riddle symptomatic of the monsoon season: has it been hit by an unexpected landslide or has a new road been opened?        
	The news of the Darjeeling MPs expulsion initially hit the hills like a calamity, especially since the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha was saying as recently as yesterday that all landslides on the road to Gorkhaland had been removed.        
	The Morcha is now wondering aloud whether the BJP will dump Gorkhaland, which the national party mentioned in its election manifesto, in the absence of Jaswant.         
	But others felt that unshackled from the BJP, Jaswant would now be more free to reach out to other political formations and build a larger consensus on statehood.         
	Jaswant himself sought to keep Darjeelings hopes afloat, telling news channel CNN-IBN: I am no longer bound to a party but I have a responsibility towards Darjeeling and the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha. With them I shall consult and see how they react. This is a beginning of a new road.        
	Buoyed after the tripartite talks in Delhi where it was decided that the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC) would be scrapped and the Sixth Schedule status bill for the hills dropped, the Morcha leadership had been banking on Jaswant Gorkha to give the final push to its statehood cause.        
	Singh was our window to Gorkhaland, admitted a Morcha leader. He had upheld our demand and won from here riding on our support. We could pressure him to bring our issue to the national stage.        
	Still sure that Jaswant will continue to do so, he wondered just how effective he would be.        
	Uncertainty has also crept in about the BJPs commitment to the cause of Gorkhaland. We hope the BJP doesnt backtrack on its commitment to Gorkhaland, said Harka Bahadur Chhetri, the Morcha publicity secretary who had yesterday told a gathering in Kalimpong all the landslides had been removed from the road to Gorkhaland.        
	 We have not struck a deal (for support to Gorkhaland) with any individual, Chhetri said. The BJP had collectively decided to support us.        
	But Madan Tamang, the leader of another Gorkha organisation, said: It looks like the votes from Darjeeling have gone into the dustbin.

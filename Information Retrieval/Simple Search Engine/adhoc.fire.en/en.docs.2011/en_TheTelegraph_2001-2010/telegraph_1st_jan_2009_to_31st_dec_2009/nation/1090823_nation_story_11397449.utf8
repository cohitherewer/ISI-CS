          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jaipur, Aug. 22: A Congress MLA has been accused of enticing underage schoolchildren to donate blood at a camp held to mark Rajiv Gandhis birth anniversary, embarrassing the party.        
	One of the students, 16-year-old Anil Sharma, collapsed and had to be referred to the Sawai Man Singh Hospital in Jaipur. Three others also fell ill but recovered quickly.        
	Only those aged 18 or more can donate blood but MLA Bhagwan Sahai Saini allegedly lured 50-60 students aged 15 to 16 into the act. Residents said the camp had been off to a poor start with the organisers failing to attract enough donors.        
	The camp was organised on August 20 at Chomu, about 60km from here, near a government higher secondary school and a government hospital.        
	The Opposition BJP called a bandh today in the area. It alleged that Saini had gone to the school and promised certificates to the students  which he said would help them in their career  besides money and food if they donated blood.        
	Om Prakash, the father of Anil Sharma, the student who was hospitalised, said his son had recovered from jaundice two months ago and had informed the organisers.        
	Still, he alleged, the 16-year-old was asked to donate blood. His age was recorded as 19 on the donor card.        
	Prakash alleged that the school authorities were aware that underage students were being made to donate blood but did nothing. The school authorities say they had no idea what was going on at the camp.        
	Ramji Lal Sharma, a former BJP legislator from Chomu, said Anil had recovered but had to be re-admitted today to the Sawai Man Singh Hospital after his condition worsened again.        
	Chomu resident Rajesh Kalra said Saini, the Congress MLA, was present when the students came to donate blood at the camp.         
	Saini denied he had lured students with promises of certificates. He said the camp was held under the supervision of trained medical practitioners.        
	He pinned the blame on the doctors, saying they should not have allowed minors to donate blood, and accused the BJP of conspiring to defame him.        
	The BJP has demanded a judicial inquiry, saying the administrative probe ordered by the Jaipur collector was not enough.        
	The party alleged that the police had failed to lodge a first information report against the school authorities and the camps organisers.        
	Congress leaders organise various programmes around the country every August 20, including blood donation camps, to mark Rajivs birth anniversary.

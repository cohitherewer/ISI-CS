The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ulfa gaffe hits Bangla team plane
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Ulfa gaffe hits Bangla team plane
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                
	New Delhi, Dec. 5: A mock air-safety drill turned into a huge faux pas today with the call from Barua, Delhi chief of Ulfa delaying a Dhaka-bound Jet Airways flight carrying five top Bangladesh government officials, sources said.        
	It is not known if the Bangladesh delegation was the one led by home secretary Abdus Sobhan Sikder, which included the BDRs deputy director-general, Mohammad Obaidul Hoque, and was scheduled to leave today.        
	Mock security drills are meant to test airports preparedness to tackle emergencies, but the choice of flight was a bloomer, especially just a fortnight before Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina visits India.        
	What made the threat call doubly effective  and ironical  was the mention of Ulfa, since the Hasina government recently handed over top leaders of the outfit to India in a goodwill gesture.        
	The flight was to leave at 12.30pm but takeoff had already been delayed by an hour when, as the plane sat on the tarmac at 1pm, the mock threat call from the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security arrived.        
	A man called up the Jet Airways control room claiming he was Barua, Delhi chief of Ulfa, and that a bomb had been planted on the flight, a source said.        
	All 106 passengers were evacuated and luggage was offloaded after moving the plane to an isolation bay, delaying the flight by a further three hours, sources said.        
	Bangladesh embassy sources confirmed that dignitaries had to disembark, but the official response denied any knowledge of the incident. Indian government sources were tight-lipped too.

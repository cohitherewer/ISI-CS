The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Modi men lock in rival loyalists

	Jaipur, Sept. 22: If locked out, just lock them in.        
	The continuing saga of the Rajasthan cricket establishment today got a T20-like twist with supporters of Lalit Modi, who was defeated as state association president six months ago, locking in loyalists of the current boss who had been instructed to keep out members of the rival faction.        
	The lock-in drama, which began around 11 this morning, is a follow-up to the turf battle that began on Sunday. The rival camp, owing allegiance to Modi, had held an annual general meeting in Jaipur and passed a no-confidence motion against Rajasthan Cricket Association president Sanjay Dixit, accusing him of being autocratic.        
	Modis fortunes in Rajasthan dipped following the electoral defeat of Vasundhara Raje, believed to be close to the cricket czar. However, sources said that while the current RCA (Rajasthan Cricket Association) regime had the blessings of the ruling Congress, chief minister Ashok Gehlot was not too keen to get involved in the cricket spat.        
	The immediate tussle between the factions is over who will represent Rajasthan in the annual general meeting of the Board of Control for Cricket in India on September 24. While Dixit, the RCA chief, is legally eligible to attend, his opponents insist that Rajendra Singh Rathore, who they appointed acting officiating president on Sunday, should represent the state.        
	Dixit, an IAS officer, could not be reached for comment, but on Sunday, he had dismissed the rival camps claims as theatrics and drama.        
	The divide got sharper this morning after supporters of Dixit barricaded and locked the RCA offices at the Sawai Man Singh Stadium when a few members of the rival faction, among them Rathore, former chief Subhash Joshi, and Bimal Soni, tried to enter.         
	The entire staff of the office was outside. Only gun-toting men and hooligans were inside, guarding the office. They had locked the office from inside so that we would not be able to enter. We in turn locked the offices from outside. At least eight to 10 of Dixits henchmen were inside. People will now know what sort of goonda raj Dixit is running here, Soni said.        
	The police were called in and an FIR was lodged against Dixit under Section 145 of the CrPC pertaining to prevention of breach of peace.        
	The rival faction members kept guard through the day and evening, though none from Dixits camp approached the office.         
	Dixits rivals took pains to explain what they were doing had nothing to do with Modi. It is Dixit who is helping Modi to make a comeback by suspending at least 10 district association presidents. They will naturally go to Modi for legal help, said Soni.        
	Dixit, who is Rajasthan horticulture secretary, had defeated Modi in a bitterly contested, court-monitored election on March 1.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Not will she or wont she but hasnt she
                                                                                                               Not will she or wont she but hasnt she
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                    Priyanka Gandhi                          
	For someone who has made a daily necessity of denying any intent to join politics, Priyanka Gandhi has peppered this campaign with annotations  often caustic, often cryptic  that have left little to doubt she is a keen politicker even if she professes no taste for it.         
	From Lalu Prasad to the Left, from Modi to Mayavati, it is the younger, and widely more fancied, Gandhi scion who has done the hard talking for party and parivar from her Amethi-Rae Bareli perch.         
	In almost every interaction that she has had with the media, Priyanka has emphasised shes only on the trail for personal reasons  For my mother and brother  but she has seldom fought shy of making hit-and-run strikes on issues and individuals far beyond the confines of Gandhi homeborough.         
	The Left, which Priyanka had no apparent cause to attack if she was out canvassing in east-central Uttar Pradesh only for personal reasons, has not been spared either.         
	The need of the hour for our country is to go forward into the modern era, where development is a need and the economy must be strong for this, she said on Tuesday. So any ideology that holds it back is regressive in that sense. I think it needs a little bit of a rethink.         
	But Prakash Karat and Co. may consider themselves lightly left off. Witness her response to Narendra Modi calling the Congress an ek sau pachees saal ki budhiya (a 125-year-old woman). Priyanka stepped out the next morning, a butterfly raring to sting like a bee. She flashed her electric smile at the first sight of television cameras: Kya main aapko budhiya lagtee hoon? (Do I look like an old woman to you?)         
	Riposte slammed, she piled injury deeper. L.K. Advani and Narendra Modi keep calling Rahul a child. They should then wonder about how old they themselves are!        
	Cousin Varun was equally bluntly dealt with for his communal hate speeches across Pilibhit, where he is contesting as BJP candidate. Retorting to Varuns alleged vow on the Gita that he would take care of Muslims, Priyanka said: I think he should read the Gita first. Varun has defamed the family and sullied the Nehru-Gandhi name by saying the kinds of things he has been saying.         
	Lalu Prasads blame game on the demolition of the Babri Masjid, she merely brushed aside as meaningless politics.         
	Asked what she thought about a major ally blaming the Congress for the demolition, she said: When political parties bring up things which actually are of no concern to the real issues of the election, I find it incongruent because I dont understand how politicians cannot understand that what they are saying is of no interest to the people. I really believe that in elections the real issues should be that of development, economics and how the country will move forward.         
	Neither has she spared Uttar Pradesh chief minister and Dalit protagonist Mayavati; no points to her for representing a long-repressed constituency, none for being a self-made woman leader either.         
	I know what she is trying to do. Its true that certain castes have been oppressed for centuries, and she has tried to empower them. But the way forward is to take everybody along, not to divide people on the basis of caste and religion.         
	And what of the other ally and DMK leader M. Karunanidhis support of Prabhakaran and his LTTE? How did it feel that an electoral partner was eulogising the assassins of her father? Part of that she did not answer, saying her views on those responsible for Rajiv Gandhis assassination were a personal matter. The other part, she cleverly batted aside quoting Karunanidhi as having retracted his support to Prabhakaran.         
	On how she perceived the prospects of the LTTE chief facing trial in India, she had a split response. This is a personal and political issue. I understand that politically Indias former Prime Minister was assassinated and so he cannot be forgiven from the countrys point of view. But from a humanitarian point of view, I feel nothing for him. There is no hatred or anger, I simply feel nothing.         
	When a journalist pressed on and asked her to respond to ADMK leader Jayalalithaa asking her to protest against the DMK position, Priyanka artfully dodged it: Oh, but these are political issues, and I do not want to comment on them, I am not in politics.         
	Are we to believe, then, that all she has been holding forth on during her extended outing for my mother and brother have been positions not even remotely political?         
	And for someone who professes no political interest beyond the two family seats, Priyanka has a hyperactive publicity machine backing her. Each speech of hers is emailed to a select, though huge, media list and at the end of each campaign day, dozens of photographs of her on the trail are processed and sent out.        
	After Amethi voted on Thursday, Priyanka has shifted next door to Rae Bareli where her mother is in the fray. We havent heard the last from her on this campaign yet. Congress-baiters, beware.

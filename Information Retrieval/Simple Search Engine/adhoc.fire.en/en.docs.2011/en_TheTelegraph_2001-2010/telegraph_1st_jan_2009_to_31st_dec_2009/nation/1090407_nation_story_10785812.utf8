The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Delimitation blow to MLAs
                                                                                                               Delimitation blow to MLAs
          LALMOHAN PATNAIK                          Cuttack city                                  
	Cuttack, April 6: The delimitation process of constituencies has apparently taken a toll on the fortunes of quite a few MLAs, including political bigwigs in coastal districts.        
	The new constituency maps, drawn to reflect latest demographic profile, had denied them the seats they once represented. Now they have been left in the electoral lurch without a party ticket to contest either in the Assembly or Lok Sabha elections.        
	BJDs Brahmananda Panda, elected to the Lok Sabha from Jagatsinghpur in 2004, was forced to leave the constituency after it was declared reserved for Scheduled Caste candidates. He was looking for a ticket from the newly carved Barabati Cuttack Assembly seat, but failed to make it in the final list of nominations.        
	Agriculture minister Surendra Nath Nayaks constituency Kakatpur, a segment under the Jagatsinghpur Lok Sabha seat, was declared reserved for SC candidates. The senior BJD leader will not contest the elections, too. So is the case with Dharmananda Behera, the MLA and president of Cuttack district BJD. Behera had lost his long-nurtured Choudwar Assembly constituency after it was abolished under the delimitation exercise.        
	Ironically, both Nayak and Behera were allowed by the party to file nominations for Bhubaneswar (central) and Salipur Assembly seats, respectively, but their names were withdrawn on the last day.        
	Among other MLAs in coastal Orissa who have been not been given party tickets after they lost their constituencies under the delimitation exercise include BJDs Kishore Tarai and Congresss Rabindra Mallick. They represented Pattamundai and Govindpur seats, which were abolished.        
	But not all have been unlucky. Delimitation seems to have brought a double bonanza for former excise minister Kalindi Behera. After Salipur  the constituency represented by the senior BJD leader  was dereserved, the party shifted him to the Sadar Cuttack seat reserved for Scheduled Castes. In addition, his son Chandrasarathi Behera was fielded from Salipur.        
	Another political heavyweight and BJD secretary-general Damodar Rout has been fielded from the newly carved Paradip after his constituency Ersama was bifurcated into Ersama-Balikuda and Paradip, and in the process Balikuda was abolished.

	New Delhi, Sept. 7 (PTI): Real estate developers cannot be fined for late delivery of a flat if no date of delivery is mentioned in the contract, the apex consumer body has ruled.        
	The National Consumer Commission passed the order on the plea of Ashok Khanna, who had sought compensation from the Ghaziabad Development Authority for the late delivery of a flat. The authority had also charged an extra sum from him, he alleged.              
	The commission observed that the allottee would not be entitled to compensation because he had the benefit of appreciation in the flats value.         
	Khanna had applied for the flat in 1988. The Ghaziabad Development Authority had agreed to give its possession within two years but as the work could not be completed, the builder asked the petitioner to deposit an additional sum for the delayed final settlement in 1993, which he had accepted.

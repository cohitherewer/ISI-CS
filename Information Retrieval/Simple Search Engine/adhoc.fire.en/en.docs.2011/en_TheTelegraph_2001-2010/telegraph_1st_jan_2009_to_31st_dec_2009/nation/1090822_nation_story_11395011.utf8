          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT       
	New Delhi, Aug. 21: India will restrict its national adult education programmes to districts where female literacy is less than 50 per cent.         
	The National Literacy Mission, which covers all 600 of the countrys districts, will now be implemented only in 374 districts where less than half the women are literate, education minister Kapil Sibal said today. States like Kerala, with no such districts, will no longer have the scheme.        
	The mission, started in 1988, is credited with a key role in raising the nations literacy rate from 53 per cent in 1991 to 65 per cent in 2001. This represents the largest jump in literacy in a decade in India. But the literacy rate remains skewed  75 per cent for males and 54 per cent for females according to the 2001 census.         
	There have been shortfalls that we want to address by tweaking the programme, Sibal said after a meeting with the literacy mission authority.         
	The restructured scheme will work towards a target of 80 per cent overall literacy by 2017, Sibal said. But we want to bridge the gender gap.        
	The schemes shift of focus towards female literacy was announced by President Pratibha Patil in her address to Parliament on June 4.        
	The new avatar of the scheme will expand the ambit of what it aims to teach, officials said. At present, anyone who can read, write and perform arithmetic up to Class III standards is considered literate. The mission has always tried to ensure its students meet this minimum standard, but the revised scheme will also offer skills programmes.         
	Sibals ministry will try to match the courses offered under the mission with those offered in formal education programmes. This would allow students to shift between non-formal and formal education systems, addressing a problem experienced by displaced people.        
	The literacy mission is now open only to those between 15 and 35 years. The restructured version will target all neo-literate and illiterate Indians in districts where the scheme is now introduced.        
	The Centre now directly co-ordinates with districts in implementing the mission, leaving out state governments. States, as a consequence, were not interested in the scheme. Now we will make them stakeholders, Sibal said.

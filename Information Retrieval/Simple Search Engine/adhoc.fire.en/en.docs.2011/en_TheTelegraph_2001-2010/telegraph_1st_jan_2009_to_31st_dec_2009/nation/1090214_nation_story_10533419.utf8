The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Abortion bar tussle in apex court
                                                                                                               Abortion bar tussle in apex court
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 13: The Supreme Court will decide whether a 39-year-old bar on aborting foetuses beyond 20 weeks  unless there is a risk to the mothers health  is obsolete and needs review.        
	The 20-week bar is obsolete. Heart defects in foetuses can only be determined after 20 weeks, senior counsel Colin Gonsalves said.         
	Almost every other western country permits termination of foetuses as old as 26-28 weeks. Safe termination of foetuses at an advanced stage of pregnancy is possible with advances in medical science.         
	Gonsalves was arguing for Mumbai-based gynaecologist Nikhil Datar, who has challenged a Bombay High Court decision denying one of his patients permission to abort a 24-week foetus with a congenital heart block. The child was delivered stillborn, just over a week after the court order of August 4, 2007.         
	After hearing his arguments, a bench headed by the chief justice issued notices to the Centre and the Maharashtra government.         
	Advocacy groups and some medical experts have been demanding that abortion of foetuses as old as 26-28 weeks be allowed, especially in cases where congenital defects are detected.                     
	Health minister A. Ramadoss referred the case to a special committee but nothing has been done yet.         
	At present, terminations are allowed beyond 20 weeks only when there is a danger to a womans life or risk to her physical or mental health, including cases of rape and failure of contraception.         
	The high court had dismissed the plea of Niketa and Haresh Mehta to abort their foetus on the grounds that a report by Mumbais government-run J.J. Hospital did not indicate that the child would definitely have abnormalities.         
	Doctors had told the Mehtas in the 24th week of pregnancy that the foetus had a congenital heart block, that it would need a pacemaker from birth and the quality of its life would be poor.         
	In the appeal, Datar said: During the last four decades, technology has changed dramatically and it is now undisputed that abortions can be carried out safely even in the 40th week.         
	He wondered why the words immediately necessary to save the life of a pregnant woman were being narrowly construed.         
	Does life mean beating of the heart or does it also include life undermined by a level of anguish and mental trauma caused by the compulsion of carrying a pregnancy to full term?         
	Datar raised questions on the right of a woman over her body. He asked if there ought to be legal impediments to a womans right to abortion and if the state ought to interfere with such a personal decision.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BSF fears influx of mutineers 
                                                                                                               BSF fears influx of mutineers

	New Delhi, Feb. 26: The Border Security Force is bracing for crossovers by the Bangladeshi mutineers into India.        
	Mehmaan-nawazi ke liye taiyar raho (Be ready to play host), said a BSF official as he received a message sent from a Bangladesh Rifles outpost.        
	Since this morning, two written requests and several oral requests have been received by BSF commanders from the BDR mutineers locked in battle with the Bangladesh army, which is taking over the border posts.        
	The first written message came to Hili in Bengals South Dinajpur district from a BDR post in Khulna. Another request was received at a border post in Meghalaya, sources said. Civilians were sent with the messages.         
	They have said, Do not fire at us even if there is some crossfire; we will fight the army till we can but if things get worse; we will come to you, we are counting on you, an authoritative BSF source said.         
	The BDR men are counting on the old friendship of the 1971 war and on recent improvement in relations with the BSF after a bad patch.        
	But the BSF is worried the Bangladesh army might pursue the mutineers into India.        
	BSF director-general M.L. Kumawat held separate meetings with home minister P. Chidambaram and cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar today.         
	The government has given the BSF clear instructions on how to deal with requests for refuge. BSF officials are to take the BDR men into custody as per procedure. They would be then handed over to the authorities at an appropriate time, a senior official said.         
	But if the guests do arrive, this would mean the Bangladesh army had seized control of the border posts and their hot pursuit of the mutineers into India is not ruled out.         
	While Chidambaram said our Indias borders were safe, no one is sure if they will remain quiet. If the Bangladesh army fires at us because of the BDR, then we will be left with no resort but to fire back, a senior BSF official said.         
	Skirmishes between the BDR and the army were reported from Lalmonihat and Panchghar near the Bengal border, where the fighting is like between sworn enemies. BSF sources said BDR men were this afternoon laying ambushes to the approach roads to border posts.         
	A vital bridge was blown up by the BDR to stop the army from advancing, thus snapping the link between Thakurgaon and Baliadang in Bangladesh which are adjacent to the border in north Bengal.

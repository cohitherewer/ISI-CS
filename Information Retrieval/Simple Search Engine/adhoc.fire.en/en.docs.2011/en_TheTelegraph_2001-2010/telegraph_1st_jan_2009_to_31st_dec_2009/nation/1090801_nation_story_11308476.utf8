          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Krishna: Self-defence                                  
	New Delhi, July 31: S.M. Krishna reacted to the Oppositions barbs by reminding Rajya Sabha members today he first came to Parliament in 1968 and that margin should be given to him.        
	The external affairs minister, mocked yesterday as Shivraj Patil II after finance minister Pranab Mukherjee defended the Centres foreign policy, pointed out that he had seen many eminent ministers and members reply and speak in Parliament.         
	Krishna hit back today after BJP members were on their feet complaining that he wasnt answering specific questions raised about the joint statement with Pakistan.        
	The trigger appeared to be a barb from a member that he better lay the speech on the table, instead of reading it. Krishnas assertion was meant to send the message that he was no novice to parliamentary debates and procedures.        
	Although he didnt come up with new arguments or points in his lengthy speech of over 45 minutes, he did address various matters, from the restructuring of his ministry to attacks on Indian students in Australia to Delhis support to the Palestine cause.        
	Krishna said the G-8 resolution on curbing the transfer of enrichment and reprocessing technology to non-NPT countries  a point the Opposition had often raised  was not a legally binding document, only a political statement.         
	On the end-user arrangement with the US, Krishna asserted that it didnt limit Indias sovereign choice of whether, where and what weapons we choose to buy for our national defence.        
	Touching on relations with the US, he said the ties had been transformed in recent years and held up the nuclear deal signed last year as a highpoint.        
	Participating in the debate earlier, leader of Opposition in the Upper House, the BJPs Arun Jaitley, said Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs praise of Atal Bihari Vajpayee for continuing talks with Pakistan could not shield him from his monumental lapse in reversing Indias consistent stand.         
	CPM leader Sitaram Yechury iterated his partys position that the government was becoming a subservient ally of the US.         
	Many speakers who foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon for his comment that the Pakistan joint statement was badly drafted.        
	Yechury sarcastically said: Its a truthful drafting. Its a reflection of (a) muddled mind. Menon, present in the officers gallery along with his successor Nirupama Rao, retired today.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | US visa hitch for BJP leader
                                                                                                               US visa hitch for BJP leader
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 19: Former Union minister and BJP Minority Morcha president Shahnawaz Hussain has failed to get an American visa on time, forcing him to drop out of a delegation of MPs flying tonight to New York to attend a UN meeting.        
	The American embassy said it was processing the visa application of Hussain, a Lok Sabha MP from Bihar and one of the BJPs prominent Muslim faces.         
	But Hussain, who has visited US thrice in the past and has a diplomatic passport, suggested he couldnt understand the unusual delay.        
	I was one among the five MPs who were to attend a UN General Assembly programme from October 20 to 31. Our ministry of external affairs had applied for the visas. While the others have got their visas and are leaving tonight, I have been told there will be a delay because of administrative processing, he said.        
	The other delegation members are Girija Vyas and Sanjay Nirupam from the Congress, Ali Anwar from the Janata Dal (United) and T.K.S. Elangovan from the DMK.        
	Hussain asked the Centre to take up the matter with American officials. Since the external affairs ministry applied for this visa and it is a normal diplomatic procedure, I dont understand why it should take so much time.        
	Hussain had last visited the US as Union textile minister in the NDA government post-9/11 in 2001.        
	Government sources, however, said the visa would be given to Hussain and that the delay was only procedural.         
	A few other members of the delegation, too, arent leaving tonight, because of prior personal engagements.

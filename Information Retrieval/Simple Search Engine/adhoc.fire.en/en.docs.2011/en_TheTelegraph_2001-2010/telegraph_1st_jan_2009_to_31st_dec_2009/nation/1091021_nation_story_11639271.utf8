                                                                                                               Strike brake   on auto capital
  - Over a lakh stay away after workers death in Gurgaon          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Policemen stand guard as Rico workers protest in Gurgaon on Tuesday. (PTI)                                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 20: Over one lakh employees of 70-odd companies struck work today in the Gurgaon-Manesar-Bawal belt in Haryana to protest the death of a colleague in a clash, hitting production in the countrys biggest auto-manufacturing hub.        
	The agitating employees beat up a senior manager of auto parts maker Rico Auto, the company which employed the dead worker, as the strike over pay hike got off to a violent start this morning.        
	The situation is volatile and many striking workers have gathered outside the gate. Deputy general manager Sanjiv Arya was beaten up in the presence of police, said Rico Auto vice-president, human resources, S.S Choudhary.        
	The company reported zero attendance as did firms like Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India and component major Sona Koyo.        
	The countrys largest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki India, however, said production was normal.        
	Our employees are not part of the strike. There is hundred per cent attendance and no downslide in production, a spokesperson said.        
	The situation had been tense since Sunday evening when some company workers, who had been on strike for higher pay, clashed with another group that had stayed away from the agitation. They had a heated argument followed by a clash in which a worker was critically injured and a motorcycle burnt, Gurgaon police commissioner Surjit Singh Deswal told PTI.        
	Ajit Kumar Yadav, 26, died later that night, triggering the worker backlash in the auto belt, which has seen several strikes in the past few years.        
	Around 2,500 contract workers at Hondas Gurgaon plant went on strike in April 2006 demanding immediate regularisation of casual employees. The previous year, labour unrest at the company had snowballed into a brutal battle between the police and hundreds of workers.        
	Rico Auto authorities today said the striking Trade Union Council, a group backed by CPI labour wing Aituc, was not a recognised union and its demand was unreasonable.        
	The workers are demanding an annual hike of Rs 10,000 per year. The matter is pending with the labour court, so there is no room for negotiation. The salaries of Ricos workers are on a par with industry standards, company sources said.        
	Aituc leader D.L. Sachdev said Rico workers had the right to form unions. The workers have been deprived of their right to form a trade union and we will not let this happen.        
	Suresh Gaud, Gurgaon district secretary, Aituc, who is leading the agitation, said the strike was a success. Over one lakh workers are participating and more than 70 factories have been affected, he said.        
	I want the Prime Minister to intervene, PTI quoted CPI MP and Aituc general secretary Gurudas Dasgupta as saying. We will offer unconditional dialogue with the government to resolve the matter.        
	The strike has come at a time when demand for new cars and two-wheelers is at an all-time high. Car sales in the first half of the year stood at 6,89,339 units against 6,00,738 units in the corresponding period the previous year  a growth rate of 14.75 per cent.        
	Workers are boycotting work and have joined the procession, though the general office staff have reported for duty. The assembly lines are not working, a Honda official said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | UPA seat-sharing on course to fight NDA
                                                                                                               UPA seat-sharing on course to fight NDA
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bonhomie: Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan                                  
	Patna, Feb. 23: UPA in Bihar has resolved to put up a united fight against the NDA in the Lok Sabha polls, with power players  LJP and RJD  preparing the seat-sharing module.        
	Railway minister and RJD chief Lalu Prasad declared that he would contest from Saran  earlier known as Chapra before the delimitation commission changed the demographical name  in the elections, dates of which would probably be announced next month. Lalu Prasads declaration to take the electoral battle from his favourite turf, which sent him to the Lok Sabha for the first time in 1977, coincides with the change in mood of LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan.        
	So far, Paswan was insisting not to settle on anything less than 16 seats. The chemical and fertiliser minister seems to have stepped down from his rigid stand, following the maverick RJD bosss visit to Paswans house to attend the birthday of his granddaughter.        
	Humne koi kasam nahin kha rakha hai (I have not taken vow). I have been insisting that UPA partners should contest in alliance to defeat the BJP-led forces. Exchange of a seat or two should not be an issue in the way of the bigger goal to defeat the communal forces, Paswan said after meeting, though the Dalit leader denied that he had discussed seat sharing with Lalu Prasad.        
	But Lalu Prasad was more vocal. The UPA will contest in full alliance in Bihar. We are determined to pack the communal forces lock, stock and barrel from the state. The ambition of L.K. Advani to become Prime Minister will end up a daydream.        
	However, sources both in LJP and RLD revealed that Lalu Prasad had agreed to spare 12 seats to LJP.         
	The only bone of contention is the Pataliputra seat, where the LJP wants to field Ranjan Yadav, while railway minister Lalu Prasad wishes to contest this seat, too, apart from Saran.        
	But Lalu Prasad clarified: Our united goal is to defeat the BJP-led NDA. Why should we fight among ourselves on a seat or two when we are gearing up for a bigger goal?         
	The statements of two top leaders of their respective parties reflect flexibility rather than rigidity in the run-up to the general elections.        
	The LJP had contested eight seats in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections against Congresss four. Sources close to Lalu Prasad and Paswan revealed that they were ready to spare five seats for the Congress this time.         
	The Congress, so far, has been asking for 10 seats, which it is hardly likely to get.        
	Moreover, the UPA partners are also likely to accommodate Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) by sparing the Katihar seat for Tariq Anwar, who had won the seat a couple of times before 2004.         
	Lalu Prasad has all along been describing the Left as trusted and natural ally.         
	But it is not yet clear how the Left, which is so far dead opposed to the Congress and has been working with Mayavati, Ajit Singh and Chandrababu Naidu to form a third front, would fit in Lalu Prasads scheme of things.         
	Moreover, it is also not clear which seat the Lalu Prasad-led UPA in Bihar would spare to the Left with the UPA partners, including RJD, LJP and Congress, locking in tough competition to get more seats in their share ahead of the polls.

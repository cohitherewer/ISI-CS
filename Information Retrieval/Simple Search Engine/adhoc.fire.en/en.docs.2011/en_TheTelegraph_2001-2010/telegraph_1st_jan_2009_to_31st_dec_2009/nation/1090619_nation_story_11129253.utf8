          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Patna, June 18: A Bihar court has ordered an FIR to be lodged against LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan for making defamatory remarks against JD(U) rival Ram Sunder Das, who defeated Paswan on the Hajipur Lok Sabha seat.        
	Chief judicial magistrate of the Hajipur district court Prem Mishra took cognisance to a complaint lodged by JD(U) minority cell leader Nayeem Akhtar, who accused Paswan of making offensive comments against Das and directed the Hajipur superintendent of police to lodge an FIR against the LJP chief under Sections 510, 500 and 5004 of the IPC, dealing with insult, misconduct and defamation.        
	The petition filed by Akhtar charged Paswan of resorting to insults while addressing an LJP workers meeting organised at Hajipur recently. When contacted, Hajipur SP Parasnath said that his office was yet to receive the order. Action will be taken once the order is received, he said.        
	While talking to the media today, Paswan said his party and Lalu Prasad would fight together for the by-election to 15 Assembly seats and the 2010 Assembly polls. In Bihar now, RJD-LJP alliance along with the secular parties such as the Congress and the Left are the only alternative, he said. Drubbed in the Lok Sabha polls, Paswan has been engaged in organising meetings throughout the state to understand the reasons behind the LJP debacle.        
	We have organised district and block-level meetings to galvanise workers and motivate them to expose the anti-people and anti-Dalit policies of the Nitish government, he said.

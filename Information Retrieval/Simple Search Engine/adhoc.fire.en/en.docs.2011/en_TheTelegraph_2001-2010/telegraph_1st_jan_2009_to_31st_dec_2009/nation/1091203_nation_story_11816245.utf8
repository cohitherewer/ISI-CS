	New Delhi, Dec. 2 (PTI): Air passengers and people carrying large amounts of cash can be detained by authorities for questioning and this cannot be dubbed a violation of personal liberty in view of growing cases of terrorism, the Supreme Court has ruled.         
	The court said frisking and detaining passengers was in the national interest. Otherwise it would enable terrorists to conduct their activities unchecked.        
	The nation is facing a terrorist threat. Transportation of large sums of money is associated with distribution of funds for terrorist activities, illegal payoffs etc. There is also rampant circulation of unaccounted black money destroying the economy of the country. In this background, if the officers want to fully satisfy themselves that the funds were not intended for any illegal purpose, such action cannot be termed high-handed or unreasonable, the bench said.        
	The court dismissed an appeal by Rajendran Chingaravelu, a US-returned computer engineer, seeking guidelines from the government against alleged harassment of passengers in the name of frisking.

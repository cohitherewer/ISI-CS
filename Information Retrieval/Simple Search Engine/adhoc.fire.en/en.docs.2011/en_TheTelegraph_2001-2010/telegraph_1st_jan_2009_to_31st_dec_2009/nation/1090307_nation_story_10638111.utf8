                                                                                                               Tussle over alliance
          RASHEED KIDWAI                                    Amar, Sonia: Face-off                                  
	New Delhi, March 6: The war of attrition between the Congress and the Samajwadi Party continued, with both sides acting belligerent in public but privately trying to sink differences.         
	Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh hurried from his hospital bed in Mumbai to take charge of negotiations in Delhi.         
	Amar said the party would not offer more than 17 Lok Sabha seats to the Congress in Uttar Pradesh, where Sonia Gandhis party has already announced candidates for 24 seats.         
	Terming the announcement of the candidates yesterday the obituary of the Congress-Samajwadi alliance, Amar said: The Samajwadi Party cannot leave more than 17 seats for the Congress.        
	Amar said he and party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav were under pressure from workers against parting with seats the party now holds.         
	However, as a conciliatory gesture, Amar wrote a polite letter to Sonia Gandhi today reiterating his partys commitment to back a secular government and underlining the need for unity against casteist and communal forces.         
	The Samajwadi general secretary wrote that the Congress move to field candidates from Farrukhabad, Rampur, Pratapgarh and a few other seats now held by his party required review.         
	Amar added that his party would not contest from Rae Bareli and Amethi, held by Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, whether or not the alliance works out.         
	Congress leaders also sounded cautious. A senior office-bearer said: The alliance with the Samajwadi Party will continue till the time they do not field candidates from the 17 seats offered to us. There could be a situation that we (Samajwadi-Congress) do not fight each other in these 17 seats and face the elections without a formal alliance.         
	In such a scenario, Congress leaders said, they would not name any more candidates other than the 24 already announced.         
	Asked about the seven seats where the two sides would be pitted against each other, a Congress leader said: There could be friendly fights or we could withdraw a few names if the Samajwadi Party concedes a few more seats.         
	Congress leaders said they were hoping for Rahuls intervention to clinch the alliance. But it was not clear whether he would meet Amar or Mulayam.

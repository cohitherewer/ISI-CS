                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      26/11 amp; criticism? Must be politics
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 26: The BJP, led by L.K. Advani, today demanded better co-ordination of rehabilitation efforts for the 26/11 victims, triggering a chain of events leading to a sparring match in the Lok Sabha with Pranab Mukherjee.        
	The BJPs Ananth Kumar demanded that Mukhjerjee, the leader of the House, respond to Advanis statement, triggering an angry response from the finance minister.        
	You have tried to politicise issues earlier and were paid back in the same coin. Now you are trying to use 26/11, and you will be paid back in the same coin again, Mukherjee said, his eyes on Advani sitting directly across him.        
	Soon, other Congress MPs joined Mukherjee as the issue of rehabilitation got buried in a slanging match, with each side accusing the other of playing politics.        
	The finance minister was arguing that the BJP was trying to set an incorrect precedence of seeking a response from the leader of the House on every issue raised in Zero Hour.        
	Repeated requests from Speaker Meira Kumar to respect todays solemn occasion and allow Parliament proceedings had little impact.        
	The day started in the House with all members observing a two-minute silence and passing a resolution in memory of the Mumbai terror victims this day last year.        
	Advani, speaking at the start of Zero Hour, cited statistics provided to him by former BJP MP Kirit Somaiya that suggested that the Maharashtra and central governments had failed to provide promised compensation to most victims.        
	Advani said 12 different agencies  eight of the state government and four of the Centre  were involved in the compensation process and that this had led to confusion for victims. He argued for better co-ordination.        
	The families of 403 victims  164 dead and 239 seriously injured  are eligible for compensation promised by the Prime Minister, Advani said, adding that only 118 have received it so far.        
	The home ministry, which promised an independent compensation package, has cleared only 98 proposals so far, he alleged. Advani added that the railway claims tribunal had cleared only 42 of 150 eligible families  of the victims of the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus.        
	It would be very sad if some victims family has to come to Delhi to beg for the compensation, Advani said, suggesting that the home ministry co-ordinate all compensation efforts.        
	Mukherjee, who was in his chamber at the start of Advanis statement, came to his seat on the front row of the House to listen to the BJP leader.        
	I came only to listen to him (Advani), not to listen to you, Mukherjee shouted at Ananth Kumar as the MP demanded a response to Advanis statement from the finance minister.

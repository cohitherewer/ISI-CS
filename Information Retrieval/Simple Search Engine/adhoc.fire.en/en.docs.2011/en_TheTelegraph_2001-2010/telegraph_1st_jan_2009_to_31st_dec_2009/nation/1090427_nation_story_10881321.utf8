The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | MIFFED with MAUSAM
                                                                                                               MIFFED with MAUSAM
  - Ghani Khan nieces Malda test gets tougher as unforgiving uncles dub her a family betrayer        ASHIS CHAKRABARTI IN MALDA                        Mausam Noor campaigns in Malda North. Picture by Surajit Roy				                                       
	Dhanchand Murmu is busy erecting a mud wall of his hut when the convoy of motorbikes and cars stops at the village. His hands and face soiled with mud, he moves forward to the roadside to have a closer look at the young woman getting down from the jeep.         
	Its that time of the year for Murmu  and all others in the village  when the arid land turns the cruellest. All around are the pictures of poverty and desolation that sum up life in his Ganguria and other villages in Habibpur. For miles around all one sees are parched fields, dried-up ponds and even riverbeds and mud huts with roofs of tin or clay tiles.         
	With no rain for the last seven months, this years drought is proving particularly hard for the villagers in many parts of Malda, especially in Habibpur, Bamongola, Gajol and Old Malda blocks.         
	So when Mausam Benazir Noor, the young Congress candidate from the Malda North constituency, stops at the village, Dhanchand tells her of the villagers plight. He did so when Sailen Sarkar, a minister in the state government and the CPM candidate, had come a few days back.         
	Mausam, though, knows how hard its for the poor Adivasis living there. Thats why, she says, she doesnt speak of the so-called national issues during her campaign. Theres no road, no water, no electricity here. Whats the point of talking of big things?         
	But who or what is to blame for this state of things? The CPM, of course, says the smart and suave Mausam, who has worked with a well-known solicitors firm and practised in the Supreme Court. Thirty-two years in power and this is their Bengal.         
	Shes right  Habibpur has always been a CPM stronghold and always elected the party to the Assembly.         
	But what about her Baromama, the late A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhury, who had been an MP from Malda for 26 uninterrupted years? What about her own party, which has been in power in the Malda zilla parishad since 2003?         
	Her answer: Baromama has done a lot for Maldas development. Still learning the ropes in politics, she is relying heavily on his legacy. Im Ghani Khans bhagnee (niece), she never fails to remind her voters.         
	Dhanchand and people like him take a backseat when it comes to elections in Malda. Three years after his death, the late Ghani Khan continues to dominate the scene, at least for the Congress.         
	Mausam, one of the youngest Congress candidates in these elections anywhere in the country, is new to politics, having joined it only on her mother Ruby Noors death and winning the latters Sujapur Assembly constituency earlier this year.         
	No surprises in the story so far. Malda has been Congress country in Red Bengal, thanks to her late Baromama and the Congress in Malda has always meant the Khan Chowdhury family. The late Ghani Khans brother, Abu Hashem Khan Chowdhury, inherited the Malda seat in a byelection in 2006 following Ghani Khans death.         
	The problem arose when her Lebumama, Abu Naser Khan Chowdhury, was passed over by the Congress high command in favour of Mausam for the Malda North constituency, apparently because the former, who had been a Swiss citizen, failed to give that up and become an Indian citizen again in time for filing the nomination. Hed been nursing Malda North for a year hoping to get the ticket from there.         
	Lebumama and even Dalumama (Hashem) have not forgiven either Pranab Mukherjee or Mausam for the unfair deal. The brothers are together and are campaigning in Malda South, where Hashem is the Congress candidate.         
	This girl has betrayed the family. She kept us in the dark, Naser says, sitting in the drawing room of his portion of the family house at Kotwali. Hashem is also upset that she never took her uncles into confidence.         
	The anger of her two uncles has forced Mausam to seek guidance from her eldest sister Sonia, who lives in the US, and her other sister Syeda, who has been camping in the family home.         
	As if the family problems werent enough, Mausam knows her constituency is tougher than her uncles Malda South. Five of the seven Assembly segments are with the CPM, which also had 53 per cent of the panchayat seats in the 2008 rural polls. But she could be lucky if the anti-CPM wind blowing in Bengal hits old CPM bastions like Gajol, even her sulking Lebumama concedes.         
	By comparison, Hashem has a better chance in Malda South, the traditional Congress belt. The CPM, though, is confident to make it a tougher fight even there. The partys hope is largely based on the fact that it has fielded a Muslim candidate, Abdur Razzak, a retired college principal, against him. This is the first time the party has fielded a Muslim candidate in parliamentary elections in Malda.         
	Thatll make a difference, Razzak says, rather diffidently. No, it wont, says Hashem, Malda doesnt vote on communal lines, like they do in Murshidabad.         
	But if anyone knows that the late Ghani Khans name is not necessarily an election winner, it is Naser. He used his brothers name and lost a Lok Sabha election in Jangipur, now Pranab Mukherjees constituency in Murshidabad district.         
	And he lost the last Assembly polls (2006) to the CPM from Kaliachak even after parading Ghani Khans body through its streets just a few weeks before voting.         
	But one thing is for sure  with Ghani Khan gone, the house that ruled Malda and the Congress in Malda is losing its control. And, the family feud in these elections is not the only reason for that.        
	 Malda votes on April 30

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Notice to Gujarat in Ishrat case
                                                                                                               Notice to Gujarat in Ishrat case
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 6: The Supreme Court today issued notices to authorities in Gujarat on a petition filed by Ishrat Jahans mother Shamima Kauser.        
	Kauser is seeking a stay on the Gujarat High Court order that prevented her from using magistrate S.P. Tamangs report to remove the terrorist tag from her dead daughters name.        
	The learned single judge of the high court displayed inordinate haste in his condemnation of the inquiry report of the magistrate, her petition said.        
	Kausers lawyer Kamini Jaiswal said her client did not expect a fair investigation from Gujarat police regarding the encounter and sought an independent probe into her daughters death. The apex court then issued notices in this regard to the Centre and the CBI.        
	Ishrat was killed in an encounter by the Gujarat police on June 15, 2004, along with three other men. An FIR registered by the state police claimed that she was a Lashkar-e-Toiba (LeT) operative.        
	However, the magistrate who inquired into the shootout submitted his report on September 9 this year saying the encounter was fake.

	New Delhi, Sept. 22: Delhi police suspect that the Maoist politburo member arrested on Sunday visited the capital frequently to recruit cadre.        
	While there is no official word on just how long Khobad Ghandy had been in Delhi before he was held, sources say he was there for at least six months.         
	Sleuths of the special cell suspect the 58-year-old, said to be in charge of the publication wing of the CPI (Maoist) and of spreading the organisations influence in urban areas, wasnt alone in Delhi.         
	It is not clear, however, if he had managed to establish a cadre base in the city.         
	The police say they are yet to interrogate Ghandy. But joint commissioner (special cell) P.N. Agarwal confirmed that no other state police had approached his force for a joint interrogation.        
	Sources say Ghandy, now in Tihar jail, had been allowed to make one phone call after his arrest but its not clear whom he had contacted.         
	His brother-in-law, theatre director Sunil Shanbagh, said he hadnt received any call from Ghandy.         
	The Maoists parents and only brother are dead. He has a sister, who is married to Shanbagh.         
	Sources in Tihar, where the Doon-school educated Ghandy has been kept with other undertrials, say he is under watch as he has a heart problem.        
	Special Cell sources say the tip-off leading to his arrest had come from Andhra Pradesh police.         
	The information on at least three of Maoist leaders held in recent months from various parts of the country had come from Andhra, the sources added.

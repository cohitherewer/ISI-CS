	New Delhi, Nov. 2 (PTI) The government will not sanction any leave travel allowance (LTA) for employees who use personal car or taxi as mode of transport.        
	However, the rule will not apply to employees with a handicap or disability or with a dependent family member who has a disability.        
	According to a government notification, the employees can apply for the LTA only if they travel by Indian Railways or Air India and state transport corporation buses.        
	The order issued by the department of personnel said the LTA facility would be admissible only for journeys made in vehicles operated by the government or any corporation in the public sector run by the central government, state government or a local body.        
	 However, the government has relaxed the order for physical handicap or disability of self or dependent family members who are unable to travel by authorised modes of transport and are compelled to undertake the journey by own car or private taxis.        
	Such employees will have to take a medical certificate from the competent authority, besides giving an undertaking that the journey in the authorised mode is not feasible. The claim should not be for a sum more than the journey by the entitled class by rail or air.

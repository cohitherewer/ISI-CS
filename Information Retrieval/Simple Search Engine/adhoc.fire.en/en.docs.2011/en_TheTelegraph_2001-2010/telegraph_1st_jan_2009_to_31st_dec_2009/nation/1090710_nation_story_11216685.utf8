The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitish to sound Bengal, Orissa to take up cudgels against Centre
                                                                                                               Nitish to sound Bengal, Orissa to take up cudgels against Centre
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, July 9: Smarting under what he described as the cruel neglect of Bihar in the Budget-2009, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar is reportedly at work to expose the anti-poor character of the Congress-led UPA dispensation.         
	For this, he is said to be contemplating the formation a conglomeration of states comprising Bengal, Orissa and Bihar  all of which are suffering pangs of neglect ever since the Independence.         
	The conglomeration will bring to the fore, the true face of the UPA in the run-up to the Bihar Assembly elections in 2010.        
	We are contemplating the formation of a conglomeration of poor eastern states that were once permanent settlements under the British Raj and have been neglected since Independence by the Centre, said JD(U) national general secretary and party MP Shivanand Tiwary.        
	In a conversation with The Telegraph the leader said: We will request our chief minister to take a lead in this regard and formalise the conglomeration that would address our common cause (perpetual neglect).         
	The Congress is trying to revive itself in the poor states by fooling people. Sonia Gandhi and her party must realise why people began loathing the Congress in these states and drove it out of power decades ago, he said.         
	JD(U) strategists feel that the political ambience in these three states, particularly with the Assembly elections around the corner in Bihar and Bengal, is conducive to stoke the anti-Congress fire.         
	JD(U) grapevine has it that while the embattled Left  currently threatened by Mamata Banerjees Trinamul and a part of the UPA will have little trouble in synchronising its anti-Congress tuning with Nitish Kumar. Biju Patnaik, too, is far from being happy with the Congress at the Centre.         
	Politically astute Nitish Kumar has been referring continually to a group of backward states as a point of reference, while attacking the Centre, rather than speak of Bihar alone.         
	Governments of backward states had been hopeful that after the Prime Ministers commitment, in reply to the motion of thanks to the President, steps to mitigate regional inequalities would find a prominent place in the budget, said Nitish said in a written statement.         
	Our request for a special category status and a special package to Bihar have been totally ignored.         
	Government and JD(U) sources revealed that the chief minister was at work to prepare a dossier specifically listing instances to prove the Congress-led Centres turning Nelsons eyes on the cause of Bihar.         
	The chief minister is currently spending time on the pre-dossier home work. Besides, he is soliciting the support of his anti-Congress neighbours to ensure that the Congress stands throttled in the coming Assembly polls. And the Left in the neighbouring state has no reason not to support Nitish, said a senior JD(U) leader, adding: The Left leaders have always been very friendly with the JD(U).         
	In fact, Nitish Kumars cabinet colleague and Bihar road construction minister Prem Kumar yesterday gave enough hint of how the states ruling dispensation was getting into a combative mood against the Congress.         
	The Centre is simply sleeping on our proposals for the state development. It did not sanction the proposal for express highways in Bihar. While central agencies such as Central Public Works Department and Ircon are doing their work at a snails pace. The state will take stern action against these agencies for their failure to perform in Bihar, Prem Kumar said in Assembly yesterday.

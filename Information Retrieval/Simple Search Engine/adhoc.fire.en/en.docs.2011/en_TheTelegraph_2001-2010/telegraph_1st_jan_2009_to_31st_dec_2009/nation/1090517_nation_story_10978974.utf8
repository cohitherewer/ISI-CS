The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Left and Right, challengers to the crown lie flattened 
                                                                                                               Left and Right, challengers to the crown lie flattened 
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                                             
	New Delhi, May 16: Congress cannons have boomed Left and boomed Right in the partys stunning surge, and hammered the political ambitions of the two men whod set out to oust the Sonia-Manmohan combine from power.         
	BJP frontrunner L.K. Advanis final push for prime ministership lies so firmly repulsed, the 82-year-old may not have opportunity to recover; he has already signalled a resignation to fate, indicating he wants to be leader of Opposition no more.         
	Left pretender Prakash Karats first real thrust for power in Delhi has been so rudely knocked, he will probably have to spend coming years picking up the pieces of his crumbled citadels in Bengal and Kerala rather than planning assaults on the capital.         
	Both men have publicly undertaken to review what went wrong with their respective challenges, but a few reasons have made themselves apparent. Advani failed to articulate the change he sought both conceptually and substantively  he gave the electorate no reason good or fetching enough why they should ditch the UPA and embrace the NDA.         
	Karat, on the other hand, may have articulated a change that failed to make a connect beyond the anterooms of his party; in breaking with the Congress over the Indo-US nuclear deal, he chose a battle cry that had little domestic resonance.         
	Did they also misread Manmohan Singh as politically too anodyne? Easy meat? Perhaps, but in varying degrees. Karat probably convinced himself he could pull Manmohan down if he pulled out  do the N-deal with the US and be prepared to face elections, he warned ahead of the Left-Congress rupture last summer. He probably did not account for the dogged pusher and hardboiled politicker in Manmohan. He probably did not imagine the macro economist could also play political retailer.                   
	Advani, as the verdict amply suggests, erred in making the contest too personal, too bitter, chastising Manmohan consistently as a weak and worthless leader  kamzor, nikamma. As it turns out, the electorate believes rather the opposite; It has rendered the self-professed lauh purush (iron man), the mazboot neta, emaciated in the twilight of his career; Singh is King, the voter has said.         
	But the reasons for the reverses the two contenders have suffered go beyond personal wars and wagers. They have a lot to do with their respective home politics, too.         
	Advanis bid was queered by ideological and organisational dishevelment in the Sangh ranks which intensified rather than ebbed as the campaign peaked. Traditionally, the BJP has prided its cohesion of view and machinery. This time, both were victims of various degrees of chaos.         
	The dispute over the precedence Ram Mandir should get in the partys order of priorities, Advanis own keenness to veer away from his hardliner image and turn a moderate magnet, the ugly squabble over who should be part of the election committee and who shouldnt, Advanis failure to prevent open discord or to discipline it, the muddled and factional projection of Narendra Modi as successor to Advani in 2014 when the campaign for 2009 had not even peaked.         
	The message that went out to the electorate was not of a cohesive alternative to the UPA, it was the message of a party mired in its own chaos and confusions.         
	Karat probably confronted a much more complex set of challenges and responded poorly. A classically ideology-driven man who has often been blamed for giving short shrift to political and electoral concerns, Karat assumed charge of the CPM, and by implication of the Left, at a critical time. The Left was a year into its partnership with the UPA, but here was a man untutored in the fine art of coalition politics; Karat left the day-to-day fronting to Sitaram Yechury, ever the keener student of the pragmatic Harkishen Singh Surjeet.         
	But having relieved himself of those tasks, Karat couldnt take more urgent housekeeping tasks in hand. An unprecedented crisis brewed in Kerala and it attracted unprecedented measures. The suspension of chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan and state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan was a first. But having taken action, the party decided to paper over the feud. The suspensions were revoked, the feuding continues to this day and it probably contributed substantially to the LDFs decimation in Kerala.         
	In Bengal, over and above the many disadvantages of a 32-year incumbency, there were urgent issues of programme and ideology screaming to be straightened out.         
	Led by Karat, the Left took a pronounced anti-liberalisation, anti-market posture in Delhi. But in Bengal, the necessities of governance and growth turned Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to wooing the market and investment after the fashion of Manmohan.         
	There was a growing subterranean dissonance between the adopted ideology of the party and the policies it was pursuing in Bengal. They erupted in Singur. And then in Nandigram. Mamata Banerjee actually grabbed the stance and territory that was once the CPMs  championing rural rights against the expansion of private industry. None of these, Karat was able, or willing, to address.         
	Rather, he chose to ignore them in his pursuit of a lofty ideological battle against US imperialism over the nuclear deal. Call it ideological firmness, call it political inflexibility, Karat broke with the UPA on the N-deal over reservations from within his ranks.         
	As one Left observer put it, the communists may not have been for the deal, but equally, they may not have thought it a big enough issue to pick a fight on when more urgent correction were screaming for Karats attention.         
	Having led the Left to its lowest perch in the memory of three generations, Karat may now have enough time and space to ponder for lowly as it is, this perch is also a lonely place.

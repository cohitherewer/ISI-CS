The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitish slams biased Pranab
                                                                                                               Nitish slams biased Pranab
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, July 6: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar today slammed finance minister Pranab Mukherjee for shelling out a raw deal to Bihar in Budget-2009, while his party MPs walked out from the Lok Sabha protesting against the step-motherly treatment towards the state.        
	I have nothing against him (Pranab Mukherjee) providing relief to Aila victims in Bengal. But why did the finance minister not mention the devastation caused by the Kosi, which displaced almost 30 lakh people, asked the chief minister, describing the budget as disappointing and unfair.        
	Talking to the media, Nitish rued that though Pranab Mukherjee referred to economist Kautilya in his budget speech, he neglected the land that gave the country its Kautilya. He neglected the land in which Kautilya belonged to. He has done a great betrayal to the state.        
	Going on to describe the finance minister as negatively biased, the chief minister said that the NDA MPs would not sit silent on the cruel neglect.         
	We will meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to raise the issue of deliberate neglect, said the chief minister, reminding all of how the states demand of a special category status and of Rs 14,800 crore to rebuild areas under the Kosi belt was still pending with the Centre.        
	It is unfortunate that the Union budget is silent on the special status issue. There was no word spoken about the promise (of a special financial package) made to the state in the FMs speech, Nitish told reporters.         
	In 2004 on coming to power, the UPA had promised to grant a special financial package to Bihar and subsequently, just before the results for the last Lok Sabha polls were declared, Congress leaders also expressed their views on the issue, he reminded the media.        
	Nitish Kumar said that the budget presented by Pranab Mukherjee was opposed to what the UPA in general and Congress leaders in particular have been promising for the past five years.         
	We will not sit silent, he said, but did not elaborate on what he or his party would actually do to oppose the neglect to the state.        
	Even RJD boss Lalu Prasad raised the issue of the Kosi flood relief in course of the FMs speech. Though his party MPs did not join JD(U) counterparts in staging a walkout, the Bihar unit of the RJD strongly opposed the budget.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | From bully to peoples minister
                                                                                                               From bully to peoples minister
          G.C. SHEKHAR                          Azhagiri: Makeover?                                  
	Chennai, June 15: The district collector has competition  from the peoples minister.        
	Ever since M.K. Azhagiri returned to Madurai after taking over as Union minister for chemicals and fertilisers, the number of people with complaints who usually crowd outside the collectorate has come down.        
	They have been taking their petitions directly to the minister in the hope of faster redress.        
	This morning, too, when collector N. Mathivanan met the public for his scheduled weekly interaction, he saw the crowd outside his office was much less than usual.        
	A few discreet enquiries revealed the reason behind the relatively thin attendance: the petitioners were presenting their complaints at another address in Madurai  that of Azhagiri.        
	Mathivanan nodded, collected the petitions from those who had come to meet him, and retreated into his office.        
	In TVS Nagar, some 7-8km away, voices rose and fell in a shed outside a bungalow.        
	One of Azhagiris aides said the minister had appointed more people to receive petitions and segregate them area-wise for scrutiny and action.        
	He spends at least three hours every day going through them and marking his comments to the officials concerned. In some cases, he picks up the phone and talks to them directly.        
	Although Azhagiris move to camp in Madurai rather than meet ministry officials in Delhi has raised many eyebrows, chief minister M. Karunanidhis son looks determined to use his cabinet stint to tone up his image as a peoples minister.        
	One of the first petitions he received was from a local farmer association that complained about scarcity of fertilisers at the beginning of the sowing season. The association said it had to buy fertilisers from the black market last year to start farming.        
	Azhagiris action was prompt. He had 2,400 tonnes of the fertiliser diammonium phosphate delivered to state godowns and distributed to farmers in Madurai.        
	The publicity given to that Azhagiri action resulted in more grievances being brought to his doorstep.        
	We normally receive about 500 to 600 petitions every Monday but in the last two weeks the number has dwindled to less than 200 as petitioners have been going to the ministers residence, said an official at the Madurai collectorate.        
	But he added that most petitions submitted to Azhagiri were ultimately redirected to the collector for necessary action.        
	DMK insiders say Azhagiris transformation from a man with a brash, bullying image to a peoples minister was part of a move to position himself strongly in the succession fight with younger brother M.K. Stalin.        
	Ever since Stalin was made the deputy chief minister, the government machinery has worked overtime to highlight his meetings and decision-making prowess. So Azhagiri wants to prove he is no less dynamic though relatively new to being part of the administration, said a senior DMK minister in Tamil Nadu.        
	The cold war between the brothers was there for all to see when Stalin attended a high-profile event to inaugurate a water project in Ramanthapuram district, next door to Madurai.         
	Although father Karunanidhi inaugurated the project through video-conferencing, Azhagiri chose to stay away, preferring to receive petitions at his Madurai residence.

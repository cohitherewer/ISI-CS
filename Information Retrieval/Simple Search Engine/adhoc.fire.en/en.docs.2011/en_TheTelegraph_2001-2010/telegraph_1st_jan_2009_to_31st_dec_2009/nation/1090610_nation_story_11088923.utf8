          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 9: The Assembly today witnessed an uproar when the Naxalites issue was broached, especially after Sunday nights attack on a Koraput police station and an outpost.        
	The Opposition Congress staged a walkout during the question hour demanding extensive discussion while the Speaker rejected the demand of taking up the discussion suspending all other businesses.        
	Leader of the Opposition Bhupinder Singh rose to raise the demand and blamed the attack on a failed administration. Police and government staff are scared, said Singh.        
	However, Speaker Pradip Kumar Amat Chose to proceed with the question-answer programme. Let the public not get a message that we take the Maoist issue lightly, said Singh.        
	While his repeated demands went unheeded, the Singh blamed the Speaker of failing to protect the Opposition and staged a walkout.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Faces are fresh, but not surnames   Behind most young legislators lies the legacy of a political family 
                                                                                                               Faces are fresh, but not surnames     -  Behind most young legislators lies the legacy of a political family 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                                  
	New Delhi, May 24: G.V. Harsha Kumar from Amalapur in Andhra Pradesh is a second-time Lok Sabha member like Rahul Gandhi and Sachin Pilot, but the 49-year-old is the least likely of the three to become a minister.        
	The growing clamour to give young politicians a chance to prove their mettle has thrown up fresh faces that could lead the countrys politics in the years to come. But from the capital of India to the islands that make up its periphery, many of the young MPs merely add new faces to old political names.        
	There are some, like Kumar and Meenakshi Natarajan, both Congress MPs from Andhra Pradesh, who did compete and win without a powerful surname behind them.        
	But in the race for young MPs to be blooded in Manmohan Singhs second government, the likes of Kumar and Natarajan are not expected to even come up for consideration.        
	Jyotiraditya Scindia, Pilot and Jitin Prasada  sons of famous fathers  are the young blood from the Congress tipped to win ministerial posts when the second swearing-in is held next week.        
	In Delhi, chief minister Sheila Dikshits son Sandeep contested, and won, a second time, a feat also accomplished in Mumbai by Priya Dutt, daughter of the late actor and Union minister Sunil Dutt. Their names, too, will swirl in the corridors of power in the coming years each time a cabinet reshuffle is due.        
	The Congress and Trinamul may be celebrating their resurgence in Bengal, but the only replacements they could find for late Malda strongman A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhury were from his family.        
	Jyoti Mirdha, one of the Congresss most prominent young MPs from Rajasthan, where the party won 20 of 25 seats, is the granddaughter of the late Nathuram Mirdha, a Congress veteran. Nathuram had won from Nagaur in Rajasthan even in 1977, when an anti-Indira Gandhi storm swept the Congress away from most of north India.        
	The Congress winner from Lakshadweep was P.M. Hamdulla Sayeed, son of the late P.M. Sayeed.        
	In Maharashtra, the party risked rebellion in Sangli to field Pratik Patil, grandson of former chief minister Vasantdada Patil. Ajit Ghorpade, a Congress MLA from the region and the man considered best equipped for the contest by party workers, contested as an Independent in protest against dynasty politics, supported by the BJP-Shiv Sena combine.        
	The Congresss latest MP from the coastal constituency of Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg is Nilesh Rane, son of former Shiv Sena leader Narayan Rane, who is now with the Congress.        
	The Congress, however, isnt alone in focusing on established political families while looking for young politicians to blood.        
	When Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar decided to quit electoral politics and move to the Rajya Sabha, he gifted his political fief Baramati to daughter Supriya Sule. Eventually, Pawar himself contested too, from neighbouring Madha, and both father and daughter are MPs in the 15th Lok Sabha.        
	The NCPs MP from Nashik is Sameer Bhujbal, nephew of senior party leader Chhagan Bhujbal.        
	The BJPs young faces in Rajasthan bore famous names, too. Manvendra Singh, son of former foreign minister Jaswant Singh, lost from Barmer this time, after winning majestically in 2004.        
	Former chief minister Vasundhara Rajes son Dushyant won a second time from family bastion Jhalawar.        
	Rahul has said he wants to change Indias politics to allow youth without political patronage to emerge as potential leaders of the country.        
	Just because I am the outcome of a system doesnt mean I cannot change it, he said.        
	If the just-ended Lok Sabha elections are any indication, changing this system may prove hard even for Rahul Gandhi.

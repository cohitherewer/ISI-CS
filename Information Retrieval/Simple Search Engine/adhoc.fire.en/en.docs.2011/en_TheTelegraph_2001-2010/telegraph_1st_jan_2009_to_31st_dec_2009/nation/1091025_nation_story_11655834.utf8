	Cha-Am Hua Hin (Thailand), Oct. 24 (Agencies): India and China today agreed to work towards narrowing their border differences but skirted the controversy over Arunachal Pradesh, the Northeast state over which the neighbours have sparred in recent weeks.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his Chinese counterpart Wen Jiabao, who met on the sidelines of an Asean-India Summit in Thailand, also agreed to try and ensure peace in the border, Chinas state-run news agency Xinhua reported.        
	N. Ravi, secretary (east) in Indias ministry of external affairs, told reporters that Wen concurred with Singh that bilateral issues should be properly handled through discussion.        
	The two leaders met in the backdrop of recent recriminations over Arunachal, parts of which China claims as its own, but did not discuss the state.        
	The neighbours agreed to continue talks with the aim of removing barriers to a solution that was fair and acceptable to both.        
	The two sides agreed to continue talks, with the aim of incrementally removing the barriers to a solution that was fair and acceptable to both sides, Xinhua said. They agreed to gradually narrow differences on border issues, the Chinese agency added.        
	At the hour-long talks with Wen, Singh underscored the importance for both sides to build better understanding and trust at the political level so that our relations remain robust and strong, Indias foreign ministry said in a statement.        
	Differences should not impede the growth of functional cooperation between the two countries, it said.        
	Wen, who described Singh as an old friend, said it was important India and China lived in harmony and friendship.        
	We want to have a healthy and steady relationship with India, he said.        
	Wen referred to Singhs comment that both countries had enough space to develop and cooperate and said there were sufficient areas in the world for India and China to enhance such cooperation.        
	This serves the interests of the two countries, the region and the world, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Taslima set for India in visa bid
                                                                                                               Taslima set for India in visa bid
          A STAFF REPORTER                           Taslima                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 4: Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasreen is expected reach Delhi tomorrow to apply for the renewal of her Indian visa, which expires on August 17.         
	She wants to live in Calcutta. Thats why she is returning to India, said a source close to the exiled author.         
	Taslima has been living in New York since leaving Sweden where she was offered refuge last year. She left Calcutta in November 2007 after a controversy over her book Dwikhandito.        
	The last time she came to India was in February when she was asked to stay away till May 31 because of the elections.         
	Taslima is not too keen on going back to New York. Once her visa is granted she hopes to stay in India and, if possible, return to Calcutta, the source said.         
	But returning to Calcutta will be easier said than done as the ruling Left is unlikely to want to antagonise the minority community, especially after the recent drubbing in the polls and the erosion of Muslim support.         
	As of now we have not received any intimation about Taslima planning to come to Calcutta. We are not even aware of her plans of coming to India. Things are still in a very sensitive state in Calcutta and we think the government will not risk taking a chance by allowing her here, said a senior Calcutta police official.

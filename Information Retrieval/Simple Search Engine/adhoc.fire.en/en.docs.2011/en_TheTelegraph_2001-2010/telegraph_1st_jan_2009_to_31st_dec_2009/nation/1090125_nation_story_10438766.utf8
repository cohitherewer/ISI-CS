	New Delhi, Jan. 24: Sonia Gandhis handling of the circumstances arising out of the Prime Ministers hospitalisation has ensured that the balance of power in neither the ruling dispensation nor the Congress was disturbed.        
	By keeping Pranab Mukherjees position ambivalent, she adhered to the letter and spirit of the Constitution which does not allow for a position such as a caretaker Prime Minister or an officiating Prime Minister. In the process, she also stopped the wheels of the rumour mills.        
	Hours after Sonia learnt that Singhs condition was more serious than it was thought to be, she was faced with several options such as formalising Mukherjees status as a de jure Number Two and reposing in him the rights and duties of the Prime Minister or running the government through a collective leadership.        
	She rejected these options, apparently put forth by a set of advisers, and framed her own model whose underpinning was getting the right balance of power in the Congress and the UPA.        
	Mukherjee was elevated, but just so because any suggestion that he would be a deputy Prime Minister would have been detrimental to the Congresss internal equations and confounded the leadership scenario in the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls.        
	Finance was something close to Mukherjees heart. On Wednesday, she made him the president of the Bengal Congress and gave him a free hand to run the party in the state.        
	But many impatient souls in the cabinet and the Congress Working Committee were relieved to note that Mukherjee was not moved to the exclusive orbit consisting of Sonia, Singh and Rahul Gandhi.        
	These leaders are expected to be projected as a triumvirate of mascots in the Lok Sabha polls  Singh as the Prime Minister in whose hands the country would be safe, Sonia as the builder of coalitions and the reconciler of contradictions for whom power means nothing and Rahul as the young face.        
	Sources said aware that Mukherjee was too senior and useful to the party and the government, Sonia took care to see he was not undermined in any way. She and the Prime Minister decided to hand over the finance portfolio to him, if only temporarily.        
	These sources said home minister P. Chidambaram was ready to present the vote-on-account in Parliament and was looking at the papers carefully in the belief he would hold charge of the finance ministry till such time the Prime Minister was declared medically fit. The sources said Sonia was convinced that home was too critical a portfolio to get divided attention.        
	Congress sources noted that Chidambaram was not present at a meeting of the manifesto committee of which he is a member. Mukherjee heads this committee.        
	Treasurer Motilal Vora told The Telegraph: I waited at the porch to receive Chidambaram but I dont know why he didnt show up. The three-hour meeting was held at the Congress headquarters.         
	At another level, Sonia has taken into account that the framers of the Constitution had envisaged a particular role for the countrys Vice-President. While Hamid Ansari has been given ceremonial responsibilities, the Congress president has confined political assignments to cabinet ministers.

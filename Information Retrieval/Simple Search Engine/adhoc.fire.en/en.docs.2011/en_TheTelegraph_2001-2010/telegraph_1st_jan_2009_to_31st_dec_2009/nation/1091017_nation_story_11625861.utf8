          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Kokrajhar, Oct. 16: An official from Andhra Pradesh was kidnapped at gunpoint by suspected militants from the East-West corridor project site in Kokrajhar this morning.        
	P. Krishna Rao, the project manager of Gayatri East Coast Insulation which is a private company, was supervising work at Karigaon Joypur, about 25km from the Bodoland Territorial Council headquarters in Kokrajhar town, when he was taken away by motorcycle-borne youths.         
	Kokrajhar is in lower Assam, 220km from Dispur.        
	The militants fired three rounds in the air when workers at the construction site tried to resist them.         
	Rao, who hails from Krishna district in Andhra Pradesh, had been staying in Chirang, also in lower Assam, with his wife and two children for the past three years.         
	The National Democratic Front of Boroland, which has a strong presence in Kokrajhar, is fighting for statehood. The police, though, has not named any outfit.        
	This is the second incident when an official of the construction company has been kidnapped from the Bodoland Territorial Council area.         
	In July 2008, three persons  an engineer, a contractor and a mason  were abducted by unidentified youths from Chirang district.         
	They were, however, released later after the company allegedly paid the ransom demanded by a militant group.                           
	Although police refused to name any militant outfit in the abduction today, a faction of the NDFB is under the scanner.

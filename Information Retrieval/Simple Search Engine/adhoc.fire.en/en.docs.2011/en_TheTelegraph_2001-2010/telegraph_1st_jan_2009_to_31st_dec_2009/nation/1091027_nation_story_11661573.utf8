                                                                                                               PC rebukes Maoist pals
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            Chidambaram      
	New Delhi, Oct. 26: The home ministry today cited a specific instance of Maoist violence to rebuke those who speak on their behalf and chastise the government.        
	The statement did not name anyone but sources said the target was Left intellectuals, such as those criticising the arrest and denial of bail to alleged CPI (Maoist) politburo member Khobad Ghandy.        
	P. Chidambarams ministry condemned yesterdays landmine blast that killed four CISF men in Chhattisgarh and said: What is the motive behind the attack on a police force that provides security to the NMDC (National Mineral Development Corporation)? What is the message that the (Maoists) intend to convey?        
	These are questions that we would like to put not only to the CPI (Maoist) but also to those who speak on their behalf and chastise the government. We think that it is time for all right-thinking citizens who believe in democracy and development to condemn the acts of violence perpetrated by the CPI (Maoist).        
	 Chidambaram has been highlighting the Maoist faith in violence to those favouring a softer stand and dialogue, such as the Citizens Initiative for Peace.         
	The home minister wrote to former Lok Sabha Speaker Rabi Ray, who is involved with the group, that the only hurdle to talks was the Maoist violence.                           
	He mentioned recent statements by rebel leaders Ganapathy and Kishanji justifying violence and armed struggle.

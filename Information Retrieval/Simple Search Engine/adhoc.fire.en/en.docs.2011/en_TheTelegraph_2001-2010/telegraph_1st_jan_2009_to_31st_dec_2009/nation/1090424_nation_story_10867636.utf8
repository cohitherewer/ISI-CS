	New Delhi, April 23: Students and parents today screamed for justice for Akriti Bhatia, 17, who died after an asthma attack in school on Monday.        
	At a news conference in Modern School, Vasant Vihar, called by the management to explain their position, the parents demanded principal Goldy Malhotras resignation for alleged negligence.        
	Akritis mother Anu Bhatia got into a scuffle with the principal and demanded that she be put behind bars. Goldy Malhotra should resign and be put behind bars, the mother cried.        
	The Class XII student had died an hour after she complained of breathlessness. Akriti had to wait for her car to arrive from home to take her to hospital, a delay that her parents say proved fatal. The school is also accused of taking back the oxygen mask it had given the gasping student as she was being put in her car.         
	There are so many cars parked in the school. The principal, too, has one. Why were they waiting for ambulance? Goldy Malhotra is the most inhuman principals I have ever seen. She should resign, a mother yelled.        
	The Delhi government has ordered an inquiry. The school has decided to form its own probe committee.        
	She (Goldy Malhotra) killed my friend. Does she have any answer why the oxygen mask was removed from Akriti when she was battling for life? Does she have any answer why an ambulance could not be arranged for Akriti? an angry student screamed.        
	Many protesters, including students of other Delhi schools, gathered outside the gates shouting slogans.        
	Malhotra denied negligence.        
	Anu screamed: I will go to the police, court, to get justice. I am a woman. The chief minister (Sheila Dikshit) is a woman, (Congress chief) Sonia Gandhi is a woman, the President of the country is a woman. I will go all the way.         
	Ashok Pratap Singh, the schools managing trustee, didnt apologise or answer specific allegations but promised to improve the medical facilities on the campus.         
	Shanno report        
	Delhi police today received the post-mortem report of Shanno, the schoolgirl who died after she was allegedly thrashed by her teacher and forced to stand in the sun with bricks on her shoulders.         
	The post-mortem report had suggested that there is no external injury. It also noted that epileptic seizure could be the reason behind the death of the girl. But a final call can be taken only after the viscera report, deputy commissioner of police Atul Katiyar said.

	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 28: A day after Union commerce and industry minister Anand Sharma unveiled an incentive-based export policy, Orissa today promptly responded by getting down on the business of exploring the export prospects of agro and processed food products.        
	There is ample scope for export in agro and processed food products sector, said industries minister Raghunath Mohanty. The government is emphasising on establishment of food processing industries and has promised incentives for them, taking into account the export and employment potential of the sector, he said. A draft state food processing policy has been formulated after extensive consultations and is currently under consideration of the government, he said.        
	Orissa has exported processed food products worth Rs 410.33 crore and Rs 393.12 crore during 2006-07 and 2007-08.

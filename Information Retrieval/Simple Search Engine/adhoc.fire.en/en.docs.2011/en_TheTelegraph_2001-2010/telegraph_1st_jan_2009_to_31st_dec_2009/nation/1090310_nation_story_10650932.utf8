The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cheer Knights, out of den
                                                                                                               Cheer Knights, out of den
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                          Shah Rukh at an IPL match at Eden Gardens                                  
	Mumbai, March 9: Fans of Sourav Ganguly and his Knight Riders may well start planning for a trip beyond Calcutta to cheer the boys.        
	Government officials and the IPL management were tight-lipped on the revised schedule sent to the home ministry and how many matches each team would have to play at neutral centres.        
	But sources said the Calcutta team, owned by actor Shah Rukh Khan and friends, may have to play a match or two either at Cuttack or at one of the seven neutral venues.        
	Vadodara, Dharamsala, Nagpur, Cuttack, Ahmedabad, Visakhapatnam and Indore are said to be the new centres in addition to the eight home cities. Visakhapatnam, which was selected in the first schedule as a catchment centre of the Hyderabad Deccan Chargers, will now be considered a neutral venue.         
	Cricket administrators expressed surprise at the choice of some venues. Whos going to go and watch a match at Dharamsala? asked an official with a state cricketing association. He also pointed out that Vadodara lacked floodlights, which meant it could only host a day match.        
	Kolkata Knight Riders sources said they were not too happy about playing in Cuttack as the Barabati Stadium could accommodate only around 33,000 people, a far cry from the Eden with a capacity of over 90,000.        
	Also, Cuttack lacks five-star accommodation, which has been a quibble with visiting teams.         
	If we must, we would much rather play at some other centre where the capacity is more, which would mean greater gate receipts, said a KKR source.         
	The Sardar Patel Stadium at Motera, on the outskirts of Ahmedabad for example, can accommodate around 48,000 to 50,000 as can the spanking new Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium at Jamtha in Nagpur.        
	The franchisees, though, are still in the dark about the modalities of gate revenue collection and sharing at the neutral venues.        
	We have yet to see the revised schedule. As of now, we are happy that the IPL is on. Right now, no one is thinking about revenues and other nitty gritty. It is enough that the tournament is on track, said Jeet Banerjee, a sports management entrepreneur associated with KKR.        
	The concept of catchment areas is irrelevant in the current situation. So Cuttack may or may not be one of the neutral grounds where we play. We of course would like to play all our matches at the Eden if the dates do not clash, or can be tweaked.        
	Even media planners are worried about reports that several IPL fixtures originally slated for weekends have now been shifted to weekdays.        
	This is a major blow. Premium rates are paid by advertisers to broadcasters for weekend matches as they get the maximum eyeballs. Adspots for most matches have been sold out on Sony (the official broadcaster). A change in the dates means an advertiser will pay weekend rates for a weekday match which will have low television ratings as well. There will have to be some renegotiations, said a media planner.        
	Royal request        
	The Rajasthan government has requested the IPL management to bring back the inaugural ceremony to Jaipur and promised all cooperation and security. The inauguration has been shifted to Mumbai.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Srinagar, Oct. 2: The Border Security Force killed two militants trying to sneak into Jammu last night during a fresh infiltration bid that suggested no let-up in efforts to violate the International Border by Pakistan-based rebel groups.        
	BSF sources said the bid was foiled after they challenged a group of militants who were trying to negotiate the border fence at Mangral outpost in R.S. Pura.        
	This was the fourth infiltration bid on the International Border in the last three weeks. The sources said there was firing from across the border, apparently by Rangers, Pakistans border guards.        
	The exchange of fire continued for some time. After the firing stopped, the BSF troopers found two bodies which were lying close to the border fence, a source said.        
	J.B. Sangwan, BSF deputy inspector-general, Jammu frontier, said troops retaliated after firing from across the border. We are lodging a strong protest (with Pakistani Rangers) against this firing, he said.        
	Official sources said the last infiltration bid was on September 17 when two BSF troops were injured in the Nikowal area of Akhnoor. Before that, two more bids were reported in four preceding days, signifying the impatience of the militants to send more infiltrators into the state to foment trouble.        
	Militant infiltration bids apart, Pakistani troops have been blamed for violating the ceasefire on the 1,086km Line of Control, International Border and the Actual Ground Position Line dividing the two Kashmirs.        
	Militants have recently stepped up attacks on secu-rity forces in Jammu and Kashmir after a months of relative calm.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      A pistol seized after the   arrest. (PTI)
                          
	Mumbai, Nov. 12: The anti-terrorist squad (ATS) has arrested a young man from Uttar Pradesh with a reasonably large cache of arms, the operation touching a raw nerve in the city force which has been often hampered by differences within.        
	Kailash Singh, a 28-year-old man from Uttar Pradesh, was arrested from a busy locality in suburban Chembur on the basis of a tip-off received by the ATS this morning.        
	He was carrying one carbine, 10 revolvers and 68 cartridges, ATS chief K.P. Raghuvanshi told reporters at a hurriedly called news conference.        
	Raghuvanshi, who took charge of the ATS after Hemant Karkare fell to the 26/11 terrorists, said preliminary interrogation had revealed that Singh was not connected to any militant group.        
	He seems to be just another criminal involved in gun-running. He was to deliver the arms to a city contact. He will be in our custody till November 18, Raghuvanshi said.        
	Though it was quick to downplay any terror angle, the ATS is still to figure out who the arms were meant for.        
	The arrest of Singh has again brought to the surface the simmering tension between the crime branch and the ATS, the two wings expected to shield Mumbai. The two have often accused one another of stepping on each others toes, a rift that created serious issues during 26/11.        
	Crime branch sources said with the political temperature in Mumbai rising following the fracas in the Assembly between two political parties over language, the arms could also have been meant for use of fringe elements planning violence.        
	If the man is just a petty criminal, why did the ATS act on the tip-off? They should have let us know about it and we would have carried out the operation. It was not their area at all. Besides, with the city under high alert before the 26/11 anniversary, there is more scrutiny as far as security checks and information collating is concerned, said a top crime branch official.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Prasad in quit-spree
                                                                                                               Prasad in quit-spree
                            
	New Delhi, Jan. 13 (PTI): T.R. Prasad, a former cabinet secretary and an independent director of the disbanded board of Satyam, has resigned from the boards of GMR Infrastructure, Delhi International Airport Ltd, TVS Motor Company and a castings firm called Nelcast.        
	He (Prasad) has resigned from the board of GMR Infrastructure because of personal reasons, a spokesperson for the group said.        
	Repeated attempts to contact Prasad failed.        
	B. Ramalinga Raju, the tainted founder of Satyam, while disclosing his Rs 7,800-crore financial fraud, identified Prasad as one of the persons well placed to mobilise support from the government at this crucial time.        
	In the middle of the controversy surrounding the aborted Satyam-Maytas deal, Prasad had insisted that the board then had given only an in-principle, not the final, approval.

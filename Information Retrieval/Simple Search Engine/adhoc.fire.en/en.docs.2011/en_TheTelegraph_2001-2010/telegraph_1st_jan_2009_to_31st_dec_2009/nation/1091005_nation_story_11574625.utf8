                                                                                                               Caste war threatens Nitish vote base
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Ram Vilas Paswan in Amausi-Bahiyar after the Friday attack                                  
	Patna, Oct. 4: The war between the Kurmi-Koiris and the Mahadalits (Musahars) that left 16 persons dead in north Bihars Khagaria district has apparently created a piquant situation for chief minister Nitish Kumar.        
	The victims belong to Kurmi-Koiri communities, which constitute the nucleus of Nitishs political strength. And the perpetrators are Mahadalits (lowly among the Scheduled Castes) whom Nitish has been trying to win over by initiating several developmental measures for them.        
	His chief opponents  Ram Vilas Paswan and Lalu Prasad  have consistently been attacking Nitish for dividing the Scheduled Castes for his political gains.         
	Now, Nitish faces the wrath of his own caste  Kurmis and Koiries training their guns on him with the Musahars using rebel might to massacre 16 people  14 Kurmis and two Koiries.        
	Nitish constituted a Mahadalit Commission in 2006. He also announced the settlement of garmazrua (government) and ceiling surplus lands to the Mahadalits. Nitish has also announced that the government would provide land to the Mahadalits for building houses.        
	In fact, officials, including additional district magistrate Jharilal Sardar and Amausi panchayats land revenue clerk Ramesh Das, who are under the police scanner for their role have added to Nitishs troubles by acting over-enthusiasm.        
	Top police sources said that Sardar and Das issued parcha (land possession receipt) to landless Musahars for the lands, which the Kurmis and Koiries had purchased from upper caste people 25 years ago.

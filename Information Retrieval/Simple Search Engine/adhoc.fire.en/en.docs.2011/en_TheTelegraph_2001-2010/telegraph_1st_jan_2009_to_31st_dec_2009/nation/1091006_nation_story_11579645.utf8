The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitish for state role in river plan
                                                                                                               Nitish for state role in river plan
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Oct. 5: Though he welcomed the Centres declaration of the Ganga as a national river, chief minister Nitish Kumar doubted the capacity of the proposed framework to clean the river and ensure regular pollution check.        
	The proposed framework needs re-examination. The implementation of the projects has to be undertaken primarily at the state level. There is a need for institutional structure and capacity building in the states, said Nitish, who attended the meeting on cleaning chaired by the Prime Minister.        
	He said there was no proposal for building the infrastructure and capacity at the state level in the central proposal to clean the Ganga.         
	The Centre should provide the financial and professional assistance to the state to involve it in the mega project, he said.        
	Nitish pointed out that the process of approval of the projects was too lengthy and cumbersome. The state-level executive committee with representation from empowered steering committee can be delegated with powers to approve projects upto Rs 50 crore.        
	As the National Ganga River Basin Authority projects would have wide implications related to ecology of the basin, he suggested, the Centre should fully fund all projects.         
	He added out that the proposed cost-sharing pattern of 70:30 was not appropriate in view of the limited resources of the states.

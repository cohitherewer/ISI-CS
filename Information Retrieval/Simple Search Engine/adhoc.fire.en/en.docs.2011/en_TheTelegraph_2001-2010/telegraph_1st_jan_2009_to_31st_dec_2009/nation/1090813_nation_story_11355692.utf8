The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | 26/11 justice a priority: US
                                                                                                               26/11 justice a priority: US
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Roemer in New Delhi (AFP)                          
	New Delhi, Aug. 12: New US ambassador Timothy Roemer today said ensuring justice in last Novembers Mumbai attack was a high priority for President Barack Obama, in the strongest remarks from Washington in recent months amid Indias complaints of tardy Pakistani probe.        
	The diplomat, who presented his credentials to President Pratibha Patil yesterday, called for greater co-operation between the two countries on battling a common enemy besides firming up their strategic partnership.        
	We intend to announce some of the most tangible results of our partnership this November, when Prime Minister (Manmohan) Singh travels to Washington for an official visit. The Prime Minister has invited President Obama to visit India, too, and we are all looking forward to that visit, he said in his first interaction with the media in the capital.        
	But it was his comments on the Mumbai probe that set the tone for the news conference as Roemer said the US would keep pressing Islamabad for action against the brains behind the attack.        
	Al Qaida, the Taliban, Lashkar-e-Toiba... we have a common enemy with India. And we are pressing Pakistan hard on the Mumbai suspects, Roemer, who served on the commission to investigate the 9/11 attacks, said.        
	So this is a high priority for the President (Obama) and a high priority for the government to work with India on these efforts and to bring the perpetrators of this brutal attack, this blood-thirsty attack on Mumbai, to justice.        
	Told that Pakistan claims there isnt enough proof against Lashkar founder Hafiz Saeed despite the evidence Delhi has submitted against the alleged mastermind of the attack, Roemer said the perpetrators should be brought to justice, including everyone you mentioned.        
	Roemer, who also dwelt on issues like energy and climate change, education, development, economics and technology, said the US-India relationship was very important for Americas future.         
	He outlined the main features of the strategic dialogue announced at the end of secretary of state Hillarys Clintons visit last month and emphasised Washingtons intention to advance the robust agenda.        
	We plan to move from the good work done and the goodwill earned between our countries over the past decade to build a truly global partnership addressing both our nations top concerns and promises of better health for our childrens futures.        
	 Roemer said before he left for India, Obama spoke warmly and respectfully about the Indian Prime Minister.         
	In fact, when we had this discussion at the White House, the President touched his heart and he said, You make sure that you extend my heartfelt wishes to the Prime Minister and his health, Roemer said.

          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	Bhopal, June 13: With most of Madhya Pradesh reeling under a water crisis, the chief minister has sought divine intervention to bring rain to the parched state.        
	Shivraj Singh Chauhan is organising soma yagnas to please Varun Dev, the rain god, with the help of Maharashtra-based Veda Vigyan Ashram, local NGOs and the state-run Madhya Pradesh Council of Science and Technology.        
	Several lakh rupees of taxpayers money is being spent to organise the rituals.         
	In 2007, the state spent Rs 64 lakh to sponsor a study on the efficacy of the ritual in bringing rain.         
	The project  Verification of the Rain-Induction Techniques from the Vedas for Social Advantage  was undertaken by the science and technology council and Shivpuri-based NGO Gangachal Shiksha Samiti.         
	The Samiti had organised yagnas at Panna, Tikamgarh and Chattarpur districts.        
	This time, in addition to the Samiti, the state has sought the services of Somaji Nana Kale who runs the Sholapur-based Veda Vigyan Ashram.         
	According to Somaji, soma yagna was used to bring rain since time immemorial. We have already collected data of four such yagnas and it is being analysed, he said, adding that the project team from the council had included many meteorologists and physicists.        
	A close aide of Chauhan justified the need for the yagnas. In Saddam Hussains Iraq, there used to be a national prayer day for rain where special namaaz used to be organised, the bureaucrat said.        
	The water crisis in many parts of the state has spiralled out of control. In Bhopal, water is supplied in most areas once in two days. In Ujjain, water is available once a week.        
	Water scarcity has led to bloody feuds, too. Recently, three members of a family in the state capital died in a scuffle over water. Jeevan Malviya, 42, wife Sita and son Raju were killed after they tried to draw water from a leaky municipal water supply line in the old part of the capital city.        
	The Bhopal Municipal Corporation tankers are accompanied by guards during water distribution.         
	In nearby Dewas district, the administration has barred gatherings along the 122km Nemawar water supply line and imposed Section 144 after several cases of water pilferage were reported. Cops now guard the length of the pipeline.

                                                                                                               Orissa mourns seer death peacefully
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 13: The first death anniversary of VHP leader Swami Laxmananda Saraswati passed off peacefully today at Kandhamal and elsewhere.         
	The seer and his four disciples were killed by a group of assailants at an ashram in Jelespeta (Kandhamal) on the day of Janmashtami in 2008, sparking violence across the state. The Sangh Parivar had planned to observe the anniversary as sacrifice day, causing apprehension of the possibility of tension.         
	Security measures were beefed up in Kandhamal today. No incidents were, however, reported, said inspector-general (law) Arun Kumar Sarangi talking to The Telegraph this afternoon. Sarangi, who is now camping at Kandhamal, said 53 platoons of State Armed Police Force, a company of Central Reserve Police Force, nine platoons of Orissa Special Striking Force and India Reserve Battalion and 18 platoons each of Special Police Officers and Orissa Special Armed Police were deployed.         
	The administration had banned all rallies and processions on this day.         
	People observed the sad day at the villages instead of participating in the silent rally proposed by the VHP, said the director-general of police, M.M. Praharaj, who also visited the district.         
	However, religious functions were held in the ashrams at Jalespeta and at Chakapada, where the seer and his associates were cremated.         
	More than 2,000 devotees assembled there said Swami Sachiddananda Saraswati.         
	Maoist posters warning Hindus to refrain from observing the Saraswatis death were found in Raikia, Paburia, Tumudibandh, Daringibadi and Kotgarh areas of the district. However, police suspect that the posters were not pasted by Maoists. It appears to be the handiwork of mischievous elements, said IG Sarangi.         
	VHP activists did stage a silent dharna in front of the Raj Bhavan. A delegation also met Governor M.C. Bhandare and handed over a memorandum. A year has elapsed since Swami Laxmanandas murder. But neither the killers nor the conspirators have been apprehended yet, despite a written assurance by chief minister Naveen Patnaik, said a delegation member.         
	Referring to the posters, the memorandum alleged: Members of a particular community pretending to be Maoists have been creating law and order problems in Kandhamal and nearby areas.         
	While the posters caused panic among the Hindus, VHPs proposal to hold a sacrifice day sparked off fear among the minority community that had borne the brunt of last years riots. Thank God, there was no violence. Christians are still living in fear in Kandhamal and elsewhere, said archbishop Rapheal Cheenath.

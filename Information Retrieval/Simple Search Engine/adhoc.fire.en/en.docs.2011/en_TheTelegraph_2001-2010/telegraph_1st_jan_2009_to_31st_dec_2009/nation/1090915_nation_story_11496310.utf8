	New Delhi, Sept. 14: The BJPs spell of electoral drought was mitigated a bit today when it put up a good showing in Assembly by-elections in Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand.        
	The BJP, which rules the three states, wrested five Assembly seats from the Congress in Gujarat and won one each in Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand.        
	Sources said the leg-up was what the BJP needed to fight next months Maharashtra elections at a time the central leadership is in tatters.        
	The rise in the prices of essentials in the middle of drought-like conditions is being seen as one of the reasons for the Congress setback.        
	BJP sources said the Congresss reverses in the elections held after its May victory  the Delhi municipal polls, bypolls in Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka and the latest round  suggested that the aura around Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi was beginning to wane.        
	BJP leaders also found solace in the fact that despite the disorder at the top, people are still voting for the party in direct contests with the Congress. However, they conceded that Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand were essentially bipolar states that swung between the Congress and the BJP.        
	Some leaders sought to link the victory to the recent events in Gujarat such as the ban on Jaswant Singhs book and the controversy over alleged fake encounter killings, claiming that chief minister Narendra Modis stand had been vindicated.        
	After the Lok Sabha let-down, Modi, thought to be a prime ministerial prospective, was out of the national radar screen.         
	In the discourse on a generational change, Modi has been edged out by his regional peers, Shivraj Singh Chauhan and Raman Singh and even by the comparatively less known Manohar Parrikar of Goa.        
	Modis decision to ban Jaswants book on Jinnah for allegedly denigrating Sardar Vallabhai Patel was roundly criticised by many as another manifestation of his disrespect for democratic principles.        
	At the chintan baithak in Shimla last month, it was Modi who pushed the leaders to expel Jaswant. His contention was the bypoll seats were mostly in the Patel-dominated areas and the BJP would lose them if it did not crack the whip on Jaswant.        
	BJP sources cited the win in Jasdan, a seat the Congress never lost since Independence, as evidence of how the anti-Modi tide was checked.         
	The Congresss flip-flop on an affidavit filed by the Union home ministry in Gujarat High Court on the killing of Ishrat Jahan and other Muslims was shown up as another example of how unless parties played straight shots on communally divisive issues, they were doomed to fall.         
	The home ministrys affidavit said Ishrat and the others were Lashkar-e-Toiba activists, based on Web information, while the law ministry said it wanted to correct a perceived subversion of the judicial process and said it would want to probe whether those shot in the police encounter were part of the Lashkar or not.         
	In Uttarakhand, the decision to replace B.C. Khanduri, who led the 2009 Lok Sabha campaign, with Ramesh Pokhriyal helped the BJP recoup and take on the Congress.

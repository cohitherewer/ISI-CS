	Bhubaneswar, April 1: BJP leader and its prime ministerial candidate LK Advani today ruled out the possibility of any post-poll alliance with former coalition partner BJD.        
	I dont see any possibility, after all that has happened, Advani told a news conference here today referring to the break in the 11-year alliance. BJD has not only betrayed BJP, but the people of Orissa who do not want Congress misrule to return, he added. The decade-long BJD-BJP alliance in Orissa was the most stable anti-Congress alliance in the history, he said, and added experiments of launching regional parties had not lasted long in the state.         
	When Naveens allegation of BJPs hidden communal agenda was drawn to his notice, Advani said the though seat-sharing talks went on for several days, no communal issues were ever raised.         
	Only thing he (Naveen) had said was that the BJP should contest from five Lok Sabha seats, while we had seven MPs. That shows that he had decided to go alone this time right at the onset, Advani said.         
	Even before, we successfully converted such challenges into opportunities. It would be our earnest endeavour to convert this crisis into opportunity as we did in Karnataka, he said.         
	Advani appealed to the people of Orissa to express their disapproval of betrayal and at the same time shatter Congresss dream of coming to power both at the Centre and the state.         
	I assure the people of Orissa that the future NDA government, if elected, will assist Orissa in overcoming the legacy of poverty and backwardness that the Congress has awarded them, he promised.         
	With the first phase of election 16 days away, the veteran said that the electorate can clearly see the contrast between the NDA and the UPA governance.         
	While the UPA has disintegrated to a point where it has ceased to exist as a pre-poll alliance, the BJP has gained three more allies in the first three months, he pointed out. Asked as to how many seats BJP will win this time, he said, I am expecting better results.

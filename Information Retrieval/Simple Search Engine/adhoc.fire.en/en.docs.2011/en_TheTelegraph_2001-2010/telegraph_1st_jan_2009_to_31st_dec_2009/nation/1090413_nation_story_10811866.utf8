          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, April 12: The Nandan Kanan zoological park is frequented by more tourists than the Sun Temple of Konark.        
	Last fiscal, the zoo was visited by 1,860,702 visitors  an all-time high in the history of Nandankanan.         
	The collection of revenue also touched an all-time high of Rs 23,600,000. Last year, the number was 1,730,887. The footfalls counted exceed to that of the Sun temple that received 1,300,000 visitors this year.        
	Despite the economic downturn and twin floods that kept Orissa cutting off railway tracks and road communications, Nandan Kanan has witnessed a record number of visitors. This is a clear indication that Nandan Kanan is becoming more popular day by day and one of the most preferred destinations in Orissa, said zoo director Ajit Patnaik.        
	The zoo authorities have been stressing on visitors amenities like safe drinking water by way of providing cool filtered chlorinated water at several water kiosks.         
	A six acre meadow has specially been developed at a centrally located place.         
	Besides, adequate sitting arrangement, trashcans and toilets have been provided for visitors to relax. More than 150 benches were recently installed under the shady tree and 2.5km of paved path constructed along the enclosures for the differently abled persons.        
	Stand-off barriers have been constructed covering all the enclosures making it safe both for animals and the visitors. This provides the park a greener look, said the director. To make the park more attractive for the visitors, an ultra modern aquarium, an elephant enclosure, and an aviary for the vulture and Brahminy Kite have been constructed.         
	Also the ambitious animal exchange programme has started from this year, added Patnaik.

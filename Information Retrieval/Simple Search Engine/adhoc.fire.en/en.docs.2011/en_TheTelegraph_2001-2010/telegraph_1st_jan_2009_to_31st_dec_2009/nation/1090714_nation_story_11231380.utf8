          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, July 13: The body of a 30-year-old man was found in the Jamuna well of Jagannath temple today.         
	Devotees spotted the body floating in the 100 ft well and raised an alarm.        
	The deceased was identified as Tapan Panda, a small-time trader of temple supplies, hailing from Jagatsinghpur, who was staying in Puri with his family.        
	My husband did not return home last night. I came to know of his death this morning. We had no family problems and he had no enemies, said Subhasini, Pandas wife.        
	We suspect that Panda was murdered and so the case demands a thorough probe. His body also bore injury signs, said Biswanath Panda, a temple sevayat.         
	However, neither the family nor the temple sevayats have lodged an official complaint with the police yet.        
	Police believe that Pandas death may have been accidental.         
	It seems that he was fetching water from the well when he slipped. He suffered a head injury that might have happened after he fell and hit his head. We have sent the body for post-mortem and a clear picture will be available only after the results come in, said Singhadwar inspector-in-charge Arun Kumar Dalei.         
	This was the second death in the temple in couple of months. A woman had earlier committed suicide inside the temple premises.         
	The temple rituals were delayed for a few hours due to the incident. The bada mahasnana (purification ritual) was performed to cleanse the sanctum sanctorum.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Security alert to Buddha 
                                                                                                               Security alert to Buddha 
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                               
	New Delhi, April 1: The Centre has urged leaders to take precautions and co-operate with security personnel following inputs that 40 politicians, including Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, are targets of terror groups and Naxalites.        
	The advisory is in the form of a letter Union home minister P. Chidambaram wrote on March 27, saying the leaders should take adequate measures, cooperate with security forces and share tour programmes and movement plans with central and state authorities during the election period.        
	The threat from the Maoists is high in Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Orissa, the letter has said, adding the risk of strikes by Pakistan-based outfits is already omnipresent, more so after the attack on Mumbai in November last year.        
	Other than Bengal chief minister Bhattacharjee, the list includes defence minister A.K. Antony. Sources said the home ministry had written to the Kerala police chief to tighten security ahead of the defence ministers visit to his native state this week.         
	The ministry has taken steps to alert and sensitise the state governments responsible for the security of these (40) leaders in their areas, a ministry official said.         
	The sources did not specify if the list of 40 included Varun Gandhi  now in jail under the National Security Act after his alleged hate speech and arson by his supporters  who has sought more security, citing family history.        
	A PTI report said Varun wrote a letter to Chidambaram on March 20, asking for more security. In light of the current controversy (over the anti-Muslim speech), I would like to request that there be a review of the threat perception to me and my security status be accordingly upgraded, Varun wrote.         
	In view of the family history, I feel sure you will appreciate the gravity of the situation.        
	Chidambaram replied the same day, saying the matter would be looked into for appropriate action.

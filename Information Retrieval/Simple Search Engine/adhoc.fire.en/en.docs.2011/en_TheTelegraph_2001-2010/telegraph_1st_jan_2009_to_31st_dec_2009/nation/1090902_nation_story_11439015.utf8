          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Lt. Gen V.K. Singh                          
	New Delhi, Sept. 1: Northern army commander Lieutenant General P.C. Bhardwaj has been named the new vice-chief of army staff, sources said, sparking speculation he may be the next army chief superseding Eastern Command GoC-in-C Lt. Gen V.K. Singh.        
	Singh is the senior-most three-starred officer today, after army chief General Deepak Kapoor.        
	If the government goes by convention, the speculation is that just like Kapoor made it to the post of general after being vice-chief, Bhardwaj may become the next army chief, bypassing Singh.        
	As vice-chief, Bhardwaj will assume office on October 1, when incumbent Lt Gen Noble Thamburaj retires.        
	Convention also has it that the senior-most commander takes over as the vice-chief who would serve in office around six months before taking over as general. As the senior-most officer, Singh, too, would have served six months before taking over the reins, but so would Bhardwaj.        
	However, there are exceptions. Although the vice-chief is the first among equals, it is not necessary that only a vice-chief becomes the army chief as all commanders are considered equal, said a senior officer.

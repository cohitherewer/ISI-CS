          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               (Top) Jamir and Chavan				                                 
	Mumbai, Nov. 4: A gentle reminder from governor S.C. Jamir to respect the peoples mandate without further delay today sent chief minister Ashok Chavan scurrying to announce that his new cabinet would be sworn in within 48 hours.        
	Political developments gathered pace after a Shiv Sena-BJP delegation met the governor in the morning and demanded imposition of Presidents rule if the Congress-NCP combine failed to form a government within 24 hours.         
	The Opposition team, led by Subhash Desai of the Sena and Eknath Khadse of the BJP, said the caretaker government of Chavan should not be allowed to function for an indefinite period as several serious issues  among them malnutrition in tribal areas, declaration of prices for agricultural producers and law and order  were pending.         
	The governor told the delegation he was anxious to have an elected government installed as early as possible. He told them that he had reminded chief minister Ashok Chavan and NCP leaders Chhagan Bhujbal and R.R. Patil yesterday that it was their responsibility to respect the mandate and form a government without any further delay, a Raj Bhavan spokesperson said.         
	As the Sena-BJP team met Jamir, the chief minister presided over meetings to take stock of essential commodity prices and law and order.         
	I do not wish to comment on talks with the NCP as Praful Patel has already clarified things yesterday. I am confident that within 48 hours the new government would be in place. We will respect the governors wishes, he said.         
	Chavan said the decision on the power-sharing formula would be announced in New Delhi. NCP leaders Bhujbal, Patil and Ajit Pawar flew to the capital to attend an evening meeting at boss Sharad Pawars residence.

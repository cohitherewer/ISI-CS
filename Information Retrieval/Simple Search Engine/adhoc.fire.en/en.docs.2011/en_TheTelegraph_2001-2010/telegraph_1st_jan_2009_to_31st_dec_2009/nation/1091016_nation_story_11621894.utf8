	New Delhi, Oct. 15: India today announced it was renewing its strategic relationship with Russia and had decided to extend the military technical co-operation for 10 years from 2011, despite doubts over guaranteed support and the increasing offers of military assistance from the West.        
	Defence minister A.K. Antony, who is visiting Moscow, and Russian defence minister Anatoly Serdyukov concluded that military ties between India and Russia had evolved from a simple buyer-seller relationship to a broad-based partnership where both countries are involved in joint design, development and production of defence equipment.        
	Nearly 70 per cent of Indian military hardware is of erstwhile Soviet or Russian origin. But the two sides have failed to sort out the most contentious issue in India-Russia ties: the pricing of the aircraft carrier, the Admiral Gorshkov (which India has rechristened the INS Vikramaditya).        
	Delhi and Moscow have been renegotiating the price for the Gorshkov, contracted in 2004, for more than two years. Russia has also pushed back the delivery schedule by about four years.        
	The Indian defence establishment has been trying to persuade the Russians to scale down their demand for price escalation that nearly doubles the cost of the carrier. The price being worked on is between $2.2 billion (Rs 10, 150cr) and $2.9 billion (Rs 13,380cr).        
	The two defence ministers were the co-chairs of the ninth meeting of the India-Russia Inter-Governmental Commission on Military Technical Co-operation, the apex body that governs India-Russia military ties.        
	Antony said Russia was the only country with which India had an established multi-tiered mechanism for military co-operation.        
	Russia is a time-tested, dependable friend of India. Our special defence relationship with Russia will continue. The extension of our long-term defence co-operation programme till 2020 would include 31 new areas, PTI quoted Antony as saying.        
	The agreement to renew military-technical co-operation  which traces its roots to Indo-Soviet ties when Indira Gandhi was Prime Minister from 2011 to 2020 is likely to be signed during the scheduled visit by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to Moscow in December.        
	Defence ministry sources here said the two sides had also decided to sign an agreement on after-sales product support of Russian-origin defence equipment. This is a particularly sore point with the Indian armed forces, which frequently run out of spares and components in critical weapons systems.        
	The original manufacturers of most of the equipment are now widely dispersed but when India sourced them, they were under a common authority in the erstwhile Soviet Union.        
	Defence ministry sources said the two sides also reviewed the status for joint design and development of a Fifth Generation Fighter Aircraft and a Multi-Role Transport Aircraft. The sources said the Russians committed technical support and technology transfer for the production of T-90-S tanks and SU-30MKI fighter jets in India.

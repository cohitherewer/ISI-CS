	Srinagar, July 8: The hot seat is getting hotter for Omar Abdullah, the countrys youngest chief minister whose performance will also be a litmus test for the much vaunted babalog brigade.        
	The 39-year-old third-generation chief minister has been staring down the barrel ever since he dismissed the deaths of two Shopian women as a case of drowning, against popular perception that they were raped before being murdered by security forces.         
	The raging protests which began on May 30 have travelled from Shopian to other parts of the Kashmir valley with more killings at the hands of security forces in Srinagar and Baramulla adding fuel to the fire.         
	Srinagar was again on the boil today following the death of a student, Asrar Ahmad, at Maisuma in the city centre, the ubiquitous security forces the favourite suspects.        
	Todays death has got nothing to do with the prevalent situation. It appears to be a simple case of crime and the forces are not involved, a senior police officer said.        
	But that has done little to calm tempers with people willing to protest over almost everything.         
	Kashmir watchers are, however, still willing to give Omar a chance. The situation is such that things would have been no different had Omars father Farooq or (rival) Mufti Mohammad Sayeed been at the helm. Omars inexperience, of course, is making things worse for him, said Sheikh Showkat, who teaches law at Kashmir University.        
	Showkat reasoned that the waning of militancy meant that the political leadership would have to find new ways of dealing with day-to-day tensions. Militancy has ebbed in Kashmir and that is proving a disadvantage for Omar. In war, they say, everything is possible. Security forces were free to use any means to curb violence. People would fear to raise their voice quite so often under such circumstances, the professor said. Now the guns of militants are silent and you cannot use similar techniques to curb mass uprisings.        
	The junior Omar took over the reins on January 5. For the initial few months, the going appeared smooth. When two youths were killed by the army early this year, Omar, contrary to what his father would have done, took a pro-people stand by agreeing to the demand to shift their camp from the civilian area.        
	Omars problems started soon after he addressed a news conference on June 3 in which he said initial reports suggested that the two women in Shopian died of drowning, a cover-up in public perception.         
	For the National Conference to regain the trust it once enjoyed, the punishment of the Shopian culprits is necessary. But, to Omars dismay, the judicial commission probing the deaths has so far not succeeded in nailing them.         
	Politics demands right statements at the right time. The chief minister may have the right intentions but he is failing on the delivery front. His predecessor (Mufti Mohammed Sayeed) would have never called a news conference to react over such a sensitive issue (Shopian). But Omar not only did that but even relied on the inputs that were fed to him by police or security agencies, a senior officer in the civil administration said.        
	The opposition Peoples Democratic Party has dubbed the government fascist. The loss of life and assault on dignity of the people in six months rule of Omar Abdullah has brought the state face to face with a new crisis, PDP general secretary Mohammad Dilawar Mir said.         
	Omars success or failure will now be a test case for any political heir-apparent looking to sustain dynastic rule.         
	The transition from father to son or daughter has never been smooth. It wasnt so when Indira Gandhi (the daughter of Jawaharlal Nehru) became Prime Minister (after Lal Bahadur Shastris death) or when Rajiv (Gandhi) followed Indira. They succeeded when they created their own constituencies and Omars success would lie in that, law professor Showkat said.

                                                                                    Saturday , November 14 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Sweet drought for apple farmers in Valley 
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                                     
	Srinagar, Nov. 13: Kashmirs apple growers are reaping the fruits of labour  thanks to a drought.        
	The state has witnessed a slump in production but record high prices have allowed the farmers not just to compensate losses from lower yields but also earn more.        
	The production of fruits in Kashmir was close to 14 lakh tonnes last year. It is 15 to 20 per cent less this time, G.H. Shah, the director of the state governments horticulture department, said.         
	But the output fall because of drought has pushed up prices by 40 per cent on average. Fruit growers are likely to earn Rs 2,500 crore, up from Rs 2,200 crore last year, Shah said.        
	Apples form more than 90 per cent of the fruit production in Kashmir, with pears, apricots, peach, cherry and grapes making up the rest of the basket.        
	The drought hit production in the Kandi (upper reaches) areas which depend on the rain. The impact wasnt much in the plains as these areas have irrigation facilities. In Kupwara and some other places, hailstorms did the damage.         
	But there was another reason for the price spurt: a sharp decline in apple production in neighbouring Himachal Pradesh. The loss in production in the past meant that we would suffer more as Himachal would supply when we couldnt.         
	But this year they (Himachal) have also suffered (from the drought), said Ghulam Rasool Bhat of the Apple Growers Association. Kashmir and Himachal are the two major apple producers in the country, but the Valley continues to top the list.        
	Bhat said a box of the American variety of apples had sold for Rs 300 last year. This time, we could sell them for Rs 500. Other varieties like the Delicious, Kesri and Hazratbali also commanded handsome prices, he said. In Kashmir, he added, some varieties fetched Rs 100 a kg, a price not seen in the Valley in years.        
	The drought has brought another gain: the production of almond, which needs dry weather, has soared.         
	Horticulture is Kashmirs mainstay, along with handicrafts and tourism. Three million people, over a third of the states population, live off it directly and indirectly.        
	The apple growers were at the forefront of last years agitation against the blockade of the Valley during the Amarnath land dispute by protestors in Jammu.         
	Unable to reach the markets across the country because of the agitation, the growers had tried to cross the LoC to sell their fruits in Pakistan-occupied Kashmirs Muzaffarabad before being stopped.

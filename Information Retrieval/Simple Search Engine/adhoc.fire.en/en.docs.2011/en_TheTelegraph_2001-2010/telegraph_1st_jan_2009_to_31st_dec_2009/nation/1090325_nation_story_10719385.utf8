The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Dance relief for victims
                                                                                                               Dance relief for victims
          PRIYA ABRAHAM                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 24: The stale routine of counselling followed by a stint in tailoring or knitting for rescued victims of trafficking and sexual abuse at shelter homes is a pass.        
	Inmates from different rescue homes in Orissa came together today for a new experience  to shake their legs to the tune of latest Bollywood numbers and shed away the blues.        
	Its a new experience. I had never danced before and was feeling shy in the beginning. But its good now. Im feeling more confident, laughed Droupadi, a teenager at Sanjeevani, one of the homes for rescued girls.        
	Victims of sexual abuse and trafficking would feel a lot more than just the trauma. But for the inmates at Sanjeevani, which roped in a dance therapy group sponsored by the American Center in Calcutta, was a welcome change.        
	Body movement, when used sensitively, can become a powerful tool for rehabilitation and advocacy. When performing, the survivors feel the freedom to express themselves in the way they wish to. The body, which has so far been abused, exploited, violated and objectified, is now transformed into a creative agent of expression and this makes an enormous positive impact on the survivors self-image. The therapeutic process transforms victims into bold and creative artistes, besides providing a platform to excel and recognise ones own potential, said Sohini Chakraborty, a sociologist and dance activist who led the team.        
	The team, Kolkata Sanved, which conducted the event, has developed techniques that use dance and movement as alternative approaches to traditional counselling.

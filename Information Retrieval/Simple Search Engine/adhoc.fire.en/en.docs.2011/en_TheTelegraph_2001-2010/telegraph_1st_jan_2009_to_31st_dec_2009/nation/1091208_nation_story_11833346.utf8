  - Bihar govt comes forward          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	Patna, Dec. 7: The state government has offered aid to Eqramul Hussein and Ali Hussein  two progeric brothers  after the Amitabh Bachchan-starrer Paa highlighted the rare ailment that fast accelerates the ageing process.        
	The government will help in their treatment and will also provide them with financial assistance, health minister Nandkishore Yadav said, adding: Officials concerned are working out the modalities of the aid to be given to the family and its members suffering from the disease.        
	The two progeric patients belong to Dumri village of Saran, also the constituency represented by RJD chief Lalu Prasad in the Lok Sabha.        
	The affected family had an extremely hard time before Paa highlighted the ailment and the media raised the issue linking Eqramul (22) and Ali (11) with the Bachchan-starrer.        
	Shekhar Chatterjee, a paediatrician from Calcutta, and his SB Devi Charity Home was the only source of aid for the siblings before the government announcement today.         
	The doctors have told the parents, Razia and Samsuddin, that their progeria-struck kids had no chance of living longer. Samsuddin, a poor man, works as a guard in Calcutta while his wife is a manual labourer at her native place.        
	The brothers look old now with the disease catching up on them. Their sisters Guria, Rehana and Rubina  all suffering from the same disease died at 24, 17 and 13 years of age, respectively.        
	Experts have estimated that there are only 48 progeric patients across the world. Samsuddins is, probably, the only known family in India afflicted with this syndrome. The disease occurs in one per eight million live births. Those born with progeria live only about 13 to early 20s. Ageing manifests very fast among the patients afflicted with progeria, according to experts.        
	Eqramul and Ali have also expressed their wish to meet Big B and Abhishek who have played the roles of son and father, respectively, in Paa, released on December 4.

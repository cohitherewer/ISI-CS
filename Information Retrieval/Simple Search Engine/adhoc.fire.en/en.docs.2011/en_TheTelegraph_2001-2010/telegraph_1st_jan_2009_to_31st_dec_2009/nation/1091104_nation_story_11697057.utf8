The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | DNA disclosure and relief for Tiwari 
                                                                                    Wednesday , November 4 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            DNA disclosure and relief for Tiwari 
  - Citing delay, HC dismisses paternity suit against governor; test says parent not biological dad         RASHEED KIDWAI                          Tiwari                                        
	Nov. 3: Delhi High Court today dismissed a paternity suit against N.D. Tiwari by Rohit Shekhar, the 30-year-old grandson of a former Union minister, who claimed the veteran Congress leader and current Andhra Pradesh governor was his biological father.        
	The verdict of the single-judge bench came two days after a private laboratory in New Delhi concluded that Rohits father, Bimal Prasad Sharma, was not his biological parent.        
	Sharma and Rohit had voluntarily given their DNA samples to Truth Lab in New Delhis Bikaji Cama Place for familial and personal purpose.        
	However, before the report could be submitted to the high court, Justice S.N. Dhingra observed that Rohits suit was not maintainable on grounds of limitation, which refers to delay in filing a case.        
	In his petition, Rohit, a lawyer, had claimed he was born out of an intimate relationship between his mother Ujjwala Sharma and Tiwari. He had not sought any financial benefits.        
	At the last hearing on October 13, Tiwaris lawyers had argued that Rohit should have filed the suit within three years of turning 18, instead of in 2008. They cited Article 137 of the Limitation Act, 1963.        
	Tiwaris counsel Rajiv Nayyar contended that Rohits plea was barred under time limitation and was therefore not maintainable.        
	At his Defence Colony residence in New Delhi, Rohit said he was stunned by the court order.        
	The verdict is yet to sink in. I will move the division bench and the superior court, he said.        
	B.P. Sharma and Ujjwala, who legally separated in 2006, declined comment. Tiwari, a four-time chief minister, could not be reached for comment as he is out of the country.        
	The octogenarian Congress leader, while acknowledging his association with Ujjwala, had denied he was Rohits father and refused to undergo a DNA test, citing a court order.        
	Tiwari had described Rohits mother as an unchaste woman and remarked that he had been her paramour even during the subsistence of her marriage.        
	Ujjwala had, however, insisted that Rohit was Tiwaris son and gave a written statement to the court alleging Tiwari had drawn her into the extra-marital relationship.        
	Believing the repeated requests and being convinced of the love and affection shown by Tiwari, hailing from a respectable and prestigious family, I submitted to emotional pressure and that culminated in the birth of Rohit Shekhar, she had said.        
	Ujjwalas father Sher Singh was a Congress leader who was minister of state for defence in Indira Gandhis government.        
	Tiwari was Indian Youth Congress president when he came in touch with Sher Singh in 1967. The following year, Ujjwala was appointed joint secretary in the womens wing of the Youth Congress, then headed by Nandini Sathpathy.        
	Away from the legal battle, B.P. Sharmas willingness to undergo a DNA test is being seen as a trend-setter.        
	Psychiatrist Ruma Bhattacharya said Sharmas decision to prove the illegitimacy of his son reflected a new penchant for transparency creeping into society.        
	Without going into the legal aspects of the case, she said: It is a new trend in society where there is no social shame involved. So far the presumption was that a child born to a married woman is the legitimate child of the husband.         
	Bhattacharya, however, was sceptical about the use of DNA testing in private family matters.        
	Maybe in Rohits case he was aware of everything and volunteered, she said.        
	But public acknowledgement of illegitimacy can be traumatic and may lead to depression or suicidal tendencies.

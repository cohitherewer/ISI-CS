The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | In crisis, discount schemes for home buyers 
                                                                                                               In crisis, discount schemes for home buyers 
  - City developers offer to pay part of interest on building loans to revive demand          SAMBIT SAHA                                    
	Calcutta, March 14: Some city developers are offering to pay a part of the interest on buyers home loans to revive demand, hit by the economic slowdown.        
	Four leading developers have unveiled subvention schemes under which they pay their customers pre-equated monthly instalments (pre-EMIs) to banks or housing finance companies for an agreed period.        
	The pre-EMI represents only the interest on the loan taken. Unlike the EMI, which the buyer starts paying later, it does not include any component of the principal.        
	In two housing projects, the developers  Eden City and Ruchi Group  are offering to pay the pre-EMI from the time the buyer books the flat till he takes possession. With the average period for this being about 30 months, the scheme in effect offers the buyer a 10-12 per cent discount on the flats price.        
	A third project  Calcutta Riverside, an upcoming township at Batanagar  is offering to pay the pre-EMI for a fixed 12 months, the discount working out to 3 to 5 per cent.         
	Keppel Land, a Singapore developer, too has announced a one-year pre-EMI offer in addition to its older incentive scheme for buyers: free travel and lodging during a three night-four day trip to Singapore for two.        
	Several more developers are expected to come out with their own subvention packages. Developers in western and northern India have been offering such incentives but this is a first in Calcutta.        
	The sales slump in the city shows in Calcutta Municipal Corporation statistics: it sanctioned 941 buildings in October-December 2007 but only 225 in the same period last year.        
	We are trying to create a buzz around the (subvention) scheme in the hope of reviving the market, Indrajit De, managing director of Eden City, said.        
	Eden is offering its subvention scheme for 200 flats in its upcoming project at Maheshtala, after sales fell to a fourth of the early 2008 figure. The Ruchi Group is making the offer on its new project, Active Acres, off EM Bypass.        
	Its a limited-period offer. There are 450 units on offer now, but not all of them will get this scheme. We have to see how the market responds, a Ruchi official said.        
	Ambuja Realty, owned by Harshvardhan Neotia, is planning a subvention scheme for its Uphaar project on EM Bypass, where 150-odd flats will be on offer. We are yet to decide the tenure, an official said.        
	Subvention schemes are a better instrument to prop up demand than reducing the price, which only increases buyers expectation for more rate cuts, resulting in fewer sales, said Abhijit Das, city head of the property consultancy, Jones Lang LaSalle Meghraj.        
	An HDFC official said the schemes made equal sense for the developers, buyers and housing finance companies.        
	While the builder sells fast, the buyer too gains, whether he is an investor who would later sell the flat or house, or an end-user who will live there.        
	For the end-user, the scheme amounts to a straight discount. It will be of most benefit to those who now live in rented houses and find it tough to pay their monthly rent and pre-EMI simultaneously, the HDFC official said.        
	Under a subvention scheme, an investor pays only 15-20 per cent of the property value when he books it. He then pays nothing till possession, waiting for a rise in prices to sell it. Without the scheme, he may be paying 10-12 per cent more to hold the flat.        
	Finance companies stand to gain because higher sales means more demand for home loans. Just to be safe, they plan to take the total pre-EMI from the developer at one go.        
	Pradeep Sureka, president of builders body Credai (Bengal), said the real estate market was keenly watching the development. If they (developers offering the schemes) prove successful, others will surely follow, he said.        
	The HDFC official, however, said housing finance companies would only work with top-notch developers. Dont expect the neighbourhood builder to offer such schemes.

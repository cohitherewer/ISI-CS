	New Delhi, March 4: The Centre is doing everything possible to stall the auction in New York tomorrow of Mahatma Gandhis pocket watch and glasses, but the private collector who owns them has demanded that the government do something good for the Indian people if it wants the items.        
	James Otis, a documentary maker based in California, has said he would be willing to gift Gandhis belongings to India if the government agrees to spend 5 per cent of the GDP on the poor.        
	I will ask the Indian government if they would do a great gesture to the poorest of India, like those that weve all seen in Slumdog Millionaire, Otis said.        
	The glasses and the pocket watch, which Gandhi had gifted his grandniece Abha, are to be auctioned along with his leather sandals, plate and bowl by Antiquorum Auctioneers in New York. The estimated price of the collection is $20,000 to $30,000.        
	Whatever is required to bring back those items will be done, tourism and culture minister Ambika Soni said, adding that the foreign ministry would approach the US state department.        
	Junior foreign minister Anand Sharma echoed her: We have asked our embassy in Washington and Consulate General of India in New York to do everything that is required through the bidding process or otherwise to acquire the Father of the Nations personal assets for the country.        
	Till the auction was announced, no one knew where these assets were.         
	Yesterday, Delhi High Court stayed the auction. The Indian consulate in New York has been told to argue that ownership of these items is in dispute and that the high court has given an injunction to stop the sale.         
	But it is doubtful whether the high court order can stop the auction, a culture ministry official said.         
	Justice Anil Kumar passed the interim order on a plea by the Ahmedabad-based Navjivan Trust, the sole repository of all intellectual property of Mahatma Gandhi under his will.        
	In passing the order, the court went by a precedent set by Madras High Court in 1996 when it stayed the auction of Gandhis manuscript. The London-based Phillips Sons and Neale stopped the auction after they were served a legal notice by the Indian High Commission stating that the manuscript was stolen property and that its ownership vested with the trust founded by the Mahatma in 1929. The Indian government had simultaneously filed a case in London to stop the auction. A legal settlement was reached and the manuscript given back to India.         
	Additional solicitor general Mohan Parasaran said these articles could not be sold as they belonged to India and had been illegally taken away from this country. Under private international law, the issue of jurisdiction does not come in the way of the order, Parasaran said.         
	But senior counsel Joseph Vellapally wondered how Delhi High Court could have passed such a restraining order against a US-based auction house. What happens if the auction house ignores the order?         
	The ministry official said that if the government failed to stop the auction, we will have to think about the prospects of taking part in the auction.         
	Governments usually dont participate in such auctions. Besides, the price would be too steep.        
	Not too steep for rich Indians though. Indian American hotelier Sant Singh Chatwal said he, with some friends, would bid for the items and was ready to pay up to a quarter of a million dollars. If they did manage to buy Gandhis belongings, they would send them back to India, Chatwal said.

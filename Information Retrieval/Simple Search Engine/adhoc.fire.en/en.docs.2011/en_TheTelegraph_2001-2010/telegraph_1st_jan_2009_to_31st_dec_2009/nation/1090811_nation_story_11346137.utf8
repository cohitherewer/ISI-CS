The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Four-leg route to grassroots
                                                                                                               Four-leg route to grassroots
          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                              
	Aug. 10: She has addressed rallies. She has stopped her convoys on rural highways to speak to a couple of villagers among lined-up hundreds.        
	Now Sonia Gandhi seems to be turning to a centuries-old institution of grassroots democracy for closer, interactive sessions with her constituents in Rae Bareli.        
	She arrived at Lucknow at 9am today and drove 40km to Beriaya Ka Tola village, where she sat down on a charpoy under a makeshift shamiana. Some 300 people  men and women, upper castes and Dalits  sat in a circle around her in an open field.        
	This was the Congress presidents first ever chaupal  a small village meeting where people discuss problems and solutions, and where everybody has the same freedom to speak, irrespective of caste, religion or gender.        
	A farmer, Ramesh Soni, stood up. My paddy fields are not receiving irrigation water. This is a season of drought, what will I do? he asked.        
	Sonia asked the village head to solve the problem. A local irrigation officer said a narrow drain would be dug to link Sonis fields with the key irrigation canal.        
	Sonia held two more chaupals and, in the next two days of her August 10-12 trip to Rae Bareli, will hold at least six more, party leaders said.        
	She is showing a lot of interest in reviving the tradition of chaupals, said party spokesperson Akhilesh Pratap Singh. Unlike the khap (caste) panchayats further northwest  in the news for ordering murders, divorces and social boycotts  these are forums for free discussion, not kangaroo courts where elders and village heads pass diktats. Sonias son Rahul has been holding chaupals  once a hallmark of Mahatma Gandhis politics  for the past couple of years.        
	Sonias Beriaya Ka Tola chaupal lasted over half an hour. The next two  at Sudakan in Bachrawa and another village near Jais  were a little shorter and the crowds were smaller at 150-200.        
	At these two places, she sat under banyan trees, the traditional site of chaupals. However, the villagers sat across a barrier 10-15m away, and between them and Sonia stood her security personnel.

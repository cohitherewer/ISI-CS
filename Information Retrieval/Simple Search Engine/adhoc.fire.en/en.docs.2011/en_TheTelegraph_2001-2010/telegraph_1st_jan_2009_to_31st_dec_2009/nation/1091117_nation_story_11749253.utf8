          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 16: The Catholic Church, worried at the evil influence of television on people, has issued a circular warning against the dangers of watching sex and violence in the drawing room, especially for the youth.         
	In Kerala, which has the largest number of Catholics in the country, the circular was issued yesterday. It was titled Family and Media.         
	The family commission of the Catholic Bishops Council will issue the circular in parishes across the country by the end of the year.         
	The Kerala circular said television channels resorted to sex and violence to attract viewers. It pointed to the serious danger of television controlling a familys daily schedule, including prayer time.         
	People should control the media, but what is happening is the reverse, the circular said, adding that the media was controlling people with programmes of inferior quality.         
	It expressed dismay that sex and violence dominated primetime on all channels. Society will experience far-reaching consequences as people become addicted to these programmes that convey nothing, the circular warned.

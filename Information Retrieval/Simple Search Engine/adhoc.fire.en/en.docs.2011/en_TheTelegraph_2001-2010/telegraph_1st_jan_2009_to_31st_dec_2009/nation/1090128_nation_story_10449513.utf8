The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Govt tweak in Mulayam case
                                                                                                               Govt tweak in Mulayam case
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 27: The Centre and the CBI appear to have opted for a course correction in the Mulayam Singh Yadav disproportionate assets case in the Supreme Court.        
	The Centre brought in solicitor-general G.E. Vahanvati to represent it and the CBI replaced its counsel Gopal Subramanian with Mohan Parasaran.        
	The moves came days after the top court sharply criticised the CBI for its flip-flop in the case. The agency had first said it would submit its report to the court and then opted for the government.        
	Vahanvati, who had earlier suggested the case against Mulayam be closed, today told the court his earlier opinion was not relevant to his appearance in the case. I had given an opinion in November. It is not relevant.        
	But the court said the final decision would be taken only after a detailed hearing that was fixed for February 10 on the CBIs request.        
	On January 6, the court had criticised the CBI for failing to decide who it wanted to submit its report to. The CBI had initially said it was an independent agency and would place its report before the court but changed its mind after Vahanvatis suggestion.        
	The turnaround came months after the Samajwadi Party voted for the UPA in the July trust vote, stoking speculation that political considerations were at play.        
	You had earlier said you are an independent body you are not bound to submit reports to any government what has happened since then? the court had asked.        
	CBI counsel Subramanian had then justified the change saying the agency had received inputs from affected individuals (Mulayam and his relatives). But the court had warned: We dont want the CBI to become an instrument of the central government.        
	When the court reconvened today, the CBI changed its counsel, partly because of the courts displeasure.        
	Isnt Mr Subramanian appearing? the bench wondered as Parasaran sought time to look into the case details. The court granted him time, but said it would not allow the hearing to be stalled for too long.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mulayam amp; Kalyan in huddle
                                                                                                               Mulayam amp; Kalyan in huddle
                              Mulayam, Kalyan                            
	New Delhi, Jan. 18 (PTI): BJP leader Kalyan Singh today met Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav amid speculation that he might switch sides ahead of the general election.         
	Kalyan, the BJPs Mandal-Mandir face and a party vice-president, held talks with Mulayam at an undisclosed location in east Delhi for more than an hour this afternoon, a Samajwadi source said. Party general secretary Amar Singh was also present.        
	Kalyan has been openly criticising the BJPs policies and had spoken out in favour of former Vice-President Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, who caused a furore in the BJP when he said he would contest the general election.        
	Sources in the BJP said the fear of possible disciplinary action might have prompted Kalyan to go and meet Mulayam.         
	His anti-party stand and open criticism for the last six months is reason enough for action against him, a BJP leader said.         
	Kalyan is the BJPs candidate from Etah for the general election.

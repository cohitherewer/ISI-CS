	Patna, Feb. 2: Suspected Maoists blew up a portion of a bridge over a canal near Berhni village in south Bihars Aurangabad district today.        
	The rebels used dynamite to blast the bridge on Deo-Balugani road, apparently to obstruct the movement of police vehicles and patrolling by paramilitary forces, superintendent of police Ganesh Kumar said.        
	The Maoists have been successful in their mission, as only small vehicles like motorcycles or scooters can negotiate through the broken bridge but no big vehicle can pass it. Kumar suspected involvement of Maoists in the act though no rebel outfit has so far claimed responsibility.        
	The security forces armoured vehicles and patrol jeeps had been using the bridge to consistently raid Maoist strongholds of Baluganj and Ketaki in the district, 220km from here.

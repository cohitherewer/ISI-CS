The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Price protest in House
                                                                                                               Price protest in House
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Orissa Assembly                                  
	Bhubaneswar, July 16: Both Opposition and ruling party legislators today voiced their concern over the spiralling price rise of essential commodities in the Assembly.         
	While Opposition members lambasted the Naveen Patnaik government for its failure in containing the price rise ruling party members blamed the UPA government at the Centre for what they labelled as a national phenomenon.         
	Moving an adjournment motion, Opposition chief whip Prasad Harichandan said Naveen had taken political mileage for launching Rs 2 per kg rice scheme for the poor. Can the poor afford to buy lentil at Rs 80 per kg, edible oil for Rs 60 to Rs 100 per litre and vegetables priced between Rs 40 to 80 per kg, he asked.        
	Describing the price situation as alarming, the Opposition alleged that the poor and the lower middle-class were being hard hit. They warned that the situation would worsen if a flood struck.         
	The chief minister has done nothing to resolve the crisis except write letters to the Prime Minister and pass the buck to the Centre, alleged S.S. Saluja of the Congress.         
	The Opposition alleged that traders were not complying to the decisions taken at a meeting chaired by chief minister on July 13. This exposes an unholy nexus between the government and unscrupulous traders, said an Opposition member.         
	Independent member Pratap Chandra Sarangi said the rise happened because the government, ruling for nine years, failed to make the state self-reliant in production of foodgrain, pulse, vegetable, fish and poultry.

          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                              
	Ranchi, Dec. 27: Shibu Soren will be sworn in as Jharkhand chief minister on December 30, probably with All Jharkhand Students Union president Sudesh Mahto as his deputy.        
	The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha chief, accompanied by son Hemant, today went to the Raj Bhavan where governor K. Sankaranarayanan accepted his claim to form the government.        
	Soren had staked his claim yesterday, handing the governor a list of 42 MLAs  a majority in the House of 81  which included lawmakers from his party, the BJP and Ajsu and an Independent. The Janata Dal (United), which has two MLAs, later offered him support. No other party or front has so far staked claim to form a government. The Election Commission has already notified constitution of the Vidhan Sabha, a Raj Bhavan spokesman said.        
	The chief minister is likely to be sworn in with 11 other cabinet ministers  three each from the JMM and Ajsu, four from the BJP and one from the JD(U). Sources said the JMM front runners for ministry berths are Hemlal Murmu, Teklal Mahto and Haji Hussain Ansari.        
	Ajsu chief Sudesh Mahto is likely to be deputy chief minister and may get the home portfolio along with several other important departments. Ajsu MLAs Chandra Prakash Choudhary and Kamal Kishore Bhagat are likely to be sworn in too.        
	The likely ministerial candidates from the BJP are Raghubar Das, Neelkanth Singh Munda, Arun Mandal and Baijnath Ram.        
	The Speakers chair too will probably go to the BJP, with senior leader C.P. Singh a strong contender. Yesterday, Singhs supporters had allegedly vandalised the BJP office, demanding he be made a minister and Das the Speaker.        
	Sudha Choudhary of the JD(U) is likely to be the lone female minister in Sorens cabinet. The first-time MLA defeated veteran Radha Krishna Kishore in the Assembly polls.        
	There may be a few minor changes to the projected names, but the power-sharing formula is almost final, said a senior BJP leader who had played a key role in striking pacts with the JMM and other allies.        
	In the evening, state Congress president Pradeep Kumar Balmuchu met senior party colleagues to analyse the poll results and discuss plans. The Congress legislature party meeting will be held on December 30, where our partys new leader in the House will be elected, Balmuchu said.

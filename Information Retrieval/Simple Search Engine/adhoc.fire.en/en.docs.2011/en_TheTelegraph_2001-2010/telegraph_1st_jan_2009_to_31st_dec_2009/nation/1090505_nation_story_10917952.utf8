The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rajnath angles for national stamp
                                                                                                               Rajnath angles for national stamp
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN IN GHAZIABAD                          Rajnath: Larger role                                  
	Out of Ghaziabads 18 lakh voters, only about 60,000 are Thakurs  the caste Rajnath Singh belongs to.        
	Muslims number 3.45 lakhs, Dalits 3.15 lakhs and Brahmins 2.8 lakhs.        
	Yet the BJP president chose this constituency, allegedly against his partys wishes, to fight the election  in the hope it would stamp him as national leader on a par with L.K. Advani or even Narendra Modi.        
	His role models  Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi who do not need to worry about caste equations in Rae Bareli and Amethi. The name Gandhi and the network of patronage they have built in these constituencies see them through.        
	Rajnath believes he has acquired a larger-than-Uttar Pradesh image over the past three years and this will help him override the caste factor so important in elections.        
	Caste was not on Rajnathjis mind. He chose Ghaziabad because it has very few Thakurs. He wanted to prove the point that in Uttar Pradesh, elections are also about factors other than caste, said Ashok Jahanvi, an RSS worker, who kept vigil in the BJP office on Ambedkar Road with a colleague.        
	Charts crowd the office walls with ward-wise break-ups of the population on various parameters, not caste though.         
	The caste break-up in Ghaziabad would be just right for Mayavati, who came to power in Uttar Pradesh riding Dalit and Brahmin support in 2007.        
	But barring her dedicated voters, nobodys taking BSP candidate Amarpal Sharma seriously. A sanitary fittings vendor and a social worker, he contested the 2007 Assembly polls as an Independent and got nearly 50,000 votes. Thought to be apolitical and not ambitious, he fits Mayavatis candidate profile perfectly.        
	Incumbent MP Surendra Goel of the Congress is dismissed by local lawyer and BJP votary Mukesh Tyagi as the bandar (monkey) of Ram Leela  he used to play Hanuman.         
	But Goel, who won corporation and Assembly polls before becoming an MP, has the grit that comes from going through the grind and, as a bonus, the Samajwadi Partys support. Besides Amethi and Rae Bareli, Ghaziabad is the only seat where the Samajwadis have not fielded a candidate.         
	Rajnath had announced his candidature with aplomb and said that barring one public meeting that he would address, the party would take care of everything.        
	With a day left before campaigning closes on Tuesday, caste has become a factor for Rajnath.         
	Thakur Sunil Singh, the state secretary of BJP ally Rashtriya Lok Dal, said he was being summoned daily from his base in Bulandshahr, about 70km away, to woo the 60,000 Jat voters.         
	K.C. Tyagi, a former Ghaziabad MP and veteran leader of the Janata Dal (United), another BJP ally, has been asked to stay put to consolidate the Tyagi votes.        
	The BJP chief is not leaving the campaigning to the party, but is banking also on the parivar  his wife, sons and daughter are all camping in the city.         
	Loyalists of the former BJP MP Ramesh Chand Tomar, who won the seat four times and joined the Congress on being denied a ticket this time, crow that the Ghaziabad party apparatus was not really with Rajnath.         
	In our heart of hearts, we dont want another dynasty to be created here. Today if Rajnath wins this seat, tomorrow his son will lay claim to it and the day after, it will be a grandson, a local worker said.        
	But if there is one thing going for the BJP chief, it is his national stature.         
	Subhash Chandra Sharma, a lawyer, said: Whether in the Opposition or in government, Rajnath will do better than the present Congress MP. I switched to the Lok Sabha TV channel once to watch question hour. Goel raised a question and argued effectively for the metro link to Ghaziabad. But the urban development minister dismissed his question out of hand. He wouldnt have done it had Rajnath asked.        
	But Vibhakar, a writer, recalled that Ghaziabads lone experience with an outsider was not memorable. Congressman K.N. Singh, who belonged to Sultanpur, once won from here and became minister. Let alone work, he didnt show his face once, he said.        
	Goel is available 24x7 to share our sorrows and partake of our joys, Shamshad Ali, a lawyer, puts it.        
	But at the end of the day, even BSP and Congress sympathisers concede that eventually and somehow Rajnath would make it.        
	 Ghaziabad votes on May 7

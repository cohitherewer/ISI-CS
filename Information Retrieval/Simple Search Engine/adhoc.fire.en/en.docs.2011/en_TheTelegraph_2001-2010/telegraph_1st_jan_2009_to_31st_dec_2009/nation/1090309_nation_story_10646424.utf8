          RASHEED KIDWAI AND NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                    
	New Delhi, March 8: The Samajwadi Party today played a blow-hot-blow-cold game with the Congress, first appearing to take a killer hard-line on an alliance and then softening its stance twice in succession.        
	In the end, indications from the Samajwadi camp were that the party  which had till now insisted that 17 seats were the absolute maximum the Congress could expect  might be willing to give it three or four more.        
	In the days first salvo, however, Mulayam Singh Yadav had cut that figure to just six amid fears that it might be all over for the proposed alliance.        
	The Samajwadi chief announced candidates for 74 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh, saying the Congress could have the remaining six. He made one small concession: We may fight separately but there is no bitterness.        
	Hours later, Mulayam said he was open to a post-poll alliance with the Congress and stressed that he did not want the two parties relations to sour.        
	Late in the evening, party general secretary Amar Singh said even a pre-poll alliance was still possible if the Congress scaled down its demand from 24 seats.        
	Samajwadi sources suggested there could be a last-minute understanding on 20-21 seats. The Congress had unilaterally announced 24 candidates a few days ago, prompting the Samajwadis to ask it to prune the list to 17 names.        
	Todays developments have raised Congress hopes that negotiations are still possible. The partys poll managers for Uttar Pradesh said they hoped that in the next two days, top leaders such as Sonia Gandhi and Mulayam  or their sons Rahul and Akhilesh  might step in and break the stalemate.        
	So far, the Congresss official stand has been that there is no question of going back on its demand for 24 seats.        
	Over the past two days, the Samajwadis had dropped enough hints that they might rethink their list (before today) of 65 declared candidates if the Congress cut back its demand.        
	Todays move, Samajwadi sources said, came after an assessment that some Congress leaders had begun to view the Samajwadis sense of accommodation as a weakness. Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh has constantly been telling the Samajwadis that in case they didnt relent, his party was prepared to go it alone and field candidates from all the states constituencies.        
	Mulayams announcement of nine more candidates today was just an effort to put more pressure on the Congress, the sources said. Hence his effort to leave the door ajar with the comment about there being no bitterness.        
	Analysts said that one other reason for the tactic an initial hard line followed by climbdowns  was that the Samajwadis wanted to appear as the one side making all the concessions. They apparently hope this would put them in a better position to bargain hard when the crucial post-poll negotiations start.        
	Even today, the Samajwadi did not field candidates from Rae Bareli and Amethi, the seats of Sonia and Rahul, or the constituencies of Union ministers Jitin Prasada (Dhaurahra) and Sriprakash Jaiswal (Kanpur). The two other seats left vacant are Ghaziabad  from where BJP chief Rajnath Singh is contesting  and Mathura.        
	Privately, senior leaders of both parties concede an alliance is their only chance of containing the Bahujan Samaj Party. Mayavati now has 18 MPs, and many Congress and Samajwadi leaders believe that she will be the biggest winner in a four-corner contest (the BJP being the fourth player).        
	The All India Congress Committees central election panel will take the final call on the alliance on March 10.        
	In the 2004 general election, the Congress had won nine seats and put up a credible fight in another half-a-dozen seats.

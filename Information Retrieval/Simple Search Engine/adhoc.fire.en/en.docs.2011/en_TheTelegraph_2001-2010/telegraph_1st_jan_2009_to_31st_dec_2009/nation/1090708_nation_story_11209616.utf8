The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Resort threat to Jarawas
                                                                                                               Resort threat to Jarawas
          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                              
	July 7: A court clearance for a luxury resort to be built near the Jarawa tribals protected habitat on South Andaman island has sparked concern among government officials and activists in India and abroad.        
	The sight of Jarawa boys standing on the road with palms stretched out would break my heart, an activist in the Andamans said. But an average tourist would try to lure them by offering food and drink, make them an object of pleasure.        
	The Andamans administration had obtained a stay on the construction of the resort  a chain of luxury tents  by the Chennai-based Barefoot Resort. The company, which apparently hosted Oscar-winning Hollywood actress Kate Winslet at another of its resorts in the Andamans, is believed to be eyeing mainly foreign and celebrity guests.        
	On July 2, however, Calcutta High Courts circuit bench in Port Blair ruled in favour of Barefoot. The administration plans to approach the Supreme Court, sources said.        
	Some 300-odd extinction-threatened Jarawas, believed to be descendants of the early humans who moved out of Africa thousands of years ago, fend for themselves in the forests of South and Middle Andaman. Those on South Andaman live within a 700sqkm reserve created for their protection, hunting pigs, lizard monitors and fish with their spears and collecting berries, honey and fruits.        
	The project is threatening the survival of the Jarawas, the London-based Survival International has warned.        
	Its director Stephen Corie said the proposed resort, off Collinpur beach, was barely 500 metres from the Jarawa reserve. Barefoot managing director Samit Sawhny, however, claimed the site was 3.2km from the reserve.        
	We dont propose to sell the Jarawa to promote tourism; (our intention is) surely not to evoke voyeuristic pleasure among the tourists, Sawhney said.        
	Till 1998, the Jarawas avoided any direct contact with the outside world. Since then they have been venturing out, and can easily walk up to the resort, if it comes up, within half an hour.        
	The Jarawas visit Collinpur regularly and interact with villagers and also come to the beach. They could be easily induced to visit more frequently through small allurements, an anthropologist said.        
	Barefoot had bought the plot from Bangladeshi settlers and begun construction when the administration moved court and, after losing in the lower courts, appealed in the high court.        
	The government argued the resort encroaches on the 5km-long buffer zone where no trade and tourism activities are allowed. But Barefoots lawyer Anjali Nag claimed the so-called buffer zone was a ploy to selectively block certain companies entry into the Andamans.        
	Now it may not take long for others to set up resorts nearby, rued S.K. Narayan, a tribal activist in Port Blair.

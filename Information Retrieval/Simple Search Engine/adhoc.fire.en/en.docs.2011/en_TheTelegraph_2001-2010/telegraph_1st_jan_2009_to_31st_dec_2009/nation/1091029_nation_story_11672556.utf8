          G.C. SHEKHAR                              
	Chennai, Oct. 28: If you love eating chicken, scrap Kerala from your travel menu.        
	A tax-evasion scam involving chicken suppliers in Tamil Nadu has led to a scarcity of the poultry bird in Kerala and a glut in Tamil Nadu, which accounts for 60 per cent of its neighbours chicken supply every day.        
	After the scam amounting to Rs 13 crore was detected two weeks ago, Kerala had restricted the import of live chicken from Tamil Nadu in the Palladam-Pongalur-Udumelpet belt.        
	The move has stopped the transport of one lakh live chicken every day from Tamil Nadus poultry farms and led to a sharp rise in chicken prices in Kerala.        
	Live chicken in the state now costs Rs 75 a kilo, an increase of Rs 15. On the other hand, the glut in Tamil Nadu has forced chicken farmers to sell for as low as Rs 35 a kilo against the Rs 45 a kilo they used to charge.        
	We are losing up to Rs 20 a kilo for every chicken as the unjust ban by Kerala is hurting our livelihood, said K. Kannan, secretary of the Broiler Co-ordination Committee at Palladam.        
	Sources said the large-scale duty evasion with connivance of Kerala officials at check posts had started after Kerala imposed an entry tax of 12.5 per cent on every kilogram of chicken that enters the state.         
	The Kerala government then came up with a new condition from August 1  the tax should be paid only as demand drafts. But Kerala officials later found out that most of the demand drafts suppliers from Tamil Nadu furnished at check posts were fake and bounced when presented to banks.        
	They had made alterations to cheques to resemble pay orders which resulted in a loss of Rs 13 crore, Kerala finance minister Thomas Issac said, blaming a group of unscrupulous suppliers in Tamil Nadu for the current situation.        
	Issac said corrupt traders had been blacklisted but a new set of suppliers  mostly smaller ones  were being registered and chicken was being sourced from them.        
	True, chicken prices might have shot up now, but it is a temporary phenomenon as we plan to deregulate the import soon, he said.

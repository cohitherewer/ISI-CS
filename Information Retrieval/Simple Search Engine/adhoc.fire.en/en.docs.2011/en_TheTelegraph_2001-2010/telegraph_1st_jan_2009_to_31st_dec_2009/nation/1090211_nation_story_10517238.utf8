                                                                                                               Knowledge council in line of fire
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 10: Several members of the countrys top advisory body on education today criticised the National Knowledge Commission and asked the government to reject its recommendations.         
	The criticism came at the first meeting of the reconstituted Central Advisory Board of Education chaired by human resource development minister Arjun Singh.         
	The boards remarks, prominently mentioned in a press note released by the HRD ministry late this evening, strengthens sections of the government keen to see the end of the commission headed by technocrat Sam Pitroda.         
	The panel was set up by the Prime Minister in 2005 to prepare a blueprint for Indias transformation into a knowledge society  a key vision of Manmohan Singh.         
	But the commission has since had several clashes with the HRD ministry centred on the panels complaint that the ministry is strangling the autonomy of higher education institutions in India. Its term  already extended by six months  ends on April 2.         
	Board member Zoya Hasan, also a member of the National Commission for Minorities and teacher at the Jawaharlal Nehru University, criticised the panels recommendations for promoting expansion without accountability.         
	The NKC wants India to expand its higher education like never before but at the same time wants deregulation when higher education in our country is already under-regulated. The government, with all its failings, is accountable, she said.         
	Autonomy and regulation are not contradictory, Hasan added.         
	Another member, K.K. Aboobacker, the president of the Muslim Educational Society, alleged that the commission had ignored the needs of minorities in its recommendations.         
	At least two state education ministers belonging to the Congress also criticised certain aspects of its recommendations. They applauded Arjuns efforts in implementing OBC reservations despite the panels opposition to quotas in higher education.

	Watch it, minister      
	Bhopal: Elections are more than a month away, but Madhya Pradesh minister Gaurishankar Bisen is already neck deep in battle  to save his chair after the Election Commission directed police to register a case of bribery and inducement against him.    
	Bisen, who had been raring to take on Union commerce minister Kamal Nath from Chhindwara, was caught on camera on Friday distributing wristwatches to local journalists at a hotel in Seoni district.    
	State election commissioner J.S. Mathur said the Holi gift was clearly a violation of the model code of conduct. An FIR has been registered against the minister under Section 171B and 171E of the Indian Penal Code for inducement and bribery with Seoni police.    
	Bisen, known for his impeccable dress sense and a wardrobe of business suits, safaris and bandgallas, denies distributing the watches. He says the small boxes that resembled wristwatch boxes contained gulal for celebrating Holi.    
	Television footage, however, showed Bisen handing gift boxes that contained wristwatches.     
	Before the alleged violation, Bisen, along with state commerce minister Kailash Vijayvargiya, had been asking for a ticket against Kamal Nath from Chhindwara.    
	Bisen believes he is a better man to challenge Kamal Nath than Vijayvargiya, considered the No. 2 in the Shivraj cabinet, as his home district Balaghat adjoins Chhindwara. He represented the Balaghat Lok Sabha seat twice and, in 2008, successfully contested the Assembly polls to become a minister.    
	Nath has a formidable record in Chhindwara. Since 1980, he has lost only once in a by-election in 1997.    
	The BJP is yet to find a suitable candidate for Chhindwara, though the name of actress Smriti Irani has been doing the rounds.    
	LKA battle     
	Ahmedabad: The Gujarat Congress has recommended the names of two leaders to take on L.K. Advani in Gandhinagar.    
	Suresh Patel, a two-time MLA from Kalol, and C.J. Chavda, a former Gandhinagar MLA and trusted lieutenant of Union minister Shankersinh Vaghela, are the front-runners, party sources said.    
	We have strongly recommended either Chavda or Patel for the Gandhinagar Lok Sabha seat, Congress spokesperson Arjun Modhvadia said.

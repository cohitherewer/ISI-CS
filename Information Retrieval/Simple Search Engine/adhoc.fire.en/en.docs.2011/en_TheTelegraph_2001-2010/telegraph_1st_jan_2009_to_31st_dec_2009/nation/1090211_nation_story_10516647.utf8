The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | D-gun out for Kasab
                                                                                                               D-gun out for Kasab
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 10: The D-company has cast its shadow on Ajmal Kasab.         
	An intelligence input from the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) says that Chhota Shakeel has been contracted by Pakistans Inter-services Intelligence (ISI) to eliminate Kasab, the lone terrorist captured during the Mumbai attacks.         
	Shakeel, like his mentor Dawood Ibrahim, is believed to be hiding in Pakistan under protection of the ISI.        
	Sources in the Mumbai police crime branch have confirmed that RAW, Indias external intelligence agency, intercepted an Internet telephonic conversation between Pakistani handlers and their point men to bump off Kasab. Shakeel, according to the conversation, has already assigned 15 sharp-shooters to do the job.         
	The call, emerging from Bhuj in Gujarat, was made on January 29. Intelligence officials and Gujarat police are trying to trace the Internet Protocol (IP) address to track down those behind it.        
	The transcript as available with us says that the ISI has been in touch with Chhota Shakeel to carry out the act, said a top Mumbai police source.         
	Kasab, who is in police custody at an undisclosed location with multiple layers of security, is Indias best bet in unmasking the terror masterminds, who, New Delhi believes, are operating within Pakistan with the blessings of some official agencies.         
	He is a fringe radical and has always been the point man between the ISI and the D-company. He has been asked to prepare the blueprint of the attack on Kasab, said the police official.        
	The plan, according the transcript, is to kill Kasab when he is shifted to Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai, where many arrested D-company gangsters are lodged.

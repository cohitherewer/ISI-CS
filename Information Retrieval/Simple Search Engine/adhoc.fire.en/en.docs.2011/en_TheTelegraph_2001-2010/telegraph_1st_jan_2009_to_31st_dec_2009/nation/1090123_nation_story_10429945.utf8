The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Siege on killer jawans mind
                                                                                                               Siege on killer jawans mind
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Jan. 22: Assam Rifles investigators today admitted that the siege of Siroy could have played on the mind of the Naga jawan who gunned down six of his colleagues and fled with his AK-47 rifle in Manipurs Ukhrul district.         
	The biggest manhunt in Manipurs history is now on for Rifleman Sheneyi Medio.         
	A spokesperson for the paramilitary force today said a court of inquiry had been ordered into the killings. But a senior officer said: The jawan had spoken out against the siege to some of his colleagues in the past couple of days. It may not be the only reason for the crime but it could be one of them.        
	Awang Kasom, the checkpost where the seven jawans were positioned, is barely 10km from Siroy where Assam Rifles troops have surrounded a makeshift camp of the NSCN (Isak-Muivah) since Sunday.         
	The troops destroyed two bunkers of the outfit this week.         
	On Tuesday, a deputy inspector-general asked NSCN (I-M) to wind up its so-called designated camp in Ukhrul district, home of its general secretary Thuingaleng Muivah. When the outfit refused, troops surrounded it to cut off food supplies and evict the rebels.        
	According to the ceasefire agreement between the Naga militants and the government, designated camps are provided to the rebels only in Nagaland.         
	The Assam Rifles spokesperson clarified that Medio took away only his AK rifle. Police had said last night he took all seven weapons.

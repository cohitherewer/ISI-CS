The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PC in America for Pak trial
                                                                                                               PC in America for Pak trial

	Washington, Sep. 8: With Islamabad clearly dragging its feet on the investigation and prosecution of accomplices in the terror attack on Mumbai last year, a trial of Pakistan will, instead, be figuratively held in absentia in Washington this week.         
	Union home minister P. Chidambaram today began his four-day US visit, hoping to rely less on dossiers and tapes as evidence against Pakistan. Instead, he will be arguing as a trained lawyer that the prosecution of terrorists across the border is a farce and that leads given by India to ensure justice in the Mumbai attack are not being followed up in Islamabad.        
	While Chidambaram hopes to put Pakistan in the dock, his arguments will be tailored to the realisation that the bulk of the American establishment wants to retain Islamabad as the centre-piece of its actions in Afghanistan and Central Asia. Chidambarams strategy during his stay in the US is to go beyond the political leadership in Washington and to appeal directly to the centres of intelligence and law enforcement here that if they look away from Pakistans acts of omission and commission in Mumbai, America and its interests would be at risk and could be targeted by the same forces that attacked India in November.        
	While this will be the core argument by members of Chidambarams delegation in their talks with the US intelligence community, the home minister will turn the Sharm-el-Sheikh Indo-Pakistan joint statement on its head in his discussions with the political leadership here, according to sources, which provided inputs for his talking points here.         
	Chidambarams interpretation of the joint statement during his meetings with US secretary of state Hillary Clinton and others here will be that Pakistan cannot make the resumption of bilateral dialogue a condition for its investigation of cross-border terrorism or prosecution of its perpetrators within their country.         
	It is understood that in the face of severe domestic criticism of the joint statement, Indias political leadership at the highest level agreed on such an interpretation for the delinking of terrorism from the resumption of talks with Islamabad. The controversial portion of the joint statement said action on terrorism should not be linked to the Composite Dialogue process and these should not be bracketed.         
	Chidambaram will tell the Americans that Pakistans action against terrorism should continue and not be linked to the dialogue process in any form. Chidambaram will tell the Americans and provide proof, if needed, that infiltration by militants across the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir has gone up from May and was continuing until the start of last month.         
	Clinton may be reminded, if the occasion arises, that it was her husband who unequivocally stated during his visit to India in 2000  and acted on the premise earlier during the Kargil war  that the LoC was sacrosanct and should be respected by Pakistan.         
	If the Americans bring up Balochistan, even in passing, Chidambaram will clearly argue that it is an internal problem of Pakistan, like Kashmir is, for India. But relations with Pakistan and follow up to the terror in Mumbai in November are only two aspects of the home ministers wide-ranging agenda in the US.        
	A less public aspect of his visit is to build on institutional exchanges between the intelligence and law enforcement agencies in India and the US, a process that was launched when Chidambarams NDA predecessor, L.K. Advani came here with a high-power team to talk to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency in breakthrough contacts.         
	After creating four National Security Group (NSG) commando units in metropolitan cities to act as first responders in the event of another terrorist attack, Chidambaram began his trip studying the creation of similar groups by the New York police department after the attack on the citys World Trade Centre towers on September 11. India may consider seeking training by the New York police for the nearly 2,200 NSG first responders that the home ministry plans to train at Manesar specifically for anti-terrorism work.

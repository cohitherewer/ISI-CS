	New Delhi, Sept. 17: The Congress continued to get electoral shocks, losing two Assembly bypolls today in its fiefdom Delhi where, unlike Gujarat, no Narendra Modi factor was at work.        
	The overwhelming view is that the Dwarka and Okhla seats were lost because tickets were given to relatives of senior leaders. The setbacks came after the Congress defied a 10-year anti-incumbency to retain Delhi, including both the seats, last year.        
	In Dwarka, sitting MLA Mahabal Mishra became an MP and managed to get a ticket for his relative Tilottama Chaudhary.        
	Senior Delhi leader Tajdar Babars son Farhad Suri was fielded from Okhla, a Muslim-dominated seat important for the Congress as the Batla House encounter had created bitterness among the voters. The bypoll to the Okhla seat was necessitated by four-time MLA Pervez Hashmis election to the Rajya Sabha.        
	Supporters of both chief minister Sheila Dikshit and Delhi Congress chief Jaiprakash Agrawal admitted that family control in ticket distribution had boomeranged on the party.        
	Congressmen concede that resentment among the ranks against the dynastic tradition is growing. The Nehru-Gandhi family is viewed as an isolated and deserving exception but the leaders feel this cannot be legitimised at every level in the party.        
	In Okhla, for instance, Hashmi didnt help the Congress candidate, seen as an outsider and defeated by the RJDs Mohammad Asif, who had lost the polls last year.

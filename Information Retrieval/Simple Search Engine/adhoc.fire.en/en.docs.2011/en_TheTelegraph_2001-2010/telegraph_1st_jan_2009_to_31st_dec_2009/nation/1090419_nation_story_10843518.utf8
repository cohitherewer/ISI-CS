The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Farooq pitted against sister
                                                                                                               Farooq pitted against sister
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                        Farooq Abdullah; Khalida Shah (below) in Srinagar				                                       
	Srinagar, April 18: Kashmirs First Family is taking its dispute to the peoples court.        
	The Srinagar constituency will witness a contest between Farooq Abdullah and younger sister Khalida Shah, both claiming the legacy of their father, Sheikh Abdullah.        
	The family infighting dates back to 1982 when Sheikh Abdullah nominated Farooq as his successor in the National Conference, annoying Khalida who was expecting her husband, Ghulam Mohammad Shah, to don the mantle. Shah took his revenge by dislodging Farooq from the chief ministers post in 1984 by engineering a split in the party. Farooq returned to power in 1986 with Congress support.        
	We are the inheritors of my fathers legacy; we have never compromised our agenda on Kashmir, said Khalida, 71, who heads the Awami National Conference. I have nothing against my brother; what we want is redress of the peoples grievances.        
	Farooq has pledged not to issue statements against Khalidas party: My conscience wont allow me to do so.        
	If voted to power, Ill ensure release of all political prisoners and prepare the ground for tripartite talks to resolve the Kashmir issue, Khalida said. Farooq said he would be a bridge between the separatists and Delhi so that the dialogue process resumes and steps are taken to resolve the Kashmir issue.        
	Brother and sister were close to a contest in the 2008 state polls but Khalida opted out after Ghulams condition deteriorated. When he died last January, Farooq and his chief minister son Omar Abdullah visited Khalidas home for the first time since 1984.

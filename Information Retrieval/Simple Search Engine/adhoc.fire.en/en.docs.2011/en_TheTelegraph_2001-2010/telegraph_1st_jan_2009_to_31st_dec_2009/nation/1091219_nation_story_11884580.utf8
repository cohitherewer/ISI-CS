The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hole in deemed varsity curbs

          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 18: At least a dozen deemed universities continue to call themselves full-fledged varsities despite an order to end the controversial practice that could potentially fool students, thanks to a human resource development ministry error.        
	These institutions are allowed the special treatment because of a notification issued by the University Grants Commission (UGC) within days of the ministrys August 2009 order asking deemed universities to drop the word university from their names, sources said.        
	These select institutions include at least six in Karnataka, three in Haryana, and one each in Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand.        
	The governments argument for allowing the privilege to these institutions involves the manner in which they were granted deemed university status.        
	In most cases, notifications granting deemed university status do not refer to the institution as a full-fledged varsity. But in some cases, institutions were granted deemed university status with names that already included the word university.        
	The UGC notification granting the exemption to these select institutions cites the example of Lingayas University. This institution is actually a deemed university, but the HRD ministry notification granting it deemed university status states, without explanation, that it is to be called Lingayas University.        
	Most such instances occurred after the HRD ministry and the UGC  under then minister Arjun Singh  allowed all deemed universities to drop the word deemed from their names. At the time, we notified deemed university status for some institutions naming them universities in the notification  because we had allowed them to drop the word deemed in any case. In retrospect, it was an error, a government source said.        
	New HRD minister Kapil Sibal asked his ministry in July to reverse the decision to allow deemed universities to call themselves universities. The UGC issued an order on August 19 banning the practice, and publicised this notification on its website.        
	But later the same month, it issued another order, which was not placed on the website, indicating exemption for institutions that were named universities in the notification granting them deemed varsity status.

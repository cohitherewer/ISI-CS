          OUR BUREAU                      SM Krishna with Yang Jiechi at the meeting in Bangalore on Tuesday. (PTI)                          
	Oct. 27: A Russia-India-China (RIC) forum today backed New Delhis aspirations for a bigger UN role amid signs the grouping could turn from a chatter club to a bulwark in pressuring the West on key issues.        
	The joint statement issued after the ninth RIC trilateral meeting in Bangalore said: The (foreign) ministers of India, Russia and China reiterated that their countries attach importance to the status of India in international affairs, and understand and support Indias aspirations to play a greater role in the United Nations.        
	The endorsement, which came after discussions covering pressing issues such as terrorism, health and agriculture, is significant as it shows the RIC meeting has broken out of diplomatically inconsequential themes of the past like disaster management and flood control.        
	The statement is also important because it includes China with which India has been engaged in a war of words in recent weeks.        
	External affairs minister S.M. Krishna held separate talks with his Chinese counterpart Yang Jiechi for an hour and half this evening where some of the irritants in bilateral ties were taken up.        
	We had fruitful exchange of views on all aspects of bilateral relations. We both see this (meeting) as part of building trust and understanding at the political level, Krishna said after the talks.        
	The minister didnt disclose what was discussed but the Indian side is said to have voiced concern over a dam being built on the Brahmaputra by China, issue of stapled visas to Indians from Kashmir and Chinese projects under way in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.        
	The Krishna-Yang talks came two days after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao in Thailand.         
	The RIC meeting also touched on Afghanistan, stressing the need for greater involvement of the three Asian powers in the reconstruction of the war-torn country. We cannot stand aloof and impartial in what is going on in the friendly neighbouring countries and adjacent countries. So we are all taking interest in the restoration of peace and stability in Afghanistan, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said after the meeting.

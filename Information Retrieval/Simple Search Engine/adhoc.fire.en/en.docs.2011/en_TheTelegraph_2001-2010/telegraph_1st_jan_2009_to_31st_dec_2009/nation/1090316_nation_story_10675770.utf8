                                                                                                               BJP readies manifesto
          SANJAY K. JHA                               
	New Delhi, March 15: The BJP will release its own manifesto for this general election to explain its position on ideological matters in addition to the NDAs agenda of governance.         
	Issues like the Ram temple, Ram setu, the Amarnath land row, the UPA governments perceived anti-Hindu mindset and its approach to tackle terror would find prominent mention. The manifesto, sources said, should be out in the next two weeks.        
	The BJP went with a common NDA manifesto in 1999 to stress the importance of coalition dharma. The document did not mention any of the BJPs pet themes then  the Ram temple, the uniform civil code and Article 370. Instead, it spoke of emotional harmony of all Indians and full protection to minorities.        
	For the 2004 elections, however, after five years of NDA rule under Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the BJP released a separate vision document with all the contentious issues.         
	While the NDAs agenda for governance focused on policies, the BJP vision document promised a magnificent Ram temple in Ayodhya and uniform civil code through consensus. The trend is set to continue for this election, sources said. The BJP also plans to infuse a heavy dose of populism in the manifesto highlighting schemes that have seen success in states ruled by the party.         
	The Rs 2 a kg rice scheme in Chhattisgarh and the Ladli Laxmi programme for the girl child in Madhya Pradesh would be promoted by the BJP at the national level. Gujarats Jyotirgram Yojna  a rural electricity scheme  is another scheme under consideration.         
	The manifesto will also have specific proposals for women, youths and farmers. The IT vision document released by L.K. Advani yesterday was a step in that direction. The document promises to create 1.2 crore IT-enabled jobs in rural India, lower input costs for farmers, enhance rural efficiency, create multi-purpose identity cards for all citizens, bring laptops priced at Rs 10,000 for 10 million students and a cellphone to every below-poverty-line home.        
	It also talks of interest-free loans to poor students to buy computers. The document, which showcases Advanis ambitions for the youth, envisages a revolution in education through Internet-enabled classrooms in villages. It also seeks to modernise disaster management, healthcare and public administration.

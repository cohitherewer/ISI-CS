The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sibal bill in ministers lap
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Sibal bill in ministers lap
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 4: A proposed law to set up a new higher education accreditation regime may be vetted first by a group of ministers, delaying the bill but uniting the government in the defence of key education reforms.         
	Human resource development minister Kapil Sibal plans to ask the cabinet to refer the proposed law to a group of ministers (GoM) after the Prime Minister insisted that two other reform legislation be vetted by GoMs first.         
	The Telegraph has learnt Sibal is keen to volunteer  before the cabinet  that a GoM discuss a bill for a national authority for regulation of accreditation in higher education. He may propose the cabinet take up the bill after the GoMs nod. It is extremely rare for a ministry piloting legislation to seek the intervention of a GoM. Only the cabinet can refer a bill to it. A GoM is only appointed when the cabinet feels that a legislation drafted by a ministry contains loopholes or problems that a political body needs to resolve.         
	Referring bills to a GoM also means placing them on the legislative backburner for a while  as GoMs take at least a few weeks to finalise their views on a bill.         
	But Sibal, sources said, feels a nod from a GoM  where constituent ministers study and debate a bill in detail  would strengthen him politically, while introducing reforms that some sections have opposed. A GoM nod will mean that the bill will be the baby of all constituent ministers. The HRD minister will not be alone defending the bill, a source said.        
	The HRD minister was keen to introduce reform bills punishing colleges that charge capitation fees or cheat students with false claims and setting up special tribunals to resolve education-related disputes in this session of Parliament.         
	But at the cabinet meeting yesterday evening, where both these bills were taken up, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh himself suggested that the bills be referred to a GoM.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bangalore, March 2: A young BPO employee apparently suffocated to death after robbers gagged him and his wife at their home this morning before leaving with their booty.        
	Umesh Krishnan, 27, a senior executive with the BPO arm of Infosys, was woken up around 5am by knocks on the door, the police complaint lodged by his wife Anne Mary said.        
	Four persons entered the first-floor apartment at Banaswadi, east Bangalore, overpowered Krishnan and tied him to a chair with adhesive tape. They also taped his mouth.         
	Police suspect the tape suffocated and killed him, but are waiting for the post-mortem report.        
	Mary was in her room, unwell. When the gang gagged her too with tape, she fainted.        
	She regained consciousness around 6.30am and dragged herself out of the apartment to alert the neighbours below. She has been admitted to hospital.        
	There were several loops of tape around Krishnans mouth and jaw and two loops around his legs, a policeman said. There was a bit of tape across Marys mouth and a single loop around her wrists.        
	The couple usually travelled to Erode, Krishnans hometown in Tamil Nadu and a six-hour drive from Bangalore, over the weekends, said a neighbour who did not want to be identified. It could not be ascertained, though, if Krishnan had this Sunday off.        
	Marys complaint said the robbers left with two mobile phones, some cash and jewellery worth Rs 75,000. Deputy commissioner of police B.K. Singh said a case of robbery and murder had been registered.        
	Krishnan and Mary, who married last October, had shifted to the apartment on January 4. The building has some 10 flats, many of them occupied by BPO employees.        
	He (Krishnan) had completed three years (at the company) a few days ago, said a person known to a few employees, adding he did not want to be named.        
	The killing comes two weeks after a retired professor who taught mathematics at the Indian Institute of Science was murdered with his wife and son in Bangalore.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bhopal poison still lingers

  - Toxic traces in water          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A physically challenged boy in Bhopal on Tuesday sings at a ceremony to mark the 25th anniversary of the Union Carbide gas leak. (Reuters)                                        
	New Delhi, Dec. 1: Toxic residues from the Union Carbide factory that spewed a poisonous gas into Bhopals environment 25 years ago continue to contaminate soil and water in the city, a non-government organisation claimed today.         
	The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said it has detected unacceptably high levels of pesticide residues in groundwater samples from an area up to 3km from the factory, which was the site of the worlds worst industrial disaster in 1984.         
	A tank in the factory had leaked a gas called methyl isocyanate on the night of December 2-3, 1984, turning the city into a gas chamber, killing an estimated 3,700 persons and causing lung injury and illness to tens of thousands more.         
	The CSE analysed 11 groundwater samples from neighbourhoods around the factory in October this year and found all samples contained potentially toxic residues of specific chemicals that were being made in the factory, the NGOs officials said. The concentrations of these residues were 1.1 to 38.6 times higher than limits prescribed by standard-setting authorities in India, the CSE said.         
	A water sample from a hand-operated pump in the area had the highest level of carbaryl  110 times the limit. Soil samples from within the factory also had high levels of carbaryl and other contaminants, the NGO said.         
	The factory site in Bhopal is leading to chronic toxicity  continuous tiny exposure leading to poisoning, said Sunita Narain, director of the CSE. The chemical residues in the soil are leaching into the groundwater and getting transported away from the site.         
	The CSE said the residues were likely to contribute to slow poisoning of the population exposed to the contaminated water. Chlorinated benzene compounds may adversely affect blood cells and the liver, while organochlorine pesticides can lead to cancer.         
	The CSE analysis did not take into account residues elsewhere as control samples.         
	We didnt have to do that because we were looking at residues that are signature degradation products of the chemicals that were made at the factory, said Kushal Yadav, a CSE analyst.         
	The Madhya Pradesh governments Bhopal Gas Tragedy Relief and Rehabilitation Department has spent Rs 29 crore over the past 18 years on environmental rehabilitation such as planting trees, creating green belts and improving water supply programmes. But it has classified the disposal of hazardous industrial wastes and residues lying in the Union Carbide plant as work under progress.         
	Narain said the waste stored in the factory was only a small part of the contamination issue. The focus of the government to just dispose of the stored waste and ignore site contamination is not going to solve environmental problems from the factory, she said in a statement issued in Bhopal today.

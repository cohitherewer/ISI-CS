	Calcutta, June 4: A Left Front meeting today discussed the possibility of reverting to the academic session starting in January in Bengal, but the meeting ended without any agreement.        
	The RSP and Forward Bloc supported the January move, instead of mid-summer at present. But the CPM-controlled All Bengal Teachers Association was sceptical.         
	Left Front chairman Biman Bose and school education minister Partha De brought up the plan.         
	The feasibility of holding separate exams for Classes IX and X was also explored.

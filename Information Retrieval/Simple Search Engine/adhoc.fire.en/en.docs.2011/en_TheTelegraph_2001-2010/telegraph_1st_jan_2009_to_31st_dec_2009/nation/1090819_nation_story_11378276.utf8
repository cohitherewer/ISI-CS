The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Minister shuffle on Cong cards
                                                                                                               Minister shuffle on Cong cards
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 18: Five ministers who also hold posts in the Congresss central apparatus are likely to shed their organisational responsibilities by the end of August and focus on their ministries.         
	They are Ghulam Nabi Azad, Mukul Wasnik, Prithviraj Chavan and V. Narayanasamy all general secretaries minding states  and M. Veerappa Moily, with independent charge of Assam and Andhra.        
	However, Union ministers A.K. Antony, Pranab Mukherjee and C.P. Joshi are expected to continue with their party work. Mukherjee will remain Bengal Congress president and Joshi will continue to head the party in Rajasthan.        
	Party sources said the impending shuffle would keep in mind caste, community and religious considerations while appointing new office-bearers to correct anomalies such as under-representation of Dalits, minorities and women in Sonia Gandhis crack team.        
	It seems the ministers wanted to continue in the party because of the perception that the real power rested in 24 Akbar Road, the Congress headquarters. Given the flak some of them  like Azad and Moily  recently faced, party leaders concluded a dual role was not in the fitness of things.

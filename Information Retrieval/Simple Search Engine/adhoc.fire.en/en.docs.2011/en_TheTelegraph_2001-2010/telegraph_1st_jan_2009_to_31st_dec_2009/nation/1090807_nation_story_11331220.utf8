The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mamata effect: land bills shelved
                                                                                                               Mamata effect: land bills shelved
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Mamata                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 6: The UPA government has indefinitely postponed the re-introduction of the land acquisition and rehabilitation bills in Parliament in deference to the wishes of Mamata Banerjee.        
	The Land Acquisition (Amendment) Bill, 2007, and the Rehabilitation and Resettlement Bill, 2007, were slated to be re-introduced in the Rajya Sabha tomorrow, the last day of the budget session.         
	The Centre had planned to table them in Parliament and refer them to the standing committee of the rural development ministry. The move would have bought time and, more important, peace with key ally Mamata.         
	However, from Day One, the Trinamul Congress made it clear that the draft bills were unacceptable in their present forms. Mamata was against the 70:30 ratio that would enable private promoters to buy a maximum of 70 per cent of the land required for an industrial project and allow the state government to acquire the remaining 30 per cent, if required.        
	The Trinamul chief objected to government intervention in the acquisition process for industrial purposes because her agitations in Singur and Nandigram were based on opposition to the forcible land take-over by the state.        
	Over the past two days, Mamata has reiterated her reservations to top Congress ministers, emphasising that it would politically hurt the Congress as much as Trinamul if the government went ahead with the bills.        
	She allegedly told them the Lefts stand would be vindicated because it had been asking for a larger government role in land acquisition. She warned that the move would harm the underpinning of their collective agenda. Irked by the ministers cool response, Mamata spoke to Sonia yesterday, Congress sources said.        
	They added that Sonia was focused on a single goal: wrest Bengal from the Left in the 2011 Assembly elections. To attain this, she is absolutely clear that the Trinamul alliance must not be jeopardised, a source said.        
	What to do? asked a hapless cabinet minister from the Congress. These are the compulsions of coalition politics.        
	Rural development minister C.P. Joshi, whose ministry piloted the bills, said: These are matters that are decided by the parliamentary affairs minister. I have no role.        
	Till Tuesday, a cabinet minister closely monitoring the destiny of the bills had maintained that they would be brought in during this session.        
	The two bills had been passed by the Lok Sabha this year towards the end of the UPAs first term. But they were stalled in the Rajya Sabha because of Left opposition.         
	The Congress sources said Mamata was a member of the cabinet that had cleared the Presidents address in June which mentioned the UPAs commitment to introducing the bills within 100 days of the government  something Sonia was keen on.         
	Mamata had also ratified the bills so that they could meet the 100-day deadline. She cannot go against the principle of collective responsibility, a source stressed.        
	BJP sources who interacted with the governments floor managers claimed they were given to understand that the bills would see the light of day on the last day of the session.         
	A chuffed Trinamul minister remarked: First, the Congress ceded the two bypoll seats to us, now they have agreed to shelve the bills.

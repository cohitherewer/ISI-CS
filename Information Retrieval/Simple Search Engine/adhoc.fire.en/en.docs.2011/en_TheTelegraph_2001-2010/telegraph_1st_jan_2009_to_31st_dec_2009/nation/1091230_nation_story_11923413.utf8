	New Delhi, Dec. 29 (PTI): The Centre today cleared a proposal to raise the salary of faculty members of medical institutes like AIIMS and the Indira Gandhi Regional Institute of Health and Medical Science, Shillong, bringing them on a par with their counterparts in IITs and IIMs.        
	The faculties of two more institutes in the Northeast, the Lokapriya Gopinath Bordoloi Regional Institute of Mental Health, Tezpur, and the Regional Institute of Medical Sciences, Imphal, will get Sixth Pay Commission benefits.        
	The faculty of these institutes had refused to accept the revised emoluments recommended by the Sixth Pay Commission, demanding pay similar to that in the IIMs and IITs.        
	The new pay scales will be implemented with retrospective effect from January 1, 2006, while allowances will be paid with effect from September 1, 2008.        
	The other institutes that have been brought on a par with the IITs and IIMs include PGI Chandigarh, Nimhans, Bangalore and the Jawaharlal Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education and Research, Puducherry.

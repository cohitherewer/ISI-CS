          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          BJD chief Naveen Patnaik at the foundation day celebration of his party on Saturday. (Sanjib Mukherjee)                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 26: Faced with the Oppositions tirade against alleged mine scams and the farmer suicides, chief minister Naveen Patnaik today called upon BJD party workers to maintain mass contact and ensure public confidence in his government.        
	People of Orissa have been supporting our party during all the elections. We have to strive hard to keep the popular support intact, Naveen said, while addressing party leaders and workers on the 13th foundation day function of ruling BJD here today.        
	BJD has won three Assembly polls, four Lok Sabha elections, two panchayat and as many civic polls since it came into being in December 2007, and established itself as the longest surviving regional party in Orissa. In the recent Assembly polls in April-May this year, the regional outfit achieved absolute majority in the 147-member House, even as it broke an 11-year-old alliance with BJP.        
	Though Naveen set a record of being elected as chief minister of Orissa for three consecutive terms, his government has found itself in a tizzy within six months after the election with Opposition Congress and BJP launching a combined attack on alleged multi-crore mines scam and farmer suicides.         
	Without mentioning the mining scam and farmer suicides, the BJD chief today exhorted the party workers to retain public confidence, the largest asset of the fledgling regional outfit, by spreading the message of achievements of his government.        
	Listing out the anti-poverty and populist schemes launched by his government, Naveen said schemes like Rs 2 per kg rice, Mo Kudia (My Hut) and Madhubabu Pension Yojana had provided sustenance to the poor.         
	State agriculture minister and BJD secretary-general Damodar Rout said frustrated over their electoral defeat, traditional foes Congress and BJP had joined hands and resorted to false propaganda to defame the BJD government.

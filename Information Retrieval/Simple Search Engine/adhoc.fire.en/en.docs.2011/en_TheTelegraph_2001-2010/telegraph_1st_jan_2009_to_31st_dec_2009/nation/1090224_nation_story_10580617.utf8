The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Wary CPM shies off new faces
                                                                                                               Wary CPM shies off new faces
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 23: The CPM will field most of its Bengal MPs, except those axed because of delimitation, backing off plans for big changes because of the threat from the proposed Congress-Trinamul alliance.        
	The changes will be done in one-fourth to one-sixth of the seats. The party cant afford to drop old-timers, a secretariat member said. Tomorrows state committee meeting could finalise the list.        
	No decision has been taken on Lakshman Seth, the Tamluk MP blamed for the Nandigram fiasco. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and industries minister Nirupam Sen are said to be against Seths re-nomination, though some are backing him. I dont think votes will rain if Lakshman is replaced, party veteran Benoy Konar said.        
	Birbhum MP Ramchandra Dom will be fielded from Bolpur, now represented by Somnath Chatterjee. Birbhum has been de-reserved and Bolpur reserved for Scheduled Castes.

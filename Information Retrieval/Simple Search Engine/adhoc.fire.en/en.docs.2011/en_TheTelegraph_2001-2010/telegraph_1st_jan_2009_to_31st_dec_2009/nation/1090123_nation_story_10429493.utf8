The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Left eyes peeled on BJP allies
                                                                                                               Left eyes peeled on BJP allies
  - CPM mulls Orissa tie-up after Naveen feelers, CPI sounds out Dal (U) in Bihar        JAYANTH JACOB                               Bhattacharjee (top), Patnaik: Friends again?				                                       
	New Delhi, Jan. 22: The Left parties have set their sights on BJP allies, especially the Biju Janata Dal and the Janata Dal (United), as they look to form a non-BJP, non-Congress alliance at the Centre.        
	The BJD leadership has sent feelers to top CPM leaders, including Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, for a possible understanding, Left sources said.         
	Naveen Patnaiks BJD is getting increasingly uncomfortable with the BJP and there are signs that it might join the third alternative at the Centre, the sources said.         
	The anti-Christian violence in Orissas Kandhamal district was a point of discord between the BJP and the BJD, the Left sources said. The violence erupted after the murder of a Vishwa Hindu Parishad leader.        
	At that time, the CPMs stand was not seeking chief minister Naveen Patnaiks resignation but urging him to snap ties with the BJP, the Left sources pointed out.        
	The CPMs last central committee meeting, in Kochi, discussed the BJDs growing discomfort with the BJP, the sources said.         
	The historic ties between the Left and Biju Patnaik, the father of Naveen Patnaik, in the state have also been discussed. The relations were severed in 1998 in the wake of the BJDs decision to support the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre.         
	In the 147-member Orissa Assembly, the BJD has 61 members and has had to take the help of 32 BJP members to form the government. But the mood within the BJD was upbeat after its victory in the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation elections in December. The party won 40 of the total 60 wards after deciding to go it alone.         
	In the Cuttack Municipal Corporation polls scheduled for February, the BJD again plans to contest alone.         
	In Orissa, the Assembly polls will coincide with the general election.         
	Out of the 21 Lok Sabha seats, the BJD holds 11 and the BJP seven.         
	In the 147-member Assembly, the CPM and the CPI have one MLA each.         
	In Bihar, sources said CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan was in touch with the JD (U) leadership.         
	Left sources said they had between 3 to 4 per cent votes in the state.

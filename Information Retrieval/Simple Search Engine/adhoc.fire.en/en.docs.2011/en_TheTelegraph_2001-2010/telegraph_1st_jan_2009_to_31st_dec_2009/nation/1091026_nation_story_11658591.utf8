          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                          The Dalai Lama greets the crowd before a panel discussion in Vancouver in September.                                        
	Kibithu, Oct. 25: Every time an Indian soldier in this border town tries to send an SMS to his family back home, he thanks the Chinese.        
	The nearest BSNL phone is 30km away.        
	At the India-China border in Arunachal Pradesh, it is Chinese mobile technology versus Indian wireless.        
	China set up Airtel and Vodafone towers in May. One of the towers at Sama village on the other side is clearly visible from Kibithu, the easternmost town on the eastern front.        
	Even a Delhi Airtel connection with this correspondent came alive with CHN CMCC Airtel on the display screen although, without international roaming, it couldnt send a message.        
	For Indian defence personnel and intelligence agencies, all official communication means falling back on what Alexander Graham Bell invented more than a century ago.        
	For all official work, we are still compelled to send couriers or use the good old wireless network to send messages, said an intelligence agent at the border.        
	The Internet is only a dream for the Indian soldier here.        
	The nearest satellite phone that India set up three months ago is about 30km away in Walong, a small cantonment and administrative town in Anjaw district.        
	About 160km away in Chaglagam, taking time off from acclimatising patrols, a lieutenant colonel queued up at the Halo phone (that the BSNL satellite phone system is branded) to call his family.        
	These satellite phones had been installed in a low-key reaction to the mobile telephone network that got very strong from the Chinese side.        
	Far away from their homes, Indian defence personnel often use Chinese connection for sending messages to their families.        
	Please write about the lack of telephone network here, many people in the area even use the Airtel network on the other side, said a soldier of the 20 Sikh regiment, dropping the veneer of restraint.        
	There isnt any need for restraint. Everyone here complains about every facet of infrastructure development in this border region.        
	Even 47 years after the Battle of Walong, when the Indian Army battled Chinese advances in what turned out to be one of the bloodiest fights of the 1962 war, the Indian government hasnt built roads in several border areas.        
	The road from Walong to Kibithu was built only a few years ago. In places like Tuting and Taksing, soldiers have to walk six days to border outposts.        
	The already sparse population in border areas of Arunachal has been dwindling further because of this lack of infrastructure. Delhis stock argument has been that vast swathes of this mountainous terrain are uninhabited.        
	But Delhi should also heed the counter-arguments. Within a year, I have seen the number of villages increase from 14 to about 30. They are farming in communes, I believe, said a source in Kibithu.        
	In Anjaw district, at least two hamlets, one of them called Nazong, have ceased to exist because of lack of infrastructure.        
	Sources said many residents of the border areas have moved to the Lohit district headquarters of Tezu, which has become a melting pot of the Miju-Mismi and Digaru-Mismi tribes of Lohit and Anjaw districts.        
	The states finance minister and legislator from Anjaw, Kalikho Pul, summed it up. Make roads, construct power projects and give me the resources, he told The Telegraph, and I will convince people to settle in border areas.

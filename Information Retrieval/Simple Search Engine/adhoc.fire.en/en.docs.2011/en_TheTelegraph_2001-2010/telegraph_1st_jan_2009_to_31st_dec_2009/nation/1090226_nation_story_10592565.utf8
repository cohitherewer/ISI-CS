          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                                    
	Mumbai, Feb. 25: Over 400 pages of the chargesheet in the Mumbai terror attack case are devoted to details of Pakistani involvement.        
	As many as 35 Pakistanis are named as accused, including Lashkar-e-Toiba commander Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi and two names prefixed with armed forces ranks: a major general and a colonel.        
	Joint commissioner (crime) Rakesh Maria said police were investigating whether the two were serving officers or Lashkar operatives. Crime branch sources said the two names had come up during the interrogation of Fahim Ansari and Sabauddin, the Indian Lashkar operatives believed to be part of the conspiracy.        
	Both mentioned a certain Colonel Kayani in particular. He should not be confused with Pakistan army chief General Ashfaq Kiyani though. We had shown them his picture to be doubly sure, but they could not identify him, said a source. Not every Pakistani mentioned in the chargesheet was named in the dossier given by the Indian government to Pakistan. Their names came up later, Maria added.        
	The names of accused Pakistanis  alive and wanted but unable to be brought to trial  figure in Column 2 of the chargesheet. Maria said it would enable the police to seek non-bailable warrants against them and subsequently Interpol Red Corner notices.        
	The names include Hamad Amin Sadiq, identified by Pakistan as the key conspirator in the Mumbai attacks. The Pakistani nationals are mostly Lashkar members, or people close to the Lashkar who participated in launching the 26/11 attack. It has been established in the chargesheet that the Lashkars marine wing orchestrated the attack, Maria said.        
	The chargesheet is understood to detail evidence collected by Americas FBI, including lengthy transcripts of conversations between the gunmen and their handlers as well as security camera footage of the terrorists attacking Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus.        
	With GPS logs, call records, transcripts, VoIP communications and footages, this chargesheet comprises the most high-tech forensic evidence produced in an Indian court, Maria said.

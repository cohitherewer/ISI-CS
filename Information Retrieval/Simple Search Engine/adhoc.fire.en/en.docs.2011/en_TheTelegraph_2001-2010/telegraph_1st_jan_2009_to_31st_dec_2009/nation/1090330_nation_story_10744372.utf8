The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Troika to talk pre-poll strategy
                                                                                                               Troika to talk pre-poll strategy
                            
	New Delhi, March 29 (PTI): The troika of Lalu Prasad, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Ram Vilas Paswan will meet on April 3 to chalk out a campaign strategy for the Lok Sabha election.        
	Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Amar Singh today said: We three (RJD, LJP and SP) will fight jointly in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Though we announced this alliance earlier, we need to sit down and chalk out a long-term strategy. The meeting, to be held here tomorrow, will now be held in Lucknow.        
	Singh regretted that his party failed to strike up an understanding with the Congress, despite leaving 17 seats for it, as against the three or four granted by other allies.         
	They came out with a list of 24 candidates, 10 of who were pitted against our sitting MPs. We felt betrayed.        
	He said the Congress did not yield to SPs request to let it contest one seat in Maharashtra and said that his party had spoken to Congress president Sonia Gandhi regarding the matter.         
	He also made it clear that if the Congress faced any setbacks on account of vote cutting, the SP should not be blamed for it.        
	Singh also pointed out that the Congress did not agree to give SP any seat in Bengal.         
	We would have been happy with any seat, anywhere in the state. If they dont relent, then we will put up at least 10 candidates in the state.        
	He asserted that the SP would put up a fight if no understanding is reached in these states (Bengal and Maharashtra).         
	We deploy all our campaigners such as Sanjay Dutt, Jaya Bachchan and Jayaprada and Manoj Tiwari for the purpose, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Three cheers before festival season
                                                                                                               Three cheers before festival season
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	New Delhi, Sept. 10: The Centre today announced additional dearness allowance for its employees and interest subsidy for home loan subscribers and farmers, unwrapping a Rs 9,355-crore package on the eve of the festive season and in the run-up to Assembly elections.        
	The purse-strings were loosened within days of the government ordering its departments to tighten their belt and ministers to avoid staying in five-star hotels.        
	But two of the steps  the 5 per cent additional dearness allowance and the 1 per cent home loan subsidy  were more in the nature of meeting administrative requirements.        
	While the government had already announced the home loan subsidy earlier, the rising consumer price index has made the increase in dearness allowance unavoidable. The farm subsidy appears to have been prompted by the drought-like conditions prevailing in several parts of the country.        
	Home loans        
	The home loan subsidy will be applicable only to homes valued up to Rs 20 lakh. The housing subsidy of 1 per cent will be available for first 12 EMIs (equated monthly instalments) on loans up to Rs 10 lakh for houses costing up to Rs 20 lakh, said Ambika Soni, the information and broadcasting minister, briefing reporters on the outcome of the cabinet meeting.        
	In July, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had announced the home subsidy scheme during his reply to the discussion on the Finance Bill in the Lok Sabha.         
	The interest rate change will be routed through scheduled commercial banks and the housing finance companies registered with the National Housing Bank, Soni said.        
	Last December, too, the government had announced a concessional interest rate scheme for housing loans as part of the first fiscal stimulus package to revive the economy. The Indian Banks Association (IBA) had accordingly worked out an interest rate of 8.5 per cent for fresh home loans below Rs 5 lakh and 9.25 per cent for loans between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 20 lakh.        
	Now the rate for loans up to Rs 10 lakh will drop another percentage point. However, home loans for those borrowing larger amounts will rule between 9-12 per cent.         
	DA raised        
	The dearness allowance increase with retrospective effect addresses the price spike on the ground. Although the wholesale price index, which gives greater weightage to industrial products, has been falling week after week, the consumer price index, which focuses on food and daily necessities, has been going up relentlessly.        
	The DA hike is expected to benefit some eight million central government employees and pensioners. From July 1 this year, they will be entitled to dearness allowance of 27 per cent of basic pay.        
	The raise will be paid to them in October, besides the remaining 60 per cent of arrears arising from the pay commission recommendation.        
	The officials said the release of the money would help perk up demand for consumer goods and housing, the arrears acting as a stimulus package for the economy as a whole. The domestic consumer durables industry and automakers have been pinning their hopes on the release of arrears to increase sales during the festival season.        
	Farm loan relief        
	Officials said the 2 per cent interest subsidy to banks for granting farmers short-term crop loans up to Rs 3 lakh would bring down interest rates to 7 per cent from 9 per cent. Those who pay back loans on time will get an extra 1 per cent subsidy, bringing down their loan rate to 6 per cent.        
	During 2008-09, banks lent Rs 2,87,000 crore to farmers. The government has set the target of Rs 3,25,000 crore for the current financial year.

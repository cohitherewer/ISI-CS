The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rajasthan hurls a bouncer at Lalit
                                                                                                               Rajasthan hurls a bouncer at Lalit
          RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR                          Modi: Jaipur jolt                                  
	Jaipur, June 15: Indian Premier League boss Lalit Modis Rajasthan connection may just be over.        
	Modi cannot any more contest elections to the Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA), whose presidentship had gained him a foothold in crickets big league and powered his meteoric rise.        
	An RCA general body meeting yesterday endorsed a constitution drafted on January 27, 2005, which says only someone domiciled (resident for 10 years) in Rajasthan can contest its elections. Modi has never lived in Rajasthan.        
	Modis exit from the Rajasthan association will have no bearing on his position in the Board of Control for Cricket in India, where he is vice-president, or the IPL. He is also a vice-president in the Punjab Cricket Association, and can use that connection to keep fighting BCCI polls.        
	Modi had contested the RCA polls in February 2005 before the new constitution could be adopted, and become president. He had then vested absolute powers in the president and overruled the domicile clause. He, however, lost the next election on March 1 this year.        
	Current RCA president Sanjay Dixit told The Telegraph: We adopted the 2005 constitution through a circular (after the last election) but the Supreme Court asked us to adopt it in the general body. We only reconfirmed the constitution yesterday.        
	Modi, who belongs to the family that owns the Rs 4,000-crore Modi Enterprises, spent his childhood in Delhi and boarding schools in Nainital and Shimla. He now lives in Mumbai.        
	In September 2004, Modi had bought farmland in Nagaur, 290km west of Jaipur, to show himself as a Rajasthan resident before the 2005 state association elections that he won. Recently, a farmer from Gogor village in Nagaur, Roopa Ram Jat, alleged that Modi had bought the plot with the help of forged signatures.        
	Just before the March elections, then RCA secretary and Modis arch-rival, Subhas Joshi, had held a meeting and got a resolution passed barring Modi from contesting the polls.        
	The meeting had cited two reasons: that Modi was not a Rajasthan resident and that he had failed to disclose having been caught with drugs as a student in the US.        
	The apex court, however, had come to Modis rescue, asking the RCA to hold the elections under its undisputed (old) constitution.

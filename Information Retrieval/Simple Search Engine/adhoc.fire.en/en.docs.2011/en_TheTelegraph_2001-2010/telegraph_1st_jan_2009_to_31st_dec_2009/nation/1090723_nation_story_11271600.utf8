	New Delhi, July 22: The National Human Rights Commission has given Delhi police a clean chit in last Septembers Batla House shootout, saying the cops fired in self-defence.        
	Having regard to the material placed before us, it cannot be said there has been any violation of human rights by the action of the police party, the commission said in its report to Delhi High Court today.        
	Two suspected terrorists and inspector Mohan Chand Sharma had died in the September 18 encounter in Delhis Jamia Nagar area. One suspected militant was arrested and two fled.        
	The commission, asked to probe possible rights violations by the court this May, said its findings were based on the post-mortem reports, medical tests of an injured cop and firearms reports.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ally headache in Congress
                                                                                                               Ally headache in Congress
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, May 22: The debate over going it alone and leveraging its increased numbers to its advantage versus the compulsions of coalition politics is weighing with the Congress a week after its victory.        
	Anti-coalition voices are urging the party not to brook tantrums its allies might throw over ministerships. But partners, past and present, are quietly reminding the Congress that if it had not been for their pro-activism in the social sector, the verdict may have been different.        
	Sharad Pawars supporters have spread the word that the loan waiver idea was conceptualised and executed by him allegedly against the wishes of the finance ministry.        
	The Rashtriya Janata Dal, now estranged from the Congress, is asking its leaders why they did not credit former rural development minister Raghuvansh Prasad Singh with implementing the rural employment guarantee scheme.        
	Sources said the Congress was convinced that the loan waiver and the job scheme had not only got it rural votes, it had also enhanced Rahul Gandhis image as a leader of the poor and the farmers.        
	The first source of tension between the Congress and its allies could arise over the infrastructure and social sector ministries, the sources said.         
	The DMK has let it be known that it wants one or more of the infrastructure-related ministries but the Congress is chary of conceding them.        
	While the Congress will keep the ministries of home, defence, finance and external affairs, sources said this time around they were also keen to have rural development, surface transport and shipping and minority affairs.        
	The Congresss roadmap has flagged the re-emergence of the debate on reforms versus social inclusion, now that Mamata Banerjee and Rahul are expected to play the governments conscience-keepers and counsel against unbridled liberalisation.        
	Mamata has asked for a re-look at the policy on special economic zones.         
	The Congress stand is that land acquisition is feasible as long as it does not hurt farmers interests. But its Maharashtra government had to shelve a couple of acquisitions after peasants protested against inadequate compensation.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Row over exam move
                                                                                                               Row over exam move
          SUBRAT DAS                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 1: The decision to exempt primary school students (up to Class IV) from examinations has triggered a row, with some teachers panels demanding a rollback.        
	A senior official of the Orissa Primary Education Programme Authority, however, defended the decision and pointed out that similar practice is prevalent in Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan. We hope that by doing away with examinations, we will be providing more time to teenagers to develop their creative and intellectual sides, said an official. The decision would be in force at 3,500-odd primary schools across the state.         
	Some panels, such as the United Teachers and Employees Association is stiffly opposing the move. As association president Bikram Keshari Burma pointed out: The idea is absurd. While English-medium schools will be conducting tests almost every month, government primary schools will not do so. Finally, education standards and the quality of teaching would take a hit from this decision, he said.         
	Burma, a former ruling BJD legislator, has sought the intervention of the BJD boss and chief minister, Naveen Patnaik, and the state school and mass education minister Pratap Jena to take a firm stand against the exam bar issue.        
	Secretary general of All Orissa Federation of Teachers Organisations Abani Kumar Baral believes that while the common examination system might be abolished in primary schools, however, annual class tests should be conducted. Class tests put pressure on students to study regularly, he said.        
	For now, Jena has decided to examine the decision. My priority would be quality education and any system that impairs it will not be promoted, said Jena.

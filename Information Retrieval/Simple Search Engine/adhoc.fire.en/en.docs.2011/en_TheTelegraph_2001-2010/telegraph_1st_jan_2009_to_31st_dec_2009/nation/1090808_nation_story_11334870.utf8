The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Monkey ultimatum in House
                                                                                                               Monkey ultimatum in House
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 7: The Rajya Sabha had to sit up and take notice of a simian scare not far away. And it was no monkey business, at least not for K. Malaisamy.        
	The ADMK member today threatened to shoot at the herds that he said had been stalking him during morning walks near his quarters at South Avenue, just a few kilometres from Parliament House.        
	He said he would be forced to take the route of a gun or pistol if the authorities continued to ignore his complaints about the menace.        
	Human beings are more precious than forest beings, Malaisamy said during zero hour. The Union ministry of environment and forests should form a committee of experts, consisting of forest officials, to address the matter on a priority basis, he said.        
	Environment minister Jairam Ramesh wasnt present when Malaisamy spoke but the ADMK MP managed a rare feat: he found support from the DMKs Vasanthi Stanley.         
	The two parties, arch-rivals for years, dont see eye to eye on most things. Except, maybe, monkeys.

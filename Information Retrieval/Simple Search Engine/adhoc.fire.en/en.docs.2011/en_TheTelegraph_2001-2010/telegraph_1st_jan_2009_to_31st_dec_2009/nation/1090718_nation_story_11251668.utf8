	New Delhi, July 17: The CBI today made fresh claims on the All India Council of Technical Education bribery scam, alleging its chairman R.A. Yadav, who drew a monthly salary of about Rs 80,000, had amassed property worth crores.        
	Yesterday, the CBI had arrested a member-secretary of the regulatory body, allegedly after catching him accepting a bribe to grant recognition to a Hyderabad engineering college, and registered corruption cases against Yadav and other AICTE officials.        
	According to the agency, Yadav has Rs 1.39 crore in 17 bank accounts, a three-storey building in his wifes name, and Rs 19 lakh worth of National Saving Certificates (NSCs) and Kisan Vikas Patras.        
	The CBI raided several senior AICTE officials homes yesterday with human resource development minister Kapil Sibals go-ahead.        
	From the home and offices of AICTE adviser professor H.C. Rai in Noida, Ghaziabad and Delhi, the agency claims to have seized property documents worth crores apart from Rs 4.33 lakh in cash, fixed deposits (FDs) of Rs 2 lakh, and LIC policies of Rs 5 lakh.        
	Raids on AICTE offices in Bhopal allegedly threw up documents revealing corruption in the countrys apex technical education regulator, whose recognition is a must before any technical institute can offer any course.        
	Raids on Sanjay Sharma, the regional officer who has just been transferred from Bhopal to Mumbai, threw up NSCs worth Rs 1.45 lakh, documents for plots worth Rs 26.5 lakh and FDs of Rs 31 lakh, the CBI said.        
	However, the agency is yet to arrest anyone apart from member-secretary K. Narayan Rao and alleged middleman S.B. Subba Rao, who were today sent to CBI custody till July 20.        
	The CBI claims to have seized Rs 9 lakh in cash from Narayan Raos Delhi home as well as documents about bank accounts and properties that are being investigated. He has been framed, Raos lawyer Amit Kumar said.         
	The Professors Forum of India, the countrys largest group of non-political senior academics from central universities, has written to Sibal to initiate action against the AICTE.

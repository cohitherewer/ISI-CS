The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ex-minister warns of water crisis
                                                                                                               Ex-minister warns of water crisis
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, May 31: Orissa will face an acute water crisis by 2021, former state finance minister Panchanan Kanungo has warned in a seminar held recently.        
	Focusing on the state scenario, Kanungo said Orissa, with 4 per cent of the countrys population and 11 per cent of the countrys annual rainfall, was still well off in terms of water availability  but, only for a little while.         
	The state receives an average 1,452mm rainfall during the monsoon. But it is distributed unevenly, resulting in recurring droughts and floods, he explained.         
	As 78 per cent total surface water is available during the monsoon, only 22 per cent is available during the remaining period in the year, said Kanungo, while addressing a seminar on watershed development.        
	Quoting an official estimate, the former state finance minister said 32 billion cubic metres of water would be needed for industrial use by 2021. The water requirement for irrigation would be around 66 billion cubic metres.         
	Taking the requirement for drinking water into account, the total requirement would be around 120 billion cubic metres, he said.         
	The total demand will exceed the estimated water availability of 90 billion cubic metres, resulting in acute scarcity of water by 2021, said Kanungo.        
	He attributed the widening demand-supply gap to various factors: growing population, rapid industrialisation, expansion of urban areas, deforestation, mining, water mismanagement, climatic change, heat wave leading to speedy evaporation of water and fall in ground water levels.        
	We are going to face a critical situation unless we have an integrated management plan, he warned.        
	Apart from an integrated plan, Kanungo, who heads the Institute of Public Finance and Policy, suggested renovation of water bodies, activation of all natural drainage channels, recharge of rain water and recycling of waste water, roof-top water harvesting in urban areas and storage of flood water as the remedy for the impending water crisis.        
	He recalled that a drainage master plan at an estimated cost of Rs 480 crore and another plan for flood control were prepared in 2002. But, the plans were shelved. Had the plans been implemented, it would have helped in resolving the crisis, Kanungo said.

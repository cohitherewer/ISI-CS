The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Left wants political fight
                                                                                                               Left wants political fight
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, June 22: On a day the Centre banned the CPI (Maoist) as a terrorist organisation, the CPM and its allies opposed the tag and vowed to fight the outfit politically and through administrative action.         
	In Delhi, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat said the ban wouldnt serve any purpose and Left Front chairman Biman Bose issued a statement in Calcutta echoing him.         
	Bose said the Left partners had been facing Maoist attacks for opposing them, but the proponents of wrong politics cant be countered by banning their organisation.         
	Bose stressed a continuous political process to isolate the Maoists from their support base. And he also called for administrative measures to ensure normal public life.         
	Following a prod from home minister P. Chidambaram two days ago, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had said he was giving serious thought to banning the CPI (Maoist). But his partys stand is being perceived as a burden of its Left legacy and the political compulsion of not being seen as too close to the Congress-led Centre.         
	The CPM blames the Centres new, liberal economic policies for the rebels growing clout and its leaders said the party could not be seen as agreeing with the heavy-handed tactics of the BJP or the Congress to deal with them. The BJP and Congress governments in Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh had banned the Maoists. But that didnt stop their activities, said Shyamal Chakraborty, a member of the partys Bengal secretariat.        
	Having asked for central paramilitary support to crack down on the Maoists in Lalgarh, the party is aware that it could be accused of double standards while opposing police repression in states ruled by the Congress or the BJP if it went on to back the ban, too.         
	Concern for the sensitivities of allies like the RSP, Forward Bloc and the CPI also played a role. These allies blame the CPMs high-handedness and the states lopsided priorities in development for the increasing influence of the Maoists. Although they have backed the police action in Lalgarh because of post-poll compulsions, they harbour sympathy for the rebels.         
	Lalgarh and its adjoining areas flared up because of police excesses. The ban will only fuel the vicious circle of police and Maoist violence, an RSP leader said.        
	Bloc general secretary Debabrata Biswas and CPI state secretary Manju Mazumder pointed out the crackdown was a temporary phase that must be followed up with a political campaign and development work.         
	The Maoists are unlikely to be charmed into submission by the CPM. Its their worst political opportunism. The state government has used illegal detention and arrested suspects relatives as hostage, though it has not banned us. The state can still invoke the central ban without taking political responsibility for the move, said Sagar, a Maoist spokesman.

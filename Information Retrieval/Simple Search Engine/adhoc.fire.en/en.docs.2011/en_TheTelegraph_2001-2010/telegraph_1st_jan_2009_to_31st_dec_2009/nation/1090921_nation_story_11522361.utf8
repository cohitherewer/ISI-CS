	New Delhi, Sept. 20: President Pratibha Patils family has asked for a seat for her son in the Maharashtra Assembly elections, queering the pitch for the Congress in the middle of hard bargaining with the NCP.        
	The ticket plea for Rajendra Shekhawat (also known as Raosaheb) has landed the Congress in a dilemma as Sunil Deshmukh, the sitting MLA from Amravati, is seen as an efficient and popular minister. Deshmukh has indicated he will contest as a rebel in case he is denied a nomination.        
	Shekhawat was in the news in April 2008 when he peeled off from the presidential delegation in Mexico City to travel to Florida on a detour from the official itinerary. His brief foray into the US was officially described as for academic purpose.         
	Sources had said the visit was related to negotiations with Florida Atlantic University. The family was then associated with a trust that runs several educational institutions in Maharashtra.        
	At least 10 other Congress leaders are demanding seats for family members. Only five days are left for the last date to file nominations for the October 13 elections.         
	In Haryana, another poll-bound state, the Congress has decided not to entertain requests for relatives other than those who are already MLAs.        
	Union power minister Sushil Kumar Shinde is seeking tickets for daughter Praniti and son-in-law Raj Shroff.         
	Others in the family fray include former chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukhs son Amit, state Congress chief Manikrao Thakres son Rahul, former state party chief Ranjit Deshmukhs son Ashish, state minister Patangrao Kadams son Bishwajit and revenue minister Narayan Ranes son Nitesh. Ranes elder son Nilesh is an MP.        
	Another former party chief Prabha Raus daughter Charulata and Union minister Vilas Muttemwars son Vishal, too, are keen on tickets.        
	The family factor has come into play at a time the Congress and the NCP are burning the midnight oil to sort out seat differences. The two sides still have a few loose ends to sew up.        
	The dispute over 13 seats, five in Pune and eight in Mumbai, kept the leaders busy all of yesterday. The Congress screening committee sat till 2am today to narrow down the differences to barely four-five seats.         
	The Congresss central election committee, which decides candidates, met at Sonia Gandhis residence this morning and finalised 90 names. It met again this evening and cleared a few more names, but the list wasnt made public because a formal announcement of the pact with the NCP was still awaited.         
	Senior leaders believe the announcement will be made tomorrow.

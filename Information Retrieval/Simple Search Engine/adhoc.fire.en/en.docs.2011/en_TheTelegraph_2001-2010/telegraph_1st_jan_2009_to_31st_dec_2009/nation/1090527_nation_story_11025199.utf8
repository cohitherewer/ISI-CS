The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Musical chairs at Pratibhas
                                                                                                               Musical chairs at Pratibhas
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                           Pratibha: Space crunch                                   
	New Delhi, May 26: Only Edwin Lutyens could have helped, but he is not around.         
	So its up to the experienced but short-staffed invitation section of Rashtrapati Bhavan to not let lack of chairs blot the second round of swearing-in at Ashoka Hall on Thursday.         
	The first round, last Friday, saw the leader of the Opposition looking for a chair. While L.K. Advani was quickly provided one, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Amar Singh, who arrived late, too had problems finding seats.        
	It was only after some Congress leaders realised it that the two Samajwadi leaders were provided seats.         
	Rashtrapati Bhavan sources argued that the Samajwadi Party bosses were technically supposed to sit in the sixth row. The two, from the third-largest party in Parliament, finally sat in the third row.         
	Although no word has been received yet by the Presidents house on the probable swearing-in schedule till this evening, preparations are under way to ensure the second round passes without any hiccups.         
	The hall, designed by British architect Lutyens, has a seating capacity of 470 but, on Friday, there were 585 guests to be accommodated. And it was just Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and 19 ministers who took oath on that day.         
	On Thursday, there is a probability that at least 40 ministers would be sworn in.        
	We have that in mind and while about a 100 more people can be accommodated in the hall, the number of guests will be even more than last week. Preliminary arrangements have been done, said a Rashtrapati Bhavan source.        
	Extra chairs have been kept ready, just in case.         
	Although the hall can accommodate 100 media persons, sources said media houses were being requested to limit the number of journalists they would send to cover the event.        
	Every minister taking oath is allowed five guests but Raisina Hill hopes not all of them would bring all their guests.        
	No minister taking oath can be refused his or her guests but many may not get more than three to four guests each, said an official.         
	In addition, there would be at least 200 dignitaries, including former Prime Ministers and Speakers.         
	A Rashtrapati Bhavan old-timer, who joined the former Viceroys House during the tenure of Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed (1974-77), said he had seen swearing-in ceremonies in the lawns earlier. But this security business prevents such open arrangements any more.        
	So its up to the five staffers in the invitation section to make it a smooth affair while sticking to protocol when ushering in the guests.        
	President Pratibha Patil will be watching.

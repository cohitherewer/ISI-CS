The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Single? Rahul says he needs to refocus
                                                                                                               Single? Rahul says he needs to refocus
          JOHN MARY                          Rahul Gandhi at the news conference in Thiruvananthapuram. (PTI)                                  
	Thiruvananthapuram, Oct. 7: Rahul Gandhi may have begun thinking seriously about marriage after all, going by his bashful answers at a news conference here today.        
	The young MP blushed when asked if his single status suited him best in the service of the nation.        
	Yeah, Im very busy these days, he said. I need to refocus myself a bit away from work. Ive been busy.        
	Enough to set off a flutter in many would-be brides hearts. Rahuls reply to a supplementary question too appeared significant.        
	Then, arent you missing the best part of your life?        
	Thats what many people have been telling me these days, the Amethi MP said.        
	Rahul had been spotted with his Spanish friend Veronique in Keralas Kumarakom backwaters on New Years Day in 2004. Veronique is an architect and also my best friend, he had later clarified.        
	The general secretary in charge of the Youth Congress (YC) and party students wing NSUI was on a day-long visit to Kerala campuses. In a check shirt and dark trousers, he looked almost a college student despite being 39.        
	Boisterous crowds greeted him at the four colleges he visited. The fourth, St Teresas College (a girls college) at Kochi, was a late addition to his itinerary.        
	At the news conference, he was asked whether he would accord some weight to the academic credentials of student leaders before entrusting them with organisational responsibilities, especially because courts had criticised the overdose of politics on campuses.        
	Rahul said it was for members of the respective organisations to decide whether ones academic performance or ones achievements in sports needed to be given importance.        
	Asked whether the Supreme Court and the J.M. Lyngdoh Committee were against politicians entering campuses, Rahul almost cautioned himself: Ill be in serious trouble if I have strayed onto the campus in violation of court orders.        
	An aide seated beside him claimed the Lyngdoh Committee had actually encouraged such visits during which a healthy discourse on ideas and ideologies take place on campuses.        
	A buoyed Rahul said the YCs membership had shot to about 2 million  from less than 400,000 earlier  during the recent pre-election membership drive.        
	This (drive) has been just in three states  Punjab, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu  giving us a lot of confidence, he said.        
	He said he did not want to enforce anything from above, even if it meant trying to inject more quality into the YC and the National Students Union of India.        
	If a few years ago it was unclear what Rahul stood for, what his message and his programme were, now there was no such doubt in the MPs mind.        
	He said the Congress would come to power in Uttar Pradesh and I can give you a guarantee on that. Were strengthening the organisation.        
	He said he was still learning, by going out to meet people, sleeping in their tents and talking to chaiwallahs.        
	When will you stop learning?        
	Quickly came the reply: When I die but that doesnt mean theres no action. Action is learning and learning is action. About my visiting Dalits, thats a frame thrust on me by the media. I dont believe in castes. The difference between a poor man and a rich man is a question of opportunities. If you studied in a good university and you are smart and intelligent there are millions out there who are as good but didnt have the opportunity, he said.        
	Asked about Shashi Tharoors tweet that Gandhi Jayanti should be a workday, Rahul said: Its fine with me if the government declares it a working day and or a holiday. Gandhiji should be happy either way.        
	He empathised with Tharoor when a scribe referred to his tweets. You have to understand Tharoorji, because of his job he has to travel a lot.

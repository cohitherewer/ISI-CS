The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitish silences critics, honours mentor George
                                                                                                               Nitish silences critics, honours mentor George
          NALIN VERMA      
	Patna, July 30: In a rare gesture of political magnanimity, Bihar chief minister and state JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar today got his estranged hero and socialist patriarch George Fernandes file nomination papers as a party nominee for the lone Rajya Sabha seat from Bihar.        
	The seat had fallen vacant following its incumbent and JD(U) president Sharad Yadav winning the Madhepura seat in the past Lok Sabha elections. Fernandes is all set to get elected unopposed as no one else has filed papers.        
	The decision to rehabilitate George is believed to be the Bihar chief ministers masterstroke. Nitish Kumar, by fielding George, has silenced many other claimants within the party.        
	Party senior leader, also known as a don, Prabhunath Singh and K.C. Tyagi, an associate of JD(U) national president Sharad Yadav, were also vying for the honour.         
	But by choosing Fernandes, Nitish Kumar has demonstrated his power as the leader of the party and took a step towards forging his old ties with his former guru.         
	The hero of Jaiprakash Narayan-led Bihar movement, Geoege Fernandes, with Nitish Kumar in tow, broke out from Lalu Prasad-led Janata Dal in 1994 and formed Samata Party, becoming its founder president.         
	George played a pivotal role in Nitishs emergence as an alternative to Lalu-Rabri regime in Bihar and as such became the latters mentor in the protracted political battle to replace the 15-year-old regime.        
	However, Nitishs opponents within the party and outside apparently formed a coterie around the now ailing George, estranging the two.        
	The JD(U) denied George a ticket in the past Lok Sabha polls.         
	Egged by Nitishs opponents, George unsuccessfully contested the Lok Sabha poll as a rebel nominee from Muzaffarpur and entered the fray despite the JD(U) offering him the Rajya Sabha seat. The former mentor, however, refused to accept the seat asserting that socialists do not go to Rajya Sabha.        
	However, a visibly emotional Nitish today helped Fernandes file his papers. I have never spoken a word against Georgesaheb and have respected him. I am happy that he has accepted our request to represent the party in the Rajya Sabha, he said.         
	When pointed out that the Magalorian would go to the upper House only for a year as is the seats tenure, the chief minister clarified: Georgesaheb would be in the Rajha Sabha as long as I succeeded in maintaining my political strength.         
	Aiming a barb at his ill-wishers, Nitish said: Eventually, the patriarch has decided to be in the outfit he helped form.         
	Responding to Nitishs call, George landed in Patna night in a special plane.         
	The once firebrand leader was just a shadow of his former self, not in a position to speak or address the media. Nitish was seen guiding the veteran to the presiding officers table and to the lunch table. Sir, khana khane chaliye (Sir, let us go for lunch), Nitish uttered in reverence.        
	Besides silencing his opponents, Nitish Kumar is believed to have succeeded in earning peoples sympathy after honouring the firebrand Mangalorian who won the Muzaffarpur seat from Bihar way back in 1977 for the first time while being in prison. He ruled over Bihars heart for decades.

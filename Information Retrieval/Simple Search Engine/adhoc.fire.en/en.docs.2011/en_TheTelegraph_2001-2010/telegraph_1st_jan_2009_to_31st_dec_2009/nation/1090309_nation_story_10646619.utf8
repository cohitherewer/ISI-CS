The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Interpol DNA request 
                                                                                                               Interpol DNA request 
          NASIR JAFFRY                               
	Islamabad, March 8: The Interpol today asked India to provide DNA samples of the terrorists involved in the Mumbai attacks so it could match them with its own database.        
	We cannot do anything until India provides us the DNA tests, Interpol secretary-general Ronald Noble told a joint news conference with Pakistani interior ministry chief Rehman Malik here.        
	But Noble denied there was any pressure on India to hand over the samples.         
	We cant force anyone to do anything. India has its own national and sovereign interest to quickly get to the bottom of those behind the attack, he said, adding India had to verify its information with the Interpol.        
	Noble, on his second visit to Pakistan in less than three months, said Pakistan had shared with him the outcome of their thorough, complete and exhaustive investigation. This investigation is extraordinary as it is the first time that Interpol has been able to obtain information about those who financed and facilitated the attacks, he said.        
	Noble asked India to answer the 30 questions Pakistan had raised on the Mumbai attacks.

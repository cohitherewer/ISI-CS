          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Hyderabad, March 21: The Congress today denied tickets to three ministers in the Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy cabinet, the trio being among 49 sitting MLAs dumped for next months general and Andhra elections.        
	Ninety new faces, including 29 women, figured in the Assembly list after a week-long exercise that saw differences between chief minister Rajasekhar Reddy and Andhra PCC chief D. Srinivas.        
	The trio who have been eased out are higher education minister M. Hanumantha Rao, marketing minister M. Mareppa and forest minister G. Surya Rao. Deputy Speaker G. Kuthuhalamma, too, did not find a place on the Assembly elections list.        
	Sources said some of the ministers were dumped because they were considered non-performers. Surya Rao and Mareppa were also known for stirring controversies that have landed the Rajasekhar Reddy government in trouble, they said.        
	Two more ministers, K. Rosaiah and Koneru Ranga Rao, are out of the fray. Municipal administration minister Koneru moved aside to give his daughter a chance. Finance minister Rosaiah opted out because of old age, sources said.        
	Rajasekhar Reddy will seek re-election from his home constituency, Pulivendla, in Kadapa district. M. Subramanayam Reddy will contest from Kuppam, the constituency of Telugu Desam chief N. Chandrababu Naidu.        
	Those who have got Lok Sabha tickets include Union minister S. Jaipal Reddy and Rajasekhar Reddys son Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy. They have been given the Chevella and the Kadapa tickets.        
	N.T. Rama Raos daughter and Union minister Daggubati Purandeswari has been fielded from Visakhapatnam as the Bapatla seat she represented in 2004 has been reserved for Scheduled Castes.        
	Union minister Panabaka Lakshmi is being fielded from Bapatla and her husband, P. Krishnaiah, has been given the Assembly ticket from Gudur. Krishnaiah has been working as the chief PRO of South Central Railway.

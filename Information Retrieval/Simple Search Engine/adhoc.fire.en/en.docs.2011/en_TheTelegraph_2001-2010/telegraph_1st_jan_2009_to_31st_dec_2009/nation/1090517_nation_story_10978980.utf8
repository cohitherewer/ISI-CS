	Patna, May 16: As UPAs Jai Ho wave swept across the country, in Bihar it was Nitish Kumars steady development plank that won the day for the NDA. The JD(U)-BJP alliance swept the state polls, decimating Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan-led RJD and LJP combination.        
	The NDA won 32 seats (JD-U 20 and BJP 12) out of the 40 Bihar seats against the eight seats divided among the RJD, LJP, Congress and others. Ram Vilas Paswans LJP drew a blank. Paswan and filmmaker-turned-LJP candidate Prakash Jha were defeated on their Hajipur and West Champaran seats.         
	Congress managed to salvage a part of their clout. The party that fought alone in the state for the first time in 15 years, won two seats as against three that it bagged in the last election and trailed on the second spot on nearly 12 seats, indicating a rise in vote share.        
	Lalu Prasad won the Saran seat against BJPs Rajiv Pratap Rudy, but suffered a drubbing in the hands of his friend-turned-rival, JD(U)s Ranjan Yadav, in Pataliputra. The results established Nitish Kumar as the state hero, while his development plank got the electorates stamp of approval. Even BJP leaders admitted that the Nitish model of development succeeded.         
	Despite contesting in alliance with the BJP, Nitish kept his campaign clinically-free from the Hindutva rhetoric and free of his Gujarat counterpart Narendra Modi while reaching out to a large section of the states minority community with the message of harmony, political justice and economic power.         
	Results also indicate that his social engineering that allowed him to snatch the Extremely Backward Classes (EBCs) from Lalu Prasads Mandal combination succeeded as well, as JD(U)s EBC candidates emerged victorious. As an example, EBC nominee Mangani Lal Mandal wrested away Mithilas Jhanjharpur seat from RJDs Devendra Prasad Yadav.        
	It was JD(U) and BJP all the way from Gopalganj  Lalu Prasads home district  to Mithila in north Bihar. The trend was similar in central and southern parts of Bihar.         
	In central Bihar, BJP star candidate Shatrughan Sinha won the Patna Saheb seat against nearest Congress rival Shekhar Suman by a margin of over 1.27 lakh votes, while state JD(U) chief Lallan Singh won the neighbouring Munger by over 1.5 lakh votes.        
	JD(U) swept central Bihar, too, with candidate Mahabali Singh wresting the Karakat seat from RJDs Kanti Singh and BJPs Lalmuni Choubey retaining Buxar for the sixth consecutive term.         
	The former external affairs minister, Digvijay Singh, who was denied a JD(U) ticket and contested as a rebel candidate from Banka led over his JD(U) rival at the time of the filing of this report.        
	In the Kosi region the JD(U)-BJP combination won as Sharad Yadav (JD-U) wrested the Madhepura seat from RJD leader and don Pappu Yadavs mother Shanti Priya in Supaul while Pappu Yadavs wife Ranjita Ranjan suffered a defeats against in Supaul. Congress retained Sasaram, as Jagjivan Rams daughter Meira Kumar won. The party also bagged the Kishenganj from RJDs Taslimuddin.

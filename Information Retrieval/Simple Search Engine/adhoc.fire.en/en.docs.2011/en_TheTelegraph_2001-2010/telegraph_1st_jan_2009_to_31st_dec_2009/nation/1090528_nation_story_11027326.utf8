          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, May 27: A four-member medical board has found a fathers suspicion that one of his sons kidneys was stolen as baseless.        
	SCB Medical College Hospital superintendent D.N. Maharana, who headed the panel today, said the inquiry had been completed. The findings will be submitted in form of a clinical report to the Cuttack deputy superintendent of police today, said Maharana, refusing to divulge further details.        
	Sources, however, said that 12-year-old Avinash was diagnosed with a case of unilateral renal agenesis  a medical condition in which a person is missing a kidney from birth.        
	A single kidney usually causes no symptoms and is often not discovered at all because the normal kidney compensates and performs the function of two by growing larger than usual, as the child grows.        
	When it is discovered, its usually because the patient is being evaluated for some other problem  appendicitis in the case of Avinash  sources explained.         
	Abhinashs father, Babuli Natha, of Tirtol in Jagatsinghpur, lodged a police complaint believing that his sons kidney was swiped during an appendicitis operation at a private hospital in Cuttack in 2006.        
	The father had told the police that he had recently discovered his sons right kidney was missing after conducting an ultra sound test after his son complained of abdominal pain.         
	However, ultrasound reports done prior to the operation on October 31, 2006, showed two kidneys.         
	Police had launched an investigation and asked the superintendent of SCB Medical College and Hospital for a clinical inquiry into the case.

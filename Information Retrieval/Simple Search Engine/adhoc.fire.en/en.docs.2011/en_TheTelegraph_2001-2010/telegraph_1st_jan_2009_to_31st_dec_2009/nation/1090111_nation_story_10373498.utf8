The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | All eyes on Pak, and little else
                                                                                                               All eyes on Pak, and little else
          OUR BUREAU                           Menon: Neighbour trouble                                   
	New Delhi, Jan. 10: The good-hearted grunt, and the guffaw that followed, was almost symptomatic of South Blocks Pakistan-centric preoccupations at the moment. At the fag end of the long news conference that foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon took on January 5 over the handing over of the Mumbai terror evidence to Islamabad, came a hesitant question from the back benches.        
	It was an entirely fair, even urgent, one to have been raised  it was on how India saw the unfolding war in northern Sri Lanka.        
	But 26/11 has so relegated the rest of the subcontinent in the mind-scope of the foreign office that its senior-most functionary actually burst out laughing before he settled down to respond.        
	Are the Pakistan files stacked so high and heavy they are pressing out the rest of the neighbourhood from New Delhis priority list?        
	It isnt as if the subcontinent is in stasis. On the contrary, the last fortnight has been a rush of events  some momentous  all around.        
	A quiet and defiant Maoist consolidation in Nepal, whose latest manifestation was the ouster of Indian priests who have for centuries been custodians of Kathmandus vaunted Pashupatinath temple (an order that has now been revoked);        
	A historic sweep by Sheikh Hasina Wajeds Awami League in Bangladesh, which raises the prospect of an easing on the eastern front but which will require fresh and deft effort on Indias part; and        
	The lightning northwards surge of the Sri Lankan army, smashing LTTE strongholds on its way to what could become a fight to the finish.        
	 But Pakistan has so wholesomely hogged attention in recent weeks that it has almost appeared as if New Delhi is non-cognisant of other events pleading attention.        
	It is not the case and cannot be that India is not aware of or is not reacting to what is happening elsewhere, says a senior foreign office bureaucrat. We have, after all, a huge and organised system of desks here and missions abroad that cannot and do not take their eye off their core area. What may be happening, though, is that the Pakistan business is obliterating everything else. That is true of how the media is projecting things as well, not just the external affairs ministry.        
	A retired diplomat who would not be named even justified the current accent on Pakistan. Mumbai was a catastrophic event with no parallels to what is happening elsewhere in the region. What do you expect other than for our focus to be totally on Pakistan?        
	Former foreign secretary Salman Haider agreed and disagreed. We are in the middle of a major crisis with Pakistan, other things will inevitably get thrust into the background. So I do not put what is happening as a black mark against the government.        
	But he added: It will be a disappointment if the full impact and implications of the events around us, especially in Sri Lanka, are not taken in.        
	By far the most critical foreign policy challenge is emerging in Sri Lanka, where the army offensive against the LTTE has not only created the prospect of a Tamil refugee influx into India but also threatens to unsettle the political equilibrium within Tamil Nadu.        
	Foreign secretary Menon only restated a known position when he said, guffawing: Our position is quite clear that there are several aspects to the Sri Lankan problem and that no one of them is sufficient to solve the problem. There is no military solution to this problem. There is a political aspect which needs work because until there is a political understanding within the framework of a united Sri Lanka, within which all the communities in Sri Lanka are comfortable, you cannot speak of a political solution of the situation in Sri Lanka.        
	Thereafter, he quickly turned to more questions on Pakistan.

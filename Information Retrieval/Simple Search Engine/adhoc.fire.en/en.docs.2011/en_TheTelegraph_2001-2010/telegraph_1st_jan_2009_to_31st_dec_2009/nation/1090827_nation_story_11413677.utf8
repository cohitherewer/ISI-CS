The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bias finger   at Rajnath
                                                                                                               Bias finger   at Rajnath
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Advani (top), Khanduri                                      
	New Delhi, Aug. 26: The BJP leadership is treading with caution on Arun Shourie but some within the party are unhappy with what they see as different yardsticks for different leaders.        
	Ousted Uttarakhand chief minister B.C. Khanduri has questioned the wisdom of hauling up only state leaders for the partys poor performance in the last elections.         
	Khanduris move to question his ouster has come at a time the party is grappling with problems created by Shourie and former Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje. Though central leaders hope Raje will resign as leader of Opposition in the Assembly, Khanduris move, they fear, will boost her confidence.         
	Sources said Khanduri did write to BJP chief Rajnath Singh detailing the reasons for the partys defeat in the general election in his state, but the letter didnt have any adverse remarks about central leaders.        
	Reports from Dehra Dun suggested that Khanduri felt he was made a scapegoat whereas no critical analysis had been done of the roles played by the central leaders during the elections.        
	Khanduri, ousted mainly because of dissidence, holds Rajnath responsible for the action against him. The sources said Khanduri, who had the blessings of L.K. Advani, would be emboldened to revolt if Raje manages to stay on, deepening the fault-lines within the party.        
	Against this backdrop, a section of the party favours swift action against Shourie to pre-empt more protests. But Rajnath and a few other senior leaders are not inclined to take strong action against him.        
	The RSS, too, thinks Shouries attack on the party brass was not driven by personal interests but aimed at cleaning up the system.

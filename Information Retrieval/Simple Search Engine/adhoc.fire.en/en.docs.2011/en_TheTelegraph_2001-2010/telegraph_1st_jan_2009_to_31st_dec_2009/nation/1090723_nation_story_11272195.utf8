The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Eclipse of superstition, sunrise of a new attraction for science   Fear in 1980, feast in 2009
                                                                                                               Eclipse of superstition, sunrise of a new attraction for science   Fear in 1980, feast in 2009
          G.S. MUDUR                                                  
	New Delhi, July 22: Indians watched the total solar eclipse today from school rooftops, parks patronised by morning walkers, camps pitched by local science clubs, and from Indias first-ever chartered flight into an eclipse belt.        
	The turnout may be a signal of long-awaited change.        
	Delhi resident Valsan Cherian recalls another era. It was February 16, 1980, a total solar eclipse was scheduled to pass over India around 3.40pm, about the time he had to catch the Frontier Mail train from Kota to Delhi.         
	The Kota platform had a deserted look, and he had only one co-passenger in his train compartment. As the train rolled out of the station, his co-passenger told him: Sit away from the window... the sun might hurt you.        
	The change evident in the turnout of eclipse watchers today comes after several years of campaigns waged by government agencies, astronomy clubs and even rural science popularlisation efforts.        
	The turnout suggests that fears of eclipses are receding, said Vinay Kamble, director of Vigyan Prasar, an agency set up by Indias Department of Science and Technology to popularise science and technology and promote scientific temper across the country.        
	Thousands of people congregated today in towns along the path of the eclipse  Indore, Bhopal, Varanasi, Patna and Dibrugarh  to take a chance with the clouds.         
	Dozens of children  and some parents  waited at dawn on the fourth floor rooftop of a school in Uttar Pradesh for a glimpse of a partially eclipsed sun.        
	In Bangalores Lal Bagh, a popular park, several hundred morning walkers gathered at a site prepared by the Indian Institute of Astrophysics for a breakfast of kharabhaat, kesaribhaat and tea. It was an overcast sky, but this was an attempt to dispel concerns about eating during eclipses, said Harish Bhat, dean of the Institute.                    A schoolgirl in Delhi views the eclipse.

	Were now witnessing a commercialisation of popular astronomy which in its own way may help promote science, said the agency official.        
	All the 42 window seats on a chartered Boeing 737-700 were taken by eclipse enthusiasts, said Thomas Thottathil, a spokesperson for the travel agency that organised the flight. We had another 30 people on board who also got a glimpse of the eclipse, he said.         
	The plane took off from Delhi at 4.40am, headed south and east and turned northwards, to give passengers a view of the eclipse on their right from 40,000ft, he said.         
	There were so many superstitions about solar eclipses that weve tried to demolish, Kamble said. People had baseless fears  that you cant eat during an eclipse, that the sun emits dangerous rays, or that pregnant women exposed to an eclipse will have babies with congenital defects, he said.        
	Some astronomers believe the change in attitudes was visible in 1995 when a total solar eclipse in Rajasthan attracted tourists from across India.         
	Astronomy helps attract people to science, said Kamble. In 2004, nearly a 1,000 people in a village in Madhya Pradesh queued up to use a single set of filters to watch the planet Venus transit across the face of the sun, he said.        
	In the weeks ahead of the eclipse, Vigyan Prasar used the radio to draw people to the event. A special programme on the total solar eclipse was broadcast by the All India Radio on July 5, 12, and 19.        
	In May and June, the agency had conducted workshops for schoolteachers in several states to help prepare them to inspire children to watch the eclipse. It engaged with non-government science clubs in rural areas.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitish flays Centre
                                                                                                               Nitish flays Centre
                            
	New Delhi, May 31 (PTI): Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar today attacked the Centre saying that his state was yet to receive funds for rehabilitation of Kosi flood victims.        
	Nitish said he had written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, his second, a week ago, making seven demands, including special rehabilitation package for Kosi victims and special status for Bihar. He dismissed statements against the Bihar JD(U) leader that alleged that he was yet to send a proposal to the Centre for rehabilitation. He said: A detailed proposal was sent in October last year.        
	The chief minister also flayed the Centre for twisting facts to deny money for relief and rehabilitation. In April 2009, we received a letter from the Centre that said it found that we already had surplus money in our calamity relief account and hence we owed only Rs 500 crore to the Centre. So, the rest of the over Rs 1,000 crore, to be given to us for relief work, should be returned, he said.        
	The Centre had granted over Rs 1,000 crore to the Bihar government for relief.         
	Later, the state government had demanded a separate package of Rs 14,800 crore for rehabilitation of the flood victims.         
	Nitish added that the Prime Minister had called him up the previous month when the former had rubbished claims that the state was sitting on surplus funds. Manmohan Singh had later called Nitish and assured that he would look into the matter.        
	We are still waiting for the results of that probe. We are ready to answer their every question. Officers of the Bihar government had in fact visited the national capital a number of times in this regard, he added.        
	He, however, parried a question on whether this was happening because he heads a government of the opposition alliance in the state.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Under glare, Pak restricts Hafiz to home
                                                                                                               Under glare, Pak restricts Hafiz to home
                              Hafiz Saeed                            
	Lahore, Sept. 21: Pakistan restricted the movements of alleged Mumbai attacks mastermind Hafiz Mohammed Saeed early this morning, preventing him from leaving his home to lead Id prayers, but authorities shied away from using the expression house arrest.        
	The move comes days before the foreign secretaries and foreign ministers of India and Pakistan meet in New York, and at a time the US has renewed pressure on Islamabad to act against militants.        
	We have verbal orders to restrict his movement. We have asked him not to leave his house, said senior Lahore police officer Sohail Sukhera.        
	Saeed, chief of the Jamaat-ud-Dawa  a front for militant group Lashkar-e-Toiba  had been put under house arrest last November, shortly after the Mumbai attacks. But a Pakistani court released him in June, saying the government had never presented any evidence against him.        
	Lahore police chief Chaudhry Muhammad Shafiq said several officers had been posted at Saeeds home in the citys Johar neighbourhood.        
	Sukhera, however, denied TV reports that Saeed was under house arrest and declined to say how long Saeed would be confined to his home.        
	Although Delhi wants Saeed prosecuted for the Mumbai attacks, Islamabad has not linked its latest move to the 26/11 siege, perhaps keeping in mind hard-liners charge that it was kowtowing to the US and India.        
	Officers said Saeed was being confined in connection with his recent hate speeches, for which two cases were lodged against him in Faisalabad on Friday.        
	Pakistan will try to persuade India to restart the peace process, stalled since the Mumbai attacks, when its foreign minister meets his Indian counterpart on September 27 on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, a day after talks between the two foreign secretaries.        
	Indian foreign minister S.M. Krishna has, however, pointed out that the latest cases against Saeed make no mention of the Mumbai attacks and said: We wont be satisfied till Pakistan takes action against Hafiz Saeed.        
	Saeed has never been prosecuted in Pakistan, though. Delhi claims to have provided substantial evidence against him in dossiers handed to Islamabad. But yesterday, Pakistan interior minister Rehman Malik said the evidence was sketchy and would not stand in a court of law.        
	Saeeds spokesman Yahya Mujahid said: There are no written orders but he is not allowed to go out of his home. He has been barred from performing his religious duty, it is against basic human rights.        
	Mujahid said Saeeds son led the Id prayers and added that the curbs on Saeed would be challenged in court. He accused the government of capitulating to the US and India.        
	Perhaps to assuage such sentiments, officer Sukhera claimed Saeeds movements had been restricted because of concerns for his security.        
	We have only stopped Saeed from offering Id prayers at a ground near the Gaddafi Stadium to ensure the safety of him and his people. We have intelligence information and that is why we cannot allow him to move freely.

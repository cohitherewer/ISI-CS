The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | HC restricts nun case proceedings
                                                                                                               HC restricts nun case proceedings
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, April 17: Orissa High Court has imposed restrictions on the alleged nun gangrape case proceedings in the court of the sub divisional judicial magistrate at Baliguda in Kandhamal.        
	Recording of the victim nuns statements in the court was part of the proceedings, which was scheduled for April 20, 21 and 22.        
	The high court, however, has ordered for deferring of the proceedings for an indefinite period. The bench of Justice B.K. Patel issued the interim order on a petition filed by the victim nun yesterday.        
	While seeking shifting of the case proceedings out of the court at Baluguda, the petition has expressed apprehensions of threat to her life in Kandhamal.        
	The petition has invoked the inherent powers of the high court under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The state counsel submitted before the court that the government was prepared to give all security to the nun to appear before the court at Baliguda for recording her statement. No untoward incident has been reported from the area since October last year, the state counsel added.        
	The victim nuns counsel, June Choudhury, on the other hand, raised questions on the appropriateness of scheduling the court proceedings for April 20, 21 and 22. Choudhury further said there was reasonable chance of danger to her life if she went to the Baliguda court for recording her statement.        
	Taking note of it Justice Patel cancelled the dates fixed for recording her statements in the court. The proceedings would remain deferred indefinitely until disposal of the petition, the high court said in its order, while issuing notices to the state government to file an affidavit clarifying its stand on the question of shifting the nun gangrape case proceedings out of the court in Kandhamal.        
	Earlier, the high court had allowed a petition filed by the nun, seeking a TI parade venue shift from Baliguda to any other place. Consequently, the TI parade was held at Choudwar jail.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 22: Pranab Mukherjee today said he wouldnt rule out the possibility of the Congress taking Left help to form a government in case of a hung Parliament.        
	I am not ruling out the possibility. But there would be no such need as we are optimistic about getting a decisive mandate he said.        
	Asked if his comment went against the deal with Trinamul, the Congress veteran said: I myself had worked out the alliance with Mamata Banerjee but did not accept any condition like this (not taking Left help).        
	Mukherjee blamed his broken Hindi for yesterdays misunderstanding with Lalu Prasad after he was quoted as saying that the RJD chief will not be part of the next government. Lalu Prasad, he added, had advised him to henceforth speak in English.

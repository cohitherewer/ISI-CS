          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 12: Members of Orissa Medical Service Association, representing 2,500-odd government doctors, today threatened to quit their jobs on December 18, if the state did not fulfil their demands for cadre restructuring.        
	We will be forced to cease work from December 18, if the government does not implement the assurances by December 16 evening, association president Madhusudan Mishra said this afternoon.         
	Mishra said government doctors had submitted resignations last year but postponed their decision thrice considering peoples plight. But peeved over the inordinate delay in implementation of the government assurance, the associations general body has fixed a deadline of December 18.        
	The state health secretary had called the association for negotiations yesterday.         
	But no time frame was given by the government for implementing the decision. So, we are giving the final ultimatum to implement the decision by December 16, Mishra said.        
	Deploring the poor service and working condition of government doctors serving in rural health institutions of the state, Mishra said nearly 6,000 out of 8,400 medical graduates passing out from the medical colleges of Orissa in 28 years had left the state or were serving in the private sector. For government doctors serving for more than 25 years would retire without any promotion, Mishra said.

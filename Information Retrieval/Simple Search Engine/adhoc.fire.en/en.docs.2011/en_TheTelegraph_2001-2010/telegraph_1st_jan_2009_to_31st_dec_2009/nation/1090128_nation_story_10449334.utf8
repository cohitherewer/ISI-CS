The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | India to Japan: Buy equipment for IIT
                                                                                                               India to Japan: Buy equipment for IIT
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 27: India has insisted that Japan buy state-of-the-art equipment for the new Indian Institute of Technology in Hyderabad to compensate for backing out of financial commitments to the institute which it had promised to jointly set up.         
	Japan will be expected to provide modern scientific and technical equipment for laboratories at the IIT under an agreement the two countries arrived at last week, top government officials said.         
	Indian officials are calling the agreement final, suggesting that any move by Japan to deviate from the new terms could mean cracks in the collaboration on IIT Hyderabad.         
	Japan is yet to formally commit to the terms of the collaboration that emerged from discussions between its officials and the HRD ministry on Thursday.         
	But its response will be crucial in shaping Indias future approach towards funding from foreign governments for its new wave of institution-building for higher education.         
	France has offered assistance in setting up IIT Rajasthan, which started classes from IIT Kanpur in 2008.         
	But India  bitter from what officials perceive as Japans lack of commitment  is unsure about depending on French help. The response will also be critical because the collaboration over the IIT was cited by the two countries as a major sign of their friendship during Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs visit to Japan in October 2008.         
	The Prime Ministers Office has since taken a keen interest in the collaboration, and is scheduled to discuss the new agreement with HRD officials this week, sources said.         
	Indian officials claim Japan had indicated it would share the burden of starting IIT Hyderabad in every way, including financially, when it agreed to assist the institute in April 2008.         
	But discussions between the two sides during Singhs Tokyo trip were inconclusive, with Japan refusing to commit to financial support. Instead, Japan limited its assistance to offering intellectual support  tie-ups with top companies and access to its research facilities for the IIT students.         
	It, however, insists that the memorandum of understanding refer to the project as a shared venture.         
	Tokyo has asked for the institute to offer courses in Japanese language and management techniques. The proposals, if accepted, would make IIT Hyderabad the first of the premier engineering schools with a tilt towards education from a particular foreign country.

	New Delhi, Jan. 1 (PTI): India today said the US has given Pakistan strong evidence about involvement of Lashkar-e-Toiba in the Mumbai attacks and that Islamabad should now hand over the culprits for which no extradition treaty is required.        
	Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee said Pakistan is yet to demonstrate tangible action against the perpetrators though it is obliged to do so under international laws. We have been told that there is some strong evidence available with FBI and they have shared it with Pakistan. We expect that Pakistan will act on them and hand over the perpetrators of terror attack in Mumbai to us, he told a TV channel.

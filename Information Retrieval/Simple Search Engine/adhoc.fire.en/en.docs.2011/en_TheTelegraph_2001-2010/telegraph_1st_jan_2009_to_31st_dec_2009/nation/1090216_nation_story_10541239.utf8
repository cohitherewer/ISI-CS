                                                                                                               109 held in two states for rail test paper leak 
                            
	Jaipur/Lucknow, Feb. 15 (PTI): Over 100 people were arrested today as police of three states jointly busted a Railway Recruitment Board paper leak racket whose alleged mastermind is a former ticket examiner.        
	A total of 109 people were arrested  105 in Jaipur and four in Bhopal.        
	A railway board written test for the post of assistant stationmaster to be held in Ajmer today was put off. A new date would be announced later, board chairman C.L. Bharti said.        
	Although the arrests were made in Jaipur and Bhopal, the police in the two states worked on a tip-off from Uttar Pradesh police.        
	Raids were carried out in Jaipur and Bhopal. While 105 people, including 11 gang members and 94 candidates, were arrested in Jaipur, four operators were nabbed in Bhopal, Brij Lal, the additional director-general of police (law and order), said in Lucknow. He added that copies of question papers for the Ajmer examination were found in both the places.        
	Lal said: Bediram, who was a travelling ticket examiner with North-Eastern railway, is the mastermind. Last December, he was arrested in Allahabad by the special task force, which busted a similar racket there, but was released on bail recently.        
	The railways sacked Bediram after his arrest.        
	Lal said Uttar Pradesh police had been tracking the gang members since last December. Through electronic surveillance we came to know that they have leaked the question paper of an examination being conducted by the RRB in Ajmer today, he said.        
	In Jaipur, Kapil Garg, an additional director-general of police, said the gang used to charge Rs 4 lakh from each candidate. Of 94 candidates arrested, 82 were from Bihar.

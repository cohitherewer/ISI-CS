                                                                                                               After military, market marches in
										      SANKARSHAN THAKUR      BACK TO FRONT
  10 YEARS OF KARGIL 4                            The refurbished Hotel Siachen in Kargil; (above) Tiger Hill as seen from Drass                           
	Every day the face of Drass changes. Every day it gets more smashed and scarred, and every day it acquires a more menaced countenance. The mud and timber structures of this one lively hamlet burn and crumble one after the other under merciless fire from the hilltops. And more and more soldiers eddy on its blistered heart. They will probably have to alter the way Drass has been described hitherto. It is advertised as the second coldest inhabited place on earth. Cold it is, whipped by icy winds even in mid-June, but it has no inhabitants anymore.          
	From a report in The Telegraph, June 1999               
	You can now buy a 32GB pen drive in Drasss one-lane bazaar and, should you so wish, a laptop to attach it to as well. A two-storey, 20-room hotel stands where there used to be nothing but shelled rock, there are any number of eateries vending a varied fare from kachauris to kebabs, and a music shop where Saif Ali Khan and Deepika Padukone have just arrived, cut out life-size in cardboard, peddling Love Aaj Kal  Chor Bazaari is the rage of the Drass market.         
	The armed forces werent the only sector that got upgraded as mandatory corrections for the lapses of 1998-99 in the Kargil sector; along came a quantum churn in the tertiary sector  construction, labour, transport, supplies and, in no mean measure, war tourism.         
	Its perhaps a terrible thing to say, but the war of 1999 became a huge boon for the Kargil region, says Mohammed Sadiq, owner of Hotel Siachen, which was home to the media through the course of the 1999 engagement.         
	Who knew Kargil before that? Only truck drivers and travellers between Leh and Srinagar for whom Kargil was a necessary night halt. Not so now. Kargil is a place in its own right, through the summer my rooms are booked by people who come to see where the battles of 1999 were fought, everybody knows Kargil now, from here to Kanyakumari.         
	Hotel Siachen was a stinky dump that offered flea-infested beds, a half-bucket of tepid bathing water at three hours notice and no food.         
	But most of us were still grateful it was there because there was no place else to stay in Kargil during the war.         
	But Sadiq has turned all past inefficiencies around, if only to keep up with the competition cropping up all over town. He has put in a central boiler system, carpeted and curtained the rooms, installed cable television and, treat of treats, opened a 24-hour kitchen. I had to do it, just had to, because there are many other hotels now, he says. We serve Kashmiri, Indian, Continental, Chinese, Buddhist, everything.         
	Buddhist? Well, that mustve been Sadiqs way of saying Ladakhi. Yak meat? Probably no, but if you have more commonplace preferences like stewed salmon and camembert or penne and parmesan, you can always duck into one of the many little high-street superstores that have sprung out of what used to be holes in the wall.         
	Army ne paisa lagaya, logon ne paisa banaya (The army put in money, the people made good of it), is how Jaffers earthy lucidity explained the economic transformation of the war zone.         
	Major domo of Hotel Siachen back then, Jaffer himself has been one of the beneficiaries of post-war investments; he was always a bit of a loveable rascal, purloining money off every meal or drink that he secured us off his deep contacts, and hes evidently graduated to higher methods.         
	Jaffer wouldnt reveal how hed made his money over the past decade  defence contracts and illicit booze, if you believed the small-town grapevine  but he has his eyes set on a modest hotel of his own now. Kuch to karna hai paise se, umar bhi ho rahi hai (I have to do something with the money, Im getting on too).         
	Enquiries about another character from the war  cab driver Ishaq Khan who braved many perilous trips closer up to the front with us, this way and that from Kargil in his beat-up Willys Jeep  revealed that he too had progressed upwards. Ishaq, old friends at the Kargil taxi stand said, had become a labour contractor with the army in Batalik and also farmed apricots on the side.         
	But new prosperity has travelled far beyond the unlikely broadway bustle of Kargil. In the Suroo valley, where most of the Drass-Kargil population had sought shelter in the summer of 1999, the establishment of a new defence brigade (in addition to the vast new brigade at Drass itself) and a hydro-power project has led to a rash of pucca construction.         
	In Mushkoh, which lay desolate and depeopled by severe shelling during the war, theres a new mushrooming of satellite dishes on low mud rooftops. As we drove through what used to be a devastated battleground, Neelesh Misra, who was AP reporter back then and a trusty wartime mate, remarked: Market forces have arrived, what more do you want?         
	Owing to its remoteness, Mushkoh is still the laggard in the Kargil sector, but even there the evidence of recent bounty lies liberally sprinkled  a magnificent new mosque, a striking outcrop of concrete houses, well-supplied wayside stores, even a metalled road that runs beyond the last field positions the army had created during the war. All it awaits now is an arrow directing tourists to the next tea-stop on their war tour.

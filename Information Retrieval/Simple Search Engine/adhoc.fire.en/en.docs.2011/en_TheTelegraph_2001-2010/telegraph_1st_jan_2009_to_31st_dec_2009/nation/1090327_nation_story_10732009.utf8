The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP friends: People like you
                                                                                                               BJP friends: People like you
          SANJAY K. JHA                          Jaitley at the meeting in Delhi. (PTI                                  
	New Delhi, March 26: The Friends of the BJP, a forum of high-flying businessmen and professionals, is trying to create a new urban voter who ultimately becomes the voice of India, knocking the aam aadmi off his poll perch.        
	This voter will be animated by a passion for economic growth, stronger reforms, national security and good governance.        
	Instead of the common man, the Friends use the term people like you to refer to bankers, technocrats, doctors, venture capitalists and the like, who are mobilised through the Internet and text messages and who work out strategies in air-conditioned rooms. The Friends hope their silent movement, born in Mumbai 50 days ago, will become the harbinger of change.        
	After impressive functions in Mumbai and Bangalore, they came to Delhi today to try and drive the message home that the BJP was a cleaner, more democratic and less feudal option. They were determined to ensure at least 175 seats for the party.        
	The Friends speak of Advanis leadership, use symbols like the Taj in flames, the Pokhran tests and the Kargil war, and pray for world-class infrastructure in India. They also want the BJP back for greater allocations in education and agriculture, oblivious that the UPAs record is far better on these fronts.        
	These committed individuals flew from Mumbai and Bangalore to attend the function, which was addressed by the suave Arun Jaitley and attended by people like them, such as Ravi Shankar Prasad, Pratibha Advani and Vijay Jolly.        
	They giggled and clapped when Jaitley asked if the road project launched by the BJP was not secular. They were ecstatic when Jaitley ripped into Manmohan Singh, once the Indian elites darling.        
	Jaitley tickled the Friends by making the IPL his central theme. He said shifting the tournament amounted to a confession by the government about what it had done to Indias security.        
	This will affect other sports too in addition to investments and tourism. Will they now shift the Kumbh Mela, Ajmer Sharif and other places where crowds assemble?        
	Jaitley said the poll scene had changed dramatically in the past 15 days. In Bihar, UP and Jharkhand, the Congress has allies but no alliance. In West Bengal and Maharashtra, the Congress has alliances but the allies are not dependable. In Tamil Nadu, there is an ally and an alliance but completely unproductive as they cannot win seats.        
	A roar of laughter followed, indicating the BJP might be winning the war at least in cyberspace and auditoriums.

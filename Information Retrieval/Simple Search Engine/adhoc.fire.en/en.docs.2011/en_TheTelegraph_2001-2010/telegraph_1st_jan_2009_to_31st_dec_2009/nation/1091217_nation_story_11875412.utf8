	Raipur, Dec. 16: Orphaned in Maoist violence, children from red zone of Chhattisgarh are out to see the world that is not dotted with landmines or ruled by bullets.        
	Fifty children who lost their parents during rebel massacres over the years are on a trip to Delhi from the dense forests of insurgency-hit Dantewada district. They will visit the national capital to see historical monuments besides meeting President Pratibha Patil. Kumari Rukmani of Kisteram and studying in Class VI is keen to meet the President. I will request the President to eliminate the Maoists, who killed my father in 2006, she said.        
	Interestingly, its not any civil rights or non-government organisation arranging the trip, but the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), which is combating the rebels in their den, which has organised the trip under its civic action programme.         
	The students will stay in New Delhi for a week and will see the monuments to know the countrys history, besides meeting prominent persons, including the President, CRPF deputy inspector-general S.C. Parashar said.         
	The students left for the national capital by train last evening.        
	The students stay at the state-run residential Astha Gurukul School in the worst Maoist-hit district of Dantewada in restive south Bastar. The total number of students in the school is 150.         
	The CRPF plans to arrange the trip in batches. Of the students, 20 are girls. Three teachers and an escort of CRPF are accompanying them to Delhi.         
	The students are orphans, underprivileged and have not seen the world outside, Parashar said.         
	Having witnessed ugly violence unleashed by the Maoists and living under death threats, the children were awe-struck seeing the chaos in the city roads for the first time yesterday.         
	Even the children  fear and pain of losing parents still etched on the faces  saw a train for the first time.        
	Now, they want no more children to be deprived of parenthood by the Maoists. We want the end of Maoist menace, said Karam Ram, who is studying in Class V.         
	Hailing from Konta area, Ram  whose sister is in Class III in the same school  recalls how the rebels organised a meeting in the village in February 2006 and killed his father.

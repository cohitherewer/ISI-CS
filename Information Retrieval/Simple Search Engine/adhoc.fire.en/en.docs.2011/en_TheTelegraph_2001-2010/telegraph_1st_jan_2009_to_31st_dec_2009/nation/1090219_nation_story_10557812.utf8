          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Feb. 18: In a pre-poll breather to Lalu Prasads RJD, Patna High Court today granted party MP and don Rajesh Ranjan, alias Pappu Yadav, bail in connection with the Ajit Sarkar murder case.         
	The CBI special court here had convicted Pappu for life in Tihar Jail on February 29, 2008, for the murder of Purnea CPM MLA and labour leader Ajit Sarkar. Sarkar was killed in 1998 and Pappu has been behind bars for his involvement for the past eight years.         
	The so-called don, who rules north Bihars Kosi region with his clout, challenged the special courts verdict in the high court in June 2008, pleading for bail. But, the court kept his criminal appeal pending and refused his request, ruling that he could make his bail prayer after a gap of six months.         
	Today, the jailed MP was granted bail by a division bench of Shivkirti Singh and Abhijit Sinha after his lawyer, Ajit Ojha, reminded the court about the six month deadline and made the last prayer for bail.         
	The bench, however, has kept Pappus bail appeal pending, virtually barring him from contesting the polls. Today Ojha said the free MP would now move court for keeping his conviction under suspension till the special court gives its verdict on it. If the court keeps his conviction under suspension, Pappu Yadav will be eligible for the poll, the lawyer said.         
	In any case, a free Pappu Yadav spells big relief for the UPA. His wife, Ranjita Ranjan, is an MP from Saharsa and is sure to contest the Lok Sabha polls. Pappu will be in a position to campaign for his wife and his party in the polls.         
	Pappu Yadav had won the Madhepura Lok Sabha seat in a by-election after the RJD boss retained Chapra, vacating Madhepura. Lalu Prasad had won Madhepura, besides Chapra, defeating JD(U)s Sharad Yadav.         
	The news of Pappus release must have caused anxious moments to Sharad Yadav who is set to contest the Madhepura seat as the JD(U) nominee.         
	Pappu will be at his seat with all his might and clout to push the veteran to the wall.

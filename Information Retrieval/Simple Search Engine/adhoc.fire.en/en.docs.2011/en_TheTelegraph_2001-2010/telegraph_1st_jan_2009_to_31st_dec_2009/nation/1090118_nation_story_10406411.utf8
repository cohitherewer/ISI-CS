The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | MP gets boot for Modi praise
                                                                                                               MP gets boot for Modi praise
          JOHN MARY                              
	Thiruvananthapuram, Jan. 17: The CPM today suspended A.P. Abdulla Kutty from the party for a year for praising Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modis development initiatives.        
	Kutty, a two-time MP from Kannur in north Malabar, said he was shocked and pained by the decision but was not in the right frame of mind to talk about his political future.        
	Kutty, who has had a two-decade-long association with the CPM, said his comments had been misinterpreted.         
	Id deliberately used his (Modi) name to invite attention to development issues in Kerala. If I were to mention Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit and her winning streak because of development, nobody would have even pretended to see it.        
	The CPM, however, left the disciplinary action to the Mayyil area committee, of which Kutty was a member. It did not want to expel him straightaway and give him a chance to play martyr.        
	Kutty had patted Modi at an India Media Forum meeting in Dubai on December 28, saying Gujarat was Indias most investor-friendly state.        
	When Ratan Tata pulled out the Nano car project from Singur, it was Gujarat that came up with the most attractive offer. Other states, including Kerala, should emulate the Gujarat model.        
	I am saying this while maintaining my criticism of Modi as a communal fascist.

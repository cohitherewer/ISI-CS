The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ghost of Jinnah hits BJP recruitment
                                                                                                               Ghost of Jinnah hits BJP recruitment
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          BJP chief Rajnath Singh at a party meeting in Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 8: The recent crises in the BJP have hit its membership campaign, with prospective recruits and even old-time members asking uncomfortable questions.        
	Leaders, officials and activists engaged in the recruitment and renewal drive say that for the first time, they have to convince people why they should join the BJP.        
	I was asked, Does the party have a future? What does a person gain from joining it? a Lok Sabha MP from eastern Uttar Pradesh said. They say that if the BJP doesnt come to power at the Centre and keeps losing states, (it cant) dole out contracts and government jobs.        
	In Madhya Pradesh, where the BJP is in power, its perceived lack of ideological commitment has dismayed the older members and provoked cynicism among fence-sitters.        
	An MP from the state said: For the first time, our senior members are quizzing me about the core issues. One standard question has been, Have you given up on the Ram temple? When I say we will build it when we come to power in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, they chuckle.        
	The supplementary is, But what were you doing when you had governments in Delhi and Lucknow? My answer is, we are committed to a judicial resolution or an out-of-court settlement with the Hindu and Muslim litigants. They laugh and say, Maybe you should ask Jinnahs ghost to come and settle it.        
	In Rajasthan, officials were asked to repeat the BJPs cardinal principles (integral humanism, nationalism, positive secularism, etc.) before prospective recruits accepted the membership forms. It was like a general knowledge test, a source said.        
	In Bihar too there is no marked enthusiasm to join the BJP, although the party is in a coalition government with the Janata Dal (United), sources said.        
	There was a time when, regardless of whether we were in power anywhere, people joined the BJP. Power has changed the situation, a Bihar BJP functionary rued.        
	The RSS, in its renewed supervisory role, has not made things any easier. Vice-president Bal Apte, who is looking after the organisational polls, said the Sangh had directed him to appoint observers in every ward, panchayat, district and state to do away with fake members. Apte said that if the membership fell in the bargain, so be it.        
	In Delhi, where the BJP has been out of power for 12 years, membership is down from a few lakhs (nobody gave the exact figure) to 79,255. Nobody is sure if it will touch 50,000 this time.        
	Every member has a six-year term. Since the organisational polls started on July 16, only 50 people have renewed their membership in Delhi and till now, theres not been a single new name.        
	The party now has 2.14 crore members. The only state where it hopes to gain is Gujarat, where it has the largest number of members: 33 lakh. Narendra Modi has activated the organisational apparatus to prove a point to the Sangh.

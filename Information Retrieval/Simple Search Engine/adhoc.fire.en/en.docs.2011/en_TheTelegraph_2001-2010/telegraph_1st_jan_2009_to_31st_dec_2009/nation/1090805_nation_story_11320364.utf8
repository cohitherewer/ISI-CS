The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Salary row, teachers absent
                                                                                                               Salary row, teachers absent
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 4: Parents and teachers of several English-medium schools in the city are once again at loggerheads over boycotting of classes by the latter protesting non-payment of salaries for the past five months.        
	For the past few weeks, teachers of about five public schools have been sporting black badges and not attending classes. The school management has no money to give us since there has been no collection of fee, said Pushpa Manjari Das, a schoolteacher.        
	Staging protest outside DAV Charashekharpur, the parents today saw the problem as a well-planned idea to put pressure on the state government to enhance fee structure as was proposed by various schools recently.        
	The teachers flatly refused to teach and students could be spotted idly spending time in classrooms. For the past five months, we have been working without salary. Its enough now, said another teacher at the school requesting anonymity.        
	Some students, who are enjoying holidays, have also joined the protest and many of them in fact support their teachers as their demands are justified.        
	The controversy had cropped up a few months after public schools in the state suddenly decided to increase tuition fees. The fee hike intended was more than 100 per cent and it was argued that the extra amount was to be used to pay salaries for teachers as per recommendations of Sixth Pay Commission.        
	Parents in all the schools severely opposed the move saying it was too much of an increase to adjust, especially for middle class families. As the argument continued, the government intervened in the matter and allowed 25 per cent of hike in the fee.        
	Later, the parents filed a petition with the high court, which directed the schools to continue readmission in old fee structure until final order was passed. The schools have ever since stopped collecting tuition fee.         
	We have never refused to pay the fee. Its a cheap game and a matter of contempt to court, said parents association secretary Akshaya Mahakud.        
	They have been misguiding our children, saying that their parents are responsible for such a situation, Arun Prasad Bisoi, a parent, alleged.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Suchitra                                   
	Mumbai, Aug. 25: Star-singer Suchitra Krishnamoorthy and two TV actresses were today booked for employing minors as servants even as orders were given for the arrest of a TV star who got bail last week for allegedly inflicting burns on her 10-year-old maid.         
	Maharashtra labour secretary Kavita Gupta said Suchitra, ex-wife of filmmaker Shekhar Kapur, had employed a girl from Meghalaya. The two TV stars booked were Laxmi and Uma Khan. NGOs had rescued the minors recently. They lodged complaints with the labour departments help. We have initiated action under the child labour and juvenile justice acts, Gupta said.         
	A PTI report said Suchitra denied the allegations.         
	Employing children below 14 is banned, Gupta said. The punishment is a fine of Rs 20,000 or a jail term of six months to two years, or both. But Gupta didnt say when those charged today would be arrested.        
	The cases came as labour minister Nawab Malik ordered the rearrest of Urvashi Dhanorkar on charges of abusing her maid. Urvashi had secured bail a day after her arrest last week.

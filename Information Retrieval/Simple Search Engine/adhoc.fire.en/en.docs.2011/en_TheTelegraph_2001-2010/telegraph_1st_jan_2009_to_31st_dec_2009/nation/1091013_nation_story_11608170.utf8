The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tenant can be evicted for trade: SC
                                                                                                               Tenant can be evicted for trade: SC
                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 12 (PTI): A tenant can be evicted if the landlord wants to start his own business on the rented premises, even if he or she has no prior experience in the trade, the Supreme Court has ruled.        
	A bench held that if a landlord has a genuine need of the rented premises to start a new business and is able to prove his claim, he cannot be denied the premises.        
	A person can start a new business even if he has no experience in the new business. That does not mean that his claim for starting the new business must be rejected on the ground that it is a false claim, it said.        
	The bench was hearing the appeal of a landlord, Ram Babu Agarwal, challenging a Madhya Pradesh High Court ruling.         
	The high court had concurred with the trial courts ruling that since the landlord had experience only of running a cloth business, the plea for taking the premises to start a footwear business did not appear to be a genuine claim.        
	Ram Babu then moved the apex court, which rejected the reasoning of the lower courts.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Salt Lake to -17C, for Pole position
                                                                                                               Salt Lake to -17C, for Pole position

	Hardangervidda (Norway), Feb. 28: For Aparna Ray it is all a bit different from Salt Lake in Calcutta where it is not very often she has experienced snow blizzards or temperatures plunging to -17C. In fact, the 27-year-old fresh recruit into the Indian Foreign Service had not seen snow before.         
	But here in Hardangervidda, 1,245 metres high up in the Norwegian plateau, with snow blizzards a regular occurrence and temperatures plunging to -17C, conditions are ideally treacherous for her to join a group of 16 training for an all-women Commonwealth expedition to the South Pole later this year.         
	Training with Aparna is 38-year-old mountaineering instructor Reena Dharmshaktu who has had plenty of experience in climbing Himalayan peaks, including Argan Kangri in the Karakoram range and Kailash in Garwal.         
	Its a bit cold but I love it, Aparna told the Hardanger Folkeblad, a local Norwegian paper, which was amused to discover the novice Indian snow princess had never been on skis before.         
	I feel like a penguin, Aparna admitted.         
	But it is skis the women will have to use as they journey from the edge of the Antarctic 500 miles to the South Pole.         
	Of the 16 women brought to Norway for training  two each from the UK, India, Cyprus, Ghana, Singapore, Brunei, New Zealand and Jamaica  one will be picked from each country while the other will be kept in reserve.         
	The expedition will start in late November or December with the intention of arriving at the South Pole on January 1, 2010. Thats the plan, anyway.         
	Reena and Aparna have come to Norway patriotically equipped with an Indian flag which will travel with one of them to the South Pole.         
	Locals point out that the Norwegian Roald Amundsen, who led an Antarctic expedition between 1910 and 1912 and was the first man to reach the South Pole, trained where exactly Aparna and Reena are now training. So did the British explorer Ernest Shackleton.         
	Amundsen got to the South Pole ahead of Captain Robert Scott, who perished with the other four members of his British team on the return journey. Wishing not to be a burden on the other members of his team, Captain Lawrence Oates walked out into the night after bidding farewell to Scott with typical British understatement: Im just going outside, and may be some time.         
	Aparna and Reena, who have had a taste of night blizzards during three days out in the open when visibility drops to practically zero, have modern equipment such as global positioning systems.         
	But as The Telegraph has discovered all too quickly, the night can bring greater hidden dangers when one false step can mean a broken leg or worse.         
	Team leader Felicity Aston is experienced in the ways of the Antarctic. She has been studying maps with Aparna, Reena and the others with a view to avoiding crevasses which experts warn can be hundreds of metres deep.         
	Aparna and Reena will shortly learn which one goes through.

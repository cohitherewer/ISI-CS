The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pranab gets Brown nod
                                                                                                               Pranab gets Brown nod
          AMIT ROY                              
	London, Sept. 5: The recession is easing but the world economies are not out of danger yet  that is the gist of Pranab Mukherjees message to the G20 finance ministers summit in London.        
	His wish list is as follows: he wants western governments to go on pumping money into their respective economies rather than start cutting back prematurely on public spending, not resort to protectionist measures, seek an early agreement on free trade and a conclusion to the Doha round of the WTO talks, and reform the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to give countries like India a bigger say in their governance.        
	How quickly India is able to return to the high growth rates of two or three years ago will depend on how soon the west is able to recover, according to the Indian finance minister who appears to have won a wide measure of support  especially from Gordon Brown  for his common sense views.        
	After a meeting yesterday of finance ministers from the Bric countries  Brazil, Russia, India and China  Mukherjee pointed out: Emerging markets were not the cause of the ongoing financial crisis as their financial systems were conservatively regulated. Their growth prospects have nevertheless been badly damaged.        
	He then gave a sober assessment of Indias prospects: I expect India to grow between 6-7 per cent in both 2009 and 2010 on the back of strong fiscal and monetary measures that saw the central bank repeatedly lower its benchmark interest rates.        
	 However, a return to earlier levels of 9 per cent trend growth on a sustainable basis hinges on stabilisation of western markets, he warned. The recovery would be greatly assisted if international trade is kept open.        
	He added: We are keen for an early, successful conclusion of the stalled Doha round. Emerging markets also need to guard against tendencies in some developed countries to extend protectionism beyond trade to financial markets and investment, which could collectively undermine not only growth in developing countries but also the hard earned welfare gains from globalisation.        
	His views were reflected in the communiqu from the Bric countries: We welcome the first signs that the global economy is beginning to improve and that the worst of the crisis may be behind us. Despite these positive signs, it is too early to declare the end of the crisis. The global economy still faces great uncertainty, and significant risks remain to economic and financial stability.        
	It recommended: G-20 countries should continue implementing countercyclical fiscal and monetary policies in sustainable and internationally co-ordinated manner. Protectionism remains a real threat to the global economy and should be avoided, both in direct and indirect forms.        
	Some European countries, including France and Germany, want a cap on excessive bonuses paid to bankers, whose reckless behaviour is, at least, partly blamed for the worlds economies woes.        
	But an Indian source said: This is not a big issue for India. Our bankers do not get these excessive bonuses.        
	The British Prime Minister appeared to go along today with what Mukherjee had to say  and the G20 ministers seemed persuaded.        
	Agreement on the need to keep pumping state money into recession-hit economies for as long as it takes to return to sustainable growth came after Brown warned the G20 that the worlds tentative recovery from the downturn would be at risk if they repeated the mistakes of the 1930s and withdrew fiscal stimulus packages too soon.        
	Noting that less than half of the promised 5 trillion US dollars in fiscal stimulus has so far been delivered, Brown told the summit that countries should co-ordinate their exit strategy from recession, which must be put into action only when recovery is firmly in place.        
	He used words that Mukherjee might almost have written: It is clear in my view that too early a withdrawal of vital support could undermine the tentative signs of recovery we are now seeing and lead to a further downward lurch in business and consumer confidence, reducing growth and employment and worsening governments debt problems over the longer term. The stakes are simply too high to get these judgments wrong, so to decide now that it is time to start withdrawing or reversing the exceptional measures we have taken would, in my judgment, be a serious mistake.

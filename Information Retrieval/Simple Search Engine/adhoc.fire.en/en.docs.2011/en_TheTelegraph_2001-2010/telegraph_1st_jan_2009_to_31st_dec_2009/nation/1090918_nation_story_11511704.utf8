          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Sept. 17: Amendments to Indias 15-year-old law on organ transplants approved by the Union Cabinet today will expand the list of family donors, add safeguards to prevent trade in organs and seek to promote cadaver donations.        
	The proposed amendments to the law governing organ transplantation in India will add grandchildren and grandparents to the existing list of potential related donors within a family comprising siblings, parents, children and spouses.        
	The Centre had passed the Transplantation of Human Organs Act in 1994 to ban the sale of human organs, to allow organ harvesting from cadavers, and to regulate the retrieval of organs from live, related donors. But over the past decade, only about 1,500 transplants have involved cadavers, although doctors estimate that about 2,500 kidney transplants and 100 liver transplants are conducted each year.        
	But  despite the law  some doctors have come under investigation in recent years for their involvement in commercial organ trade. And transplant doctors themselves believe the law has prevented donations from genuine related donors.         
	The amendments approved today will also allow families to swap organs  allowing unrelated donors to exchange organs without commercial transactions  when such transplants are medically feasible.         
	The government has also proposed a nationwide organ transplantation network that will aim at getting hospitals to maintain databases of patients requiring transplants and keep track of organs when they become available to be matched for waiting patients.        
	But that is a long-term goal that will take time. Well need infrastructure, transplantation surgeons, and widespread public education to increase cadaver donations, said Harsha Jauhari, chairman of the renal transplantation division at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi, who was one of the experts who helped the government prepare the amendments.        
	A major feature of the amendment, Jauhari said, was that it would introduce the concept of required request under which doctors would be obliged to ask patients whether they would consider donating their organs should such circumstances emerge. The idea is to get people to understand this concept of cadaver donation in a non-crisis situation, Jauhari said.        
	Medical experts have long argued that the government needs to invest in public education on cadaver donations.

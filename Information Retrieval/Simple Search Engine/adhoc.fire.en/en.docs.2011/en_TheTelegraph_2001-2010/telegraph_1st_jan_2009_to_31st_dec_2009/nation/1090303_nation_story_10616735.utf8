          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                               
	New Delhi, March 2: India, which today rejected as malicious and mischievous media reports in Bangladesh about alleged BSF activity on the border, is seriously studying at least one conspiracy theory behind the mutiny in the neighbouring country.        
	According to intelligence sources, the version goes like this: a day before the mutiny at the darbar of the Bangladesh Rifles director-general, a BDR soldier had approached Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and complained about service conditions vis--vis the army. Hasina had addressed the army and lauded its efforts but had spoken nothing of the BDRs contribution.         
	At the darbar on the morning of February 25, a BDR soldier was slapped by a senior officer. After that, it is learnt that the ADC to the director-general, fearing that the soldier may harm the senior officer, shot the man, a senior home ministry official said. The BDR soldiers then ran amok, many of them rushing to get weapons.         
	As this was happening, a grey-coloured vehicle came and 10 to 15 men clad in BDR uniforms sped to the area and started shooting indiscriminately, the sources said.        
	It is at this point, the sources said, that Indian agencies smell a rat.         
	There is strong suspicion here that the gunmen were already present on the Pilkhana premises and could not have entered after the first bullet had killed a BDR soldier, the sources said.         
	BSF sources have also reported that there were around 495 Jamaat-e-Islami-supported BDR soldiers at the darbar. The Jamaat is known to have close ties with Pakistans ISI, whose hand is being seen in the mutiny.         
	Indian agencies continue to be worried about most of the 700 armed BDR men still at large who are feared to have been lured by the Jamaat.         
	BSF director-general M.L. Kumawat said they were dangerous and if they did fall into the Jamaats trap, they would be no different from militants trying to cross over to India. We are in the highest state of alert, he said.        
	India also strongly reacted to reports in the Daily Star, Independent and the Bangladesh Observer that claimed that the BSF, taking advantage of the situation in Bangladesh, had started fencing work and other construction activity within 150 yards of the zero line.         
	These reports are malicious and mischievous created by vested interests to cause a dent in the existing BSF-BDR relations which are highly cordial, cooperative and excellent, Kumawat said.

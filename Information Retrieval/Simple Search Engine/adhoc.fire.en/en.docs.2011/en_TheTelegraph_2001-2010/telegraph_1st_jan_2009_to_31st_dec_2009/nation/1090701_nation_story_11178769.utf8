	Patna, June 30 (PTI): To make more than 50,000 youths self-employed every year, a training institute will be opened in every Bihar district by the end of 2009, the state government said today.        
	Deputy chief minister S.K. Modi said though a project to set up rural development amp; employment training institutes was launched, so far the state has been successful in opening only eight such institutes in 38 districts.        
	The programme, to be funded by Nabard, was to be run by nationalised banks that were supposed to start training programmes in 30 districts towards the end of 2009, he said. We want more youths to undergo the self-employment programme for which the banks have agreed to extend loans if they wish to pursue a career as entrepreneurs later, he added. State officials would help banks to obtain private houses on rent till they acquire land to construct the buildings, he said.        
	Describing it as an ambitious plan, Modi said that the government is keen to train at least 50,000 youths for the programme.         
	UGC pay debate

His assurance came after legislative council members, cutting across party lines, raised the issue for the second day while seeking implementation of the revised UGC pay scale.

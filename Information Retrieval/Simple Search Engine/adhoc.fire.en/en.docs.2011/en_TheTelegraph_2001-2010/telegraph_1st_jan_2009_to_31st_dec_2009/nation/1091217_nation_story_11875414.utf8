	Cuttack, Dec. 16: Wary of an attack by a swarm of bees, the Orissa Cricket Association (OCA) has launched Operation Honeycomb at the Barabati Stadium ahead of the December 21 India-Sri Lanka one-day international match.        
	OCA secretary Asirbad Behera said: From a safety standpoint, we are making sure that no exposed honeycomb is left dangling in linear sections from the ceiling of any gallery, when thousands of people gather to watch the match.        
	The OCA faced a similar predicament before the India-England ODI in November 2008. A quick visit from bee collectors fixed the hives then. But the bee collectors had apparently left a little something behind. They did not take the honeycomb, so the bees came back again.        
	The honeybees had proliferated on the outer roof of the galleries at the Mahanadi end and produced eight massive honeycombs, registering a fourfold increase in their number. Bee wranglers have been engaged since Tuesday to evict the bees. In fact, all the honeycombs are being destroyed by setting them on fire to prevent possible bee invasion during the ODI. They are expected to complete the work today, an OCA official said.        
	Pitch invasions by bees are not totally unheard of at the Barabati Stadium where honeycombs have been a part of the gallery structures for some years now.         
	On January 10, 2007, players and umpires of an Orissa-Assam Ranji Trophy tie were forced to go to the ground with faces down when a swarm of bees made their way to the playing area. Fortunately, no one was injured.

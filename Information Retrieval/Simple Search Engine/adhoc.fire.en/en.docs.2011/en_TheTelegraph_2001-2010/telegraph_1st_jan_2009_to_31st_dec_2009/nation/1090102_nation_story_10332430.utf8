The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Big-bang education scheme on cabinet table 
                                                                                                               Big-bang education scheme on cabinet table 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                          
	New Delhi, Jan. 1: The UPA government is ready to roll out its single largest education scheme aimed at making every child complete school, after key arms settled differences over funding ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.        
	The government is tomorrow introducing before the cabinet the finalised version of the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan, a mammoth campaign to universalise secondary education, The Telegraph has learnt.         
	The scheme was announced in the 2006 budget speech and was to be launched by 2007 with the start of the Eleventh Five Year Plan. But crucial differences between the human resource development ministry on the one hand and the Planning Commission and the finance ministry on the other held it up.         
	Now, though, the scheme is expected to be cleared by the cabinet either tomorrow or later this month, allowing the government some months to reap political benefits from it.        
	It is likely to be the UPAs New Year gift to the nation, a senior government official said.         
	The scheme will cost the central exchequer Rs 20,120 crore over the rest of the Eleventh Plan period, according to the final agreement between the differing departments, top government officials said.         
	The HRD ministry had asked for Rs 38,000 crore over the Eleventh Plan for the scheme, modelled on the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, Indias largely successful programme to universalise elementary education, sources said.         
	But the Planning Commission refused to spare the amount at a time the country was in the grip of a financial crunch.         
	The final draft allocates Rs 50,000 a year as grant for each of 6,000 new model schools that are being set up separately from the scheme but are intended to assist it. The scheme is to fund their upkeep.         
	For the past four months, the HRD ministry and the Planning Commission had argued over the grant for the schools.         
	The HRD ministry had asked for Rs 85,000 a year for each school, but the Planning Commission said it would give Rs 10,000.         
	Three newspapers cost me Rs 300 a month or Rs 3,600 a year. The Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan also requires a minimum number of library books per student. Just the newspapers and the books will cost much more than Rs 10,000, leave aside electricity or other bills, an HRD ministry official said.         
	A third key dispute now settled was on the sharing of the financial burden between the Centre and states.         
	Under the final draft now before the cabinet, the Centre will fund 75 per cent of the scheme till at least 2012  the end of the Eleventh Plan. States are to fund the remaining 25 per cent during this period.         
	The Planning Commission wants the funding pattern to be 50:50 between the Centre and the states for the Twelfth Plan. But the HRD ministry is arguing that the Centre should agree to continue funding 75 per cent of the scheme for the first five years.         
	Our experience with the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan shows that states rarely keep their end of the financial commitment. The more we depend on states, the more the scheme will suffer, an HRD ministry official said.

	Chandigarh, Aug. 2 (PTI): A technician of the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research and a counsellor with the state AIDS control society have been arrested for allegedly raping an HIV positive woman two years ago, police said today.        
	James, the technician, and Nek Ram, the counsellor with the Chandigarh AIDS Control Society, were arrested on Friday.         
	They sought sexual favours from the woman for giving her medicines for free, the police said. The two knew she was HIV positive, so they used condoms, they said.

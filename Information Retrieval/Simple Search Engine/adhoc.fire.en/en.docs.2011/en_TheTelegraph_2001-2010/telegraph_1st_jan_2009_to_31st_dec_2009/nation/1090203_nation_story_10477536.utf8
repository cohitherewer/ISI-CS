	New Delhi, Feb. 2: China will participate in a major military exhibition in India for the first time, with the deputy chief of its air force leading a 10-member delegation to Aero India to be held in Bangalore from February 11 to 15.         
	Pakistan has not been invited.         
	The invitation to China comes after two successive years in which the Indian and Chinese armies have held company-level joint military exercises and their navies elementary joint drills.         
	Aero India has been held in Bangalore every second year since 1996. It is primarily an exhibition of aviation systems. India invites friendly countries to participate in such events.         
	Asked why Pakistan was not invited, defence production secretary Pradeep Kumar, one of the conveners of Aero India 2009, said: India does not invite Pakistan to military events.

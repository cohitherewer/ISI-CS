	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 8: The Central University of Orissa, being run from a makeshift campus at Koraput, has zeroed in on another campus to be inaugurated in 2009 academic year.

	Talking to newspersons here, the VC said that the university would be setting up five new schools by 2010.         
	The proposed centres will include schools of basic and health sciences and of development, indigenous and bio-diversity studies.        
	The full-fledged green campus of the university, coming up over an area of 450 acres, is expected to be functional within three years.         
	The blueprint has been finalised. A tentative master plan has also been drawn, she added.

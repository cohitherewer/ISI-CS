	New Delhi, Oct. 5: Delhi police today won two prizes in court  alleged Maoist Khobad Ghandy and a packet of chocolates.        
	Ghandy, 58, in judicial custody since his arrest last month, was sent to three days police remand for questioning after his lawyer failed to turn up in court.        
	The reed-thin Ghandy appeared in court clutching a bottle of mineral water. He left protesting his police remand, pleading he was too ill to be moved around and that he was handicapped in the absence of his lawyer.        
	As he was being led away, a friend quickly shoved a packet of chocolates into his hand. Ghandys eyes lit up but the police immediately snatched it from him. The prisoner gave his friend a rueful smile.        
	If Ghandy is to be believed, the chocolate was the polices only gain. I am just a writer and to say that I am a prize catch just because I write for the Maoists is a bit too much, he said.        
	Earlier, waiting in the court, the alleged CPI (Maoist) politburo member had told The Telegraph that what the doctors told him during his check-up was different from what the medical report produced in court said.        
	The doctor at the hospital said my cardiac tests were inconclusive and that I needed angiography. He referred my case to neurology. The tests were to be done today.        
	The report handed to the court allegedly said Ghandy did not need hospital treatment at the moment.        
	There was brief confusion in the court as Ghandy searched for his lawyer, who later claimed he hadnt been informed his client would be produced today. Ghandys judicial remand was to expire tomorrow. Police officers refused to explain why they had rushed to get his custody a day early.        
	The accused demanded the hearing be postponed. I am not well, I have been advised tests by doctors of the GB Pant Hospital which were to be conducted today but didnt happen. I am suffering from cancer and need medical supervision and cannot be moved from one place to the other, Ghandy told the magistrate.        
	The police said they wanted to take Ghandy to Mumbai and that they suspected he knew about Maoist networks in Delhi and other parts of the country.         
	Sources said Ghandy had told his sister, who met him in Tihar jail on Saturday, that he had been denied his prescribed blood pressure medicine and that he felt dizzy without them.

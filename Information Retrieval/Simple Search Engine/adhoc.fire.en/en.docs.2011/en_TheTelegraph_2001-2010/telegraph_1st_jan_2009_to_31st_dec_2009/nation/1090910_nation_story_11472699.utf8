          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Patna, Sept. 9: Cyclonic weather notwithstanding, the state is more apprehensive of the rebel threat that looms large over five of the seven Assembly seats going to polls tomorrow.         
	We have decided to deploy armed forces around all booths in the five constituencies, said a spokesperson at police headquarters, adding: The districts will have as much force at its disposal as it had during the Lok Sabha polls.         
	Seats going to polls tomorrow include Bochaha, Aurai, Kalyanpur, Warisnagar, Ramgarh, Chainpur and Chenari, of which Chenari, Bochara, Aurai and Chainpur are Maoist pockets.        
	Joint chief election commissioner K. Anshumali said: Bihar had a peaceful Lok Sabha polls and we will ensure that the trend continues. He added that despite disturbances caused by the weather, forces, including mounted police, officials and electronic voting machines have been transported to the constituencies. The administration has set a different poll timetable for seats in the rebel zones, which will vote between 7am and 3am, while in normal areas it will continue till 5pm.        
	Of the eight, Ramgarh is a crucial seat for Lalu Prasad, as it was the pocket borough of RJD leader Jagdanand Singh till he quit to become an MP from Buxar by defeating BJPs Lalmuni Choubey. The NDA will try hard to wrest it from RJD in the absence of Jagdanand in fray.         
	The rest of the 11 seats will go to polls on September 17.         
	The embattled Lalu, who recently saw the exit of senior leaders such as Taslimuddin and Shyam Razak, has described the current by-poll as a semi-final test before the general elections. The by-election will set the stage for next years final battle, he said, predicting: The RJD and LJP will make up for the Lok Sabha loss.        
	Congress, too, campaigned hard, describing the party as a natural alternative to the NDA and RJD-LJP combination. Results will reflect if their efforts paid off.

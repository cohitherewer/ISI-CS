          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Rahman at the dargah                                   
	Kadapa, Feb. 28: A.R. Rahman rushed to place both his Oscars before the tomb of a Sufi saint within hours of his arrival in India from Los Angeles.        
	The composer arrived at the Ameen Peer Dargah in Kadapa, 405km southwest of Hyderabad, to pray at the Hazrat Khwaja Syed Shah Ameenullah Malik Urs on its third and last day.        
	After the special Friday prayers, the tahleel fateha, he told reporters he never missed Urs at the shrine since he had sought spiritual guidance from the Peer throughout his life, on personal and professional matters. I believe I was able to win the Oscars only because of the blessings of the Almighty and the Peer of Ameen Peer Dargah.        
	Rahman  who wore a white pyjama, red kurta and the traditional white cap  arrived with his mother and brothers. He offered a chaddar and sought the Ameen Peers blessing. He knelt down to pray, with his family joining him.

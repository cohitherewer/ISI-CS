          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Jan. 13: Three members of a family were gunned down by their neighbours over a barking dog.        
	The stray dog ran into the house of Rajaram and Hemant Patel and charged at the brothers in Allahabads Chandrabhanpur village around 10am today after a boy from the family next door threw a stone at it.         
	The dog was barking as it was hit by the boy, Surya Kumar Shukla, the Allahabad (rural) additional superintendent of police, said.         
	Neighbours watching the dog chase the brothers burst out laughing. Then, one of the neighbours told the embarrassed and angry Patels that Mahendra Singhs family had let the dog loose on them, Shukla said.         
	The two families, which had been fighting over irrigation for some time, started hurling abuses at each other. During the fight, Hemant allegedly brought out his licensed rifle and opened fire on his neighbours.         
	Mahendra, 38, his wife Seema Devi, 27, and mother Champa Devi, 65, were hit. They were declared dead on arrival in hospital.         
	Rajaram and another person have been arrested but Hemant is missing. Police have seized his rifle.         
	Sonkar Singh, a relative of the victims family to which the boy who threw the stone also belongs, told the police tempers had been frayed because of an ongoing dispute over running water in their fields.         
	The difference in caste  Singhs are Thakurs and the Patels are Kurmis  added to the tension between the affluent farming families. Todays incident acted as the trigger for violence, Sonkar added.

	New Delhi, Oct. 2: Around 40 protesters belonging to the Tamil Nadu-based Puthiya Tamizhagam entered the Sri Lankan high commission premises in Chanakyapuri here around 3pm today and damaged some property, police said.        
	No one was injured. It all happened in two minutes. Before police could swing into action, they had fled. No one could be arrested, said additional commissioner of police (New Delhi) S. Dass.        
	These people were Tamils extending support to Tamils in Sri Lanka. They were prepared and had arrived along with news channel reporters. We are seeking video footage from news channels to identify those who stormed the high commission, said Dass.

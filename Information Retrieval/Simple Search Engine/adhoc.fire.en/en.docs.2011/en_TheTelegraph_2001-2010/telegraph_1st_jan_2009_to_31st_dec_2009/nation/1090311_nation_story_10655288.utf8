          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, March 10: His name is first on the Team India sheet but Mahendra Singh Dhoni seems unable to make it to a far less exclusive list  the countrys electoral rolls.        
	The names of the Indian cricket captain and his family members are missing from the voter list in their hometown Ranchi, Dhonis brother-in-law Gautam Gupta has said.        
	Jharkhands chief electoral officer, Debashis Gupta, said he had ordered Ranchi deputy commissioner Rajiv Arun Ekka to look into the matter.        
	Somebody has said that (the names are missing) and I have asked it to be looked into, Gupta said, adding that voter registration was done by the sub-divisional officer.        
	We are looking into the matter. If his (Dhoni) and his family members names are actually missing from the electoral rolls, it will be rectified soon, Ekka said.                    
	Gupta said names can be registered till the last date of the filing of nomination by candidates.        
	Ranchi goes to the polls on April 23, and April 4 is the last date candidates can file nomination.        
	Its not clear if Dhoni will be in Ranchi to vote on April 23. The Indian Premier League will be on then and Dhoni will be busy playing for Chennai.        
	The president of the Dhoni Fan Club, Jitendra Singh, said there should be a provision for the cricketer and his family to vote through postal ballots or any other means, a PTI report said.

          OUR BUREAU AND PTI                                     
	New Delhi, March 29: Mamata Banerjees comrade in Singur, Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh, wants her to return the favour by leaving his party one seat to contest in Bengal.         
	Singh, who was at the Trinamul Congress chiefs side during the land protest in Singur, today said his party would field 10 candidates in Bengal unless Mamata agreed to leave a seat for the Samajwadis, a PTI report said.         
	The Samajwadi leader clarified that no candidate would be put up against the Trinamul chief or Pranab Mukherjee, the Bengal state Congress president.         
	Trinamul, however, ruled out giving any seat to the Samajwadis. We have already finalised our list of candidates and there is no chance to accommodate the Samajwadi Party in it, said Subrata Bakshi, Trinamuls Bengal president.         
	Singh also announced that talks with the Congress on allowing the Samajwadis Abu Asim Azmi to contest from the Mumbai North-West seat had failed  the latest indicator of a stuttering relationship between the parties.         
	The Congress formally informed us this morning that it would not be able to part with the Mumbai North-West seat. With this, I have to announce with a heavy heart that the SP will contest the maximum number of seats in Maharashtra, Singh told PTI.         
	The party, Singh said, would not have contested anywhere against the Congress and the NCP in Maharashtra had it been given the seat.

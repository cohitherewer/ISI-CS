The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Jaya seeks nay, not aye
                                                                                                               Jaya seeks nay, not aye
          G.C. SHEKHAR                      Jayalalithaa                          
	Chennai, Aug. 17: For probably the first time, a major party is asking supporters to use an option at the booths that usually signifies a voters rejection of Indias parties and politicians.        
	The ADMK, which is boycotting tomorrows five Assembly by-elections in Tamil Nadu, wants its voters to use Rule 49- to declare they do not approve of any of the candidates in the fray. Under 49-, a five-decade-old but seldom exercised option, voters can give this in writing to the presiding officer.        
	It is strange for a major political party to opt for 49-. The provision has been the choice only of voters unhappy with the performance of our political parties, said columnist Gnani Sankaran, a campaigner for the use of 49- to clean up Indian politics.        
	For the ADMK, the ploy signifies a change of tactics after initially advising supporters to stay off the booths.        
	The new tactic became necessary because the ruling DMK is pulling out the stops to ensure at least 70 per cent voting, using incentives and methods that have produced up to 89 per cent turnouts at recent elections.        
	Although the DMK is confident of winning by huge margins without straining itself, it believes a large turnout would be the real victory, signalling a popular rejection of Jayalalithaas boycott call.        
	But the ADMKs new plan faces the hurdle of popular ignorance about 49-.        
	Our local functionaries are visiting our supporters and asking them to exercise the 49- option. Since all the five seats are rural, most voters are not aware of the option. What symbol will that be on the EVM? they are asking, an ADMK district secretary rued.        
	To ensure fair play, the states chief electoral officer, Naresh Gupta, has advised polling officials to register the 49- option if the voters prefer it. Its not present as an option on the EVMs but the voter can always write against his name on the casting register that he does not want to vote for any of the above, Gupta said.        
	But the DMK wants to deny the ADMK even that consolation prize. Earlier, parties used to give money to voters to vote for their party, but this time we are being given money to merely go and vote, said K. Palanisamy, a voter in Cumbum.         
	When more people vote and the DMK wins easily, it signifies greater public support, a DMK minister said.        
	Party election managers have been told to get the voters to the booths as they had done during a bypoll in December, when the turnout was 89 per cent.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 22: The Samajwadi Party erred in helping the Congress revive its fortunes in Uttar Pradesh, Mulayam Singh Yadav said today, and called his decision to support the UPA in last years trust vote a political mistake.         
	We eliminated the Congress. Laluji (Lalu Prasad) in Bihar and me in Uttar Pradesh, and we only helped revive it. I believe we really made a mistake, Mulayam said during zero hour in the Lok Sabha, looking towards Sonia Gandhi. Mulayam was seated next to RJD chief Lalu Prasad, who the Congress refused to take back in the UPA after the elections where the two parties fought against each other.        
	The Samajwadi chief alleged that the Congress had a history of using allies and then dumping them.        
	I think sometimes... had we not supported you at the time (trust vote), you wouldnt have had the guts to call elections. And because of the support at that time, you are now back in power. And you throw us away, he added.        
	The Samajwadis and the Congress couldnt arrive at a seat deal for the Lok Sabha polls in Uttar Pradesh and fought separately.

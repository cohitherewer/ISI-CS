          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, July 2: An ongoing operation adopted by the state excise department based on police intelligence inputs has borne fruit with the detection of large-scale ganja (canabis) cultivation taking place in Orissas Maoist-affected regions.         
	The department had undertaken a massive operation after a state CID report indicated that ganja cultivation, which is banned under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, was being undertaken extensively at the behest of Maoists. Justice P.K. Mohanty Commission Report on the activities of mafia had also indicated proliferation of ganja in rebel-hit districts under the support of Chasi Mulia Samiti, supported by CPI(Maoist).        
	The operation, excise officials said, had continued for an year, but recently stumbled upon large-scale cultivation of the drug in 11 of the 30 districts. They had destroyed plants worth Rs 780 crore. According to the excise records, 65 lakh plants were set on fire by a special squad in Malkangiri alone.                     
	While more than 2.5 lakh ganja plants were destroyed each in Gajapati, Sambalpur and Angul districts, over a lakh such illegally grown plants were wiped out in Deogarh and Boudh districts.         
	These regions, excise officials said, had apparently turned into haven for illegal ganja cultivators due to inaccessibility and the patronage of Maoists.        
	The villagers were being paid money to cultivate ganja in their farmlands and backyards and later the crop was being collected through conduits, a senior excise official said.         
	More and more innocent villagers were being lured into the illegal cultivation as they reportedly managed to earn nearly Rs 1,800 from a single plant, he added.         
	With nearly 78 lakh ganja plants destroyed during the ongoing operation, ganja plantations were also traced in Kandhamal, Ganjam, Nayagarh, Jagatsinghpur and Cuttack. Cases were registered against over 10,000 persons found involved in ganja cultivation.        
	Several thousands of hectares of encroached forestland dominated by CPI (Maoists) had been utilised for ganja cultivation.

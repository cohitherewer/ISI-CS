The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Left hopes to unite for coming polls
                                                                                                               Left hopes to unite for coming polls
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, Feb. 17: Just three Lok Sabha polls ago, Jehanabad was the pocket borough of the CPI.         
	But now, the party stands nowhere in the constituency, represented by Nitish Kumar-led JD(U) in the Lok Sabha. In fact, the RJD that won the seat in the 1999 election and trailed second in the last poll enjoys a bigger presence there.         
	Like Jehanabad, mainstream Left, comprising the CPI and CPM, has seized to rule in Patna, Bhagalpur, Buxar, Munger, Begusarai (once called Bihars Leningrad), Madhubani and Purnea.        
	The present Lok Sabha has no Left representative from the state of Bihar and Bihars main players  RJD and LJP still describing the Left as friends  have not found the time to approach the leadership for seat sharing issues.        
	We will talk to the Left after poll, as they are a truly secular force and trusted friends, said Lalu Prasad. Despite Lalus insistence, a senior UPA member saw no scope for the Left-RJD alliance as the parties (Left) enjoyed little grassroots presence in the state.        
	But things may change soon. The Left parties in Bihar  CPI, CPM and CPI (ML) Liberation  have, for the first time now, closed ranks and decided to contest the coming polls in full alliance, targeting the BJP led-NDA over the communalism issue and the Congress-led UPA over the Indo-US civil nuclear deal.         
	Earlier, the CPI and CPM stayed in alliance combining with Lalu Prasad since 1989. However, this is for the first time that the CPI (ML) Liberation has been included.        
	The party is a pro-Naxalite outfit that came into being in the wake of Charu Majumdar-sponsored revolt against Bengals CPM in Naxalbari (Bengal) in 1968.         
	It remained underground carrying out an armed struggle till 1990 and still has its armed squads active in areas and has always treated CPM and CPI its adversaries.         
	In fact, the CPI (ML) Liberation prospered at the cost of the CPI and the CPM uniting the weaker sections against the landlords represented by the other parties in Jehanabad, Begusarai, Patna and Buxar.         
	However, the emergence of Lalu Prasad as the messiah of backward classes has weakened the CPI (ML) Liberation cause.         
	Majority of Dalit forces that were trained by the party are now a part of the CPI (Maoist)  the rebel outfit that does not believe in the electoral system much like the pre-1990 CPI (ML) Liberation.         
	In fact, the party still has daggers drawn with the CPM in Bengal over the Nandigram. The alliance will give a new direction to states politics, said the general secretary of the CPI (ML) Liberation, Dipankar Bhattacharya.         
	Observers, however, have their doubts. You can not entrust even a single seat to the Left despite their present professed unity, said a senior Congress leader.

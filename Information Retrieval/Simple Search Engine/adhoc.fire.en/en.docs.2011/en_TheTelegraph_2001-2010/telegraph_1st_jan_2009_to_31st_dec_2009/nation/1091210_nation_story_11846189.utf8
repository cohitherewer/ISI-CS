The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nepal revives tank demand
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Nepal revives tank demand
          SUJAN DUTTA                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 9: Nepals army has revived a five-year-old request for supply of tanks in the run-up to this weeks visit by its chief, General Chhattraman Singh Gurung.        
	Requests have also been made for artillery guns, Insas rifles, ammunition, troop carriers, bullet-proof jackets and sighting equipment.         
	India has been supplying non-lethal equipment to Nepal, but now has to take a call on whether to resume gifting firearms.        
	Indian army officers were tickled by the request for tanks today  as they were when the request was first made  with one officer wondering aloud if Mount Everest would be renamed tank-top should Nepals army drive one of them to the peak.        
	The joke about tanks possibly arose as they are used in the plains. Seventy-five per cent of Nepal is mountainous. A defence ministry source said Nepal had asked for 100 tanks in two phases at concessional rates.         
	The source said enquiries were made about Ajeya (T-72), the tanks of Russian origin. The Ajeya is the main tank of the Indian Army but is being replaced by the modern Bhishma (T-90), also of Russian origin.        
	Nepals fresh request underlines just how much the threat perceptions of the countrys army have started to mirror those in the last days of the monarchy in 2005-06.         
	New Delhi cannot afford to take Nepals requests lightly: when it turned down similar requests from Sri Lanka as the island nation was going to war with the LTTE, Colombo was forced to source military equipment from China and Pakistan.        
	With a 1,700km open border with Nepal, India will be circumspect about increasing Chinese influence in that country.        
	In its earlier avatar as the Royal Nepal Army, the erstwhile kingdoms military was almost wholly dependent on India for training and supplies. These were suspended in 2005.        
	Army chief Gurung will be in India for a week starting Friday. He has a series of high-profile engagements lined up, including one where he will accept from President Pratibha Patil the title of Honorary Chief of Army Staff of India on December 14.        
	Gurung is being granted the kind of access that was reserved for Nepals army chiefs in the best days of the military relations between the two nations.         
	The relations were strained by the accession of King Gyanendra in 2005, the establishment of a republic and the possibility of Maoist cadres being inducted into Nepals army.        
	On December 14, the day he is conferred the title, Gurung will also attend a presentation in the office of the Indian army chief, General Deepak Kapoor, on Indian Security Perspectives.

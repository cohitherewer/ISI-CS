	Thiruvananthapuram, May 6: Keralas Left rulers have decided to advise the governor against giving the go-ahead to prosecute CPM state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan in the Lavalin power scam, triggering a shutdown call tomorrow by the Opposition.         
	The Congress-led UDF, which called the 12-hour state-wide strike, said the cabinet decision was a subversion of the rule of law to bail out a leader accused of corruption.        
	The CBI had sought the governors nod to prosecute Vijayan, a former power minister accused of flouting rules to award Canadian firm SNC Lavalin a Rs 390-crore contract to modernise three hydel plants.        
	But chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan told reporters today that the cabinet decided to go by the opinion given by advocate-general C.P. Sudhakara Prasad, who had cited insufficient grounds for prosecution.

	Mumbai, Oct. 22: What took his uncle 19 years, the nephew has done it in just three-and-a-half.         
	Bal Thackerays Shiv Sena, though established in 1966, tasted electoral success only in the 1985 Assembly elections.         
	On the other hand, estranged nephew Raj Thackeray  who makes fiery speeches on protecting Marathi manoos and even draws political cartoons like his uncle  has managed to win 13 seats in his debut Assembly elections.         
	Born in early 2006, Rajs Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) made its debut in the municipal elections in January 2007, winning 12 seats in Nashik and six in Pune, but failed to open its account in Mumbai where the Sena continued to rule.         
	In the Lok Sabha polls, MNS candidates impacted the results of nine of the 12 seats they contested, dividing the Sena-BJP votes and helping the Congress-NCP.         
	When counting began this morning, the MNS was leading in 16 seats and managed to win 13 by the end of the day.        
	The party did spectacularly in Mumbai, emerging with the second highest tally after the Congress, which won 17 seats, and edging out biggies like the NCP, BJP and the Sena, now led by Balasahebs son Uddhav Thackeray.         
	Of the 36 seats in Mumbai city and the suburbs, the MNS bagged six followed by the BJPs five, Senas four and NCPs three. It appeared to be displacing the Sena as the partys tally shrunk from nine in 2004 to just four in 2009.         
	Apart from Mumbais six, the MNS won all three seats in Nashik city, one in Pune, two in Kalyan, and one in Kannad constituency in southern Maharashtra. In seven of the 13 seats it has won, the MNS pushed Sena-BJP candidates to third or fourth position, and fought direct battles with the Congress-NCP combine.         
	The knockout punch was delivered in Mahim, where the Sena has its headquarters. MNS general secretary Nitin Sardesai beat Sena rebel and Congress candidate Sada Sarvankar by over 8,000 votes.         
	In some seats where the MNS did not win, it managed to divide enough votes to hand the Sena a defeat.         
	For instance in Dindoshi, Shalini Thakre, wife of Rajs cousin Jitendra, polled 39,500 votes while the Senas Sunil Prabhu lost the seat to the Congresss Rajhans Singh by 5,000-odd votes.         
	Raj said he was grateful to voters. I will ensure that I do not let down the faith they have shown. It is a good birthday gift for my mother.         
	He blamed the Sena-BJP for failing to counter the government despite 10 years of anti-incumbency.         
	The Opposition failed more than the Congress-NCP government. Despite having 120-odd MLAs, it failed as a good Opposition. My MLAs will now show how to shoulder the responsibility people have given us and get things done, Raj said.        
	Pointed out that his party had done well only in urban areas, Raj said: We have just started. We will get there.         
	Although Raj exchanged personal attacks with Uddhav during the campaign, he was reluctant to answer questions on the Senas decline or on his cousin.         
	Asked if his uncle had telephoned him on his success, he politely said: No.

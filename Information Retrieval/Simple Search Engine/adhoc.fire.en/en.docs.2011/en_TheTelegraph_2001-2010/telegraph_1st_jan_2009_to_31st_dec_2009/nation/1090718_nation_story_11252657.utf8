The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rahul rein-in signal to party in Rita row   Dont play into Maya hands is the message
                                                                                                               Rahul rein-in signal to party in Rita row     -  Dont play into Maya hands is the message
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Mayavati in Lucknow on Friday. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, July 17: The Congress wants to put a lid on the conflict with Mayavati and stick to Rahul Gandhis script of social inclusion. That is, treat the poor as poor regardless of their caste and work to empower them.        
	After the Amethi MP spoke out for the first time on Rita Bahuguna Joshis controversial remarks on the Uttar Pradesh chief minister, a source in Delhi said: Between the lines, the message was clear.        
	Through his focussed answers to the media, Rahuls idea was, Dont play into Mayavatis hands, said an Uttar Pradesh MP, who is in regular touch with Rahul.        
	Mayavati has found an issue to build on and rework her caste strategy after she failed to pull it off (in the Lok Sabha elections). Shes trying to make it a national issue and perhaps use it in the Maharashtra elections to consolidate the Dalits. Rahul wants to confine whatever impact the controversy has to Uttar Pradesh. Our workers will be told not to go overboard and do provocative things like burn Mayavatis effigies.        
	The Congresss feedback so far is that the controversy has been a bit of a morale-booster for the Bahujan Samaj Party but not to the extent Mayavati would have hoped for.        
	Sources compared it with the attack on her by Samajwadi Party activists in mid-1995 when Mayavati was about to withdraw support to the Mulayam Singh Yadav government and accept a BJP offer to become chief minister.        
	Samajwadi supporters had attacked the Lucknow State Guest House, where Mayavati was staying. Mayavati later said she would have been killed had it not been for the BJPs Lalji Tandon. That incident set off pitched battles between BSP and Samajwadi workers across Uttar Pradesh.        
	This time, even a BSP MP admitted that Joshis slur hadnt spurred his workers to take to the streets. The BSP workers have got used to the luxuries and spoils of power. They are not interested in agitation any longer; they want official posts and perks, the MP said.        
	The only limited benefit to Mayavati, the MP added, was that her core Jatav voters  who had been dormant during the Lok Sabha elections  were regrouping with the BSP.        
	But a Congress MP from west-central Uttar Pradesh said: That makes no difference to someone like me. In the May elections, I got the non-Jatav votes in my constituency. I have run a quick check and gathered that they are not worked up over Ritas remarks.        
	Party sources said that Rahul, apart from preparing the party for the four Assembly bypolls on August 18, had flagged three issues that the state Congress co-ordination committee would take up when it met in the next two weeks:        
	Reorganising the committees right down to the panchayats after the return of several prodigal sons and daughters who had left the Congress when it looked like a lost cause;        
	Reinforcing the social inclusion theme by giving more party posts to the backward castes, Dalits and Muslims;        
	Continuing to agitate against every unpopular move by Mayavati without personalising the campaign.

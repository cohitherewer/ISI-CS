	New Delhi, Nov. 16: Aligarh Muslim University will reopen on December 1 after a months closure following protests over a students death, vice-chancellor P.K. Abdul Azis said today, but tensions are unlikely to ease soon.         
	The university was closed sine die last month, triggering a wave of protests against the administration.         
	Azis also promised to consider a key demand of the students  to allow a union. He said he had set up a committee to evaluate the demand.        
	Azis said the university would also reconsider suspension orders issued against many of the around 80 students alleged to have participated in the violent protests.        
	But he controversially announced a move to amend regulations to restrict the impact of those opposed to his functioning. The opponents are members of the executive council, the universitys top decision-making body, and have accused Azis of corruption, nepotism and misadministration. They have been boycotting meetings to prevent the council from attaining the quorum to take decisions.        
	Azis said the university would try and amend regulations that make it a must for the council to have a certain quorum to take decisions.

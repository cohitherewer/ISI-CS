The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lone votes, after 22 years
                                                                                                               Lone votes, after 22 years

	Srinagar, May 13: His mother by his side, Sajjad Lone this morning trudged from his Handwara home to the poll booth 200 metres away  to vote for the second time in his life.        
	I have told Sajjad to work for the resolution of the Kashmir issue and to take it to those echelons of power where it has not reached so far, Hafiza Begum said, repeating yet again why her 43-year-old son had jumped into the fray.        
	Clad in black T-shirt and casual trousers and ringed by supporters, Sajjad walked to the booth set up at the Government Girls Higher Secondary School. The British-educated businessman tried to evoke the charm of his late father Abdul Ghani Lone, constantly shaking hands along the way with people who wished him luck.        
	People have accepted that my contesting is a change of strategy, not ideology. I am not here to lie to the people or distribute ration cards. My motive is to take the Kashmir issue to Parliament and facilitate its resolution, Sajjad said after casting his ballot.        
	The last time Sajjad voted was in 1987 when his father contested on a ticket from the Muslim United Front, which had emerged challenger to the National Conference and the Congress. His father embraced separatist politics soon after, leading to his switchover.        
	Sajjads contesting the election today appeared to have boosted the voter turnout in North Kashmirs Baramulla, where it was 40 per cent compared to 26 in Anantnag and 24 in Srinagar.        
	He is pitted against the National Conferences Sharief-ud-din Sharik and the Peoples Democratic Partys Dilawar Mir.        
	In Sopore, the home seat of Hurriyat hawk Syed Ali Shah Geelani, the turnout was only 12 per cent, in keeping with the election boycott call given by the separatists. In the last two phases in Srinagar and Anantnag too, the boycott call had played a part.

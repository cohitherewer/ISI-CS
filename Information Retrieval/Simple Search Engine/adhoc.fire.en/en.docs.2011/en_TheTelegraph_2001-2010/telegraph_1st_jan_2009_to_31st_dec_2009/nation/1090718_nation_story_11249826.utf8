The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Kanwariyas refuse brand Bihar tag
                                                                                                               Kanwariyas refuse brand Bihar tag
          GAUTAM SARKAR                              
	Kanwaria Path (Bihar), July 17: Three years ago, the Nitish Kumar government had decided to make the 110km journey of the kanwariyas to Baidyanath temple a smooth one.         
	So far, all facilities promised by the Bihar government, such as a shorter route, washrooms and food kiosks has eluded the pilgrims who undertake a rigorous walk over 110km from Sultanganj to Deoghar during the month-long Shravan mela. The 110km Kanwariya path in Bihar passing through Bhagalpur, Munger and Banka was supposed to be dotted with facilities available to pilgrims on their way to Vaishno Devi.        
	The government had planed to make kanwariyas Bihars brand ambassadors. By making their journey smoother, we wished to show the positive side of our state to the world, said PHED minister Ashwani Kumar Choubey.         
	But, the government seems to have done little for the pilgrims so far. Not a single state minister was available to inaugurate the Sultanganj fair on July 8, said Binod Shaw, a shopkeeper.         
	The new approach road for barefooted pilgrims, reduced to 17km, proved to be a difficult walk for the pilgrims.         
	We had to face ill-tempered roadside shopkeepers at Shambhuganj (Sultanganj) when we decided to take the shortcut. Since their kiosks are on the old Kanwaria path, they wanted us to take the old route, said Gopal Vikram Thapa, a pilgrim from Pokhra at Nepal.         
	Thapa who for the past 10 years has been visiting Bihar, found no change in the system. The situation was even more pathetic both at Sultanganj and at Deoghar, he alleged.        
	The new route near Dullishar under Banka is scheduled to be completed by 2010, but kanwariyas were supposed to use it from this year. Not only Bihar, but travelling on the remaining 10km in Jharkhand proved to be tedious. Drinking water, food and washrooms, there was nothing for us, a pilgrim complained.        
	Many alleged that shopkeepers were charging extra from pilgrims. We had to pay double for a battery, said Anita Devi, from UP. The standard of the food was low and expensive, complained others.         
	How can the Nitish Kumar government expect that pilgrims would accept the tag of being Bihar ambassadors? It has failed to take care of us, said another pilgrim.

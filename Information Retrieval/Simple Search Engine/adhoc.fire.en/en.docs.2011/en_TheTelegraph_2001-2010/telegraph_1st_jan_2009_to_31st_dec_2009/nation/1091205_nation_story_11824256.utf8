          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, Dec. 4: Telengana protesters today laid siege to the Andhra Assembly complex with the body of a youth who had burnt himself to death to protest Chandrasekhar Raos arrest.        
	The agitators staged a dharna with the body of Srikant Chari, the 23-year-old who died yesterday after suffering 70 per cent burns, demanding that a bill on Telengana be brought in the winter session starting December 7.        
	Chari had torched himself below an Ambedkar statue in the city after Telengana Rashtriya Samiti (TRS) chief Rao was arrested on Sunday to foil his hunger strike.        
	Four of Raos legislators today entered the Assembly building and launched a hunger strike.         
	Waving kerosene bottles, they threatened to commit suicide if the police disrupted their plans. The Assembly complex was barricaded after some of the Telengana agitators tried to storm it.         
	At Osmania University, students burnt Sonia Gandhis effigy and garlanded portraits of state ministers with footwear, dubbing them thieves of Telengana.        
	In Telengana, protesters set up roadblocks and attacked government offices.         
	Students protested the closure of hostels and shutting down of canteens because of the unrest. In Nizamabad, even children were seen in dharnas.        
	Support for the protests appeared to rise. Two MLAs of the ruling Congress, Narsa Reddy and Nandiswar Gowd, both from the Telengana region, have backed the agitation. Telugu Desam chief Chandrababu Naidu, too, offered to support any statehood bill in the House.        
	Chief minister K. Rosaiah, who returned from Delhi last night, held a meeting with ministers and MLAs from Telengana. They appealed to Rao, who is on a fast in jail, to give up his protest because of his deteriorating health.

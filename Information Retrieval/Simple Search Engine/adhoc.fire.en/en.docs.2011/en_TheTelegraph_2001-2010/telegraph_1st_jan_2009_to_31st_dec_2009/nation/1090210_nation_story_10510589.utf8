The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hizb arrest 
                                                                                                               Hizb arrest 
                            
	Srinagar, Feb. 9: Kashmir police today arrested Hizb-ul Mujahideen chief operational commander Muzaffar Dar, in a major success for forces tracking the alleged mastermind behind several explosions in the Valley.        
	State police chief B. Srinivas said Dar was arrested from Saderbal, outside the Kashmir University campus.        
	Sources said Dar was a close aid of Hizb supreme commander Syed Salahuddin, who is based in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir.        
	He has masterminded several terrorist activities and has been actively involved in financing the terrorist activities of the Hizb, Srinivas said.        
	The latest incident in which he was involved relates to the IED blast at Narbal in July 2008 in which security forces suffered casualties.        
	About a dozen troopers were killed in the July 19 attack after a bomb exploded under an army bus on the Srinagar-Uri highway.        
	Srinagar police chief Ahfad-ul-Mujtaba said Dar, 38, was the senior-most state commander of the Hizb, the largest militant group in Jammu and Kashmir.        
	 He was an IED expert and controlled almost all the major explosions that happened in the Valley, the officer added.        
	A police source said the force had been tracking Dar who had been living in a rented house for the past three months.        
	The arrest is the latest in a series of setbacks for the Hizb, which has lost several commanders in the past year.        
	Some 14 months ago, security forces had picked up the outfits then chief commander Nissar Ahmad Bhat alias Ghazi Misbah-ud-din.

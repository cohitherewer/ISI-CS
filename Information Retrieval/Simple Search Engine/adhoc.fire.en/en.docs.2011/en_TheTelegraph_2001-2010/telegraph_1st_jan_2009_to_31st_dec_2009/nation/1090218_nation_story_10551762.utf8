The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Soren war on Lalu turf
                                                                                                               Soren war on Lalu turf
          GAUTAM SARKAR                          The contenders: Guruji versus Laluji                                  
	Dumka (Jharkhand), Feb. 17: Shibu Soren, who has already declared war with Lalu Prasad, is ready to launch JMMs networking programme at Chakai block of Jamui district in Bihar from February 20.         
	Soren is scheduled to start a padayatra (march) in Chakai for the first phase of what he describes as a movement to penetrate the Lalu bastion with JMMs green brigade comprising MPs, MLAs and central committee members.         
	According to the party central organisation secretary, Suprio Bhattacharjee, the movement would be an answer to the railway ministers indifferent attitude towards Jharkhand in general and towards JMM in particular.         
	In the recently concluded JMM foundation day celebrations, held at Dhanbad on February 4, we decided to promote our candidates for the forthcoming Lok Sabha and Assembly elections in Bihar, he said.         
	The party will stand in areas where there is a sizeable tribal population. We will field 15 candidates for the Assembly polls and five for the Lok Sabha polls, there. Our aim is to challenge the RJD chief on his home turf, Bhattachrajee said.         
	The JMM, he added, is set to field candidates at Jamui, Banka, Bhagalpur, Saharsa, Purnea and Katihar, where the party enjoys a solid support base.        
	Ashok Murmu, a JMM leader from Dumka, said hundreds of activists from different parts of the Santhal Pargana would be travelling to Chakai on February 20 to attend the padayatra.         
	Central committee member Bijoy Singh concurred and added that the party will put up a tough fight for the RJS chief in areas where the JMM has solid support base.         
	Ashok Barnawal, the JMM Jamui district president, said that preparations were on to welcome Soren and other party leaders at Chakai, located 32km from Jasidih in Deoghar.        
	Incidentally, the districts of Jamui, Bhagalpur, Banka, Saharsa, Purnea and Katihar, with their sizeable tribal population, are considered to be NDA bastions, as the RJD has only two Lok Sabha seats there. So the JMM, if they succeed would pose a threat to the NDA and not to the RJD as they are hoping, an observers said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, June 26: Environment and forests minister Jairam Ramesh today announced new conditions for the grant of environment clearances and expressed his displeasure at the high rate at which projects in India have been receiving clearances.         
	Im very unhappy with the rate of acceptance  98 per cent  its an unnatural state of affairs, Ramesh said, while announcing a set of new conditions for grant of clearances that he said were aimed at bolstering transparency in environment affairs.         
	Henceforth, project proponents would have to make public the conditions under which environment clearances were given, and produce half-yearly reports for the public describing how they are complying with the conditions.         
	I would like to see a healthier rate of rejection, Ramesh told reporters.         
	Under the new stipulations for environment clearances, project proponents would also have to make public a copy of the clearance letter and detail the status of compliance of the environment clearance conditions.         
	Ramesh said his ministry would also try to speed up decisions on clearances. When he had taken over, the ministry had 730 projects awaiting clearances. The number is now down to 280.         
	The minister said he respects the judiciarys role on environment issues. Over the past decade and a half, the track record of the judiciary on environment and forests has been far superior than the executive, Ramesh said.

                                                                                                               Gopalpur handles record cargo
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 22: The Gopalpur port, which is now on its revival path, has created a record of unloading 10,100 tonnes of muriate of potash within 24 hours from US vessel MV Tenshou Maru.        
	This is all-time high discharge in any anchorage port in India, said Gopalpur Port Limited (GPL) director Charchit Mishra.        
	Kakinada port in Andhra Pradesh had earlier discharged the highest 4,600 tonnes of fertiliser within 24 hours in 2006, port sources said.         
	The sources said the vessel anchored there on February 13 afternoon and after all statutory clearances, the cargo discharge started after three hours the same day.         
	The port discharged the whole stock within a week while on February 17, the highest discharge of 10,100 tonnes of muriate of potash was recorded at the port.        
	Gopalpur seasonal port had almost turned defunct and the port operation was closed till a couple of years ago.         
	It is being revived again by the consortium headed by Orissa Stevedores Limited and being developed into an all-weather port with cargo handling capacity of 20 million tonnes per annum at an estimated cost of Rs 1,700 crore. The port is expected to be commissioned by 2012.        
	On September 14, 2006, the concession agreement was signed between the government and a consortium comprising Orissa Stevedores Limited, Sara International Limited and Hong Kong-based Noble Group Limited for the development of a state-of-the-art all-weather port on build, operate, own, share and transfer (BOOST) basis.        
	GPL had already invested to the tune of Rs 150 crore and the all-weather port would be ready by 2012, said Mishra.         
	He claimed that several shipping companies had evinced interest to send their vessels to Gopalpur after successful loading of about half-a-million tonnes of cargo till date.        
	The port has facilities to cater to the needs of coal, ileminite, steel, iron ore and agro and mineral-based industries of Orissa, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh.         
	Once operational, the port would ease the heavy congestion at Paradip and fill the gap between Visakhapatnam and Paradip, he said.        
	At the moment, we have stated anchorage port operations from lagoon jetty. Dredging of harbour basin and leading channel up to 12 metres is being carried out besides creating basic railway, power and other infrastructures so that the deep-sea anchorage port is ready by 2012, said Mishra, also one of the directors of Orissa Stevedores Limited.        
	The Orissa government had handed over the port to Gopalpur Port Limited in October 2006 and just within three months, the GPL had successfully loaded 50,000 tonnes of limonite consignment from the Union government.                           
	In 2007-08 shipping season (November-May), 18 vessels had anchored at the port, which handled 2,46,738MT of cargo.        
	In 2008-09, so far six ships have anchored and the port has handled 1,70,856MT of cargo. The port has since generated total revenue of Rs 10.62 crore during January 2006-June 30, 2008, said a GPL release.

	Baliguda (Kandhamal), April 8: AICC general secretary Rahul Gandhi today touched upon last years communal violence in the region, but did not make a focused attack on the BJP for its communal politics.        
	Addressing an election rally, Rahul said: Orissa was once a peaceful state. But of late, the communal peace and amity has been lost.         
	Without naming the former BJD-BJP combine, he said: They (non-Congress parties) have destroyed peace and communal harmony. However, the young leader remained mum on Naveen Patnaik-led governments failure to control the violence.        
	Kandhamal witnessed intense communal violence following the murders of VHP leader Swami Laxmananda Saraswati and four of his associates on the night of August 23 in a Jalespeta ashram.         
	This is the same area where a 29-year-old Catholic nun was allegedly raped and paraded naked by a mob on August 25 during the violence that followed the murders at K-Nuagaon, a few kilometres from the ashram.         
	The carnage evoked a sharp response with the Pope and European religious leaders expressing concern.         
	Prime minister Manmohan Singh had described the incident as a national shame, while the Centre asked chief minister Naveen Patnaik to rein in violence.        
	Though no incident of communal violence has been reported in the district since October, there is a palpable fear among minority communities with the election approaching. Church leaders have been demanding that the polls be delayed.        
	BJP has fielded Ashok Sahu as its candidate from the Kandhamal Lok Sabha constituency and Pramod Pradhan, accused of having a hand in the riots, from the sensitive G-Udaygiri Assembly segment.        
	Rahuls rally was held today amid tight security. Around five police platoons and central paramilitary forces were deployed at the venue, said Kandhamal superintendent of police S. Praveen Kumar.        
	Though earlier the BJP had decided to bring its poster boy and Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi to the area, they later dropped the idea.        
	Around 15,000 people, mostly tribals, attended the rally braving the scorching sun. Some seemed less afraid now. We now live in peace, said Amar Singh Mandal, 50, from Mundigarh panchayat under Tumudibandh block, where the seer was killed.        
	Sumadini Digal, 55, of Badagaon village admitted she came just to see Rahul. I have seen his father and grandmother, but never the young man, she said.         
	Some youth enthusiasts in the district Congress addressed Rahul as the prince of Congress who would be Prime Minister, while former MP Mrutyunjay Nayak described him as the future of India. Rahul, who reached 45 minutes late, highlighted the UPA governments achievements, including the NREGS, midday meal programme for schoolchildren, Forest Rights Act for ST and Rajiv Gandhi Gramin Vidyutkaran Yojana.        
	We had promised to provide a government for the common man, poor, Dalits and Adivasis. We have fulfilled our promise, he said.        
	UPA has worked for the poor and the weak sections. But, Orissa has not received the fruits, though the state is the poorest with large chunks of Dalit and Advasi populations, said Rahul.        
	 Later, he addressed another rally at Dharamgarh in Kalahandi, winding up his two-day election tour of Orissa.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                      Balakrishnan                          
	New Delhi, Aug. 28: Supreme Court judges will make their assets public once the disclosure modalities are finalised, the Chief Justice of India said today, but clarified the move isnt binding on high courts.        
	High courts are independent organisations functioning under the Constitution. The Supreme Court has no supervisory jurisdiction on the administrative side. Most high courts will take independent decisions on the matter, K.G. Balakrishnan told a news conference.         
	Late this evening, judges of Delhi and Kerala High Courts agreed to make their assets public.        
	Chief Justice Balakrishnan indicated that working out the nitty-gritty of updating the statements of assets of all apex court judges and placing it on the courts website would take a month or two.        
	The resolution has not yet been signed by all judges.         
	On Wednesday, all 23 Supreme Court judges had passed a resolution declaring they would put details of their assets on the courts website. The information was so far with the Chief Justice of India and the chief justices of high courts.        
	We have been strictly following the 1997 resolution, only not making it public. In the changed circumstances, we will publish it on the website, Balakrishnan said.         
	He laughed away suggestions the changed circumstances meant the public pressure that had forced the apex court to lift the veil.        
	The courts 1997 resolution, essentially a restatement of values of judicial life, mandates every judge to voluntarily make a declaration of assets, in the form of real estate or investments held by him or his dependents, within a reasonable time of assuming office. Acquisitions of a substantial nature also have to be disclosed.

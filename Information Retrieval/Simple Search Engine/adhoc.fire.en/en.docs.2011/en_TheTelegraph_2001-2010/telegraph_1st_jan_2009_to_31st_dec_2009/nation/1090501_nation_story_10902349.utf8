	Hyderabad, April 30: Ten Tamil refugees who fled the war in Sri Lanka were rescued off the Kakinada coast today with the help of fishermen.        
	They were part of a group of 19 who had set sail in a boat two days ago, police and coast guard officials involved in the rescue said.        
	Five of them died after being caught in a crossfire between the Lankan army and the Tamil Tigers. Four had starved to death during the voyage. Their bodies had to be dumped in the sea for fear of vultures, a survivor said.         
	The rescued 10 were questioned after being given food and treated for exhaustion and diarrhoea, the officials said. They are being kept in a relief camp.

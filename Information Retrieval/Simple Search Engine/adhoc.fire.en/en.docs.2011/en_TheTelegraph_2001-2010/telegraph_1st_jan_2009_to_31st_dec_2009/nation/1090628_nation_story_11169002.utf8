          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, June 27: The Maoists today slammed the CPMs allies for failing to pull out of the government in protest against the decision to enforce the central ban on the rebels and the joint Centre-state crackdown in Lalgarh.        
	In an open letter to parties such as the RSP, CPI and the Forward Bloc, the Maoists eastern region spokesperson, Surya, accused them of shedding crocodile tears while playing opportunistic politics and mouthing doublespeak over the ban.        
	You raised a hue and cry over Singur and Nandigram but failed to rebel against the fascist politics of the CPM and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government, Surya wrote.        
	Reacting to the charges, the CPM allies sounded apologetic. We still think of the Maoists as friends. Even when Naxalites attacked us in the 1970s, we didnt ask for a ban. But we are opposed to their wrong politics and appeal to them to come back to the democratic fold, Bloc veteran Ashok Ghosh said.

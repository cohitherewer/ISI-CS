	Mumbai, April 30: The glam brigade was there but the terror-scarred stayed away.         
	Bankers, business leaders, film stars, socialites  all part of Mumbais high-profile Page 3 crowd  came out and voted, keeping a promise they had made at the Gateway of India days after the 26/11 attacks.        
	But many of the victims and their families opted out. Colin Pinto, whose sister Cassandra and her husband were killed at the Trident hotel, did not vote. Neither did Sachin Bhulerao of Navi Mumbai whose brother Mohit was killed at the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST).        
	Whether it is terrorists, or unemployment, or price rise, or lack of proper healthcare  the system is not geared for the security or welfare of the common man. We have voted time and again  it has not changed our lot, said Ibrahim Boxwallah, who lost his uncle, aunt and cousins at the shooting in CST by Ajmal Kasab, the lone terrorist captured alive and now on trial.        
	The focus on security appears to have polarised the electorate in Mumbai South  one of Indias smallest yet financially most influential constituencies  between the haves and have-nots.        
	Nobody really cares about us. The candidates only look into the interests of the rich  so they can have their dinners in five-star hotels in peace, their families and friends do not die at the hands of terrorists. Where were their bleeding hearts when many of our friends and family members died in the Mumbai train blasts? said Sachin Waghmare, a resident of a chawl in Girgaum, close to where Kasab was caught.

	Elsewhere, in the Colaba fishermens colony, opposite the palatial homes of two of Indias richest men  Mukesh and Anil Ambani  the residents sat around enjoying a day off.        
	Many of them were among the first to spot the terrorists as they alighted from a dinghy next to their hutments.        
	It is not that people here are in a mass-boycott mode of the polls. But there is not so much excitement. There are issues other than 26/11 that affect us. But the candidates are not talking about them. They are only running after the rich, complained Rajendra Kale, a local resident.        
	But despite this apathy, Mumbai South logged a voter turnout of 43.33 per cent, nearly matching its 2004 score of 44 per cent.        
	The disinterest of the urban poor was made up for by the enthusiasm of the middle-class and the upwardly mobile, many of whom had converged at the Gateway along with the Page 3 glitterati.        
	Banker Sriram Lakshmi was, in his own words, one of the thousands of outraged Mumbaikars who had lit a candle at Gateway of India after the 26/11 attacks in a mark of solidarity with the victims and protest against the governments impotent terror policy.        
	He voted, as did 23-year-old BPO executive Sanjay Kathar who recently lost his job. Sanjay had been injured at Nariman House by grenade shrapnel while looking for his younger brother.        
	Yet that was not on top of my mind when I voted. I voted for a candidate who can represent the aspirations of young India, he said.        
	Police widows        
	Mansi Shinde, wife of inspector Shashank Shinde who died at CST, is on election duty as she is an LIC employee but decided not to vote in protest.         
	My husbands name was listed for the Ashok Chakra, but instead he was given the Kirti Chakra. He bravely fought the terrorists, but the government has not honoured his sacrifice, Shinde said.        
	But Kavita Karkare, widow of slain anti-terrorist squad chief Hemant Karkare, did vote.

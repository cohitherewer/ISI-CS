The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mamata sulks, skips House and lunch 
                                                                                                               Mamata sulks, skips House and lunch 
          OUR BUREAU                             Mamata, (below) Mukherjee                                 
	New Delhi, July 24: Mamata Banerjee went into a sulk today, staying away from Parliament, after the government overruled her objections to two land-related bills.         
	She was to answer questions related to her railway ministry in the Rajya Sabha but in Mamatas absence, her deputy K.H. Muniappa had to fill in.        
	The Trinamul leader also abstained from a lunch hosted by Pranab Mukherjee, the finance minister and the leader of the Lok Sabha, for the heads of all political parties from the UPA, those that support it from outside and the Opposition in Parliament.         
	To reinforce her protest, she did not send a single Trinamul representative to the occasion that was described by a Congress member as a goodwill meal that induced nostalgia for the Left in us.        
	Her ministers and MPs, however, attended Parliament.        
	The Mamata-government tension has put in a piquant situation one of her ministers, Sisir Adhikari, who is the deputy to C.P. Joshi in the rural development ministry that is piloting the Land Acquisition Bill and the Rehabilitation and Resettlement Bill. Trinamul sources said Adhikari was helpless.        
	Congress sources said Mamatas options were limited at this point. She is mature and will realise this. Her point is well taken because we cannot forget the fact that she kicked the Nano out of Bengal. Beyond this, we cannot do anything, a source said.        
	At yesterdays cabinet meeting, Mamata had strongly objected to the bills in their current shape. Congress sources said that, having made her point, Mamata did not threaten to take any precipitate steps like walking out of the meet.         
	Kamal Nath, the surface transport minister, tried to explain to Mamata that the state government would pay an extra amount on the 30 per cent land it would be allowed to acquire under the amendments so that on an average the seller would get more than a fair deal.         
	She was also informed that acquisition of agricultural land would be the last resort and that there was no question of buying two-crop land. Fallow land will ideally be our first and last choice, said a Congress minister. However, sources said she remained unmoved.

          RUDRA BISWAS                               
	Ranchi, Nov. 5: The enforcement directorate team probing alleged money-laundering by Madhu Koda today requisitioned more officers from Delhi, fuelling speculation that the former Jharkhand chief minister may be arrested within 48 hours.         
	Koda, charged with amassing over Rs 2,000 crore through money-laundering and illegal investments, was shifted this afternoon from the Apollo Hospitals ICU, where he had been admitted on Tuesday with nausea and stomachache, to a deluxe room at the facility.        
	Doctors said he was stable and could be discharged within the next few days.         
	The condition of the former chief minister is stable. If everything goes normally, we expect to release him in two to three days, hospital superintendent P.D. Sinha said.        
	He said enforcement directorate (ED) and income-tax officials had sought updates on Kodas condition and insisted that they be informed before he was discharged.        
	The ED team, led by deputy director Prabhat Kant, has been camping here since November 3. Yesterday, it sealed a part of Kodas official residence and served summons on him in the hospital to appear at its Delhi office on November 9.         
	On October 9, the directorate had lodged FIRs against Koda, three of his former cabinet colleagues and two aides, Binod Sinha and Sanjay Choudhury, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act for alleged misuse of their official position and fraud.         
	Since the FIRs have already been lodged, the ED is fully empowered to arrest the former chief minister in the first instance and produce him before a magistrate later, an ED source said.        
	Aides Sinha and Choudhury have till tomorrow to appear before the agencies, failing which they will be declared absconding and arrest warrants issued.        
	Today, the income-tax department sealed around 120 bank accounts belonging to aides of Koda in various cities, including Ranchi, Jamshedpur, Lucknow, Delhi and Mumbai. Income-tax sources said that during the past three years, the accounts had recorded transactions of Rs 1,500 crore.        
	HC report        
	Jharkhand High Court today directed the state government to furnish on November 12 a progress report on the vigilance probe into the assets case against Koda and his former cabinet colleagues.

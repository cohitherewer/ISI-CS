          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Vijayalakshmi. (File picture)                                  
	Hyderabad, Sept. 2: Y.S.R. Reddys wife Vijayalakshmi fainted when she was told around 11am that his chopper was reported missing.        
	The chief ministers cabinet colleague, finance minister K. Rosaiah, and Andhra Pradesh chief secretary P. Ramakanth Reddy, had brought the word to her.        
	Vijayalakshmi, 53, prayed whenever her husband stepped out home. She had done so today, too, when Reddy was leaving for Chittoor.         
	She regained consciousness a few minutes later and was helped to her feet by her children and aides. Rosaiah and Ramakanth Reddy consoled her and said everything was being done to trace Reddy.        
	Vijayalakshmi then offered prayers again  the family also worships Hindu deities though Reddy is a Christian  for his wellbeing.        
	Sources in the chief ministers home said Congress chief Sonia Gandhi called up the family, as had Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The calls came around 4pm.        
	Jaganmohan, Reddys MP son, said he had faith in god and his father was safe and would come home soon.        
	Other than Jaganmohan, Reddys daughter Sharmila and her husband Anil Kumar were at home, as were Reddys four grandsons and two granddaughters. Reddys brothers Viveknanda and Sudheer, who stay nearby in Hyderabad, also came over.        
	Phones at the chief ministers camp office  an office built within his Begumpet residence compound  didnt stop ringing. Among those called were film stars Chiranjeevi and Rajasekhar, and Opposition leaders Chandrababu Naidu and the BJPs Kishan Reddy.        
	By the evening, the chief ministers supporters, from native place Kadapa and Rayalaseema, started arriving in Hyderabad and gathering outside his home.        
	In faraway Kurnool and Mahbubnagar, over which the chopper was suspected to have disappeared, his supporters joined the villagers and search teams.        
	This isnt the first time the family and loyalists have had to spend anxious moments over Reddys safety in his 35-year-long public life.         
	In the early 80s, when Reddy was a Congress MLA, he was shot at in an attack that had been blamed on rivals in his mining business and hostile factions of the party.        
	What had saved him then was the retaliatory firing by his close aide Surido  who has now been made his additional security officer and shadows the chief minister. Surido couldnt accompany his boss today because the chopper didnt have enough room.

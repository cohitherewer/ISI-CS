The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitish slams UPA budget
                                                                                                               Nitish slams UPA budget
  - Bihar neglected          NALIN VERMA                           CM not happy anymore                                        
	Patna, Feb. 16: Criticising the interim budget presented by Pranab Mukherjee in the Lok Sabha today, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar slammed the UPA for failing to address concerns of backward states such as Bihar.         
	The budget does not offer any special economic packages to Bihar. It has allowed no concessions similar to those offered to the Northeastern states, Uttaranchal or even to Himachal Pradesh, he said.        
	The chief minister added that though the Centre seemed to pull out all its resources to bail out big companies, it seemed to have no funds for the eastern state.        
	When an all-party delegation from Bihar tried to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to talk of the special status demand made by the state, they were turned away, Nitish said. He treated todays budget as the second blow to the states well being.        
	Nitish reminded the media that after its first budget the UPA government had appreciated the need for a special package for Bihar.         
	We do not understand why it (UPA government) deliberately chose to ignore the states cause in its successive budgets, Nitish said.         
	Finally, he said that the interim budget presented today had fallen much below the peoples expectations. It is a direction-less budget that does not include any sops for Bihar.        
	The full-fledged budget will be presented after the Lok Sabha elections. By then the electorate would decide which parties get to actually present the full budget. However, I might add, that the states experience with the UPA government has been a bitter one. The economic health of the country in the past five years has deteriorated from bad to worse. The NDA government had taken positive initiatives that accounted for higher growth rate, which the UPA failed to maintain.         
	Now of course, the Indian economy is facing the pressure of a global meltdown, the chief minister said.

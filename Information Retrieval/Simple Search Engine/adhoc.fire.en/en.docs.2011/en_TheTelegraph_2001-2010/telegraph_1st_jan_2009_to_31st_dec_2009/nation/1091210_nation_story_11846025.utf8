The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lady officer quits for statehood
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Lady officer quits for statehood
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                          Nalini with her resignation letter                                   
	Hyderabad, Dec. 9: A deputy superintendent of police hailing from the Telengana region today resigned from service to protest against the use of force against students demanding a separate state, her decision being seen as the first victory for the movement during the current standoff.        
	M. Nalini, posted as deputy superintendent in Medak subdivision, said in her resignation letter that she could not work in a force that was divided along caste and religious lines. I cannot point a gun at students instead of criminals and terrorists, she said in the letter submitted to the director-general of police.        
	Nalini later told a Telugu television news channel that she resigned in protest against excesses committed by the police against students of Osmania and other universities.         
	Being a person from the region, I could not stand the oppression unleashed against students and those fighting for Telengana. Hence, I decided to quit, Nalini told the channel.        
	Nalini passed out of the Andhra Pradesh Police Academy in December 2008 and had her first posting at Medak. The mother of two is a native of Bhongir in Nalgonda, one of the 10 districts which make up the Telengana region.        
	The government sought to explain the officers resignation as a personal decision owing to poor health. Sources said the officer had been on a months leave following a surgery.         
	She submitted a letter to me but we are yet to examine its content. Being a government servant, there is a procedure for resignation. We are looking into the issue, PTI quoted director-general of police R.R. Girish Kumar as saying.         
	Soon after putting in her papers, Nalini was seen at the NIMS hospital where the fasting Telengana Rashtra Samiti chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao has been admitted since the last one week.         
	Nalini told reporters at NIMS that she faced harassment and humiliation from senior police officials belonging to non-Telengana districts. There is an attitude of indifference and untouchability in the department towards recruits from Telengana, said Nalini, who hails from a family of CPI sympathisers who had supported the Telengana campaign through the seventies.         
	Nalini said the present anti-Telengana stand of the government was prompted by several senior Andhra IPS officers who were exploiting the situation for their own political agenda.         
	Nalinis resignation follows a similar move by a police inspector on the eve of this years Lok Sabha elections. In 2005, a constable had killed himself in Nizamabad over the delay in formation of Telengana.

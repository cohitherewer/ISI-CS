          SHRADHA AGARWAL                          Sabyasachi, (right) Rahman: Dress rehearsal                                  
	Calcutta, Feb. 14: The Oscar spotlight may be on Mumbai but Calcutta has stolen its moment.        
	City fashion designer Sabyasachi Mukherjee has made an outfit for A.R. Rahman and two for his wife Saira for the Academy Awards at the Kodak Theater in Hollywood.        
	I am the only Indian designer who has made clothes for A.R. Rahman for the occasion. I have designed a sherwani for him and two ethnic ensembles for his wife for the big Oscar weekend, Sabyasachi told The Telegraph.        
	All three outfits are from the designers Bridal Sutra collection. For the music composer  nominated for best original score and best original song for Slumdog Millionaire  it is a black sherwani to be worn with a black kurta and a white Aligarhi.        
	Sairas wardrobe includes one of Sabyasachis signature body-con style kurtas and a long-yoke zardozi kurta. Both outfits come with dupattas and churidaars. Saira dresses traditionally and she didnt want to change her style just because it was the Oscar red carpet, Sabyasachi said.         
	He chose a colour palette of emerald, red and black and Saira is likely to dress up her attire with vintage jewellery.         
	Vijayeta Kumar, the stylist for the Rahmans, said they had three or four options for the Oscar ceremony and events.         
	No one knows what they will wear till the morning of February 22. It is always advisable to carry options. Emergencies can come up, like a stuck zipper or a missing button. Also, when international travel is involved, we need to take precautions.         
	And why Sabyasachi? Because he is the best, Vijayeta said.

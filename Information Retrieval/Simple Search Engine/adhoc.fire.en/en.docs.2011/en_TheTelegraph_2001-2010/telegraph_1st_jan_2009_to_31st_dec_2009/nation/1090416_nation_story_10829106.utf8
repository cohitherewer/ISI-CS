The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Actress strikes Andhra chord 
                                                                                                               Actress strikes Andhra chord 
  - Drama in poll debut          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA IN MEDAK                        Actress Vijayashanti campaigns in Medak. Picture by G. Vijayalakshmi				                                       
	For Lady Amitabh, the elections are an extension of the silver screen  theatrical, melodramatic, replete with tough words and witty one-liners.         
	Vijayashanti, a staunch votary for a separate Telengana state, is not pulling any punches as she hits the final lap of her campaign for Medak, 100km northeast of Hyderabad. The actress is making her poll debut on a ticket from the Telengana Rastra Samiti (TRS).        
	You have seen me as a star, as a saviour of the poor. You know Ramulamma, dont you, the 42-year-old Telugu superstar says in her meetings, as she identifies herself with one of her most famous characters from Dasari Narayan Raos 1997 blockbuster Osey Ramulamma.         
	Now you see me in real life ready to do similar things and more, she says amid thunderous applause. Thithi chesta (I will ensure your end), the actress signs off with a famous dialogue mouthed by Ramulamma, now aimed at the Congress.         
	The star of some 175 films is no novice to politics, having earlier campaigned for former central minister Ch. Vidyasagar Rao of the BJP and having worked as the vice-president of the BJPs womens cell.         
	Vijayashanti resigned from the BJP in a huff after L.K. Advani refused her a Rajya Sabha nomination and floated her own outfit, Telengana Talli, in 2005, hogging the limelight with her protest before a childrens hospital during the doctors strike.         
	But with the party not really taking off, she merged it with the TRS and insisted on the Medak seat, considered safe because of the extreme pro-Telengana sentiments here.         
	In contrast, her chief opponent, C. Narendranath of the Congress, a real estate businessman also making his electoral debut, is hardly known in the constituency and is also no match for the actress glamour  and oratorical  quotient.         
	Her rallies, held early morning or late in the evening, are preceded by screenings of her popular films, ensuring a large crowd.        
	Backed by the Telugu Desam and the Left parties and with the Congress putting up a weak candidate, Vijayashanti appears to be sitting pretty. Chiranjeevis Praja Rajyam has hardly any presence in Medak.        
	Her rallies are an extension of the screen entertainment she provided as the angry young woman, an image that earned her the sobriquet equating her with Big B.         
	Vijayashanti strikes a chord with local sentiments by carrying decorated earthen pots on her head and singing devotional songs like the women celebrating the Telengana festival of Bonalu.   
	Medak goes to polls today

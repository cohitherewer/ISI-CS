                                                                                                               Jairam push for green monitor
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, June 5: India plans to create an autonomous agency called the Environment Protection Authority to build a science-driven policing and regulatory system, Jairam Ramesh said today.         
	The EPA, to be established by law, will be empowered to maintain standards and regulations relating to the environment, he said at an event attended by corporate leaders.         
	In a message that appeared directed to industry, the environment minister said his ministry should not be viewed as a hurdle to economic growth and that it was only implementing the laws of the land.         
	He said environmental impact assessment  a mandatory process that precedes the launch of industrial projects  was not anti-industry. But the process was not fulfilling its obligations.         
	The free ride on the environment is over, Ramesh said. India will have an empowered, professionally-staffed and fully-funded EPA to monitor compliance, he said.         
	The minister cited the stark contrasts between the regulatory systems in the US and India. The US Environmental Protection Agency has a staff of 18,000 and an annual budget of $7 billion (Rs 329 billion). Indias Central Pollution Control Board, the agency currently responsible for monitoring the environment and tracking compliance, has only 150 people and an annual budget of Rs 400 million.This (EPA) has been mooted in the past, but no one has pushed it through, said Rajendra Pachauri, director-general of The Energy and Resources Institute, New Delhi. We need a new agency equipped and staffed differently.        
	Ramesh said industry should expect a new transparent regulatory system.         
	Within the next two months, we would like to change from a non-transparent and bureaucratic system to a transparent and science-based environmental regulatory system, he said.

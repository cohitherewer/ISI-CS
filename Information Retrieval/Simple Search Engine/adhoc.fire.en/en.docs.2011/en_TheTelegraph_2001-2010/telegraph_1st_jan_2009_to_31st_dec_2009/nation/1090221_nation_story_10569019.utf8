          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bangalore, Feb. 20: Cricket fans watching Indian Premier League games in Bangalore may have to cough up more in Season II, which begins in April.        
	Karnataka chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa today announced in his budget an entertainment tax at the rate of 10 per cent of the entry ticket value for sports events organised for entertainment involving private proprietary teams.        
	Till two years ago, Karnataka imposed a tax on all sports events involving the sale of tickets, a government official said.        
	Bengal and Maharashtra too levy an entertainment tax that applies to IPL matches. However, since Maharashtra granted an exemption on entertainment tax last season, the Kolkata Knight Riders ended up being the only franchise that paid tax on the games.

  - Advani asks back-stage brains to jump into fray; Sonia to take call on tie-up with Mulayam      Sanjay K. Jha                                    Jaitley, Swaraj, Naidu: Multi-tasking                                      
	New Delhi, Jan. 30: The BJPs ace poll strategists will now have to prove they can fight an election as well as manage one.        
	Arun Jaitley, Venkaiah Naidu and Sushma Swaraj, busy for the past six months plotting strategy, picking candidates, eyeing alliances and priming the organisation for the general election, have just been advised to contest.        
	Earlier, the party had said they would only manage the polls, not fight them. But discouraging internal surveys about the partys prospects prompted prime ministerial candidate L.K. Advani to call all his generals to battle.        
	Jaitley, hailed for crafting the BJPs win in several states, has never contested an election except as a student.         
	Venkaiah won Assembly elections thrice but then switched to national politics instead of struggling in Andhra Pradesh where the BJP doesnt have much of a presence. He has never contested a Lok Sabha election and is Karnatakas nominee in the Rajya Sabha.         
	Sushma won Assembly elections from Haryana twice and was a popular minister there, but then shifted to Delhi. She won the Lok Sabha election from South Delhi twice and even became chief minister briefly, but didnt want to be limited to state politics. Her roots in Delhi were weakened when she was sent to Bellary to fight Sonia Gandhi, and then became a Rajya Sabha member, from Uttarakhand in 2002 and from Madhya Pradesh in 2006.        
	But Advani thinks the presence of powerful personalities can make a big difference in a tight election.         
	Reluctant initially, the managers now appear to have begun to seriously explore the possibility of contesting the election that is round the corner.         
	While Advani might have pushed them to bolster the NDAs prospects, there is a feeling the post-poll internal dynamics of the BJP is the primary reason the leaders have agreed to contest. If the BJP comes to power, top leaders who win the election will carry more weight than their Rajya Sabha counterparts. If the party loses, there could still be a race for party president and leader of the Opposition.        
	Rajnath Singh and Murli Manohar Joshi have already entered the fray. Sushma, Jaitley and Venkaiah are the other three leaders who can stake claim to top posts and they need to position themselves for that.         
	Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modis phenomenal rise has made the mass leader tag even more valuable in the BJP.         
	Winning an election is a must to stay in the competition against Modi. So, the trio who do not have a support base in their native states are on the hunt for safe seats elsewhere.         
	Jaitley is evaluating his chances from Delhi, Punjab, Gujarat and Jammu and Kashmir.        
	The hunt for a safe seat has taken Sushma to Madhya Pradesh, where her name is being considered from Bhopal.        
	Venkaiah is all dressed up with nowhere to go, except Nellore in his home state. But unlike Sushma who is confident and Jaitley, who is expectant, Venkaiah knows his verbal jugglery alone will not be enough to see him through.         
	He can, of course, choose to opt out and go back to playing poll manager alone.

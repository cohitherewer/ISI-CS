          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Cops to stalk red moves                                  
	Patna, April 17: Determined to provide their voters adequate security, Rohtass election machinery conducted polls at only three booths (out of nine) in Dhansa valley yesterday with maximum security present at the time of election.        
	The remaining six booths are slated to go to polls on April 19, a decision that was taken by the district poll machinery, headed by district magistrate Shravan M.         
	A request letter to his effect was forwarded to principal home secretary Afzal Amanullah who in turn forwarded it to the Election Commission.         
	Dhansa valley has as many as nine stations that are said to fall under the liberated zone of the CPI(Maoist) and have not witnessed polling in the past 20 years, with Maoists setting up their own police, executive and judicial system there.        
	This is the same place where on April 15 red guerrillas shot rocket launchers at a school and demolished it, beginning a four-hour gun battle with a BSF camp that was being put up there. The encounter killed 10 rebels and forced the Maoists to retreat to the surrounding forests.        
	The state poll authorities believe that April 19  a poll-free day in the rest of the country  will be an ideal date as extra forces would be readily available. They are also hopeful that the election commission approve of their decision which should arrive in the district by tomorrow morning.        
	Yesterday, Rohtas administration had deployed 130 companies of central paramilitary forces in the state that saw polls in most of its red zones yesterday. But, the officials felt that the Centre should have supplied at least 260 companies of the paramilitary forces.        
	Contrary to the perception that the politically conscious Bihar, where 46 per cent of its electorate cast their votes, saw a relatively low percentage of votes being cast (as against Kerala and Nagaland) authorities here are satisfied with the turnout.        
	Nagaland is thinly populated and even if eight out of its 10 people cast their votes, the record shows as 80 per cent. On the other hand, Bihars constituencies have 13 to 15 lakh voters and given the concentration of the population 46 per cent voting is quite satisfactory, said a senior official.        
	He added that ongoing harvest and wedding seasons may have stopped voters from joining in the process, along with the Maoist threat.        
	Yesterday, Rohtas administration selected only three booths, out of nine, to conduct elections. Each booth had a police platoon (comprising 16 jawans) manning it, said principal home secretary Afzal Amanullah. People turned up to vote after almost 20 years.         
	These three booths in Dhansa valley of Sasaram Lok Sabha constituency recorded 50 per cent of votes against Bihars total poll percentage of 46 in the first phase of polling.        
	Union minister and Congress nominee Meera Kumar is contesting to retain the seat from Rohtas.        
	Yesterdays enthusiastic turnout proved that the people still have faith in the democratic process, the home secretary said, adding: The administration has apprised the commission about its strategy of conducting phase-wise polls in Dhansa valley and has asked permission to conduct the second phase polls on April 19.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP wrestles with music
                                                                                                               BJP wrestles with music
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 1: Whether they win or lose, you arent likely to catch BJP leaders in Haryana saying Mamma Mia!        
	Not after they asked for a ban on western music in their manifesto for the October 13 elections.        
	Reason: western music is vulgar.        
	Nobody in the central BJP could, however, tell who the partys Haryana leaders had in mind: Mozart or Chopin, rock bands Red Hot Chili Peppers and Led Zeppelin, or The Beatles or pop-music group ABBA, the creator of the hit song Mamma Mia.        
	Asked by reporters in Chandigarh if he had any clue, party veteran Arun Jaitley pointed to Haryana BJP chief Krishan Pal Gujjar.        
	Jaitley also wouldnt say whether he liked western music. You are entitled to presume what you like, he said.        
	The Haryana leaders are, however, sweeping in their dislike. For them, western music is bhondapan  obscene and undesirable. So the manifesto, released yesterday, speaks of encouraging ancient Haryanvi culture, its festivals, sports and melas as a countervail against the obscenity on display (in the West) in the name of culture.        
	Realising that the ban call went against the contemporary image the BJP is trying to project, spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad today clarified that his party was not against western music. But the vulgarity is to be debunked, he said.        
	Another BJP leader said: Why make a song and dance about it when everyone knows we dont have any hope of winning?        
	But the Haryana leaders are determined to remain chaste even in defeat. State manifestos are usually written under the advice and guidance of central leaders, and sources said the draft did not mention the ban  it was sneaked in at the last minute under pressure from local leaders.        
	Haryana, though, isnt the sole cause of discomfiture for the BJP. In Maharashtra, where it signed a joint manifesto with the Shiv Sena, sources said the BJP could do nothing about two Sena-crafted promises: work permits for migrants to do away with illegal encroachers and 80 per cent jobs for sons of the soil.        
	While the sources said the second promise not only covered Marathi-speaking domiciles but also those from other states, the first was a sure way of ensuring that the huge migrant votes went to the Congress-NCP.        
	Mamma Mia!

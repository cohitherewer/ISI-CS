          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, March 20: Mohan Bhagwat will take over as RSS chief from K. Sudarshan tomorrow.         
	Sources say the transition will take place at the annual general meeting in Nagpur.         
	Mohan, at present the number two in the outfit, is seen as a tough leader. Sangh leaders say the RSS will be seen in its true form under him.         
	He is ideologically committed but also known for taking a pragmatic approach on contemporary issues. The RSS used to name new chiefs after the incumbents death but this changed after Rajju Bhaiyya. Sources said Bhaiyya Joshi will now be the number two.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Andhra rules out haste on Maytas
                                                                                                               Andhra rules out haste on Maytas
                            
	Hyderabad, Jan. 18 (PTI): The Andhra Pradesh government today said it would not cancel in haste projects awarded to Maytas Infra, promoted by Satyam founder B. Ramalinga Rajus family, and ruled out a probe.        
	Finance minister K. Rosaiah told a news conference: We shall not act in haste. The governments duty is to wait and see. If any of the projects are revoked, the government will have to pay a heavy penalty.        
	The CID took custody of Ramalinga Raju, his brother and former Satyam MD Rama Raju and former CFO Vadlamani Srinivas at 11.45am today. A five-member CID team, led by investigation officer N. Balaji Rao, interrogated them at the CID office. The three had been in judicial custody since January 10 after Raju confessed to the biggest financial fraud in the country.         
	 Rosaiah said there was no necessity for a probe into the Maytas projects. In a detailed note, he said that of a total of Rs 79,418 crore worth of irrigation works, projects worth Rs 5,439 crore were awarded to Maytas and its joint venture partners.        
	All the projects have been awarded in the most transparent manner, following due procedures, said Rosaiah.        
	The government could cancel the agreement with the Maytas-led consortium on the Rs 12,132-crore Hyderabad Metro Rail Project only if the company failed to achieve financial closure by March this year, as stipulated.         
	The same held for the Rs 1,255-crore Machilipatnam Deep Water Port project, for which too the Maytas-led consortium is required to achieve financial closure by March.        
	Satyam land        
	A 50-acre plot allotted to Satyam Computers for an IT park at Kapuluppada village near Visakhapatnam is being handed over to the Indian Navy.        
	The land was allotted three years ago on a request from Satyam. It was not officially handed over, but the company allegedly built a fence and claimed ownership.        
	After the Satyam scandal broke, Visakhapatnam district collector Sanjay Kumar wrote that the land was required for use by the navy. The government accepted the proposal. Since Satyam was not given possession of the land, the allotment order would be cancelled, Rosaiah said.

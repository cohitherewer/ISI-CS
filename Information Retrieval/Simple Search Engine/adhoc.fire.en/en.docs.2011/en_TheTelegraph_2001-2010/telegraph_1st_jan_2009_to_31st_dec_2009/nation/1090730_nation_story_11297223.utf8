	Cuttack, July 29: Orissa government will soon launch a School Health Programme (SHP) to address health, education, environment and nutrition issues under a comprehensive framework.        
	The SHP will be introduced under National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) that has been working in Orissa since June 2005. Modalities such as utilisation of strategies of prevention, promotion, detection and treatment of problems with health services at primary, secondary and tertiary levels were being worked out in all districts, said health department officials.         
	The Centre had launched the SHP in 2007-08 giving states the option to restructure the programme according to its suitability.         
	Besides, states were expected to formulate State School Health Policy in a manner that all stakeholders, and health and education departments in particular, have an ownership. Preparation of a set of guidelines is underway. With completion of the process the SHP would be launched in districts from August 15, said a NHRM official. Sources said Centre had allocated Rs 6.48 crore to Orissa for implementation of the programme in 2009-10.         
	To sensitise schools, the Board of Secondary Education is also expected to come up with manuals dealing with body, food and nutrition, personal and environmental hygiene, physical fitness, responsibility, safety and behavioural skills.

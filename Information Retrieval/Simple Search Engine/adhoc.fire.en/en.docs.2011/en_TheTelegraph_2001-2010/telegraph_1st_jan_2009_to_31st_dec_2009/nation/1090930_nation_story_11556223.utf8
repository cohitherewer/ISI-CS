          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Srinagar, Sept. 29: A young Kashmiri cowering under a cot as two militants assaulted her parents shook off her terror, crawled out and with her teenaged brother fought the armed Lashkar rebels before killing one with his own rifle.        
	Sources said the man Rukhsana killed was believed to be Abu Osama, a leader of the banned outfit, and the courage she showed could get the 21-year-old, Class X pass-out a gallantry award.        
	The other militant, injured after Rukhsana and her brother Aijaz charged at them with an axe, jumped out of a window and fled.        
	Police said the Lashkar militants had barged into their house on Sunday in Upper Kalsi, some 45km from Rajouri town in Jammu, and started assaulting Noor Hussain and his wife Rashida. Seeing their parents being beaten up, Rukhsana and Aijaz (A Class XII student) first hit one of the militants with an axe, snatched his gun and fired at him, killing him on the spot, Rajouri police chief Shafkat Watali said.        
	The other militant was also beaten up. He dropped his gun and jumped out the window.        
	Police sources said the militants suspected the family of working as informers. They knocked on their door but they refused to open. They (the militants) then went to the house of Noor Hussains brother Waqalat and asked him to accompany them to his brothers house, a source said. When Noor again didnt open the door, the militants smashed their way in.        
	Rukhsana said she hid under the cot when the militants broke open the door. Then I came out and hit one of them with an axe and his gun fell down. We snatched the gun and fired from it.        
	It was, however, not immediately clear who killed the militant. Since there were two AK 47 rifles in the room, both brother and sister opened fire. Who was instrumental in killing the militant is being investigated, a police official said.        
	But sources said the Jammu and Kashmir government was likely to recommend a gallantry award for Rukhsana.        
	Governor N.N. Vohra has asked for a formal report from the director-general of police so that he can recommend the girl for a gallantry award. The governor also intends to honour her at Raj Bhavan, an official spokesman said.        
	Rajouri police chief Watali said the family could be awarded the Rs 3 lakh the slain militant was carrying on his head. That will, however, happen once his identity as Osama is established.        
	3 jawans killed        
	Pistol-carrying youths shot dead three CRPF personnel in the north Kashmir town of Sopore.        
	CRPF spokesman Prabhakar Tripathi told reporters the militants surfaced at the bus stand in Sopore, 50km from Srinagar, around 5.15pm.         
	The militants came from behind and shot the three in their heads, killing them on the spot, Tripathi said.        
	One woman was injured and she has been referred to the Sher-e-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences at Srinagar for treatment.

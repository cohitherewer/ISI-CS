The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Crorepatis line up for contest
                                                                                                               Crorepatis line up for contest
          GAJINDER SINGH                              
	Chandigarh, Oct. 4: The Congress seems to believe the key to the common mans heart is held by moneybags  72 of its 90 candidates in Haryana are crorepatis.        
	If the Congresss crorepati collection looks impressive, its rivals are not exactly paisaless paupers. Over half the contestants for the October 13 Assembly polls from mainline political parties have declared assets of over Rs 1 crore, marking a growth from less than a fifth in 2005.        
	The survey was conducted by National Election Watch and Association for Democratic Reforms, a conglomeration of 1,200 NGOs. It was based on affidavits submitted to the Election Commission by the 489 candidates from mainstream political parties, including the Congress, BJP, Indian National Lok Dal, BSP, Samajwadi Party and the Haryana Janhit Congress.        
	Recent reports have suggested that Rahul Gandhi had a hand in selecting the Haryana candidates. While cash hoards might not have been a criterion for picking them, the 72 out of 90 score sits uncomfortably with spending nights in Dalit houses and even eating their food.        
	The queue of crorepati candidates could also raise a politically correct eyebrow or two in Congresss Delhi headquarters.        
	According to the survey, 31 Congress legislators in the outgoing Assembly who are contesting again have seen their assets multiply by 52 per cent to a breathtaking 55times.        
	Sharda Rathore from Ballabgarh had declared assets worth Rs 81,663 before the 2005 Assembly polls, which have now swollen to Rs 45 lakh.        
	Either understated her wealth in 2005, something that no politician is expected to do, or she has the key to Aladins cave if not to the aam aadmis heart.         
	At 55 times, Sharda Rathore, a lawyer who runs an NGO, has outperformed the Bombay Stock Exchange sensitive index, which has merely doubled in the period. It might have helped the economist in Manmohan Singh to know how some people  his own party people  are making such money in a downturn.         
	While the Congress heads the list with average assets per candidate of over Rs 5.59 crore in 90 constituencies, the INLD comes second with Rs 3.42 crore, followed by the Haryana Janhit Congress with Rs 3.03 crore, the BJP with Rs 2.23 crore and the BSP with Rs 2.03 crore.

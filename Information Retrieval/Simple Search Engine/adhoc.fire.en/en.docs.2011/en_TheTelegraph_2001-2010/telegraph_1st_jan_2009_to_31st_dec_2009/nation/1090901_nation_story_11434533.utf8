The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sibal weaves consensus
                                                                                                               Sibal weaves consensus
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 31: As ministers from state after state asked the Centre for greater funding, for an IIT or an IIM or polytechnics in a particular district, human resource development minister Kapil Sibal held up his hand to interrupt.         
	Please. Ask not what we can do for you. Ask what you can do for yourself. Let me assure you, that you alone will benefit from the returns of whatever you invest in your state. We dont want to share that, he smiled.         
	This is not about you or me. This is about us, he added.         
	Armed with JFK-style oratory and lawyer-like arguments, Sibal today overcame his biggest political test to date as HRD minister, successfully steering state governments of all shades towards a broad consensus on education reforms.        
	The Central Advisory Board of Education (Cabe), the apex education advisory body consisting of all state education ministers, independent educationists and key central ministers, today stamped its approval on the need for key reforms.         
	Sudarshan Ray Chaudhury, Bengals higher education minister, was the loudest among those who opposed some among the higher education reforms that Sibal has proposed.         
	But by assuring that his concerns would be addressed, Sibal managed to hush even Chaudhury and emerged from the Cabe meeting with a resolution.        
	Te resolution  approved by all Cabe members, including ministers from states ruled by the Left and the BJP  means that Sibal can now claim he has the countrys political mandate to introduce his reforms.         
	 As states raised concerns about their inability to shell out much funds for implementing the right to education bill, Sibal played an understanding patron and a firm boss to pluck any sting from their arguments.         
	Chaudhury told Cabe that Bengal was opposed to outsourcing the task of accrediting higher education institutions to private agencies, as is suggested under a plan for an independent accreditation regulatory body.         
	Sibal said the plan to allow private accrediting bodies in higher education could be reconsidered, but managed to obtain Chaudhurys support on the need for an independent accreditation regulation body.         
	In response to other queries from Chaudhury, Sibal clarified that the proposed national commission for higher education and research  an overarching higher education regulator  would segregate policy-making and regulation.         
	Members of the commission will only outline a regulatory policy for different streams of higher education.         
	The commission will have arms  each empowered to regulate a specific sector of higher education such as universities, technical education, teacher education or distance education.        
	Partha De, Bengals school education minister, and his counterparts from several other states expressed concern that they may not be able to significantly contribute financially to the implementation of the right to education bill.         
	Sibal assured them that the Centre would approach the Planning Commission for more funds for states unable to provide their share of the finances.         
	The HRD minister also managed to convince states on the need to make the Class X Central Board for Secondary Education examination optional.         
	Cabe approved plans to start a central madarsa board to regulate standards of non-theological teaching at Islamic seminaries.         
	The advisory panel cleared proposed laws against educational malpractices  misleading claims by institutes and capitation fees  and the creation of tribunals to resolve disputes between teachers or students and institute managements.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Samjhauta passengers, BSF hear gunfire
                                                                                                               Samjhauta passengers, BSF hear gunfire
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chandigarh, March 30: The gunfire and explosions at the police academy, just 10km from the border, was heard by many Samjhauta Express passengers and BSF personnel at Attari.        
	We did hear some sounds, but they seemed far away. The train did not stop midway to allow us to enquire, said one of the 238 passengers who arrived at Attari from Lahore around 2pm. Most of the passengers said they had dismissed the gunfire as shooting training by police.        
	Iqbal, a passenger, said he had heard about the terror attack while waiting at Lahore station but was not too worried. The rail tracks are not close to the academy, he said.        
	The train carried less than half the passengers it usually does. The Delhi-Lahore bus, late by over an hour like the Samjhauta, was diverted from Wagah through an alternative route. The bus from Lahore to Delhi had crossed over before the attack.        
	Cross-border trade, however, continued.        
	A BSF officer said over the phone from Attari: The moment we were informed of the attack, we moved a few more columns near the checkpost.        
	Pakistan Rangers personnel were among the first to be called from Wagah to engage the terrorists at the police academy, and Indian authorities were informed of the pullout by some Rangers columns.        
	The authorities initially thought of cancelling the Retreat ceremony, witnessed by thousands from both sides, but the Rangers promised foolproof security. The BSF beefed up security on the Indian side and decided to go ahead with the Retreat.        
	Theres always a danger of terrorist infiltration, the BSF officer said. Every movement on the other side will be monitored closely during the ceremony for some time now.

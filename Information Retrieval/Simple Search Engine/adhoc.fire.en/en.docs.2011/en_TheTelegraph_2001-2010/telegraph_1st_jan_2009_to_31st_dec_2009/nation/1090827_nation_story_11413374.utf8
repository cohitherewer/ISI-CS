The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tree case against concrete 
                                                                                                               Tree case against concrete 
                              Uprooted trees on a pavement in Bengal after Aila struck in May                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 26 (Agencies): Delhi High Court today sought a response from the Centre and the Delhi government on a PIL seeking a directive to de-concretise pavements in the capital to protect trees.        
	Advocate Sugriv Dubey told a bench headed by Chief Justice A.P. Shah that trees were not getting enough water and nutrition because of cementation of the area around the roots.         
	Referring to the August 21 storm in the capital when several trees were uprooted, causing heavy traffic jams, Dubey, who filed the petition, said the roots were getting weakened because of the concrete.         
	The roots of trees are being weakened by the rampant concretisation of pavements in the capital, and the concrete has to be removed for the protection of trees, Dubey said.        
	In Calcutta, too, hundreds of kerbside trees were uprooted when Cyclone Aila struck in May.        
	The court, after hearing his contention, issued a notice to the Centre and the Delhi government and asked them to file a reply on steps taken to protect trees.

                                                                                                               RSS flak for BJP minority policy
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT       
	Patna, Oct. 11: The RSS condemned the Nitish Kumar-led JD(U)-BJP government for appeasing the minorities at its three-day working committee meeting that concluded today at Rajgir in Nalanda, 100km from here.         
	The RSS is opposed to this governments policy, said the right-wing outfits general secretary, Mohan Joshi, adding: The RSS is also opposed to the governments move to open a branch of Aligarh Muslim University in Kishenganj.         
	We consider the step an unhealthy trend, he added.         
	Asked if the mother outfit of the Sangh Parivar would ask BJP, its political wing, to intervene in halting the Bihar governments alleged appeasement policy, Joshi said: The RSS may give its suggestion to any political party. But the party has the discretion to implement it. We do not interfere with the decision-making process parties.        
	The RSS also accepted a resolution to move out in the villages and launch a movement to protect jal, jungle, zameen and gai.         
	RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat yesterday addressed a section of the states senior BJP leaders, comprising deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi and party chief Radhamohan Singh asking them to step up Sangh Parivars contact with the masses.

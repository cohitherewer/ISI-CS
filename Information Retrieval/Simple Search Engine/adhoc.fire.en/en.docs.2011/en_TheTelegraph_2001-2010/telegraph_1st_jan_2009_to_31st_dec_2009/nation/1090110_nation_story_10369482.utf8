          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Guwahati, Jan. 9: A powerful IED planted in a bicycle exploded close to the Northeast Frontier Railway headquarters at Maligaon this evening, leaving a railway employee dead.        
	The blast came hours after the arrest of five Ulfa collaborators in the city and barely minutes after a tough-talking Assam government announced it would follow a zero tolerance policy against militants and terrorists.        
	The bicycle bomb was parked between a Santro and a WagonR at the Shuttle gate market near Bishnu Rabha Parkat, about 100 metres from the railway headquarters.        
	The area, teeming with shoppers, was splattered with blood and littered with shards of glass after the 6.30pm explosion. The site is not too far from Kamakhya Gate and is around 17km from Dispur.        
	City police spokesperson Jayshree Khersa confirmed the death of railway employee Dhiren Kumar Kakoty, 41, but added that the toll may go up. S. Hajong, the railways chief PRO, said the victim was a traffic inspector (safety). He added that the eight injured included six railway employees, two of them women. The condition of three was said to be critical.        
	G.P. Singh, the inspector-general of police (central western range), confirmed that it was Ulfas handiwork. It is the same group which sneaked into the city a few days before New Year to carry out strikes.        
	Harish Tiwari, a shopkeeper, said there was a deafening sound and the entire area shook under the impact of the blast. Had the two vehicles not taken the impact of the blast, there would have been more casualties.         
	Haldhar Talukdar, a railway employee, said every evening security personnel checked the particular area. But there were no securitymen today.         
	A police official at the blast site said the bicycle was parked not more than 10 minutes before the bomb exploded. He (the militant) selected a place where he could hide the cycle between two vehicles so that it would not be noticed easily.        
	The blast comes a day after Pranjal Deka, the main suspect of the January 1 serial blasts in Guwahati, was killed in an encounter at Rangia.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitish flak for BJP manifesto
                                                                                                               Nitish flak for BJP manifesto
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, April 3: The BJPs manifesto  stressing on building the Ram temple at Ayodhya, striking out Article 370 from the Constitution and implementing uniform civil code  has once against embarrassed JD(U) leader Nitish Kumar, a star NDA campaigner in Bihar and the saffron partys 13-year-old ally.        
	Sharply reacting on the poll document, the Bihar chief minister said: The JD(U) will bring out its own manifesto. The JD(U) does not agree to the BJPs view on Ram temple, Article 370 and uniform civil code.        
	Nitish clarified that the JD(U) would not allow the BJP to implement the clauses of its manifesto if the NDA came to power for the JD(U) has a view opposed to the BJP on these three issues.        
	He pointed out that his party had all along been stating that the Ayodhya issue should be solved either by the dialogue between the two communities concerned or by the court.         
	There is no third way the JD(U) can allow on the issue. We are opposed to striking Article 370 and imposing uniform civil code on people.        
	The NDA, with A.B. Vajpayee at its helm, had been brining out a common manifesto free from the reference of the three contentious issues for the past 11 years. However, the BJP  bringing its own manifesto stressing Hindutva  has apparently annoyed the JD(U) ahead of the Lok Sabha elections.        
	The JD(U) strategists feel that by bringing out a separate manifesto, the BJP itself has given a message of disunity in the NDA which the rivals might exploit to the hilt, alienating the minorities further.        
	MP jolt to RJD        
	RJD national general secretary and sitting MP from Barh, Vijay Krishna, and former RJD MP from Jehanabad, Ganesh Prasad Singh, today quit the party and joined the JD(U) in presence of Nitish.        
	Incidentally, Krishna had defeated Nitish in Barh in 2004. But Barh has lost its existence in delimitation and the RJD had refused to field him from other constituency of his choice.         
	Both Krishna and Singh described the autocratic style of Lalu Prasad as the reason for quitting the RJD.

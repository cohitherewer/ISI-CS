          BISWAJIT ROY                              
	Calcutta, May 16: Bengal CPM secretary Biman Bose today called the Left Fronts poll debacle unexpected but re- fused to identify the reasons behind it except admitting a pro-Congress wave across the country.         
	We didnt realise there was a wave in favour of the Congress. Such a wave didnt work in Bengal even after the death of Indira Gandhi. It seems people chose the Congress because of the stability factor, he said.         
	Bose parried questions on the impact of the Mamata Banerjee-led Opposition alliance and the Singur-Nandigram factors.         
	We are accepting the peoples verdict and will take corrective measures after reviewing the reasons for our defeat in the majority seats of Bengal, he said.         
	Wed try to regain the trust and faith of all sections of the state, he added, indicating the CPMs admission of a huge erosion in its traditional rural base, particularly among Muslims and backward castes, and alienation among a section of urban voters post-Nandigram.        
	Bose did not comment on whether the partys mighty organisational machine failed to fathom the extent of popular discontent against the Left.         
	Many of the leaders huddled at the state party headquarters through the day pointed out that the partys withdrawal of support to the UPA government over the Indo-US nuclear deal had facili- tated the Congress-Trinamul alliance.         
	The party mandarins, though, were not ready to concede even 16 seats to the Opposition, till the trend became clear this morning.        
	Bose and other party leaders hesitated to factor in the impact of Singur and Nandigram, farmers fears of forcible land acquisition in general as well as minority discontent.         
	It was left to Mohammed Salim, who did not expect defeat at Calcutta North, to admit that something went wrong somewhere.         
	Both Singur and Nandigram as well as the Sachar report minority mood have gone against us, Salim said.

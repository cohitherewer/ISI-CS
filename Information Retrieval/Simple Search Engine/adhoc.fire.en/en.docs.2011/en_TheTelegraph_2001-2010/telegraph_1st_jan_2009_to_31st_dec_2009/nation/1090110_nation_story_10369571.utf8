The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rice too busy to meet PC, Washington trip off 
                                                                                                               Rice too busy to meet PC, Washington trip off 
          K.P. NAYAR                               
	Washington, Jan. 9: Union home minister P. Chidambaram cancelled his visit to Washington this weekend after the Americans explicitly told India that US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice would not be available to meet him, state department officials told The Telegraph last night.        
	But even without a high profile visit by Chidambaram on the eve, as it were, of a change in administration here, the outlines of a South Asia policy in the Barack Obama White House and the Hillary Clinton state department are taking shape.        
	Pakistans president Asif Ali Zardari will be among the first half-a-dozen or so foreign heads of state and government to be received by Obama within days of his swearing-in as US President.        
	The Americans hope to extract an assurance from Zardari during his visit that Pakistan will hand over at least one or two persons wanted by India from among its list of 20 terrorists as a token of Islamabads commitment to fight terror on its soil.        
	The super-sensitive idea was broached in Islamabad by the US Vice-President elect, Joe Biden, at meetings today, according to sources close to the Congressional delegation of two Senators that is now visiting Southwest Asia, as Bidens office described the delegations itinerary.        
	Biden met Zardari and the chief of the army staff, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani. The Vice-President elect is said to have touched on the need to bring the terrorists responsible for the Mumbai attacks to justice when Zardari mentioned the urgency of clearing a $15-billion aid package for Pakistan which is now before the US Congress.        
	Biden implied a link between the assistance package and Indias list of 20 wanted terrorists, sources said, although he did not demand that Pakistan should hand over any suspect to India.        
	That delicate job is expected to be left to the tough-talking, no-nonsense Richard Holbrooke when he meets Zardari at Blair House, the presidential guest house, where Pakistans President is expected to stay when he comes to meet Obama within weeks.        
	Holbrooke is to be formally appointed in a few days by the incoming secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, as special envoy to South Asia.        
	Contrary to media reports that he will be special envoy for India and Pakistan, Holbrooke will be designated as special envoy for South Asia with responsibility for Pakistan and Afghanistan in deference to Indian sensitivities about mediation on Kashmir, sources here said.        
	In an obvious incentive to get the US to act, India last week speeded up long-pending negotiations and signed the largest ever deal for military hardware from the US, an order for eight P-8I Poseidon long-range maritime reconnaissance aircraft from Boeing at a cost of $2.1 billion.        
	State department officials said last night that they had told India that Chidambaram was welcome to Washington at any time of his choosing, but added that Rice had her hands full with the fighting in Gaza.        
	She spent the last two days at the UN dealing with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and may return to New York during the weekend.        
	Today, when Chidambaram was to arrive here, she had other engagements: two meetings with the foreign minister of Georgia, a key ally in the Bush administrations new cold war against Russias Vladimir Putin and another meeting with the foreign minister of Liberia, the officials said.        
	In addition, Rice and other political appointees of President Bush will empty their desks and clear out of their offices next Friday, four days before Obama takes office.

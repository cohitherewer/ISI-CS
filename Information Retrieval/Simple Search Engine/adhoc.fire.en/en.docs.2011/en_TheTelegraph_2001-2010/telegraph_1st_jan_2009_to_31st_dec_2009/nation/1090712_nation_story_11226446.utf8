The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Azad tip to control population
                                                                                                               Azad tip to control population
                            
	New Delhi, July 11 (PTI): Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad today asked people to opt for late marriages to check the exponential growth in population.         
	Azad was speaking at an event to observe World Population Day today, where rural couples choosing to marry after 18 and practising family planning were awarded.        
	However, the minister said there was no need to felicitate them as they were only abiding by the law. Only people who opt to marry at 30-31 should be awarded, he said.         
	When asked whether he wanted the marriageable age to be raised to 30, Azad replied in the negative, saying he was only talking about giving awards.         
	Pointing out that the population of India was putting pressure on scarce natural resources, he said: The fight in the future and at present is between the haves and the have-nots. The Naxalite movement is a result of this.        
	Information about family planning should be imparted at the grass-roots level, Azad added.

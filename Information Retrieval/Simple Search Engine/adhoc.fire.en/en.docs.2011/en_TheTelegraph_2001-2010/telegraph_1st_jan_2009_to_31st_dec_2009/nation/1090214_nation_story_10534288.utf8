	Calcutta, Feb. 13: Dr Pawan Pillai had enjoyed his stay at Dankuni, celebrating a family wedding, so much that he promised brother Chaandu this afternoon he would be back soon on another visit.        
	Hours later, the 45-year-old doctor from Berhampur, Orissa, had died a violent death before his children.        
	Pillai was returning home on the Coromandel Express with his family, and Chaandu, 38, had seen them off at Howrah station. They were in coach S-9.        
	We were dozing after dinner. There was a loud noise and a jerk and we were thrown off our berths, Pillais son Raja, 18, a software engineering student, told The Telegraph over the phone from Jajpur, Orissa.        
	My father fell unconscious but bore no injury marks. My sister Moni suffered a foot injury.        
	Raja alleged medical negligence. We took my father to Jajpur State General Hospital on a motorbike. I sat behind him, holding him. But the doctors did not take proper care and he died in front of my eyes, he said, his sobs audible over the phone.        
	If my father were the attending doctor, such a thing would never have happened to a patient.        
	Raja called us and gave the news. I still cant believe this, said Chaandu, who rushed to Howrah station with wife Lata and daughter Madhuri to try and catch a train to the accident site.        
	We enjoyed ourselves so much at the wedding. Today, I came here to see them off and the last thing my brother said was he would return soon, he said, weeping.        
	The family ran from official to official at Howrah station, requesting them to arrange a train. The officials are saying they dont have orders to send a special train, Chaandu said. Raja was calling his uncle constantly, asking him to be at his side.        
	We are trying to arrange a special train but till now there is no order from the authorities, a South Eastern Railway (SER) official said.         
	Eventually, a three-coach train carrying the victims relatives left Howrah around 3am on Saturday. The railways said the Coromandel Express passengers who were well enough would have the choice of returning to Howrah or continuing onwards to Chennai.        
	Earlier, relatives who had thronged the SER enquiry office at Howrah station had been left complaining. They are not giving us any information, said Tuhin Banerjee, whose relative Goutam Chakraborty, 39, a businessman from Howrah, had called to say he was hurt.        
	Passengers of other trains on the route too were complaining. I have a meeting at Bhadrak tomorrow but the train has been cancelled, said Sudeb Chowdhury, booked on the Howrah-Puri Weekly Express.

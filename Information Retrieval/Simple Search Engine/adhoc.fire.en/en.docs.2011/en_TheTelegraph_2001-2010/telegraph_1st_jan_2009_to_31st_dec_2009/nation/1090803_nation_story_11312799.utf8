                                                                                                               Rebels deny cop murder
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 2: Rebels today launched a poster drive in Kalimela, claiming that they had no role in killing two policemen whose bodies were found along the Daitari-Paradip highway on Wednesday.        
	The eight posters, found under the Telkoi police station area, read: We have not killed the officers. They were killed by the timber mafia. As Harichandanpur is the centre of our activities, they did this to put the blame on us.        
	On Wednesday bodies of assistant sub-inspector Muralidhar Bastia and homeguard Hadibandhu Mahanta were found in a pool of blood at Tinkulia, 6km from Brahmanipal beat house under Daitari police limits. An empty bullet case was also recovered near Mahantas body.         
	Bastia had his throat slit with a sharp weapon, while Mahanta was shot on the back of his head.        
	Eight such posters have been put up in the area. We have seized the posters, said Keonjhar superintendent of police Asit Panigrahi, who, however, still believes that it was the handiwork of the Maoists, who are commemorating martyrs week. The bullets used were typical that of the rebels. No timber mafia carries such weapons, he added.

	New Delhi, March 18: Home minister P. Chidambaram today said a decision on the Indian Premier Leagues second season would be taken after host states send their comments and views on the revised schedule, the third so far.        
	The last I heard (on the issue) was yesterday morning when they (the organisers) submitted a revised schedule. The schedule has been sent to all state governments concerned. Weve asked them to give their comments and views as early as possible, he said.        
	The ministers remarks came amid reports that some states, including Bengal, were inclined to accept the new fixture.        
	Bengal, among the at least five host states said to be agreeable to the new dates, today suggested it would send a confirmation.         
	Home secretary Ardhendu Sen said the government was writing to the Centre it had no problems with the fresh dates, between April 11 and April 26, for the matches in Calcutta.

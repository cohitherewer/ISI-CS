The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Maoists ambush 16 cops
                                                                                                               Maoists ambush 16 cops
          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                               
	Mumbai, May 21: Sixteen police personnel, including five women constables, were ambushed and killed this evening in a Maoist hotbed that had seen a 54 per cent turnout despite the rebels call for a poll boycott.        
	The attack in Gadchiroli, 300km from Nagpur, was the second such incident in the area in three months.        
	Inspector Avinash Iyer and sub-inspector Shantaram Ghorpade were on their way to clear a roadblock 50km from Gadchiroli town when they were surrounded and shot dead. The intimation about the roadblock to Dhanora police station, from where the team had set out, turned out to be a trap.        
	Gadchiroli collector Ajay Patne said another squad, led by district police chief Rajesh Pradhan, was fired at when it went to recover the bodies tonight. We should be able to get the bodies tomorrow, he said.         
	Todays attack, after a February 1 ambush that killed 15 policemen, is being viewed as an attempt to hit back at the authorities for having conducted the polls in the face of the boycott call, Patne said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bengal techie back from US found dead 
                                                                                                               Bengal techie back from US found dead 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            Saurav Maity      
	Tamluk, Oct. 26: A 30-year-old computer engineer who had returned home to Tamluk from the US last month was found hanging in his bedroom today, with police suspecting suicide and his parents clueless about the possible reason.        
	Saurav Maitys wife Deblina, an MTech, had returned to India a little earlier, in July. She now teaches at IIT Bhubaneswar, Sauravs father said at the familys two-storey house in this East Midnapore town, about 100km from Calcutta.        
	Joydeb Maity, 63, said Deblina was the daughter of Jadavpur University vice-chancellor Pradip Narayan Ghosh but the VC was not available for confirmation.        
	The young couple had lived in the US for two years, working with different companies, before deciding to settle in India but Sauravs departure from Massachusetts was a little delayed because his firm, E. Clinical Works, wouldnt accept his resignation.        
	There was nothing abnormal in his behaviour this morning. He served me at the breakfast table, asked if I was carrying enough money and gave me Rs 2,000, said Joydeb, a retired bank manager.        
	When the father left for Calcutta around 11am to attend to some personal business, Saurav asked him to be careful on the road. Joydebs wife Meena, a schoolteacher, had left for work half an hour earlier.        
	She returned around 4.30pm to find the gate open. Then she discovered her son hanging from the ceiling fan at the end of a nylon rope, and passed out. Saurav was declared dead at a local hospital.        
	A neighbour, Biswajit Ghosh, informed Joydeb on his cellphone. I was returning to Tamluk on a local train when I got the news on my phone. I got down in Mecheda and hired a car, said Joydeb, who reached home around 8pm.        
	The couples elder daughter, Shreyashi Maity, is a doctor and works at a private hospital in Calcutta.        
	The officer-in-charge of Tamluk police station, Subhankar Dey, said the post-mortem would establish the cause of death. He said the police had found neither any external injury nor a suicide note.        
	We had been in a perfectly happy mood this morning, Joydeb said, but added that Saurav would feel a little depressed at times. The reason was that his company in the US had refused to accept his resignation and asked him to continue working over the Internet from his home in India.        
	He even received his salary for September from the companys India headquarters in Mumbai, Joydeb said. But Saurav was unhappy because he didnt like the job, and because he couldnt apply for another in India since the company wouldnt give him a letter of discharge.        
	Saurav had done his BTech in computer science from Jadavpur University and his MCA in Bangalore.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cheap travel vow for poor 
                                                                                                               Cheap travel vow for poor 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mamata in Delhi. (Prem Singh)                                  
	New Delhi, May 23: Steel-and-iron wagons, human face.        
	The countrys poor can look forward to cheap train travel after Mamata Banerjee, named railway minister for the second time, today talked of monthly passes at a token charge to fulfil a social obligation.        
	Mamata said two mantras would be her guiding principle: modernise with a human face and empower the marginalised section to travel by train.        
	We will try to give economic freedom to marginalised sections vendors, unorganised sector workers, farmers, students for train travel. A token charge, maybe Rs 20, will be charged for a monthly pass which will give them the freedom to travel, she said.        
	It is a social obligation we have to fulfil for humanity. We will try to give economic freedom to these (marginalised) sections for train travel.        
	Mamata, however, made it clear she wouldnt be taking up her new assignment till other Trinamul Congress MPs were inducted in the Manmohan Singh cabinet. I am not taking charge right now as other members are yet to take oath. We are like a family and I cannot dissociate from them.        
	Singh is expected to expand his cabinet early next week after a compromise with the DMK is worked out.        
	Mamata, who was railway minister for 17 months in the NDA government, said the technicalities of providing monthly passes would be worked out after talks with officials.        
	The promise of a human touch, however, means the railways, which has a cash surplus of Rs 90,000 crore, would have to balance populist measures, completion of pending projects and initiation of new ones if it has to continue to be a profitable organisation.        
	Mamata, likely to be compared with Lalu Prasad who had turned the railways into a profit-making body, chose to be diplomatic when asked about the performance of her predecessor. I respect all my predecessors and would not like to comment on them.         
	Her tasks would include an east-west dedicated freight corridor, world class stations and high-speed bullet trains besides renewing rusted tracks, a mammoth job she had started during her earlier stint.

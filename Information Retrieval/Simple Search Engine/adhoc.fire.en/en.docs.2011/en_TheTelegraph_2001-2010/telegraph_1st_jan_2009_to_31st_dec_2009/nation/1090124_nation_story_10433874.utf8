The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Kerala CM wants Vijayan benched
                                                                                                               Kerala CM wants Vijayan benched
          JOHN MARY      
	Thiruvananthapuram, Jan. 23: Kerala chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan has demanded that his CPM rival and state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan, under the scanner for a tainted power deal, be stripped of his responsibilities till the Central Bureau of Investigation completes its probe.        
	It is learnt that the reason for Achuthanandans recent visit to Delhi was to hand over a letter to party chief Prakash Karat recommending the move.        
	The demand, bound to trigger further discord within the faction-riven party, came to light as the CBI requested the governors sanction for prosecuting Vijayan.        
	Vijayan, who heads the dominant faction in the state unit, had as power minister presided over the award of the controversial Rs 374.5-crore contract to Canada-based SNC Lavalin Inc for modernising three hydroelectric power stations.        
	The CBI is yet to file a chargesheet but, in an interim report, has accused Vijayan of criminal conspiracy, undue haste and bypassing central norms to ensure that the company got the plum deal, signed in July 1996.        
	Vijayan, power minister in the Nayanar cabinet from 1996 to 1998, had led two delegations to Canada during his brief tenure. He resigned in 1998 and took over as state CPM secretary following the death of the incumbent.        
	The major charge is that the Left government did not float a global tender, as stipulated by the Centre, for big contracts. Instead, a consultancy MoU signed with Lavalin during the Congress-led Antony government was upgraded into an agreement for the purchase of machinery.        
	The CPM justified the MoU route, saying Lavalin had committed to give Rs 98 crore for developing the Malabar Cancer Institute in return for the contract.        
	This commitment, however, was never written into the agreement, depriving the state any scope of reparation when the company reneged on its commitment after collecting its dues. Besides Vijayan, eight officers and two company representatives are on the list of the accused.        
	Achuthanandans letter also said that a proposed Kerala march by Vijayan be entrusted to someone else. The chief minister, sent back with the advice to wait until the politburo met towards the month-end, said a yatra undertaken by a tainted leader could adversely affect the party in the coming Lok Sabha elections.        
	Vijayan, who has always been against a CBI probe while Achuthanandan has been in favour of one, said the inquiry was aimed at destabilising the Left government. But all this will pass, he said.

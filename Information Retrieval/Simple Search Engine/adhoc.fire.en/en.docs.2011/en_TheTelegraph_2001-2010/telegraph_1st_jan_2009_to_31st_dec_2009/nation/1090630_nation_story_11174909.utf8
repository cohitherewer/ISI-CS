The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Water shortage makes Ujjain turn an old leaf
                                                                                                               Water shortage makes Ujjain turn an old leaf
          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	Bhopal, June 29: Even the holiest place cant get water for granted.         
	Ask Ujjains residents. The ancient citys population of about a million have returned to the basics, using donas and pattals (banana and bamboo leaves) as dinner plates, and disposable paper thermocol glasses to sip water and tea from.        
	Most parts of Madhya Pradesh are parched because of last years inadequate rainfall, but Ujjain is the worst hit. The holy Shipra river, which used to flow across the Malwa plateau, has dried up completely, cutting off supply to the hundreds of Hindu shrines dotting its banks.        
	The Shipra, a symbol of purity, hosts the Kumbh Mela once every 12 years.         
	Pandas kept the river going for a few months, emptying dozens of water tankers into it. But they finally gave up this summer, signalling an end to a series of religious activities that used to be an integral part of the river and a source of livelihood.        
	Councillor Dinesh Tinkar said 500 tankers were trying to quench the thirst of the citizens. The city needs over 500 lakh gallons of water daily.         
	Ujjain used to get water from the Gambhir dam, some 20km away, but that has now been reduced to a pool of mud.        
	The government then took over a reservoir owned by a defunct industrial unit at Nagda, 40km away. Two months ago, the local authorities divided Ujjain into two parts and started supplying tap water on Tuesday and Friday to old and new areas of the city. But the arrangement failed last week when the Nagda reservoir dried up.        
	Even a daily bath has become luxury for residents. Most of them take a bath once in two or three days, tormented as they are by the scorching heat  the mercury hovers around 40 degrees Celsius  and extreme humidity.         
	A water tanker carrying 5,000 litres, which used to cost Rs 200, now comes for double the rate. In the more upscale areas, around 10 households share water from a tanker.        
	Bhagwan Das, president of the citys Lions Club, said residents had been forced to improvise. Paper plates and leaves have replaced cutlery of all sorts because there is no water to wash them. If we do wash vegetables, we ensure that the used water is recycled for plants or in the toilet, he said, adding that washing clothes had become a luxury.        
	Councillors admitted that in the current situation, politics was the most challenging profession. Venu Bhaiya, a member of the Ujjain Municipal Corporation, said wryly: For us each day brings a fresh challenge. My job is to bring a water tanker to my ward and ensure that is equitably distributed among the rich and the poor, irrespective of caste or religious background.        
	Now all eyes are on divine intervention. A huge yagna is under way at the citys Mahakal temple to please Lord Shiva. The idol of Mahakaleshwar is given a lavish bath every day with enough water to fill a tanker.         
	People are hopeful that this extravaganza will reap benefits. But while pre-monsoon rains did arrive yesterday, many areas still await the first drops of water.

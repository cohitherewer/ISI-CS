The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Violence shuts down Tamil Nadu courts
                                                                                                               Violence shuts down Tamil Nadu courts
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chennai/New Delhi, Feb. 21: Madras High Court today ordered all courts in Tamil Nadu closed for two more days amid a standoff with lawyers seething at Thursdays police baton-charge inside the court complex.        
	All 40 high court judges met this afternoon to decide that courts across the state and Pondicherry would be shut till Tuesday, which means the loss of three successive working days. The high court had asked courts not to open on Friday after Thursdays clash, while Saturday and Sunday are holidays.        
	The lawyers, on their part, today announced a state-wide, indefinite court boycott despite Supreme Court strictures.        
	The high court has functioned just 10 days this year, with lawyers agitating in support of Sri Lankan Tamils and against proposed amendments to the criminal code.        
	After the baton-charge, the lawyers had torched a police station and burnt six government vehicles, prompting the administration to issue shoot-at-sight orders last night against those disturbing peace.        
	The police were ordered to take control of the court compound last night by evicting around 50 lawyers who were gearing for a sit-in strike. The lawyers, however, left after seeing the huge police team. Today, the police sealed the entire court complex.        
	The Supreme Court, which has banned strikes by lawyers, has asked Madras High Court bar associations to explain their frequent agitations that have paralysed the court. However, the lawyers announced an indefinite court boycott till top police officers were punished for Thursdays pre-meditated baton-charge.        
	Since the director-general of police (DGP) and city police commissioner were personally present during the violence, the action should be directed against them instead of transferring the joint commissioner of north Chennai, advocates association chief Paul Kanagaraj said.        
	On Thursday, lawyers had fought police on the high court premises to prevent the arrest of two colleagues over Tuesdays rotten-egg attack by pro-LTTE lawyers on Janata Party leader Subramanian Swamy.        
	Police officers justified the baton-charge. We were blamed for remaining mute witness to violence by law college students in November. Now, when lawyers throw eggs inside the court hall and we arrest them on instruction from judges, we are being accused of highhandedness, a senior officer said.        
	The state government, which had transferred the Chennai police commissioner after the law college violence, will find it difficult to punish officers for acting this time.        
	The Chief Justice of India, K.G. Balakrishnan, today described the violence and standoff as very unfortunate.        
	Some legal experts blamed the lawyers. Instead of fighting for the rule of law, lawyers have started breaking the law. The whole profession is at stake, former law minister Shanti Bhushan said in Delhi.        
	I dont know who is the provocateur, but you cant have violence, Supreme Court lawyer Anil B. Divan said.        
	Senior Tamil Nadu lawyer C.S. Vaidyanathan, however, would not blame the high court lawyers. He said the high court complex housed all district courts and several tribunals, so there are a large number of lawyers in the court. He suggested that non-active (legal) practitioners were responsible for the violence.        
	The Bar Council of India will meet tomorrow to decide its position. Its chairman S.N.P. Sinha denied that the councils reluctance to punish lawyers who break the law had led to such a situation.

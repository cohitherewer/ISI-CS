	Sinquerim (Goa), Feb. 6: With the Badshah of Bollywood staying away, the glam quotient at todays auction for the Indian Premier Leagues Season II was definitely lower than last years.        
	Two of Shah Rukh Khans leading ladies, though, did their best, not only adding glitter to the show but giving it its most dramatic half-hour.        
	While SRK nursed his injured shoulder in Mumbai, his friend and the female lead of his second film, Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman, filled in for him at the bidding table in her capacity as co-owner of the Kolkata Knight Riders.        
	Juhi Chawla, dressed in white Knight Riders T-shirt and jeans, made a contrast with Preity Zinta, who was a study in scarlet. Kings XI Punjab co-owner Preity, who also wore red at the last IPL player auction, thought red would be her lucky colour this time as well, said a friend of the actress.        
	Not so much. Preity was beaten by Juhi in a fast and furious battle for Bangladesh bowler Mashrafe Mortaza  the high point of the show. Red worked for Vijay Mallya, though: his Bangalore Royal Challengers bagged Kevin Pietersen for a record $1.55 million.        
	Shilpa Shetty was dressed for business in white-and-blue striped shirt, tucked into formal grey trousers.        
	I am just soaking the atmosphere in. It is a learning curve for me and I am having to be quick at understanding the nitty-gritty because I came in late, she smiled.        
	And no, she does not see her stake in the Rajasthan Royals as a Valentines Day gift from boyfriend Raj Kundra, a UK-based businessman. This was business. But I am sure there will be some gift coming my way on Valentines Day, she said.        
	Preity and Ness Wadia, who reached Goa on a Go Air flight yesterday afternoon, arrived separately at the auction, held at the Fort Aguada resort.        
	Mallya, who wore a sparkling red, printed Hawaiian shirt, was clearly in holiday mood, staying as he was at his beachfront Kingfisher Villa, a couple of properties away from the Taj Holiday Village. He was the last to enter the auction premises and was preceded by Nita Ambani, wife of Indias richest man.        
	Mukesh Ambani, unlike last time, skipped the auction. Nita, dressed in a simple pink salwar kameez, bid on his behalf, flanked by cricket board official Rajiv Shukla and Nikhil Meswani of Reliance.        
	Almost all the owners and officials camped at the Taj Holiday Village, adjoining Fort Aguada and connected with it by an internal walkway.        
	As they began walking in since around 10am, Fort Aguada, one of Goas prime luxury resorts built near a 16th-century Portuguese fort rampart and lighthouse, turned into Fort Knox.        
	We have been extra careful with security since the 26/11 attack on Taj property in Mumbai. We were on our toes at Aguada for the IPL auction since it involved the presence of some very high-profile people, a Taj Group of Hotels security official said from Mumbai.        
	Most of the owners left after lunch while the team officials attended an IPL workshop to be briefed on the decisions the governing council had taken yesterday.

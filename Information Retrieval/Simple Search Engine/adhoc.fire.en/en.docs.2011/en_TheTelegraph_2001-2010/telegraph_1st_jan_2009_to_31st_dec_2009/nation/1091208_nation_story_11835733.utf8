The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Joshi ousts Modi to capture desert pitch
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Joshi ousts Modi to capture desert pitch

	Jaipur, Dec. 7: Cricket czar Lalit Modi today lost a second election in nine months for the presidency of the Rajasthan Cricket Association, the crown going to Union minister C.P. Joshi who promised to leave politics out of the game after winning the scuffle-hit elections by six votes.        
	Joshi, the rural development minister considered close to Rahul Gandhi, secured 19 of the 33 votes up for grabs  each of the district cricket associations has one  while Modi got 13, one more than what he won in March when he was deposed. One association chose to abstain.         
	The result is another embarrassment for Modi, the boss of the cash-rich Indian Premier League, on his home turf but his post of vice-president in the Indian cricket board is secure as he holds a similar office in the Punjab Cricket Association.        
	But Modi can still keep a hawks eye on the RCA with loyalist B.L. Soni winning the post of deputy president unopposed. Shiv Charan Mali, known for his proximity to chief minister Ashok Gehlot, withdrew from the fray after extracting a Cabinet-rank posting of chairman of Rajasthan Sports Council in the bargain.         
	Joshi, a young Congress leader, is fast emerging as a competitor to Gehlot, who was thus far the partys mascot from the state.         
	Rajasthan cricket has been thrown into turmoil over the past few months ever since a bitter fight broke out for control of the association.         
	Modi lost the elections in March but in September, Sanjay Dixit, who succeeded him, was removed from power by the faction loyal to the IPL commissioner, which claimed majority. A no-confidence motion brought in by the Sriganganagar District Association was subsequently accepted, and it was decided that fresh elections would be held.         
	The bitter fight resulted in both factions sending teams for the Syed Mushtaq Ali Twenty20 tournament in October, which resulted in Rajasthan being barred from the event. A scheduled one-dayer between India and Australia in Jaipur was also moved to Vadodara because of the power struggle.         
	Joshis entire panel triumphed today. Dixit, an IAS officer, is back in the saddle, winning the post of secretary, while Mahendra Sharma bagged the treasurers job.        
	The election was marred by a scuffle earlier in the day between supporters of the two groups. But Modi, whose confidant Amin Pathan was roughed up and stopped from casting his vote, allegedly by Congress workers, chose not to blame any party or group.         
	It is unfortunate some of my supporters are being beaten up. But there are goonda and anti-social elements out here, who shouldnt be here, said the cricket administrator who has been embroiled in several cases in the state since the Congress came to power last year.         
	The refusal of Modi, said to be close to BJPs ex-chief minister Vasundhara Raje, to pin the blame on any party is a change from his stand following his March loss when he had blamed the state government for doing everything to ensure his defeat.        
	Mahmud Abdi, Modis counsel and member of the Sriganganagar association, told The Telegraph that the election had been fair.         
	Joshi, whose vote was cast by Dixit, was magnanimous in victory. Mr Modi congratulated me, I reciprocated and said we would sit together to provide a good atmosphere for cricket here, he said. There will be no politics in cricket.

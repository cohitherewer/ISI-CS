The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mercury down in north, turnout inches up
                                                                                                               Mercury down in north, turnout inches up
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	New Delhi, May 7: The least oppressive day of this summer election saw the highest turnout so far, the Election Commission said this evening, giving the preliminary figure of 57 per cent.        
	The fourth phase witnessed polling in 85 constituencies across eight states on a day maximum temperatures were lower by two to six degrees across most of northern India compared with the earlier phases, weather officials said. However, suspected sunstroke killed two voters in Bengal.        
	The voter turnout has been the highest compared with earlier phases, deputy election commissioner R. Balakrishnan said. We had made a lot of effort to mitigate the impact of the hot summer.        
	At many polling stations, the commission had set up stalls under canopies where voters were provided with water, even oral rehydration solutions (ORS).        
	Although Balakrishnan said todays turnout was the highest, the commission website shows the first phase turnout as 58-62 per cent (it doesnt explain why its a range). The second and third phase figures are 44 and 50 per cent.        
	Balakrishnan, however, suggested todays figure was likely to go up. These are not final figures, but the initial indications are good. Voters are still standing in queue at several polling stations as we speak.        
	According to the preliminary figures, Bengal recorded the highest turnout of the day at 75 per cent, Punjab registered 65 per cent, Haryana 63 per cent, and Delhi, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh around 50 per cent.        
	Bihar saw a 37 per cent turnout while Jammu and Kashmir recorded 24 per cent, which is higher than the 18.97 per cent witnessed in 2004 and 11 per cent in 1999.        
	The overall turnout in the Srinagar constituency  which includes Srinagar city, Ganderbal and Budgam  was 24 per cent. Srinagar city, virtually under siege to prevent anti-election protesters from creating trouble, recorded 12 per cent polling.        
	Voting, overall, was peaceful, Balakrishnan said, but referred to the violence in Bengal and Rajasthan, where one person was killed in police firing.        
	There were some incidents of violence in a few places in Bengal  in Murshidabad, Asansol and Nandigram. We have sought more details from the states chief electoral officer, he said.        
	In Rajasthan, he said, a gang had attacked poll staff. Rajasthan police said villagers from Olwara in the Tonk-Sawai Madhopur constituency had tried to forcibly cast their votes without proper identification proof, prompting the paramilitary CISF to intervene.        
	The villagers later gathered in large numbers and began throwing stones at the booth, prompting the jawans to fire 24 bullets in the air, killing Netram Meena, 33.        
	Polling was vitiated in 10 polling stations by complaints of forcible and bogus voting. Repolling will be held in all these polling stations. Overall, there were 20 to 25 instances of violence throughout, Balakrishnan said.        
	Bihar reported 22 instances of boycott, encouraged possibly by a similar trend in some other parts of the country in the earlier phases.        
	Polling was by and large trouble-free in Jammu and Kashmir and Uttar Pradesh, except for a brief standoff at a polling station where officials requested Mulayam Singh Yadav to send his armed guards away.        
	Z-category candidates are allowed only a plainclothes guard carrying concealed arms, but Mulayams security openly wielded their arms. The Samajwadi Party chief, however, complied with the officials request.

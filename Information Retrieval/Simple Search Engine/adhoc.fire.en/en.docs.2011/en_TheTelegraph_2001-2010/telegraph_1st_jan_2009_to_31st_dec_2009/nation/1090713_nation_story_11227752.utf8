          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, July 12: Stung by the Opposition tirade in the Assembly, chief minister Naveen Patnaik has ordered a vigilance probe into the alleged illegal mining activities in Keonjhar.         
	The chief minister has directed the state vigilance to conduct inquiry as to whether any mining activities were going on in the disputed area and locate the people involved in the illegal operation, said a source in the chief ministers office here.        
	The state anti-corruption agency will also probe as to whether the director of mines or any other official was involved in the alleged scam.        
	The issue had rocked the Assembly on Friday with the Opposition demanding a CBI probe into the alleged mining scam. The Opposition members had staged a walk out as the State steel and mines minister, Raghunath Mohanty rejected the demand for CBI probe. Meanwhile, the Opposition BJP, which deputed a fact-finding team to conduct an on-spot inquiry, has rejected the vigilance probe and insisted on a CBI inquiry.         
	Apprehending that the vigilance probe will not be impartial, BJP legislature party leader K.V. Singhdeo said: It seems that the Naveen government is scared of a CBI probe.         
	In 1994, the government had recommended the Centre to grant a lease for manganese mines spread over 36 hectares in Keonjhar in favour of Ram Bahadur Thakur Limited.        
	Subsequently, the Centre granted the lease in 1996.        
	However, the mining company was not allowed to undertake mining in absence of forest and environmental clearance.         
	Despite this, illegal mining activities were going on in the controversial site and manganese ore worth Rs 4,000 crore have been mined illegally by RB Thakur Limited so far, with the full knowledge of the government, alleged the Opposition members.

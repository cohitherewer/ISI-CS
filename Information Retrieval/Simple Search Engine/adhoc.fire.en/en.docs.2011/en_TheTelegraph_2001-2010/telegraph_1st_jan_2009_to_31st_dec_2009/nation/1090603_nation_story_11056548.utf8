The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | No smoking, Didi is here
                                                                                                               No smoking, Didi is here
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                              
	New Delhi, June 2: If you cant kick the butt, stub it out. Didi might be around.        
	Trinamul ministers and MPs today found out there can never be smoke without fire after Mamata Banerjee caught them puffing away inside her office in Parliament House.        
	Who is smoking here? she thundered, bursting into the room as her partymen cupped their cigarettes.        
	Junior urban development minister Saugata Ray sheepishly stubbed out his cigarette. The former college professor must have felt like a student again. Another MP made a quick exit.         
	The Trinamul members had been relaxing after a long swearing-in. Some were lounging around or chatting up journalists while waiting for fish fries, vadas and tea which Mamata had ordered for them, when she walked in.        
	Mamata went around the room, smiling at her MPs but also checking out known smokers to see if anyone was breaking the law, which forbids smoking in a public place.        
	The law came into effect last year from October 2, making India one of 78 countries that have banned smoking in public places.        
	Journalists and MPs sometimes share a furtive smoke in the veranda outside Parliaments press gallery, probably env ying their British counterparts. The British parliament is exempt from a smoking ban as it is defined as a residence.        
	Mamata, however, may not have rounded on her flock had it not been for partyman Dinesh Trivedi. Trivedi had first tried to stop his colleagues from stealing a smoke. Frustrated by their attitude, he appealed to his leader: Madam, our people are breaking the law.        
	His colleagues must have given him dirty looks, but they cant blame him really. As the junior health minister, he can say he was just doing his job.

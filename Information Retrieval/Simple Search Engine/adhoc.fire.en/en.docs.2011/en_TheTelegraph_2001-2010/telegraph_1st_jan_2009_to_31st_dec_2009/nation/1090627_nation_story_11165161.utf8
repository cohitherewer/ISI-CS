          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 26: Spurious liquor claimed six lives and rendered nine persons seriously ill at Gandapalli village in Orissas Bolangir district.         
	The villagers consumed hooch late last night after which they immediately started to complain of nausea, vomiting and dizziness. Three persons died on Thursday, followed by three more on Friday.        
	The toll reached six, while nine are still admitted at Burla Medical College, said district collector Aswathy S.        
	Vendor Budha Seth who sold the spurious liquor is now absconding. This is the second time since May that spurious liquor has claimed lives in the state.        
	On May 5, five persons died and at least 15 fell people fell ill after allegedly consuming spurious liquor at Badapokharia village of Khurda district.        
	However, the district administration is yet to confirm if hooch was the main cause behind the toll. Samples of the liquor has been collected and sent for tests, said Aswathy.        
	Bodies have been sent for post-mortem.

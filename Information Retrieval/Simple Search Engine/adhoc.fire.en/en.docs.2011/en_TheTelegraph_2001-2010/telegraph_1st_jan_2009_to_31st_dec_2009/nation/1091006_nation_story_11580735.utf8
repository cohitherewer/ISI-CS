          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                          Balakrishnan                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 5: The highest court is seeking justice, from a lower court.        
	For decades, the Supreme Court has decided appeals against high court judgments. For the first time, a high court will decide an appeal by the Supreme Court  against a high court verdict.        
	The apex court today challenged a Delhi High Court judgment that said information on whether judges had declared their assets to the Chief Justice of India (CJI) was covered under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.        
	The apex court registrar filed the appeal with a division bench of the high court, seeking a stay on the September 2 judgment by a single-judge bench that it said would affect the integrity of the court.        
	The judgment related not to the content of judges assets declarations but only to whether they had been made. Still, activists had saluted the ruling saying it would usher in an era of judicial accountability and transparency.        
	The Chief Justice, however, had publicly stated that the judgment would open a Pandoras box and compromise the judiciarys independence.        
	Judges can now voluntarily reveal their assets to the CJI on the basis of a May 1997 apex court resolution. The court has since then passed another resolution to place this information on its official website for public scrutiny (such information usually contains little detail).        
	But it has refused to accept that such information can be forced out of it through the RTI Act, arguing this could open the way for demands on a host of other information.        
	Notwithstanding the resolution of the full court passed on 26 August 2009 to put declaration of assets on the website, the judgment raises far-reaching and substantial questions relating to institutional integrity of the court independence of the judiciary, position of judges individually and the judiciary as an institution under the Constitution and the offices of the Chief Justice of India and the chief justices of the high courts, the appeal says.        
	The apex court, however, has agreed to provide the information sought by RTI activist S.C. Aggarwal, denial of which had led him to appeal in the high court, which ruled in his favour.        
	The apex courts appeal offers several arguments:        
	Section 2(j) of the RTI Act asks an applicant to prove his locus for seeking privileged information, but the high court verdict side-steps this issue.        
	The judge has completely skirted the heart of the matter and has delved into realms of abstract principles of essential ethical behaviour of judges and norms of judicial behaviour which were completely irrelevant to decide the basic issue as to whether Respondent No. 1 (Aggarwal) had a right to the information sought.        
	The phrase right to information in Section 2(j) refers to information held by or under control of a public authority. But voluntary assets declarations by judges to the CJI are not information held by or under the control of any public authority.        
	 The judiciary has a lot of information that are, strictly speaking, in possession of a public authority but cannot be made public. For instance, one can argue that a judges medical records are available under the RTI Act.        
	An applicant can ask for medical records saying the treatment was exaggerated or that the payment made was in excess and this opens the judge to unnecessary harassment.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 23: Some visitors who called on the Prime Minister shortly before he left for AIIMS said he looked cheerful.         
	The Prime Minister deferred his departure by an hour and left after having a meal with his wife and two daughters who live in Delhi.        
	Singh signed pending papers and met cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrashekar, his principal secretary T.K.A. Nair and Prithviraj Chavan, the deputy minister in the PMO. In between, Sonia Gandhi and Pranab Mukherjee called on him.        
	The Prime Minister walked from his residence to the visitors room and saw Mukherjee off to his car.         
	Among the last orders signed by the Prime Minister before he left his residence at 1.30pm for the All India Institute of Medical Sciences was to unbundle finance ministership on Mukherjee.         
	Manmohan Singh was toying with the idea of appointing a full-fledged finance minister and was not too happy about doing the job himself after P. Chidambaram was moved to home following the Mumbai attacks.        
	Singh occasionally told his confidants that he felt deeply stressed out with having to cope with economic exigencies.        
	His candidates for finance were Planning Commission deputy chairperson Montek Singh Ahluwalia and former RBI governor C. Rangarajan. But the Congress, which indulged him through the Indo-US nuclear deal, was in two minds, tilting more towards a political face in an election year.        
	Mukherjees name was ratified by Singh and Sonia when she visited the Prime Minister today. Mukherjee was called and informed of the decision.         
	Although Chidambaram had answered finance-related questions in the Prime Ministers absence in the last session of Parliament, sources said Singh and Sonia felt that the home ministers focus should be on internal security.         
	Until last night, the Congresss view was that unless it was absolutely necessary, the Prime Ministers surgery should take place after Republic Day. Sources said when the ECG readings from a monitor showed certain irregularities, he was advised by doctors to go in for a bypass at the earliest.        
	Although Singh is not expected to campaign actively, as in the past, and confine himself to speaking in indoor gatherings in big state capitals, sources said given his near-iconic status among opinion-moulders and movers and shakers, the Congress must ensure his leadership stayed intact.        
	Once the decision was taken, members of the cabinets political affairs committee that included Lalu Prasad and Sharad Pawar were informed.

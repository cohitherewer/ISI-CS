The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PC to review Maoist illusion 
                                                                                                               PC to review Maoist illusion 
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	Koraput, June 28: Lalgarh rang the alarm bells. Koraput and Kandhamal punctured the statistical illusion.        
	Union home minister P. Chidambarams two-day visit to the two Orissa districts is set to change the very basis on which Left-wing extremism is being dealt with now.        
	At a meeting last December, the ministry had said 85 per cent of Maoist violence was concentrated in 33 most extremist-affected districts across eight states  Chhattisgarh, Orissa, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh (see chart below).        
	A special task force headed by the cabinet secretary has been taking care of these 33 districts under an action plan decided this February with an open-ended budget totalling more than Rs 10,000 crore.        
	Eight inter-ministerial groups, under officers of the rank of joint secretary, had co-ordinated the drafting of the plans for the home ministry-piloted project with the focus on rural road connectivity, health, education and power.         
	But neither the two Orissa districts nor any from Bengal figured among the 33 most-affected districts. Kandhamal, where Naxalites have exploited the deepening communal fault lines, does not figure even on a list of 76 of Indias 625 districts officially declared extremist-affected.        
	This meant that while the government focused on the districts that had been labelled affected, the Maoists quietly infiltrated neighbouring ones, gradually encircling the affected districts.        
	That was before Lalgarh sent the alarm bells ringing, and Chidambaram chose to visit riot-scarred Kandhamal and Koraput, where Maoists recently blew up eight members of a police patrol and the driver.         
	In Kandhamal, where the CPI (Maoist) was filling in the vacuum in the absence of any political activity, Chidambaram asked riot victims in refugee camps to be brave and strong and return home.        
	After a meeting on Thursday night, police forces left for Koraputs Narayanpatna block, which had since June 15 been under the control of a tribal organisation now infiltrated by Maoists.        
	Forget the (extremist-affected) list, I know which districts are affected, the home minister, who held talks with chief minister Naveen Patnaik, said while returning from Bhubaneswar on Friday.        
	It is a statistical illusion that only 76 districts are affected, a senior home ministry official said. More than 170 districts in the country are actually under Naxalite influence.        
	Asked about Bengal, Chidambaram said he would watch how the state government acts on the CPI (Maoist) ban.        
	Sources said Chidambarams visit might change the way the special development plans for the 33 most-affected districts  submitted to the government this month  were implemented.  
	TROUBLE ZONES  
	Official list of the most  extremist-affected districts    Jharkhand: Gumla, Lohardaga, East Singhbhum, West Singhbhum, Garwa, Palamau, Latehar, Chatra, Hazaribagh, Bokaro   Chhattisgarh: Kanker, Sarguja, Rajnandgaon, Dantewada, Bijapur, Bastar, Narayanpur   Madhya Pradesh: Balaghat   Andhra Pradesh: Khammam   Bihar: Rohtas, Jehanabad, Aurangabad, Gaya, Arwal, Jamui   Orissa: Devgarh, Gajapathi, Sambalpur, Rayagarh, Malkangiri   Maharashtra: Gadchiroli   Uttar Pradesh: Gondia, Sonebhadra

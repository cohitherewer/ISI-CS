The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP fury over illegal mining
                                                                                                               BJP fury over illegal mining
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 8: The preliminary inquiry report of the vigilance wing of Orissa police confirmed illegal mining activities in mineral-rich Keonjhar district, prompting the Opposition BJP to reiterate its demand for a CBI probe into the Rs 4,000-crore mining scam.        
	The preliminary report of the state vigilance, which was submitted to the government yesterday, revealed that illegal mining was going on in Keonjhar district in connivance with officials of the mines and forest departments.        
	There was illegal mining in some manganese mines in Keonjhar district, vigilance director Anup Kumar Patnaik said. Corruption case would soon be registered against the officials who encouraged such illegal activities, he added.        
	A private firm, which was liquidated long ago, was allowed to guard the manganese mine area by the directorate of mines by violating norms, he added. The team found positive evidence of illegal mining activities by the firm without forest or pollution board clearance, he said.         
	Preliminary report of vigilance has vindicated our allegation. But the finding of the vigilance was just the tip of an iceberg, said BJP state president Suresh Pujari today. Such a big racket cannot thrive without political patronage, he said, alleging that some top leaders of the ruling BJD were behind the racket. He, however, did not divulge the name of the politicians.        
	Stating that the vigilance inquiry would not be able to unearth the real truth, he reiterated the demand for a CBI inquiry into the multi-crore scam. If chief minister Naveen Patnaik is honest and transparent, why is he hesitating to hand over the investigation to CBI? he asked.         
	Pujari said that the BJP would stage agitation at Keonjhar on August 12 to press for CBI probe.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Push for education ties 
                                                                                                               Push for education ties 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, June 11: India is keen to expand education ties with the US but will not tolerate fly-by-night institutions keen to set up shop here, education minister Kapil Sibal told American undersecretary of state William Burns today.         
	Sibal and Burns, undersecretary for political affairs in the US state department, decided to set up a joint working group between the two nations to monitor plans to expand education ties.         
	India already has such joint working groups in education with at least 30 countries and barring six, all were set up under Arjun Singhs tenure at the helm of the HRD ministry.         
	A joint working group with the US was never seriously contemplated during Arjuns tenure because of his close ties with the Left, which is opposed to Indias increasing proximity to America, a senior official said.         
	But the working group Sibal and Burns agreed on is likely to be politically both more powerful and significant than most or all such collaborations India has with other countries.         
	Most such working groups are discussed at the ministry only just before a meeting with counterparts from the other country, sources in the international co-operation wing of the ministry said.         
	But India sends more students to the US than to any other country in the world  around 90,000 every year.         
	The memorandums of understanding that create such working groups with other countries do not require the HRD minister himself to represent India at the groups meetings.         
	But Sibal, according to a statement issued by the ministry today, will head Indias representation in the working group with the US, which will be represented by American education secretary Arne Duncan.         
	The fact that the minister himself is heading Indias representation at the group shows the importance we are giving to this relationship, an official said.         
	The political significance of the working group will stem from the role it is likely to play in increasing American investment in Indias education sector and restructuring regulations currently guiding such investment.         
	Sources in the ministry confirmed that Sibal today told Burns India was keen to invite American investment in education.         
	But the US is likely to want India to relax its stringent barriers in higher education to foreign providers.

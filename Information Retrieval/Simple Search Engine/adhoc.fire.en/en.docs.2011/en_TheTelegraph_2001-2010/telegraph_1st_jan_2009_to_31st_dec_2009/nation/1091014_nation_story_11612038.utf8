          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 13: Officials of state agriculture department today called for a statewide ceasework in protest against the assault on a senior officer of the department allegedly by BJP workers, even as the government ordered an administrative probe into the alleged incident by the revenue divisional commissioner.        
	Deputy director of agriculture (Sambalpur) D.C. Pal had yesterday faced the wrath of BJP leaders during a Krushak Mela in Sambalpur with the partymen smearing black paint on his face, protesting against his report on the issue of farmers suicide. He was also allegedly manhandled.        
	The officer had stated in his report that Gourahari Patra, a farmer of Sagarpalli village in Jharsuguda district, had committed suicide not for crop failure but for the loan burden he incurred for his daughters marriage. This made the BJP workers angry.        
	The Orissa Agriculture Service Association today threatened to launch cease-work from October 15 in protest against the governments failure to protect its officials.

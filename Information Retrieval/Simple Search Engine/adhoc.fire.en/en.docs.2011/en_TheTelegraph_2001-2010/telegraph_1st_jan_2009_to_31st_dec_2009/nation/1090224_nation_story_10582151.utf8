The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Slumdog 8 Benjamin 3
                                                                                                               Slumdog 8 Benjamin 3
                              The Slumdog cast and crew on stage after the film won best picture. (AP)                            
	Remember it as the night when the British graciously conceded ownership of Slumdog Millionaire to the Indians.        
	Indeed, when its eighth and final Oscar was announced  that for best picture  normal Oscar tradition was lost in transition as anyone who was Indian inside the Kodak Theatre appeared to rush on to the stage as though catching a peak-hour train from VT station in Mumbai where, it so happens, the end credits in Slumdog were filmed.                    THE SLUMGODS      
	There was a beaming Anil Kapoor, who probably never had imagined he would one day occupy an Oscar platform. Next to him was Irrfan Khan who stood in front of author Vikas Swarup. Some of the child actors from Slumdog had the happy look of children who had been allowed to stay up way past their bedtime. Director Danny Boyle and producer Christian Colson seemed entirely relaxed about having the entire proceedings hijacked by Indians.        
	As a contest between Slumdog Millionaire and the technologically driven The Curious Case of Benjamin Button  a moral tale about a film, starring Brad Pitt, which begins with 13 possible Oscars and goes backward in time to a film with only three  the battle proved somewhat one-sided.        
	Just after 7.28pm, though, the score was 3-2 in Benjamin Buttons favour but then as the evening progressed, Slumdog put another six into the net. The final score was Slumdog 8 Benjamin Button 3.        
	As early as 6pm, there were indications that things would go Slumdogs way when Simon Beaufoy scored for the visitors by taking the Oscar for best adapted screenplay  Slumdog 1 Benjamin Button 0.        
	I certainly wouldnt be standing here tonight without Vikas Swarup, who wrote the book, without which none of Slumdog would ever have happened, Beaufoy said generously. So thank you, Vikas.        
	He presented Vikas as Vickers. Indias deputy high commissioner in South Africa nodded graciously.        
	Beaufoy also thanked Tessa Ross, from Film4, who shoved the manuscript into my hand and said, This is yours, you must go to India.        
	There were also acknowledgments for the wonderful Dev (Patel), the wonderful Latika (a reference to Freida Pinto) and the cast and crew of the film who have taught me so much about India and so much about writing, so theyve all changed my life.        
	Beaufoy was remarkably forthcoming about the process of adapting Swarups Q amp; A. I think you have to be very bold. And in some respects, you have to be wilfully disrespectful to material. You have to put the book away and do your own thing. Ive learned over the years that the worst thing you can do is be very respectful to the material and kind of transliterate from book to screen. Its such a different medium. You have to take the core of it and then change everything around it. I always say to the novelist if Im adapting a novel, Everything will change but I promise to keep the soul of your novel the same.        
	He was open about how the experience of India had affected him.        
	Mumbai is a very operatic, melodramatic place. Its a place of massive extremes. I just responded to that and started writing with these kinds of extremes, because it seemed appropriate to the place.        
	He went on: I learned to stop being English about things like love. If you make a film in England about love, its hugely complicated. Its all about marriage therapy; its all about subtext. Its all about saying what the weather is like, and youre secretly telling someone you love them. You know what the English are like; theyre very repressed people. Lets be honest; you dont get that in India. India is incredibly uncynical about love.        
	He revealed details of his interaction with filmmakers in India.         
	Ive been contacted by a lot of Indian actors and directors who say, Finally, we dont have to make a film about the middle classes getting married and have five song-and-dance sequences in front of the French Alps. We can do something else now. And weve taken quite a lot of flak for showing the slums of Mumbai and showing a side of India that Bollywood just simply didnt look at. Its not a criticism, its just not their genre at all to look towards the working classes and the poor of India. They just dont do that in the cinema.        
	Beaufoy claimed Slumdog may have consequences for Indian cinema. It sort of opened up a new cinematic pathway for Indian directors. At least, thats what theyre telling me. So that could be incredibly exciting. If you get all these immensely talented directors and actors in India work, that whole new feel, if you can get Hollywood and Bollywood combined, you got a whole new genre of cinema, and to me, the potential is amazing.        
	Students of cinema will want to analyse Beaufoys philosophy. Slumdog Millionaire, he believes, is a mythic story; its a search. Its like an Arthurian question, deeply buried in our DNA as human beings. Its a search for someone that appeals to people. But, also, its come out at a very interesting time, and none of us could have anticipated that. Its come out at a time when the value of money, which has been raised to this extraordinary height, is suddenly being shown to be a very shallow thing. The financial markets are crashing around the world and a film comes out which is ostensibly about being a millionaire. Actually, what its about, its a film that says theres more important things than money: love, faith and family. And so that the timing of when this film came out had a tremendous impact.        
	At 6.20pm came the equaliser: Benjamin Button scored with art direction. Five minutes later, Benjamin Button pulled ahead, with an Oscar for make-up artist. At 6.33pm, Slumdog found the back of the net with Anthony Dod Mantle taking achievement in cinematography.        
	Danny and I were going to make another film actually in America and it crashed because of financing and kind of expecting competition with Benjamin Button, so we backed off and had to move very quickly to Mumbai, said Mantle. And even though we had very little time to prepare for Dannys film, it helped that I have known him for five or 10 years and made five films with them. He then ate away three weeks of my five weeks of pre-production. This was shoot, shoot, shoot. My main brief was to learn how to run with the boys, learn how to run with them at a certain height, at a certain pace, in a certain intimate way, and that was a pretty difficult thing, actually, in the slums of Mumbai. Thats where I spent most of my time into shooting.        
	He provided an insight into slum life which would be unfamiliar to many Indians. The slums were obviously extraordinary because were encroaching on peoples lives. At the same time we had got carte blanche and the green light to go in there and basically destroy their daily lives. You open a cupboard and a family of 15 fall out. And there will be dogs and all sorts of things coming at you. Thats how it is.        
	Benjamin Button went into the lead at 7.28pm with outstanding visual effects but there its tally would remain.        
	At 7.33 came a blinder from Resul Pookutty and his teammates Ian Tapp and Richard Pryke for sound mixing. Score 3-3.        
	Only three minutes later, Chris Dickens took Slumdog ahead by taking the statuette for film editing. Score 4-3 to Slumdog.        
	I had a fantastic time working on this film, declared Dickens. Id like to thank my crew in India firstly. That was Vivek, Udayan, Anuradha.        
	Then there occurred a magical interlude. At 7.53, the opposition were caught napping as A.R. Rahman put in a couple in rapid succession for best original score and best original song. The score was now Slumdog 6 Benjamin Button 3.         
	As if the Benjamin Button team had not seen enough of the interlopers from India, Freida Pinto, Slumdogs female lead, came on stage to give away the Oscar for best foreign film.        
	Benjamin Button abandoned all hope when Danny Boyle got the best director Oscar at 8.50, followed immediately by Christian Colson, the producer who collected the award for best picture.         
	The final score 8-3.        
	Boyle jumped up and down in a passable impression of Tigger from Winnie the Pooh.        
	I dont know what it looks like on television, everybody, but in the room, its bloody wonderful, really, he said.        
	He thanked Mumbai with three baffling words  unending, inseparable, unborn.        
	By the time Colson could come on stage, it was a case of too many Indians and not enough Oscars to give away. When the refs whistle went, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, Hollywoods hottest couple who always hog the front row on such occasions, were nowhere to be seen.        
	Again for students of cinema, Boyle and Colson discussed Slumdog with journalists at some length.        
	Our film was a collaboration between hundreds of people, began Colson. Im so happy that so many of them could be with us here tonight to share this moment. Together, weve been on an extraordinary journey. When we started out, we had no stars, we had no power or muscle. We didnt have enough money, really, to do what we wanted to do. But what we had was a script that inspired mad love in everyone who read it. We had a genius for a director. We had a cast and a crew who were unwavering in their commitment and whose talents are up on the screen for all of you to see.        
	Boyle offered his reasoning for altering Swarups novel. What I loved about his (Beaufoys) script, genuinely, is that apparently at the beginning, the spine of the story appears to be the game show. And actually what happens, this is different from the novel, is that as you peel back the spine, theres another spine underneath, which is a love story, which is much stronger than a television show. Its much deeper, more profound, more recognisable, more loveable, more timeless than a game show. And listen, we all want to get ourselves lost in romance.         
	Colson interjected: We were like a big family, and it was this huge team. You saw us all on stage tonight together, and thats what makes me really, really happy, you know. We all did it together.         
	The questions got a bit personal  were Dev and Freida in love?         
	They were asked: One of your stars made some headlines over the weekend by suggesting it might be a bit of  I think his words were  were slight romance between your leading actor and your leading lady. It would be amazing case of life imitating art. Is there anything in it?         
	Boyle did not issue an outright denial. Have no idea, he said gruffly.         
	I dont know. Dev and Freida have been extraordinary because its their first film for both of them and they have shouldered the responsibility of fronting the film, of being the badge of the film, really. And it takes the weight off us enormously. And it also makes the film expand to a much bigger audience, because a lot of the mainstream audience relates to actors and their experience through actors and part of that is dreaming about romance and all those kind of things, you know. And so, I have no idea and I wouldnt wish to add to it or take away from it. Whatever is true, I have no idea.         
	Coulson volunteered: Actually, I know. And its not true.         
	Boyle: Is it not?         
	The dialogue was getting very filmy.         
	Coulson: I dont think so. Unless they are lying to me, its not true. But they have grown up in front of our eyes in the last seven or eight months, and its been extraordinary for us to watch that happen. And to see them now be able to stand in front, in rooms like this with such poise and grace and maturity.        
	Boyle was more comfortable dealing with the issue of bringing over the Mumbai children. When we got the nominations we had been thinking about it. We were very concerned about distorting their lives, all of them really, because they are young. They should stay at school. We put two of them into school.        
	Boyle went on: But then somebody said to us, look, They will put it in their own memory bank in their own way, whatever their lives are. They should get the chance to experience it. And its impossible to imagine what they think of coming here for tonight.         
	You know, you talk to them, but you cant really imagine what it must feel like. It must be extraordinary really. Its lovely to have brought them together, really. And it makes tonight deeply special for us, because we tried to make the film as a family unit. Tanvi and Tanay, who play the middle Latika and middle Jamal, were very full of tears on stage. They were overwhelmed by it. They were really, really crying and crying. It was beautiful watching them and very touching.         
	Theres this expression, this amazing British poet called W.H. Auden, he talks about Americans putting juke boxes. Its to do with when America was trying to travel to the moon. Its really interesting because, of course, India is now going to the moon. This is the plan. And he talks in his poem about putting juke boxes on the moon. Soon you will be putting juke boxes on the moon. I love that expression, and thats what tonight feels like. The bringing together of things that are just so unlikely and yet wonderful and about entertainment and pleasure and exploring things and changing things.        
	He disclosed: The Toronto Film Festival gave us this peoples prize, which is an extraordinary start, you know, a kick-off, a wonderful and they also gave us $15,000 and we put the $15,000 in the fund for educating the kids. And now we have got plenty of money so.        
	Oscar night, according to Boyle, had signalled a coming together of Bollywood, who gave us virtually all our cast and crew, and Hollywood, which has been responsible for the elevation of the film. The world is shrinking a bit in a wonderful way, and it will benefit from it because in culture, fusion is a wonderful thing. And I felt it most in the music working with A.R. Rahman.

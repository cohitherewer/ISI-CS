          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Feb. 18: Cuttack Development Authority (CDA) may have to forfeit money taken from plot owners of Abhinava Bidanasi Kataka if it fails to justify its 59 per cent land price hike, a demand made in 2000.        
	Orissa High Court has also ruled that the CDA may have to refund the sum paid by purchasers, if it fails to show a cause behind the hike. The order ends an eight-year-old dispute over enforcement of a post-allotment hike on prices without prior notice.         
	The township is divided into 15 sectors, out of which 13 have been designed as residential sectors.         
	So far, eight residential sectors have been developed and allotted to the public in the past two decades.        
	When the CDA hiked prices by 59 per cent in 2000, it demanded the amount from those who had already taken possession of the allotted land in sectors 7, 8, 9 and 10 in previous years, paying rates existing then.         
	As many as 40 petitions were filed in the high court after the demand.

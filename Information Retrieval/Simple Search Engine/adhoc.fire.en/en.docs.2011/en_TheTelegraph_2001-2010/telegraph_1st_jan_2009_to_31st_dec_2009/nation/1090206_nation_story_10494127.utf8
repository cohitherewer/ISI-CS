The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | India names ISI on Mumbai strike 
                                                                                                               India names ISI on Mumbai strike 
          OUR BUREAU                          Menon: Direct jab                                  
	New Delhi/Islamabad, Feb. 5: India today blamed spy agency ISI for the Mumbai terror attacks, in its most direct accusation yet against Pakistan.        
	Speaking about the threat of terror in the neighbourhood, foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon said in Paris: For India, the most graphic recent instances were the bombing of our embassy in Kabul on July 7, 2008, and the Mumbai attacks of November 26, 2008. In each case, the perpetrators planned, trained and launched their attacks from Pakistan, and the organisers were and remain clients and creations of the ISI.        
	So far, India has blamed elements in Pakistan for the terror attack on Mumbai and hinted at ISI support for the terrorists but this is the first time it has named the Pakistan spy agency. However, it has blamed the ISI for the Kabul attacks in the past, too.        
	In Delhi, foreign ministry spokesperson Vishnu Prakash said banned terrorist groups continued to thrive in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.         
	We have seen reports that representatives of the terrorist groups Jaish-e-Mohammad, Harkat-ul Mujahideen and Jamaat-ud-Dawa participated in a public meeting yesterday at Muzaffarabad in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. No effort was made by the authorities to curb the activities of these groups. We strongly condemn the licence that banned terrorist organisations continue to enjoy in territory under Pakistans control, he said.         
	Vishnu Prakash added that concerns that prompted the travel advisory on December 26, 2008, asking Indians to stay away from Pakistan, still exist. Indian nationals are advised that it would be unsafe for them to travel or be in Pakistan, he said.         
	The foreign ministry has sought details from the high commission in Islamabad about two Indian journalists being attacked there.        
	Menon, who was speaking on Indian foreign policy, said Islamabad continued to avoid replying to the Indian dossier containing evidence regarding the Mumbai attacks.         
	Two months after the Mumbai attacks, and one month after we presented a dossier of evidence linking the attacks to elements in Pakistan, we still await a response from the Pakistani authorities, and prevarication continues, Menon said.         
	India lives next to the epicentre of international terrorism in Pakistan, he added.         
	In Islamabad, local media reports said Pakistani investigators probing the Mumbai attacks were closing in on a Bangladeshi connection to the terrorist strike.        
	The investigators are said to have evidence of not only the involvement of a banned militant organisation, the Harkat-ul-Jihad-al Islami, Bangladesh, but also of its role in planning the attack and training the terrorists, the English daily Dawn reported.        
	Pakistani officials termed the reports premature.         
	It is premature to draw such conclusions at this stage while a report is being given final touches after review by the law department, a senior official said. It is like jumping the gun.         
	The official said the report was still under serious review in the interior ministry and Pakistani officials had tried to prepare a clause-by-clause response to the evidence New Delhi had provided.         
	He said the summary of the report would soon be submitted to Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani.         
	Interior ministry spokesperson Shahidullah Baig refused to comment, saying only ministry chief Rehman Malik was authorised to speak.         
	The Dawn said there were also clear indications that some of the planning was done in Dubai.         
	There is also an element of local Indian support, the daily added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mulayam asks Sonia to take poll call
                                                                                                               Mulayam asks Sonia to take poll call
          OUR BUREAU                              Mulayam, Amar: Decision time				                                 
	New Delhi, March 1: Armed with a bypoll victory, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Amar Singh today asked Sonia Gandhi to make up her mind if she wanted an alliance and, if so, come clean on how many seats she expected.        
	Before entering Sonias residence, Mulayam told the media he wanted an alliance with the Congress and was ready to compromise.        
	Congress sources said the party demanded 18 of the 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh but Mulayam was ready to give only 12. A deal on a consensus figure of 14 or 15, however, appeared possible.        
	Samajwadi leaders appeared upbeat after todays shock byelection victory in the Bhadohi Assembly constituency, which they wrested from the Bahujan Samaj Party by a margin of over 5,000 votes.        
	Although a lone victory cannot be an index of popular mood in a state as socially complex as Uttar Pradesh, Samajwadi sources made two points.        
	One, it will boost our workers morale. They were confused and dispirited about the state of things with the Congress and the entry of Kalyan Singh, a legislator from eastern Uttar Pradesh said.        
	Two, the Samajwadis are pleased that the Congress candidate lost his deposit and was beaten by a contestant from a new regional outfit. Let them get an idea of their real strength before they demand seats from us, the MLA said.        
	The Samajwadis have already announced 61 candidates, leaving just 19 for negotiations. The residual seats include the Gandhis family boroughs, Amethi and Rae Bareli.        
	Sources said Mulayam and Amar were not prepared to yield the other seats the Congress had demanded  such as Farrukhabad, Rampur and Pratapgarh for Salman Khursheed, Noor Bano and Ratna Singh.        
	The Congress plan is to field 25 candidates and try to retain its earlier tally of nine  even, perhaps, pick up an extra two or three and touch a respectable double-digit figure.        
	So if we get 18, which is a realistic figure, we shall have friendly fights against the Samajwadis in the remaining seven. They shouldnt have an issue with that, a source said.        
	Given the suspicion and rancour that have marked the negotiations, sources in both parties ruled out a joint campaign  at least as of now, a Congress official said. Congress ally Lalu Prasad is working on Mulayam.        
	Hoping to keep up with the BSP, the Samajwadis will field candidates in states such as Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar, where they have limited pockets of influence.

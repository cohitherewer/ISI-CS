The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Toxic US liner gets clean chit 
                                                                                                               Toxic US liner gets clean chit 
  - Ship not a threat, experts tell govt        G.S. MUDUR AND BASANT RAWAT                      Platinum II off Saurashtra. File picture                                
	Oct. 24: A panel of experts has told the Indian government that toxic and radioactive materials aboard a US ocean liner waiting to be dismantled as scrap off Alang on Gujarats coast do not pose a serious threat, sources in the Union environment ministry said.         
	The ministry had asked a three-member panel to examine the environmental and health threats posed by Platinum II, the 58-year-old ship that was once a luxury cruise liner and is now anchored about 40 nautical miles from the Alang coast.         
	In its report, the panel comprising experts from the environment ministry, the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board and the steel ministry has indicated that the toxic materials on the ship is not in a loose form.         
	It also said that the radioactive material on the ship appeared to be confined to onboard smoke detectors and certain illumination zones, the sources said.         
	The report is in  it will be made public on Monday, but the ministry has yet to take a decision (on the fate of the ship), the sources said. Environmental activists believe the ship contains a significant amount of potentially toxic asbestos and other chemicals.         
	Green activists say the ships arrival in India violates the Basel Convention to which India is a party. Under the treaty, India is not allowed to receive hazardous waste from the US or from any other foreign source without prior notification of arrival and consent from New Delhi.         
	The vessels arrival has also violated the Supreme Court order of October 14, 2003, that called for cleaning ships of all toxic materials before their import.         
	The Indian Platform on Ship-breaking, an umbrella organisation of environmental, health, labour and human rights activists, has decided to move court against the anchoring of the ship.         
	Gopal Krishna, representing the organisation, said the petition will seek to find out if the ship has complied with the Supreme Court order.        
	Krishna expressed disappointment that the central team had given a clean chit to the ship. He said the report was biased and, if approved by the Centre, it would set a wrong precedent for entry of such contaminated ships waiting to use Indian coasts for dismantling.        
	As of now, the Gujarat government does not even know who the owner of the vessel is, Krishna said.         
	Krishna said Global Marketing Systems (GMS), the last recorded owner of the ship, then registered as SS Oceanic, was penalised in the US for exporting the vessel as scrap without prior removal of toxins.         
	Krishna said the company is owned by one Anil Sharma, the NRI brother of Komal Sharma, the Bhavnagar businessman who is the contractual owner of Platinum II.         
	Komal Sharma claimed he bought the ship from a Greek owner whose identity he does not remember. The Bhavnagar businessman says he is the contractual buyer, which means he has not yet paid for the ship and will do so only if it is beached at Alang.

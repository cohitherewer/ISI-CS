                                                                                                               City-born man killed in UK
          AMIT ROY                          Ekram ul Haque                                   
	London, Sept. 7: A 67-year-old Indian, who came to the UK from Bengal, died today following a vicious attack on him in south London on August 31, Scotland Yard told The Telegraph tonight.        
	We are treating this murder though we will know the exact charges when five men appear in court tomorrow, the Scotland Yard spokesperson added.        
	Ekram ul Haque was attacked in Tooting, a generally peaceful area of south London with a mixed Indian-Pakistani population.        
	Haque was born in Calcutta. He moved to Belfast in search of work in 1972. There he met his wife and they moved to London in the early 1980s.        
	He was battered to the ground in front of his five-year-old granddaughter Marian, according to police. She was able to give the police a detailed account of the incident.        
	The police said that a 14-year-old boy appeared at Sutton Youth Court today, charged with conspiracy to commit grievous body harm (GBH); and GBH with intent on a 67-year-old man on August 31 in Church Lane, Tooting.         
	He was also charged with two counts of actual bodily harm on men in their forties and seventies, and attempted GBH on two pensioners on August 26 in the Tooting area. He has been remanded in custody.        
	A total of five youths have appeared in court accused variously in connection with this alleged incident  three of them are accused of GBH on Haque.        
	Detailed charges will follow after a post mortem is concluded.        
	According to todays Daily Mail, police are linking the attack to other assaults on elderly Asians. The attackers, who were black and wore hooded tops, are believed to be as young as 12. Mr Haque, a devout Muslim, was ambushed as he left his local mosque, where he had been attending evening prayers during the holy month of Ramadan.        
	The paper said: As he and Marian waited for a lift, the gang ran up behind him and clubbed him around the head. Two other worshippers chased the thugs away but Mr Haque  described by friends as a gentle giant  had suffered horrific head injuries.        
	His granddaughter has been left very shaken and disturbed, said her father, Mr Haques son Arfan. Graphic images of the attack were caught on CCTV.        
	The paper also said: Murder squad detectives have already begun investigating the attacks on him and four other Asians. Three of the earlier victims were also pensioners.         
	As local community tensions grew, police stepped up patrols near the Idara E. Jaaferiya mosque where Mr Haque was attacked last Monday. Arfan, a consumer law advisor, described the attack on his father as mindless violence but urged people to remain calm.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Patna, Sept. 3: Three elderly women were killed and at least 50 people were injured in a stampede that took place at a temple on top of the Barabar hill in central Bihars Jehanabad, 85km from here today.        
	Jehanabad sub-divisional officer Anjani Kumar Sinha who was on duty at the site when the stampede occurred said that the incident happened as hundreds of Hindu devotees were offering their prayers to Siddharth on the occasion of anant chaturdashi festival.         
	It was around 3.30am and hordes were climbing up and coming down the hill using an ancient railing. A rumour spread that the railing had broken in parts, said the SDPO, adding: People panicked and begun to push their way down.         
	Security deployed around the temple were too less to control the frightened mob. The incident left three women dead on the spot and 50 others injured.         
	Residents complained that the problem was made more serious by poor lighting which made visibility very low at the hill top and on the way.         
	Additional director-general (headquarters) Neelmani said that the injured have been admitted to Jehanabad Sadar hospital and two medical teams have been sent at the accident site as well to the hospital to aid treatment.         
	Jehanabad magistrate Palka Sahni confirmed that several patients were badly wounded. Those wounded are undergoing treatment and will be shifted to the orthopaedic wards of hospitals in Patna and Gaya, if local doctors feel the need for it.        
	The chief minister has asked the state chief secretary to probe into the incident and has announced a compensation of Rs 1.5 lakh to the kin of the three victims.

                                                                                                               Parties begin Jai Ho jibes
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Patna, March 4: Congresss decision to adopt A.R. Rahmans Oscar winning song, Jai Ho, as its election tagline has led to jeers in NDA circles.        
	Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar believes that Jai Ho will lead to Chhai Ho (wipe out) for the Congress.         
	The way the feel-good factor played a role in destroying BJP-led NDAs ambitions in 2004, Jai Ho will obliterate Congresss hopes, he said. For once Nitish and has indirectly joined hands with the Gujarat chief minister, Narendra Modi, who poked fun at Congress and its Slumdog Millionaire connection at a rally on Tuesday.         
	Modi said the Congress should receive an Oscar since it was under the partys rule that slums mushroomed in the country. If Congress had not been around, slums would not have been there. If slums had not existed there would not be any slumdogs and consequently the movie would not have been made. So, the Oscar should go to the Congress, said Modi.        
	Nitish, believes Jai Ho would eventually doom Congress. Leaders such as Venkaiah Naidu and Pramod Mahajan, suffering from the feel-good factor, had claimed that BJP alone would win 350 Lok Sabha seats. But after the 2004 the NDA fell on its face, he said.        
	The Congress will use Jai Ho to reach out to the people to convey that its regime has been a saga of hope for the aam aadmi. But, Nitish believes that the electorate would judge parties on the basis of their promises and performances.         
	He said his party would field its candidates in other states including Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, the Northeast and in Jharkhand, besides Bihar. The chief minister, however, did not clear if the JD(U) would enter the poll fray with the BJP in other states other than Bihar.        
	The announcement of Lok Sabha polls has triggered a war of words among parties locked in the poll arena.         
	Prior to Nitish Kumar ridiculing the Congresss Jai Ho campaign, RJD boss, a master in coining repartee, described the BJP as Bharat Jalao Party.         
	The BJP stands for Bharat jalao party as Advanis men believe in burning anything that actually symbolises Bharat (India), he said, adding: The BJP also believes in torching ideals of secularism along with cultural monuments.

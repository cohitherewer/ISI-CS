The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CPI holds big brother to ransom 
                                                                                                               CPI holds big brother to ransom 
  - Tussle over seat sours   30-year ties in Kerala        OUR BUREAU                                          
	March 13: The Left was scrambling to save its three-decade-old coalition in Kerala today after the CPI threatened to walk out of the Left Democratic Front blaming the CPMs overbearing attitude over seat-sharing.        
	The threat by CPI state secretary Veliyam Bharghavan, made at a televised news conference, belied the Lefts image as a disciplined coalition  ironically, a day after a warring Opposition stitched an alliance in the Lefts other bastion, Bengal.        
	Bhargavan said if it comes to the crunch, the CPI might contest 18 of Keralas 20 Lok Sabha seats, leaving the other two for front allies Janata Dal (Secular) and Kerala Congress (Joseph).        
	We may lose, he added, but without us the CPM will lose all 18 seats.        
	CPM state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan, whom Bhargavan named as the man alone responsible for the fronts impending collapse, went on air to counter the charges. But he also seemed to provide a flicker of hope, conceding the CPI has a share of four seats including Ponnani, the root of the dispute.        
	The CPI and the CPM had agreed that a Left-backed Independent, rather than a hardcore communist, would be a better choice to try and defeat the Muslim League in its stronghold of Ponnani.        
	But while the CPI insisted it should be allowed to choose the candidate, since it has been contesting the seat since 1984, the CPM went ahead and named Hussein Randathani.        
	According to the CPMs calculations, fielding Randathani can get it the votes of an influential Muslim outfit, the Peoples Democratic Party, all over the state. The PDP is well disposed towards Randathani.        
	Bhargavan said: The CPM leadership has lost its sense of balance and doesnt show basic courtesy. He said Vijayans candidate (Randathani) had already begun campaigning in Ponnani while the CPIs nominee, Canara Bank official A.P. Kunhamu, had not.        
	CPI national secretary D. Raja met CPM general secretary Prakash Karat as part of efforts to defuse the crisis. Raja told The Telegraph that Karat agreed that the CPI had a share of four seats in Kerala.        
	Ramachandran Kadannapalli, a leader of LDF partner Congress (S), is among those trying to broker peace. Some sources said a settlement could take place by March 16, when the CPI state council meets, perhaps in the form of a new candidate replacing Randathani and Kunhamu.        
	Vijayan, while hitting out at the CPI, said: The front is still a reality, and issues can be sorted out through discussions.        
	Raja said: We have not created any problem. The seat was traditionally with us, so its proper that we have a say in candidate selection. How can other parties impose any candidate in our seat?        
	The CPM central leadership hoped the issue would be resolved amicably.        
	Bhargavan today argued that no party could single-handedly defeat the Congress-led United Democratic Front, and recalled how the CPI and the CPM had both lost heavily when they fought each other in 1965 and 1970.        
	The CPI stand has spurred the Janata Dal (Secular) too to challenge the CPM, which has been eyeing the Kozhikode seat. The JD-S has declared it would not surrender Kozhikode even in exchange for another seat, Wayanad.        
	The CPM-CPI tussle has also encouraged PDP chairman Abdul Nasser Madhani to wade in, threatening to put up his own candidate from Ponnani if the LDF puts up a CPI nominee.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Srinagar, March 8: An anti-terror court has jailed a militant for life for a 19-year-old murder that was blamed on security forces  the killing of the father of Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq.        
	Hizbul Mujahideen commander Mohammad Ayub Dar was convicted and sentenced yesterday based on his alleged confession, but separatists criticised the Jammu Tada courts judgment saying Dars statement had been forced out of him.        
	The 1990 murder of Mirwaiz Mohammad Farooq, a prominent separatist leader, had triggered one of the worst anti-India agitations in Kashmir.         
	The separatists were quick to accuse the security forces of the killing. When the forces later fired on the funeral crowd and left dozens dead, the ordinary Kashmiris suspicions were reinforced.        
	This led to further protests, curfews and strikes that paralysed Kashmir for a long time and forced New Delhi to recall governor Jagmohan.        
	Dar and two other militants, Abdul Rehman Shingan and Zahoor Ahmed, had arrived at the victims home armed with pistols on May 21, 1990, the CBI chargesheet says.        
	Zahoor alias Bilal entered the Mirwaizs room and shot him while Dar and Shingan took position in the room of his personal assistant.        
	The chargesheet accused five Hizbul commanders of the assassination, including the outfits then chief Mohammad Abdullah Bangroo.        
	Bangroo and Shingan were later killed in encounters while Zahoor and the fifth accused, Javed Bhat, went into hiding. Bangroo and the Mirwaiz are buried in the same graveyard in Srinagar.        
	Dar was arrested in the early 1990s and spent several years behind bars. He was on bail when the judgment was pronounced.        
	The court ruled that Dar had made his confession voluntarily and that it did not require corroboration.        
	Mirwaiz Umar Farooq could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.

	New Delhi, Nov. 29: Border Security Force sources claim they recently spotted four new Pakistani bunkers on the Wagah border with what appeared to be a design flaw.        
	None of them had any vents  meant for aiming and shooting  facing India.        
	When we asked our (Pakistani) counterparts in the sector why the bunkers had come up, they told us, They are not meant for you but for our guys, a senior BSF officer said, interpreting our guys to mean the Taliban.        
	Infrastructure is coming up on the border on the Pakistani side to contain the Taliban, BSF director-general Raman Srivastava confirmed.        
	Taliban militants are apparently coming out of their strongholds in Pakistans north and northwest, crossing the hinterland and attacking the Pakistani Rangers, BSF sources said.        
	Earlier, there had been claims from the Indian security forces about Taliban men crossing into India from Pakistan, but these reports were scaled down after they hit tourist flow into Kashmir.        
	The BSF sources said additional Rangers battalions had been deployed in Pakistans tribal areas and Swat valley to fight the Taliban, so security presence in the countrys eastern border was relatively thin  a fact the militants were taking advantage of.        
	Indian intelligence sources had claimed in October that a group of militants had taken over a Pakistani outpost on the Punjab border that the redeployment-hit Rangers had apparently abandoned temporarily.        
	BSF sources said that in July and September, three rockets fired from across the Wagah border had landed in India, but it was later discovered that a fourth too had been fired and actually hit a Rangers position.        
	Ballistic tests found out that the three rockets that had landed on the Indian side were unmarked, the sources said. They added that it was unclear who had fired them.        
	The ceasefire violation, I would say, is not very serious, nor that it has increased too much. There is no evidence of who fired the rockets. Even the Pakistani army is worried over this, Srivastava said.        
	A home ministry official said India favoured restraint on the border even while keeping a watch on militant infiltration.        
	The BSF marked its 44th anniversary today. The force has 159 battalions and 27 more will be added over the next four years.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 14: P. Chidambaram today promised to speed action against the 1984 riot accused, raising the possibility of the prosecution of Congress leaders Jagdish Tytler and Sajjan Kumar.        
	From the Rajya Sabha, the Union home minister advised Delhi Lt Governor Tejinder Khanna to sanction CBI prosecution in four riot cases before December 31.        
	He said the CBI had completed investigation or re-investigation in seven cases against three politicians. While one of them, the Congresss Dharamdas Shastri, is dead, Kumar and Tytler are still in active politics.        
	Neither was fielded in the 2009 Delhi Assembly polls, apparently as a fallout of a Sikh journalist hurling a shoe at Chidambaram for the lack of action on the 1984 kilings. I, as home minister, promise I will do the best to heal the wounds of the Sikh community, Chidambaram said.        
	He slammed the Sheila Dixit government for making bureaucratic excuses while failing to provide jobs to the victims families.        
	He said he would write to the chief ministers to disburse pending compensation, and asked Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Chhattisgarh to finish the process by December end.        
	Chidambaram cited how every police departmental inquiry had resulted in exoneration and added he was trying to find a way to punish retired personnel.        
	He was replying to a calling attention motion by Tarlochan Singh. S.S. Ahluwalia led a BJP walkout, terming the reply hopeless.

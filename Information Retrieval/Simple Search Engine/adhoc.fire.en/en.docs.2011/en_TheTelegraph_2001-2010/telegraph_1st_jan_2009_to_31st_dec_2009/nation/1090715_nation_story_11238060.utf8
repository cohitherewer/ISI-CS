The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Plain speak before handshake with Pak
                                                                                                               Plain speak before handshake with Pak
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                               
	Paris, July 14: India has outlined a crisp, though ambitious, wish list to Pakistan if dialogue is to be meaningful and go beyond being a photo opportunity when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh meets counterpart Yousaf Raza Gilani on the margins of the NAM summit at Sharm-al-Sheikh on Thursday.        
	The list is: Bring the guilty of Mumbai to justice, wind up the infrastructure of terror operating off Pakistani soil and prevent all terror attack on India by Pakistan-based operatives.         
	The Singh-Jilani meeting will happen as scheduled but whether it yields wine or vinegar would depend on New Delhis sense of how determined Islamabad is to meet Indias concerns. We are going to talk, sources said, but it is really for Pakistan to determine how meaningful those talks will be. If they are willing to address the terror issue, we have already said we are willing to meet them more than half the way.        
	As Prime Minister Singh concludes guest-of-honour ceremonials in France and heads for Egypt, sources made it plain that the terror issue was not linked to the Mumbai assault alone but concerned a whole range of Pakistan-inspired disruptive activities in India afore and aft.        
	We recognise they have taken some steps, the sources said, perhaps referring to the dossier handed over to the Indian high commission in Islamabad over the weekend, but we are not convinced it is enough. Pakistan really needs to convince us it is willing to act against the terror network operating from its soil.         
	Key to this, in the immediate, would be the Pakistani establishments attitude towards the Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, and Lashkar spearhead Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, alleged to have masterminded the Mumbai attack last November. The Indian conviction on the culpability of the likes of Saeed, in fact, is leaping ahead of legal or technical nitty-gritty and punishing against him is something India would consider an essential part of the demonstrable action New Delhi has been demanding.         
	Saeed is a big part of the infrastructure of terror, Pakistan is obliged to catch anybody who indulges in terror under their own laws, under the laws of any civilised society, the sources said.         
	There is no sense yet from the government on what it makes on the Pakistani dossier  we are still studying the papers, it will take time nor is there any elaboration on how and when exactly the first contacts with ISI boss Lt Gen Ahmed Shuja Pasha were established. Neither is it clear what sort of dialogue has taken place. Pasha has briefed Indian military attaches at the mission in Islamabad, but government sources remain tight-lipped on what he brought along and what the Indian response was.         
	But following that contact, there has been a palpable thrust on dialogue, perhaps in anticipation of US secretary of state Hillary Clintons visit to the subcontinent next week.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Assam offers IT land
                                                                                                               Assam offers IT land
  - Neighbour woos Infy, Wipro after Bengal trouble        A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Guwahati, Sept. 12: The Assam government today offered 100 acres each to Infosys and Wipro to build projects originally scheduled to come up in the scrapped IT township in Bengal.        
	Assam information technology minister Himanta Biswa Sarma told reporters here that the government was ready to give 100 acres each to the two companies to set up IT hubs in the state capital.        
	Since the Bengal government has rejected the projects of both companies because of land problems, Assam, being a neighbouring state, welcomes the firms. A high-level delegation of the state government will travel to Bangalore next week to meet the top brass of Infosys and Wipro, Sarma said.         
	The Bengal government had not rejected the projects but expressed inability to hand over land as promised because of the controversy that followed the Vedic Village flare-up.        
	The Assam delegation will be led by IT commissioner V.S. Bhaskar.        
	Sarma said the government had identified plots along a national highway close to the Lokapriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport.        
	Sarma said the government had already acquired 100 acres and was in the process of acquiring the remaining 100 acres. He, however, did not say whether the plots would be contiguous.        
	The state government has already acquired 100 acres of land near LGB International Airport for an IT park. We are going to acquire another 100 acres soon. If Wipro and Infosys come to the state, the government will go the extra mile to provide all kinds of support to them to successfully execute the project, the minister added.        
	Ironically, the ministers offer comes within days of farmers rising in protest against the Assam governments move to acquire farmland on the outskirts of the city for a project by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).        
	Chief minister Tarun Gogoi had been wooing IT leaders like S. Ramadorai of Tata Consultancy Services, N.R. Narayana Murthy of Infosys and Azim Premji over the past few years.        
	Murthy, however, had told Gogoi that unless a five-star hotel was set up in Guwahati, the chances of IT companies going to the state were bleak.         
	 Two five-star hotels will also be ready in the city by the time the IT companies complete their project. Power supply will not be a problem and captive power stations will be created for the IT projects, Sarma said.        
	The minister said he too would go to Bangalore to meet Murthy and Premji next month to convince them.

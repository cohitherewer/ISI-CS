The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Fear keeps voters indoors
                                                                                                               Fear keeps voters indoors
  - Two landmine blasts in Jamui          GAUTAM SARKAR                                    
	Jamui (Bihar), April 16: The day that began in Jamui with hope, soon turned bitter as several residents were unable to cast votes  due to the Maoist threat and lack of planning by the administration.         
	The mood was apparent as Binod Sadha, 35, a resident of Bangalwa village of Bhimbandh block (Munger) under Jamui Lok Sabha seat, spoke against a rubbish government and rubbish Maoists preferring to stay indoors.        
	Sadha, along with 116 men and 114 women of his village, stayed away from voting.        
	The reason: Their Bhimbandh booth number-204 was shifted to Kunda, 5km from the village. The distance was not the problem, but we were afraid that we would be attacked, the man said.        
	Similarly, voters of booth number-17 set up at a Gurmaha forest resthouse boycotted polls after their station was shifted 23km away in Kukurjhap. How we can cover such a distance through Naxalite territory, a villager claimed. We have been here since early morning, but, so far, not a single vote has been cast, said polling personnel Binod Kumar around 1.30pm.        
	Jamuis district magistratecum-RO Prem Singh Meena confirmed that 16 Jamui booths were shifted, keeping in mind the red threat. However, he confirmed that despite some discrepancies, the urban pockets witnessed 40 per cent voting, while in rural areas 30-35 per cent votes were cast.         
	Booth personnel blamed the poor turnout to the absence of police force. A polling party of booth number-92 of Charkapatthar Baratard, on their way to Jamui with EVMs after poll, was attacked around 3.30pm by Maoists. Polling concluded early (at 3pm) in rebel-hit Jhajha, Chakai and Sikendara Assembly segments.         
	Till this report was filed, a gun battle was on between Maoists and Indo-Tibetan border police, who were escorting a polling party, said Jamui police. Sources said the party was still trapped. Since the area is inaccessible we dont have any information. Despite the presence of choppers, we have been unable to take their service. The Maoists are carrying sophisticated weaponry, including rocket launchers, that can easily destroy choppers, said a police officer on condition of anonymity.         
	Naxalites targeted Jamui district president of JD(U), Shambhu Sharan with a landmine explosion near Ghorparan on Narganjo-Simultala road. Sharan, with three associates, narrowly escaped death, but sustained injuries. The vehicle in which they were travelling was damaged.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 12: Governor M.C. Bhandare reviewed documents and video recordings of yesterdays voice vote after the Opposition Congress and the BJP accused Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik of manipulating rules to win the trust motion.        
	The scrutiny came amid speculation that the governor might order a fresh vote or recommend Presidents rule that both the Congress and the BJP  which withdrew support to Patnaiks ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD) last Saturday  have demanded.        
	However, Raj Bhavan sources would only say that Bhandare had seen the clippings even as the governor summoned Speaker K.K. Mohanty to brief him on the Assembly proceedings that saw the 61-member BJD cruise past the majority mark of 74.        
	I briefed him about the conduct of the business and clarified the position, the BJD leader said after the meeting last evening.        
	Today, the governor discussed the matter with state advocate-general B.K. Mohanty for over an hour.         
	Yesterday, delegations from the Congress and the BJP met the governor separately to protest against the Speakers decision to go for a voice vote instead of a division.        
	Congress legislature party deputy leader Narasingha Mishra said the Speaker ignored calls for a division  or voting through slips or by electronic machines. I had demanded division of votes. But the Speaker did not pay any heed, Mishra said.        
	Mohanty, however, insisted the Opposition had not demanded division. The Speaker also rejected two petitions for disqualifying three BJP rebels who had switched sides.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lalit threat to relocate IPL games
                                                                                                               Lalit threat to relocate IPL games
          OUR BUREAU                          Modi in Mumbai. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai/Jaipur, Feb. 16: Ringed by police complaints in Rajasthan, Indian Premier League boss Lalit Modi today threatened to shift tournament matches from Jaipur if the political witch-hunt did not end.        
	Modi, considered close to vanquished BJP chief minister Vasundhara Raje, has been confronted with several cases since the new Congress regime of Ashok Gehlot came to power. The IPL chairman now faces lawsuits relating to fraud and misappropriation of funds. He obtained anticipatory bail last week from Bombay High Court in a forgery case.        
	Terming the allegations politically motivated, Modi took on a belligerent stance today and threatened to move out games from Jaipur, the home ground of last years champions Rajasthan Royals, partially owned by actress Shilpa Shetty.         
	It is going to deter the IPL management from staging matches (in Jaipur). The governing council has already taken a decision authorising me to decide whether we should hold matches anywhere, whether its one place or x, y, z, Modi told reporters in Mumbai.        
	His threat to pull out Rajasthan Royals games from Jaipur is a reiteration of his announcement at the end of the IPL governing council meeting in Goa on the eve of the February 6 player auctions.        
	The option to move matches (out of Jaipur) is available to us. We are looking at alternative venues without doubt. If any government anywhere is going to deter the IPL management from staging matches we will take away those matches and hold them elsewhere, Modi said.        
	Ahmedabad tops the list of possible venues that Rajasthan Royals may opt for.         
	Rajasthan Royals officials refused comment.        
	Sources said in case Modi implemented his threat, it would not impact the earnings of the team much. IPL franchisees have multiple revenue streams like team sponsorships and ground sponsorships that are not dependent on home-ground advantage.        
	The only way revenues can be affected is through a possible fall in gate revenues. But it would be nave to think that people in Ahmedabad will not be interested in watching a Rajasthan Royals match just because they do not represent Gujarat. IPL is popular and whether in Ahmedabad or Jaipur, large crowds will be a given, an IPL source said.        
	The cricket czars aggressive posturing came a day after a police complaint accused him of fraud, saying a promised donation of Rs 6 crore for Jaipur blast victims had never reached the chief ministers relief fund.         
	Modi rebutted the charges, saying the money was promised by IPL franchisees and sponsors and that Rs. 5.2 crore had already been deposited in the relief fund.        
	Rajasthan cricket officials, locked in a tussle to depose Modi as Rajasthan Cricket Association president, said his threats were in tune with his dictatorial nature.        
	Arch rival Kishore Rungta said: By his threats, Modi is literally holding the government at gunpoint. In what authority is he issuing the threats?

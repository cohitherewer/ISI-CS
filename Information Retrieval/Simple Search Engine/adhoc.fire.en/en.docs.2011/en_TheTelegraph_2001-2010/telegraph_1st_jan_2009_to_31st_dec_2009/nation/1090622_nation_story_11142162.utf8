The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Foreign lawyers wont hurt: Moily 
                                                                                                               Foreign lawyers wont hurt: Moily

	New Delhi, June 21: Law minister Veerappa Moily believes that Indian lawyers will not lose out if foreign lawyers and firms are allowed to work in India.        
	However, the quality of legal education in the country would have to be upgraded first, Moily told The Telegraph in an interview.        
	Once our lawyers are trained to be the best they can capture the global legal market. Issues such as entry of foreign lawyers into India will then become irrelevant, he said. If I have my way, India will become the resource reservoir of the global legal fraternity.        
	Indian lawyers have opposed any move to open up the legal sector for fear of redundancy. They have urged the government to open up the sector, if at all, by degrees on a reciprocal basis  allow lawyers of a particular country to operate in India only if that country allows Indian lawyers to work in its courts.        
	Moilys strategy looks to allay Indian lawyers fears that they would be outperformed if foreign lawyers and firms enter the Indian market.        
	We will become world leaders in the legal field, like we are in IT, Moily said. Bangalore became an IT hub after the quality of engineering education was improved in Karnataka.        
	Moily also accepted that the high courts and the Supreme Court have too few judges from among women and the weaker castes.        
	There hasnt been proper social engineering in the higher judiciary, he said. In the days to come, this issue needs to be addressed.        
	He clarified that his ministry had no immediate plans to introduce reservations in the higher judiciary, and that nothing would be done without taking the judiciary into confidence.        
	Moily also spoke of the need to enforce accountability among judges and deal with corruption allegations. He referred to Justice Soumitra Sens case as a sample case which needed to be taken to its logical conclusion. Issues of corruption have to be dealt with firmly, he said.        
	Lalgarh charge        
	Moily criticised the Bengal government for the situation in Lalgarh.        
	The CPM has allowed its cadres to take the law into their own hands, he said. When theres no rule of law and people are treated differently, its only a matter of time before people take the law into their own hands and violence erupts.        
	He added: The aggrieved will always take the law into their own hands. That is what has happened in Lalgarh; thats what happened in Nandigram earlier. Police power should not be misused. Police should be allowed to function and carry on their normal duties.        
	Moily was also sceptical of the Gujarat government move to bring in a special law to deal with terror. The Centre has sent the legislation back asking for several changes.        
	How can we give such powers to a government that is suspect, Moily wondered. The police are not allowed to function (in Gujarat); they are used to fulfil the state governments political agenda.        
	He cited how the Supreme Court had ordered the special investigation team to probe the role of chief minister Narendra Modi in the 2002 riots.        
	You expect us to give these (special anti-terror) powers to such a government?

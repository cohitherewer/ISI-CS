	Cuttack, Feb. 16: Cuttack Development Authority (CDA) is all set to go the cyber way to improve public service and root out corruption.        
	With project e-CDA, the civic authority hopes to increase its functional efficiency and grievance-complaint monitoring system. CDAs functioning is also expected to be more transparent, organised, integrated and efficient, said an official.        
	The e-CDA project is an integrated solution that enables sharing a centralised database with all users.        
	Land acquisition and compensation payment, land allotment, transfer and cancellation, application and receipt processing, ground rent and licensing fee, plan approval and scheme details, enforcement, court case monitoring, grievance redress and complaint monitoring and other wings would be served by the same data base through a single-point entry.        
	The project has been implemented by National Informatics Centre (NIC).        
	NIC project nodal officer D.K. Mohanty said: Implementation of all the 16 modules in the project has been completed. They are intranet-based and web-enabled to help CDA in monitoring the activities and obtaining necessary information as and when required. All the services will be online within two to three days.        
	CDA officials said improvement in public service and grievances mechanism were expected to be one of the major benefits to follow with the start of e-governance. As every complaint would be uploaded at the time of filing and centrally monitored, the authorities would be able to check delays in rectification, officials said.        
	Besides, helping in reducing errors, saving time and labour the e-CDA project was also expected to eliminate corruption to a large extent, the officials said.        
	CDA has started developing Abhinava Bidanasi Kataka  a satellite township over nearly 1,900 acres reclaimed from the river belt of Kathajodi and Mahanadi to the southwest of Cuttack to accommodate about 30,000 residential units.        
	CDAs jurisdiction, however, spreads over Cuttack Municipal Corporation, Choudwar municipality and 20 other panchayats. Under the state housing and urban development department, CDAs specific functions include preparation and implementation of area development plans and projects for ensuring scientific land use patterns and working as a co-ordinator between government departments and other agencies involved in development activities.

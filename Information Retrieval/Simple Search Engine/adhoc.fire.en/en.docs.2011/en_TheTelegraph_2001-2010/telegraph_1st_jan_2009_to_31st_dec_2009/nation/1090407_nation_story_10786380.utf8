The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | No voter card? EC has given 13 options

	New Delhi, April 6: Thirteen types of ID proof will be accepted in place of voter identity cards, the Election Commission said today.        
	All such alternative ID documents must carry photographs and must have been issued before February 28 this year, the poll panel said. It had earlier declared that those who failed to produce electoral photo identity cards wouldnt be allowed to vote.        
	Ration cards, however, dont figure on the list, probably because they dont usually carry photos.        
	The panel has finished drawing up photo electoral rolls in all states and Union territories except Assam, Jammu and Kashmir and Nagaland.        
	Voters whose names are missing from the rolls but who have ID proof can approach booth officials, who can allow them to vote if convinced that they are genuine voters.        
	Among the documents allowed are passport, driving licence, PAN cards and I-cards issued by state and central PSUs, local bodies and public limited companies. Passbooks issued by public sector banks and post offices will be accepted and so will be property documents like pattas, registered deeds with photos, and SC/ST/OBC certificates.        
	Ex-servicemens pension books, pension payment orders, ex-servicemens widow or dependent certificates, and old-age and widow pension orders will also do fine, the poll panel said. The other items on the ID list are freedom fighters identity cards, arms licences and certificates issued to the physically challenged.        
	Job cards issued under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act will be good enough, as will be smart cards for the labour ministrys health insurance scheme, deputy election commissioner J.P. Prakash said. The head of a family may bring any of the alternative IDs and identify the other members, who may or may not have the documents, according to a poll panel statement.         
	Ad poser        
	Prakash said three sports ministry officials on the Commonwealth Games committee had been asked to explain why the money spent on newspaper ads shouldnt be recovered from them.         
	The ads, cleared by the government on February 20, were placed on March 20 after the model code came into force.        
	The Election Commission says there was enough time for the officials to assess whether their publication would be proper.

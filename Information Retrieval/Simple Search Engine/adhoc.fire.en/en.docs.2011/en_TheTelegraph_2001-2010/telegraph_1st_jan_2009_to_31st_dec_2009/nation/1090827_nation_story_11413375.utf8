                                                                                                               Theft and quit cry open up Tirupati fissures
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, Aug. 26: The theft of a Tirupati temple necklace has brought to the fore simmering differences in the shrine board with seven of its 13 members threatening to quit over the chairmans alleged dictatorial ways.        
	The quit cry comes after the Andhra government, which nominates all members to the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD), took serious note of the theft, by the head priest of the temple.         
	Executive officer I.Y.R Krishna was asked to explain the lapses and told to tighten the administration. The seven who have offered to quit allege chairman D.K. Adikeshavulu is authoritarian and doesnt bring matters to the board.        
	The theft has also opened a Pandoras box over the way in which the TTD manages its wealth  12 tonnes of gold and diamond jewellery, worth Rs 52,000 crore. In July, Andhra Pradesh High Court had directed the TTD to submit a list of gold and ornaments at all its 23 temples by September.        
	Bezwada Govinda Reddy, who had filed the petition, claimed he was offered Rs 10 crore to withdraw his petition.         
	According to Reddy, priest Ramana Dikshitulus theft of a 500gm necklace is only the tip of the iceberg. Dikshitulu is a small fry. My mission is to expose the big fishes who have flourished at Lord Venkateswaras expense, he said.        
	Reddy said he first suspected foul play four years ago when all officials suspended over a case of missing gold dollars  gold coins embossed with a picture of the deity  were brought back, allegedly after pressure from temple unions and intervention of bigwigs.         
	One of those reinstated still manages the treasury at the main temple in Tirumala, Reddy said.

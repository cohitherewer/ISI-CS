          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, May 22: The proportion of private school students failing their Class XII CBSE examinations has increased for the third year in a row, reinforcing concerns over the quality of fast mushrooming private institutions.         
	The trend of dipping pass percentage of students of private schools affiliated to Indias largest board presents a stark contrast with improving pass rates for all government-run schools.         
	As opposed to 82.35 per cent in 2006, the pass percentage for private school students dropped to 82.29 per cent in 2007 and 81.68 per cent in 2008. This year, the pass rate has dropped further to 80.92 per cent, according to the results released today morning.         
	In contrast, Kendriya Vidyalayas  central schools that form Indias largest school chain  improved their pass percentage from 91 per cent to 91.32 per cent.         
	Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas, central residential schools started under Rajiv Gandhis premiership, improved their pass rate from 92.44 to 94.09 per cent  the best performance for any school category.         
	Other schools run by state governments or municipal corporations improved their pass percentage from 81.96 per cent to 82.81 per cent.         
	The overall pass percentage has increase marginally from 80.91 per cent to 81 per cent.         
	Privately run schools account for around 70 per cent of all our schools today, according to government statistics, and a majority of them are affiliated to the CBSE. Students of private schools comprised just under 60 per cent of all students who appeared for the CBSE Class XII exams.         
	The dip for three consecutive years establishes a trend that is extremely worrying. Fast mushrooming private schools, over which we have little control, could be a key reason, a senior CBSE official said.         
	Educational institutions can be set up in India by registering as a society under the Societies Act. A school can then seek affiliation to a board of its choice  the CBSE, other national boards or state boards. The board concerned is required to ensure minimum quality of infrastructure and teaching in these schools before granting them affiliation. Boards enjoy the power to disaffiliate schools, too. But CBSE officials have long complained that they lack the infrastructure to monitor quality at schools on a regular basis.         
	As a consequence, a slip in standards is very hard for us to keep track of, unless we receive specific complaints, the CBSE official said.         
	The number of cases of unfair means intercepted by authorities has gone up from 49 to 58.

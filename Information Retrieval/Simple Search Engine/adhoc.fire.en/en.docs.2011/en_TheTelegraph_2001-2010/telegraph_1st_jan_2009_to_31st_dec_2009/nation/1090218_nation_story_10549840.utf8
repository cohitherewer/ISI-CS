	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 17: The states National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) has developed an Internet-based monitoring system to track drug requirement and disbursement in district and sub-district levels.        
	The system will help outline requirements, said health mission director Sushil Kumar Lohani.         
	The Procurement Management Information Systems, or proMIS as it has been christened, is based on a Tamil Nadu model. In the state it is being developed to computerise the complete procurement process  right from the planning stage to the final delivery.        
	proMIS aims to make the system more transparent, competitive, quick and complaint-free.         
	Also, the NRHM, through proMIS, aims to facilitate transfer of medicines from medicine-rich districts to medicine-poor districts.         
	As of now, proMIS has been piloted in three states  Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Orissa. While 30 districts have been selected in Orissa for the pilot project, only three have been selected in Madhya Pradesh and Orissa.         
	Latest updates on drugs and other essential items, including vaccines and malaria drugs received from the Centre and state government will be fed to the Internet and can be accessed by users possessing the password.         
	Users can get to know the exact stock position of any drugs.         
	Other plans include, the construction of as many as 35 drug warehouses in the district headquarters hospitals, three medical colleges and capital hospitals. Twenty-two of these warehouses have already been constructed.         
	A training programme for this purpose was today inaugurated at state drug management unit, here by the commissioner-cum-secretary of the health and family welfare department, Anu Garg, where around 60 participants received trained on the use of proMIS.

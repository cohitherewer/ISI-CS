          OUR BUREAU                               
	Guwahati/New Delhi, Nov. 4: Ulfa today appealed to the Bangladesh government to reveal the whereabouts of two of its senior leaders  foreign secretary Sasha Choudhury and finance secretary Chitrabon Hazarika.         
	The outfit claimed that the two leaders were abducted on Sunday night by unknown persons from a house in Sector 3 of Uttara in Dhaka.         
	An email purportedly written by the outfits military spokesperson Raju Barua  which was emailed to the media tonight  claimed that a group of seven to eight unknown persons in civil dress took away the two leaders.         
	The Ulfa leader hinted that the Indian forces might have abducted the two and appealed to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to take up the issue as a concern of sovereignty and security of Bangladesh. The outfit called upon Hasina to resolve the issue amicably with India, if the duo had indeed been abducted to the other side of the border.         
	Both Delhi and Assam police claimed ignorance.        
	Senior Assam police officers said they had no such information about any kidnapping of the Ulfa leaders. If there is anything, the Bangladesh government will inform Delhi, an official said.        
	Home ministry sources in New Delhi claimed that till now we have no knowledge of any such development.         
	However, the sources did confirm that Dhaka was going after senior functionaries of Indian insurgent outfits holed up in Bangladesh.         
	Barua said the abductors did not reveal their identities but claimed that they had been sent by some high authority in order to bring the two with them. The abductors searched the house and brought passports and voter ID cards along with them. It is suspected that both of them had been already handed over to India, the email said.         
	However, unlike on previous occasions, the mail was not sent on Ulfas official letter pad. While Sasha Choudhury hails from Helosa village in Nalbari, Chitrabon Hazarika is from Jakhalabandha in Nagaon.         
	The two are among the five remaining leaders in Ulfas top hierarchy, which also includes commander-in-chief Paresh Barua, chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa and Raju Barua.

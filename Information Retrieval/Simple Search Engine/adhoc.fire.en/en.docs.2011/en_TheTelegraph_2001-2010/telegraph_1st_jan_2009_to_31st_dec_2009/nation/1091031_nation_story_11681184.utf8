The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Red letter threatens to blow up Idco office
                                                                                                               Red letter threatens to blow up Idco office
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           In the shadow of fear                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 30: Officials at state-run Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (Idco) received a letter last evening that threatened to blow up Idco Towers, the firms office in the capital city.         
	The letter, purportedly written by CPI(Maoist), also threatened to harm finance minister Prafulla Ghadai. It was written in red ink and was addressed to Idco chairman and industries secretary Saurav Garg. Normally letters to Idco arrive through post. But this one was delivered by a man to the Idco diarist.         
	The man went missing right after delivering the letter, which was allegedly signed by a CPI(Maoist) member.        
	The letter alleged large-scale corruption in the Idco group.         
	Our organisation will not tolerate any kind of corruption. Idco has been providing land to relatives of finance minister at a cheap rate. Therefore, corrupt officials of the organisation who are facilitating the process will be punished. Idco chairman and industries secretary Saurav Garg will also have to face the consequences of his crimes, it read.         
	The letter also made a mention of roadside kiosk vendors being rendered homeless and unemployed, while corrupt officials and politicians went on a land purchasing spree spending lakhs on large tracts.         
	Idco managing director Srikant Kabi later intimated the matter to the state home department.        
	The police commissionerate refused to comment on the matter before probing the incident further. We have to verify whether the letter is authentic or a hoax first before we can take the next step, said an officer at Sahid Nagar police station. The letter that began with the phrase  lal salam  was a mix of Oriya, English and Telugu.        
	Maoists nabbed        
	Rayagada police arrested three Maoists during a combing operation in the area today.         
	The rebels, identified as Biripankar Sadanand Hikabadi, Purna Chandra Samputika and Anand Praska, were arrested early in the morning today from Rayagada, said superintendent of police Ashish Kumar Singh.         
	The trio are believed to have been involved in a number of crimes, including the attack on Dangasorada police outpost. We had kept a watch on them for sometime now, said Singh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Atal in appeal, Mahajan on mind
                                                                                                               Atal in appeal, Mahajan on mind
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 7: The BJP today put out an appeal by an ailing and out-of-sight Atal Bihari Vajpayee to perk up its low-key Maharashtra campaign, but many wished late Pramod Mahajan had been around for the battle.        
	Even a functionary of the RSS, many of whose members disliked Mahajans lifestyle and indulgences, admitted: Had he been there, he would have turned the BJP-Shiv Senas fortunes around.         
	Those in the BJP and the RSS who had initially opposed the candidature of Mahajans daughter Poonam, contesting her first election, have reportedly shed their reservations and are now working for her victory in Mumbais Ghatkopar (West). Our slogan is pay homage to Mahajans soul by voting Poonam, a source said.        
	Vajpayees appeal, released on his official letterhead, describes the election as both a challenge and an opportunity. We should accept the challenge and take advantage of the opportunity.... The people of Maharashtra have seen a BJP-Sena government in the past which gave top priority to development and the common mans security.        
	Sources said the BJP had to fall back on Vajpayee at the last moment because none of the top leaders, including L.K. Advani, was likely to have a big campaign impact. Only four days are left for the campaign to end.        
	Top state leaders Gopinath Munde and Nitin Gadkari are said to have sunk their differences but a source said neither had Mahajans skills. They lack Mahajans imagination to identify peoples issues and convert them into campaign themes, the source said.

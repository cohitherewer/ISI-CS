The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Riot cloud on elections
                                                                                                               Riot cloud on elections

	Raikia (Kandhamal), April 10: Bharat Bandh Digal does not look very enthusiastic about the elections though this region is going to the polls in less than a week.        
	How will the elections change our life? asked the 70-year-old, staying at Mandakia relief camp seven months after the August-September communal riots. Digal, a Christian by faith, said he was scared to go back home, as he would be forced to reconvert.        
	Asked whether he would vote at the relief camp for which arrangements have been made, he said unmindfully: I have not decided yet. Like Digal, 3,000-odd people are still in six relief camps at K. Nuagaon, Tikabali, Raikia and Udayagiri blocks, officials said. Several others had migrated to Bhubaneswar, Cuttack and other places following the riots.        
	Even those who had returned home were apprehensive about outbreak of fresh violence during the polls to be held on Thursday.         
	I dont know what will happen during the polls, said a visibly panicked Amar Singh Mandal of Mundigarh village under Tumudibandh block, where VHP leader Swami Laxmananda Saraswati and four of his associates were killed sparking widespread anti-Christian violence that claimed 38 lives.        
	In view of these apprehensions, Cuttack-Bhubaneswar diocese archbishop Raphael Cheenath had last week urged the Election Commission to postpone polls in Kandhamal stating that the situation in the region was still very tense and abnormal.        
	However, Swarupananda Patra, a Christian leader and president of Orissa Secular Forum, does not agree with the demand for poll postponement in Kandhamal. The riot-hit people of Kandhamal should not shy away from polls. Its time they should wake up and come back to mainstream life, said Patra, adding that he had persuaded the minority people to participate in the polls.         
	BJP has openly announced that the issues of religious conversion and the murder of the monk would be its major electoral plank. Of course, this will be the major issue in Kandhamal, said state Hindu Jagaran Samukhya president Ashok Sahu, who is also the BJP candidate from Kandhamal Lok Sabha seat.        
	Incidentally, Manoj Pradhan, the prime accused in the riots with over a dozen cases registered against him and now lodged in jail, is contesting as BJP nominee from communally sensitive G. Udaygiri Assembly seat.         
	His Congress rival and sitting MLA Ajayanti Pradhan alleged that Pradhans supporters had been threatening people to vote for the BJP. However, the local BJP leaders denied such claims.        
	Today, chief minister Naveen Patnaik criticised the BJP for its communal agenda during his whirlwind tour to the district. Incidentally, the BJD has fielded Loksuna Majhi, a Christian, as its nominee from G. Udaygiri.

	Bangalore, Sept. 6 (PTI): Key scientists from the country and abroad who designed the 11 payloads  scientific instruments  on board the Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft will meet here tomorrow for a technical review.        
	Of the 11 payloads, five were designed and developed in India and three by the European Space Agency. Two were from the US and one from Bulgaria.        
	If some of them have got some preliminary findings, we will try to make an assessment, Isro chairman G. Madhavan Nair said.         
	According to the space agency, 95 per cent of the objectives of the mission have been completed. Isro had planned to take up the remaining work in the next season, starting October. But last week, the mission, expected to last two years, met with a premature end.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Judge springs gobble threat
                                                                                                               Judge springs gobble threat
                            
	New Delhi, June 1: Judges may not be emperors, but they sure are tigers. So believes Justice Markandey Katju of the Supreme Court, who recently rapped senior counsel Mukul Rohtagi for forgetting protocol and warned lawyers against messing with judges.        
	Rohtagi, seeking a stay on a Delhi High Court order, had insisted the bench of Justices Katju and Deepak Verma has to hear the matter.        
	You cannot tell us it has to be heard, Justice Katju retorted, launching into a morality tale. A man, he said, boasted to a friend that his father had fought a tiger. When the friend asked what happened after that, the man said the tiger gobbled up his father.        
	If you fight with a judge youll be gobbled up. So, dont fight with a judge, Justice Katju said. The hapless Rohtagi said: I humbly request Your Lordships.        
	The Bar Council has done away with the colonial practice of addressing judges as My Lord or Your Lordship but Rohtagi was probably too shaken.        
	Judges who step beyond their jurisdiction havent escaped Justice Katjus lash either. Only last week he had accused some of behaving like emperors after Orissa High Court raised the marks of six medical entrance examinees.        
	But he scolded the lawyers too: You think you can make the judiciary do anything.        
	Nor has he shown any patience for lawyers clever turns of phrase. When a counsel said the illegal sacking of his client from a banks board was a virtual civil death for him, the judge shot back: Arrey bhai, how can there be a civil death for your client? Only sanyasis have it. Once they renounce material life, they perform their own funeral, indicating their civil death.                    WRITTEN WITH A PTI REPORT

	Kuala Lumpur, Jan. 1 (PTI): An Indian oil tanker with 40 crew members narrowly escaped the clutches of Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden today.        
	The heavily armed pirates on two speedboats opened fire on the loaded, mid-sized tanker heading towards the Suez Canal this morning but sped away after a Malaysian navy frigate sent a helicopter, preventing the Indian ship from becoming the first victim of Somali pirates in 2009.

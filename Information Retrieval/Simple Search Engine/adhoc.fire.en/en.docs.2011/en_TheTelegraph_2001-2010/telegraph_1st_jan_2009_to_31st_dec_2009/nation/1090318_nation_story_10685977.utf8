The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | UGC leash on prospectus fee 
                                                                                                               UGC leash on prospectus fee 
  - Watchdog rap for unwanted burden         CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                     
	New Delhi, March 17: The University Grants Commission plans to centrally regulate the exploitative cost of prospectuses universities and other higher educational institutions ask aspiring students to buy.         
	The regulations on the cost of admission forms and the prospectus will be binding on both government and private institutions, the UGC has written to all vice-chancellors and heads of deemed universities.         
	This will be the first occasion when the Centre will directly intervene to decide how much individual institutions can charge for admission forms and their prospectus.         
	A high prospectus fee can block the entry of a prospective student even before he seeks admission. It is an entry-level road block which must be removed, a top UGC official said.         
	The decision, the letter states, was taken after the UGC received several complaints against institutions, especially deemed universities belonging to the private sector.         
	It has been observed, that some of the deemed universities, particularly those belonging to the private sector, are charging exorbitant charges as price of the prospectus for admission to various courses, the letter says.         
	The letter also criticises the practice of several institutions of asking students to buy a different prospectus for each course they apply to. This practice is an unwanted burden on the students who have to waste a lot of time and money in entrance examinations, the letter says.         
	The UGC has asked all vice-chancellors and heads of institutions to send their comments on the proposed regulations.         
	UGC sources said the regulations were likely to be enforced by the start of the 2009 academic session.         
	The letter comes in the wake of protests by students at Jawaharlal Nehru University against a hike in the cost of the prospectus this year.         
	After days of protest, five students, including the union president, were rusticated for allegedly obstructing the admission procedure.         
	But it only angered protesters further, triggering a hunger strike by students at the entrance of the JNU administrations headquarters.         
	The university finally agreed to set up a committee to examine their grievances, successfully convincing the students to call off their hunger strike. The university is, however, yet to roll back the hike in prospectus cost.         
	The union had argued that the hike would act as an impediment for students from economically weak backgrounds seeking admission.         
	The UGC letter is, however, silent on a long-pending proposal to regulate admissions and fees charged by private deemed universities, that has repeatedly been opposed by private institutions as violative of their rights.         
	Private institutions, including minority-run ones, have also threatened to legally challenge the UGC if it regulates the fee they charge.

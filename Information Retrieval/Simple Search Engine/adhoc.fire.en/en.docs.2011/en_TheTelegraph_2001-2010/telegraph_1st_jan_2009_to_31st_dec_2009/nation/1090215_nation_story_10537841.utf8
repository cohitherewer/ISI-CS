          OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES                          Haider with sister Ensha after being assaulted by Bajrang Dal activists at Vikram University in Ujjain on Saturday. (PTI)                                  
	Feb. 14: Pramod Mutalik may be in custody but several Mutaliks have surfaced across India, in many garbs.         
	Siblings and friends mistaken for lovers and thrashed, faces of cuddling lovebirds blackened, couples having a cosy time married off: Youngistan India battled it out with moral vigilantes, some in khaki, others wearing saffron on their sleeves.        
	Young India icon Rahul Gandhi said today he didnt believe in Valentines Day, but had no problem with people celebrating it.         
	Others across the political and official spectrum werent as magnanimous.        
	In Madhya Pradeshs Ujjain, overzealous Bajrang Dal activists attacked Haider and his elder sister Ensha at Vikram University.         
	Haider, a student of Class IX, had gone along with Ensha, a first-year arts student, to the university and was mistaken for her boyfriend by the Bajrang supporters.         
	They gave Haider a severe thrashing and stopped only after Ensha began screaming that she was his elder sister and eight years older.        
	A police complaint was registered, but that did not deter the Bajrang activists from taking out a victory march.         
	Haryana found its Mutalik in the garb of a man in khaki: sub-inspector Mola Ram, who beat up a boy and a girl in Jind on Thursday on the pretext that they were indulging in adultery.        
	The two, students of a local college and in their early twenties, were thrashed and dragged over a kilometre by Ram to a police station where they were detained for nearly five hours before being released.        
	The girl was slapped and dragged by the hair by Ram, who was suspended today.         
	Local people who witnessed the incident said the two were sitting inside a friends room at Rohtak Road colony in Jind. The friend had left to fetch some refreshments when someone spotted them, bolted the door from outside and informed the police, said Devinder, a resident.        
	The city of the Taj  the worlds most famous monument to love  was not spared either.         
	Agra police arrested six Shiv Sena workers for attacking and cutting the hair of three couples at a park near the marble mausoleum.        
	Sena cadres were particularly active in Pune, where they forced two couples to exchange garlands in a symbolic marriage.        
	In Jaipur, couples preferred to stay indoors rather than risk becoming easy targets of moral policing.         
	The Central Park, a popular hangout for couples, remained deserted while other upmarket locations saw thin crowds.        
	Amit and Seema, a couple who usually hang out at Gaurav Towers every other day, said: We are not afraid of so-called moral policing and know they are mostly hooligans. But it is always better to avoid such people and awkward situations.        
	V-Day celebrations in Karnataka, where the Sri Ram Sena launched its wave of spite, were trouble-free. However, most malls in Bangalore and Mangalore kept the celebrations low-key and refrained from lining up too many special events.

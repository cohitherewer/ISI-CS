The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Police outside, partners at ease
                                                                                                               Police outside, partners at ease
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, July 2: Running his long nails through his streaked hair, market trader Atul Kumar looked up cautiously as two policemen standing nearby watched the celebrations outside Delhi High Court over the order decriminalising consensual, adult gay sex in private.        
	Seeing the concerned look in Atuls eyes, his partner Manish Tripathi tapped him on the shoulder. Relax. Theyre just here to manage the crowd. They cant hurt us any more. Were no longer criminals, he said.        
	Atul belongs to the transgender community  he was born male but identifies himself as a woman. Manish, his partner, is bisexual. Their parents, they said, had accepted and, in Atuls case, even supported their sexual inclinations.         
	Todays order means the law has now accepted them.        
	Two years ago, when the couple wanted to rent an apartment in south Delhi, they were repeatedly refused.        
	We were abused in some instances. On other occasions, people passed snide remarks. Even people who we thought were more liberal came up with arguments to refuse us once they saw me, said Atul.        
	The couple eventually gave up on looking jointly for a home. Manish rented an apartment, but neighbours objected to Atul visiting Manish. They complained to the landlady and warned her the police would harass her too if they found out about her tenant and his partner, Manish recalled.         
	In June last year, the landlady asked Manish to leave. He rented a fresh apartment.         
	But Atul would only visit after covering his face, or late at night when no one was watching. And we had to be very discreet in our intimacy. Basically, we were forced to hide ourselves, even in my own home, Manish said.        
	With the high court upholding the right of adult members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community to consensual sexual activity in private, the couple plan to use the order to regain their own space.

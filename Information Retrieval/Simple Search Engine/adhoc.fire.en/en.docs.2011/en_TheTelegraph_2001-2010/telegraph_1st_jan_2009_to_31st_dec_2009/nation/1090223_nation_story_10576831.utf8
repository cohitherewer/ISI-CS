	Sambalpur, Feb. 22: Fifteen members of a wedding party, including the bride, were killed and two others were injured today when the Mahindra Bolero they were travelling in collided with an express train at an unmanned level crossing at Dhanger, 60km from here.

	Fifteen people, including seven women and a child, were killed in the accident that took place at 3.50pm.

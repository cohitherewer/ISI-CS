	New Delhi, Oct. 23: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh this evening flew into Thailand where he will hold talks with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao on the sidelines of an Asean summit tomorrow.        
	Singhs arrival coincided with confirmation by the Arunachal Pradesh government that the Dalai Lama would visit the state next month, a trip Beijing has questioned.        
	Singh, who flew into the Thai beach resort of Cha-Am Hua Hin for tomorrows India-Asean Summit and Sundays East Asia Summit, will discuss all issues of mutual interest, a senior external affairs ministry official said in Delhi.        
	But the focus of the meeting, the first between the two leaders since Beijing questioned Singhs recent visit to Arunachal, is likely to be Chinas claims to the state, which it dubs a disputed territory. Singh is expected to iterate Indias stand that Arunachal is an integral part of India.        
	In Itanagar, chief minister Dorjee Khandu, fresh from leading the Congress to a landslide win yesterday, said the Centre should firmly reject Chinas objections to the Dalai Lamas visit. The Government of India has clearly said the Dalai Lama can go anywhere in India. What China is claiming is meaningless and should be ignored.        
	Beijing had said this week that it was firmly opposed to the Tibetan spiritual leaders trip to the state. We firmly oppose the Dalai Lamas visit to the region, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Ma Zhaoxu had said.        
	Khandu had earlier snubbed Beijings claim to the state saying Arunachal was a part of India and that Chinas claim is an illegal one.        
	Speaking in New Delhi before his departure for Thailand, Singh pledged to deepen wide-ranging relations with East and Southeast Asia.         
	Indias enhanced engagement with Asean is at the heart of our Look East policy. The conclusion of the India-Asean trade-in-goods (free trade) agreement in August was a major first step in our objective of creating an India-Asean regional trade and investment area, he said.         
	With the free-trade agreement clinched, India and Asean are now looking at inking a similar pact in the field of services and investment.        
	The East Asia Summit brings together the Asean countries as well as Australia, New Zealand, India, China, Japan and South Korea. It will discuss the global economic slowdown, food security, energy and climate change.

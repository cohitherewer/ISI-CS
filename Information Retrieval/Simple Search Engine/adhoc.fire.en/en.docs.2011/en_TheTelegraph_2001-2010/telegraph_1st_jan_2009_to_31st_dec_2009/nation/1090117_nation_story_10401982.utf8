The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | One state, two lives for Mayas
                                                                                                               One state, two lives for Mayas
          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                          Meera with her baby who was named after Mayavati on Thursday. (Naeem Ansari)                                  
	Lucknow, Jan. 16: As one Mayavati celebrated her birthday amid her riches yesterday, 12 other Mayavatis cried through theirs, beginning a grim battle for survival against odds.        
	A dozen of the 40 girls born to poor parents yesterday in Lucknows five government hospitals were named after the chief minister, according to the civic bodys birth register.        
	Despite their VIP name, the babies enter an inhospitable world: Unicef said this week that the risk of child mortality was the highest in Uttar Pradesh among Indian states.        
	The naming trend, however, suggests the extortion and murder charges surrounding the chief ministers 53rd birthday celebrations have had little impact in the labour rooms, at least among the poor.        
	Hospital records said eight of the 12 below-poverty-line (BPL) families that named their girls Mayavati were Dalits. Two were from the Other Backward Classes and two were Muslim.        
	The trend continued today, with four of the 16 girls born this morning named after the Bahujan Samaj Party leader.        
	Sumanlata and Shabnam Khatoon became mothers and promptly named their baby girls Mayavati and Mayavati Bano. Sumanlata, a Dalit, said she adored the BSP leader for her boldness.        
	She is a star for Dalit families, the wife of Sampath Lal said at the Jhalkaribai government hospital. I persuaded my husband to name her Mayavati.        
	Shabnam, whose brother-in-law is a BSP leader, said she chose the Hindu name for her newborn in keeping with the chief ministers call for Dalit-Muslim unity.        
	Rani Chaudhary, 21, of Daliganj, however, said her mother-in-law had forced her to name her child after the chief minister.        
	An official of the state family planning department suggested that one possible reason for the rush to name girls Mayavati could be a scheme announced by the chief minister yesterday to try and stop families from killing their baby girls or female foetuses.        
	Mayavati declared that every girl born to a BPL family in the state, from January 15 onwards, would receive Rs 1 lakh from the government once she turned 18.        
	The chief minister, however, needs to do more to save the girls from untimely death, keeping in mind Unicefs statement that her state is the riskiest one for a woman to have a baby in India.        
	The report, State of the Worlds Children 2009, added that nearly a third of all maternal deaths in the country took place in Uttar Pradesh.        
	Unicef said a woman had a one-in-42 lifetime risk of maternal death in Uttar Pradesh compared with one in 500 in Kerala. It identified high birth rates, poor nutrition, limited access to reproductive health care and lack of birth spacing as the biggest dangers to the health of mothers and children in the state.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rebuffed, man jabs with HIV syringe
                                                                                                               Rebuffed, man jabs with HIV syringe
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, Jan. 1: A man injected his teenaged sister-in-law with HIV-positive blood for spurning his advances, apparently after buying the sample from gangs that stocked infected blood.        
	Plus II student Lalitha, 17, will not catch the infection because she was treated quickly, said Dr Hari Prasad at Guntur General Hospital where she is admitted.        
	The doctor said a clumsy jab in the back with a needle and syringe, which is what the girl received yesterday, would normally not result in infection if the victim was treated within a few hours.        
	C.D. Prabhakar, 30, an auto-rickshaw driver in Guntur town 400km from here, had attacked Lalitha as she stepped out of her coaching classes.        
	This was the third HIV-syringe attack in 10 days in Guntur district, which has one of the countrys highest HIV/AIDS rates. Sources said local criminal gangs secretly collected HIV-positive blood from pathology labs or HIV patients, and often used it as a threat after kidnapping people for ransom.        
	Prabhakar used to torture wife Padma because she had been childless after four years of marriage, and had recently sought Lalithas hand in marriage, police said. But his father-in-law Babu Rao, a vegetable vendor, and other community elders had rejected his proposal.        
	Prabhakar then beat up Padma, who ran away to her father. Rao filed a police complaint that put the auto driver behind bars for two weeks. After his release, Prabhakar began stalking Lalitha on her way to college, the police said.        
	I will ruin you even if I have to go to jail again, he allegedly screamed after yesterdays attack. But he later drank pesticide in his room. Prabhakar, said to be critical, has been charged with attempted culpable homicide and attempted suicide.        
	On December 22, a husband injected HIV-positive blood into his wife in a Guntur village when she refused to return home with him from her parents house. On December 26, a spurned man made a similar attack on a girl inside a high-school lab.        
	Guntur district has some 27,000 HIV patients. Some 3.5 per cent of its babies were born HIV-positive in 2005, a figure that has now fallen to 1.5 per cent. About 2 per cent of its population is infected.        
	Officials of the state AIDS control society said the district had 6,073 registered commercial sex workers, and an equal number of unregistered ones who escaped the mandatory HIV tests.

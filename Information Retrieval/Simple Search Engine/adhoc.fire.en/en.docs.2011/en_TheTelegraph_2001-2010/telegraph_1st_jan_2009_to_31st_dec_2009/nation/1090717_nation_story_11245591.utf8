The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Assembly bedlam over pay debate
                                                                                                               Assembly bedlam over pay debate
                            
	Patna, July 16 (PTI): Opposition MLAs belonging to RJD, Congress, LJP and Left parties today created an uproar in the Assembly and staged a walkout after their proposal for an adjournment motion on a debate on repression of schoolteachers appointed on contract was rejected.        
	Opposition members including RJDs deputy leader in the House Shakeel Ahmed Khan, LJPs Maheshwar Singh, Congresss Ashok Kumar, CPMs Ramdeo Verma and CPI-ML()s Arun Kumar moved the adjournment motion on alleged repression of newly appointed teachers on contract.        
	Seeking acceptance of the motion for a debate, Khan said the government should take immediate steps to regularise their services.        
	As Speaker Udai Narain Choudhary rejected the motion, Opposition MLAs got on their feet shouting anti-government slogans and demanding immediate resignation of Nitish Kumar.        
	Choudhary, however, stuck to his decision on the motion saying it was rejected as it was not in keeping with the rules.        
	After creating a din for a few minutes sloganeering Opposition members walked out of the House.        
	Weeks ago, the police had to resort to teargas shells and batons to disperse a mob comprising temporary schoolteachers who were demonstrating and demanding pay parity with permanent government teachers.         
	The mob also tried to force their way into the Vidhan Sabha premises on July 10.        
	Hundreds of schoolteachers, including women, appointed on a contract basis, fought a pitched battle with the police at the R Block roundabout close to the legislature complex a few weeks ago during their proposed siege of the Assembly to demand, among other things, the regularisation of services and pay parity.

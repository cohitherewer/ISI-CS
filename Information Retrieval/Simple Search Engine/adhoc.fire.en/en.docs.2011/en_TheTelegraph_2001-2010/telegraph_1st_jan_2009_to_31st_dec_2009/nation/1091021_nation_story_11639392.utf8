The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Realistic on China, PM seeks vigilance
                                                                                                               Realistic on China, PM seeks vigilance
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 20: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is understood to have told senior members of his cabinet and top military commanders that relations with China are complex and that building political trust to resolve disputes with Beijing would be a long-drawn process.        
	The Prime Minister was being quoted by an officer who took notes while he addressed the unified commanders conference  an annual event of the defence establishment  here today. The Prime Ministers words on relations with China were absent from the official text of the excerpts of his speech that was released to the media.        
	But the Prime Ministers views were eagerly heard by the senior commanders because of the immediate context in which they were uttered. Last week, Beijing objected to the Prime Ministers visit to Arunachal Pradesh  a territory China disputes  to campaign for the Assembly elections. China has also protested the Dalai Lamas visit to Tawang in Arunachal that is scheduled in November.        
	The Prime Minister is understood to have said that there was a process to build political trust to resolve border disputes. Till the two countries could reach common ground, he is said to have told the commanders, that it was important to be vigilant. He also said development works  referring to road and communication links in the border regions  needed to be continued.        
	In the officially released excerpts, the Prime Minister said the terrorist attack in Mumbai on November 26 last year confirmed our worst fears about the lethal dimensions of terrorism and non-traditional threats to our security.        
	He said terrorists were backed by foreign powers and there were also independent operators among them. We have, therefore, to improve our defensive mechanisms against all forms of terrorism, asymmetric warfare and aggravated militancy. We need to be prepared to face onslaughts of this kind, but we should avoid knee-jerk reactions, he said.        
	He said since 26/11  the terror attack on Mumbai  the Centre had tightened the security machinery and strengthened its intelligence-gathering network. Co-ordination between the Centre and the states had also increased.        
	Although there has been no major terrorist attack in India since then, there are regular intelligence reports of imminent attacks in the country. This is a matter of deep concern, and there is no room for complacency. The terrorist attack on our embassy in Kabul on October 8 is yet another grim reminder of the forces we are pitted against, the Prime Minister said.        
	Singh said the security situation in Indias neighbourhood had worsened in the past year. He said the armed forces should be trained to fight anywhere, anytime and under any conditions. Their ability to deal with non-traditional threats must receive greater attention.        
	He urged the defence establishment to draw up modernisation plans that involved the army, the navy and the air force.

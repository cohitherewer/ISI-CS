  - Cops name 3 molesters        SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                          Two of the accused being taken to a Mumbai court on Thursday. (PTI)                                        
	Mumbai, April 16: At least three of the men who allegedly gangraped an American student in Mumbai on Sunday are students of Indias premier academic institutions.        
	One of the accused is a student of SP Jain Institute of Management and Research of Mumbai. Two are from the Tata Institute of Social Sciences. But the institutes are not being very co-operative, said deputy commissioner of police Dilip Sawant.        
	Both the institutes officially refused to confirm or deny if the accused were their students.        
	It is not right to say that we are being unco-operative. The police have merely told us that one of the accused is a student of our institute. But they have not given us any names yet. We are doing our own investigations to find out more, said a top source at the Jain institute.        
	A faculty source at TISS said: Vacations are on and many students have left the campus as some of the courses have ended. Some students are hanging around on the campus though they have technically passed out days ago. There are so many departments here. We are not sure whether the students in question are current students or ex-students. All faculty members and students staying on the campus have been banned from speaking to the media.        
	The victim hails from Idaho in the US and is a student of the Gender Studies Department at TISS, the police said. She came to India in October 2008.        
	Three of the alleged rapists arrested are Anish Barkataki, Kundan Burgohain and Dev Singh. A lower court today sent them to police custody until April 28.        
	The remaining three  Vinamra Soni, Karan Singh and Harsh  are absconding. All are between 20 and 22 years.        
	Anish and Kundan hail from Assam. The flat where the alleged rape took place belongs to Kundan, the police said. Anish has told us he is a student of the SP Jain Management Institute. We are verifying his claim, said Sawant.        
	The victim had gone out for dinner to a restaurant with two of the men, whom she knew, and she has said in her complaint that they spiked her drink on the way to the flat where the other four were waiting.        
	The 23-year-old, in her FIR, has also alleged that policemen at a government hospital where she first went for a medical examination refused to help her when she tried to lodge a complaint.        
	The doctor at Rajwadi Government Hospital in suburban Ghatkopar had referred her to policemen at the hospital. She said she waited at the hospital for a long time but no police officer was ready to guide her, so she left the place. Later, after speaking to her family in the US and friends here, she came and filed the case at Trombay police station on Monday, Sawant said.        
	An NGO is counselling her. She is also in touch with the US consulate, he said.        
	The victim got in touch with the American citizens cell at the consulate and they guided her to the police, a source at the American Center said.        
	Center director Elizabeth Kauffman refused to comment on the alleged police apathy. We do not comment on any countrys police system or any administrative set-up, she said.

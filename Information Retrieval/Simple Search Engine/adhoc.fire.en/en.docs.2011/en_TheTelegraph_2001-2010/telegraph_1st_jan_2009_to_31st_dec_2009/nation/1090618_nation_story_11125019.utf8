The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitish admits candidate selection error
                                                                                                               Nitish admits candidate selection error
          NALIN VERMA                          The chief minister on his dhanyabad yatra that began from Patna on Wednesday. On the first day, Nitish Kumar travelled to Darbhanga, Madhubani and Ghangarpur. (Deepak Kumar)                                  
	Patna, June 17: It was an error of judgement in selecting candidates for the Lok Sabha seats that disallowed JD(U)-led NDA from making a clean sweep in Bihar in the general elections, admitted chief minister Nitish Kumar yesterday while talking to The Telegraph.         
	The JD(U)-BJP combination won 32 seats against eight pocketed by rivals.        
	Talking on the sidelines of yesterdays grand feast that he threw for party workers at his 1 Anne Marg residence, Nitish Kumar pointed out that his party would have won a couple of more seats had its leadership made the right choice of candidates for Siwan and Kishenganj.        
	The JD(U) had denied ticket to former leader Omprakash Yadav who contested the poll as rebel and won, defeating official party nominee Brishen Patel in Siwan. However, the rebel candidate did tell all who would hear that he was the actual JD(U) candidate and did represent Nitish Kumar and JD(U)s philosophy during his poll campaign.         
	The chief minister, however, seemed more than satisfied with the poll results. Maine to janata se apne kaam ka majduri manga thaa. Logon ne mujhe ummeed se jyade diya (I had asked voters to pay me my due wage in lieu of the work that I had done. What they gave me exceeded all expectations.)        
	In a oblique reference to former friend and now rival Lalu Prasad, Nitish Kumar admitted that victory was a humbling experience. I have never stated that I have battered my rivals. I respect the Opposition for it is a part of the democratic system. I do not want the opposition to disappear, he said.         
	In a more direct statement he said: Lalu Prasad is not ready to accept his defeat at the hands of the people. He must admit that he stands defeated and honour the peoples verdict. We have been in the Opposition in Bihar for nearly 13 years. We served the people in the position they had left us to serve them. He must do the same         
	Asserting himself as a hard core socialist, Nitish Kumar however made it amply clear that that he harboured no plans to sever ties with the BJP.         
	We have our own Brand Modi (read: his deputy Sushil Kumar Modi) in the Bihar BJP that we chose to do business with. We do not have anything to do with the other Modi (Narendra Modi, the chief minister of Gujarat).         
	Through other statements the chief minister drove home the point that Bihar BJP, led by Sushil Kumar Modi, was more suited to Nitish Kumars socialism and agenda of inclusive growth.         
	Incidentally, when this correspondent met the chief minister post a simple meal, he was studying a letter sent by a Maharashtra socialist leader who had suggested that the Bihar chief minister revive the Congress Socialist Party founded by Jai Prakash Narayan, Ram Monohar Lohia and others in 1935.         
	It was from this party that Nitish and others of his ilk derived their brand of political philosophy.

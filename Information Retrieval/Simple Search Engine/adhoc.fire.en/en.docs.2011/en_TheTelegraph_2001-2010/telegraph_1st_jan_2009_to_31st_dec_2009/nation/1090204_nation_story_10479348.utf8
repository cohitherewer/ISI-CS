  - Kanija lake in focus for zoo          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Kanija lake                                        
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 3: Nandan Kanan zoo celebrated World Wetlands Day with much fanfare today, as the Kanjia lake was designated as a wetland of national importance last year.        
	The lake has been meeting the fresh water needs of the Nandan Kanan zoo as well as the botanical garden.         
	With its rich biodiversity and strategic location, Kanjia can serve as an excellent site for wetland education. Besides its rich shoreline flora and fauna, it can serve as an open laboratory for schoolchildren. Three species of wild rice and more than 40 species of riverine fishes are found in this wetland, said Nandan Kanan zoo director Ajit Pattnaik. More than 1.7 million people visit Nandan Kanan every year.        
	The wetland, lying south of the Mahanadi delta head, is spread over 105 hectares, which includes a main lake area of 75 hectares and other small satellite wetlands measuring 30 hectares.        
	To mark the World Wetlands Day, a workshop on wetland education was organised for students in collaboration with the Union ministry of environment and forest. About 100 schoolchildren from different wetland areas of the state participated in the event attended by international experts, including Prof Tsuji, the president of Wetlands International, Japan, Prof Natori of UN University, Tokyo, and seven other foreign delegates from Ramsar Centre, Japan.        
	Sit-and-draw and debate competitions were also held for the schoolchildren. A brochure on Kanjia lake and a the Ramsar poster reproduced in Oriya were released.         
	Message on wetland values and functions in form of appropriate signage has been installed at strategic locations. A learning trail in the form of a promenade has been developed along the shoreline of the lake with appropriate signage depicting the conservation need of a wetland. A special wetland education kit has been developed for student visitors, said Patnaik.

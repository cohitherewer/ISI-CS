                                                                                                               Love lost, Fiza pops pills 
          GAJINDER SINGH                              
	Chandigarh, Jan. 29: The former Haryana deputy chief ministers second wife today allegedly attempted suicide, a day after claiming her in-laws had kidnapped her husband.        
	Fiza, 37, allegedly popped dozens of sleeping pills and was rushed to hospital in a critical condition by her uncle Satpal. He suggested, however, the overdose may not have been intentional.        
	She hadnt slept all night after Mohans disappearance yesterday. This morning, she asked for a sleeping tablet. Its possible she had an overdose, Satpal said.         
	Chander Mohan, former chief minister Bhajan Lals son who converted to Islam and changed his name to Chand Mohammad two months ago to marry Fiza, hadnt arrived to see his wife at the hospital till this evening. Fiza was known as Anuradha Bali before she too converted.         
	The police plan to file an FIR for attempted suicide against Fiza. She is unfit to record any statement today. We will try to record her statement tomorrow, an officer said.        
	Chand wasnt available for comment today but had yesterday denied Fizas claim that he was kidnapped at the behest of his brother Kuldeep Bishnoi. I have left home on my own and will be back when the people (Fiza and her family) want me to, he said.        
	Satpal, however, said: He (Mohan) was asked to come out by two known persons who said they wanted to give him some money. When he got into their vehicle, they drove away with him.         
	Chand, who already had a wife and two children when he married Fiza, was sacked as deputy chief minister after the marriage. Fiza lost her job as assistant advocate-general.         
	The script appears to have gone awry for the couple, who had recently spoken of producing a film based on their love story.

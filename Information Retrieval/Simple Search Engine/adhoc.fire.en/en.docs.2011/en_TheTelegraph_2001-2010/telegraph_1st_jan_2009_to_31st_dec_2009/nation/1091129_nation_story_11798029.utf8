  - Jagannath properties order        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Cuttack, Nov. 28: The fight for possession over more than 50,000 acres of Amrutamonohi land of Lord Jagannath has taken a new turn after 16 months with the Supreme Court issuing a stay order on Orissa High Courts verdict against its re-settlement in favour of the state government.        
	Amrutamonohi lands are extensive properties endowed to Lord Jagannath and in possession of maths and other religious institutions connected with the Puri temple as trustees.        
	The lands were endowed in the nature of Amrutamonohi with the avowed purpose that the usufructs from the property should be used as a food offering (bhog) to Lord Jagannath in Puri.        
	Puri Jagannath Temple Administration had filed applications for resettlement of Amrutamonohi lands of Lord Jagannath with the state government as they had been vested with the government in 1974.        
	Mahanta Satyanarayan Ramanuj Das and two others representing Sri Sidha Matha challenged the applications filed by the temple administration.        
	Acting on the petitions, the high court had ruled that Amrutamonohi lands of Lord Jagannath cannot be re-settled in favour of the temple administration, but can be only put up for sale with the temple administration as one of the executants of the sale deed.        
	The temple administration had subsequently challenged the verdict of the high court in the Supreme Court.        
	Temple administration sources today said the Supreme Court issued an interim stay order on the high court verdict earlier this week.        
	The high court ruling had in July last year specified: In case any alienation of Amrutamonohi land is made 75 per cent of the consideration money as per the market value obtained on account of such alienation shall be deposited with the temple administration for being used as food offering to Lord Jagannath. The balance 25 per cent will be taken by the marfatdar/mahanta of the math or religious institution as one time measure so that the purchaser will not have to render the service attached to the property any further.         
	The court also clarified that the observations and directions would be operative prospectively.        
	The dispute assumes significance as nearly 44,535 acres of land in Puri were recorded as Amrutamonohi land. In Cuttack, nearly 4,577 acres and another 3,544 acres in Balasore were recorded as Amrutamonohi land.

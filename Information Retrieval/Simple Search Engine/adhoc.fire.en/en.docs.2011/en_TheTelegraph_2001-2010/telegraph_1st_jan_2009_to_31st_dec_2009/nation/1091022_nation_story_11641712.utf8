The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Korean Prez visit meets Posco hurdle
                                                                                                               Korean Prez visit meets Posco hurdle
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 21: The jinxed Posco plant proposal will hit another roadblock with anti-plant protesters announcing that they would oppose South Korean President Lee-Myung Baks possible visit to the project site near Paradip port.        
	We will oppose the visit, confirmed Posco Pratirodh Sangram Samiti president Abhaya Sahoo talking to reporters here today.        
	Lee is scheduled to visit India as a guest for the Republic Day celebrations in January and is likely to attend a foundation laying ceremony at the proposed site.        
	Recently, the Centre had asked the government if it would be possible to organise a safe visit for Lee to the Posco site. The Centre had also suggested a meeting between the government, Posco and ArcelorMittal this week to clear all hurdles.        
	A few months ago, Posco had hinted that it would alter the Orissa project site, albeit slightly.        
	Posco had signed an MoU with the government on June 22, 2005, to set up a 12MTPA mega-steel plant with an investment of Rs 51,000 crore near Paradip. However, the project, billed as the biggest foreign direct investment project, has virtually remained a non-starter with the administration failing to acquire land for the plant due to persistent agitation by Posco Pratirodh Sangram Samiti for the past four years.        
	We will stage a demonstration peacefully and democratically so that the President will be forced to go back, said PPSS chief reiterating that the project-affected people would not spare an inch of land for the plant.        
	We will continue our fight till the last drop of our blood has been shed, said Sahoo, who was released from jail a couple of months ago.        
	The samiti representing displaced families of three gram panchayats has been opposing the project arguing that it would destroy local economy based on paddy, prawn and betel-leaf cultivation. Posco, on the other hand, has announced a compensation and rehabilitation package for the project-affected people.         
	Last month, Posco chief executive officer Joon Yang Chung had announced his companys plan to set up a foundation to take up health, education and vocational training projects in the area.

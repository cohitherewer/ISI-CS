The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Time will judge N-pact: PM
                                                                                                               Time will judge N-pact: PM
          JOHN MARY                              
	Thiruvananthapuram, April 11: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said time would judge the wisdom of his decision to sign the Indo-US nuclear deal.        
	Kicking off electioneering in the south from Kerala, Singh was possibly responding to criticism that even the Congress had not lauded in its campaigns the deal on which he had staked the future of his government.        
	Ignoring the BJP, a marginal player in Kerala, Singh took on the Left, saying it had been found on the wrong side of history many times in the past.         
	When our government signed the nuclear deal to end Indias nuclear isolation and provide the much-needed energy critical for development, the Left walked out of our government. Time will alone judge the wisdom of our decision, he said in his soft but assertive tone.        
	When Mahatma Gandhi launched the Quit India movement in 1942, the Left had opposed it. When India won Independence, the Left had campaigned that this freedom is not for real. When Indira Gandhi launched the Green Revolution in the sixties, the Left had said it was to help foreign seed companies.        
	When Rajiv Gandhi introduced computers in the eighties, the Left had opposed it, saying it would take away jobs. It was ironic that IT today was one of the biggest job providers.        
	Reading from a written speech, Singh was harsh on the Left and the BJP, though he did not mention the latter by name.         
	Choose carefully. The party you vote should have the leadership and the experience to tackle serious economic crises. Though not untouched by the economic downturn, we are better placed to face this than most other countries, he said.        
	The people should decide whether to support the steady hand of the Congress or that of others who play with emotions for narrow political gains or were glued together for the sake of power.        
	The country was on the cusp of new opportunities and had the resources to develop and distribute that development to all sections. The country needed a government that understood the pulse of the people.         
	The Left Front had the knack of using ideology to cover up political opportunism. But the people of Kerala would see through their hypocrisy, he said.        
	Both at Palluruthy, near Kochi, and the northern Kozhikode, Singh said the Left government was unfriendly to the Centre, to the people and investors.        
	The Lefts restrictive policies warded off investors, who went and set up industries in neighbouring Kanyakumari, Mangalore and Coimbatore, converting them into boom towns.        
	If only the Left created the right investment climate, every district in the state could have developed enormously.        
	Singh claimed that in spite of his best efforts to help Kerala, the Left Front had obstructed development. Kerala was the only state that had raised objections to national highway projects.         
	The LDF government had not given the youth their due, he said, blaming it for not making efforts to tap the huge funds from non-resident Keralites.

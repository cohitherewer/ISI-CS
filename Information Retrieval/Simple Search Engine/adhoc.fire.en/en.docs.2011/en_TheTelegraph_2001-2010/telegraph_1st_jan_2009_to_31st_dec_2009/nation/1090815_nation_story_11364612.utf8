The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Twittering with Rahul? Its a fake 
                                                                                                               Twittering with Rahul? Its a fake 
  - Tharoor kills net buzz                              Rahul Gandhi                                  
	A group of Rahul Gandhi admirers who thought they were Twittering with him suddenly find their wings clipped.        
	It has now emerged that the Amethi MPs account on popular social networking site Twitter was fake.        
	The word has come from one of the best-known Twitter users in India, junior external affairs minister Shashi Tharoor. Rahul Gandhi confirmed to me today that his alleged Twitter account was a fake. It wasnt him, not even an aide, he said in his post on the site.        
	The revelation came as a big disappointment to the admirers, around 400 of them, who had been thinking all along that it was either Rahuls own account or was being run by some of his aides. The group includes doctors, artists, techies and even journalists.        
	But Tharoor had an advice for those dismayed. Look for verified accts (accounts)!. That shouldnt have been difficult for the 400 users: Not a single tweet has been posted by Rahul. Tweets are text-based posts of up to 140 characters displayed on the authors profile page and delivered to members, known as followers.        
	In sharp contrast, the site showed Tharoor had some 888 tweets and 21,975 followers as of today.         
	One message from a Bareilly follower, clearly in awe of Rahul, read: M (I am) ur (your) biggest fan. I just want to tackle situations and problems like u (you) do.        
	Another follower, a woman, wrote to Rahul venting her anger at parliamentarians playing truant. Her reference was to MPs, not just from Rahuls Congress, who didnt turn up in Parliament regularly.        
	Tharoor has helped some young MPs start Twittering. The most recent to join the site is K. Sudhakaran, the Congress MP from Keralas Kannur. Tharoor is the party MP from state capital Thiruvanathapuram.

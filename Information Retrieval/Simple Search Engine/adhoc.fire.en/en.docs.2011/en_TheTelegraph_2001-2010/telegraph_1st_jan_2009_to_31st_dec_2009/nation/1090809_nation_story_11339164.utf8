          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          MV Musen, the detained North Korean ship, anchored near Port Blair on Friday. (Reuters)                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 8: A North Korean ship detained by the Coast Guard in the Andamans since Thursday on suspicion that it was carrying nuclear or missile weapon components was carrying legitimate cargo.        
	As per the reports available, the ship was carrying cargo containing genuine merchandise, the chief of naval staff, Admiral Sureesh Mehta, said here today.        
	The MV Musen had left Thailand on July 27. It had no business being in Indian waters, Coast Guard officials said. Moreover, the ship did not respond to signals from the Coast Guard to stop.        
	The fact is that the ship had no business to be there, Admiral Mehta said. Asked if the Indian authorities suspected that it was carrying contraband nuclear or weapons equipment, Mehta said: That was our apprehension also. At the moment, it is carrying genuine merchandise.        
	In 2006, the Indian Coast Guard had detained a North Korean vessel that was said to be carrying illegal cargo.        
	The MV Musen was not sailing and had dropped anchor off Hut Bay island in the Andamans archipelago.        
	We had to use some force, the navy chief confirmed. A Coast Guard Dornier aircraft took off at first and conveyed the location of the vessel. When the ship did not respond to signals, a warning shot was fired. The ship was forced to go to Port Blair.        
	One Coast Guard official said the ship was carrying about 16,500 tonnes of sugar. The crew of about 40 is in the custody of Indian authorities.        
	The ships captain has apparently told his interrogators that the MV Musen had entered Indian waters because of mechanical problems, reports PTI from Port Blair.        
	The ship was said to have gone to Singapore from Thailand. It docked in Singapore on July 30. It was said to be headed for Umm Qasr, Iraq.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 8: Shibu Sorens defeat in the Tamar by-election is egg on the face for the UPA coalition in Jharkhand, but it has neither come as a shock to the Congress high command, nor are too many tears being shed for him. As one Congress leader said, Guruji has suffered the consequences of his own sins, he extended the corruption raj of Madhu Koda (his predecessor) and he is paying for it.         
	There have been suggestions in political circles that sections of the Congress conspired to have Soren defeated, but observers say Soren may not have required the benefit of a conspiracy to lose to Raja Peter of the Jharkhand Party, which is part of the ruling coalition but rose in revolt.        
	Soren has done nothing to help his image as a leader presiding over the systematic plundering of Jharkhands resources, said the Congress leader. He was unpopular, and when people got the chance, they proved it to him.         
	The Congress has reasons to be secretly pleased at Sorens humiliation  thrown out of the Manmohan Singh government on a murder taint, he openly harangued the Congress into installing him as Jharkhand chief minister as prize for his support to the UPA in the July trust vote  but that brings no relief to the new dilemma the party faces: should it become part of the jockeying to find a replacement for Soren, or should it pitch for Presidents rule?         
	Congress spokesperson Veerappa Moily sounded firm this evening that the UPA government in Jharkhand would continue. One bypoll cannot be treated as a referendum on the government, the coalition will last its term successfully, he said, without offering any hint about who could succeed Soren.         
	The man most keen is Madhu Koda himself; he is in the capital and believed to be lobbying hard to stage a comeback. Soren himself is arriving tonight. Both Koda and Soren are believed to have sought meetings with Congress president Sonia Gandhi.         
	But signals emerging from the Congress suggest that the party is leaning to the course now being demanded by the BJP: impose Presidents rule and hold fresh elections along with the Lok Sabha polls due in April.         
	A senior Congress leader said, The real issue is that both the Koda and Soren governments have been extremely unpopular on account of rampant corruption. The party will have to think hard whether it wants to participate in another messy experiment when general elections are so close.         
	Only last week, Soren had to sack two ministers  Enos Ekka and Hari Narain Rai after allegations of disproportionate amassing of assets emerged against them.

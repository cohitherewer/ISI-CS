	Rae Bareli, April 6: From Sushma Swaraj to Vinay Katiyar to Rakesh Bahadur Singh.        
	Rakesh who?        
	Rakesh the contractor-cum-auto parts dealer, thats who. The man the BJP has nominated as cannon fodder against Sonia Gandhi  who filed her nomination from Rae Bareli today  having decided it is pointless to sacrifice big names in a lost cause.        
	The BJP had sent Sushma to Bellary in Karnataka to take on the Congress president way back in 1999. Those were different days and Sonia, too, was unsure of herself  she was using Bellary as a backup in case her campaign at Amethi, against the BJPs Sanjay Singh, turned rocky.                        Sushma, Katiyar: Big-ticket bunnies      
	The bindi-sporting, Swadeshi-spouting Sushma projected herself as the Bharatiya Beti against the Videshi Bahu but lost.        
	In 2004, the little-known Girish Narayan Pandey polled just 31,000 votes against the Congress chief but during the 2006 by-election  prompted by Sonias resignation over the office-of-profit controversy  the BJP was back attempting a coup with a big-ticket candidate.        
	It chose a reluctant Katiyar, a Sangh parivar hard-liner who had held the Faizabad seat from 1999 to 2004.        
	Sonia won by over 4.17 lakh votes and Katiyar lost his deposit, winning less than 20,000 votes. He came a distant third behind the Samajwadi Party candidate, who too lost his deposit, polling 57,000 votes.        
	So Rakesh it will be this time. The Allahabadi in his 50s was a Vishwa Hindu Parishad member who joined the BJP in 2000, and was recently made the partys Rae Bareli district president.        
	Not everyone in the BJP is happy, though  especially those still fancying a tilt at Sonia themselves.         
	The BJP, which launched a campaign against the UPA across the country, has failed to find a suitable candidate to corner Sonia Gandhi. This is a shame. It is now a cakewalk for her, said a dissident BJP leader in Rae Bareli who wanted to contest the election.        
	The Bahujan Samaj Party, too, has chosen to play it safe, fielding a local leader instead of a party bigwig. R.K. Kushwaha, a former MLA from Lakhimpur Kheri, is the BSPs district president in Rae Bareli and has headed frontal party organisations such as the Uttar Pradesh Nagarik Parishad.        
	The Samajwadi Party has not put up a candidate in Rae Bareli.        
	Sonia, accompanied by son Rahul, arrived at the district collectorate in a motorcade around 12.25pm. All along the way she was showered with rose petals.                    
	She followed family tradition by attending a yagna at the Congress office in Rae Bareli. On her way back to the airport, she visited the tomb of Islamic scholar and cleric Maulana Ali Meeyan in Takia village.        
	Daughter Priyanka Vadra, who is in charge of Sonias campaign, could not make it to the constituency because of her father-in-laws death. A recorded message from her, however, played on many voters mobile phones as a sound clip.        
	Rae Bareli was the constituency of Indira Gandhi and her workplace, it is a holy place for all of us. I appeal to you to continue to shower us with your love, Priyankas message said.        
	The clip will be played till April 12, after which Priyanka is expected to be able to travel to Rae Bareli to campaign for the April 30 vote.

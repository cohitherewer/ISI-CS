  SANJAY K. JHA    
	New Delhi, Jan. 27: The Mangalore incident in which young girls at a pub were beaten up by the Ram Senas culture cops has dented L.K. Advanis carefully crafted project to woo first-time voters.        
	The BJP and the RSS have condemned the incident and stressed that the Karnataka government was taking action, but senior leaders are worried television pictures of the goons manhandling the girls could have an adverse impact.        
	Some fear the images could re-ignite the debate on individual freedom that saffron outfits have often stoked in the name of protecting Indias culture.        
	Although the Ram Sena is not a part of the Sangh parivar, its president Pramod Mutalik was once a swayamsewak and headed the Bajrang Dal in Karnataka. So, he is seen as a product of BJP politics.        
	For BJPs Prime Minister candidate Advani, the incident could not have come at a worse time. It has derailed the BJPs project of showcasing him as a progressive man on his website and holding first-time voter conferences  basically a Chak de song and snacks show  to win the youth vote.        
	India today is a young country. We have the youngest population in the world today. Our children and our young men and women are our richest resource. They are also the brightest sources of hope for Indias future, Advanis action plan for the youth says.        
	But the pub thrashing and similar incidents  couples being beaten up on Valentines Day  in Maharashtra and Karnataka over the past five-six years are bound to cast a shadow.        
	The BJPs rejection of the acts  hooliganism, according to party president Rajnath Singh  may not cut much ice with the youth because the Sangh parivar has often backed such cultural policing in the past.        
	There have been several incidents of Bajrang Dal activists harassing and thrashing couples on Valentines Day. The Shiv Sena, whom the BJP flaunts as its most trusted ally, has built its political profile through such campaigns.        
	Despite the Ram Sena chiefs earlier connections, the BJP can safely wash its hands of him because there are no electoral compulsions involved. But it cannot afford the political luxury of slamming the Shiv Senas actions, many of which are similar.        
	The BJPs attitude to the Shiv Sena exposes the irony of opportunistic politics. It condemned Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray for his campaign against north Indian migrants, but was guarded when he did similar things while in the Shiv Sena.        
	Asked why the BJP was so critical of the Ram Sena and not so much of the Shiv Sena, BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad ducked a direct reply. We have strongly condemned what Raj Thackeray did.

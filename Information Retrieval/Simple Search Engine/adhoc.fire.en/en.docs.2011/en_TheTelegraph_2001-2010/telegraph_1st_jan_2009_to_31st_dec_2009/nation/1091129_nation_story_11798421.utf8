The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Aussie teens more   violent
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Aussie teens more   violent
                                  
	Melbourne, Nov. 28 (PTI): Australian boys have become more violent than American teenagers in the past one year, a study has suggested.        
	Over 4,000 students, aged between 12 and 16, in Australia and the US were interviewed by researchers from Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, Victoria, and the University of Washington.         
	They found more Australian teenagers engaged in violence compared with American boys.        
	There have been a series of attacks on Indians in Australia this year.        
	During the first interview, 12.6 per cent of Australian boys admitted to violent behaviour, compared with 10 per cent Americans. In a follow-up a year later, the numbers were higher  17.5 per cent in Australia and 12.6 per cent in the US.        
	The higher rate of violence among Australian schoolboys was unexpected and required further investigation, lead researcher Sheryl Hemphill said.        
	The study found that students who were suspended from school or arrested were 1.5 times more likely to engage in violence within a year.

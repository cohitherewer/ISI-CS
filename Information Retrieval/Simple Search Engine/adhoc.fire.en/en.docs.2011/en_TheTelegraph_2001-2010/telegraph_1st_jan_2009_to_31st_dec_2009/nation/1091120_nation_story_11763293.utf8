          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 19: The University Grants Commission (UGC) is violating its own regulations to exempt handpicked institutions from following tough new qualifications required to teach at universities, the human resource development ministry has alleged.        
	The ministry has written to the UGC asking it to stop violating recently strengthened qualifications for teaching to exempt select universities and colleges, top commission sources have said.         
	The ministrys concerns were discussed today at a UGC meeting where it accepted that it had exempted some institutions from the qualification norms but argued that it was justified, the sources said.        
	The commission did not take a formal decision at the meeting because of the absence of chairperson Sukhdeo Thorat.        
	But the sources admitted that the ministrys opposition had rendered it next to impossible for the UGC to justify any future exemptions.        
	The exemptions under the scanner were always granted for specific courses and only to assist the college or university in tackling faculty shortage, the sources said.        
	But the allegations and the UGCs admission suggest that the countrys apex higher education regulator is ignoring norms to assist some institutions hire sub-standard teachers  according to its whims.        
	Confirming the letter had been sent to the UGC, ministry officials said they were concerned that the exemptions could effectively dilute the new regulations aimed at ensuring quality teachers.         
	Under minimum teaching qualifications required at Indian universities and colleges, aspirants must hold PhDs or must have cleared the National Eligibility Test or equivalent exams at the state level.        
	Only candidates in subjects not examined under the NET are exempt from this rule  notified as part of the revised pay for teachers under the Sixth Pay Commission.         
	The UGC has been extending the exemption to select candidates in subjects tested under the NET, a violation of its own regulations. The UGC sources argued that the exemptions were granted only in special cases.         
	There are special circumstances in which an institution may be struggling with faculty shortage in a subject where few candidates are coming forward with adequate qualifications. Our exemptions were only aimed at helping such institutions, a commission member said.        
	The sources could not explain why they chose to violate their own regulations instead of seeking to amend them if the exemptions were granted only in legitimate cases.         
	The ministrys criticism comes as the latest embarrassment for the UGC, which is already battling allegations that it assisted in the mushrooming of dubious deemed universities.

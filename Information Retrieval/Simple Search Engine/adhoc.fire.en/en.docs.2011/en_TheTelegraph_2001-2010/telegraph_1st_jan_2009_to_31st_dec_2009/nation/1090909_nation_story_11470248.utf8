The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | IIT faculty unhappy with Sibal 
                                                                                                               IIT faculty unhappy with Sibal 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 8: Kapil Sibal today met representatives of IIT faculty protesting a controversial new pay regime but failed to assure them that their concerns would be addressed.         
	The HRD minister, however, may have successfully delayed any public protests by asking the faculty to wait for government corrections in the pay regime, aimed at meeting a key demand of the teachers.         
	IIT faculty representatives suggested they could wait till the HRD ministry issued a new notification on the pay scales, before deciding whether to continue with their protest.         
	But the representatives who met Sibal today indicated they were unhappy and that the unprecedented tussle over pay at the IITs could continue.         
	The controversy revolves around a new pay regime that snips salaries proposed by a central panel and ignores suggested additional incentives for faculty at the IITs and IIMs.        
	PM showers praise        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh showered rare praise on his HRD ministry colleagues today, rating Sibal and his deputy D. Purandeswari among the finest minds in the government.

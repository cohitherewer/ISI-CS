                                                                                                               Army faces picnic charge
                            
	Srinagar, Oct. 25 (PTI): the Jammu and Kashmir government has alleged that the army is using land in the Ladakh division for entertaining the families of their officials in the name of defence of the nation.        
	In an affidavit submitted to Jammu and Kashmir High Court, state advocate general M.I. Qadiri said this while responding to the armys claim for a piece of land near the picturesque Pangong lake.        
	The affidavit was filed in response to the armys claim that police have no right to proceed against officers who had allegedly manhandled civil and police officials while they were returning after demolishing an unauthorised structure of the army at the lake in the Ladakh region.        
	In fact, the boat is being used by the army on the pretext of patrolling for the entertainment of their families and not for any defence purpose So far no one has witnessed that the boat has been used either for surveillance or any other defence purpose, the affidavit said while referring to the deployment of the boat patrol base.        
	The dispute was sparked as the police secured a non-bailable warrant against three army officers  Major General Manvendra Singh (the then brigadier), Colonel M.P. Erray and Major S. Dabbas  from the chief judicial magistrate in Leh for allegedly manhandling civilian officials. The officials were returning from Pangong lake after demolishing the alleged illegal structure erected by the army in 2005.        
	The officers had allegedly manhandled the then sub-divisional magistrate of Nyoma, Ali Raza, and two other officials. The state also strongly objected to the armys claim that government officials were hampering the work of the soldiers while they were performing national duty.        
	The army, in its affidavit, claimed that the state government officials had damaged various sensitive equipment, including night vision devices worth Rs 1.2 crore. In the same plea, it had, however, said the equipment had been taken back.        
	The lake, situated at 13,900 feet and 168km from Leh, is frequented by hundreds of foreign tourists. An inner line permit is required to visit the lake as it lies on the Sino-India Line of Actual Control with two-thirds of it lying in China.        
	It became the centre of a legal battle between the state administration and the army over its ownership after the government planned to encourage tourism near the lake.

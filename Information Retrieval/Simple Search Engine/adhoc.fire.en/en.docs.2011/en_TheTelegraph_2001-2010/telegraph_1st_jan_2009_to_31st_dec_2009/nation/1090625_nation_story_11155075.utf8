	Hyderabad, June 24: A 29-year-old software engineer who was laid off four months back hanged himself last night, apparently fed up with his joblessness.        
	Police said Sachin B. Khandewar, who hailed from Sholapur in Maharashtra and had been working in a city firm, hanged himself from the ceiling fan at his aunts house in the Kacheguda area.        
	He left behind a suicide note addressed to the police saying his unsuccessful career had forced him to take the dire step, the police said.         
	I am bored of this meaningless and useless life. My unsuccessful career is the cause of my death. Nobody is responsible for it, the note said.        
	He had written another note, addressed to his parents and aunt, explaining the reasons for ending his life and apologising to them.        
	According to Kacheguda station house officer P. Sai Reddy, Sachin could have killed himself around midnight.        
	Aunt Sindhu Chandergi, 65, with whom Sachin had been staying for the past four years, had gone to her native place in Sholapur. She returned this morning, found Sachin hanging in his room, and informed the police.         
	Sindhu told the police Sachin had been looking for a job since he was retrenched but could not get one.        
	Last Thursday, laid-off software engineer Pradeep Kumar had committed suicide in a hotel near Kacheguda railway station hours after arriving from Bangalore, where he used to work.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 19: The defence ministry today got the vice chief of air staff, Air Marshal P.K. Barbora, to issue a clarification saying his comments on not inducting women as fighter pilots reflected his personal views and not the governments.        
	I would like to clarify that my remarks concerning off-springs and imposing some conditions were my own personal opinion and not that of the Indian Air Force or the ministry of defence, Barbora said in a statement this evening.        
	Briefing the media on Tuesday on President Pratibha Patils planned sortie in a Sukhoi fighter jet, he had said that in future, if women were to be inducted into flying, they could be asked not to get pregnant before a certain age.        
	The Chiefs of Staff Committee (comprising the chiefs of army, the navy and the air force) has taken a decision to not permit women in combat. But these days missiles are fired from 50 or even 100km away. So we are examining if women can be involved in a way that will increase our combat potential maybe with certain preconditions. A preliminary medical study is on, Barbora had said.        
	He went on to say that the government spent about Rs 11.66 crore to train a fighter pilot and if a woman was in the family way or was going to have an offspring, it would restrain the air force from utilising that training optimally.        
	Feminist organisations took umbrage at the observations, which they said were disparaging towards women.        
	Today, Barbora spoke of a careful approach. Induction of women into actual combat is a tri-services issue and demands a careful orchestrated approach starting with grant of permanent commission to women, he said in his statement.         
	A step-by-step approach would be the preferred option in respect of employability of women in the defence forces. In not a distant future, we hope to see women pilots flying fighters in some form of combat roles, he added.        
	The Air Marshal claimed he issued the statement today because his earlier comments had been misinterpreted.         
	If I had hurt any groups sentiments, I would like to state that it was not with any malicious intentions of hurting anyones feelings or casting any aspersions on their ability, Barbora added.

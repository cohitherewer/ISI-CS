The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Airport quiz no big deal, says Salman
                                                                                                               Airport quiz no big deal, says Salman
  - Rest of Bollywood outraged         PRATIM D. GUPTA AND AGENCIES                                            
	Calcutta, Aug. 16: The man who is forever finding himself on the wrong side of the law has come up with perhaps the most law-abiding line amid the celebrity hysteria surrounding Shah Rukh Khans ordeal at a US airport.        
	Blame it on his animosity for SRK or just his frankness, Salman Khans not a big deal comment is easily the sanest reaction around.        
	It is not such a big deal; when we go there we too have to go through the security check. There have been no attacks there since 9/11 because of their stringent security measures. I think it (the security check) is a good thing, Salman said yesterday, within hours of Shah Rukh being detained at Newark Airport and questioned for over two hours.        
	Compare this with Union minister Ambika Sonis tit-for-tat solution  I am of the opinion that the way we are frisked, we should also do the same to them (the Americans)  and Salmans stand doesnt necessarily come out as the lopsided one.  
	The film industry, especially the SRK camp, was quick to dub Salmans reaction as his latest attempt to go after Shah Rukh, a regular occurrence ever since the two Khans fought at Katrina Kaifs birthday party about a year ago.        
	SRKs filmmaker friend Karan Johar, whose My Name is Khan starring Shah Rukh deals with racial discrimination in America, admitted to being shocked and upset.        
	Om Shanti Om director Farah Khan called it lack of knowledge about the worlds biggest star while Juhi Chawla termed it as absurd as Brad Pitt coming to India, being strip-searched, investigated and interrogated.        
	But this is how its been for a long time. Even Amitabh Bachchan was questioned at a New York airport many years ago. When he said he was an actor, he was asked if his churidar-kurta was the costume for a shoot.        
	More recently, Oscar-winner Resul Pookutty was detained at Los Angeles airport while visiting the US for the Academy Awards night. I was told I was a random pick. They took me to a room and started questioning me, the sound designer told The Telegraph. They initially wouldnt believe I had been nominated for the Oscars but when they heard it was for Slumdog Millionaire, they got all excited and let me go.        
	Irrfan Khan, who has done The Namesake and A Mighty Heart  both Hollywood projects  has been detained twice. Once at New York and once at Los Angeles, he said. They dont care if you are an actor. They just look at your name and pick you for questioning.        
	Kabir Khan, who directed New York which is about terrorism and racial profiling in the US, said: Its fine to double check the identity of a person but when you take two hours to figure out that the person in front of you is Shah Rukh Khan, there is something seriously wrong in your system.        
	Actress Priyanka Chopra, a friend of SRKs, expressed on Twitter a widely held view: Its such behavior that fuels hatred racism. SRKs a world figure for Gods sake. GET REAL!!        
	Civil aviation minister Praful Patel said: We will take the issue with the United States government strongly. Such incidents we will not accept.        
	Not everyone appears upset. Meghnad Desai  an Indian-born economist, British MP and author of books on Indian cinema  joked the whole thing seemed a publicity stunt for My Name is Khan. The US government was an inadvertent accomplice to 20th Century Fox, which is investing millions in this movie, he said.         
	SRK said it wasnt the first time he had been questioned. They always do it and its odd travelling alone. I have always been worried about travelling to America. I dont look like a terrorist going to do anything to the country.        
	Most dont but they all have to go through this. King Khan or just another Khan.

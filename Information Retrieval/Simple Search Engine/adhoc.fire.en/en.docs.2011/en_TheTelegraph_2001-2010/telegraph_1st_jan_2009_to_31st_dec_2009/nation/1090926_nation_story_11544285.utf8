  - Between skyscrapers amp; US troops, it is difficult to ignore Indias presence at G20 summit        ASHOK V. DESAI                          Activists of Oxfam International, a group that fights poverty and injustice, stage a mock rugby match in Pittsburgh wearing masks, including those of Manmohan Singh and Barack Obama, on Thursday to draw attention to global poverty issues. (AP)                                        
	Pittsburgh, Sept. 25: It is difficult to ignore Indias weight here in Pittsburgh. Yesterday, the finance minister of a Latin American city was briefing his press; he occupied one table in the lobby of the hotel. Koreans were more conspicuous because they were more numerous; but one only saw them as ghosts in the corridors.        
	For the Indian media, the government had furnished a suite of rooms. Around me I count about a couple of dozens of computers with instant Internet connection, sofas inviting one to stretch out, and very adequate snacks. And since it is three in the morning and all the other journalists are fast asleep, this entire kingdom is mine.        
	Just outside the window is SS Gateway Clipper Fleet Classic, a pleasure boat which can take 100 people  unfortunately not for the exclusive use of the Indian media. It sits on the placid waters of River Mononghela, which a couple of hundred yards downstream meets the Allegheny. The two could not decide which was merging into which, so they together became the Ohio.        
	Their confluence makes a sharp angle, within which sits downtown Pittsburgh. It is unrecognisably different from the mighty city it was only thirty years ago, but the glory is not forgotten. Amongst the skyscrapers I gaze up to are the headquarters of US Steel, which once was a world industrial power; Alcoa, which counts even today amongst the worlds biggest aluminium producers; and Pittsburgh Plate Glass, whose glass windows I am looking through.        
	Up the Mononghela are mountains of iron ore which are no longer being stripped to feed Pittsburghs steel mills, which have been turned into warehouses and offices; but the coal mines continue to produce, and so do the sandpits which feed the glass factory.         
	The security is awesome. I count three bridges across the Mononghela. At this, western, end of them are overdressed American troops in grey camouflage, clustered around Hummers; their guns are at the ready. Thanks to the external affairs ministrys superb bandobast, I managed to get past them and drive across to downtown. To my great surprise, there were ordinary people all over, chatting, playing, walking. They could not miss the G20, but it did not disturb them. I just thought: if our security forces were guarding something on this scale, they would not allow common people within a mile.         
	The G20 is a strange animal. It is not a negotiating body like the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC). Nor is it entirely a talking shop like the UN itself. Its meeting today was obviously too short to arrive at any decision. The best word for it would be a pot-stirrer.         
	Global negotiations are carried out by the civil servants representing different countries in an array of negotiating bodies. But it is the civil servants religion to defend their national interest. They write up reams of jargon defining their national positions. Then they meet and defend the positions till the last man standing. So they can never reach agreement.         
	Leaders meet to shift those positions inch by inch and come to a consensus. They too are prisoners of their civil servants; just see what trouble our Prime Minister got into because he allowed the word Balochistan to stray into his joint statement with Yousaf Raza Gilani in Sharm-al-Sheikh. So heads of state are also cautious about flexibility, and nothing moves much in these international meetings. But they are nevertheless a very interesting instance of the rituals of modern society.        
	The major issue at this summit was, of course, the global economy; that is a very good subject for such international meetings just now. The world economy suffered a downturn; the commonly accepted remedy for that ailment is that governments should spend more. So the heads got together last year and agreed to go on a spending spree. Luckily for them, GDP has stopped falling in all major industrial countries  in India it has not had a chance of falling however much the government messes things up  so Pittsburgh was a good place to celebrate.         
	The minor subject was climate change. On this, Indias original position used to be that Indias per capita carbon dioxide emission is less than a tenth that of industrial countries, and that it would think of starting to reduce them when they rise to the level of industrial countries; that would give India a few decades to do nothing.        
	In other words, preventing global warming was the responsibility of industrial countries; India would watch happily while it continued to spew out more carbon dioxide. Then the Prime Minister got some pangs of conscience about this rather brazen, in-your-face position, which made him a pariah in every international meeting he went to. So under his leadership, India has refined its position in the past year.        
	It has made up a National Action Plan, decorated with a few national missions, to adapt to and mitigate climate change. It has decided to grow more trees, produce solar power, and take other obvious and not-too-costly action. It says it would be happy to do much more, like building nuclear power stations and increase industrial energy efficiency.         
	For these things it needs both investment and technology, which industrial countries possess. But it is not for itself that it is asking for these things; all developing countries need them. In this way, India has again become the champion of the poor and hapless developing countries that it was under Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi.         
	They did not go to nearly as many summits as Manmohan Singh; but they too heroically defended the interests of poor developing countries, and they got plenty of foreign aid  at least until Indira Gandhi liberated Bangladesh and enraged the Americans. It is the fashion these days to revile those Nehrus and Gandhis. But their historical roots led them to pious isolationism; it can be argued that they did right. I am sure it will be possible to make the same case for Manmohan Singhs isolationist brinkmanship.

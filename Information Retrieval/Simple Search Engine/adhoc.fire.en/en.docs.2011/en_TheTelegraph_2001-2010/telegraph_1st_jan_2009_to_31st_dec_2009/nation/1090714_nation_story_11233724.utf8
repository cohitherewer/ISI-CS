The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hooch deaths bring out a street fighter
                                                                                                               Hooch deaths bring out a street fighter
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Ahmed Patel                                  
	New Delhi, July 13: When Congress MPs from Gujarat sat on a dharna today before Mahatma Gandhis statue on Parliament premises to protest the Gujarat hooch tragedy, many in the party were surprised to see Ahmed Patel among them.        
	Sonia Gandhis political secretary had his confidant and the Congresss Gujarat co-ordinator, Rajeev Shukla, by his side. Patel, Sonias principal fire-fighter and Rajya Sabha MP  who is supposed to sleep just four hours  isnt known as a street fighter.        
	However, Patel had decided the Congress must go on the offensive and that he couldnt stay out, sources said.        
	Since he is not a minister, there was no way he would have stayed away from the dharna. Now is the time to signal to the people of Gujarat that the Congress is united, a source said.        
	A Congress Lok Sabha member from Gujarat explained: This was the right time for us to strike at (chief minister Narendra) Modi. Earlier, whenever we opposed him, he swung peoples sympathy towards himself. This time people are either apathetic towards him or openly resentful. Now it is for us to generate and sustain the momentum of the opposition.        
	However, what Patel and the senior leaders hadnt bargained for was the decision by a clutch of young Congress MPs from Gujarat to take the battle to the floor of the House.        
	These MPs marched towards the well of the Lok Sabha and forced Speaker Meira Kumar to adjourn ahead of the lunch break. Sonia was present.        
	They shouldnt have crossed the Lakshman rekha, a senior MP said. The strategy was later fine-tuned to avoid any more confrontations inside Parliament.        
	The sources also spoke of other triggers. One was the attack on Congress MLAs on a sit-in at the Gandhinagar secretariat by alleged BJP workers last week. Its impossible to enter the premises without a pass, but these people had a free run, said Rajya Sabha MP Pravin Rashtrapal.        
	Bharatsinh Solanki, MP from Anand and minister of state for power, accused Modi of being insensitive and said: No minister has visited the victims in hospitals or the families of the dead.        
	The Congress may have been emboldened to take a clear stand because the hooch deaths arent a religious issue. The party had dithered after the 2002 killings of Muslims, creating an impression that it didnt want to displease Hindus. Hindus and Muslims have both been consumed by the tragedy, Solanki said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, March 8: Nearly four months after a case of paedophilia came in Puri, the accused  an Australian doctor  has been granted bail by Orissa High Court.         
	The 65-year-old doctor was arrested for allegedly sexually harassing 11 boys of an orphanage.         
	The local court had rejected his first bail plea and he was put in judicial custody at the Puri district jail.         
	Alan Herbert Rose, alias Paul Allen, an eye surgeon, was working as a custodian of orphaned children living in a home run by Mary Ellen Gerber Foundation, a non-government organisation that runs the school-cum-home for adolescents.        
	He was arrested on November 12 in 2008 after the founder of the orphanage, Mary Ellen, lodged a complaint against the accused on November 5.         
	She had alleged that Paul Allen was sexually abusing the orphans.         
	Subsequently, police had filed a chargesheet in the court of the Puri sub-divisional judicial magistrate on January 10 against the Australian who had been allegedly continuously assaulting adolescent boys between the ages of 14 and 18 years over a period of five years.         
	If convicted, the doctor will have to serve up to 10 years in prison.         
	Police investigations had revealed that the doctor belongs to Bunbury in West Australia and was working in the orphanage since its inception in 2002.         
	Apart from the sexual charges, Paul Allen may also be proven guilty of not possessing valid legal documents for his stay in India.        
	He has been charged under various acts for sexually assault and harassment of minor, criminal conspiracy, and violating the Foreigners Act. He is also facing similar charges in the neighbouring state, Andhra Pradesh.         
	While the police was trying to gather all details to corroborate the sexual charges against him the accused had moved the high court.         
	A bench of single judge Justice R.N. Biswal allowed the doctor the bail petition on March 4 on the condition that he would surrender his passport, keep away from the orphanage and not leave the country.

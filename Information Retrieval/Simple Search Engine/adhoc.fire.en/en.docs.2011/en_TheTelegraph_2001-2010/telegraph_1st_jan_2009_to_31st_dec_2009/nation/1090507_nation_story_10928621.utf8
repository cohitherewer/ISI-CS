The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sonia setback to TN front
                                                                                                               Sonia setback to TN front
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sonia                                  
	Chennai, May 6: The stage was set for Sonia Gandhis only poll rally in Tamil Nadu, but the Congress chief cancelled her visit to Chennai and Pondicherry today, in a setback to the DMK-Congress fronts campaign.        
	She wanted to share the dais with Mr Karunanidhi in Chennai. But since doctors have advised the chief minister to remain under their care for a few days more, we may hold the Chennai meeting at a later date, Congress general secretary Ghulam Nabi Azad said.         
	DMK chief M. Karunanidhi has been in hospital since May 3 with urinary tract infection.        
	Campaigning in the state, which goes to the polls on May 13, will end on May 11.         
	The announcement of the cancellation came as final touches were being given to the dais at the Island Grounds near Fort St George, where the meeting was scheduled today.         
	 We are disappointed but if the two leaders can share the dais, then it would more than compensate the delay, state Congress president K.V. Thangkabaalu said.         
	However, fringe pro-LTTE groups that had planned to stage black flag demonstrations against Sonia claimed the cancellation as a victory. The Congress president was not prepared to face the wrath of the public of the state for her partys betrayal of Lankan Tamils, a Tamil Nationalist Front leader said.         
	Congress leaders said Karunanidhis hospitalisation was the only reason behind the cancellation.         
	The chief ministers sudden illness has handicapped the DMK-led front, which has been denied the services of its star campaigner.         
	On May 1, he flew to Tiruchy and addressed a public meeting. He returned to Chennai the next morning only to come down with back pain and high fever, after which he was admitted to hospital.         
	Karunanidhis meetings in Chennai on May 3 and Madurai on May 4 were cancelled, but he was hoping to be able to make it to the joint rally with Sonia today.         
	In his fathers absence, son M.K. Stalin has been shouldering the bulk of the campaign. Although a passable speaker, he does not match up to Karunanidhi in oratory or presence of mind in retorting to opposition charges.

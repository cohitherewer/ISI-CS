	Bangalore, Dec. 21 (PTI): Army personnel deployed on icy heights such as Siachen and Kargil can now look forward to savouring mutton and chicken biryani or non-veg sandwiches with none of the nutrients or taste lost during transit, thanks to a food laboratory.         
	The Mysore-based Defence Food Research Laboratory has prepared and packaged the dishes that have a shelf life of one year.         
	The products had been developed with the help of non-thermal technology, which helps retain nutrients and taste.

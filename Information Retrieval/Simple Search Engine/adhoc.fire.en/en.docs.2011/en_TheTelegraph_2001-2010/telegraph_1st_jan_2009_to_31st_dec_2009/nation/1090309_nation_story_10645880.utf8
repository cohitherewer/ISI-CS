                                                                                                               Singhdeo fresh salvo at Naveen
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack , March 8: Orissa Pradesh Congress Committee (OPCC) chief K.P. Singhdeo (in picture) came down on chief minister and BJD boss Naveen Patnaik heavily for taking the states people for a ride.        
	While development and industries had remained limited to memorandums of agreement, the promised goal of creating 10 lakh jobs in 10 years time has remained a dream, the leader has alleged.        
	The government that is gentle on criminals, needs to be ousted at any cost in the interest of the state, Singhdeo said, while exorting his partymen at a workers meet at Gopalpur here yesterday.         
	OPCCs working president Lalatendu Bidyadhar Mohapatra said the BJD-BJP government, led by chief minister Navin Patnaik, had put the state through nine years of misrule had pushed Orissa back by 20 years.         
	The states debt situation had gone up from Rs 18,000 crores in 2000 to Rs 42,000 crores in 2008, said Mohapatra, adding that a slew of populist measures is draining the state exchequer dry. The day is not far when the state exchequer will be hardpressed to pay the salary of its employees, Mohapatra added.        
	The leaders also alleged that in the past nine years the Naxalite menace had spread to 18 of the 30 districts in the state. While 76 policemen had fallen to rebel bullets, some 132 civilians were killed in red attacks. The OPCC working president accused Navin Patnaik government of having failed on all fronts.         
	The campaign committee chief of OPCC, Srikant Jena, underscored the need for taking up the issues with the people and said: The voters need to know that Navin Patnaik government was trying to take credit for implementation of programmes which are initiated and funded by the central government.        
	Left lauds Naveen        
	The Left Front, however, welcomes the BJD move of parting ways with the BJP in Orissa.        
	The CPM today said it was confident that more non-Congress or non-BJP parties would join the Left to forge a third alternative for the upcoming polls.        
	Two days ago, (BJP leader) L.K. Advani had pooh-poohed the idea of a third front and said India had a stable bi-polar polity. However, as much as the BJP and Congress insist, India is not happy with a bi-polar polity system, said CPM general secretary Prakash Karat.        
	Releasing the first list of 59 party candidates after a two-day meeting, Karat termed the BJD-BJP breakup as a good development.         
	After the Kandhamal attacks, the Left leaders had met BJD and warned leaders that it would be untenable for them to continue alliance with the BJP, knowing BJDs secular background. Karat said despite BJPs demand for dismissal of the Naveen government, the course for the governor is to call a session and test the majority on the floor.

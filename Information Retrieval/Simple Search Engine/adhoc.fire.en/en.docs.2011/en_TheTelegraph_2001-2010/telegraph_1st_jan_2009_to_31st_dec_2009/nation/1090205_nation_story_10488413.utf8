The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Suicide stunt in Andhra House
                                                                                                               Suicide stunt in Andhra House
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Dalit activists shout slogans on top of the Assembly building in Hyderabad on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	Hyderabad, Feb. 4: Dalit activists demanding categorisation of Scheduled Castes today rushed up to the terrace of the Andhra Assembly and threatened to jump over the parapet but were overpowered by securitymen and taken into custody.        
	About 26 activists of the Madiga Reservation Porata Sangam entered the building this afternoon, locked themselves in chambers of four ministers and raised slogans against chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy.        
	After security personnel forced open the doors of home minister K. Jana Reddys chamber and those of three others, many of the protesters raced up the stairs to the terrace.        
	The stunt proved mistimed as the Assembly had adjourned for the day around 11.30am after serial disruptions by Opposition parties. All legislators, including Speaker K.R. Suresh Reddy, had left.        
	All the agitators had entered the House with visitor passes, issued in the name of former marketing minister M. Mareppa. Mareppa, a Dalit, was forced to quit last year after the Congress lost the local body elections in his Kurnool district constituency.        
	The Speaker has sought a report on the incident. City police commissioner B. Prasada Rao, who visited the Assembly, was non-committal on whether there had been a security breach.        
	Everything will come out in the investigation, he said, adding that all the activists had been taken into custody.        
	The police and the Assembly security team have, however, begun wondering what would have happened had terrorists gained access to the House in the same way.        
	I shudder to think what would have happened if these Dalit activists were terrorists, a police officer said.        
	The Opposition Telugu Desam and the Telengana Rashtra Samiti have held the chief minister responsible for the incident. They claimed the activists had given vent to their frustration as they felt cheated because their demand had not been met.        
	This is not the first time that such an incident has happened in the Andhra Pradesh House. In 1987, youth Congress activists had gatecrashed the House and raised slogans against then chief minister N.T. Rama Rao for his allegedly unsavoury remarks on Rajiv Gandhi and the Congress high command.        
	The activists, led by P. Sudhir Kumar, were subsequently arrested and prosecuted. They had to spend a month in Musheerabad jail.        
	In 2007, Telugu Desam chief N. Chandrababu Naidu and his legislators had spent a night in the Assembly to protest the governments refusal to respond to corruption allegations.

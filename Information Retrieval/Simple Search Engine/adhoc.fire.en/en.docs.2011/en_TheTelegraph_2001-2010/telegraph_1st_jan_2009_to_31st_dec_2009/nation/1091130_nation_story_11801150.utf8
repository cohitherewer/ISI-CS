The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lalu barbs at Congress
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Lalu barbs at Congress
  - RJD chief pins hopes on hung Assembly in Jharkhand        NALIN VERMA      
	Patna, Nov. 29: Unlike his arch-rival Nitish Kumar who is concentrating more on Bihar, Lalu Prasad has all along been camping in Jharkhand, spearheading the RJD-LJP-Left campaign vehicle there.        
	However, in striking similarity with the Bihar chief minister, the RJD boss has been going hammer and tongs against the Congress. He sets out from a local hotel on Ratu Road in Ranchi to attend campaign meetings and then he goes on holding the Congress responsible for all ills.        
	Congress is responsible for rise of prices of essential commodities. It is the party of opportunists and selfish elements and is responsible for Jharkhands under development, Lalu Prasad screams at the rallies, making an impassioned appeal to the people never to vote for Congress.        
	While campaigning in Jharkhand, Lalu Prasad goes to the extent of pillorying the Congress more than even the BJP-led NDA. The Congress is an outfit of selfish elements. It believes in the politics of use and throw. I supported the Congress all along. Now it has ditched me, he says.        
	What is the politics behind Lalu Prasad bashing the Congress of late? A senior RJD leader close to the boss said: Lalu is trying to achieve two goals in Jharkhand. First, he wants a Congress debacle in the plateau state and secondly, he wants the RJD to get the kingmakers role in the event of a hung Assembly.        
	Lalu Prasad wants the Congress to bite the dust in Jharkhand to make the party realise the mistake of ignoring the secular forces ahead of the Assembly elections due next year in Bihar.        
	Lalu Prasad apparently feels that if the Congress gets a drubbing in Jharkhand it will be forced to have a tie-up with RJD-LJP and even the Left in the Assembly polls in Bihar.         
	Secondly, he is said to have sensed that fighting in alliance with the Left and LJP, the RJD will at least secure seats substantial enough to influence the government formation in the 81-member Jharkhand Assembly.        
	The RJD alone is contesting 56 seats, leaving 25 for the Left and LJP in the neighbouring state.         
	About Madhu Koda, the RJD boss gets angry and holds the Congress responsible for the Koda government. The UPA supported that government. You better ask the Congress, he says.        
	In a similarity with his rival Lalu Prasad, Nitish, too, is gearing up for a battle against the Congress. His party has launched a signature campaign against the Congress-led government at the Centre for the latters failure to accord special category status to Bihar.         
	The Congress has been responsible for the backwardness of Bihar. Be it infrastructure, road, use of Ganga water or coal linkage to Bihar-based power plant. The Congress party and its government at the Centre have been tendering a step-motherly treatment to Bihar, Nitish says at every available opportunity.

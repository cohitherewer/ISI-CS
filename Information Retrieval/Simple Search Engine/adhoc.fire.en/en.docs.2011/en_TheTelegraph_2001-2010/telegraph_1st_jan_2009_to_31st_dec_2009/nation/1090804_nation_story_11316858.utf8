	Cuttack, Aug. 3: Cuttack district collector Kishore Mohanty has sought a report in the alleged case of ragging that took place at Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (Mundali) in which a student was reportedly stripped.        
	The report came out in the local media today. Mohanty sought a clarification from the principal of the residential school, S.B. Rao, who did so around 2.30pm refuting allegation. Later, the collector fully endorsed the clarification.        
	As is apparent from the sequence of events explained by the principal, the media report contained unverified and half-baked sensationalised information, said Kishore Mohanty, talking to The Telegraph.         
	The girl was reluctant to stay in the school, so the alleged ragging could have been a ploy to make her parents take her away, Mohanty said, quoting the principals report.

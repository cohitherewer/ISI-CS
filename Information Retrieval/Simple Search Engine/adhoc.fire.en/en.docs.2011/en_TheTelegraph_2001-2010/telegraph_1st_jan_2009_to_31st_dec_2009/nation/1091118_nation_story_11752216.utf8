          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Nov. 17: Uma Bharti today met Kalyan Singh and indirectly backed his efforts to return to the BJP, saying she was happy he had realised that his earlier association with the Samajwadi Party was a mistake.        
	Both Uma and Kalyan are former BJP chief ministers from the Lodh caste, and Uma too is eyeing a return to the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) fold.        
	Uma met Kalyan at his home in Lucknow, where they spent an hour discussing each others plans.        
	Later, praising Kalyan as a seasoned leader, she said: When a leader like Kalyan Singh is honestly apologising for his earlier statements on the Ram temple and Ayodhya, it should be taken seriously.        
	During his alliance with the Samajwadis, Kalyan had regretted the Babri demolition, which happened when he was chief minister, but had stopped short of directly apologising for it.

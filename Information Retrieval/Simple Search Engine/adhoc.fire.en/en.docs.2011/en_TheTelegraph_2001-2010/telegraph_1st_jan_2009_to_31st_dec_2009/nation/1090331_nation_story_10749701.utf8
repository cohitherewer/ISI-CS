          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 30: The Supreme Court today suspended the principal of a Himachal Pradesh medical college where a student died after severe ragging this month.        
	Although Suresh Sankhyan had stepped down as the principal of Dr Rajendra Prasad Government Medical College, the court was not satisfied. The two-judge bench said the probe into Aman Kachroos death showed the casual approach and leniency of the principal and the warden in dealing with a serious matter. It is not in the interest of the college... that he should be part of the teaching staff.

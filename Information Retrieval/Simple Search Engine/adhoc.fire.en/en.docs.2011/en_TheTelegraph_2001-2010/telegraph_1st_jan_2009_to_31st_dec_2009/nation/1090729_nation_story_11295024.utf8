          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 28: The cabinet will decide the Centres stand in the Supreme Court on the Delhi High Court judgment decriminalising all consensual adult sex done in private, including gay sex.        
	We have prepared a note on the pros and cons of the judgment. It will be placed before the cabinet, said law minister Veerappa Moily after a meeting with home minister P. Chidambaram and health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad.        
	The three ministers had been assigned the task of framing the Centres response, to be articulated in the apex court on September 14. Sources said the Centre was unlikely to yield to religious pressure and oppose the high court verdict as that would make it look out of sync with the times. Last week, the Centre had opposed a stay on the judgment.

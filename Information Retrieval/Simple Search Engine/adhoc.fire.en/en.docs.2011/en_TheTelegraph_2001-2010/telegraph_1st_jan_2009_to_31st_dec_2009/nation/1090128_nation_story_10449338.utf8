	New Delhi, Jan. 27: IIT Delhi has readmitted 17 expelled students following a Supreme Court reprimand.         
	The 17, expelled in June 2008 on the ground that they had failed to maintain minimum academic standards, include nine SC students who allege caste bias. This is the first time any of the IITs has had to readmit expelled students after court intervention, an IIT official said.         
	The court, in an interim order on January 5, asked IIT Delhi to allow the students to attend classes. The IIT allowed the students to submit their fees, but told them it was petitioning against the order and would wait for the January 23 hearing.         
	On January 23, the court told the IIT to implement its interim order or face the possibility of contempt of court.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Azad apology to Rida mom 
                                                                                                               Azad apology to Rida mom 
                            
	Pune/New Delhi, Aug. 9 (PTI) Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad apologised today after suggesting that the first Indian to die of swine flu, 14-year-old Pune girl Rida Sheikh, may have infected 85 others while being shifted between three hospitals.        
	Ridas mother Shireen and aunt Ayesha had dubbed the comments irresponsible at a Pune news conference and demanded that Azad apologise or resign. I am asking him to name the three hospitals. He is being irresponsible, Shireen said.        
	Ayesha said Shireen had fainted after hearing the remarks. How can he say such a thing about a 14-year-old girl?        
	If she (Shireen) has misunderstood me, I am extremely sorry, Azad said in Delhi, adding that he had merely wanted to highlight the diseases contagious nature.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Go-it-alone   cry rises in Maharashtra 
                                                                                                               Go-it-alone   cry rises in Maharashtra 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                          Pawar                                        
	New Delhi, May 17: The Congresss spectacular performance in Maharashtra in the Lok Sabha elections has provided fresh ballast to calls within the state party to contest the October Assembly polls alone, leaving ally Nationalist Congress Party jittery.         
	The Congress has won 17 seats in the state, more than twice the eight the NCP has won, stunning many in Sharad Pawars party who were expecting to outperform the Congress.         
	The NCP tally is down by one seat from the nine it won in 2004, while the Congress has added four.         
	This performance vindicates the belief that the Congress does not depend on the NCP in much of the state. If we follow the Uttar Pradesh model instead, we will do even better, said a senior Maharashtra Congress leader, who belongs to a section within the party that had advocated fighting the Lok Sabha elections without an alliance with the NCP.         
	Amid pre-poll talks to stitch up seat adjustments in the state earlier this year, former chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh had publicly said party workers were keen that the Congress fight the elections alone. Today, Deshmukh repeated this at the Congress Working Committee meeting.        
	Although the Congress and the NCP have been partners in government both at the Centre and the state over the past five years, the relationship between their workers is tenuous.         
	Many in the state Congress, which has ruled Maharashtra for all but five years since Independence, believe the party should contest independently in the state rather than risk losing ground to the NCP.         
	That fear intensified after the NCP emerged the largest single party in the Maharashtra Assembly elections of 2004.         
	Pawars party won 71 of 124 seats it contested, outperforming the Congress that won 69 of the 157 it fought. The Shiv Sena won 62 and the BJP 56 in the House of 288 MLAs. The rest of the seats were won by Independents and smaller parties.        
	Where we didnt contest, several of our workers have shifted to the NCP because they felt they did not have any future in the Congress any more. This is weakening our party, a state Congress leader said.         
	Contesting all seats  like in Uttar Pradesh in these Lok Sabha elections  will also allow the party to take into account the demands of all communities for tickets.         
	In the general election, for instance, one cause for concern for the Congress in Maharashtra was a sense of anger among Muslim leaders because the party had offered the community only one seat  A.R. Antulay in Raigad.         
	Before yesterdays counting, a section of the NCP state leadership was expecting a rise in the partys seat count  a situation that would have strengthened its bargaining power with the Congress.         
	But now, party leaders fear that the Congresss state numbers may convince its central leadership to follow Deshmukhs suggestion and fight the Assembly elections alone.         
	The NCP is hoping that the support it offers to the Congress at the Centre will ensure that the alliance remains intact.         
	But at the Centre, the Congress, which has over 200 seats, would depend a lot less on the NCP. Unlike the Congress, the NCP does not have a strong base across the state and its leaders concede the partys prospects of winning the Assembly polls on its own are not bright.

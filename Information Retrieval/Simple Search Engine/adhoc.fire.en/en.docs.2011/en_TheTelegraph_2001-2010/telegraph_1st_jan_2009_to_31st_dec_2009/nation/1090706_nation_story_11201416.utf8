The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Three killed in China riots
                                                                                                               Three killed in China riots
                            
	Beijing, July 5 (Reuters): Three people were killed in rioting that erupted in Chinas restive far west Xinjiang region today, when protesters burned vehicles and blocked traffic in the regional capital Urumqi, the state news agency reported.        
	The regional government did not say how many people were involved in the unrest, but said they illegally gathered in several downtown places and engaged in beating, smashing, looting and burning, said the official Xinhua news agency.        
	The government sent police to disperse the crowd and arrested some rioters.        
	The dead were three ordinary people of the Han ethnic group, Xinhua said.         
	The official reports did not specify the ethnicity of those involved in the unrest, or the reasons behind it.        
	But a witness and other sources have told Reuters it involved members of the Uighur ethnic minority, many of whom resent the Chinese presence in the region, and the cultural and religious controls imposed by Chinas ruling Communist Party.

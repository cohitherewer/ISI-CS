          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 27: The CPM politburos final report on the proposed rectification drive in the party will be placed before the central committee, which will discuss it at its January 29-31 meeting in Calcutta.        
	Party leaders, however, said no deadline would be set to complete the rectification, which would start at the top and be an ongoing process.        
	The central committee will discuss the matter in January in Calcutta. Today, the politburo discussed how it will be implemented at its (own) level, Rajya Sabha member Sitaram Yechury said after a two-day politburo meeting ended here today. Rectification is an ongoing process. There is no time limit, Yechury added. He did not reveal the reports contents.        
	Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who attended the politburo meeting, said the drive would not end in one month or two months. It will go on.        
	The central committee had adopted a draft rectification document in October to cleanse the party of corruption and ideological deviations. The previous rectification document was adopted in 1996. It is being updated and new proposals with some dos and donts have been formulated, Bhattacharjee said.        
	He ruled out the same exercise to cleanse his cabinet. This (rectification) is an inner-party process. In the cabinet, we have other mechanisms to stop corruption.        
	The politburo held the governments food policies responsible for the price rise. The Left parties have planned an all-India rally against price rise during Parliaments budget session.

	Calcutta, Jan. 24: For Pritam Kaur, January 24 was a very long day as she joined hundreds of people praying for the health of Manmohan Singh at a gurdwara near the Alipore mint.        
	Kaur, a resident of Behala, was not just praying for the Prime Minister of the country but for her elder brother.        
	Pritam Kaur and her sister Govind Kaur, who is also a resident of Calcutta, along with their family members, attended the two-hour kirtan darbar conducted by Balbinder Singh Rangeela Chandigarhwale.        
	 We have been praying for a successful surgery. We were all very tense because this was my brothers second bypass surgery and things could have been complicated, said Pritam Kaur.        
	Over 400 people attended the prayer service for the Prime Minister that started at 8am at the gurdwara.         
	A small prayer service was also conducted at the residence of Pritam Kaur.         
	I am a little relieved now. I heard from my family that the operation was successful and he has been shifted to the CCU. Well be praying for his speedy recovery, Kaur said after the procedure at AIIMS was completed.         
	Late in the evening, both sisters attended a prayer service at a gurdwara in Rashbehari.        
	Everyone across the country offered prayers for his health and their prayers have borne fruit and the surgery was successful. We have come here to offer a prayer of thanksgiving, Pritam Kaur said.        
	Joining the family in prayer, like many others in the city, were Congress leader Idris Ali and the imam of Tipu Sultan Masjid who conducted a service at the masjid in Esplanade.        
	Members of the Congress state unit joined prayers at a gurdwara in Garcha at 9am.         
	We all gathered there to pray for the health of Manmohan Singh. We really hope that there will not be any complications, said Abhijit Mukherjee, a resident of Kalighat who attended the prayer service.

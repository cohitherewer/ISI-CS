The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ouster row in Stephens
                                                                                                               Ouster row in Stephens
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 29: The principal of St Stephens College has replaced a governing body member with election commissioner S.Y. Quraishi, drawing allegations that he violated the institutions constitution in a controversy that has split the college administration.         
	Ajay Singha, an ex-student of the college, has alleged that principal Valson Thampu illegally ended his membership on the St Stephens governing body to accommodate Quraishi and is threatening to approach the courts.         
	He has been supported in his allegations by several other members of the governing body, who argue that Singha has been removed in violation of the constitution of St Stephens.         
	But Thampu has rubbished the claims and has labelled the allegations mischievous.         
	It is a total and mischievous misrepresentation to insinuate that Mr Singha was removed, Thampu told The Telegraph via email.         
	Quraishi, when contacted, said he had no idea about any vacancies in the governing body and would not like to comment on Singhas allegations.         
	The controversy revolves around two posts on the governing body of the college  the first, a nominee of the principal, and the second, a representative of the St Stephens alumni.         
	Singha was appointed in 2008 by Thampu  in his capacity as principal  as his nominee on the governing body. Singha is also an alumnus of the college  he passed out in 1979.         
	The college constitution stipulates a three-year term for members of the body. It also states that members can only be removed by the body for willful neglect of duty, misconduct, insubordination, incompetence or the lack of physical or mental fitness.         
	The member is entitled to a notice from the body before he is removed, under the constitution.         
	But Singha has alleged that he was removed from the body within a year of his appointment  without even being informed.         
	I came to know when some friends informed me that the college website states that Quraishi has replaced me as a member of the governing body. This manner of removing a member illegally is extremely improper, Singha told The Telegraph.         
	Thampu, however, rejected Singhas claims and claimed that he was offered a one-year term as member, which he accepted with full knowledge.         
	The one-year term given to him simply expired and he ceased to be a member of the governing body. The question of sending him a notice does not arise for that reason, Thampu argued.         
	Thampu also argued that determining the tenure of the principals appointee is solely under the jurisdiction of the principal, suggesting that he did not need the governing bodys approval.         
	Singhas replacement by Quraishi follows attempts over the past few weeks by Thampu to induct the Election Commission in to the governing body as a representative of the St Stephens alumni, email correspondence between members reveals.         
	Thampus attempts were, however, resisted by others on the governing body. Under Bishop Sunil Singh, the college chairman, the governing body decided that it would consider a list of nominees  including Quraishi  for the post of member as an alumnus.         
	Quraishi has however been appointed as the principals nominee before the governing body could consider the list of nominees for membership as alumni representatives.

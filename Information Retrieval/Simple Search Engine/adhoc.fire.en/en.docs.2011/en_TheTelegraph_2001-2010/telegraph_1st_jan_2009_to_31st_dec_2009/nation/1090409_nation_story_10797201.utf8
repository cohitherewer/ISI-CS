The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Too Tight and Taut
                                                                                                               Too Tight and Taut
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                
	An errant debutant and his vandal tongue. A road-roller invoked as weapon to crush it. Another errant debutant and his vagrant ways. A gun stated as reason to prove it. A jail term for the former, banishment for the latter. Two women in merciless war over motherhood. Brothers-in-arms turning brothers-at-arms. Abuse flung as dare, petty cash as lure, and a shoe as anger for unassuaged agony.         
	The preparatory rites to the most sacred act of the worlds largest and most plural democracy can get pretty unceremonious. The already overburdened complaints register at the Election Commission offices is proof. Pious precept gets daily overridden by bad practice; nothing about the high principles of manifestos may come in the way of the low violations of practice. This is grab-as-grab-can time, it will have all the mud and blood of a scrum.                  
	Battles are by definition messy business. Even so, the one beginning to gather and let off steam now had rather neatly drawn contours till just a few weeks ago. Three defined formations seeking, by turn, continuity, change and an alternative to the former two  the Congress-led UPA, the BJP-led NDA and the third front at whose core lay the Left.         
	Then, quite suddenly, the battlements were snooker-shot into disarray. A triangular clash of titans became an explosion of skirmishes where theres no knowing whos hurting or helping who, no knowing friend from friend and foe from foe.        
	There do exist three major formations  the UPA, the NDA and the third front, which remains shy of calling itself that  but they exist more on paper, less on the ground which is teeming with confusion. So much that relatively small freelancers  unattached and semi-attached  like Mayavati, Lalu Prasad and Sharad Pawar cannot be ruled out as future contenders for the great gaddi.        
	There is nothing pre-poll about this election anymore, everything is up in the air till the verdict arrives on May 16. Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan, for instance, do not tire of paying obeisance to Sonia Gandhi and stating commitment to reinstalling Manmohan Singh as Prime Minister. But everywhere in Bihar, they are in cut-throat contest with Congress candidates.        
	The Congress, on its part, has demurred from burying the UPA, well aware that it cannot hope to retain power without support from the flanks, flapping and snapping though they are at the moment. But the compulsions of future necessity have not stopped the Congress from developing a bone of ambition rather late in the day  in deciding to contest most of the 120 seats from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, the party may have made too many demands on reality, resources and credibility.                  
	Many analysts argue that containing its aspirations pre-poll may have served the Congress better post-poll. Others contend that having been short-changed by allies in the two states, the party had no option but to go the whole reverse hog.        
	There may lie a paradox at the heart of the Congresss sudden expansion of ambition. In the context of the forthcoming election, it may be a wrong move because it may end up scattering and electorally hurting key allies. In the long term, however, the decision to contest the majority of seats may actually rekindle the partys dead roots in the heartland.        
	Sharad Pawar is another key ally who has kept the Congress sleepless, keeping post-poll options open wide, letting talk of his prime ministerial ambitions hang uncontradicted, indulging in eloquent equivocation on the possibility of his participating in a non-Congress, non-BJP experiment, openly allying with rivals such as Naveen Patnaik, who in a sense triggered the trend of collapsing alliances with his late hour jolt to the BJP in Orissa.        
	But as a coalition leader, the BJP had suffered earlier erosions, too  Jayalalithaa in Tamil Nadu and Chandrababu Naidu in Andhra Pradesh, both key one-time allies that have now crossed poles and joined hands with the Left.         
	The BJPs real headaches coming into campaign, though, lay essentially at home  in the vacuum left by the absence of the ailing Atal Bihari Vajpayee. For a critically long while now, the party has borne a divided-house image that L.K. Advani, the partys seniormost active leader and prime ministerial candidate, has not been able to do much about  the ego-spat in the party over the appointment of businessman and party factotum Sudhanshu Mittal to the apex election committee was evidence of the fact that the BJP is no more a party of cohesive control and command.        
	Similar dissonance has emanated on programme and policy  the party has spoken with different, often divergent, emphases on the Ram temple and Varun Gandhis hate speech, president Rajnath Singh evidently eager to push the hardline and Advani keen on moderation, which better serves his prime ministerial dreams. The BJP has spoken loudly of change, but what change it has not been able to articulate to the national constituency.                  
	The third front is offering an alternative to both larger parties but its own protagonists are aware they cannot get a handle on power without going with one of them. In that sense the parties of the third front will be central to government formation. And because the Left, however weakened they emerge from these elections, is a key part of the front, it will most likely be an arrangement minus the BJP.        
	But then, there are too many imponderables there, too. Much will depend on how many seats the Congress and the BJP individually secure. If, for instance, the latter is able to take its tally beyond the Congresss, it may be able to break the third front itself and wean away non-Left parties with the lure of power. If, on the other hand, the Congress keeps its lead over the BJP, the momentum will be on its side. However, numbers will be critical.         
	What leverage will the Congress have with the parties of the third front? Will the front get enough to demand a change in leadership, or, indeed, that one of them be made Prime Minister with the support of the Congress? Will the Congress have to give in to the front in the larger interest of putting a secular government in office? All of that will depend on digits that democracies turn on.        
	The battle for those digits has just begun to gather its fabled chaos, clamour and colour. Now on, theres no break. So keep watching. And pray terror imposes no interruptions.              
	THE STATE OF THE UNION        
	The political climate in the states after a month of deals and counter-deals and close to the first phase of polling        
	Uttar Pradesh
  Seats: 80        
	In 1999, it took the BJP to power and remains critical for the party in spite of the 2004 rout. A four-cornered contest among the BSP, SP, BJP and the Congress on paper, it will be a triangular fight in many seats with the Congress squeezed out. The BSP has the lead. A conservative estimate pegs the seats it could win at 30, but rivals fear Mayavati could net over 40        
	 Polling: April 16, 23 and 30, May 7 and 13        
	Maharashtra
  Seats: 48        
	In 1999, a Congress-NCP rift helped the Shiv Sena-BJP win 28, making their road to Delhi smooth. In 2004, the Congress-NCP won 22. This time, the Sena-BJP is hoping to break new ground among Dalits and Marathas but the rift between the allies could neutralise gains. Raj Thackerays split could also bite. The Congress-NCP has a slight edge        
	 Polling: April 16, 23 and 30        
	Andhra
  Seats: 42        
	Make-or-break state for the Congress and the third front. In 2004, the Congress-TRS won 37 seats, out of which the Congress had 29. The TRS and the Left are now with the Telugu Desam. If Chiranjeevis Praja Rajyam gets over 15% votes, the Congress will be in trouble. Party leaders from Telengana fear the tally could be cut to half        
	 Polling: April 16 and 23        
	Bengal
  Seats: 42        
	Since 1977, the Left Front has been the favourite in every election. Mamata Banerjee has aligned with the Congress, so the CPM will not be able to split the anti-Left votes. The Congress believes the Left tally will fall by 12-14 from its high of 35        
	 Polling: April 30, May 7 and 13        
	Bihar
  Seats: 40        
	Lalu Prasads RJD did well in 2004, but is on shaky ground now, which explains his rare generosity in giving 14 seats to Ram Vilas Paswan to forge a coalition of Yadavs, Muslims and Dusadhs. The NDA is counting on Nitish Kumars image and good governance. It also has the upper castes and a chunk of the non-Yadav middle castes behind it. The NDA has reason to be upbeat        
	 Polling: April 16, 23 and 30, May 7        
	Tamil Nadu
  Seats: 39        
	The DMK-Congress alliance, which swept the state in 2004, is looking slippery. As in Andhra, a poor showing in Tamil Nadu will cripple the Congresss prospects of return to power. Jayalalithaas front could get 30 seats        
	 Polling: May 13        
	Madhya Pradesh
  Seats: 29        
	The BJP, which won in the December 2008 Assembly polls, has a clear edge and could retain its 24 seats        
	 Polling: April 23 and 30        
	Karnataka
  Seats: 28        
	The BJP has gained at the expense of the Janata Dal and the Congress and is hoping to win 18 seats        
	 Polling: April 23 and 30        
	Gujarat
  Seats: 26        
	Narendra Modi rules the roost and the BJP is looking at winning 20 seats        
	 Polling: April 30        
	Rajasthan
  Seats: 25        
	The Congress won the December 2008 Assembly polls and the resentment against the last BJP regime is still fresh in public memory. The Congress is eyeing 20 seats, but factionalism and some weak candidates could restrict the tally to 16-18        
	 Polling: May 7        
	Orissa
  Seats: 21        
	The Congress is hoping to gain a few seats. Naveen Patnaiks decision to dump ally BJP will be put to test. For the NDA, Orissa is non-existent        
	 Polling: April 16 and 23        
	Kerala
  Seats: 20        
	Straight contests between the Congress-led UDF and the CPM-led LDF in all seats. The Congress hopes to increase its tally to 15        
	 Polling: April 16        
	Jharkhand
  Seats: 14        
	The Congress-RJD division could give the BJP an advantage. The Congress has a tie-up with the JMM, whose support base is dwindling fast        
	 Polling: April 16 and 23        
	Punjab
  Seats: 13        
	The Congress was hoping the Akali Dal-BJP alliance would be routed. But the NDA is cashing in on the shoe throw. The Congress could still better its 2004 tally of 2        
	 Polling: May 7 and 13        
	Chhattisgarh
  Seats: 11        
	The BJP hopes to repeat the sweep of 2004. It also won the December 2008 Assembly polls        
	 Polling: April 16        
	Haryana
  Seats: 10        
	The Congress won 9 seats in 2004. The BJP has tied up with Om Prakash Chautala, who is unpopular. But the Congress is likely to concede 2 or 3 seats because Bhajan Lal has broken away        
	 Polling: May 7        
	Delhi
  Seats: 7        
	The December Assembly poll win might suggest a repeat of the near-clean sweep of 2004 for the Congress, but the Jagdish Tytler-Sajjan Kumar row will have its impact. Likely verdict 4-3 in favour of the Congress        
	 Polling: May 7        
	J amp;K
  Seats: 6        
	Former ally PDP is out to damage the Congress in the Valley. A Congress-BJP-NC fight in the Jammu region        
	 Polling: April 16, 23, 30, May 7 and 13        
	Assam
  Seats: 14        
	The state gave the Congress 9 seats in 2004 but the party might have to pay an anti-incumbency price. The AGP-BJP tie-up and the presence of AUDF has added to its problems. Its tally could fall to 6        
	 Polling: April 16 and 23        
	Rest of NE
  Seats: 11        
	Congress faces an uphill task in a region it has dominated. Parties in Mizoram, Meghalaya,        
	Nagaland,Manipur and Sikkim have tied up with the NDA. The CPM is sitting pretty in Tripura        
	 Polling: April 16, 22, 23, 30         
	Compiled by Rasheed Kidwai

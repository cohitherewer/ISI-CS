          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, April 14: Claims made by the state unit president of the Hindu Jagaran Samukhya, Ashok Sahu, may land him in yet another tight spot.        
	On Octorber 8, 2008, Sahu had addressed a press conference and blamed seven members of a Kandhamal parish council for plotting the murder of Swami Laxmananda Saraswati.         
	Ajit Kumar Pradhan and six others had then filed a Rs 50-crore defamation suit against Sahu for accusing them. After the complaint, the court had asked Sahu to submit evidence supporting his claims by January 8, which he failed.         
	A court of the civil judge (senior division), which is adjudicating the defamation suit, yesterday indicated that it may pass an ex parte verdict if Sahu continues to evade submission of the evidence.         
	Sahu, who is contesting as the BJP candidate from Kandhamal, was arrested today for a hate speech delivered at a Raikia rally.

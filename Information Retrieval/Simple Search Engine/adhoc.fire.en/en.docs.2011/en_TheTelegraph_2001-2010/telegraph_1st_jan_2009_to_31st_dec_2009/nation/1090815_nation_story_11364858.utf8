          ANANYA SENGUPTA                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 14: The Punjab police basketball coach has gone into hiding after allegations that he tried to smuggle four men abroad by passing them off as team members, Delhi police said.        
	The alleged trafficking racket by Lakhvinder Singh, himself a police sub-inspector, was thwarted at Delhi airport but many others have succeeded  for years, Indian players have been disappearing during foreign trips by sports clubs.        
	A Delhi police officer said that when the Punjab police contingent for the World Police and Fire Games in Canada arrived at Delhi airport on August 2, the athletes were surprised to see four strangers among them.        
	At the counter, when the Punjab polices basketball team was receiving boarding passes, some players reported that four men in the queue werent part of their team, the officer said. They had valid visas and passports, though.        
	The four men  Hardip Singh, 26, Lakhbir Singh, 26, Jasvinder Singh, 30, and Taranjit Singh, 25  were taken to the airport police station where they admitted they werent policemen, the officer said.        
	They allegedly said Lakhvinder had taken Rs 12 lakh from each of them and provided them with visas, promising to help them reach Canada. The four men have been booked in fraud and criminal conspiracy cases.        
	When Lakhvinder saw the four men being apprehended, he didnt board the flight and fled the airport, the officer alleged. He called the airport the next day asking for a refund, but he didnt get it as we had already blocked his ticket. He is absconding but we will catch him soon.        
	Lakhvinder is posted in Jalandhar with the Punjab armed police. His family has told the Delhi police that he is in Canada, although there is a lookout notice against him at airports.        
	Delhi police sources said that five members of a womens cricket team from Jalandhar had disappeared during an England tour in 2003. Two years earlier, five players from a Mangalore-based cricket academy went missing after they landed in Adelaide, Australia, for a two-week coaching stint.        
	Many of these guys join clubs and coaching centres only to get visas and passports. Once they go abroad, they disappear. They do odd jobs and earn more money than they ever could playing club sports in India. This continues till the law catches up with them and they are deported, an officer said.              
	Bollywood stars maids too have been known to disappear during foreign trips, the latest to suffer being Malaika Arora while she was vacationing in London. Others to whom this has happened include Saif Ali Khan, Karisma Kapoor and Juhi Chawla.

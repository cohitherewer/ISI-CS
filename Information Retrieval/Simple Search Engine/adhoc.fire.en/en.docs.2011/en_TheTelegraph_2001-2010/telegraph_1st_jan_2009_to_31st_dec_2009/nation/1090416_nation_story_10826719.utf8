          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, April 15: The first phase of polling is likely to be disrupted in Naxalite-hit districts, as rebels have called a bandh tomorrow and started blocking strategic roads by felling trees.        
	However, inspector-general of police (law and order) Arun Sarangi said there was no reason to panic, as adequate central paramilitary forces had deployed in the vulnerable areas.        
	Inspector-general of police (operations) Sudhansu Sarangi is camping at Malkangiri to oversee the security for tomorrows polls, he said.         
	Road communication has been hit badly most in Malkangiri bordering Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Roads that were blocked last night include Gobindpali Ghat Road, connecting district headquarters of Koraput and Malkangiri.         
	Roads leading to important places in Malkangiri such as Kalimela, Motu, Chitrakonda and MV-79 were also blocked by tree felling. Some of the roads were also dug up by Naxalites, reports said.        
	Malkangiri collector Nitin Bhanudas Jawale said road communication had been disrupted at few places, making it difficult for polling parties to reach their destination. He, however, said that efforts were on to clear the blocked roads with help of Orissa Disaster Rapid Action Force and central paramilitary forces.        
	One helicopter has also arrived at Malkangiri to transport the polling parties and voting materials to inaccessible booths, especially those located beyond the Balimela reservoir.         
	Malkangiri police superintendent Satyabrata Bhoi said that adequate security had been provided to the polling parties at vulnerable pockets.         
	However, sources said polling personnel were reluctant to be escorted by the police since they were targeted more.         
	Chief electoral officer Alaka Panda said the administrations concerned were taking all steps to ensure staff safety. Arrangements are being made in places where polling parties are finding it difficult to reach destinations because of blockade, she said, adding that three choppers have been engaged in Maoist-hit areas.

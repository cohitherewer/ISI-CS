	Patna, March 12: Even as chief minister Nitish Kumar, railway minister Lalu Prasad and their respective party cadre stayed away from celebrating Holi to express solidarity with the flood victims of the states Kosi region, bloodshed spoiled Holi fun in the state yesterday.         
	Alleged CPI(Maoist) rebels killed a JD(U) leader at Prashanto village in eastern Bihars Munger district after a rebel-sponsored kangaroo court branded him a police informer.         
	In another incident, two men were shot dead and 28 injured in clashes among Holi revellers in north Bihars Saran district yesterday.         
	Police sources said that about 100 rebels raided Prashanto village last night dragging Manoj Singh (40), the president of the Khadagpur block unit of the JD(U) to the nearby main road where the peoples court awarded him a death sentence.         
	Munger superintendent of police M.S. Nayak said that extremists slit Singhs throat with sharp weapons and left him to bleed to death on the streets. The police have sent the body for postmortem.         
	Eyewitnesses said the Naxalites then disappeared into the thick forest adjoining the village shouting comrade Mao zindabad.         
	The Naxalites left behind a leaflet accusing Singh of defying the peoples diktat and acting as a police informer.         
	A strong contingent of police force has been deployed at the village in view of the prevailing tension. Raids are on to apprehend the culprits, the Nayak said.        
	Meanwhile, Govind Yadav and Narayan Yadav were killed in the clashes that followed an argument over the throwing of mud on people during Holi in Asani village, about 90km from here. Eight others were injured in the fight. Police said 20 people were also injured in clashes following a quarrel over throwing coloured water in a village of the same district.         
	On the eve of Holi, a man was shot dead when the act of uprooting a tree for the Holika dahan ritual turned violent in a village of south Bihars Nawada district.        
	The police nabbed over 100 Holi revellers driving wildly on Patna streets and in adjoining areas on Wednesday.         
	The police also patrolled the streets and forced the closure of shops selling beetle leaf, soda and cigarettes doing the business till late in the night.         
	Officially, the administration had declared a dry day yesterday ordering closure of all liquor shops in the Bihar capital.         
	But booze  an integral part of Holi celebrations, according to many  was easily available near the Patna junction railway station and Raza Bazaar area.

	Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi has ducked a question on the relationship between his son Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor.         
	You better ask Saif and Kareena about their marriage plans instead of me. They would tell about it in a better way. They are mature. Nowadays children dont listen to parents, the former Indian cricket captain said in Bhopal.         
	The scion of the erstwhile ruling family of Bhopal arrived in the town with actress-wife Sharmila Tagore on Saturday for a private function and to resolve property disputes.

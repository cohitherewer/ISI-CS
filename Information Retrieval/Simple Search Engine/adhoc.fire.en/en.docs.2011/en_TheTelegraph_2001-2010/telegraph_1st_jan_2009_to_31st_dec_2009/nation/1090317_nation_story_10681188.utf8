  - Science research takes off but it may be years before desired outcomes are visible					 					        VALUE JUDGEMENT      Science and Technology      G.S. MUDUR                                                
	New Delhi, March 16: India developed corn with milk protein, turned on a mid-sea factory churning a million litres of seawater into pure drinking water each day, and celebrated its success-at-first-try lunar orbiter during the UPAs five years.        
	But a pledge to raise Indias research spending to 2 per cent of the GDP has remained unfulfilled. Embarrassing delays dogged scientific projects, and desired outcomes of key government initiatives to spur science and innovation may not become visible for years to come.        
	Whether it was hatched with intent or emerged rather spontaneously, the mantra for government departments associated with scientific activities appeared to be to invest for the future.        
	They had their share of feats and flops, but much of their activities appeared focused on laying only foundations for the future.        
	Indias recovery of a space capsule in 2007 and the lunar orbiter mission in 2008 were two crucial steps towards its pursuit of deep-space exploration and manned missions.        
	However, the Indian Space Research Organisations success with the Chandrayaan-1 was tempered by the failure of the W2M, Indias heaviest satellite built for a foreign customer.        
	The Nuclear Power Corporation added two giant, 540MW indigenous nuclear power reactors in Tarapur, but its plants ran short of fuel. Also, it encountered criticism from the Comptroller and Auditor General for watering down its requirements of uranium fuel.        
	But the government  working through nuclear scientists and diplomats and more than three years of negotiations with the US  successfully steered India into a new dawn of commercial nuclear relationships with the West.        
	The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) expanded a programme to develop globally competitive leadership technologies, but many projects pursued during the first phase of the programme are yet to go commercial.        
	For instance, a molecule touted four years ago by the CSIR as a major breakthrough in the treatment of an infectious disease is still not in the market.        
	However, departing from convention, science departments appeared to be engaged more in public outreach during 2004-09 compared with earlier years. Science and technology minister Kapil Sibal may have influenced this willingness to engage.        
	Sibal encouraged officials from the CSIR, biotechnology and earth sciences to explain how their departments were spending taxpayers money. The lists of their pursuits made it easier to track successes as well as failures.        
	Biotechnology officials unveiled a designer corn tailored to contain protein whose quality approaches that of milk. Earth sciences department officials displayed a million-litre-a-day desalination plant off the Chennai coast.        
	Some projects emerged from Sibals enthusiasm to apply technology to real-world problems  for instance, the use of information technology to reduce chances of witnesses recanting statements in court or the use of security technologies for surveillance in urban centres.        
	But even these projects have yet to pan out into visible solutions for the problems they intended to address.        
	The government supported Indias first science mission to the Arctic zone, but the value of science outcome through that mission is still unclear. Even less clear is the benefit to Indian science from Sibals visits to Antarctica in 2005 and an Arctic station in 2008.        
	But the impacts of new projects, policies and institutions created or announced during the 2004-09 period are likely to be experienced post-2009.        
	The department of science and technology launched a plan called Inspire to lure high school students away from medicine and engineering towards pure science degrees by offering them up to Rs 80,000 a year in scholarships.        
	Whether Inspire will indeed stem or even reverse the trend of some of the best students turning towards professional courses or management or information technology will become clear only over the next five years, perhaps longer.        
	India also awaits the fruits of a plan to modernise the India Meteorological Department through a Rs 1,000-crore funding for better weather data instrumentation, analysis and human resources. The first of the improved forecasts may be expected to coincide with the Commonwealth Games in 2010.        
	The government approved a Science and Engineering Research Board, justifying the creation of this new science-funding agency by arguing India needed a super think tank that would think big and co-ordinate across different scientific departments.        
	But only time will tell whether the board would truly follow its mandate or begin to function just as other science-funding agencies of the government do.        
	As its term drew to a close, the UPA government also approved changes in rules to unshackle academic and public-funded researchers to allow them to hold equity in private technology companies.        
	This is an incentive to push lab-level technologies towards the marketplace. The hope is that in the years to come, it will improve the dismal record of successful technology transfer from universities and laboratories to industry.        
	Newly created institutions  such as a climate change centre in Pune, a health sciences and technology centre in Faridabad and a medical genomics centre in Kalyani have also raised expectations of high-quality science and applications of technology. But an exercise to assign performance grades to them will also have to wait.

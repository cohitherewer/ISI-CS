The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lifer cops get no reprieve
                                                                                                               Lifer cops get no reprieve
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 18: Delhi High Court today upheld the life sentences given to 10 policemen, including an assistant commissioner of police, for the murder of two businessmen in a fake encounter in Connaught Place in 1997.        
	Encounter specialist ACP S.S. Rathi had appealed in the high court against the life sentence handed to him by a lower court in October 2007.         
	A Delhi police Crime Branch team led by Rathi had on March 31, 1997, fired indiscriminately at Haryana-based businessmen Pradeep Goyal and Jagjeet Singh, mistaking them for Uttar Pradesh-based gangster Md Yasin and his accomplice.        
	The nine others convicted are inspector Anil Kumar, sub-inspector Ashok Rana, head constables Shiv Kumar, Tejpal Singh and Mahavir Singh, and constables Sumer Singh, Subhash Chand, Sunil Kumar and Kothari Ram.         
	R.K. Naseem, the lawyer for Mahavir Singh, said: We will certainly appeal in the Supreme Court. My client, who has been accused of firing the shot that killed one of the businessmen, has said that he had fired in the air to disperse the crowd gathered around the place.         
	Goyals wife Neema said she was happy that justice had been done. She had earlier sought death penalty for the accused policemen.         
	We have been fighting the battle for 12 years. I am happy and satisfied that all our hardships have borne fruit. The vacuum in my life will never be filled but if the outcome is satisfactory then all hardships are forgotten, Neema said.         
	In his appeal in the high court, Rathi had claimed that he was not present during the firing that killed businessmen Goyal and Singh.        
	Rathi had claimed that there was no conspiracy to kill the businessmen. He said he had asked the police party to use minimum force to arrest Md Yasin.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Teachers blame Delhi school for stampede
                                                                                                               Teachers blame Delhi school for stampede
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           Students at the Delhi school after the stampede. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 14: Some teachers of the government school where a staircase stampede killed five girls have blamed the management, saying they ignored complaints that the stairs were built with poor material and turned slippery after rain.        
	The teachers have also given it in writing to police that the staircase had no light bulbs, nor did enough sunlight reach it, police sources said.        
	The allegations are part of teachers written answers to a questionnaire distributed by the police to pinpoint the reasons for Thursdays stampede at Government Boys/Girls Senior Secondary School in Khajuri Khas, northwest Delhi.        
	The 9am stampede happened after school authorities suddenly changed the exam sitting arrangements for 5,000 students, triggering mayhem on the schools lone, 4.5-foot-wide staircase as boys and girls raced to reach their new exam rooms.        
	The teachers answers reveal that school authorities had been warned that the newly constructed staircase had been built with poor material. As a result, sand kept coming out of it and, during rain, turned the steps slippery.        
	It had rained the morning of the tragedy, forcing a change in the cramped schools plans to have most of the students sit the exam outdoors.        
	One teacher wrote the staircase lacked lighting (there was a power cut during the stampede, though).        
	A deputy commissioner who is leading the probe handed the questionnaire to about 300 people, including neighbourhood residents and students parents.         
	So far, at least 72 people  including teachers, other school staff and the principal and vice-principal  have handed in their answers.        
	One teacher, who refused to be named, said she had mentioned in her answers how the school had violated norms set by the National Building Code of India, which regulates private and public construction country-wide.        
	The code says a school must have at least two staircases. It also says staircases should have railings and not walls on both sides, she said.        
	The fact is, most state-run and municipal schools are in dilapidated condition, so this kind of incident will keep happening unless schools are given funds (for maintenance and improvement).        
	One teacher said a request had been sent to the authorities for the construction of a new staircase. The teachers have dismissed initial claims by some girls parents that the stampede was triggered by boys trying to molest girls.         
	Delhi education minister Arvinder Singh Lovely denied the school building was in poor shape. The building is in good condition and the stairs are five feet wide. The probe report will reveal the reasons behind the stampede, he said.        
	The probe panel, which was to hand its report to the Lt Governor yesterday, failed to do so even this evening.        
	The state education department has brought in experts to counsel traumatised survivors of the stampede. The school, closed since the tragedy, reopens tomorrow.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rebel ambush kills 9 jawans
                                                                                                               Rebel ambush kills 9 jawans
          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, April 10: Heavily armed Maoist guerrillas today ambushed a patrolling party of CRPF forces, killing nine jawans, including an officer, in insurgency-hit Dantewada district.         
	The ambush is seen as a move by rebels to disturb the election process in the state that goes to polls on April 16.         
	Eight CRPF troopers were also injured in the Naxalite attack.         
	Dantewada superintendent of police Rahul Sharma said that jawans of the 55th battalion of the CRPF were patrolling in the forests of Kotampalli when Maoists ambushed the force near Minta  about 200km from district headquarters of Dantewada and 450km south of the Chhattisgarh capital.         
	Sharma said nine CRPF men, including deputy commandant Diwakar Tiwari, were killed while eight other personnel received bullet wounds in the gun battle that lasted for more than three hours. The exchange of fire ended at 4pm, he added. The injured included an assistant commandant of CRPF.         
	A senior official in the police headquarters here said that it was a meticulously planned attack as the rebels cordoned off the area from all corners soon after the jawans walked into their trap.         
	The rebels opened fire indiscriminately from all corners that gave little room to the jawans to take up position and return the fire, the official added.         
	While most of the jawans immediately fell to the bullets of rebels, the remaining jawans gave a befitting reply and engaged the Maoists for more than three hours before the enforcement reached the spot.         
	The rebels, however, slipped into the forests before additional forces came for help. Sources said more than 125 armed rebels were involved in the operation against 24 jawans.         
	The Maoists were heavily armed with AK-47 rifles and other sophisticated weapons.         
	The injured jawans were brought to Dornapal from where they were airlifted to Jagdalpur town. They were admitted to Maharani hospital where the condition of three jawans was reported to be critical.

	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 9: The state government has earmarked Rs 50 crore for the International Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) in Bhubaneswar.        
	This was announced by chief minister Naveen Patnaik while inaugurating the technical hub and its permanent campus here today. The government, Naveen reminded, had allotted 23 acres for the campus and renewed its commitment to provide support to make the institute a centre of excellence.         
	The institutes foundation stone was laid by then President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam in November 2006. IIIT-Bhubaneswar, is a flagship project of the government, similar to ones at Bangalore and Hyderabad. Stating that his government has adopted a two-pronged strategy to position Orissa as a favoured destination for higher education in the country, Naveen said: We are requesting the Centre to give a fair share of centrally-funded institutes. My government is also investing its resources to create institutes of excellence such as the IIIT, National Law University and Entrepreneurship Development Institute.        
	This hub should play a role in evolving a positive IT environment, said Naveen, adding: Our government has adopted IT as a means to make the administration responsive, transparent and effective. Let the IIIT emerge as a R amp;D laboratory for e-governance. Stating that IT sector has produced a new breed of entrepreneurs, Naveen expected IIIT to produce its share of entrepreneurs, who would create employment for others.

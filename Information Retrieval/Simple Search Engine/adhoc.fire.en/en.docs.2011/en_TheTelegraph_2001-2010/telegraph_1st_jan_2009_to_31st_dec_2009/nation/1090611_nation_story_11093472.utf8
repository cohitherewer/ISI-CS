          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, June 10: Orissa High Court has decided to monitor security for the Puri rath yatra on June 24 when nearly 10 lakh devotees are expected to congregate in the pilgrim town.        
	A division bench of acting Chief Justice I.M. Quddusi and Justice Sanju Panda will review the measures on June 18 during the course of hearing a PIL, court sources said.        
	Cuttack-based socio-cultural organisation Maitree Sansad had filed a PIL seeking judicial intervention for proper security measures in Puri for rath yatra.        
	The petition had pointed out that six devotees, including three women, were killed and around 20 injured in a stampede when the deities were being taken in their respective chariots on July 4 last year. Another devotee was killed in a stampede during the Suna Vesha ritual nine days later.         
	The stampedes apparently took place when the devotees jostled to catch a closer glimpse of the deities.        
	Taking note of it, the vacation court had yesterday directed the state government to file an affidavit on June 18 giving specific details on the steps taken to prevent recurrence of such incidents.         
	The petition has also raised questions about the vulnerability of the Orissa coastline to terrorist incursions during the festival.         
	Director-general of police M.M. Prajaraj had announced that tight cordons around the three chariots manned by two companies of Rapid Action Force and the newly raised Orissa Special Security Force would be part of the special security arrangements to prevent recurrence of stampedes.        
	No one, not even VVIPs, would be allowed to go near the inner cordon, Prajaraj clarified.        
	The special security arrangements also include anti-terrorist squads, bomb disposal squads with sniffer dogs and closed-circuit television cameras at strategic points to keep a tab on the crowd. Besides, the coast guard has been urged to step up surveillance along the 480km long coast.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                        Girija Vyas (top), Advani				                                       
	New Delhi, June 5: Winner Congress rubbed it in, loser BJP swallowed its pride and made meek conciliatory noises.        
	During the 15th Lok Sabhas first debate today, Congress MP Girija Vyas made fun of L.K. Advanis prime ministerial ambitions and condemned the strident campaign speeches by Varun Gandhi and Narendra Modi.        
	Leader of the Opposition Advani, however, seemed to have lost his stomach for a fight following the deflating poll defeat. He appealed for a cordial relationship with the government and even said the electoral verdict was a vote for stability and had enhanced Indias prestige.        
	The Left didnt escape the Congresss barbs, either, with Kerala MP P.C. Chacko congratulating the voters for teaching a lesson to those who claimed the right to lecture the world.        
	Vyas, moving the motion of thanks to the Presidents address, said the BJP had tried to mislead voters with its Prime Minister-in-waiting propaganda, just as it had done with its India Shining campaign in 2004.        
	Advani chose to ignore the taunt and congratulated Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh and Pranab Mukherjee on the Congress victory. He hoped a new chapter in government-Opposition co-ordination would unfold and have a positive influence on Parliaments functioning.        
	This was in stark contrast to the BJPs confrontationist attitude after the shock defeat in 2004, when it repeatedly disrupted proceedings, not allowing even the Prime Minister to speak in peace in Parliament for almost two years.        
	The closest Advani came to making a dig today was when he reminded the Congress of its sharp fall after Rajiv Gandhis record victory in 1984. He then shifted quickly to the Mumbai terror attack, probably deciding it was the only issue he could try and corner the government on.        
	The Congress, however, was not willing to show any mercy. Chacko heaped scorn on the BJP over the Kandahar hijack, and Bengal MP Adhir Chowdhury cited Advanis ludicrous decision to lift weights in a gymnasium during the weak PM debate.        
	Chacko also targeted the Left, expressing relief that the government could now push through economic reforms without unreasonable pressures. He then cited how ideologically inflexible people had been taught a lesson.        
	When this provoked the CPMs Basudev Acharya to intervene, Chacko asked him to advise the Bengal government to at least provide water and food to the cyclone victims.        
	Chacko said the Left had been criticising Manmohan since he was P.V. Narasimha Raos finance minister, and wondered how the communists had failed to see even now that the reforms had improved Indias economic health.

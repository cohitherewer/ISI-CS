          OUR BUREAU                          Passengers at a Jet Airways ticket counter in Mumbai on Tuesday. (Reuters)                                  
	Sept. 8: The civil aviation ministry has spoken of invoking a tough law under which sick Jet pilots can be arrested but the government is wary of pushing too hard.        
	The ministry is in a dilemma about how to handle the situation. Jet chief Naresh Goyal is lobbying hard to get the government on his side. But the government is also aware that it cannot deny the pilots the right to organise themselves.        
	Air India, too, has a pilots guild. Many within the government have pointed out that the pilots right to form an association cant be denied merely because they are considered white-collar employees.        
	Technically, only blue-collar workers can form unions but white-collar employees get around the problem by calling their organisations associations or guilds.        
	At the root of the problem is the dismissal of two pilots last month for forming an association. The Jet pilots body, National Aviators Guild (NAG), has called the dismissals  three more pilots were sacked today  blackmailing to disband the union in exchange for reinstatement of the sacked pilots.        
	This is not at all acceptable to us, NAG president Girish Kaushik said.        
	Goyal today met civil aviation secretary M. Madhavan Nambiar. Although the Union government has cited consumer interest to involve itself in efforts to end the agitation, it has stayed away from invoking the Essential Services Maintenance Act (Esma). The ministry may wait a day before going ahead with the extreme move.         
	Something is happening. Let us wait, Nambiar said. The ministry has asked striking pilots to meet civil aviation regulator DGCA.        
	Nambiar said he had also advised Jet to start negotiating with its pilots. The ministry can only facilitate... it is the management which has to sort this out.        
	The civil aviation secretary said his ministry had asked the airline to set up control offices at their headquarters, bases, offices and airports. It has also been asked to put in place a full refund mechanism without any deduction.        
	Jet officials said they had to cancel four out of 29 flights from Calcutta airport while four others were combined.         
	Shivangini Aurora, an NRI, is scheduled to take a Jet Airways flight from London to Calcutta through Mumbai on September 10. We are very worried about whether she would be able to reach. We have contacted the Jet officials but they could not give us any assurance, said her mother Sarita in Calcutta.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nepal alleges higher education fee bias
                                                                                                               Nepal alleges higher education fee bias
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                          Sujata Koirala                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 18: Nepal has complained to India that several higher educational institutions here are charging its students higher fees on a par with other foreign students in violation of an agreement between the two countries.        
	On the eve of Prime Minister Madhav Nepals visit to India, the Himalayan nations foreign minister Sujata Koirala wrote to her Indian counterpart S.M. Krishna complaining of the alleged violation, top officials told The Telegraph.         
	Madhav Nepal, too, is expected to raise his countrys concerns during his meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tomorrow, sources indicated. Nepal is also expected to ask Singh to increase the number of scholarships India offers its students.        
	Although India does not maintain a central database of international students, officials estimate that at least 20,000 Nepalese students join the higher education system every year.         
	Most higher education institutions in India, including those run by the central or state governments, charge differential fees, with foreigners having to fork out significantly higher amounts.         
	At the Jawaharlal Nehru University, for instance, Indian research scholars  those pursuing MPhil or PhD  are charged Rs 240 as tuition fees annually. It is Rs 216 annually for undergraduate, MA and MSc courses.         
	But foreign nationals pay $750 (Rs 36,000) per semester, or $1,500 (Rs 72,000) per year, for science courses. It is $500 (Rs 24,000) per semester, or $1,000 (Rs 48,000) annually, for courses in social sciences.        
	Although prospectuses of many universities do not specify any fee relaxation for students from Nepal, government sources confirmed that students from that nation have been traditionally charged fees like Indian students under a broad educational agreement.         
	Koirala has alleged that several higher education institutions, mostly in the private sector, have started charging students from Nepal like those from other foreign countries which they often cannot afford, according to the sources.        
	Concerned, the ministry of external affairs has asked the human resource development ministry to examine Nepals complaint.         
	The HRD ministry has, in turn, asked the UGC to investigate which institutions are charging higher rates so that action can be taken against them, the sources said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP erupts, Cong quiet
                                                                                                               BJP erupts, Cong quiet
          OUR BUREAU                           Digvijay                                 
	New Delhi, Jan. 31: The Congress refused to comment on the chief election commissioners recommendation for his colleagues removal, saying it would not like to politicise constitutional offices, but the BJP went all out to push for Navin Chawlas dismissal.        
	BJP general secretary Arun Jaitley said election commissioner Chawla should not be part of preparations for the general election.         
	If there are reasons to believe that a person suffers from political bias, he is unfit to be a member of the Election Commission. His continuation as a member will subvert the holding of free and fair elections, Jaitley told a news conference.        
	The party would take the issue to appropriate forums, he said.         
	The BJP has been fighting for Chawlas removal on grounds of conflict of interest, alleging he is close to the Congress. It submitted a memorandum of over 200 MPs to then President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam in 2006 seeking his dismissal. When nothing came of it, the party went to the Supreme Court.         
	In August 2007, chief election commissioner N. Gopalaswami told the court he had the authority to act on a petition seeking an election commissioners dismissal. The BJP then withdrew its Supreme Court petition and filed one before Gopalaswami in January last year.         
	Jaitley demanded that Gopalaswamis recommendation be made public. In his letter to the President, the chief election commissioner is believed to have said the recommendation of Chawlas removal was based on his own assessment of his colleague in office.        
	Congress general secretary Digvijay Singh said: We have always opposed the BJPs attempts to politicise the offices of constitutional authorities. No party can react to media reports especially concerning such a sensitive issue. We dont know what the content of the letter is.        
	Congress sources said the BJPs canards against Chawla had already fairly hobbled him.        
	When its time for him to take over as the chief election commissioner, we are afraid he may be immobilised by the BJPs campaign and lose the capacity to think and act independently, a source said.         
	Chawla is to take over when Gopalaswami retires in April.        
	The Congress is also worried the BJP will use the issue to stall Parliament.

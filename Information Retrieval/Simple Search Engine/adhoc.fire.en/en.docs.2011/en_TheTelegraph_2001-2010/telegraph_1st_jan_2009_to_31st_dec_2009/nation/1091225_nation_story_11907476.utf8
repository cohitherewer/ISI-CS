          CITHARA PAUL                          A sketch of David Headley                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 24: The Centre has decided to relax tourist visa rules, tightened in the wake of terror suspect David Headleys arrest, after complaints from the US and the UK and concerns of a drop in visitors numbers.        
	To facilitate bona fide tourists, it has since been decided that foreigners holding tourist visas who, after initial entry into India plan to visit another country and re-enter India before finally exiting, may be permitted two or three entries by Indian missions, a spokesperson for the ministry of external affairs said this evening.        
	However, permission to re-enter will be granted on the submission of a detailed itinerary and supporting documents such as ticket bookings, the official said.        
	The changes, prompted by revelations that Pakistani-American Headley and his associate Tahawwur Rana had visited India on multiple-entry visa, barred a tourist who had spent 90 days or stayed more than 180 days in the past year in India from returning within two months of exit. Headley has been charged by the FBI with conducting the recce for the Mumbai attack.        
	Britain and the US protested the new rules, saying they were creating problems for their travellers. The US even issued an advisory asking its citizens to review their travel plans to India. Its embassy also posted on its website complaints from travellers.        
	Back home, the tourism ministry had requested the home ministry, which tightened the rules, to make the new norms flexible.        
	Genuine tourists who provide detailed travel plans must be exempted from the new visa rules. If the home ministry is not co-operative, our ministry is plans to approach the Prime Minister, a tourism ministry official had said.        
	The tourism industry, he said, has begun to show signs of recovery after the twin blows of last years Mumbai attack and the economic crisis. We were hoping the scenario will bounce back in the current season. But with this new visa regulations, the things look bleak, if not terrible, the official said.         
	He added that it was ironic the clampdown had come at a time the government introduced a visa-on-arrival scheme for tourists from Singapore, Japan, New Zealand, Luxembourg and Finland.

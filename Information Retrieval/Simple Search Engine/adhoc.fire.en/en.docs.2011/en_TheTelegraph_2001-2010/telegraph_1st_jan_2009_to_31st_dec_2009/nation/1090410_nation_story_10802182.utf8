The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Whats in a ticket? Hang him, says 1984 widow
                                                                                                               Whats in a ticket? Hang him, says 1984 widow
  - Court defers hearing of plea to close case, asks for CDs containing evidence        ANANYA SENGUPTA                           Women protest outside the Karkardooma courts                                        
	New Delhi, April 9: Kuldeep Kaur saw her husband being burnt alive by a mob during the 1984 riots, and she couldnt care less if Jagdish Tytler has lost his election ticket.        
	I want him hanged. I want to see him die. Whats in a ticket? He will continue to live his life, while we have none, said the widow, who was left with three small children to bring up alone when the mob killed her husband 25 years ago.        
	The narrow bylane leading to Block 32 in Trilokpuri, where Kuldeep was witness to her husbands death, saw as many as 350 Sikhs killed.         
	No one who has lived to tell the tale from the east Delhi neighbourhood that was home to mechanics, drivers and carpenters  Kuldeeps husband was one  is ready to forgive or forget.         
	He (Tytler) has just lost his ticket, not his life. Its common people like us who have been dying every day with the pain of justice denied, said Gurcharan Singh, who lived in Trilokpuri in 1984.         
	Hundreds of Sikhs gathered in front of the Karkardooma courts today to protest against the CBIs clean chit to Tytler. The court today deferred the hearing of the CBIs plea for permission to close the case against him. Fixing the arguments for April 28 and 29, the court asked the CBI for the CDs containing the evidence.         
	Outside, the most vocal of the protesters was a woman, who swung on the court gates and forced her way in, beating her chest and crying out for her slain husband as the eyes of men around her welled up.         
	A neighbour said the woman lived in Tilak Vihar, known as Widows Colony because the wives of men killed in Trilokpuri, Kalyanpuri, Mangolpuri, Sultanpuri and Nangloi had been allotted flats by the Delhi Development Authority there.         
	To the families of the dead, the withdrawal of tickets to Jagdish Tytler and Sajjan Kumar, accused of inciting the killer mobs, means nothing.         
	There were women from our colony, widows like Darshan Kaur and Anwar Kaur, who told the court that Congress leaders Sajjan Kumar and H.K.L. Bhagat led the mobs that killed their husbands. Who will get these women justice? asked a protester burning Tytlers effigy.        
	Kuldeep, who works as a school peon, said: Without my husband, look what has happened to my children. Her elder son drives an autorickshaw while the younger is jobless. Her daughter runs a beauty parlour from their home.        
	He will get a clean chit in the end.... I hope the Congress party loses badly, she added.         
	The Punjab unit of the Congress felt dropping Tytler and Sajjan was a wise decision and would go a long way in pacifying hurt Sikh sentiments.

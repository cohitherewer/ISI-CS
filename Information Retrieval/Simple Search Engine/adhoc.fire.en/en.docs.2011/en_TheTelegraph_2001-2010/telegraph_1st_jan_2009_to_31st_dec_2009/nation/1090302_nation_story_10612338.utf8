The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tough luck for Calcutta girl in Pole stakes
                                                                                                               Tough luck for Calcutta girl in Pole stakes
          AMIT ROY                                            Reena (top), Aparna: Close call            
	Hardangervidda (Norway), March 1: Aparna Ray, the 27-year-old from Calcutta, so impressed her trainers despite having no previous experience of skiing or indeed snow that choosing Reena Dharmshaktu ahead of her for the journey to the South Pole was expedition leader Felicity Astons most problematic choice.        
	With eight countries participating in the all-women Commonwealth expedition, Felicity said: With some the choice was easy after a week and the better candidate was obvious but India was my toughest decision.        
	In the end the extensive outdoor experience of Reena, a 38-year-old mountaineering instructor, clinched matters for her but it was a surprisingly close call. Aparna has certainly dispelled the notion that all Bengali women are softies. She will remain a reserve member of the team.        
	Aparna showed true determination and resolve skiing up and down slopes, said Felicity, who had to sit down for an overnight selection meeting with her team of trainers before choosing the girls who are to make an assault on the South Pole later this year and hopefully arrive at journeys end on New Years Day 2010.        
	To Reena then will fall the proud responsibility of planting the Indian flag at the geographic South Pole  incidentally, this is different from the magnetic South Pole.        
	She is an ardent supporter of the Indian Mountaineering Foundation which has provided 5,000 to send her and Aparna to the Norway training camp. But she will need sponsorship from Indian sources totalling 17,000 to undertake the expedition to the South Pole.                    The girls disappear into the bleak desolation of the Norwegian landscape. Pictures by Amit Roy      
	This afternoon, it was blowing a blizzard when the girls set off from Hardangervidda, where icicles two feet long adorn the outside of their huts, to the bleak emptiness of Kjeldebu where they will live in tents for three days, light a stove inside, drink melted snow and learn to survive. They are each pulling pulks, skis loaded with 50kg of chopped wood  this is because they have to take all their supplies across the Antarctic.        
	They were skiing through the valley of Bjoreidalen and will be rewarded with a view of the permanent ice pack that forms on top of Hardangerjokulen. Within minutes they had disappeared from view.         
	At least, when they journey to the South Pole, they will have modern lightweight rations and not have to follow the example of Roald Amundsen, the Norwegian who was the first man to reach the South Pole in 1912.        
	British trainer Jim Mayer, who has been briefing the girls on how to avoid hypothermia, frostbite, snow blindness, carbon dioxide poisoning from badly lit stoves and other life-threatening hazards, recalled: Amundsen used dogs to get to the South Pole  he would kill some of the dogs and eat them and also feed the meat to the other surviving dogs.        
	The Telegraph did not distinguish itself, alas, on a practiceski run but Mayers warnings on the need to wear proper kit and not get too hot or too cold have been taken to heart by the girls.        
	The normal body temperature is 37C, he said. If it drops to 35C, you start shivering and feel cold; at 34C, there are personality changes and people become introverted; at 33C, you stop feeling cold, the shivering stops and you become drowsy; at 32C, the limbs stiffen; at 31C, the drowsiness leads to unconsciousness; at 30C, the pupils become fixed and dilated; at 29C, the pulse becomes weak; at 24C, there is only one result  death.

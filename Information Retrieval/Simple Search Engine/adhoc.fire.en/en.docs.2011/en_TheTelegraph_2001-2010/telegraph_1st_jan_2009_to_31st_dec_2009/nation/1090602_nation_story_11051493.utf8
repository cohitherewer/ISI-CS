The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Omar calls for women death probe
                                                                                                               Omar calls for women death probe
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Srinagar, June 1: The Jammu and Kashmir chief minister today ordered a judicial probe into the mysterious deaths of two women amid allegations that they were raped and murdered by security forces.        
	Villagers in Shopian said the women  Neelofar, 25, and her 19-year-old sister-in-law Aaliya  had left for an orchard in a nearby village last Friday. Their bodies were found by a stream the next day.         
	Omar Abdullah said a retired high court judge, Justice Muzaffar Jan, would probe the case and submit the report in a month. Justice Jan would look into all the circumstances, he said.         
	A judicial inquiry has become inevitable because the situation is such that even if we come out with a report now it is not going to be accepted by the people. So, it was thought that a judicial probe... is the only option, he added.         
	If people are not satisfied with the autopsy conducted by the doctors, I am willing to exhume the bodies and get the post-mortem done... from any part of the country if the judicial inquiry feels there is a need, Omar said.         
	The first autopsy had shown no injury marks on the women.

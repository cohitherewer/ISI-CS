          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 8: Forget animals, even the activists protecting their rights are not safe at a university campus where the innocuous creatures are frequently taken for treatment.        
	A group of animal activists were detained for over six hours yesterday by Orissa University of Agriculture and Technology students who demanded that they withdrew their complaint against the display of animals on the ramp during the institutes annual day celebrations last month.        
	The students held us up for over six hours, forcing us to withdraw the case, said Sanjib Das, an activist of Peoples for Animal (PFA). Five PFA activists went to the varsity in connection with the treatment of two stray dogs suffering from chronic diseases when the incident took place. On our way back, we were intercepted by a group of students. They stopped our ambulance and forced us to withdraw the case, said Amulya, another activist. The innocent animals, too, had to stay without food and water for so many hours.        
	Although we tried to contact the police, they remained indifferent, Das alleged.        
	On November 7, students walked the ramp with cocks, hens, turkeys, ducks, cranes, snakes, rabbits, parrots, dogs, cats and calves in awkward positions amid high-watt music and lights scaring the animals and birds.

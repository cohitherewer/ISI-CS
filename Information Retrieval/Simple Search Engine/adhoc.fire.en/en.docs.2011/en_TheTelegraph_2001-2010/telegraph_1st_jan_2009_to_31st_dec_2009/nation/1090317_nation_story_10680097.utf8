The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | UGC   promises tighter rules
                                                                                                               UGC   promises tighter rules
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                     
	New Delhi, March 16: The UGC has promised to introduce anti-ragging regulations binding on all institutions that receive its funding by April, 22 months after a Supreme Court-appointed panel against ragging asked it to do so.         
	But the panel is not ready to accept the University Grants Commissions assurance at face value and is preparing to grill the commission and other higher education regulators on the delay in introducing regulations.         
	The UGC today issued a statement promising that it would finalise the regulations by the first week of April, admitting that the recent spate of ragging-related violence was a motivation.         
	But the promise is unlikely to save it from embarra- ssing questions from the apex court panel, and potentially from the Supreme Court itself, top government officials said.         
	The panel, headed by former CBI director R.K. Raghavan, plans to quiz the UGC and other higher education regulators over their failure to introduce the rules despite repeated reminders, mem-bers of the committee have indicated.         
	It appears that it takes the gruesome lynching of a student for the UGC to claim it will introduce regulations, said an angry member.         
	He was referring to the death of 19-year-old Aman Kachroo at a Himachal Pradesh medical college after physical abuse by a group of senior students.         
	The panel has asked all higher education regulators to appear at a meeting in the capital on March 25 and explain why they had failed to introduce the anti-ragging regulations.         
	The panel, it is learnt, is preparing to approach the Supreme Court at a hearing at the end of this month to seek action against the regulators which fail to provide satisfactory answers at the March 25 meeting.         
	The UGC regulates university education.         
	Other regulators in the Raghavan committees firing line include the All India Council of Technical Education, the Medical Council of India, the Dental Council of India, the Nursing Council of India and the Pharmacy Council of India.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, Oct. 8: A newly elected Bodh Gaya MLA, Sarwajeet Kumar, has demanded that the Mahabodhi Temple be de-listed from Unesco World Heritage Site list.         
	In a news release, the MLA alleged that vendors and stall-owners were being harassed and uprooted from Bodh Gaya pavements by authorities who were quoting Unesco guidelines for conservation of heritage structures and a master plan approved by the Bihar government as reasons for the eviction.         
	The Bodh Gaya master plan prepared by the Housing and Urban Development Corporation (Hudco) and notified by the government suggests the construction of a buffer zone within a radius of 500m on all sides of the temple.        
	Besides the zone, only 3.3-m structures are permitted within a radius of 1km from the temple.         
	Height of buildings within 2km of the shrine has been restricted to 11m.        
	The plan is yet to be executed as it is facing residents resistance.         
	As a result, projects connected with Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission has been stalled as well, as the missions projects are linked with the master plan.        
	Bodh Gaya is the only place apart from Patna that was included in the list of cities and towns to be developed under the mission.        
	MLA Kumar has demanded permanent settlement of vendors near the Tibetan refugee market and has threatened to launch an agitation if his demands are met.

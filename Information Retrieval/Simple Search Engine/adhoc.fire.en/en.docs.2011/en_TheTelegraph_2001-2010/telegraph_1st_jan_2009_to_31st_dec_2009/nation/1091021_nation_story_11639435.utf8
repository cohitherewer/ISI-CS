          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Jean Dreze                          
	New Delhi, Oct. 20: Aruna Roy and Jean Dreze, among the architects of the employment guarantee scheme, have written to rural development minister C.P. Joshi opposing a move to engage NGOs in large numbers for the job programme.        
	The two activists have said the plan goes against the very idea of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act. There is no way to ensure accountability in such an initiative, they have said in their letter.         
	Dreze and Roy are members of the Central Employment Guarantee Council, which oversees all matters related to the scheme.        
	According to sources, they have also objected to sub-contracting work to NGOs and financing them to run the Lok Sevak service, an NGO co-ordinator for the scheme in panchayats.         
	The ministry has issued a circular giving NGOs a key role in running the scheme. From creating awareness and training to monitoring and evaluation, they are to be entrusted with all-round responsibility for the programme.        
	The NGOs will be brought in through the Council for Advancement of Peoples Action and Rural Technology (Capart), a wing under the ministry. An amount of Rs 15 crore has been set aside for the NGOs in this financial year.        
	Dreze and Roy in the letter had earlier spoken against building Rajiv Gandhi Seva Kendras, assembly halls in panchayats for work related to the scheme, using NREGA funds saying it amounted to politicisation.        
	The two had also demanded that all projects should be within the list of permissible works under the scheme and must be carried out with transparency and safeguards. This followed a controversy over projects executed under the scheme on private land.        
	Dreze and Roy have demanded that the government honour its promise of guaranteeing a daily wage of at least Rs 100 in real terms money wage minus inflation.        
	They have voiced their reservations about a confidentiality clause in a plan to appoint ombudsmen for the scheme. Under this, information submitted to the ombudsman will not be disclosed.        
	Another clause that hasnt gone done well with them is the one that doesnt give the ombudsman powers to impose penalties. Also, they are not in favour of giving states powers to remove the ombudsman, as the plan has proposed, over fears it will make them weak.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Nov. 16: Rajnath Singh is likely to quit as BJP president before his term ends in December to make way for his successor, RSS nominee Nitin Gadkari.        
	With the Sangh having made up its mind on Gadkari, sources close to Rajnath said he had conveyed to RSS chief Mohanrao Bhagwat that he was not keen to continue as the chief for too long.        
	The sources said Rajnath did not wish to continue as a lame-duck chief when the Sangh was determined to put the BJP back on the rails as soon it could. However, the process may not be over before February as the organisational polls  which are expected to culminate in the election of a new party head  are running behind time in some of the states where polls were held recently. Under the BJPs constitution, 50 per cent of the states must complete the party elections to enable the formation of the electoral colleges whose members nominate a presidential candidate.         
	If the choice is unanimous, the candidate automatically stands elected. Sources said leaders in states where the party elections were over had been told to send the name of their preferred presidential candidate so that the exercise could be completed by mid-December.         
	They admitted the procedure had become a formality after the RSS zeroed in on Maharashtra leader Gadkari.        
	Another interpretation was that Rajnaths early exit was a pressure tactic to force L.K. Advani to step down as Opposition leader in the Lok Sabha, part of the RSSs script for the BJP.         
	The sources said Rajnathhad pitched for Sushma Swaraj as the next Opposition leader.        
	The Sangh is said to be shortlisting names for Gadkaris team.

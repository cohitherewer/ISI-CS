The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | SC on barbaric seniors
                                                                                                               SC on barbaric seniors
                            
	New Delhi, Sept. 7 (PTI): The Supreme Court today asked senior students not to behave in a barbaric manner and be like elder brothers to juniors, expressing concern over recent incidents of ragging.        
	The seniors should not behave in a barabaric manner. They should be like elder brothers to freshers. The freshers should not be scared, a bench of Justices Markandey Katju and A.K. Ganguly said.         
	It said all students were not of the same temperament and instead of subjecting them to ragging, the seniors should guide and help them without destroying their confidence.         
	Everybody is not same. Some are more sensitive and emotional, the bench said.         
	However, the apex court had some reservations on guidelines to streamline students union elections and curb ragging that were being adopted by Cambridge University and some other institutions. We cannot copy everything from England, it said.

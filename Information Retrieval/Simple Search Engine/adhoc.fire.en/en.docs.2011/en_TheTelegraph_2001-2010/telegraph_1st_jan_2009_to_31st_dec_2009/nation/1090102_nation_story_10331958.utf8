The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rush to clear 16 central varsities
                                                                                                               Rush to clear 16 central varsities
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 1: The Centre is clearing the decks for 16 new central universities in the 2009 session, a day after notifying the largest pay hike for five lakh university and college teachers.        
	Two months after a University Grants Commission (UGC) pay panel recommended an average salary hike of 75 per cent, the Centre last night notified the proposed raise to coincide with the New Year.        
	Barely hours later, the human resource development ministry was today buzzing with hectic preparations to try and introduce before the cabinet tomorrow a revised bill on the new universities.         
	Last night we met our promise to lakhs of teachers. Now, our task is cut out to ensure we meet our commitment to students, a senior government official said.        
	The 16 universities could add over 30,000 seats within five years to the countrys over-stretched centrally funded higher education system.         
	The universities are to come up in 16 states that dont have a central university at present. Most students enter higher education at the age of 18 or more, when they make up a crucial chunk of new voters.         
	An omnibus bill legalising the proposed universities was to be introduced in Parliaments last session in December.         
	But two states that had earlier proposed upgrading their universities to central universities withdrew their acceptance, forcing a rethink on the bill.         
	Goa University and Panjab University  which their respective states had proposed as candidates for conversion to central status had to be removed from the list.         
	The bill has now been altered to introduce plans for new centrally funded universities in Punjab and Goa in place of the withdrawn institutions. The altered bill was this evening sent to the cabinet secretariat as officials tried to fit a discussion on the bill into tomorrows cabinet agenda.         
	Once the cabinet clears the altered bill, it can either be enacted by Parliament when it next meets, or be implemented through a government ordinance.         
	Yesterdays notification on the hike grants PhDs entering the teaching profession better pay than candidates entering the Indian Administrative Services after clearing the civil services examinations.         
	The UGC pay panel, headed by former Jawaharlal Nehru University vice-chancellor G.K. Chadha, had recommended that students be allowed to evaluate teacher performance to introduce greater accountability.        
	But the ministry, as reported earlier by The Telegraph, deleted this proposal from the notification published in the Gazette of India. The final notification is also bereft of a proposal to create a new elite category of faculty.         
	These teachers, the Chadha committee had recommended, could be called Professors of Eminence.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 8: Stung by the Opposition criticism over the failure in implementation of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, chief minister Naveen Patnaik today asked district collectors to ensure utilisation of 100 per cent funds.         
	The instruction was issued to the collectors through a video-conference, conducted by the chief minister here today.         
	Naveen asked the collectors to speed up the pace of NREGS works since this was the working season, official sources said.         
	He advised the officials to prioritise construction of village ponds, diversion weirs, digging of farm and fishery ponds on the land of small and marginal farmers, renovation of canal, building of village roads and horticulture plantation.         
	Naveen also instructed the collectors to ensure wage payment to labourers through bank account at least once in every fortnight.         
	This issue had rocked the Assembly recently with the Opposition alleging that the government had failed to provide wage employment even as hundreds of crore were lying unspent. They had also alleged about widespread irregularities.        
	Naveen also asked the collectors to expedite paddy procurement and ensure that the farmers get remunerative price for their produce. The direction came in the wake of allegations about distress sale of paddy by the farmers, forcing them to desperation.        
	The chief minister instructed the collectors to deploy more employees in the paddy procurement work since it was a time-bond programme. He also advised them to involve the primary agricultural co-operative societies, self-help groups and pani panchayats (irrigation water user associations) in the paddy procurement programme.

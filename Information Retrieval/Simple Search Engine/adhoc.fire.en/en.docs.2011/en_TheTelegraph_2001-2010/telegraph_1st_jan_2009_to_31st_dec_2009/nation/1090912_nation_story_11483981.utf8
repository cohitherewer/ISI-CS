          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Sept. 11: Orissa High Court has decided to consider the legitimacy of a compensation claim, worth Rs 10 lakh, made by the widowed mother of Bhaskar Behera, giving fresh impetus to the 13-month-old controversy over the youths death, allegedly due to police brutality.         
	Bilasini Behera, 39, has demanded compensation for the death of her only child and family bread-earner. The mothers plea is that police caused her sons death on the night of June 14, 2007. When her son opened the door to a police party led by ASI Narendra Kumar Das, he was forcibly dragged outside and the personnel slapped, kicked and assaulted him till he bled from the mouth.        
	A two-judge bench of Acting Chief Justice I.M. Quddusi and Justice Sanju Panda yesterday issued a showcause to chief secretary, home secretary and Cuttack superintendent of police (rural). The respondents are to file responses before the case is taken up for hearing on October 19.         
	In February 2008, the high court had asked the State Human Rights Commission to inquire into the circumstances that led to the death of Bhaskar Behera of Rajnagar under Athagarh police station. The commission, while concluding the probe indicted the police and recommended the payment of Rs 1 lakh by the government as compensation.         
	Bhaskars body was brought dead at a local government hospital around 10pm on the night of June 14, 2007. The death had triggered a public outcry and a delay in the last rites by a day.         
	Commission chairman Justice R.K. Patra had recommended criminal proceedings against the personnel involved in the case.

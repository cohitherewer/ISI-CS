	Ranchi, Jan. 27: The Centre today asked the custodians of Presidents rule in Jharkhand to concentrate on maintaining law and order and not take hasty decisions that may have far-reaching policy as well as financial implications till such time a popular government was in place.         
	Coming a day after Republic Day when Governor Syed Sibtey Razi promised a cleaner and more efficient administration in the days to come, the instructions were issued by the Union home ministry and communicated in writing to all concerned, including the governors secretariat headed by principal secretary Sudhir Tripathi, chief secretary A.K. Basu and secretaries of all government departments.         
	Important policy decisions should be left to the popular government till it comes. Any legislation, policy amendments among others can wait till a full-fledged government takes over, said the letter.        
	If it is necessary and unavoidable, the same needs to be routed to (the) government of India through (the) Union home ministry. Moreover, there should be no unnecessary transfer of bureaucrats, the letter added, asking the government headed by Razi to focus on day-to-day activities as part of governance.        
	Two of the governors advisers visited Project Building today in a bid to familiarise themselves with the officials and got themselves offices to sit in.         
	Sunila Basant was allotted a ground floor room held by former revenue and land reforms minister Dulal Bhuiyan, while G. Krishnan shifted out of former deputy chief minister Stephen Marandis room to the second floor office (No. 218) held by former transport minister Anosh Ekka.         
	Another adviser, T.P. Sinha, is yet to take charge, but has been allotted an office on the second floor in the cabinet co-ordination epartment.        
	Todays missive from the Centre notwithstanding, the bureaucracy has been cool to Razis maiden reshuffle of officials and his comment of January 21 when he assumed charge of the state that good work would be rewarded, while laggard officials would be punished.        
	B.K. Tripathi, former principal secretary to Shibu Soren, was asked to head the disaster management department, while the former chief ministers blue-eyed boy, K.K. Khandelwal, was shunted to Palamau as divisional commissioner.        
	Earlier, Khandelwal held charge of the mines and road construction department and was at the helm of affairs when the Ghatkuri mines controversy broke with the Soren government planning to recommend six private players for a share of the West Singhbhum mines, otherwise reserved for PSUs.        
	Principal secretary to governor Sudhir Tripathi was given additional charge of information and public relations and civil aviation.         
	Industry secretary N.N. Sinha was bestowed with additional charge of road construction, while senior IAS officer S.K. Satpathy, was made in-charge of mines.        
	On January 21, chief secretary Basu told the media that the governor had taken strong objection to the pathetic record of revenue collections by the transport and excise departments (held by Independents Ekka and Kamlesh Kumar Singh, respectively).         
	The governor also issued a seven-day deadline to the chief secretary to identify cases of financial irregularities in departments wherein funds were allegedly diverted to personal accounts. Sources said one such case had been detected in the works department.

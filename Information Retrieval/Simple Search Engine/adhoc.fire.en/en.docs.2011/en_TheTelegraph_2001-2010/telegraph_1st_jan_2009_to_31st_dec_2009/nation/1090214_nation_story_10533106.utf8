The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nithari happy, for now
                                                                                                               Nithari happy, for now
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                          Rimpas parents Anil and Dolly Halder and brother Surojit outside the CBI court in Ghaziabad on Friday. (Prem Singh)                                   
	Nithari, Feb. 13: It was exactly 3pm when Surojit Haldar, 10, broke into an impromptu jig in front of the CBI special court in Ghaziabad. The boys face had lit up moments ago when he heard the killers of his 14-year-old sister Rimpa would be hanged.        
	The feeling was being shared several kilometres away in Nithari  a village on the outskirts of Noida  where Rimpa and the 18 other victims of Moninder Singh Pandher and his servant Surender Koli lived.        
	As news of the duos death sentence  handed in the first of the 19 cases, relating to Rimpas rape and murder  arrived, villagers hugged each other and kissed their children. It was as if many of them were smiling for the first time since that day 26 months ago when the drains behind businessman Pandhers Noida house threw up their missing childrens bones, skulls and torn clothing, stuffed in gunny bags.        
	So pervasive was the mood of happiness that even the three-and-a-half-year-old son of Pinky, a victim, began clapping. The boy was nine months old when his mother, then 20, disappeared.        
	I know I can never get bhai phonta from didi again, but I am happy that the men who killed her will be dead soon, Surojit said. His elders knew better.        
	The higher courts can acquit Pandher. We are happy but we are ready to fight on. This verdict gives us hope, said Pinkys mother Bandana Sarkar.        
	Rimpa was a beautiful girl. She was always smiling and never had a bad word for anyone. Now her soul will rest in peace, Deepali Mundka, Rimpas neighbour, said..        
	Rajesh Kumar, 19, whose sister Jyotis remains were found in Pandhers compound, felt the death sentence would warn everyone that you cannot get away with a crime like this. Our children are safe now. We can again trust humanity.        
	I had taken leave today to stay at home and pray that Rimpa gets justice. This isnt just Rimpas victory, its a victory for us all, said Satish Kumar, a man in his 40s.        
	Many, though, fear that Pandher would get away. I am happy but I wonder if the happiness will last. Pandher has got money and power and I just hope he doesnt get away in the high court, said Ratan Lal, 70.

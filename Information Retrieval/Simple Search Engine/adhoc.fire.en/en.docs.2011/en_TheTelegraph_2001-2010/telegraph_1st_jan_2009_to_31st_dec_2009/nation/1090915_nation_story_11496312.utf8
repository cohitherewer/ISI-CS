The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Obama game with football police
                                                                                                               Obama game with football police
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Chidambaram, Obama: Slogan power                                 
	New Delhi, Sept. 14: Fresh from America, the land of Barack Obamas stirring slogans, P. Chidambaram believes Yes, we can. But Indian police bosses will then have to learn to tell their political masters No, we cannot.        
	The Union home minister today told a conference of police officers: Can we accomplish all these (reforms in the security set-up) within a period of five years? I believe we can.         
	Then, he turned his attention to a problem plaguing the law-enforcement system in the country: frequent transfers of officers, usually intended at getting rid of those who refuse to toe the line drawn by the political bosses.        
	Chidambaram asked police chiefs to invoke the leaders in themselves and speak up against such transfers by state governments.         
	I ask you to search your hearts and answer the question, what is the average length of tenure of a district superintendent of police? What is the average length of tenure of a station house officer? Why do you remain silent when arbitrary postings and transfers are made by the state government? he asked.        
	Chidambaram, who returned from the US on Saturday, said such transfers had reduced officers to a football. It is a matter of deep regret that many police officers have been reduced to a football, to be kicked here and there, from one post to another, without regard to the damage done to the job as well as the officer.         
	The minister pointed out that the proposed Police Establishment Board, to decide transfers and postings, had not been constituted so far.        
	Is it not your duty as the head of the state police to raise your voice not only on behalf of your officers but also on behalf of the people that you are duty-bound to protect? the minister asked the gathering.        
	He offered a glimpse of the problem when he told reporters after the meeting that the average tenure of police officers was only four months in Uttar Pradesh  a state ruled by the Congresss rival Mayavati. The situation was better in CPM-ruled Bengal and Kerala, and BJP-ruled Gujarat, where police officers had longer stints of around two years, he said.        
	Chidambaram reminded state governments that while they could guard their turf  home affairs are a state subject  they must provide adequate funds for the police and not just residues.

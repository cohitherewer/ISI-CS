The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tech regulator faces cyber rival
                                                                                                               Tech regulator faces cyber rival
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 25: The graft-tainted All India Council for Technical Education is grappling with a fresh predicament  a crashed website curiously coinciding with the arrival of another AICTE on the Internet.         
	Under the CBI scanner for alleged corruption by its top officials, Indias apex technical education regulator is now examining a possible raid from the cyber world.         
	Hackers, government officials fear, may have disabled the regulators website, leading to a flow of visitors to another agency with the same acronym, starting last weekend.         
	The suspected agency, called the All India Computer and Technical Education-India, invites visitors to its website with the same statement  Welcome to AICTE  as the government regulator.         
	It claims to run a Rashtriya Saksharta Mission  the Hindi version of the National Literacy Mission that is the central governments apex adult literacy programme.         
	Now, it is fielding queries from across the country  and abroad  on the legitimacy of technical education institutions and courses in India  the responsibility of the original AICTE.         
	We are receiving several calls each day where the caller thinks we are the government council. Some callers tell us that the website of the council has collapsed, so we promise to help them with the information they need, said Vineet Kumar Saroha, who runs AICTE-India.         
	Saroha argued he was a victim of the AICTEs crashed website. I have to answer calls and help people instead of my normal work, he said.         
	Unless the government can establish that Sarohas organisation is responsible for the crash of the AICTE website, he is not guilty of any crime under the nations cyber laws, an expert clarified.         
	But Saroha admitted that his agency might have never received the kind of publicity it is benefiting from, had the AICTEs website not crashed.         
	A senior HRD ministry official said: It appears too much of a coincidence. The people behind the new website must be responsible.         
	A senior AICTE source said the council was not ruling out an inside hand behind the website crash.         
	We do not believe that AICTE-India deserves the credible website domain name it enjoys, the source argued, hinting that someone influential in the council or the government might have aided the agency in obtaining its web address aicte.ac.in.

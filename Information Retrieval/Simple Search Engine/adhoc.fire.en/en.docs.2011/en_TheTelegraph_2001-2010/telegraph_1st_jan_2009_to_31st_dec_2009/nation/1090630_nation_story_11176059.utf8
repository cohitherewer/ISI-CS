          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, June 29: Seventy per cent of Air Indias 31,000 employees will get their June salaries by July 3 after the threat of a strike forced the airline to drop a planned a 15-day delay in payment.        
	Todays decision covered lower-level staff.         
	Officials said a meeting would be held after July 3 to decide when to pay the other employees.        
	The carrier is struggling with a loss of Rs 4,300 crore in 2008-09.         
	The management has told us that we would get our salaries on July 3, said J.B. Kadian, the general secretary of the Air Corp Employees Union, which had threatened a strike if there was a delay in payment of salaries.         
	The announcement followed talks between the unions and Air India chief Arvind Jadhav.         
	A move to cut salaries and allowances has been dropped, along with a proposal asking top managers to forego a months pay.

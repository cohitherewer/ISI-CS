          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Nitish: Flaying Congress                                  
	Patna, Nov. 30: Nitish Kumar today said the Congress was responsible for the demolition of Babri mosque, adding that the Liberhan Commission should have indicted the Congress and its leaders for the damning act of sacrilege.        
	The Bihar chief ministers strong remarks echoed those of his ally, the BJPs words on the issue. The BJP, too, yesterday said that the Congress itself had replaced the Babri mosque with Ramjanmbhoomi.         
	We simply followed up on what the Congress had already done with the structure, the BJP said.        
	Prior to leaving for West Champaran district today, Nitish told reporters that the PV Narasimha Rao-led Congress government brought out a white paper in 1993 on the circumstances leading to the mosques demolition. Parliament debated the white paper and found the Congress government was also responsible for the demolition of the mosque during the no-confidence motion then, he said.        
	Nitish pointed out that the Congress had ignored the suggestion from the security agencies at that time to accord Union territory status to Ayodhya and take control over the disputed area from the Uttar Pradesh government with help from the army. But the Rao government failed to act.        
	The Liberhan Commission should gone into all these details, he said, adding: The Congress government then also failed to institute a timely probe into the mosques demolition.        
	Nitishs remarks are reportedly aimed at exposing the Congress in the eyes of the Muslims in the run-up to next years Assembly polls in Bihar.

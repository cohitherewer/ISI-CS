	Bhubaneswar, June 4: Armed CPI(Maoist) rebels torched four vehicles of Essar Steel at Chitrakonda in Malkangiri yesterday evening.        
	The vehicles included a construction vehicle, a truck and two jeeps. While the company is yet to lodge a complaint, police have started a probe taking suo mote cognisance.        
	Earlier this week, the rebels had blown up an underground pipeline with powerful explosives in Malkangiri. The pipeline carried ore from Chhattisgarh to Essars Vishakhapatnam plant. A group of engineers had reached the spot for damage control when the second incident occurred. Tribals and Maoists alike have been opposing the pipeline.        
	In a political development in the state, CPI(ML) today lambasted CPI and CPM for betraying the Left cause by joining hands with the anti-people and pro-corporate BJD during the recent polls.         
	Talking to reporters today, CPI-ML(liberation) general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya said the vote share of the smaller Left parties had plummeted during the polls due to CPI and CPM betrayal. Then, he went on to add, the two parties failed to establish themselves as a credible alternative to the Congress and the BJP.        
	CPI-ML(liberation) had contested from 17 Assembly seats and four Lok Sabha seats in Orissa despite its limited capacity and was able to establish itself as a credible Left alternative with 10 lakh votes, said Bhattacharya. He added that the party would have fared better had there been Left unity.

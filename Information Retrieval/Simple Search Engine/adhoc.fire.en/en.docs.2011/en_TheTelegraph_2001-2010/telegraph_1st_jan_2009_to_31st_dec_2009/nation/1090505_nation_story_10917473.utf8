          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, May 4: The Centre today asked several states to keep ready quarantine and isolation facilities in select government hospitals in preparation for any local outbreak of the new H1N1 swine flu.         
	Health ministry officials said India was still free of the flu virus, but passengers arriving at the countrys international airports continue to be screened and those with respiratory symptoms are tested.         
	A video conference called by the cabinet secretary today reviewed the preparedness in 17 states. The states have been asked to alert private hospitals to look out for passengers who may develop symptoms a few days after arriving.         
	While laboratory tests to confirm H1N1 are now done in Delhi and Pune, two other government laboratories in Calcutta and Dibrugarh are also ready to conduct tests.

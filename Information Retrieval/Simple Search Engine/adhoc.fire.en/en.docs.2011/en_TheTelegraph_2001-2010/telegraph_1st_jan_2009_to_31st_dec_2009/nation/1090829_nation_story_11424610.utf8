The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Converge plan for twin job schemes
                                                                                                               Converge plan for twin job schemes
          CITHARA PAUL      
	New Delhi, Aug. 28: The government is planning to converge the execution of its biggest village vote catcher with another key employment scheme recently restructured, keeping its focus on making poor rural households into effective self-help groups.        
	While the popular NREGA  a 100-day rural job guarantee scheme  played a big role in the UPAs victory, the National Rural Livelihoods Mission, the renamed version of the Swarnjayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana, is mainly aimed at promoting self-employment.        
	The Union rural development ministry has called all state rural development ministers for a meeting on September 9 for final consultations on the convergence, which, officials said, would help avoid overlapping.        
	All state secretaries are also expected to attend the meeting.        
	We thought about converging the two as there will be a lot of overlapping of these two in the future as phase 2 of the NREGA will have increased focus on self employment generation, an official said.        
	Sources in the Union ministry said the main reason behind the convergence plan was to transform below-poverty-line (BPL) households into self-help groups as part of the NRLM livelihood mission and then employ rural poor through these groups as part of the job guarantee scheme.        
	Officials said the plan would help maximise livelihood opportunities for the rural poor by dovetailing funds.                  
	Even in the first phase of the NREGA, self-help groups were used effectively in states like Andhra Pradesh and Kerala. We are planning to create more self-help groups as part of the livelihood mission to provide jobs to the rural poor, said an official.        
	According to the official, the convergence had been conceived to make the goal of poverty eradication by 2015 a reality.         
	Woven around the mechanism of self-help groups, the livelihood mission has been designed to break the financial, technical and market constraints that individual BPL households face to cross the threshold of poverty.        
	The main components of the scheme include training for managing the groups, technology inputs for micro-enterprises, strengthening credit and support for marketing and infrastructure.        
	An official quoted junior rural development minister Agatha Sangma, who had recently said it was time to teach the rural people how to fish rather than giving them free fish.         
	We are going to do exactly that. Rather than providing jobs, we will teach the rural people to create work, the official said.        
	It has also been decided that an impact evaluation study will be conducted at the national and state levels every year to assess how the efforts to increase self-employment or skill-based employment and eliminate poverty were progressing.

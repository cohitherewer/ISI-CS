	Bhubaneswar, March 12: A five-member special squad armed with anti-stress medicines, ice, glucose and sprays are ready to help out Nandan Kanan zoo animals beat the heat.        
	Considering the quick rise in mercury in the past weeks, summer arrangements that are usually followed from the third week of March, are now being taken ahead of schedule. The beat-the-heat squad consists of the zoo veterinarian, Nandan Kanan assistant director, a range officer, a sanctuary manager and a zoo hospital staff who will monitor the health of the animals during the peak stress hours  between 12pm-3pm.         
	The authorities, in a detailed contingent plan to cope with the temperature rise, have chalked out a plan to protect the animals and birds in the best manner possible.        
	Thermometers have been fixed in the feeding cubicles belonging to the lions and the white tigers and in the squirrel, monkey and chimpanzee and bird enclosures.        
	Seasonal fruits such as watermelons, sugarcanes and cucumbers are being fed to the bigger mammals such as elephants, bears, and primates. Besides, coolers have been installed in the enclosures of orang-utans, chimpanzees and monkeys.         
	And a strict vigil is being kept on the water supply. All plumbers and electricians have been directed to provide top priority to the water supply and see that everything is in top order, said director Ajit Pattnaik.        
	The otherwise open-air enclosures of cheetals, elephants, squirrels and monkeys have been thatched and the birds, too, have been provided with shade, as have the reptiles. Wallows are being maintained for the Sambar, the wild pig, the deer and the rhinos, said the director.         
	A portable lawn sprinkler is being used in most of the enclosures to regulate the temperature. The range officer has been asked to carry out an immediate repair of defunct coolers and Aquaguards at water points for the visitors, he added.

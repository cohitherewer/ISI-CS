	New Delhi, Sept. 14: The Centre today admitted for the first time that Naxalites were tying up with insurgents in the Northeast, making a case for synergising operations.         
	The CPI (Maoist) has been keenly seeking ideological resonance and tactical understanding with Northeast insurgents and have begun to lend support to their secessionist ideology and demands, home minister P. Chidambaram said.        
	He was speaking at an annual conference of the police top brass here.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | RAW scientist in bribe net 
                                                                                                               RAW scientist in bribe net 
          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 3: A RAW official was arrested last night for allegedly accepting a bribe of Rs 1 lakh, possibly the first such case involving a senior member of the spy agency.        
	The Central Bureau of Investigation caught A.S. Narayana Rao, scientific officer with the countrys external intelligence agency, taking the cash from an exporter at a Delhi hotel following a trap.         
	Raos arrest came days after K.C. Verma took over as the new chief of the Research and Analysis Wing with the promise of change.        
	Rao had allegedly promised the Chennai-based exporter of scientific equipment help in getting a trade clearance.         
	The official allegedly claimed he had good contacts in the directorate-general of foreign trade, which issues the licence.        
	RAW officials were stunned but confirmed the arrest and promised action. A bad egg is a bad egg and action will certainly be taken, said a senior official.         
	The officials could not recall an instance of any colleague, much less a scientist, being caught red-handed while taking bribe.        
	Rao is one of many scientists at RAW, which has experts from several fields, including economics and computer technology.        
	The arrested scientist had allegedly demanded Rs 8 lakh as bribe. The exporter promised to pay him Rs 1 lakh as first instalment and informed the CBI.        
	The trap was laid at a hotel in Karol Bagh, a central Delhi area teeming with tourists and shoppers.        
	The arrest is another blot on the image of RAW, criticised for intelligence failures after the Mumbai attacks last November.        
	The bribery blow comes weeks before the case of Major General V. K. Singh (retired), a former RAW official who has been charged with violation of the official secrets act, will be heard on February 18.         
	Singh is accused of divulging classified information in his book, Indias External Intelligence, Secrets of RAW.        
	Singh had also alleged corruption in the spy agency.        
	Raos bribery arrest is one of the many over the past few weeks involving top officials. An IPS officer was allegedly caught peddling seized drugs in Mumbai recently. The officer, Saji Mohan, was arrested from a Mumbai hotel with 12kg of heroin worth around Rs 12 crore.

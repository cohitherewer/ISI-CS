	 Guwahati, Dec. 13: Six members of a family, four of them children, were murdered in Assams Sonapur today and police suspect the killers took away heads of two boys in the house.

	Harakantas sister-in-law Tuleswari Doley, who lives in an adjacent house, 40km from Guwahati, knocked on Harakantas door when she saw the family was not up and about past 7am. When the knocks went unheeded, Tuleswari pushed the door and saw the bleeding bodies lying on the floor.

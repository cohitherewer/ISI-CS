      31 days to go*      *For first day of polls                              
	 Mumbai (PTI): He had questioned Sonia Gandhis foreign origins. Now Sharad Pawar is being tarred with the same brush.          
	The NCP boss, who broke away from the Congress 10 years ago saying he couldnt accept foreigner Sonia, has been accused of contesting from a place he doesnt belong to.          
	Rashtriya Samaj Partys Mahadev Jaankar, Pawars rival from the Madha Lok Sabha seat, cant tire of highlighting the fact that the NCP leader isnt a local man.          
	The NCP couldnt find a suitable candidate from Madha and had to convince Pawar to fight. Pawar is not a local man while I belong to this constituency, Jaankar said.          
	The Satara engineer seems sure his plank will pay off. I am contesting to win. People have lost trust in Pawar, Jaankar said.           
	 Lucknow (PTI): Eye on vote bank, with an aim to defeat vote-bank politics.          Minority outfits have jumped into the Uttar Pradesh fray, their gaze fixed mainly on 17 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats.           One of them is the Ulema Council, which has decided to contest from over a dozen seats, including Rae Bareli and Amethi, the pocket boroughs of Sonia Gandhi and Rahul.          
	The council has protested the alleged harassment of Muslim youths in the name of terror. The community has realised that (mainstream) parties have used them as a vote bank only, coordinator Amir Rashadi Madani said.          
	 Fatehpur (PTI): This isnt the tenant Shivsahai Nigam had bargained for when he let out his commercial outlet.          
	The property-owner was in for a surprise when he found that his space, meant for a shop, wasnt stacked with the usual wares but Samajwadi flags and posters.          
	The partys candidate from this Uttar Pradesh seat, Rakesh Sachan, had turned the place into an election office. An FIR had been lodged against him and two other leaders for alleged violation of the model code of conduct.          Vanshgopal Verma, one of the two others booked, took the space on rent and provided it to Sachan, Nigam complained to the poll panel on Sunday. Nigam claimed his permission wasnt taken before the space was turned into a campaign office.

  - Dussehra, Diwali amp; Holi more rowdy in state        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Nitish Kumar offers puja on the occasion of Chhath. (PTI)                                        
	Patna, Oct. 25: The four-day Chhath festival that concluded at river ghats today was free of criminal activities that otherwise mark any festive congregation in the state.        
	This festival, as senior police officers admitted, is unique in the sense that even criminals prefer to retire for the day despite the crowds at river banks and pond banks offering a perfect opportunity to rob, steal or loot.         
	Be it faith or fear of god, even hardcore criminals clean the streets and ghats to help devotees, rather than indulge in criminal activities, said Patna senior superintendent of police Vineet Vinayak.         
	During Chhath we are usually less anxious. But, the scene is different during Dussehra, Holi and Diwali when several cases of theft, assault and harassment are reported. This festival gives us a chance to concentrate more on the devotees and help them offer obeisance to the sun.         
	A popular blessing in India happens to be doodho nahao, puto phalo (may god give you prosperity and sons) during Chhath people pray to goddess Chhath to bless them with a girl.         
	Primarily, Chhath is about nature worship. Devotees offer their thanks to the sun and Chhath with milk and water for providing them with light, air, water and fire, which constitute the basic ingredients for the human beings existence, said Akhileshwar Tiwary, a Sanskrit scholar.         
	The festival is celebrated with more fervour at Dev and Jehabad that have sun temples. Incidentally, the temples are located in the Naxalite dens in Aurangabad and Jehanabad. But, Chhath congregations have seldom been targeted by the rebels.         
	Initially, Chchath festival was confined to Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh. With people of Bihar migrating to various parts of the country and with the media covering the event, the festival is now celebrated with fervour at Delhi, Mumbai and other cities.         
	It acquired political dimension, too, when MNS chief Raj Thackeray objected to Mumbaikers celebrating a festival that was their own.         
	Unruffled by Thackerays objections, Bihar and UP people in Mumbai celebrated their Chhath as usual this year, according to reports reaching here. The banks of Yamuna in New Delhi too witnessed celebrations with large congregations of devotees gathering there.         
	Mythology states that queen Draupadi first began the ritual by offering her gratitude to the sun for protecting the Pandavs during their exile and after being driven by Kauravs from their land,         
	Devotees dressed in colourful garments carry milk, water, coconut, sugarcane and banana and other offering to the sun before sunrise and after sunset.        
	Man drowns         
	A man and his son drowned in the Libri, a tributary of the Kosi, while bathing on the occasion of Chhath Puja at Rangpura village in Purnia. Deputy superintendent of police (town) S.S. Thakur said Sone Lal Swarnkar, 40, and his son, Ajit, 13, drowned and the bodies were fished out of the river.

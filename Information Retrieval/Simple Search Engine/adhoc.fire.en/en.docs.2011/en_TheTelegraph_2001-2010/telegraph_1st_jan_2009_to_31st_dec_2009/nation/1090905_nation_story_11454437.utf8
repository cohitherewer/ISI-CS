The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PMO wakes up to 100-day deadline
                                                                                                               PMO wakes up to 100-day deadline
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                           Singh                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 4: Goaded by pressure to adorn its cap with a few 100-day feathers of its own, the Prime Ministers Office is scrambling to kick-start critical, but stillborn, monitoring and transparency projects over the next week.         
	A shade embarrassed that the PMO itself had fallen behind the 100-day target set during President Pratibha Patils June 4 address to Parliament, officials are now working overtime to fast-track the Delivery Monitoring Unit (DMU) and the open data policy, billed as a radical transparency measure which will go much beyond the scope of the Right to Information Act.         
	Both initiatives have laboured under a drag these past months, though for different reasons.         
	The DMU was dogged by high-profile personnel issues, the open data policy is still the subject of bureaucratic wrangling, especially between the ministries of defence and home affairs which remain averse to, and alarmed at, the thought of too much transparency.         
	Sources have confirmed to The Telegraph that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had initially earmarked his former media adviser, Sanjaya Baru, as head of the DMU.         
	Baru prematurely terminated a teaching assignment in Singapore and returned home at the end of July, presumably to take up a government assignment.         
	It soon became evident, though, that the job hed informally been slotted for was the subject of a bitter tussle involving top PMO bureaucrats and senior members of the ruling Congress who actively lobbied against Baru. A logjam ensued and, in the words of one senior official, the eye was temporarily off the DMU.         
	Sources said that last fortnight Singh himself decided to cut through the drift on the DMU and designate his principal secretary, T.K.A. Nair, in charge.         
	He also took a 90-minute meeting on the DMU and directed nodal ministries involved in the implementation of new initiatives and flagship and iconic projects to start publicly reporting progress by September 15. Much of this will be done through the web home pages of respective ministries.         
	There are 18 programmes to go under what PMO sources call real time monitoring by the DMU. Among them are the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, National Rural Health Mission, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, Bharat Nirman, Mission on Female Literacy, Rajiv Awas Yojana, Innovation Universities, Strengthening of Public Accountability through Right to Information, Dedicated Railway Freight Corridor, Land Ports, Assam Gas Cracker Project, the Prime Ministers Reconstruction Plan for Jammu and Kashmir and Infrastructure Development in the North East. Singh laid particular stress during the meeting that what is put in the public domain should be real-time data, accessible as widely as possible. In that sense, he told officials, the DMU should itself function as an instrument of transparency.         
	The other major transparency effort, the open data policy, marks a quantum improvement on the RTI because it aims to institutionalise voluntary disclosure of information by the government. With RTI, you need to apply, wait and in many cases even pay for information you receive, said a top official, explaining the difference. Once the open data policy becomes operational, anyone will automatically be able to access information through the Net or other means like hard copy and CDs.         
	The PMO has been pushing the open data policy for several years now but was being resisted by the home and defence ministries which have traditionally been zealous about keeping things under wraps.        
	Although the PMO claims success in allaying their apprehensions, sources say there are still pockets of resistance the placement of a draft open data policy for cabinet approval has, consequently, been delayed.         
	But because the Prime Minister is keen about it, on the lines of the transparency regime unveiled by the Barack Obama administration, and because it was part of the Presidents June 4 speech, the effort to convince the reluctant bureaucracy that nothing they consider of strategic value or critical to national security will come under its purview is on.         
	There is tonnes and tonnes of information which is non-strategic that the government still keeps away from public access, the official said. There is no virtue in such secrecy, in fact there is virtue in making it available, free information is critical to our development requirements, especially now that so many non-government and civil society groups have become partners in pushing us ahead.         
	Some of the non-strategic areas in which government still withholds information are geology, mapping, health and education, water resources, and industrial profiling. There is a whole lot of human development index data too that we uselessly keep away from public access and waste, in the right hands, all of this and more could be hugely beneficial to society, an official said.         
	The exact contours and architecture of the open data policy remain unclear even to those who are involved with giving it shape. These things tend to slowly evolve in government, said the official. The critical thing is that once a decisive push has been given, they develop their own dynamic, the nuts and bolts begin to fit.         
	In the PMOs reckoning, theres a week to go yet for the 100-day deadline  the media got it all wrong, they insist, count on from June 4, the day of the Presidents address  but nobodys quite sure thats enough time for the open data policy draft to be in place.

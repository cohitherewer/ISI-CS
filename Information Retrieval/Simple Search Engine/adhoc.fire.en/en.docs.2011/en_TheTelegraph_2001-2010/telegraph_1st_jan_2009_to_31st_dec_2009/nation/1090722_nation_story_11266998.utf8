          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Morcha supporters in Sukna issue passes for vehicles going to Sikkim. Picture by Kundan Yolmo                                  
	Darjeeling, July 21: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha today exempted from an ongoing strike the highway linking Sikkim to the rest of the country, blinking after an announcement that central forces would be deployed.        
	But the Morcha, which had dared the administration to deploy 100 companies, sought to link the retreat to a Bengal government statement that the demand for Gorkhaland could be discussed at the level of officials.        
	NH31A is the arterial road connecting Sikkim with the rest of the country. The Supreme Court had yesterday sent notices to the Morcha, the CPM and the Bengal government, asking them to explain in two weeks why its earlier order to not allow blockades on the highway had not been complied with.        
	Responding with rarely seen alacrity, the state government today decided to deploy seven companies (around 700 personnel) of the CRPF in Darjeeling.        
	The Supreme Court had issued the notices on a petition filed by .P. Bhandari, a resident of Sikkim who had listed the troubles his state faced whenever parties like the Morcha called strikes in the hills.         
	The Morcha had allowed vehicles bearing Sikkim number plates to use the highway from July 18 to July 23.        
	We had requested the Centre to make paramilitary forces available in Darjeeling district. The Union government agreed to our plea and seven companies of the CRPF will be deployed in the hills. We cannot, however, reveal where the forces will be stationed, said Rahul Srivastava, the superintendent of police, Darjeeling.         
	Told in the morning about the deployment of the CRPF, Morcha general secretary Roshan Giri had said: Even if 100 companies are deployed, our movement will not be crushed.        
	With the Morcha exempting the highway, it is not clear whether the administration would go ahead with the deployment. Central forces are already in the field in Lalgarh.        
	The face-saver for the Morcha came when home secretary Ardhendu Sen sent a letter on the official-level tripartite talks scheduled in Delhi on August 11.         
	Sen said: The Morcha wanted to know whether Gorkhaland would figure in the talks in Delhi. I have sent them a letter, saying we are ready to discuss anything, including the demand to create a separate state, but only at the official level.         
	Government sources later said the letter did not signify any change of stand, pointing out that the Gorkhaland demand would not be discussed at the political level. We did not want to be seen as inflexible. There is no harm in discussing any issue with officials, a source said.        
	However, after a meeting of the Morcha central committee this evening, Giri said: This is a victory of sorts for us. The state government has agreed to discuss Gorkhaland for the first time. We have decided to allow all vehicles to ply on NH31A. Police vehicles can also now move in the hills.        
	Asked about the fate of the indefinite strike, Giri said the party would hold discussions and take a decision in a day or two.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cool summer diet for long life at Nandankanan
                                                                                                               Cool summer diet for long life at Nandankanan
          PRIYA ABRAHAM                                            
	Bhubaneswar, May 22: Wild animals at the Nandankanan zoo have higher longevity than most others in the country, according to a comparative analysis.         
	The authorities today credited the figures to excellent health care, husbandry practices and the environmental enrichment available at the zoo.        
	This year, the number of deaths has gone down to 44 from 60 last year (see chart).        
	Zoo director Ajit Patnaik said: The mortality in a zoo never follows a definite pattern because so many factors, including age factors, outbreak of epidemic and illness determine this.         
	The authorities credited the fall in deaths to good health care for the inmates.         
	The health care of the captive animals and birds of the zoo is actively carried out by three full-time veterinary surgeons. Nandankanan is the only zoo in the country with zoo vets.         
	Routine de-worming as well as the protocol for management of ecto and endo parasites is scrupulously followed. A strict protocol is also followed for vaccination of the animals in the park. Blowpipes are used for administration of the vaccines since December, 2006. This has lowered injury and trauma for the animals.        
	A variety of fodder species have been grown in a special fodder farm spread over 31 acres of the zoo, keeping in mind the nutritional requirements of the animals.         
	More than 1.5 metric tonnes of fodder is produced daily, allowing relief to the park authorities from dependence on the grass and other food supplied from outside. All the items are scrupulously screened and disinfected before being distributed to the captive animals and birds.        
	This apart, feeding cubicles, kraals, and enclosures are meticulously cleaned and the unwanted growth of ground vegetation is removed at regular intervals. The water from the wet moat is cleaned and replenished at regular intervals.        
	The sanitation standards of the entire park have been significantly improved by outsourcing the sanitation to a private organisation.        
	Elaborate summer care for the inmates by way of a shade, cool water, thatching of roof and spraying of water to avert heat stress has been achieved. Anti-depressants and special summer food, including fruits, have also featured in animals diets.         
	There has been no death due to heat stress this year, said the director.

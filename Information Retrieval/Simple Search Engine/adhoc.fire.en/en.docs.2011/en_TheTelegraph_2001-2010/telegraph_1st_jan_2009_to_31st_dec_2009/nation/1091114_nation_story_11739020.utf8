	New Delhi, Nov. 13: The Prime Minister invited L.K. Advani, Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley to lunch on November 7, a day ahead of the Dalai Lamas visit to Arunachal Pradesh, to try and evolve a political consensus over the Centres China policy.        
	The lunch was the first hosted by Singh for the BJP leaders with whom his relations had been patchy during his first tenure because of Advanis personal attacks.        
	Singh, who had met Advani at a function on November 6, told him he wished to discuss matters of importance with him, and the lunch was arranged.        
	In his briefing, sources said, Singh tried to correct the perceptions that China had expansionist designs on India, a theory mooted at several forums following sporadic incursions at the China-India border. The government has consistently maintained that the situation was under control and that the problem arose largely because of unsettled boundary disputes that were being negotiated.        
	Sources said Singh stressed that India wanted to have good relations with China on the 60th anniversary of the establishment of bilateral diplomatic ties. He said the economic growth in both countries could benefit them mutually.        
	Singh wanted to take the main Opposition party on board on the governments China policy before Parliament reconvened on November 19, the sources said. They added that the government was concerned at the BJPs reaction to the largely ramped up media reports that made it appear as though China was about to launch a major offensive against India.        
	BJP president Rajnath Singh has accused the Centre of treating the 1,310 incursions lightly (he did not source his data) and claimed that a Chinese think tank had advised Beijing to dismember India into 25 pieces.        
	If the Opposition demanded a discussion on China in Parliament, the government wanted the BJP on board.        
	The Prime Minister also briefed the BJP leaders on the Dalai Lamas Arunachal visit that was preceded by Chinas objections that the state was a disputed territory and the Tibetan leader was a dissident and a renegade.        
	Sources said the governments highest rungs were divided on giving the monk the go-ahead. At a cabinet committee on security (CCS) meeting, a minister and a top official advised against provoking China. They mentioned how US President Barack Obama had denied the monk an audience in October.         
	Another CCS member, however, argued that India could not behave like a bad host with a revered guest and that the Dalai Lama was travelling as a Buddhist leader and not as a political activist. He convinced most of the other members, including the Prime Minister.        
	The Congress projected its Arunachal election victory as a triumph of nationalism and sources said that any suggestion that the Dalai Lamas trip might be hazardous to Indias global interests may have betrayed the spirit of the mandate.

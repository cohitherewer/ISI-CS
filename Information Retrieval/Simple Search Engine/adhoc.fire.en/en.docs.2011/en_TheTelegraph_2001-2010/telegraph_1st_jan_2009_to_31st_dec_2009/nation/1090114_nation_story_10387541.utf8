          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       David Miliband and Pranab Mukherjee in New Delhi on Tuesday. Picture by Rajesh Kumar                          
	New Delhi, Jan. 13: Britain today asked Islamabad to crack down on the Lashkar-e-Toiba politically but discounted the possibility of the involvement of the Pakistani state in the Mumbai attack.         
	I have said publicly I dont believe the attacks were directed by the Pakistani state... what is also important is the response of the Pakistani government to the LeT (Lashkar), British foreign secretary David Miliband said here.        
	Pakistan has been insisting that non-state actors were responsible for the attack from November 26 to 29 last year.        
	Miliband made no bones about the Lashkars involvement, asserting the group was responsible for the carnage but suggested the outfit had to be countered politically.        
	They need to be taken on politically in a frontal and clear manner, Miliband said, when his attention was drawn to reports suggesting that the Jamaat-ud-Dawa, a front of the Lashkar, had regrouped.        
	Miliband, speaking with foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee by his side, said Britain expected Pakistan to fulfil its responsibility. Those who have been arrested must be brought to justice and, if found guilty, need to be punished, Miliband said, alluding to the Lashkar leaders picked up from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.        
	Miliband said the origin of the attack was beyond doubt. We are absolutely clear about the origin of the attack and the responsibility that exists in Pakistan to bring the perpetrators to justice. What is relevant is the approach the Pakistani state takes on the menace of the LeT.         
	Miliband, scheduled to travel to Islamabad this week, praised the maturity and wisdom of Indias response, suggesting New Delhi had done well to respond diplomatically, rather than militarily, to the attack.        
	Pranab said India had shared the Mumbai evidence with the UK and had been assured that more pressure would be put on Pakistan to bring the perpetrators to justice.        
	The dossier of evidence has already been provided to Pakistan, Pranab said, adding they should now act on it.        
	On Pakistans rejection of Indias demand for handover of suspected terrorists, Pranab pointed out that Pakistan is obliged to implement all international commitments and resolutions against terrorism. One of the commitments, he said, was under the Saarc convention on anti-terrorism. Pakistan is a member of Saarc.        
	Pak probe         
	Pakistan Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani has promised to share the results of the probe into the Mumbai attacks with India but mentioned that Delhi had only shared information with it, not evidence.         
	The information provided by New Delhi on January 5 has been sent to the interior ministry for inquiry and its result will be shared with India in due course of time, he said.

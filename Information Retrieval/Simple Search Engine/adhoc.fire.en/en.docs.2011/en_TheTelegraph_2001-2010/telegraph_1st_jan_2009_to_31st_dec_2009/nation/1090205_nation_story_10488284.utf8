The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Munda help for Gorkha row 
                                                                                                               Munda help for Gorkha row 
          SANTOSH K. KIRO                               
	Ranchi, Feb. 4: Former Ranchi University vice-chancellor Ram Dayal Munda has had various leaders approaching him on the Gorkhaland issue over the past few days.         
	Some favour a separate state while others are opposing the movement, but all of them are trying to rope in Munda to fight for their cause.         
	While Roshan Giri, the general secretary of Gorkha Janmukti Morcha  the political group agitating for Gorkhaland, was in Ranchi three days ago, members of the Himalayan Forest Village Organisation arrived today.         
	Adivasi Vikas Parishad  a group opposed to the cause of Gorkhaland  was here yesterday.         
	All the leaders called on Munda, seeking his guidance to their own cause  each directly opposed to the other. They also sought the support of All Jharkhand Students Union president Sudesh Mahto.         
	At present, there is a situation of tension between the Gorkhas and the tribals of Jharkhand origin residing in the hill areas of Bengal due to some misunderstanding. We have urged Munda to bridge the gap, Giri told The Telegraph.         
	After having listened to all the leaders, Munda, however, decided to go slow in the matter.         
	I want to listen to more of what each of them have to say on the issue, the tribal activist said.         
	Adivasi Vikas Parishad leader Birsa Tirkey, who also met Munda yesterday, did not throw much light on the point of discussion. Tirkey told The Telegraph that he had come to discuss general issues affecting tribals in North Bengal with Munda.         
	But Giri accused a small group of tribals of Jharkhand origin living there  represented by Adivasi Vikas Parishad  of spreading rumours and creating tension between the Gorkhas and tribals.         
	The tribals of Jharkhand have created an example by fighting for their rights. We want tribal leaders of Jharkhand to convince their brethren in North Bengal to follow their path, said Kishore Thappa, president of Himalayan Forest Village Organisation.        
	Thappa, along with his men Saran Rai and Shiva Sunwar, today met Munda on the issue.         
	The leaders agitating for a separate state said that members of Adivasi Vikas Parishad were misguiding their tribesmen by saying that the Gorkhas would chase them away if the demand of a separate state of Gorkhaland was met.         
	This rumour is baseless. We, Gorkhas, have lived happily with tribes of Jharkhand origin for the past 200 years, said Thappa.

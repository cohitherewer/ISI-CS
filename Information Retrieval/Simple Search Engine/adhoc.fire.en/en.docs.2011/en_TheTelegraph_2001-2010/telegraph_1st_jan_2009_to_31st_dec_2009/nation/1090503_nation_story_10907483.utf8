The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Varsity exams put off
                                                                                                               Varsity exams put off
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, May 2: The state government today put off the semester exams of Biju Patnaik University of Technology (BPUT) indefinitely.         
	Students have been on a stir  including a hunger strike  since Thursday demanding scrapping of the Not Fit for Technical Education (NFT) system.         
	The university discussed the issue with chancellor and Governor Murlidhar Chandrakant Bhandare today, and decided to postpone the exams till further orders from the state government.         
	Yesterday, a delegation of students met the chancellor justifying their demands. While some their demands have already been accepted, the students have been pressing for scrapping the NFT system saying it would spoil their careers.        
	Besides, they have also demanded the sack of the registrar.         
	Yesterday, angry students locked the university office at Gandamunda.         
	Withdrawal of the NFT system is a must. Otherwise, we will continue with our agitation, threatened Satish Sharma, the secretary of the BPUT students union.        
	Two students on hungerstrike fell sick yesterday and had to be admitted to a city hospital.        
	Students have been demanding the return of the supplementary examination system and removal of the semester grade point average rule brought into effect in October 20007. The university had abolished the year back system in October.        
	 The new rules have been framed so that an extremely poor student with a less semester grade point average will have to give up studying at the university.        
	According to the university, any student getting lower than 4.5 semester grade point average in three consecutive (1st, 2nd and 3rd) semesters is declared not fit for technical education and has to quit the institute in the second year.         
	A student can avoid such a move if he passes in two-three subjects out of 18 theory subjects (in three semesters) for which he would get 30 chances. But he should attend all internal tests, laboratories.        
	The union, however, believes that this quit university system will cripple students and put them in a no-mans-land.         
	There was no need of such a rule since the university too wasnt without any blemish, the union says.

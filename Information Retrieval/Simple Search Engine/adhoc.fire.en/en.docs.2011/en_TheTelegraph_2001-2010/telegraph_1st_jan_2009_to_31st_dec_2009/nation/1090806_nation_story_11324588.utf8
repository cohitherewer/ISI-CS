          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, Aug. 5: Not through the power of bullets alone, the state government is mooting a proposal to preach morality in the red zone to curb Maoist menace.        
	To help the government in its move, teachers working in the interior areas  where the rebels have their say  would be pressed into service. About 150 government teachers from the worst Maoist-hit districts of Dantewada and Bijapur are currently undergoing training to impart moral values, spirituality and humanity.        
	Though government teachers would attend the programme organised by the states education department, teachers from Maoist-hit Bijapur and Dantewada districts were selected for the first batch.         
	After the programme, teachers will work for creating awareness about moral values, spirituality and humanity that can help bring ideological change in the society, education department secretary Nandkumar said.

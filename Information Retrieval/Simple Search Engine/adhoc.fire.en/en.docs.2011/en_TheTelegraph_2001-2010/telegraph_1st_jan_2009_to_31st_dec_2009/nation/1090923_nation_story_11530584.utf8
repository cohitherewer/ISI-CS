The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | ... But Advani decides to bat on
                                                                                                               ... But Advani decides to bat on
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Advani                          
	New Delhi, Sept. 22: The RSS may nudge and Manohar Parrikar may wink, they cannot stop L.K. Advani from campaigning in the Maharashtra Assembly elections, being billed as the next big test after the Lok Sabha polls.        
	The leader of the Opposition, however, was reluctant to make predictions. Maharashtra is an important state. Our alliance (BJP-Shiv Sena) has functioned smoothly in the Opposition and in government, he said.        
	Advani declined comment on the rebellions in the BJP after tickets were given to relatives of leaders such as Gopinath Munde.        
	After the Assembly polls, Advani plans to address party workers across the country to boost their morale and convince them that the BJP was not as down and out as it was perceived to be.        
	I tell my foreign visitors the (general election) verdict may be disappointing for my party (but) from Indias point (of view), it demonstrates the maturity of its electorate, he told The Telegraph.        
	I have always regarded the national verdict in the Lok Sabha polls as essentially an aggregate of the state verdicts. But in 2009, there was a common trend throughout the country. The average voter, whether he was in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal or Uttar Pradesh, had made up his mind that none of the bit players of the third and fourth fronts should be allowed to come to power. So the regional parties suffered badly. The only parties scoring three digits were the Congress and the BJP, and I regard this as significant.        
	Advanis principal message to his workers will be that regardless of ups and downs, the BJP will remain the only stable alternative in Indian politics.        
	On the BJPs perennial dilemma of balancing ideology with governance, Advani was clear that a purely ideological party would find it hard to rule at the Centre in a pluralistic country like India in which the states have different levels of political development.

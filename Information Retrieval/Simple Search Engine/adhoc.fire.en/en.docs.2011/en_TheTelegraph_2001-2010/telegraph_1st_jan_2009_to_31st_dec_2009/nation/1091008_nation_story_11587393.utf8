The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bus strike ends on seventh day
                                                                                                               Bus strike ends on seventh day
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 7: The All Orissa Private Bus Owners Association today called off their state-wide strike this evening.         
	We decided to call off the strike keeping in mind the inconvenience caused to passengers in the state, especially during the festive season, said association spokesman Debasis Nayak. However, the strike will continue on NH- 5 and NH-5(A), he said. The association has demanded release of arrested leaders and withdrawal of cases against them.         
	Thousands of commuters had suffered as the state-wide private bus strike had entered its seventh day despite the enforcement of Essential Service Maintenance Act and arrests of bus owners. Absence of railway links to Kandhamal, Malkangiri, Nowrangpur, Boudh, Kendrapara, Nayagarh and Sonepur had compounded their plight.         
	According to police sources, as many as 34 striking bus owners were arrested from the state, and FIRs were lodged against more than 100.        
	Private operators began the strike to protest against the toll tax imposed by the National Highways Authority on buses playing on NH-5 and NH-5(A) with effect from October 1. The owners had demanded that the Centre revise the fee.        
	The state started a crackdown after enforcing the Essential Service Maintenance Act on Monday evening as owners remained adamant on their strike decision. According to the act, the government could empower district collectors to seize private buses and run these as public transport. If any owner created obstacle, they could be arrested.        
	Transport secretary P.K. Jena said dozens of private buses has been seized under the acts provisions, being run on key routes. Earlier, the transport secretary had appealed to the remaining operators to call off their strike in public interest.        
	The bus owners association had submitted a proposal to the state to bear Rs 4 crore of the total Rs 6-crore toll fee burden. The association had offered to pay rest, which the government refused. Its not proper for a government to bear a fee burden imposed by the Centre, said transport minister Sanjiv Sahoo.        
	The association today put forth an alternative proposal before the government. Association spokesman Debasis Nayak said, the association has urged the government to refer their demands to a technical committee, headed by the transport commissioner, and ask the Centre to defer a toll fee to be imposed on them.         
	If the state does not accept this, we will court arrest en masse within a day or two, Nayak added.        
	Meanwhile, several leaders of Orissa Private Bus Owners Association went underground to evade arrest.

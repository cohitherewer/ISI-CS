          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, April 8: Former MP Surajbhan Singh, also husband to LJPs Nawada nominee Veena Devi, was detained by Patna police today for interrogation in connection with his alleged involvement in a murder committed two days ago.         
	Surajbhan Singh, a former LJP MP from Ballia  the constituency no longer exists due to the delimitation process  already stands convicted for another murder committed in 1992. He was disqualified by a court from entering the poll fray.         
	Two days ago, Samaresh Singh, a supporter of an Independent candidate from Nawada, was murdered in Kochgaon village in the constituency, 160km from the state capital. The deceaseds relatives lodged an FIR in a Nawada police station blaming Surajbhand and his henchmen for the death.         
	We are interrogating him and the process may take another day, said a Nawada police officer, requesting anonymity. LJP president Ram Vilas Paswan has slammed the move and has blamed his rivals for foul play. Everybody knows that Singh has not been involved in any criminal activities in the past five years. His detention is politically motivated, Paswan has said talking to the media today.        
	In a setback to the LJP, Patna High Court today dismissed Surajbhans petition seeking a stay on his conviction in a murder case to enable him to contest the Lok Sabha polls.        
	The division bench comprising Justices Shivakirti Singh and D.D. Jha turned down the contention.

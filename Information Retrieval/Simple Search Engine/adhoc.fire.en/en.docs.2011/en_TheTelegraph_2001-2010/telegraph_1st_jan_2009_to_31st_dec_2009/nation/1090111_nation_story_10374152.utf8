The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Gilani slams Mumbai noise
                                                                                                               Gilani slams Mumbai noise
                              Gilani: Spitting fire                            
	Karachi/New Delhi, Jan. 10: Pakistans Prime Minister today accused the world of double standards for making so much noise on the Mumbai attack when dozens had fallen victim to terror in his country and civilians were being slaughtered in Gaza.        
	Yousaf Raza Gilani also questioned the international communitys silence on atrocities in Kashmir.        
	The comments, on the sidelines of an official event in Karachi, came on a day Indias foreign minister ruled out Israeli-type action against Pakistan and US ambassador to Delhi David C. Mulford said Washington shouldnt insert itself as a referee between the neighbours.        
	Gilani said the 2007 suicide bomb attack that claimed former Premier Benazir Bhutto had also killed many others and that many foreigners had died in the Marriott Hotel assault in Islamabad last year.        
	How much noise did the world make then? Why didnt they say anything? Where was the world then? The world should think in a neutral manner. There is no need for them to make so much noise on one incident, he said.        
	As far as the Mumbai incident is concerned  see how many innocent children and women have been killed in Palestine. That is no less than the Mumbai attacks. Why is the world silent on that? he added.         
	We have to see that the world does not have double standards.        
	On Kashmir, he said, atrocities were being committed against innocent people. Why is the world silent on that?        
	In Delhi, foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee said the two situations were not comparable, when asked if an Israeli-type offensive could be an option for the government against Pakistan.         
	I have not gone and occupied any (of) Pakistans land which Israel has done (in Palestine). So, how the situation can be comparable, he told a TV channel.        
	He said all options were still open and Delhi expected Islamabad to act on the evidence linking elements in Pakistan to the Mumbai attack.         
	Mulford said Kashmir was a very special problem which India and Pakistan needed to solve by themselves. I think the two sides should be encouraged but the United States should not insert itself as the manager or the referee of the process, Mulford, who has been given an extension, told a TV channel.        
	The comments came amid reports that the next US administration might appoint former diplomat Richard C. Holbrooke as special envoy for India and Pakistan.                    WRITTEN WITH PTI REPORTS

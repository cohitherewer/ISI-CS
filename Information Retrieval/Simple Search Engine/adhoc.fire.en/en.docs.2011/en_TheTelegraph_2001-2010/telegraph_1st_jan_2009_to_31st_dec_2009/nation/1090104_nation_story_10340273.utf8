The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PM call for research role models
                                                                                                               PM call for research role models
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Jan. 3: The Prime Minister today described how his government had bolstered funding and infrastructure for scientific research and said it was now up to scientists, teachers and the industry to do their bit.        
	While our government is doing its bit to ensure quantitative development, the leadership for qualitative development must come from you, Manmohan Singh told some 3,000 delegates while inaugurating the 96th Indian Science Congress at the North Eastern Hill University, Shillong.        
	The demand side stimulus must come from institutions of excellence and industry, he added as a Special Protection Group jawan stood on the dais holding a snub-nosed automatic weapon, his right index finger curled around the trigger.        
	Two days after blasts killed five people in Guwahati, barely 100km away, the campus crawled with security personnel. Gun-toting police and paramilitary stood on rooftops, behind the pine trees, and on top of hills.        
	Singh said universities must do more to foster a research environment. It is teachers and researchers who inspire new generations. We need a new generation of role models and leaders.        
	Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) chairman G. Madhavan Nair virtually took the cue, giving a detailed description of Indias planned human space flight by 2015. After his presentation, packed with diagrams of the spacecraft, many students said they had been inspired enough to consider taking up space science.        
	Singh said Indias private industry should invest more into research and increase the demand for science and technology graduates. He cited the examples of the public-funded space and nuclear programmes.        
	Look at the role played by public investment in nuclear energy, space and defence-related industry in creating a demand for science and technology graduates, he said. We need a new wave of such investment from the private sector so that our young people will be encouraged increasingly to seek a career in science.        
	Science and technology minister Kapil Sibal said science could be a double-edged sword  terrorists were using sophisticated technology but the same technology could be used in fighting those who misuse it.        
	Sibal urged scientists to help us address the main challenges we face as a nation and as a planet, such as climate change, security, pandemics and the shortage of food, water and other natural resources.        
	Chhattisgarh couple S.K. Vajpai and Kiran Vajpai gave the poster presentation  a paper on the medicinal seeds of palash (Butea monosperma) and vantulsi (Ocimum gratissium), widely used in Ayurveda.        
	The Vajpais, on their first visit to Shillong, said discussions on medicinal plants would help frame effective policies to tap the Northeasts bio-diversity.        
	Singh described Shillong as his second adopted home after Guwahati (his official home as a Rajya Sabha member from Assam). He gave away awards to 13 scientists, including former Isro chairman K. Kasturirangan.        
	The five-day annual conference of the Calcutta-based Indian Science Congress Association will have research presentations, lectures and panel discussions on topics ranging from space missions and climate change to new sources of energy and methods to improve science education. Former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam will address the conference.

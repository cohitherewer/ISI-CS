                                                                                                               Panel nod to food research
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, March 29: The PIL over administering pro-biotic food supplement to infants in two tribal-dominated districts under an American agencys research programme has entered a decisive stage with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) giving its nod.        
	The state government was embroiled in a controversy for allowing the curd-like pro-biotic food supplement to be fed to newborns in selected villages in Sundargarh and Khurda districts. Under the programme, infants of 283 villages in Sundargarh and 284 villages in Khurda were fed the pro-biotic food.        
	The controversy had sparked off following a PIL seeking a ban on it was admitted in Orissa High Court in July last year.         
	In a bid to resolve the controversy, the high court referred the PIL to ICMR without expressing opinion on the merit of the case in October.        
	An American company had engaged Global Network for Women and Childrens Health Research Association (WCHRA) to conduct research on newborn in Sundargarh and Khurda districts by giving pro-biotic, a liquid baby food.         
	ICMRs advisory committee took it up for hearing in February this year. The committee had since submitted a report in pursuance of the high courts order.         
	The report has endorsed the agencys claims that the bacteria carrying supplement helps in digestion of food and prevention of infection among infants.         
	The new research was expected to play a key role in checking neo-natal deaths in the state, sources said.        
	Committee for Legal Aid to Poor (CLAP), a Cuttack-based legal support advocacy outfit, filed the PIL under Article 24 (d) and (e) of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was ratified by India as a state party.         
	Our contention has been that feeding pro-biotic food supplement to infants for research purposes violates the Infant Milk Substitute and Infant Foods Supply Act, 2003, said Bikash Das, the executive president of CLAP.         
	Besides, the curd like pro-biotic food supplement undermines the confidence of lactating mother, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Idiot Danny says sorry
                                                                                                               Idiot Danny says sorry
          PRATIM D. GUPTA                          Longinus Fernandes, the Jai ho choreographer                                  
	Calcutta, Feb. 23: Till yesterday, Longinus Fernandes was just another choreographer trying to make it big in Bollywood. Now he is known as the man who made Danny Boyle call himself an idiot.         
	At Kodak Theatre on Sunday night, the Slumdog Millionaire director spent precious seconds of his best director Oscar acceptance speech talking about Longinus. Im an idiot for leaving the guy who choreographed the final number off the credits, Boyle said.        
	I am not only feeling honoured, I am feeling touched from within, a stunned Longinus told The Telegraph over the phone from Mumbai. I didnt expect it at all. Only God can do something like this. This guy (Boyle) is second to God!        
	Ironically, Jai ho wasnt Jai ho when Longinus had choreographed the final dance sequence. It is a fact that we had to shoot the dance to Aaj ki raat from Don! revealed the choreographer who started out as an assistant to Farah Khan in Border.         
	I was told that a new song would be pumped in later and it would be similar to Aaj ki raat. There were times when even Aaj ki raat was not playing and it was only on my counts that people would be dancing. I had to scream my lungs out because there were about 3,000 people on the set. It was really a menace. When I saw the dance with the Jai ho song, I was happy that it fell into place so well.         
	But nobody remembered to put his name in the closing credits, which was punctuated with the energetic Jai ho dancing. That was a mistake, a rare thing that happens in life, said Longinus.         
	I did not pay any heed to it initially. But when it came to India, I put my foot down. The production house said they were sorry and sad that something like that had happened. When Danny Boyle got to know, he was really upset and he conveyed a message to me through the production house: I will make it up some day with abundance. But abundance like how!        
	Longinuss secret behind the Jai ho steps: simplicity.         
	In his words: I told Danny that I am not a complicated person. He liked that about me and told me to be simple and realistic. Danny Sir is a man who works from the heart, a very principled and disciplined person. Also I learnt so much from his eye for detail everything from a pin to a pillar had to be taken care of.        
	So did Danny want a tribute to Bollywood in Jai hos jhatkas and matkas? I dont think the dance is a tribute to Bo-llywood it is a tribute to cinema, added the man who choreographed the popular Pappu cant dance saala track last year.         
	Despite being British, the way he showed Mumbai speaks a lot about Danny Boyle. He is basically an optimistic man and champions the cause of the underdog. That is what he has tried to portray in the entire movie. And the dance tries to show that celebration, that optimism.        
	And how does the choreographer plan to cash in on the new-found glory? It do- esnt make a difference to me but I will be happy when my children walk on the streets and they will feel proud that their father was involved with an Oscar-winning film. I will cherish that all my life, Longinus signed off.

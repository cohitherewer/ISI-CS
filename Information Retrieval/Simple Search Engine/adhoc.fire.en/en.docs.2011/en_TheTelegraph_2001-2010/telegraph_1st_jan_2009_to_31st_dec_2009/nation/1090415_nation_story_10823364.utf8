                                                                                                               Wife held in BPO murder 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bangalore, April 14: A young BPO executive who suffocated to death after robbers gagged him in his home last month was murdered by his wife with the help of hired killers because she loved another man, police claimed today.        
	Bangalore police have arrested Umesh Krishnans wife Honey Mary and Bipin Kumar Singh, 25, an ayurveda graduate from Jharkhand who allegedly committed the murder on the morning of March 2.        
	Police sources said they were looking for another hired killer, also from Jharkhand, and at least three other men involved in the case.        
	The murder came to light after Mary called her neighbours in east Bangalores Banaswadi locality to help her and Krishnan, 27, saying they had been attacked by robbers in their flat.        
	The intruders had bound Krishnans hands with adhesive tape and also taped his nose and mouth, making him suffocate to death. There were several loops of tape around Krishnans mouth and jaw, a policeman had said.        
	Mary had then told the police she had fainted, and had managed to drag herself to her neighbours house when she regained consciousness. We suspected her but were not clear about her role (in the murder), said deputy commissioner (east) B.K. Singh.        
	Investigators, aided by mobile phone records, later found out that Mary was in love with a Surat-based mechanical engineer she met in Coimbatore while doing a computer course in 2006. But in October 2008, Mary apparently had to agree to marry Krishnan, the son of a family friend.        
	The police said the engineer, whose name has been withheld as he has not been arrested yet, enlisted the help of a colleague who, in turn, contacted a relative in Jharkhand to hire a killer.        
	They paid Bipin and another person Rs 30,000 for the murder, DCP Singh said.        
	The two visited Krishnans house a day before the murder to enquire about an address. On March 2, Mary allegedly let them in. Police sources said they bound Krishnan with the tape as he slept. The alleged killers also took away some jewellery to make it look like a robbery.        
	The cops caught up with Bipin in Chennai last Saturday, tracking him as he moved across Jharkhand and Calcutta.

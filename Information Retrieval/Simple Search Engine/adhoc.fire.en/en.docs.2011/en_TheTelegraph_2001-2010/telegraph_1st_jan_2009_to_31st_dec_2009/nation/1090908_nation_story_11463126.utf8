          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Sept. 7: In a major reprieve, Patna High Court today stayed a lower courts summons issued to Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar in connection with the murder of a Congress activist during the 1991 Lok Sabha polls to the Barh seat.         
	Opposition RJD and LJP had demanded that the chief minister step down after the court of Barh chief judicial magistrate summoned Nitish on September 9 for being a party to the 18-year-old murder of one Sitaram Singh near a polling booth at Pandarak in Barh.         
	The chief minister rejected the Oppositions demand and his party, the JD(U), declared the summons as illegal because a prosecution had exonerated the chief minister long ago.        
	Justice Sima Ali Khan today ordered a stay on the summons in response to a writ petition filed by Yogendra Prasad Yadav, who also stands chargesheeted in the case and had prayed that the HC stay the lower courts order.         
	Even before this, the bench of Justice Ajay Kumar Tripathi had stayed proceedings in the case that came up at Barh court on April 24, 2009. Sima Ali Khan declared the CJMs summon as unwarranted and uncalled for as the bench of Tripathi had already stayed the proceedings.         
	After issuing the stay order, Khan referred the case to the bench of Tripathi, who will fix the next date of hearing. Much after the prosecution gave its clean chit to Nitish, a relative of the deceased, Ashok Kumar Singh, challenged the prosecutions exoneration in the CJM court.        
	JD(U) state party chief Lallan Singh and national spokesman Shivanand Tiwary suspected that Ashok had challenged the prosecutions exoneration with a malicious design at the behest of RJD boss Lalu Prasad and LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan.

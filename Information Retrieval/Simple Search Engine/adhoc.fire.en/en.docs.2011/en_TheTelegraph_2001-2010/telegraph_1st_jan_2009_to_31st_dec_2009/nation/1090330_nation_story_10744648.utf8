The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Open school boss faces Arjun saffron stick
                                                                                                               Open school boss faces Arjun saffron stick
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           Arjun: Fight to finish                                  
	New Delhi, March 29: Education minister Arjun Singh has trained his guns on the countrys open schooling boss for allegedly delaying schemes aimed at benefiting minorities, reviving a desaffronisation drive he launched at the start of his term in 2004.         
	Five years after he removed several key education administrators appointed under the NDA for alleged Hindutva views, the human resource development minister has resurrected the theme as he completes his tenure.         
	The HRD ministry has accused M.C. Pant, the chairman of the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS), of neglecting promised schemes to improve education and skills among Muslim children, top government officials said.         
	The neglect has resulted in delays in implementation of the schemes, leading to below-par outcome indicators, the ministry alleged at a review of the open schooling programmes on March 25, the HRD ministry sources said.         
	Pant, a veteran educationist, was appointed in early 2004 by Murli Manohar Joshi, the HRD minister in the NDA regime. His five-year term is ending and the ministry has ruled out granting him any extension. It has advertised for fresh applicants, setting an age bar that rules Pant out of contention.         
	It is unfortunate that this perception has gained ground (that the National Institute of Open Schooling under him may have neglected minorities) because the statistics show otherwise. I am confident I have done faithfully the work assigned to me, Pant said, rejecting the insinuations levelled at the review meeting.         
	Pant claimed that the enrolment of Muslim children in centres recognised by the National Institute of Open Schooling had risen by around 20 per cent since 2007, when the organisation started religion-based performance evaluation.         
	But ministry officials have raised several questions over the performance of the National Institute of Open Schooling. They have questioned why the open schools started religion-based performance evaluation only in 2007.         
	The single biggest charge against Pant, sources said, revolves around what HRD ministry officials claim was a massive delay in launching a central scheme aimed specifically at Muslim girls in Bihar.         
	The scheme, titled Hunar (meaning skill), was cleared by the Union cabinet last year and formally launched by the HRD ministry in mid-2008. But ministry officials allege that following the formal launch, the National Institute of Open Schooling delayed the release of funds to Muslim socio-religious organisations keen to participate in the scheme.         
	As a result, hardly any Muslim girl has benefited so far, a ministry official said.         
	The HRD minister, sources said, was keen to expand the scheme throughout India, but could not seek the expansion from the cabinet because he could not show results from Bihar, an Arjun aide said.         
	Pant, however, argued that the delay in disbursement of funds under Hunar was because of the massive floods that swept across large parts of Bihar last year following a breach in the Kosi.         
	The first phase of funding for the scheme has been completed. The second phase is also under way now. There has been no let up at the NIOS end, Pant said.         
	The HRD ministry, it is learnt, on one prior occasion, contemplated pressing the appointment committee of the cabinet, headed by the Prime Minister, to remove Pant. Absence of adequate proof to establish the allegations, however, saved Pant, sources said.         
	Allegations against Pant for his alleged Hindutva tilt first surfaced in 2005. A group of academics wrote to Arjun accusing Pant of victimisation and harassment of employees/scholars who do not subscribe to the views of the Sangh parivar in their letter.         
	A week later, the late former CPM general secretary, Harkishen Singh Surjeet, in an editorial in the partys newspaper, targeted Pant and the National Institute of Open Schooling, alleging that Arjun had not completed his detoxification drive.

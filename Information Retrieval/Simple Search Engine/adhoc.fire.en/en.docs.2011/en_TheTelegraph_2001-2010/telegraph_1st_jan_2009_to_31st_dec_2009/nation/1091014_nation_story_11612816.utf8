                                                                                                               Talks with separatists soon: PC
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                              
	Srinagar, Oct. 13: New Delhi is set to resume the stalled dialogue process with the separatists in Jammu and Kashmir with home minister P. Chidambaram today saying the process will be taken to its logical conclusion and a solution will come up soon.        
	We will have dialogue with every section of the people. We mean dialogue process will start and it will be carried to its logical conclusion, Chidambaram told a gathering of Congress workers at the PCC headquarters on Moulana Azad Road in the city centre.        
	New Delhi was reluctant to engage the separatists after the dialogue process broke down in 2006 when the Hurriyat Conference refused to join a roundtable conference.        
	The home ministers statement comes days ahead of the Prime Ministers visit on October 27 when he is expected to extend an olive branch to the separatists.

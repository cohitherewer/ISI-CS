The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Old rivals gear up for House war
                                                                                                               Old rivals gear up for House war
          NALIN VERMA                          Nitish Kumar                                  
	Patna, May 29: The Lok Sabha battle may be over, but rivals Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad are getting into the war mode yet again for the 2010 Assembly elections.        
	The state NDA, under the leadership of the chief minister, had a dream run in the just-concluded Lok Sabha polls by winning 32 of the 40 seats, hitting out at rivals: the RJD-LJP combination.         
	Aware of the fact that he would have to consolidate on his Lok Sabha battle gains to retain his hot seat, Nitish has announced his intention to resume his vikas yatra (development march) again.         
	Right after the polls were over, Nitish travelled to Bihars villages on a thanksgiving mission. Aware that his prime opponent  the RJD-LJP combination  is demoralised now, and that the Congress leaders are in a dilemma after committing to granting a special status to the state, Nitish has been reminding the people of how the special status had become the Bihar peoples demand now.        
	While thanking the people for rejecting the destructive forces trying to win the polls on the basis of caste politics, the shrewd leader that he is, Nitish Kumar has approved of Rs 815 crore for a project for Mahadalits in which he plans to grant homes and water free of cost to the group.         
	The community supported the JD(U) in the polls and Nitish perhaps wishes to strengthen his clout over the population in the run-up to the 2010 polls.         
	At the same time, he wishes to maintain a good rapport with the Centre to earn largess that could enable him to execute the states development. He was the lone chief minister to send flowers to each and every Union minister soon after they took oath at Rastrapati Bhavan.         
	On the other hand, Lalu Prasad has been trying to keep the fighter in him alive. He called an RJD meeting yesterday and identified three reasons for the RJD-LJP defeat.        
	According to him, internal bickering in the ranks, lack of co-ordination between RJD and LJP cadre at grassroots and the combinations failure to address the local issues were the chief reasons for his failure.         
	RJD chief constituted a three-member committee headed by party veteran Raghubansh Prasad Singh to identify the governments shortcomings. Lalu announced that he would make night halts in villages and talk to people, who once loved me. I have accepted the peoples verdict. But I will try to understand where I failed.         
	The RJD chief said that his party would organise a rally on June 10 along with the LJP. After that Ram Vilas Paswan and I will sit together to ensure better co-ordination.         
	For now, Lalu has refused to comment on the ministry formation and Congresss next move.         
	Be sure that we will rise again. We have been a poor mans party. We have been their voice. We have liberated them from the feudal shackles. They will embrace us soon, he said to the cadre.

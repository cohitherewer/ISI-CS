	New Delhi, Dec. 10: The Congress is worried that its apparent capitulation on Telangana may re-ignite dormant statehood demands elsewhere, but it also expects political gains including the possibility of ruling both Andhra and the new state.        
	The party today desperately tried to send out the message that Telangana cannot be linked to these other demands and be seen as a precedent.        
	The Congress is troubled by two possible messages that may have gone out.        
	One, that the party, much stronger after the 2009 poll victory, had caved in at the first real political crisis it faced; and two, that a relatively small-time leader like K. Chandrasekhar Rao, beaten soundly in the last election, could force the partys hands.        
	Some leaders conceded that the Congress would have liked to create Telangana on its own terms instead of yielding to Raos fast and the manageable street violence. Yet, Raos failing health had indeed created panic.        
	What if Rao had died? a leader said. All the parties had extended support to Telangana in Parliament yesterday, and a weak Rosaiah government could not have handled the growing unrest in Hyderabad.        
	Sources said the party had to delay the decision and announce it at midnight because of the Prime Ministers absence.                        Sonia Gandhi      
	They also revealed that chief minister K. Rosaiah had been asked to call the December 7 all-party meeting only after Sonia Gandhi had made up her mind to grant statehood. They said P. Chidambaram had communicated to Rao on Wednesday afternoon the decision to bring a statehood resolution in the Assembly.        
	Sonia had been convinced by pro-Telangana leaders that the best way to finish off Telugu Desam leader N. Chandrababu Naidu and contain the influence of Jaganmohan Reddy was to divide the state.        
	A Telangana state would have been unthinkable during YSRs tenure but his exit had given the high command an opportunity to exert its authority.        
	Sources said it was possible for the new state to be formed within a year and a half. If the statehood is implemented during the term of this Assembly  it has over four years left  the seats from Telangana would go over to the new state and the government would be formed according to the current break-up of parties in these seats. That will allow the Congress to form the government in both states.        
	The Congress has 51 of Telanganas 119 seats, and the support of the Telangana Rashtra Samitis 10 MLAs will give it majority. Sources said there was a tacit understanding with Rao, who might even merge his party with the Congress in the future.        
	The Desam, which has strong roots in Telangana, is likely to pay for having opposed statehood. In truncated Andhra, its stronghold will be the smaller Rayalaseema region whereas state politics will be dominated by the coastal areas, where the Congress rules.        
	Congress leaders, therefore, believe the decision will bring political benefits in the long run. Jaganmohan, whose base is Telangana, is expected to get weakened because of his fathers anti-statehood stand.        
	Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi struggled to answer suggestions of surrender and argued the Congress had only responded to the consensus that emerged after Raos fast.        
	Asked about the fractured polity in the state where nearly 100 MLAs have tendered their resignation, Singhvi said the consensus was among the parties  individual choices did not matter.        
	On the demands for Vidarbha, Gorkhaland, Bundelkhand and Harit Pradesh states, Singhvi said all statehood demands were not connected  but he could not explain how Telangana was different.        
	Confronted with such demands, the Congress has so far taken refuge in the promise for a second States Re-organisation Commission. It has lost that shield now.        
	Singhvi tried to dilute the impression that the Congress alone was responsible for the situation. This cannot be done without a two-level consensus; one in Parliament and the other in the state Assembly, he said.        
	Party leaders are now determined to crush dissidence. The 21 Lok Sabha and eight Rajya Sabha MPs who had gone to meet Sonia this evening to lodge a protest were bluntly told to accept the high commands decision. Sonia said the decision had been taken keeping in mind the welfare of both Telangana and Andhra.

	Mumbai, Nov. 14 (PTI): Filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt today said he was hurt by reports that security agencies had not yet given a clean chit to his son Rahul.        
	I am deeply hurt. Rahul is a true and responsible Indian who himself volunteered to share the information with the agencies. Rahuls heart is clear and he doesnt require any clean chit from anyone, Bhatt said.        
	He accused the security agencies of not keeping their word and leaking selective information to the media.

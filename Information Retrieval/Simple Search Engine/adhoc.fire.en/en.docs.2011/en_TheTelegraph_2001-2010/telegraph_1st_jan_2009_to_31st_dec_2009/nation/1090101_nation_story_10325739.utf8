The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Kasab access plea
                                                                                                               Kasab access plea
          NASIR JAFFRY                               
	Islamabad, Dec. 31: Former human rights minister Ansar Burney has sought access to Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, days after Pakistan said it got a letter from the captured gunman requesting legal help.        
	We demand fair trial for Kasab by an independent organisation and urge the Indian government to hand over evidences, if any, to our trust besides giving me complete access to him, Burney said.        
	Indian home ministry sources, however, said they have yet to receive a formal request from Burney.        
	The rights activist said Kasabs confession couldnt be valued legally unless the confessional statement is endorsed and corroborated by other independent evidences.        
	Kasabs appeal was of no importance as such letters had no credence, he said.        
	A top Pakistani government official also doubted the authenticity of the letter.

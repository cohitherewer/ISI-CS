	New Delhi, May 25: A.K. Antony today took over as defence minister for the second time, three years after he had first walked into the South Block office, but the real reason for celebration in the armed forces was elsewhere.        
	The army raised its first regiment of the indigenous main battle tank, the Arjun, 36 years after it was conceived.        
	Antonys second innings has begun with great cheer. The air forces first airborne early warning and control system (AWACS), the Phalcon, also landed in Jamnagar this morning after a flight from Israel, an import delayed by a year and a half.        
	Further strengthening of the security apparatus is a priority for my ministry, Antony said minutes after taking over. The security scenario around India is getting more and more challenging. Developments around us are a cause for concern to us. So eternal vigilance is a must for us, he said.         
	In his second term, Antony said, new hardware for the armed forces would be bought apace. Delayed deliveries mean the armed forces have to make do with outdated equipment.         
	To meet these challenges, India needs to push modernisation of armed forces. Modernisation does not mean only procuring of equipment. Along with that, training of the armed forces is also important, Antony added.         
	He said he would emphasise infrastructure development in the Northeast and in border regions. Coastal security is also a priority area.         
	Even as Antony was being greeted by the service chiefs in South Block, the Combat Vehicles Research and Development Establishment in Avadi, Tamil Nadu, handed over 16 Arjun tanks to the army. They had handed over 29 tanks earlier. With this, the army will raise the first regiment of 45 tanks. The regiment would be located in Rajasthan.        
	The army has ordered 124 tanks. Defence Research and Development Organisation sources detail the tests the Arjun has been put through  including a recent one audited by an internationally reputed tank manufacturer  but senior army officials still have reservations about the performance of the tank.         
	Even parliamentary committee reports have pointed to the deficiencies of the Arjun combat vehicle. Mechanised forces officers say the tank is too heavy, its dimensions are too big for transportation over long distances, and its performance on uneven terrain is suspect.         
	The army is yet to decide the operational role of the MBT Arjun. A comparative trial with T-90 tanks  imported or licence-produced from Russia  will be held in October-November this year.         
	The Phalcon AWACS that landed in Jamnagar this morning, and is scheduled to be formally inducted into the IAF in a ceremony in Delhi on Wednesday, is an Israeli-built system mounted on a Russian-built IL-76 transport aircraft. It was procured as a result of a $1.1-billion tripartite deal between India, Israel and Russia.         
	Three Mig-29 and three Jaguar fighter aircraft escorted the new acquisition to Jamnagar.

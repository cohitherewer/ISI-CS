                                                                                                               Sukh Ram convicted
                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 20 (PTI): Former Union communications minister Sukh Ram, from whose houses the CBI seized Rs 3.61 crore in cash 13 years ago, was today convicted of corruption and could face a maximum of seven years in jail.        
	The 82-year-old politician from Himachal Pradesh was found guilty by special CBI judge V.K. Maheshwari who is likely to announce the punishment next Tuesday.         
	The section of the Prevention of Corruption Act under which he has been convicted carries a maximum sentence of seven years and deals with criminal misconduct of a public servant.        
	Sukh Ram, who held the communications portfolio in P.V. Narasimha Raos cabinet, was not present in the court when the verdict was announced. The court had exempted him from personal appearance to facilitate his appearance in another case in the city.        
	In its 150-page judgment, the court differed with the CBIs computation of Sukh Rams disproportionate assets and reduced the amount from Rs 5.36 crore to Rs 4.25 crore.        
	His illegal assets included Rs 2.45 crore in cash recovered from his official residence here and Rs 1.16 crore from his house in Mandi in Himachal Pradesh. The wealth was amassed between 1991 and 1996, according to the prosecution.

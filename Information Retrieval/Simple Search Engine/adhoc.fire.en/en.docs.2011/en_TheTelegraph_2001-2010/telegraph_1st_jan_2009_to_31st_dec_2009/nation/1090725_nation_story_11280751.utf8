          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, July 24: Poor rainfall has reduced the area under paddy cultivation by 21 per cent and may depress Indias rice production this year, the government said today in its latest assessment of the impact of the 2009 monsoon on crops.         
	The weak monsoon has adversely affected sowing of crops and the area under paddy cultivation is 11.46 million hectares this year compared to last years 14.52 million hectares, agriculture minister Sharad Pawar told Parliament today.         
	Although overall monsoon performance has improved, key paddy cultivation regions including the north-west, Uttar Pradesh and Gangetic Bengal have rainfall deficits greater than 40 per cent, according to new data from the India Meteorological Department.         
	The shortfall in paddy cultivation varies across states  from 875,000 hectares in Uttar Pradesh to 280,000 hectares in Bengal.         
	Rice area and productivity may be adversely impacted, Pawar said.         
	He said contingency plans tailored for specific agro-climatic regions would be operationalised in areas that have experienced prolonged dry spells.         
	The plans involve replacing the main crop, such as rice, with a substitute crop such as millet, picking early maturing (short-duration) varieties of rice and promoting special sowing practices such as reducing space between plants.         
	Pawar said 100MW additional power would be released to farmers in Punjab and Haryana to help them irrigate their land to complete transplantation of paddy and protect crops they have already sown. Punjab and Haryana account for 15 per cent of Indias total rice production which was about 95 million tonnes last year, a senior agrometeorological scientist said.         
	Punjab and Haryana have irrigation... the main reduction in rice yields are likely to be seen in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, said Kamlesh Singh, a scientist with the National Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting, Noida.         
	Singh said computer-based weather forecasts indicate that rainfall was unlikely to improve in the north-west paddy regions until at least July 28. Punjab and Haryana will get some rain, but not enough, he told The Telegraph.         
	The productivity potential of any rice transplanted after July 20 is lower than the productivity potential of rice transplanted between July 15 to July 20, Singh said.         
	Farmers in some regions may still have the option of planting short-duration paddy. Typical paddy varieties are in the fields for 130 days to 140 days, but direct-planted short-duration rice varieties could grow in 100 to 110 days.         
	But the erratic monsoon has had little effect on the sowing of other kharif (summer) crops.         
	The area under cotton, maize, pulses and oilseed cultivation is near normal, Pawar said. The area under cotton has actually increased from 6.1 million hectares last year to 6.8 million hectares this year. The farm areas under soyabean, sugarcane and pulses are only slightly lower than last years.

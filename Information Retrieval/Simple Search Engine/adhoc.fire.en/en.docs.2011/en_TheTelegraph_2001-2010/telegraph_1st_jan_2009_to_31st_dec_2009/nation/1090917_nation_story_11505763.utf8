                                                                                                               Court glare on beacons
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Sept. 16: Use of beacons atop vehicles across the state has come under judicial scrutiny following allegations of rampant misuse.        
	Misuse of red lights seems to have become the order of the day in the state, especially in Cuttack and Bhubaneswar. While vehicles use beacon illegally and persons flaunt red light-fitted cars despite not being on the entitled list, the authorities have not been able to curb it, it was alleged in a PIL.        
	Police officers posted in non-police departments like government press, road transport corporation, sports council, Gridco, officials of the board of revenue, local bodies, tribunal judges, district judges, chairman of Zilla Parishad and officers of several departments other than police are allegedly using beacons without any qualms.        
	Nishikant Mishra of Utkal Vidyarthi Abhijan, a city NGO, had filed the petition.                    
	The PIL came up for hearing before the division bench of acting Chief Justice I.M. Quddusi and Justice Sanju Panda on Tuesday.        
	Counsels for the petitioner D.K. Mohapatra and S.N. Panda told the court that guidelines for use of red light by VIPs in their vehicles were issued by the state government through the Orissa Motor Vehicles Rules, 1993.        
	The state government had subsequently issued directions to the transport department to remove beacons from the vehicles that are not entitled to use it. But the rampant misuse has gone unchecked, the counsels said, expressing concern that the laxity could become veritable tool for getaway cars of criminals.        
	Justice Quddusi issued notices to the transport department secretary, commissioner of State Transport Authority and the regional transport officers of Cuttack and Bhubaneswar.        
	The court further fixed a months deadline for the respondents to file their responses.        
	The Rule 99 of the Orissa Motor Vehicles Rules, 1993, specified: A flashing red light with bulb of not more than 7Watts may be fitted on the rooftop and the vehicle used by the dignitaries who are authorised to fly or display the national flag, provided that such lights shall be put to used only when the police patrolling or fire service vehicles are on actual duty.

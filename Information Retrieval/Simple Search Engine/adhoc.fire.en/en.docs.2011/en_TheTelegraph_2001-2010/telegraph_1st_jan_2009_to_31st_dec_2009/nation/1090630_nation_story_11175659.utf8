The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mamata pushes Delhi
                                                                                                               Mamata pushes Delhi
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, June 29: Mamata Banerjee today said the Lalgarh security operation should be suspended immediately and the central forces should be told to comb all of West Midnapore district to unearth illegal arms the CPM had stockpiled.        
	I want the suspension of operations in Lalgarh by the combined forces. Instead of helping the CPM by conducting this operation in Lalgarh, the Centre should use its forces to recover illegal arms that the CPM has stockpiled over months in other parts of West Midnapore, she told a news conference.        
	A lot of illegal arms are stashed away in places like Keshpur, Goaltore and Salboni, Mamata claimed.        
	The Centre should stop providing help to the CPM which is out to recapture Lalgarh on the lines of the Nandigram recapture in November 2007, she said.        
	The Trinamul Congress chief, now the railway minister, had earlier resented the Centres decision to send forces to Lalgarh on the bas is of information provided by the Bengal government and without taking her into confidence.         
	Back in Calcutta for a day, she said: Something has to be worked out to put an end to the CPMs game plan of taking the Centre for a ride.        
	Mamata said she had submitted a report to finance minister Pranab Mukherjee on how the CPM has unleashed state-sponsored terrorism on the pretext of a security operation in Lalgarh.         
	Reacting to the charge, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said: Prohibitory orders are not in force in Goaltore. So, members of any political party can freely move around there.

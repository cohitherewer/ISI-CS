          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 20: Four non-government entities have jointly petitioned the Supreme Court to restart vaccine production at three public sector units whose licences had been revoked by the health ministry last year.        
	The petitioners have accused the health ministry of delivering a deathblow to Indias century-old legacy of self-reliance in vaccine production and jeopardising the national immunisation programme by stopping vaccine flow from the three units.        
	The health ministry had in January 2008 revoked the vaccine production licences of the Central Research Institute, Kasauli, the Pasteur Institute of India, Coonoor, and the BCG Vaccine Laboratory, Chennai, on the grounds that they did not meet standards prescribed by the World Health Organization.        
	The petitioners said the closure was ordered at a time production in the three units was peaking and when there had been no complaints about the quality of vaccines they had produced.        
	Vaccines from private-sector companies will be 2 to 20 times more expensive than those made by the public sector, it said. Several states, including Bengal, Orissa, Tripura and Kerala, had faced shortages of vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis in 2008.

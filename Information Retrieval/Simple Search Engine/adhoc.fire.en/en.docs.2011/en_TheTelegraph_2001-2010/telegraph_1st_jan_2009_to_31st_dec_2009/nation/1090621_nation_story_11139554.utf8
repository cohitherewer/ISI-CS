          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Ahmedabad, June 20: The National Institute of Design (NID) has barred a second- year student from entering the hostel for six months for allegedly passing lewd comments at a girl on the institutions Gandhinagar campus.        
	Ashish Kumar was handed the suspension order yesterday following a written complaint from the girl who joined the institute last month.         
	The incident coincides with the launch of a nationwide anti-ragging helpline today.        
	The NID girl, a first-year student of strategic design management, lodged the complaint with Vinay Kumar, the dean of the post-graduate hostel. The anti-ragging committee of the institute took cognisance of the complaint and ordered suspension of the boy, in keeping with its policy of zero tolerance towards mischief on campus.        
	No official comment was forthcoming but sources said Ashish, a second-year student of toy and game design, had made lewd comments at the fresher who was walking past him. Ashish could not be reached for comment.        
	The anti-ragging committee called the two students and recorded their statements. Akhil Sahay, the NID Gandhinagar campus in-charge, said: The committees findings were that the nature of the complaints does not exactly fall under the purview of ragging. But action has been taken against the second-year student and he has been barred from the PG campus hostel for the next six months.         
	Sources said the student had reportedly apologised to the girl after the incident, but she refused to withdraw her complaint.         
	She demanded that he apologise publicly, which he did not.        
	Last year, five students of the institute underwent disciplinary action after they were caught ragging on the campus. While two of them were expelled from the institute, the other three were suspended from the hostel.

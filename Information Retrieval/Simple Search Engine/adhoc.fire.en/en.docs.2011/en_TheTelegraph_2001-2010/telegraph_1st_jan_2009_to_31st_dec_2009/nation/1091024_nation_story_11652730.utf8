The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hooda holler, Chavan chary 
                                                                                                               Hooda holler, Chavan chary 
          SANJAY K. JHA                                              Hooda and (below) Chavan      
	New Delhi, Oct. 23: The Congress today bolstered its prospects of forming the government in Haryana by parading all seven Independent MLAs before governor Jagannath Pahadia but left the decision on the chief ministers post to Sonia Gandhi.        
	In Maharashtra too, suspense continued over the choice of chief minister, with at least three serious contenders still in the fray.        
	Although the dominant view in the party is that incumbents Bhupinder Singh Hooda and Ashok Chavan will receive Sonias nod, most leaders admit the going would not be easy for either of them.        
	While Hoodas supporters vociferously demanded his continuation at this evenings Congress legislature party meeting in Chandigarh, Chavans rivals are sparing no effort in Mumbai to scupper his chances.        
	Hooda has buttressed his chances by promptly winning over the Independents, but Chavan has left it to the high commands goodwill since he cannot match his rivals political prowess, sources said.        
	Former chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh flew to Delhi today to press his case before Sonia. He then promptly returned to Mumbai, where Narayan Rane is busy rustling up MLAs support, ahead of tomorrows legislature party meeting.        
	Deshmukh told reporters after meeting Sonia that he was not in the race, but sources said he had told the party president that anti-Chavan sentiments were running high among the MLAs.        
	Party leaders confirmed that Deshmukh had the support of over 50 of the partys 82 MLAs and had stature and experience too. The big question, though, was whether the high command would be willing to reverse its post-26/11 decision to replace him with Chavan.        
	Senior leaders A.K. Antony, Digvijay Singh and K. Rehman Khan will attend tomorrows legislature party meeting in Mumbai. No decision is expected there, however, because building a consensus on Chavan would be difficult. The decision, therefore, is bound to be left to Sonia.        
	Sources said Deshmukh would transfer his support to Rane if his own chances disappeared.        
	In Haryana, Sonia is faced with no such dilemmas and any decision to change the chief minister is solely the high commands prerogative. She, however, has to assess the possible effects of removing Hooda since most MLAs, especially the Jats, support him.        
	The Haryana MLAs may not appreciate a decision to make Kumari Selja the chief minister for two reasons. One, she is hardly active in state politics and two, she is a Dalit. Scheduled Caste politicians and MPs, however, have launched their own campaign for a Dalit chief minister in at least one of the two states.        
	The high command also fears that Selja may not have the political experience or acumen to handle the volatile situation.        
	The Bhajan Lal factor, therefore, appears the only major hurdle for Hooda. Although Bhajans son Kuldeep Bishnoi has said his party, the Haryana Janhit Congress, would be part of the government, his supporters insist he had meant any government and not necessarily a Congress-led one. Bhajan, obviously, has kept his options open.        
	Hooda has said no pre-condition will be accepted for support from anyone. But some Congress leaders, keen to bring Bhajan back into the party, say this is the best opportunity. The situation in Haryana may clear tomorrow.

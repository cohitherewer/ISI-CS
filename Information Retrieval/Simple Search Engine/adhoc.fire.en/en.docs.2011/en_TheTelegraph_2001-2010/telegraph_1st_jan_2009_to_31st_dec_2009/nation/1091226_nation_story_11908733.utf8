	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 25: Much to the relief of the administration and Christians, the midnight mass and Christmas celebrations were held peacefully in communally sensitive Kandhamal and other parts of Orissa.        
	We had a very peaceful Christmas at all places in Kandhamal and other districts this year, said Cuttack-Bhubaneswar diocese archbishop Raphael Cheenath.        
	No incident of communal tension or violence was reported till now, said inspector-general of police (law and order) Arun Kumar Sarangi. Adequate armed forces have been deployed at all sensitive places, he said, adding that 30 platoons of armed police and 15 platoons of special police officers had been deployed in Kandhamal district alone.        
	Christians in communally scarred Kandhamal could not celebrate Christmas in 2007 because of communal violence on December 24 night. Though Christmas passed off peacefully last year amidst tight security, it was a low-key affair. But this year, Christmas was celebrated with usual pomp and fanfare, said Father Mathews of Catholic Church in Kandhamal.        
	We celebrated Christmas to our hearts content as we had no fear of riots this year, said Dusashan Singh, a faithful. Regina Mantri, another member of the Christian community, said: We prayed to God wishing that communal incidents did not recur in future.        
	Kandhamal superintendent of police S. Praveen Kumar told The Telegraph that Christmas celebrations across the district were absolutely peaceful. Members of other communities also participated in the celebrations, he said.

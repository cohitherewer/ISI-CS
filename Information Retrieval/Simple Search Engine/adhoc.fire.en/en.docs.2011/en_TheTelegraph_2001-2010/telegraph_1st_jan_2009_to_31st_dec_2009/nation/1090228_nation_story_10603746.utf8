The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Saris for child carers
                                                                                                               Saris for child carers
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 27: Over 1.8 million anganwadi workers across the country may soon drape themselves in saris designed by Indias premier fashion technology institution as they tend to children and pregnant women.         
	Twenty-five years after launching the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS), the worlds largest child care programme, India is introducing a uniform for the anganwadi workers who implement the scheme.         
	The National Institute of Fashion Technology has designed the saris in six colours for Renuka Chowdhurys women and child development ministry.         
	The saris will be unveiled tomorrow at a national convention of anganwadi workers organised by the ministry in the capital, government sources said.         
	But the saris are unlikely to be distributed across the country before the Lok Sabha elections  sari distribution, officials fear, could attract charges of allurement from the Election Commission.         
	The idea behind giving anganwadi workers a uniform is to give them a distinct identity that also enhances their dignity, a senior ministry official said. The workers tend to over 33 million children under 6 and about six million pregnant and lactating women at seven lakh anganwadis across the country.         
	Till last year, an anganwadi worker earned just Rs 1,000 a month and an anganwadi helper took home Rs 500.         
	In the 2008-09 budget, then finance minister P. Chidambaram increased the salary of anganwadi workers to Rs 1,500 a month and to Rs 750 for helpers.         
	The seed for the uniform idea was sown last year following a request from some anganwadi workers unions, sources said.         
	However, the uniform may not be mandatory, sources hinted, in deference to the sensitivities of those uncomfortable wearing a sari.         
	But we will encourage all anganwadi workers to wear the saris as we believe it is crucial for a workforce to have an identity. The saris are extremely graceful and we are confident most women would love them, a source said.         
	Later, the uniform may be expanded from the sari to other local dresses, too, the source added.         
	The plan for the uniform will need clearance from the Union cabinet before it can take off, but the sources said the Planning Commission had approved the move in principle. The Centre will provide funds for the uniform under the ICDS allocation but the actual purchase of the saris will be undertaken by state governments.         
	Each state, the sources said, would be allowed to choose the vendor for the saris  either from the public sector or from the private sector.

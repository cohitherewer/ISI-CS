	New Delhi, July 31: Energy efficiency labels would become mandatory for all refrigerators, air conditioners, fluorescent lamps (tubelights) and electric transformers sold across India from January 7, 2010, environment and forests minister Jairam Ramesh said today.         
	By June 2010, the energy efficiency ratings programme, implemented by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency, will also become mandatory for all colour television sets sold in India, Ramesh said, outlining a list of recent climate change initiatives taken by India.         
	All electric motors and LPG stoves manufactured and sold in India will also have to carry the efficiency label  a five-star rating system indicating the level of energy efficiency of the product or the appliance  from June 2010.         
	The rating is currently voluntary. Some manufacturers of air conditioners and other appliances are getting products rated for efficiency, but many products still do not come with the label.         
	Ramesh said he had written to chief ministers to take the Delhi government, which has decided to implement an energy conservation code in all new buildings in the capital, as an example.         
	The code is a set of possible practices aimed at minimising energy consumption by a building.

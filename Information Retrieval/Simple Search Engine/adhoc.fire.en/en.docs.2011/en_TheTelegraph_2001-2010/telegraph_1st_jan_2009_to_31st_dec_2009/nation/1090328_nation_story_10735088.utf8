          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Patna, March 27: RJD chief Lalu Prasad today said that his party and Ram Vilas Paswan-led LJP had allied with the Samajwadi Party president, Mulayam Singh Yadav, to strengthen the secular bloc and defeat NDA.        
	Lalu clarified that they had not formed a front against the UPA.        
	I have no hidden agenda and want to make it clear that I am with the UPA and will be in it in the coming days, he added. His statement came a day after Lalu and Paswan joined hands with Mulayam.         
	The joining of hands by the trio would be formally announced on March 30.        
	However, the Congress leader and AICC delegate, Umakant Singh, refused to acknowledge Paswan and Mulayam as secular leaders. Paswan was in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government and Mulayam has befriended Kalyan Singh who presided over the demolition of the Babri mosque, Singh said.

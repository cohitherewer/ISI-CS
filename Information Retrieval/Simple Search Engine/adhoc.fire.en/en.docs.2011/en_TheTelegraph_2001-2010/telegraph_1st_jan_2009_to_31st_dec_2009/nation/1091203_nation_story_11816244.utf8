The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | N-plant goes to cops
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      N-plant goes to cops
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bangalore, Dec. 2: The Kaiga nuclear power station finally lodged a police complaint last night, a week after an alleged mischief maker contaminated a water cooler in the plant with radioactive Tritium.         
	Senior manager (human resource) Umamaheshwaran filed the complaint that said the Karnataka plant suspected mischief by somebody.        
	The complaint was based on our preliminary inquiry, the official told The Telegraph.        
	The FIR came amid voices of concern from state officials and elected representatives who accused the plant authorities of not co-operating with them and delay in informing them about the alleged sabotage.        
	Atomic energy authorities had reported the mischief on Sunday, five days after the heavy water was added to the cooler that led to higher radiation levels in employees of the plant, 450km from Bangalore.        
	Up to now, they were not taking local people into confidence, said Anand Asno-tikar, Karnataka minister for science and technology and MLA of Karwar, the constituency in which Kaiga falls.        
	Asnotikar, who visited the plant on Monday, also voiced concerns about the antecedents of contract workers who are mostly from other places. They get a certificate from their local police which is not verified, he alleged.        
	S. Rajagopal, former secretary of the Atomic Energy Commission, said he didnt read anything foul in the delay. They must have been trying to investigate on their own must have looked into various possibilities. Its a complex system, he added.        
	Rajagopal said Tritium was not highly radioactive, but the cause for concern was the lack of control over nuclear and strategic material. It shows there is some gap somewhere. Thats what is worrying.

	New Delhi, Oct. 26: Pushpam Sinha, the IIT Delhi PhD student accused of murdering a girl on Saturday, was a loner prone to mood swings possibly triggered by an ailment, acquaintances at the institute said today.         
	The 34-year-old Patna youth, who joined the IIT last year, was today remanded in a days police custody for allegedly murdering the 19-year-old Naga girl from Manipur he was interested in dating. Police have ruled out rape.         
	Sinha, pursuing his PhD from the department of applied mechanics, had repeatedly shown signs of drastic mood swings and had few friends.         
	He was unpredictable in his behaviour. He could be extremely friendly one day and could ignore you the next day, an acquaintance said.         
	The police claimed that Sinha suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder  a medical state where the patient suffers from delusions he struggles to break out of.         
	The department faculty revealed that Sinha had shown signs of poor concentration but said he had also shown frequent sparks of intelligence.         
	The institute allotted him a room in Vindhyachal hostel but Sinha soon moved out, indicating that he wanted to live by himself. It is rare for outstation students to spurn hostel accommodation.        
	Sinha was living out of a rented accommodation in Munirka. The police claimed they had found signs suggesting Sinha was manic and a pervert while browsing through his diaries and laptop.        
	The police also claimed that the walls in the room were covered with lewd graffiti.

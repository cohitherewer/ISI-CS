The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Break with BJP sets up third coronation for Naveen 
                                                                                                               Break with BJP sets up third coronation for Naveen 
          SUBRAT DAS                          Naveen Patnaik in Bhubaneswar after the BJDs victory. (AP)                                  
	Bhubaneswar, May 16: Naveen Patnaik got his timing right, after all.        
	The Biju Janata Dal today swept both the Assembly and the Lok Sabha elections, leaving Naveen absolutely humbled by the generosity of the Orissa people.        
	While the BJD won 14 of the 21 Lok Sabha seats, it secured an absolute majority on its own in Orissa, winning 104 of the 142 declared seats in the 147-member Assembly. In 2004, the BJD had won 61 Assembly seats and its alliance partner BJP 32.        
	When Naveen broke with the BJP in March, there had been speculation whether he had waited too long after the Kandhamal riots of August 2008. The BJDs split with its ally of 11 years  it was the first to quit the NDA  was the first hint of trouble for the BJP. He then decided to go for seat-share pacts with the Left and the Nationalist Congress Party.        
	As Naveen today looked set to be crowned chief minister for the third successive term, his pre-poll gambit appeared to have paid off. J.B. Patnaik of the Congress was chief minister thrice, but his reign was not unbroken.        
	I feel absolutely humbled by the tremendous generosity that the people of Orissa have shown my party, Naveen, who had fought the elections on the twin planks of secularism and development, said.        
	Expressing gratitude to the people for appreciating the good work done by his government, he said: We should work much harder to deliver all good things  peace, harmony, development and welfare.        
	The Congress, however, failed to take advantage of the split in votes following the break-up of the BJD-BJP alliance. Hopeful of riding back to power after nine years, the Congress secured only 25 seats against the 38 seats it had won in the 2004 elections.        
	Several veteran Congress leaders, including former ministers Nalinikanta Mohanty, Niranjan Patnaik, Sk Matlub Ali and Suresh Routray and former MP Soumya Ranjan Patnaik, suffered defeats. Old warhorse Nailinikanta Mohanty, who had been winning Rajnagar uninterruptedly since 1977, lost the seat for the first time.         
	Political analysts, who attributed Naveens performance to his decision to dump the BJP, said the Congress had fared poorly as it had failed to project a proper alternative to the BJD boss.        
	Besides, it had not carried out its campaign in an organised way, though Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and son Rahul had electioneered for the party.        
	Orissa Congress chief K.P. Singhdeo, however, alleged that the BJD had surged ahead through money and muscle power and misuse of official machinery.        
	The BJP, which had vowed to teach the BJD a lesson for walking out on it, won only seats despite stalwarts like L.K. Advani, Narendra Modi and Rajnath Singh campaigning in the state.        
	Many senior leaders, including former ministers Biswa Bhusan Harichandan, Manmohan Samal and Samir Dey and party national secretary Dharmendra Pradhan, have licked the dust.

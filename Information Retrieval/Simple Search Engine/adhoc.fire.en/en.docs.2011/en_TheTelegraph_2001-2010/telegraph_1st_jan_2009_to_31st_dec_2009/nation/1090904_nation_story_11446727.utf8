The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Straying animals destroy farms, officials mum
                                                                                                               Straying animals destroy farms, officials mum
          NALIN VERMA                              An antelope and boars at Vaishali. (Deepak Kumar)				                                 
	Patna, Sept. 3: It is feverish problem of epidemic proportions, and yes, swines are involved too.        
	At least 25,000 acres around the confluence of the Ganga and the Son in north Bihars Vaishali are now lying barren, even though the area is touted to be one of the most fertile in the state.         
	Till two years ago, farmlands nestled around this confluence and its adjoining areas produced three crops, plus extra yields of banana and litchis.        
	But now, hordes of Neel Gai and boars moving in herds for grazing are destroying whatever crop farmers are sowing.         
	Clueless as to how to rid the land of antelopes and boars that have destroyed banana, paddy and wheat crops in the past two years, Harinarayan Rai of Karnapura village in Vaishali has not sown anything on his three acres this year.        
	What is the use of farming when we are aware that crops will be destroyed anyway by these antelopes and wild boars. There will no end to our plight until our area is freed from the beasts, Harinarayan told The Telegraph.         
	Kaviji, a resident of Mohanpur village, has gone a step further and is trying to sell-off his land to keep his hearth fire burning.         
	But, there are no buyers as most farmers are impoverished due to the menace, he rued.        
	And unless the Bihar government takes initiatives to make the farms safe, the pretty antelopes would be seen as a menace that travels in hordes and devours acres in a night. Wild boars, too, move in packs, dig the land and destroy crops.         
	A boar bite also requires an immediate anti-rabies injection, which is not readily available in rural areas.        
	Convenor of Bhumi Sena, the state-level farmers body, Brajesh Kumar Rai expressed his annoyance with the government and the administration for their inaction against the invasion.         
	The panel had spoken to the chief minister, Nitish Kumar, at the latters janata durbar, while representatives had raised it in the Bihar Assembly.         
	But officials state their hands are tied especially with stringent forest conservation laws in place that prohibit any sort of hunting.         
	Brajesh Kumar said: Some better-off farmers cordoned off their farmlands with wires to prevent the animals from entering their fields in Karnpura.         
	But animals broke through these cordons easily, destroying crops and the farmers investments.         
	District forest officers admit that the stretch around the confluence of the Ganga and the Son have a population of 5,000 and more boars and antelopes.        
	But, we are not empowered to hunt these animals and we can not chase them out to other areas as it would not solve any problem, said a senior forest officer, adding: Special instructions from forest conservation ministry and government can save the situation.

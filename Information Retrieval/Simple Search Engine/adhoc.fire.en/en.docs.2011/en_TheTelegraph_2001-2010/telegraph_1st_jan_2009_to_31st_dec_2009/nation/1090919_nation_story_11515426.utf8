The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | RJD-LJP gains lost ground in Bihar
                                                                                                               RJD-LJP gains lost ground in Bihar
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Sept. 18: Poll pundits wrote Lalu Prasad off when the RLD-LJP combination suffered a rout in the Lok Sabha polls three months ago.        
	They also predicted that Nitish Kumar-led NDA would have a smooth run in the bypoll, which was being described as the semi-final before the state general Assembly elections to be held in 2010.        
	But, Lalu-led combination stunned observers by winning nine against NDAs five seats, besides giving a resounding blow to the chief minister, who rode on anti-Lalu sentiment to power in 2005 and won all polls afterwards.        
	Question remains as to how an embattled RJD boss, shunted by the Congress-led government at the Centre and deserted by loyalists back home, brought about a coupe signalling tough times for Nitish Kumar.        
	Senior RJD ideologue and state party chief Abdul Bari Sidiqui said: Robbed of power, ditched by loyalists and ignored by the media, Lalu got back to the basics. He and Ram Vilas Paswan, Bihars tallest Dalit leader, sweated in the hinterland operating among backward classes, who saw him as their messiah. On the other hand, Nitishs JD(U)-BJP combine rejoiced in the glory of victory ignoring the people who had voted him to power.        
	The first step that Lalu took was to cement ties with Ram Vilas Paswan, his bitter foe for over five years. Stooping to conquer, Lalu at times played second fiddle to Paswan giving him five seats among the 18 to win back Dalit support.        
	He also chose his candidates intelligently. For instance, Lalu fielded Bishwanath Gupta, a bania from Munger, a seat won by JD(U) state chief Lallan Singh in the past Lok Sabha polls. As a result, banias, combined with Yadavs and Paswans  LJP-RLDs core vote  trounced JD(U), who had to depend on upper caste Bhumihar votes, which, too, had turned their back to JD(U) after the party began to promote EBCs.        
	While Nitish spoke for the cause of Mahadalits, Lalu worked at the grassroots fielding a Mahadalit, Udai Majhi, from the JD(U) on an RJD ticket. Majhi trounced Shyam Razak, an RJD renegade who already had strong anti-incumbency factor against him in Phulwari Sharief.        
	Moreover, Nitish described the emergence of Congress in the bypoll as a reason for the RJD-LJP win. The chief minister may be right in his assessment as Bhumihars, Brahmins and Rajputs, upper caste groups feeling ignored by the Nitish rule, got an option in the Congress. For the first time in the four years, several people voted for the Congress leading it to equal its tally to BJPs two and depriving the NDA of militant support groups which had backed the combination in the Lok Sabha polls and previous bypolls.        
	Last but not the least, Lalu changed his campaign style. While, Nitish delivered speeches, the former RJD boss tried door-to-door campaign, literally begging for voetes stating: Merey malikon; mera khana dana kyon chhina, mujhase kya galti hua.         
	Thus, he struck an emotional chord while Nitish functioned in a much too professional manner that people from the hinterland saw as arrogance.        
	RJD general secretary and Lalu loyalist, Ramkripal Yadav sums up: Hamaray neta se log rooth gaya thaa. Laluji ne roothi janata ko mana liya. (People were miffed with Lalu. He won them back.        
	The electoral blow has surely shaken Nitishs confidence ahead of Assembly polls.        
	However, he, too, is a master of comeback. After leaving Lalu Prasad, his Samata Party won only four Assembly seats in 1995, but fighting hard he rode to power in 2005. JD(U) believe that the setback will alert a Nitish ahead of the Assembly polls.

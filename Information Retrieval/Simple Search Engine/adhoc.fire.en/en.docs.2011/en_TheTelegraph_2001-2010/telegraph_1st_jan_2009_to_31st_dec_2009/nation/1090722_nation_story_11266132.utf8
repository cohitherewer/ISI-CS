The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | A Bangla border force like the BSF 
                                                                                                               A Bangla border force like the BSF 
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, July 21: A little brother for the BSF. And they are going to look similar, too.        
	Bangladesh border force BDR will soon pass into history, to be born again in a new avatar strikingly similar to its Indian counterpart.        
	Sources said the Border Guards of Bangladesh  or the Bangladesh Border Guards  would have sectors and regions like that of the BSF, which played a key role in helping Dhaka structure the new force. The BDR even wants an intelligence wing like the BSF, said a source.        
	If the BDR in its new incarnation is shaping up to look like the BSFs younger brother, its the unity on the 4,096km eastern border that is striking.        
	Trust between the two forces had been increasing over the past three years but reached a new high during the mutiny in the BDR earlier this year when the Indian force helped maintain peace on the border.        
	Last week, BDR director-general Moinul Islam and his BSF counterpart M.L. Kumawat discussed changes in the soon-to-be-reborn forces structure in Dhaka. The two sides also decided to fight smuggling together, sources said. Sources in the security establishment see this as a sign of stability on the eastern front.         
	Islam is understood to be continuing the relationship his predecessor Major General Shakeel Ahmed shared with his BSF counterpart before his death in the mutiny.

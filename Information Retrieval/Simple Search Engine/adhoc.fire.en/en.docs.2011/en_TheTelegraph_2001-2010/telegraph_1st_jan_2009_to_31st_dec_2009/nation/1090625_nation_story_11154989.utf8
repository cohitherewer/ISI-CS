          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, June 24: The Centre will keep a tight vigil if industries come up in Nayachar, union environment minister Jairam Ramesh said today.        
	Speaking on the sidelines of a Zoological Survey of India programme in Calcutta, Ramesh said the Centre expected the state government to adhere to strictest environmental standards while building the PCPIR (petroleum, chemical, petrochemical investment region) off Haldia.        
	The Bengal government and its private partner for the project, New Kolkata International Development, are yet to make a formal application to the Centre for environmental clearance.        
	We will look into the matter cautiously given that the project will come up on an island, Ramesh said.        
	It takes 210 days to get the environment clearance. Since Nayachar falls under the coastal regulatory zone, a further clearance would be required.

          SUJAN DUTTA                          An Ilyushin 76                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 2: Indian Air Force headquarters was today thinking of grounding its Ilyushin 76 fleet and has asked the manufacturers for advice after Russia ordered the heavy transport planes back to hangars following a crash.        
	The IAF operates two squadrons of the aircraft (17) in its transport fleet that ferries troops from difficult terrain  Kashmir and the Northeast  almost daily, and was also used last month to move paramilitary forces for counter-Maoist operations in Maharashtra.        
	Grounding the aircraft will severely impact the air forces daily maintenance operations. Hundreds of Indian Army soldiers are dependent on courier services run by the IAF on its IL-76 aircraft.        
	Variants of the aircraft are also the basic platforms for surveillance missions by the Aviation Research Centre  an intelligence agency  and are also operated as mid-air refuellers and for Indias only airborne early warning and command system.        
	IAF authorities told The Telegraph the transport directorate at air headquarters was in touch with the two makers of the aircraft  Ilyushin Aviation Complex Joint Stock Company, Moscow, and Tashkent Aircraft Production Corporation in Uzbekistan.        
	We are waiting for communication from the companies. We are checking out what has happened, an IAF source said.        
	Sources in air headquarters said the authorities were worried after the Russian Air Force reported two IL-76 mishaps in less than a month.        
	On October 7, one of the four huge D30KP turbofan engines of an IL-76 fell off as it was preparing to take off. There was no casualty. The Russian Air Force had grounded the IL-76 after that incident but the IAF did not.        
	But on Sunday, another IL-76 doing duty for the Russian interior ministry crashed in Siberia, killing all 11 crew and passengers (troops) on board.         
	News reports from Russia said the aircraft failed to gain height though it was being powered on full throttle.

	 Hyderabad, Sept. 27 (PTI): Congress supporters of Jaganmohan Reddy tore a poster of party chief Sonia Gandhi for not making the son of the late Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy the Andhra Pradesh chief minister.          
	The incident, which happened at the Khammam district Congress office two days ago, came to light today after a television channel showed it. Andhra chief minister K. Rosaiah, who succeeded Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, condemned the incident but asked Sonia to pardon the Congress supporters. Jaganmohan himself expressed anguish, saying he was deeply disturbed about the incident.                   
	 New Delhi (PTI): A jawan has to be given four days by the army before he is court-martialled, the Supreme Court has ruled. The Centre had argued that the 96-hour gap stipulated by court martial rules between the laying of charges and the trial was not mandatory, but the apex court rejected this.

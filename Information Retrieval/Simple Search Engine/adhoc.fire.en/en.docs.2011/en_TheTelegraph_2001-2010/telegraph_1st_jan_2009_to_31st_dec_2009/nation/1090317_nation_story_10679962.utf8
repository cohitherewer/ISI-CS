          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Divine politician?                                  
	Patna, March 16: One Rajeshwar Yadav was arrested today for trying to build a Lalu-Rabri temple at Alampur in central Bihars Rohtas district, some 200km from here, at an estimated cost of Rs 54 lakh.         
	Rajeshwar, arrested for violating the code of conduct, is a die-hard supporter of Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi. He performed a bhumi pujan on 2,800-sqft designated for the temple at Alampur on March 1. The work was on in a brisk pace while the model code of conduct came into force. The Rohtas superintendent of police Vikas Vaibhav said the force arrested Rajeshwar after consulting the Representation of Peoples Act and stopped temple construction. However, they later released Rajeshwar Yadav on bail after lodging a case against him.         
	Mukhiya Devi, the Yadavs mother, has been playing the lead role in the construction. She donated the land and collected subscriptions from people for the construction.         
	Calling the Lalu-Rabri duo the incarnation of Krishna and Radha, Mukhiya Devi said that the couple had worked for the downtrodden all their lives. They have protected the honour and prestige of the poor.

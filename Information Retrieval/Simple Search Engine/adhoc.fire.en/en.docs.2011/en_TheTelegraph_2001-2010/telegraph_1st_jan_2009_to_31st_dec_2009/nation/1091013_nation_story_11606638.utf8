                                                                                                               Post-poll bonhomie over, Nitish hits out at Cong
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	Patna, Oct. 12: After a pause in the wake of the partys debacle in the September by-elections, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar today resumed janata ke durbar mein mukhyamantri programme.        
	Putting the bypoll setback behind, Nitish said: We had trounced them (RJD-LJP and Congress) in Lok Sabha polls early this year. We will politically obliterate them in the Assembly polls next year, which will be the final battle.        
	In the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls, Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi had uttered words of praise for Nitishs good governance and some Union ministers, too, had grudgingly uttered good words about him.         
	On his part, Nitish, too, went soft while criticising Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the Congress leadership.         
	But, the days of bonhomie seems to be over, with Sonia Gandhis party trying to revive itself in Bihar and locking horns with the Nitish-led NDA government on several issues.         
	The chief minister admitted that Congresss decision to contest on all 18 seats in the bypoll affected the JD(U) and party strategists have allegedly insisted that a soft stand on the Congress will prove to be counter-productive.         
	Understandably, Nitish has turned acerbic on the Congress and Centre of late. Asked to comment on the central governments war on Maoists, the chief minister said: The Centre only talks. It does not act. It has been sleeping over our demand of flood relief and drought packages and special category status for a long time now.        
	It seems, Bihars ruling party has now decided to slot its rivals  RJD-LJP and Congress  in the same bracket.         
	The Congress and the LJP-RJD combination are hand-in-gloves. As a part of their well-oiled strategy to defeat the NDA, they have been contesting the polls separately, said state JD(U) chief Lallan Singh.         
	He described the RJD and Congress as two sides of the same coin.        
	For the first time after the bypoll, the chief minister lashed out at Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan today.         
	Yesterday, Lalu Prasad had organised a meeting of party workers, asking them to be disciplined and polite while meeting people. Go to the people of all castes and communities, he had asked his workers.         
	Nitish today laughed at his rivals suggestion. Laluji and discipline are antonym. Laluji and discipline can not stay together in a sentence.         
	I believe that people still remember how thousands of unruly cadre escorted Lalu Prasad when he was to surrender before the court. He has never been a disciplined politician, added state JD(U) chief Lallan Singh.        
	Nitish also took on Ram Vilas Paswan for giving a caste colour to the carnage of 16 people at Amausi-Bahiar village in Khagaria recently. They (Lalu and Paswan) are capable of anything to come to power, he said, adding: The JD(U) is ready to face any challenge posed by the opposition. He reiterated his intention to keep on working for the uplift of the weaker sections and minorities.         
	The chief minister also plans to embark on his mass contact plan soon.

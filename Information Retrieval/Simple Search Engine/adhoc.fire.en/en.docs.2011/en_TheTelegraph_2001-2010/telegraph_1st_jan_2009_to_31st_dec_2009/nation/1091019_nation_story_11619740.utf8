The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Power woes to plague Orissa
                                                                                                               Power woes to plague Orissa
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 18: Once a state with a power surplus, Orissa is now headed towards a severe scarcity due to a fall in water level in reservoirs affecting hydro-electricity generation.        
	The state is likely to experience blackouts for three to six hours every day from November, official sources said.        
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Thursday chaired a meeting on the power scarcity and tried to figure out a phase-wise minimised duration of power cuts till the crisis is over. We are planning to manage the situation keeping in mind consumers discomfort, particularly farmers, said Naveen, after the meeting.        
	Water levels in reservoirs went down due to less rainfall in catchment areas affecting hydro-power generation. The state is expected to receive 4,000 million units of hydro-electricity this year, as against previous years 6,000 million units. Power stations are unable to deliver their full potential due to a shortage of coal, too, while independent power producers, who signed MoUs with the state, are running behind their operation schedule.        
	The states present power demand in peak hours is 2700-2900MW, which is expected to rise up to 3,000MW during summer. The average shortfall will be around 600-700MW, forcing the state to take the extreme step.        
	Meanwhile, Orissa Power Transmission Company Limited has requested the Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commission to allow imposition of loadshedding. Acting on a request, the regulatory commission has initiated a process of finalising a model load regulation and issued a public notice soliciting views of organisations, distribution companies and public by October 25.        
	We are making efforts to procure power from other sources to minimise the duration of power cuts, said energy minister Atanu Sabyasachi Nayak.        
	Nayak said that the government had requested Sterlite Energy and Bhusan Power, who are going to commission thermal unit with installed capacity of 600MW and 300MW, respectively, by end of January, to provide power to the state.        
	Steps are being taken to expedite thermal projects for which MoUs have been signed, the minister said, adding that progress of eight such projects, in their advanced stages, would be reviewed.

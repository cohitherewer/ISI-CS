          G.C. SHEKHAR AMP; AGENCIES                          Lawyers shout slogans as they are taken away in a police vehicle after their arrest in Chennai on Friday. (Reuters)                                  
	Chennai, Feb. 20: A CBI inquiry was today ordered into yesterdays lawyer-police clashes at Madras High Court as protests spread beyond Chennai and MLAs railing against the mayhem were evicted from the Assembly.        
	Over 150 lawyers who tried to march to the secretariat from the high court were taken into custody this morning, after the DMK government announced the probe.        
	Elsewhere, three state buses parked inside the Madurai court complex were set ablaze late last night, while a police jeep was attacked in Coimbatore this morning. In Nagercoil, lawyers damaged vehicles in the district court complex. Late tonight, the state police chief issued shoot-at-sight orders against trouble-makers.        
	In the Assembly, Opposition legislators of the ADMK, PMK, MDMK and the Left were ordered out after they demanded a discussion on yesterdays chaos, which had seen a stone land on a judges forehead and another judge fall.        
	The MLAs were not satisfied with the government version of the clashes given by law minister Durai Murugan, who also iterated chief minister M. Karunanidhis announcement of a CBI probe earlier in the day.        
	The lawyer protests continued despite acting chief justice S.J. Mukhopadhyaya having declared a holiday for all courts in the state today.         
	At the high court, members of the Tamil Nadu Bar Council observed a days fast demanding immediate action against the police officers who were responsible for the alleged excesses.        
	State police chief K.P. Jain ruled out any action against the policemen till the CBI completed its investigation.         
	There had been lawlessness (involving the lawyers) in various parts of the state and what happened on Thursday was a culmination (of the troubles).        
	ADMK general secretary J. Jayalalithaa seized on the violence to demand the state governments dismissal, saying the injuries suffered by a judge showed there was no protection even for judges inside the high court.        
	Late this evening, the chief minister urged all political parties not to give room for further aggravation of the lawyer agitation till the CBI probe was over.        
	Some senior advocates blamed the judges for being too lenient with a handful of troublemakers who could have been isolated and reined in if the bench had passed orders against their political activities in the court complex.         
	Even when Subramanian Swamy is attacked before two judges, they (the judges) merely file a report instead of naming the lawyers and having them booked, a senior lawyer said. Pro-LTTE lawyers had pelted the Janata Party leader with rotten eggs on Tuesday for demanding Tiger chief Prabhakarans deportation.

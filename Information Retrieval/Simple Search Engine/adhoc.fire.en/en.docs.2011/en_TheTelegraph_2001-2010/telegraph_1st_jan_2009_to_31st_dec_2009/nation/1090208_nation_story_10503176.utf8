          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Some of the accused in the Bangalore blast case after their arrest. (Bangalore News Photo)                                  
	Bangalore, Feb. 7: The anti-terror cell of Karnataka police today claimed it had cracked the Bangalore July 2008 blasts with the arrest of nine persons, eight of whom belong to a Kerala-based terror module        
	The group, disguised as day labourers, had planted nine low-intensity bombs, of which eight exploded killing one person. The ninth was defused.        
	Some of the arrested members were allegedly trained by Lashkar militants in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.        
	The bombs were assembled by Abdul Sattar, an electronic engineer with expertise in bomb making. He was caught by Hyderabad police last month. He also put together the team.        
	We also learned that he was assisted by Bhatkal and Tauqeer alias Abdul Subhan. The latter set up the tech wing of the Students Islamic Movement of India, an ATS officer said.        
	Based on what Sattar said, seven others were arrested in Kerala, one of who is his own son Safrudeen. Another person, Mohammed Sami of Bijapur, was nabbed by Karnataka police.        
	Bangalore police commissioner Shankar Bidari told reporters the team drove down to Bangalore from Kerala in a Scorpio disguised as casual labourers and planted the bombs on pavements and covered them with trash.        
	Their motive was to cause shock and havoc in the city, he said.        
	The police are on the look out for Bhatkal and Tauqeer.

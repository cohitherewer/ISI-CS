          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, July 24: Chhattisgarh will be the first state in the country to introduce a Right to Food Act to ensure food security in the state.         
	The Chhattisgarh government will soon table the legislation in the Vidhan Sabha to formulate an act that will ensure food security for the poor people in the state, said chief minister Raman Singh in the Assembly today.         
	Officials of the concerned department are currently working on the draft and the legislation will be given its final shape soon, he said, adding that the details of the proposal cannot be revealed as the government would soon table the legislation.         
	Singh said after enacting the law, Chhattisgarh will become the first state in the country to enact a Food Security Act.        
	The process for introducing the act began eight months ago when the state organised a workshop on this issue and invited experts suggestions.         
	The chief minister said his government was committed to work for the poor and farmers in the state. It was because of this commitment that we introduced the subsidised rice scheme that later became popular, he said.         
	Following the states model, the Union government, too, decided to introduce the same across the country, he claimed. Under the subsidised rice scheme, the government is providing 30kg of rice and 5kg of wheat every month to poor people at a subsidised rate. Antyodhaya cardholders receive foodgrain for Re 1 a kilogram, while BPL families have to pay Rs 2 for the same.

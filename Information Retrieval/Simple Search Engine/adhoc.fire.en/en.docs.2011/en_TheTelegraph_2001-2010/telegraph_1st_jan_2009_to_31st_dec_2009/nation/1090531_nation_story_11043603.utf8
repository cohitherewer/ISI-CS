The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Overworked? Chavan says hes fine with five
                                                                                                               Overworked? Chavan says hes fine with five
          G.S. MUDUR                          Chavan: No problems?                                  
	New Delhi, May 30: Sections of Indias scientific community appeared concerned about an overworked minister with five portfolios.        
	Prithviraj Chavan, the new minister of state with independent charge of science and technology and earth sciences, is also minister of state in the Prime Ministers Office; minister of state for personnel, public grievances and pensions; and minister of state for parliamentary affairs.        
	Chavan, a postgraduate in engineering who had studied at the Birla Institute of Technology and Sciences, Pilani, and the University of California, Berkeley, today appeared to be seeking to allay concerns about overwork. Minutes after arriving at his new science and technology office, he told a group of policy makers and reporters that science and technology was his first love.        
	The concerns spring, as one source said, from the shift of the ministry from a cabinet minister looking after it to a minister with five portfolios.         
	Kapil Sibal was science minister in the earlier UPA regime. Were wondering will the new minister have enough time for all portfolios? the source said.        
	But some policy makers say they are also viewing the development with optimism. His position in the PMO could help take scientists voices to the Prime Minister, and that could be a great advantage, said a senior scientist.        
	Two science policy makers told The Telegraph that they believe the movement of Sibal to human resource development could have a beneficial impact on Indias progress in science and technology.        
	We have a human resources problem in science and technology and they need to be addressed, ideally, from the HRD ministry. Sibal has spent five years with us, and understands our needs and our problems, a scientist said.        
	Indias scientific institutions have been worried about the calibre of scientists and engineers they are able to attract from Indias universities and technical education institutions.         
	These institutions are feeding us our human resources, but the quality needs to improve, one scientist said.         
	Researchers believe improvements could be made through changes initiated by the HRD ministry.         
	For instance, the All India Council of Technical Education (Indias apex agency that regulates technical education) needs to be overhauled, but that has to be done from within the HRD ministry, a science ministry official said.        
	Some big ideas (from science and technology) must flow to catch the peoples imagination, Chavan said in his first comments to scientists, urging that some projects should aim at direct societal benefits.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Vijay Krishna and Nitish Kumar                                  
	Patna, June 14: In its bid to zero in on the murderer of Satyendra Singh, police have made Nitish Kumar uncomfortable. For, a senior JD(U) leader  that too the chief ministers childhood friend  has been accused of the crime.        
	Vijay Krishna, former MP who defeated Nitish on an RJD ticket in Barh in 2004, recently joined the JD(U) in his presence. Ironically, the image conscious chief minister  whose regime has sponsored speedy trial of criminals ensuring conviction  does not wish to give any impression that he would directly or indirectly defend his friend. In fact, Nitish is said to be repenting his decision to include Krishna in the party.        
	The court has issued warrant of arrest against the former MP and his son following complaints by Singhs relatives.        
	Singh, an aide to Krishna, was last seen with him on May 23 near a car garage in Boring Road here. Singhs family members lodged an FIR about his abduction on May 24. The police, on the basis of interrogation of Krishnas servant Gangan and bodyguard Umesh Singh, suspected Krishnas son Chanakya alias Guddu who had shot Singh in presence of Krishna and threw the body packed in a trunk in the Ganga.        
	Navy divers recovered it from the Ganga bank at Gulbi Ghat on June 11. The family members identified the body.        
	Inspector-general (headquarters) Neelmani said that earlier the fishermen had fished out the trunk containing the body. They removed the body from the trunk and then they took the trunk along with them. The police have asked the fishermen concerned to return the trunk for the purpose of evidence and investigation.        
	Neelamani said that a special task force had been constituted to arrest Krishna and his son who are absconding.        
	According to sources, Krishnas son did not want Singh to function as political aide to his father. This rivalry is stated to be the reason behind the murder.

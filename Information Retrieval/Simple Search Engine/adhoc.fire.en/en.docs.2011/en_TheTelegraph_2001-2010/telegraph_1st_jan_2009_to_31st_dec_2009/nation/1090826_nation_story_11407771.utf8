The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Wanted, seal for Rahul to intervene
                                                                                                               Wanted, seal for Rahul to intervene
          RASHEED KIDWAI AND RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Rahul Gandhi                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 25: A Supreme Court judgment may come handy as the Congress hunts for an institutional mechanism to allow Rahul Gandhi to put his stamp on government policy.        
	The apex court yesterday upheld Parliaments sole right to decide which posts to exempt from the office-of-profit law, triggering speculation in the party that the National Advisory Council (NAC) may be revived.        
	Sonia Gandhi had quit as NAC chief in 2006 after controversy broke out over MPs holding offices of profit, which led to the council being wound up.        
	The court ruling comes at a time Rahul has joined Manmohan Singh and Sonia as the third power centre in the UPA and has been leaving his imprint on the Congress organisation. But he has not exercised similar influence on government policy, probably for lack of an official vantage point  and lack of desire to seem to be butting in.        
	The party wants Rahul to take up a role similar to Sonias in UPA I, when she piloted all the governments social projects  rural job and health schemes, right to information, tribal rights through the NAC.        
	Congress sources today wondered who would head the council if it was resurrected following the court ruling Sonia or Rahul?        
	Both of them should be in the panel, said some, arguing that both need an institutionalised mechanism to have a say in governance. Sonia, however, may not want to have the mother-son combination in any structure outside the Congress organisation.        
	Even if Rahul wants a say in policies, he does not now have an institutional mechanism, a Congress source said. He has confined himself to conveying his ideas, such as a Bundelkhand development authority, through a delegation. So the effort acquired a political colour and was not seen as a serious initiative.        
	The Congresss urgency for an official advisory role for Rahul has increased after the Bundelkhand flop.        
	Although he and the Prime Minister are known to be agreed on key issues, sources said the Amethi MP consciously wanted to stay out of the governments hair.        
	If he is seen as a bit interventionist, our party will lose no time in spreading the word that he is poised to take over as Prime Minister. He wants none of that, the source said.        
	One option Congress leaders had been thinking about was to have a functioning bridge between Singh and Rahul. The source suggested someone like Pulak Chatterjee would have been ideal.        
	The 1974 batch IAS officer was a secretary in Singhs first Prime Ministers Office (PMO) and was also close to Sonia. He had caught Rajiv Gandhis attention as district magistrate of Rae Bareli and gone on to become officer on special duty to Sonia when she was leader of the Opposition in 1999. He later functioned as an invisible interface between the PMO and Sonia.        
	The current PMO doesnt have an official who is equally close to the Prime Minister and the Congress president. The minister of state in the PMO, Prithviraj Chavan, could have been given the job but only at the cost of upsetting power equations in the Congress.        
	Senior Congress leaders Digvijay Singh and Jairam Ramesh, who have a comfort level with Rahul, are out for the same reason. Digvijay is also at ease with the Prime Minister, having been among the first in the Congress to bat for the nuclear deal.        
	Sources said that so far, the best bet had been to leave it to Manmohan Singh to second guess Rahul. During his first tenure, he had quickly grasped Rahuls eagerness to see the rural job scheme extended to all the districts. The move paid huge electoral dividends.

	Mumbai, Nov. 14 (PTI): The Raj Thackeray-led Maharashtra Navnirman Sena has written to the State Bank of India to give priority to local people in recruitment.         
	We have written a letter to the SBI administration demanding consideration of locals on priority for 1,100 clerical posts announced by them, MNS general secretary Shirish Parkar said.        
	The SBI is holding an entrance exam in the city tomorrow and the administration has assured the MNS it would speak to the authorities in Delhi about the partys demand. The SBI has received about 1.5 lakh applications of which 70 per cent are from outsiders. The posts are local, and Marathi people should get priority, Parkar said.

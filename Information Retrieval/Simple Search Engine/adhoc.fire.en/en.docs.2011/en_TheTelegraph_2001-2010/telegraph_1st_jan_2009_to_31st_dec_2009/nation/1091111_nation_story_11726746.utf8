          SANJAY K. JHA                              Dimple Yadav before the elections, Raj Babbar collects the victory certificate in Firozabad on Tuesday. (PTI)				                                 
	New Delhi, Nov. 10: The Congresss joy at the Firozabad bypoll victory has come tempered with the sombre message that the growing tendency among leaders to push their family members into politics has begun to put off the voter.        
	Although loud chants about a Congress revival in Uttar Pradesh were heard today, senior leaders conceded that Raj Babbars success lay in exposing Mulayam Singh Yadavs ploy of perpetuating family rule in the name of socialism.        
	Babbar defeated Mulayams daughter-in-law Dimple Yadav by over 85,000 votes in the Samajwadi citadel of Firozabad.        
	Digvijay Singh, the Congress general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh, said the result reflected the peoples rejection of Mulayams dynasty politics. This was a bold statement from a leader of a party viewed as the original wellspring of dynasty politics in this country.        
	Congress leaders, however, are now willing to confront the question, probably because it is acquiring serious proportions.        
	Party leaders, big or small, national or state-level, have brazenly tried to promote their children in recent elections. Many chief ministers have got their sons elected to the Lok Sabha in the recent past.        
	Congress sources said Sonia Gandhi was extremely unhappy at this trend and was particularly disturbed by the developments in Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra.        
	While Jaganmohan Reddy had run a hawkish campaign for the chief ministers post after his father Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddys death, almost all senior party leaders sought tickets for their sons or daughters in the Maharashtra elections.        
	What rattled Sonia the most was President Pratibha Patils insistence on a ticket for his son, the sources said.        
	They added that Sonia could not be ruthless with these claimants since the Nehru-Gandhi family too faces the same charge. But now there is a move to insulate the first family from the mushrooming little dynasties, especially after Rahul Gandhi himself described dynasty politics as a problem.        
	Party general secretary Janardan Dwivedi, the chief Congress spokesperson, told The Telegraph: Dynasty without service and sacrifice will not be tolerated by the people.        
	He was obliquely attempting to draw a line between the Nehru-Gandhis and other leaders who push their wards into politics.        
	Dwivedi agreed that all political parties needed to learn from the Firozabad result, but took pot shots at Mulayam: Some ideals have to be there in politics. All parties have a tradition of family politics but karm-viheen parivarwaad (dynasty politics without achievement) will be rejected. Those who are doing politics in the name of (Ram Manohar) Lohia should follow his principles. He used to say leaders should refrain from nepotism and money-making.        
	Mulayam is bound to respond strongly to this sort of attack, but the Congress wouldnt have raised the dynasty angle had it not been prepared to debate the issue thoroughly.        
	Sonia herself is keen to send out a message that leaders children do not have a birthright to retain the political legacy. Congress leaders claim that this was why she persisted with Manmohan Singh as Prime Minister despite the growing clamour for Rahul. Rahul himself has chosen a rigorous political apprenticeship to gain experience.        
	The sources said there would be a stricter ticket policy for leaders relatives in future. Although many senior leaders children won in Maharashtra, the dynasty trend cost the Congress heavily in recent Gujarat and Delhi bypolls.        
	Winnability cannot be the only criterion, a senior leader said.         
	The party is not a cradle for the children of big leaders. This message has to go out to the millions of ordinary workers who too have aspirations.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Home turf gears up to repay debt
                                                                                                               Home turf gears up to repay debt
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                          Ramalinga Raju: Not alone                                  
	Hyderabad, Jan. 13: B. Ramalinga Raju gave them drinking water, the Internet, schools and, above all, pride in their community. The Rajus of his district now want to repay him by rallying to his support.        
	A Save Ramalinga Raju campaign has been holding prayers and candlelight marches in the Bhimavaram and Narsapuram Assembly constituencies of West Godavari district demanding bail for the former Satyam chairman.        
	The campaigners see Ramalinga Raju as a highly educated entrepreneur with a sense of social responsibility, and say his aberration with balance sheets should be ignored.        
	Well hold a massive rally in Bhimavaram town on January 23, said P. Venugopala Raju of Narsapuram, who heads the campaign.        
	I am proud of Ramalinga Raju; he placed Bhimavaram on the world map and took up social welfare and community development projects worth millions, Venugopala, member of a cultural organisation of Rajus in West Godavari, said over the phone.        
	Asked if he thought Ramalinga Rajus conduct was correct, he shot back: Why dont you ask the politicians how many thousands of crores they have siphoned off for personal gain?        
	Ramalinga Rajus portrait hangs in almost every home in the 20-odd villages of Bhimavaram and Narsapuram, dominated by the Kshatriya Raju community, that have benefited from his drinking water project.        
	After he was taken to Chanchalguda jail in Hyderabad on Saturday night, people in the two constituencies held special prayers at temples, churches and mosques seeking their icons well-being.         
	Prayers were held also at the school in Ramalinga Rajus native village, Garagaparru, near Bhimavaram.        
	The Save Ramalinga Raju campaigners plan to take their movement from village to village and explain how their man was made a pawn in power politics.        
	They have asked supporters to flood the Bombay Stock Exchange, the criminal investigation department and Satyams new management with letters, text messages and emails of support for Ramalinga Raju.        
	The former Satyam chief has supporters even in Hyderabad.         
	A handful of admirers performed a yagna for him and his family at the Varasiddhi Vinayaka temple in Kukatpally on the citys outskirts yesterday. Among them were Satyam shareholders and an employee.        
	Ramalinga Rajus neighbours on Road No. 62, Jubilee Hills, said they hardly saw the businessman since he rarely spent more than three nights together in Hyderabad.        
	We sometimes met his wife Nandini when she went out on morning walks. She also attended some colony meets, a neighbour said.        
	For the past few days, the family has stayed indoors and has not been meeting people.

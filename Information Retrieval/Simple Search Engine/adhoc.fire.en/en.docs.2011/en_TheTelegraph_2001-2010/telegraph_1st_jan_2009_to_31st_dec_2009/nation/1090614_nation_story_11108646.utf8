The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sibal quota test in Agartala highway divide
                                                                                                               Sibal quota test in Agartala highway divide
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, June 13: A road cutting through Agartala has emerged as a line of fissure dividing two conflicting options on reservations in education for human resource development minister Kapil Sibal in his first test on the controversial policy.         
	On the west of National Highway 44 stands the centrally run Tripura University which implements all reservations mandated by New Delhi  for Schedules Castes, Scheduled Tribes and, more recently, for Other Backward Classes.         
	On the east of the highway, the National Institute of Technology (NIT) is also a central institution but is not required to follow central quotas as it falls in a Sixth Schedule area.         
	Although institutions in Sixth Schedule territories under the Constitution were exempt from all quotas under the OBC reservations law of 2006, the HRD ministry continued with existing SC/ST reservations at the NIT.         
	Now, a Gauhati High Court order striking down the SC/ST quotas in the NIT is forcing the ministry to pick between sticking to the law as it exists and amending it to ensure reservations continue.         
	Senior ministry sources said both options were being considered but that Sibal, a lawyer by training, was keen to avert future legal complications over reservations.         
	Sibal is expected to meet his officials as a top priority after returning next week from an education conference in Singapore to firm up the governments strategy, the sources said.         
	It will have to be a political decision as either choice could kick up a furore that may affect electoral prospects far beyond Tripura, a senior official said.         
	The decision may also reveal Sibals views on reservations. Unlike his predecessor Arjun Singh, who fathered OBC reservations in higher education, Sibal is perceived by many as keen to look at alternative methods of social justice and equity.         
	In 2006, Sibal had visited students protesting against OBC reservations at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, angering pro-quota students.         
	But withdrawing quotas as HRD minister could be politically hard.         
	Tripura higher education minister Anil Sarkar, of the CPM, has written to Sibal seeking his prompt intervention to ensure that SC/ST reservations continue in the NIT.         
	Ending SC/ST quotas is likely to hurt the Congresss nationwide image as a party that supports traditionally backward communities.         
	But amending the OBC quota law to allow central reservations for SC/STs in demarcated Sixth Schedule areas may be contrary to the vision behind creating these autonomous territories.         
	Regions in the Northeast with a disproportionately high percentage of tribal residents can be recommended for Sixth Schedule status by concerned states to their governors.

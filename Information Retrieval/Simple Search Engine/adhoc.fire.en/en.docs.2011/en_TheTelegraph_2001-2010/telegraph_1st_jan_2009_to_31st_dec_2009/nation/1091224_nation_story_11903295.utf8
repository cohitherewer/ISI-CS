The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | America flashes visa virus alert
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      America flashes visa virus alert
          K.P. NAYAR                              
	Washington, Dec. 23: The US government has just stopped short of asking its citizens not to visit India in the light of mounting tales of harassment of Americans by immigration officials at airports across the country.        
	The harassment is the result of severely red faces in the Union home ministry over revelations that not only David Coleman Headley, but Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, also visited India with impunity.        
	Adding to the pressure on the home ministry to take draconian measures against arriving foreign tourists, those fighting turf battles against North Block have dug up proof showing that Masood Azhar, head of the terrorist outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed, arrived in Delhi on a questionable Portuguese passport in 1994. Waved in by immigration officials, he went on to co-ordinate several terrorist plots on Indian soil.        
	It is the contention of South Block and others engaged in these turf battles that North Block lost no sleep for as long as 15 years over these gaps in internal security which may have contributed to the planning of the Mumbai attacks last year.        
	But because immigration officials at Indian airports are now suddenly going to another extreme and treating almost every arriving foreigner as a potential terrorist, the US embassy in New Delhi has issued the following advice to citizens planning trips to India: American citizens travelling to, or departing from, India are urged to review travel plans in light of these changing procedures.        
	This is just short of asking Americans not to travel to India, a step the US state department took following the December 2001 attack on Parliament.        
	The then US ambassador, Robert Blackwill, had enraged South Block when he ordered the evacuation of embassy staff members.        
	Sensitive to the uproar he caused in South Block, the US embassy in New Delhi and its consulates elsewhere in the country have this time asked American citizens planning to visit India to contact the nearest Indian embassy, high commission or consulate overseas or the nearest foreigners registration office (FRO) in India to determine proper procedures to follow.        
	This is tantamount to turning the tables on the Indian government.        
	If every American citizen planning a trip to India were to contact Indian missions and seek such advice, these missions would be swamped by enquiries: they are simply not equipped to handle such large-scale queries and do not have helplines for dealing with the public during such exigencies.        
	Nor can any locally recruited clerk, who will inevitably be assigned to man the phone line, be in any position to answer such queries: because ultimately, it will be the whim of the officer at the arrival counter at an airport that will determine whether a visa holder enters India or is sent back from the airport, not any rule set in stone.        
	Besides, Indian consular offices in the US have very limited experience of dealing with the public after it outsourced all visa collection and delivery process to an American company in October 2007.        
	In a severe and undiplomatic indictment of the Indian immigration system, the US embassy in New Delhi has formally warned American citizens that these new visa and registration regulations are being implemented inconsistently and are not finalised.        
	It is understood that separately, the US deputy chief of mission in New Delhi, Steven White, has protested to Gaitri Kumar, joint secretary in charge of the Americas in the ministry of external affairs (MEA), over the inconvenience to Americans at entry points in India.        
	The British high commissioner in New Delhi is also said to have written to the MEA over similar problems affecting British citizens visiting India.        
	If India does not respond to these complaints, it will only be a matter of time before Indians arriving at US and UK airports are put to similar inconvenience.        
	Countries which have self-esteem believe in reciprocity in diplomatic dealings and if India continues to be unreasonable in its dealings with arriving foreigners, it is only natural that foreign governments will implement tit-for-tat policies.        
	At the heart of the current immigration problems at Indias points of entry is a new home ministry rule after the Headley revelations that there should be a gap of at least two months between two visits to the country on a tourist visa.        
	However, according to the Indian embassy in Washington, in case of requirement to (re)visit the country within two months, permission should be sought from the Indian ambassador here. In such cases, registration would be required within 14 days of arrival at the nearest foreigners registration office in India.        
	But according to the US embassy in New Delhi, to mention a case among the many it has recorded, one American in India on a business visa was informed that she would not be allowed to depart India until she had registered with the FRO, even though she had only been in India for seven days and her passport was stamped Registration not required if stay is less than 14 days.

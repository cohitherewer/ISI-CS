          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar March 15: The mystery surrounding Maoist posters spotted in and around Cuttack, Bhubaneswar and Puri has been solved with the arrest of five persons.         
	The accused have been identified as Biswajit Patnaik, Debendra Nayak, Nursingh Mohapatra, Baba Sona and Ganga Moharana. None of the five have a Maoist background and are common criminals.        
	Police also seized two swords, five mobile phones, a country-made pistol and live ammunition from the five persons. The arrests have spelled relief for the public who were on the verge of panic after spotting the posters in and around the town at regular intervals in the past couple of weeks.         
	On February 11, a batch of posters was spotted, threatening citizens of Bhubaneswar, Cuttack and Puri to abstain from Saint Valentines Day or face consequences.         
	Earlier on January 30, similar statements and posters, pasted in the name of CPI(ML) were put up in those town and cities cautioning hoteliers and politicians to stay away from corrupt practices or face the axe.         
	However, the police had questioned the authenticity of those posters.         
	We had to deploy more security in the town areas after the posters were firsts seen. We, however, were not sure that it was a Maoist handiwork and thuse had kept a close watch on the criminal gangs. Finally, we have succeeded in nabbing the persons involved in the mischief, said Puri superintendent of police Asit Panigrahi.         
	The accused have been booked u/s 505, 506, 507, 386, 387, and 34 of the IPC and will be forwarded to judicial custody today, Panigrahi said adding that efforts are on to nab the remaining accused including the mastermind.

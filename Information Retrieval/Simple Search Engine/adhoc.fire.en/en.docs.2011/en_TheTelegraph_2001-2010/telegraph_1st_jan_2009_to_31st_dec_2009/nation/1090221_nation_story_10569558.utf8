The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | MPs move to oust city judge
                                                                                                               MPs move to oust city judge
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       Sen: House move                          
	New Delhi, Feb. 20: Fifty-eight Rajya Sabha MPs today signed a petition seeking impeachment of Calcutta High Court judge Soumitra Sen, saying they had been forced to act because the government was dithering.        
	The initiative was led by Left MPs but the signatories included Congress allies such as the NCPs Tariq Anwar and the RJDs Rajniti Prasad, both of whom slammed the Centres six months of indecision on the matter.        
	Samajwadi Party members, however, did not sign the petition that has been made to Rajya Sabha Chairman Hamid Ansari, ensuring the issue would stay alive when a new government takes over.        
	Lok Sabha MPs from many parties had spoken out passionately yesterday against corruption in the higher judiciary.         
	CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said the Sen petition wasnt moved in the lower House so it wouldnt die out with the expiry of the governments term.        
	The Left stopped at 58 signatures, a CPM leader said, because only 50 are needed to move a notice in the upper House. Under the Judges (Inquiry) Act 1968, a notice moved in the lower House needs the signatures of 100 members.        
	The House resolves to pass the motion for the impeachment of Justice Soumitra Sen of Calcutta High Court on the following two grounds of misconduct, the petition said.        
	The grounds are: alleged misappropriation of large sums of money that the judge had received in his capacity as high court-appointed receiver, and alleged misrepresentation of facts with regard to the misappropriation of money.        
	On August 4 last year, the Chief Justice of India had written to the Prime Minister, recommending the judges removal under Article 217(1), read with Article 124(4). The MPs attached the letter to their petition.        
	Since the Congress did not take action, we have taken the initiative, Yechury told reporters.        
	Law minister H.R. Bharadwaj had yesterday told the Lok Sabha: I am senior to the CJI in age and experience. I will decide on impeachment. But there is no time left in this House.        
	The CPM today repeated its demand for a national judicial commission that will consider judges appointments and deal with judicial misconduct. A collegium of judges now recommends the appointments.

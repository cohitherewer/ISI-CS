                                                                                                               Court order on water crisis
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Feb. 15: Orissa High Courts decision to monitor allotment of water for state industries has brought into focus the issue of present consumption by industries vis--vis requirement of upcoming ones.        
	The courts decision assumes significance as the government has signed 60-odd MoUs to set up steel, aluminium and thermal power projects here and has promised to allot water to all the firms.         
	Official figures indicate that upcoming industries in the state will require 6.22 billion litres of water per day in the next five years. Projections indicate that proposed plants for steel production will require 1.2 billion litres of water per year, five times the total urban water supply in the state, sources mostly from the states 11 rivers.        
	While the Brahmani is already catering to 65 per cent needs of industrial water in Orissa, the states largest river, the Mahanadi, is apparently set to come under critical pressure from upcoming industries. Some of the major industrial projects that would depend on the Mahanadi, include Poscos proposed mega-steel plant near Paradip, Vedanta Alumina Limiteds smelter plant at Jharsuguda and Hindalcos smelter at Sambalpur.        
	While hearing a batch of petitions the high court last week directed the government to file an affidavit on the procedure adopted for granting permission to industries for drawing water. The court was worried over the impending hazards of indiscriminate allotment. The direction came from a three-judge bench of chief justice B.S. Chauhan, Justice Indrajit Mohanty and Justice S.C. Parija, while adjudicating petitions filed by several industrial houses challenging water tax imposed on them by the government. Allotment of water to industries has become an issue with farmers expressing concern that farmland would be deprived of water in coming years.

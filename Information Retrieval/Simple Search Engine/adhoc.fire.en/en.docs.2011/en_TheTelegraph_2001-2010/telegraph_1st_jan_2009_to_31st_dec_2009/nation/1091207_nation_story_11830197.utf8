          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 6: Peeved over premature adjournment of the winter session of the state Assembly, Opposition members today marched to Raj Bhavan to lodge their protest against the undemocratic and unconstitutional act of the Naveen Patnaik government.        
	Led by leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh, the Congress and BJP legislators met Governor M.C. Bhandare and urged him not to prorogue the Assembly and direct the government to summon the session for the rest of the days.        
	They pointed out that the winter session, which was scheduled to continue till December 19, was adjourned sine die abruptly yesterday, with 11 working days left, without consulting the Opposition.        
	Describing the government as escapist, the Opposition members alleged that the ruling BJD by virtue of its brute majority, curtailed the sitting of the state, which is required to meet for at least 60 days in a year. The government ran away from the House as it was scared to face the Opposition attack in the wake of the mining scam, alleged Singh.         
	The government has betrayed the people of the state as well as the members of Opposition by curtailing the sitting days, he said, seeking the governors intervention.         
	The agitated Opposition members have been sitting in dharna in the Well of the Assembly since last evening in protest against autocratic approach of the government and the partisan behaviour of the Speaker.         
	The Leader of Opposition said the protest would continue round-the-clock till December 19, the date till the session was to last.        
	This was the third instance during Naveens rule that the Assembly was adjourned sine die abruptly. Earlier in 2005 and 2007, the House had been adjourned abruptly, said the Opposition members.

	Ranchi/Dumka, April 4: JMM chief Shibu Sorens eldest son stunned his own party by filing his nomination for the Godda seat, meant for ally Congress according to a seat-sharing deal, forcing his father to fax a message from Delhi clarifying Durga wasnt a party nominee.        
	Soren had yesterday left Durga and younger sibling Hemant in charge of the JMMs campaign as he travelled to Delhi for treatment.         
	Should he choose to remain in the fray, Durga  he has claimed the party symbol  would be locking horns with sitting Congress MP Furkan Ansari and the BJPs Nishi Kant Dubey.         
	In his fax to the Godda deputy commissioner, which listed the names of all JMM candidates, Soren asked the Election Commission to take action against Durga. As the president of JMM, I have signed form A and B in respect of seven candidates. Any candidate producing form A and B apart from those in the above mentioned (constituencies) may be treated as forged, Soren said.

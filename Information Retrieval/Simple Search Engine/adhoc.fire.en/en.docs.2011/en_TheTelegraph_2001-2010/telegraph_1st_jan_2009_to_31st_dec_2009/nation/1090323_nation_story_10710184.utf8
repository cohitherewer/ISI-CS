The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | EC turns Varun a millstone for BJP
                                                                                                               EC turns Varun a millstone for BJP
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                          Varun: What now?                                  
	New Delhi, March 22: The Election Commission tonight held Varun Gandhi guilty of violating the poll code with his anti-Muslim speeches and advised the BJP, or any other political party, not to give him a ticket to the Lok Sabha in an unprecedented advisory that threatens to blow off his electoral debut.        
	The Election Commission strongly condemns and censures respondent, Feroze Varun Gandhi, an order passed unanimously by the three-member panel said.        
	The poll panels crackdown came after it concluded that the tapes of Varuns inflammatory and communal speech in Pilibhit had not been doctored and found the young BJP leaders response to its showcause unsatisfactory.        
	Varuns controversial speech, aired on news channels, showed him making blatantly communal and inflammatory remarks.        
	Although Varun had claimed that the allegations against him were unsubstantiated and had denied them, he had neither specifically accepted nor rejected the contents of the speeches and the inflammatory and derogatory tone, tenor and language used in the two speeches, the panel said.        
	The commission said that it had carefully gone through the reports and viewed the video CD of the speeches. The speeches contained highly derogatory references and seriously provocative language of a wholly unacceptable nature against a certain community, a statement said.        
	The BJP reacted cautiously. We have taken cognisance of the advice by the commission but we cannot react unless we have seen and studied the written order, said BJP leader Balbir Punj. The commission cannot on paper decide who should or should not get the party ticket, but we are considering the issue in the light of its views.         
	If Varun is finally dumped by the party, it will not be out of conviction as the dominant view among senior leaders and workers is that candidates cannot be changed for what they say in the heat of electioneering. Some leaders feel that eliminating Varun at this stage was not politically desirable as the tenor of his speeches had electrified the hardcore Sangh Parivar workers.         
	One BJP leader told The Telegraph that the commissions view was in the form of an advisory and was not legally binding.        
	The commission virtually conceded this in its statement. The panel said it was conscious of its limitations under the law that it could not disqualify Varun and debar him from contesting elections unless he was convicted or held guilty by a court after proceedings. Therefore, it was only strongly condemning and censuring him.        
	But the commission quoted the BJP itself to hammer home its recommendation. This (denial of a ticket) will be fully in keeping with the assertion of the party that it completely disagrees, disassociates, and disapproves the views of Feroze Varun Gandhi and that the party stands by the model code of conduct in its entirety, the panel said.        
	Further observations in the statement will add to the BJPs discomfiture and the efforts of L.K. Advani to project himself as a moderate if the party continues to stick by Varun.        
	Any sponsorship of his candidature by the BJP, or any other political party at this election, would be perceived as endorsing his unpardonable acts of inciting violence and creating feelings of enmity and hatred between different classes of citizens of India, destroying the social, democratic and plural fabric of the country, as enshrined in the Constitution which all political parties have undertaken to uphold, it said.        
	Should the BJP decide to ignore the commissions recommendation, the matter may end up in court.                    WITH INPUTS FROM SANJAY K. JHA

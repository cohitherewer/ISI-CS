          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 21: The human resource development ministry is contemplating a ban on teacher training through distance education, a move that may hit expansion efforts of the Centres own open university.        
	An HRD ministry-appointed panel of experts has suggested that distance training be banned for aspiring teachers, making classroom teaching mandatory.        
	The panel has argued that the trend of pre-service education through distance learning is harming the quality of teachers entering the profession as they have not been practically tested by trainers.        
	 The move may, however, hurt the Indira Gandhi National Open University, which in recent months has aggressively pushed its teacher-training programmes through distance education.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Caged no more                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 31: Two accused in the sensational Marmoset theft case from Calcuttas Alipore zoo in September have confessed to having stolen a pair of macaws from Nandankanan Zoological Park here in July.        
	Rajesh Singh and Raj Saikia, arrested by Calcutta police in September for stealing rare Marmoset monkeys from Alipore zoo, were brought in remand by the Orissa police crime branch to Nandankanan yesterday.        
	During interrogation, the duo admitted that they entered the zoo on July 25 evening after a daylong planning.        
	The duo, who stayed at a city hotel, hired a guide for a visit to the zoo. After they saw the macaws, they asked the guide to leave and planned to steal the pair, crime branch sources said.        
	However, the duo denied taking help of any zoo animal keeper to execute the plan.        
	They confessed to have entered the zoo at 9pm and broke open the lock of the enclosure where the two macaw pairs were kept. They then captured the macaws using a wet towel and came out of the zoo. They spent the night by the roadside pretending to be asleep, crime branch sources revealed.         
	At the break of dawn, they hired an autorickshaw and went to the bus stand from where they boarded a bus to Raipur on way to Nagpur where the birds were handed over to Vivian Sasmin, the kingpin of the racket. They were paid Rs 55,000 for the birds.        
	Vivian is still absconding.        
	The sleuths, along with the two accused, visited the hotel where they had stayed and the shop from where they bought cages.

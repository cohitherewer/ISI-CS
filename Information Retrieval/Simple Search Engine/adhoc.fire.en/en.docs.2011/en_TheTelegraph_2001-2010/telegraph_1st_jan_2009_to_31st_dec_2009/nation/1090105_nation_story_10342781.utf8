	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 4: Tension ran high among residents of Bisamcuttack town of Raygada district this morning after Maoist posters had been spotted at several locations of the area demanding immediate release of two engineering college officials arrested recently.        
	The two private engineering college staff were arrested on December 30 for allegedly trying to donate about Rs 12 lakh to the Maoists. The rebels have also demanded the entire cash to be returned.         
	The two officials  college secretary Chandradhwaja Panda and administrative officer Jagannath Rao  were arrested while they were on way to neighbouring Gajapati district with the cash in a jeep.        
	Investigations are on to ascertain links between the officials of the college and the Naxalites.         
	The posters also demanded stern action against M2, supposedly a new extremist outfit. The outfit, reportedly grown after a split in the maoist group, had circulated leaflets calling for a bandh today at riot hit Kandhamal.         
	The 12-hour bandh called by the outfit was partially successful.

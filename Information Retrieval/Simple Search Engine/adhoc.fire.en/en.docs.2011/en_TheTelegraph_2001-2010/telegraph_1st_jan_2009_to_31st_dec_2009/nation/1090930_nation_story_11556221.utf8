The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Kalawati pulls out, not first son rival 
                                                                                                               Kalawati pulls out, not first son rival 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              Kalawati and (right) Babytai Bais, the new candidate				                                 
	Mumbai, Sept. 29: Vidarbha farm widow Kalawati Bandurkar has withdrawn her candidature but the Congress minister challenging President Pratibha Patils son is remaining in the fray.        
	Instead of Kalawati  who shot into the limelight after Rahul Gandhi referred to her plight  another widow, Babytai Bais, from Hiwara village in Yavatmal will contest as the official candidate for Sharad Joshis Swantantra Bharat Party, supported by the Vidarbha Jan Andolan Samiti (VJAS), in the October 13 elections.        
	Kalawati had filed her nomination from the Wani Assembly constituency, a traditional Congress bastion breached in 2004 by the Shiv Sena.         
	Kalawatis candidature had surprised Bindeshwar Pathak of Sulabh International which had declared support for her family for 20 years by providing her Rs 25,000 a month accruing as interest on a Rs 30-lakh fixed deposit in her name. Sulabh also paid her Rs 6 lakh for 2008-09 and 2009-10. The mother of nine had used some of this money to construct a house.        
	Pathak had advised Kalawati to refrain from joining politics and turn to social work if she wished to help other widows and farmers.         
	Perhaps apprehending that she might lose the financial help, Kalawati withdrew her candidature today  the last day for doing so. Her son-in law threatened that he would commit suicide if she contests, claimed Kishore Tiwari of the VJAS.        
	Her replacement, Bais, lost her husband in 2007 when he committed suicide in the face of debt run up while tending his four-acre farm. She has two children.        
	On January 26, 2008, Bais had travelled to New Delhi and staged a protest outside the Prime Ministers house to highlight the agrarian crisis that has killed over 5,000 cotton farmers in Vidarbha. Bais will contest on the symbol of a candle that stands for hope and light and will be supported by 200 widows, Tiwari said.        
	With all major political parties facing the problem of rebel candidates, their leaders had been trying to persuade the dissidents to withdraw. Promises of rehabilitation, tacit pressure and threats of disciplinary action prompted over a dozen candidates to withdraw.        
	Prominent among those who did not withdraw includes the Congress minister of state for finance, Sunil Deshmukh. He is contesting as an Independent against the official Congress candidate Rajendra Shekhawat, son of President Patil, from Amravati.         
	If the leadership fails to strike an eleventh-hour deal and dissuade Deshmukh, a two-time MLA from Amravati, from campaigning, the contest is expected to be close.

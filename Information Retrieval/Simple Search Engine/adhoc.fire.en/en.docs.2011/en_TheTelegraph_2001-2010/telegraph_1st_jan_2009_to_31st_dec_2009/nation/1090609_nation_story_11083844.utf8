The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cautious Cong sees no friction
                                                                                                               Cautious Cong sees no friction
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 8: The Congresss reaction to the arrest of NCP MP Padamsinh Patil was muted in contrast to the grandstanding against Sharad Pawar and company Maharashtra leaders had indulged in over the past few days.         
	Vilasrao Deshmukh and Prithviraj Chavan have been told not to make statements that might rile the NCP because the Congress leadership was still not inclined to replicate Rahul Gandhis ekla chalo (go solo) line in Maharashtra, where elections are due in a few months.        
	Deshmukh and Chavan too had said the Congress should fight the Assembly polls on its own. They argued that the NCPs raison detre did not exist because the issue it was founded on  Sonia Gandhis foreign origin  was defunct and Pawars ambition to become the Prime Minister had been quashed by the 2009 verdict. The NCP should merge with the Grand Old Party, the leaders felt.         
	Patils arrest is an internal matter of the NCP. There is no cause of friction between the Congress and the NCP. Pawar and Praful Patel (senior NCP minister) have said the law will take its course, said party spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed.        
	Despite the Congresss endeavour to underplay Patils arrest, sources admitted that most NCP workers were convinced the case was politically instigated.         
	Unfortunately, a perception has travelled across the state that the CBI was used to fix Patil to teach Pawar a lesson, a Maharashtra MP said.

                                                                                                               Amarnath act relief
                            
	Srinagar, Feb. 20: The Jammu and Kashmir government has revoked detention orders under the Public Safety Act of some of those who took part in the Amarnath land agitation, giving in to pressure from separatists and Hindu hardliners.        
	Dinesh Bharti, who was accused of inciting passions during the land protests last year, and separatist leader Nayeem Khan are among the 21 whose detention order has been revoked.         
	The act allows detention for up to two years without trial.        
	The government had charged two pro-Amarnath protesters and dozens from the rival camp under the law. All of them except Bharti had been detained.

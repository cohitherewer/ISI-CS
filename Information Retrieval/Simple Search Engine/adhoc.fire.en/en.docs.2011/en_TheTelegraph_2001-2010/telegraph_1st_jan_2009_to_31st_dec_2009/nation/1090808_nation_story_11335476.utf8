The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | One flu patient for 10 infected: Study 
                                                                                                               One flu patient for 10 infected: Study 
  - Expert allays fears about virulence, others doubtful         G.S. MUDUR                           A student in Pune on Friday. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, Aug. 7: Only one in 10 persons infected with the pandemic H1N1 virus in India develops flu symptoms, an early investigation of its disease-causing potential in the country has suggested, a senior medical researcher said today.         
	The study conducted by a government laboratory has hinted that less than 10 per cent of a group of children who had got infected had developed the disease, Vishwa Mohan Katoch, head of the Indian Council of Medical Research, said.         
	Katoch declined to reveal details of the findings because they have not been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal. This is still preliminary, emerging data, but it tells us that people need not panic, he said.         
	The study, he said, involved a few hundred children below the age of 14  an age group considered specially vulnerable to the virus. Among Indias 615 confirmed H1N1 cases, 129 are children between 10 and 14.         
	Katoch said the study had confirmed the H1N1 virus has high transmissibility  it moves easily from person to person  but the proportion of people who develop any kind of symptoms, even mild symptoms, was less than 10 per cent. The proportion who develop serious symptoms was even smaller, less than 0.1 per cent, he said.         
	But a medical expert not involved in the study said the findings were surprising. A one-to-10 ratio of clinical cases (infected people with symptoms) to sub-clinical cases (infected people without symptoms) in influenza is unusual  this would need to be validated, said the infectious diseases expert who requested anonymity.         
	Studies of seasonal (non-H1N1) influenza in Europe indicate that about 67 per cent of infected people develop the disease  in other words, 33 per cent remain without symptoms.         
	French researchers who investigated an outbreak of H1N1 in a school in Toulouse, southern France, found high attack (transmission) rates and high proportion of infection. Their study, published last month in the journal Eurosurveillance, had found that among 20 cases, only three did not show symptoms.        
	Nod to private labs         
	The health ministry has said private laboratories are free to offer testing for H1N1 provided they accredit themselves with government reference laboratories and take adequate precautions.         
	Private laboratories would have to equip themselves with the right reagents for the (H1N1) test and establish safety levels required for testing, Naresh Dayal, health secretary, said.         
	Government reference labs would verify and accredit the private labs, he said, outlining the steps the ministry was initiating to tackle a possible flare-up of the pandemic. The test is currently available only in 18 government laboratories. The test which costs about Rs 10,000 is available free at government hospitals.         
	But private laboratories could charge for it.

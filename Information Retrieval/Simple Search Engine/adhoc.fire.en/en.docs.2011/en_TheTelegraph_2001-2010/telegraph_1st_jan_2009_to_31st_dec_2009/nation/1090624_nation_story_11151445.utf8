	Lalgarh, June 23: Troops from an India Reserve Battalion deployed here were relieved from four days of constant duty only after they threatened to rebel, indicating just how much of a toll the operations here are taking on security forces even before they have waded into what are believed to be Maoist strongholds.        
	On the first day, we were caught in the firing at Piarkhuli, one of the soldiers said after the company was redeployed to Pingboni to the north of Lalgarh. The IRB company was inducted from the battalion headquarters at Durgapur. It was first assigned to do duty on the east-west axis to Lalgarh through Pirakata.        
	The uniform worn by the soldier is standard army fatigues. But the thick textile is most unsuited to the weather here. Temperature in West Midnapore is easily over 45 degrees Celsius and humidity is in the nineties.        
	We were wearing the same clothes for four days, the soldier said. And at night, we slept on the road after Pirakata.        
	The soldiers also wear bullet-proof vests and their standard issue weapon is the Insas rifle that weighs more than 5kg. Marching with that kind of gear in this weather and keeping all the senses alert in the forests adds stress to the heat.        
	This is what the personnel of the BSF, the CRPF and some units of the Bengal armed police wear and carry too. One CRPF jawan died of heat stroke during the march from Bhimpur to Lalgarh through the Jhitka forest last week.        
	Since the forces reached the police station here three days back, there has been no further advance. Fear of landmines on the roads has combined with fatigue to delay the push. It is likely that with about 10 additional companies of central forces coming in, probably from tomorrow, the advance will be renewed.        
	For the foot soldiers, the break ensures some amount of rest. But already they are looking for replenishments that will take them out of here.        
	In Lalgarhs primary health centre, at least seven to eight security personnel are in bed because the heat has got the better of them. The only casualties that helicopters have evacuated are security personnel who suffered heat stroke.        
	The IRB trooper, now on sentry duty  which is better than going on long patrols  said he and his mates stuffed their pockets with dry fruit on their way from Durgapur. When they tried buying some food at Pirakata, there wasnt much in the shop. On the third day, they managed to find some khichdi. The battalions commanding officer has stayed back in Durgapur, he said.        
	The IRB is raised by state governments with central assistance, particularly in states where Maoists are active. The Union home ministry sanctions funds to raise the battalions under security-related expenditure.        
	Bengals 1 IRB, however, was close to mutiny in the middle of an operation because of faulty planning.         
	The Bengal government has clearly gone into the operations in Lalgarh without adequate preparation. As soon as the Centre accepted its request for central forces, it began the operations. But now, increasingly, the commanders are feeling the need for a back-up.        
	The most important support that is needed is a field hospital system, where doctors and paramedics accompany the forces.         
	Since the security forces are aware that they are entering hostile terrain, there is little they can expect by way of support from the villagers. In any case, the villagers are too poor to support them. Even in areas through which the security forces have passed, villagers do not conceal or disguise their dislike of the police.

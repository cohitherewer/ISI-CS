          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                     
	New Delhi, Jan. 24: Defence minister A.K. Antony gets to play Prime Minister for Republic Day in the absence of Manmohan Singh, now recuperating from a heart surgery.         
	Antony will perform the duties of the Prime Minister for the Republic Day ceremonies, according to protocol changes announced by the government today. Vice-President Hamid Ansari will give away the bravery awards.         
	Foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee, the No. 2 in the cabinet, will lead the delegation-level talks with the Kazakh President.         
	The Republic Day parade is the responsibility of the defence ministry. These are the functions of the defence ministry and it is normal for the defence minister to perform the role in the absence of the Prime Minister, ministry spokesperson Sitanshu Kar said.        
	Unlike the Independence Day ceremonies on August 15 each year, the Republic Day events are centred around the President and the chief guest. The Prime Minister is not scheduled to make a speech, for instance, on Republic Day but for August 15, he would be expected to give a speech from the Red Fort. Antonys role, therefore, will be a limited one for protocol purposes only.         
	Antony will receive President Pratibha Patil and the President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev  the chief guest at this years Republic Day parade  at Rajghat in the morning. He will lay a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldiers at India Gate and will also receive Patil and Nazarbayev at the saluting dais on Rajpath just before the parade begins.         
	On January 28, Antony will address a rally of the National Cadet Corps, an annual event presided over by the Prime Minister. He will also host a reception for the cultural participants of the Republic Day parade at Teen Murti Bhavan in the evening.         
	Apart from the defence ministry programmes, Mukherjee has been stepping in for the Prime Minister. He received Nazarbayev at a reception in Rashtrapati Bhavan today.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | B after A? BJP worried
                                                                                                               B after A? BJP worried
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 21: Some in the BJP are concerned that all the probable successors to L.K. Advani as leader of the Lok Sabha Opposition are Brahmins.        
	The party that, post-Mandal, loved to showcase its rainbow hierarchy of upper and lower caste leaders realises it can no longer boast of being an architect of social engineering.        
	Sushma Swaraj, the front-runner in the succession race, is a Brahmin. So is Murli Manohar Joshi, her main rival.        
	The B factor would not have been be a talking point had Arun Jaitley not been appointed leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha. Jaitley is a Brahmin, though not many know this even in the BJP.        
	Unless Jaitley is appointed BJP president and thus forfeits his House post, sources said, it may not be easy to promote Sushma or Joshi.        
	Given the harsh truth that we no longer have a committed following within any caste, it might not help in the long run to have so many Brahmin faces, a source said.        
	If a consensus on Sushma or Joshi eludes the party, those who may stand an outside chance are Ananth Kumar, Sumitra Mahajan, Kailash Joshi and Harin Pathak. All of them are Brahmins.        
	The BJP once had the highest number of Dalit, backward and intermediate caste MPs, thanks to its success in the heartland. As the party lost its grip over Uttar Pradesh and became the Janata Dal (United)s junior partner in Bihar, its caste embrace shrank.        
	Sources said that if caste equations became a criterion, the party could consider Gopinath Munde, a backward caste leader from Maharashtra, as Advanis successor. Karia Munda, one of the BJPs best-known tribal leaders, has already been appointed Deputy Speaker.        
	The catch is, if the BJP-Shiv Sena lose in Maharashtra, Munde could be in trouble because he is micro-managing the elections.        
	For now, Joshi, 75, is positioning himself for battle despite a clear indication from the RSS that it wants a young leader in the post. Joshi is not seen as the most accessible senior even to the BJPs own MPs  as leader of the Opposition he would be expected to network with MPs from other parties too.        
	Joshis only advantage is that the RSS wants to stop Advani from continuing to exercise his influence  which he may do through Sushma, his protg. Joshi, on the other hand, has been Advanis opponent.        
	Joshis backers are spreading the word that Sushma has informed Sangh leaders she would have no problem being his deputy. Sushma could not be contacted.

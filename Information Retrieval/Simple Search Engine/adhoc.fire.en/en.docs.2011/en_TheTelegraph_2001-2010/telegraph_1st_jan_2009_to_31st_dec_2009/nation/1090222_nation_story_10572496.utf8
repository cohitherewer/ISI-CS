The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mamata call for alliance
                                                                                                               Mamata call for alliance

	Feb. 21: Mamata Banerjee today welcomed the Congresss withdrawal of a bypoll candidate in favour of the Trinamul Congress and stressed that both parties should work to ensure an alliance before the Lok Sabha polls.        
	State Congress president Pranab Mukherjee, though, said he would share the dais with the chief minister at a project launch tomorrow  something Mamata has expressly asked him not to do for the sake of the proposed alliance.        
	After returning to Calcutta from Jangipur, where he made the comment, Mukherjee, however, complained of uneasiness tonight. Following an ECG, his doctor blamed the discomfort on acidity and exhaustion and advised rest.        
	Mamata, kicking off party candidate Madan Mitras campaign in Bishnupur, said: I welcome the Congress initiative to withdraw its candidate for this (Bishnupur West) Assembly bypoll. We should now try to ensure that a cohesive alliance emerges ahead of the Lok Sabha polls to oust the CPM from Bengal.        
	This is the time to work cohesively. It has to be remembered that our political adversary is the CPM, whose days are numbered.        
	Mamtazuddin Gazi, the Congress candidate who pulled out at the central leaderships behest, shared the platform with Mamata but senior state Congress leaders were absent although some had been expected.        
	Yesterday, Mamata had said she was ready for talks with the Congress but Pranabda should stop praising the CPM all the time.        
	She had added: Its unfair to unveil projects with elections around the corner. I appeal to Pranabda not to share the dais with the chief minister.        
	But Mukherjee, speaking in his constituency Jangipur in Murshidabad, said he would be by Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees side when he inaugurates the East West Metro project in Salt Lake tomorrow.        
	Why should I not (be there)? This is a development project that would help the people of Calcutta. One should not bring narrow politics into it, the foreign minister said.        
	I am extending this co-operating for the sake of the state, not for any party. If after the 2011 Assembly polls Mamata becomes chief minister, I would extend the same gesture if I happen to be around at that time.        
	In what may sound to many ears like a sermon on the Nano fiasco, he said: I am trying to be of help to the people of Bengal who are represented by the government. I am not helping any political party in particular. There is a distinction between the two, which must be understood.        
	In Bishnupur, Gazi said he had opted out at the behest of Sonia Gandhi, who wants an alliance with Trinamul, not just for the Bishnupur bypoll but for the Lok Sabha and 2011 Assembly polls too.

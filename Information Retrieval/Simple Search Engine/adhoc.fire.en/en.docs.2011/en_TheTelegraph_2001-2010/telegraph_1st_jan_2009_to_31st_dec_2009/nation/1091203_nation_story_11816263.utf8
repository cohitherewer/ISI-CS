The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Glare on IIM hurry for online test
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Glare on IIM hurry for online test
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 2: The Indian Institutes of Management ignored repeated concerns raised by some of their own faculty involved in computerising the Common Admission Test (CAT) that the IIMs were inadequately prepared for the shift this year, authoritative sources said.        
	Suggestions to postpone the move from a pen-and-paper CAT to a computerised test by a year were ignored, four sources closely associated with the preparation for the exam independently confirmed to The Telegraph.        
	The concerns were raised at meetings of three different committees of faculty and institute administrators set up by the IIMs to prepare for the computerised test and to advise organisers, the sources said.        
	The ignored concerns left many faculty representatives on these three committees under the impression that a few of the directors were in an inexplicable hurry to risk computerising the test, the sources said.        
	The director of at least one IIM was among those who expressed concerns over whether the institutes were ready for the computerised test this year, the sources said. This director was later dissuaded from breaking ranks with the others, they said.        
	One representative of IIM Calcutta even threatened to resign from a committee preparing for the computerised exam alleging that concerns over the rush to computerise the test were not being taken seriously, the sources said. This representative, too, was cajoled into withdrawing his threat, the sources said.        
	But the directors of the seven IIMs, who had signed an agreement with US-based testing service provider Prometric in April this year, decided against any postponement of the test, it is learnt.        
	The directors are now  as reported by this newspaper in Wednesdays edition  considering a proposal to scrap the computerised CAT and re-conduct a pen-and-paper test to select students this year.        
	But thousands of candidates already find themselves in the lurch after technical glitches prevented them from taking the computerised CAT  tried for the first time this year  at their slotted time.        
	IIM Ahmedabad director Samir Barua refused to comment on the concerns and suggestions that were ignored in the run-up to the computerised test by those preparing for the format shift.        
	There may have been issues. But all I will say is that all seven IIM directors signed the agreement with Prometric. Beyond that, I will not comment. It is none of your business, Barua said, before disconnecting the call.        
	The ignored concerns and the suggestions mostly revolved around allowing the IIMs greater time to test the new examination software better under stress conditions, the sources said.        
	But some of the concerns also pertained to fears over the technology and service infrastructure available with Prometric outside Indias metros, they said.        
	The inability of the testing software to succeed  in an actual test scenario  on hardware of non-uniform standards is emerging as the prime reason for the glitches that have plagued the online CAT.        
	Concerns were also raised about the nature of the $40-million contract with Prometric for a five-year period. There was a proposal that we should sign a shorter contract with Prometric. A five-year contract binds us to Prometric as the testing service provider even if it messes up, a source said.        
	CAT convener, professor Satish Deodhar of IIM Ahmedabad, however, argued that mock tests were conducted at each test centre ahead of the actual examination, which started last Saturday. I cannot comment on whether we should have waited another year for more tests... that decision was taken by the directors. But once I was given charge of conducting the computerised test this year, we certainly tried our best, Deodhar said.

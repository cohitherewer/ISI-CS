The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | N-plan ready before PM visit 
                                                                                                               N-plan ready before PM visit 
                            
	Mumbai, Oct. 16 (PTI): India has notified a plan under which 14 of its 22 reactors will be placed under the safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency by 2014.        
	The move comes over a month before the Prime Ministers US visit where a priority will be to iron out the creases for implementation of the landmark civil nuclear co-operation agreement.        
	The formalities of notifying the plan, called the separation plan, were completed last night. It is seen as a crucial step in paving the way for the implementation of the agreement, sources in the atomic energy department said.         
	The notification came almost 14 months after the 35-member IAEA board cleared the India-specific safeguards agreement.         
	The notification is expected to help in the ongoing negotiations, said to be at an advanced stage, for the reprocessing accord.         
	India and the US are keen to firm it up during Manmohan Singhs trip beginning November 23.         
	The safeguards agreement, or the umbrella agreement, approved by the IAEA last August can now come into force. The agreement separates Indias civilian and strategic nuclear facilities.         
	The separation plan, which was announced during President George W. Bushs visit to India in March 2006, required India to put the 14 reactors under IAEA safeguards in a phased manner.         
	In Vienna last week, officials from the two sides completed the second round of consultations on the arrangements and procedures agreement to reprocess spent nuclear fuel of US origin.        
	Clinching the agreement on reprocessing is critical to commercial nuclear co-operation and for operationalisation of the nuclear deal, department sources said.        
	Under the 123 Agreement with the US, India is required to establish a new national facility dedicated to reprocessing nuclear material under the IAEAs safeguards.        
	Under the notified plan, two indigenously built units of the 220MW Rajasthan Atomic Power Station have been formally brought under the safeguards agreement.

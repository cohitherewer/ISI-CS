          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, June 18: A little-known bandit staved off around 500 policemen for over 50 hours in Chitrakoot district of Uttar Pradesh before falling to bullets, raising questions about the ability of crack security forces to deal with such crises.        
	The gun battle, which began around noon on Tuesday, ended at 1.20pm today when Ghanshyam Kewat, who took up position in a house in a forested area, was finally mowed down.         
	The lone dacoit, who had unleashed a reign of terror in the region, killed four policemen and left seven wounded in the encounter at Jamoli village, 250km from Lucknow.        
	Kewat, 42, a former member of dreaded bandit Daduas gang, formed his own group after breaking off in 2006 from his mentor, who was gunned down a year later.        
	Kewat battled over 500 policemen drawn from crack squads like the Special Task Force and the Special Operations Group, trained to deal with terrorists and equipped with sophisticated automatic and semi-automatic weapons, assault rifles and bulletproof vests.        
	Kewats arsenal included grenades and self-loading rifles.         
	Uttar Pradesh director-general of police Vikram Singh admitted that Kewat was alone in the house in which he remained holed up for two days.         
	As explanation, Singh proffered what the administration in Bengal has been saying about its inaction until today over Lalgarh.        
	The police faced a hostile terrain and were keen on avoiding civilian casualty, the Singh said. But our men battled it out in cornering the dacoit and ending his reign of terror.

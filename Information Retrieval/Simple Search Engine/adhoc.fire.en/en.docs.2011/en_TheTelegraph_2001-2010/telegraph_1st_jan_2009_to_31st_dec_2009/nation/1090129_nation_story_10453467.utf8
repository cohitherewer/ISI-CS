The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Samajwadi hardens seat-share stand
                                                                                                               Samajwadi hardens seat-share stand
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 28: The birthday wish hasnt softened Amar Singh, not one bit.        
	Armed with Kalyan Singhs support, the Samajwadi Party stiffened a little today before getting into the final lap of seat adjustments with the Congress.        
	Party general secretary Amar announced candidates for two more seats, taking the number to 53. As the Congress hopes to contest 25 seats in Uttar Pradesh, sources said the scope to bargain was getting narrower every day, especially with Kalyan also expecting close to half-a-dozen seats.        
	Amars announcement came not long after the Congresss first family sent him birthday greetings last night. Earlier in the day, Amar had told TV channels they hadnt wished him.        
	The Samajwadis have decided to field Premkumari Parihar from Fatehpur Sikri, where the Congress was planning a ticket for MP Raj Babbar who quit Amars party.        
	The Samajwadis have clarified that no sitting MPs seat would be offered to the Congress. With former BJP leader Kalyan on their side, sources said the Samajwadis were confident they would do better even at the risk of alienating the secular voter. Kalyan was chief minister when Babri Masjid was razed in December 1992.         
	Ash ruled out        
	I want her to stay away from even the R of rajniti (politics), Amar told reporters, when asked if daughter-in-law Aishwarya Rai Bachchan would campaign for the Samajwadis.

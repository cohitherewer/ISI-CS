	Patna, Dec. 18: The Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) today dragged the battle against Nitish Kumar from the streets and the House to the court, while its chief Ram Vilas Paswan demanded dismissal of the chief minister for throttling democratic protests in the state.        
	The Nitish government should be dismissed immediately, Paswan said, adding: The police perpetrated mayhem on the LJP cadres who had been protesting against the government in a democratic fashion. Nitish has turned dictatorial.        
	LJP MLA Pashupatinath Paras lodged a case of attempt to murder against city superintendent of police, deputy superintendent of police and the officer in charge of Kotwali police station, Manu Maharaj, Sailesh Sinha and Anuj Kumar, respectively, in connection with yesterdays lathicharge and injury to party workers.         
	The case was lodged in the court of Patna chief judicial magistrate.        
	While the LJP-RJD combine stalled proceedings in the state legislature on the second day today, Paras presented party leaders  injured in the police action yesterday  before the media.        
	Party leader Ramlakhan Ram had sustained head injury, while Paras and Achyutanand had got their hands fractured. Achyutanand had also sustained head injuries. The injured leaders had appeared in bandage and plasters. The LJP has decided to observe black day tomorrow against the police barbarity.        
	Earlier, as soon as the two Houses of the state legislature assembled, the Opposition created uproar and stormed into the well demanding adjournment motion against police action on the LJP workers. Speaker Udainarayan Choudhary adjourned it.                     
	But he eventually adjourned the House for the day when the Opposition members created ruckus time and again on the issue and refused his plea to maintain order.        
	The LJP has been carrying out a battle against the Mahadalit Commission formed by the Nitish government on the plea that the chief minister was drying drive a wedge in the Dalit society for political gains.

	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 21: Three forest offices in Sundergarh district were blown up by Maoists within a span of less than three hours last afternoon.        
	A group of 40 armed rebels, including women cadre, hijacked a Gurundia-bound passenger bus near Karau Bahal village, around 555km from here. They asked the passengers to get down and surrender their mobile phones.         
	This over, they asked the driver to take them towards the Bonai forest division, bordering Jharkhand. While the staff scurried for cover, the extremists blew up the Tamra range office and a training centre at nearby Gurundia block office around 5.30pm.        
	Following this, they directed the driver to take them to Panposh forest division where they blew up the Birda forest beat house under the Bramhani Tarang police limit around 8.30pm. The rebels then disappeared into the forests leaving behind the bus and cellphones but they took a generator set from the beat house.         
	The places of target were located on the outskirts of Rourkela. No one has been injured in the incident, Rourkela superintendent of police Diptesh Patttnaik confirmed.

                                                                                                               Plea seeks bar on   IPL shift
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Jaipur, March 26: A public interest petition has been filed to restrain the organisers of the Indian Premier League (IPL) from shifting the tournament to South Africa.        
	The petition, filed in Rajasthan High Court on Tuesday and scheduled to come up for hearing on March 30, said the leagues second edition had been shifted merely on fear of terror attacks rather than concrete proof.         
	Rameshwar Nirvan, president of the All India Karate Federation, and fellow Jaipur resident Krishna Murari Lal Asthana said shifting the tournament had hurt Indias global standing by sending the message that it cannot tackle terror threats.

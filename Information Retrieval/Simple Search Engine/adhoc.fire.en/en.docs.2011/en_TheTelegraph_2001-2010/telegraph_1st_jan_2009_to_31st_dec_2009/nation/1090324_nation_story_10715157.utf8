The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Real fear in Mulayam yard
                                                                                                               Real fear in Mulayam yard
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, March 23: A cabinet minister from the south compared the Congresss desire to regain ground in the Hindi heartland to the pining of Muslims for the Golden Age of the Ottoman and Persian empires or the fond hope of Tamil Brahmins for the return of Vedic rule in Tamil Nadu.        
	The Congress does not have a blind social base in Uttar Pradesh or Bihar of the kind Mayavati or Lalu Prasad has. Yet, each time these states crop up in internal discussions, their leaders speak of an abstraction called izzat (self-respect). They are not reconciled to the ornamental position the Congress is fated to occupy in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, the minister said.        
	He was asked why the Congress didnt go all out to cement alliances with Mulayam Singh Yadav, Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan.        
	But nostalgia was not the only impulse dictating the Congresss changed approach towards its partners. Its leaders spoke of a real fear of the party going the Tamil Nadu way in the heartland, of being forever relegated to hanging on to the Mulayams, Mayavatis and Lalus for survival.        
	The Congress had its last government in Chennai in 1967, headed by M. Bhaktavatsalam, the grandfather of its spokesperson Jayanthi Natarajan, who ironically depends on one of the Dravida formations to get elected not to the Lok Sabha but the Rajya Sabha.        
	The partys upper caste leaders, predominantly Brahmins from the heartland, conjured up the Tamil Nadu ghost when they advised Sonia Gandhi to rethink her strategy on Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.         
	Sonia has learnt the lesson that Brahmins and Muslims, who were the Congresss staples, are incapable of being launchers (for its revival) or clinchers. The stagnant seniors surrounding 10 Janpath are unwilling to learn this. The problem is because of her instinct for the middle ground, she goes for the established views in the Congress, the minister said.        
	An Uttar Pradesh leader explained the anti-alliance stand: In an election, every party fights to get a majority. We are doing this. Others are fighting for a third front coalition. Our endeavour is to give a strong government to run the country because coalitions force us to take undesirable decisions.        
	Another from Madhya Pradesh suggested the Congress could even do a repeat of 1989, when Rajiv Gandhi sat in the Opposition despite his party being the single largest. After May 16, all options will be open, he said.        
	However, the pragmatists acknowledged that little attempt had been made to resurrect the party in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in the past 20 years that it has been out of power.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | 26/11 drama: Kasab retracts 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      26/11 drama: Kasab retracts 
          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                              
	Mumbai, Dec. 18: Pakistani gunman Mohammed Ajmal Kasab today retracted his confession of guilt, claimed he had been falsely implicated and made a reference to US terror suspect David Headley in a courtroom drama aimed at derailing the 26/11 trial.        
	A number of eyewitnesses have identified Kasab and CCTV cameras at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus have captured him blazing away.        
	But Kasab made seemingly bizarre claims, contradicting his July 20 voluntary confession made before judge M.L. Tahilyani as well as the one recorded before a magistrate in February.        
	The 22-year-old said he was not a terrorist, had not fired at commuters at CST and had never ever seen an AK-47 before he was put on trial.         
	He said he travelled from Pakistan to New Delhi by the Samjhauta Express and came to Mumbai 20 days before 26/11 to find a house.         
	Special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam said Kasabs retraction would have no impact on the trial as the prosecution had produced adequate evidence of Kasabs role in the terror attacks.         
	We have produced sufficient evidence consisting of photographs, CCTV footage, and 610 witnesses to nail him, he said.        
	Leading criminal lawyer Majid Memon agreed. It is a mere formality. The accused is expected to deny all charges framed against him, he said.        
	Kasab also attempted to throw the prosecution off track by mentioning the name of Headley, the alleged Lashkar-e-Toiba operative arrested in the US.        
	Kasab said four white men  a reference to the FBI team that visited Mumbai  had come to interrogate him and seemed to indicate that Headley was among them. However, as soon as he mentioned the name Headley, the judge stopped him and warned him to only reply to questions he had been asked.        
	Nikam said Kasab had deliberately made references to Headley in a bid to prolong the trial.         
	He is very clever and knows how to pick up leads from court proceedings. Headleys name was referred in the court earlier and he may have picked up the reference, he said.         
	The gunman doesnt have access to newspapers and lives in solitary confinement in a heavily guarded cell.        
	Kasabs astonishing retraction came around 11.30am when he was called to record his statement on the evidence presented by the prosecution.         
	Dressed in white kurta-pyjama and sporting a stubble, Kasab set the tone for the proceedings with his third answer.         
	When Tahilyani wanted his address after asking him his name and age, Kasab replied: Faridkot, Punjab.         
	When the judge asked him if this was in Pakistan, Kasab said: Main toh Pakistan se aaye hoon. Faridkot aur Punjab India mein bhi hain. Yeh toh government ko tay karna hai (I came from Pakistan. But Faridkot and Punjab are there in India also. It is for the government to say where I came from).        
	Tahilyani had drawn up a questionnaire based on the evidence given by the 610 prosecution witnesses.         
	Kasab, who kept smiling all through, replied in the negative to most questions saying nahi ji, pata nahi, woh main nahi tha, and yeh sab jhoot hai.        
	When the judge asked him about his arrest, Kasab said he was walking along Juhu beach around 2.30 in the night, with his passport and Sony Ericsson mobile, when he was accosted by police. Pata nahi kidhar gaya mobile aur passport. Police ne liya hoga. Main picture ke chakkar mein aaya tha (I dont know where my mobile and passport went, police may have taken them. I had come looking for a break in films).         
	Kasab claimed he was falsely implicated because he resembles another gunman Abu Ali, who was shot dead.         
	When the judge asked him about his confession before the magistrate, Kasab said: Mujhe mara pita gaya. Purey galat bayan par meri dastkhat li gayi (I was beaten up. My signature was taken forcibly on a wrong statement).  
	gunman rsquo;S FLIP-FLOP

	Kasab: Faridkot, Punjab.   I came from Pakistan.  But Faridkot and Punjab are there in India also. It is for the  government to say where  I came from

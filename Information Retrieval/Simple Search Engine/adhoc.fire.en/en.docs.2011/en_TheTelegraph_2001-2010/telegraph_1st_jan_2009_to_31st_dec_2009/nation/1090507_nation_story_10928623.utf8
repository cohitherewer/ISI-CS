	New York, May 6 (PTI): Malayalam actor Mammooty was questioned by security officials at JFK airport over his Muslim name in the passport.        
	The 56-year-old actor, who arrived here on April 29, was separated for questioning for two hours after part of his official name, Muhammadkutty Ismail, popped up on the computer screen at the immigration counter. His full name is Muhammadkutty Ismail Paniparambil.        
	Mammooty was allowed to leave the airport only after the Indian consulate intervened informally and told the authorities that he was a popular south Indian actor who had visited the US several times.        
	Sources said the airport officials had instructions to check the details of all those passengers bearing the name Muhammad Ismail.

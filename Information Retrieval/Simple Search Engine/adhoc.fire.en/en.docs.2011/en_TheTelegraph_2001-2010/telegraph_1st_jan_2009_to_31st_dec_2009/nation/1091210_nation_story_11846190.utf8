          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 9: The economic decisions of the Left government in Bengal appear trapped in the limitations of its political ideology, Bangladesh Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus said today.         
	The economist turned social banker, here to deliver a lecture to Indian parliamentarians, said Bengal had failed to deliver on the innate potential of its people.         
	Given its potential, Bengal should have been the leader in India  in health, education and information technology. But it has failed to deliver on its potential, the 2006 Peace Prize winner, a Tagore fan, said.         
	Asked to identify reasons for the failure, Yunus said a combination of factors could be responsible.         
	Unlike China, which had invited private investment while retaining its political ideology, the Indian Left had failed in divorcing its economics from its politics, he argued.         
	As a result, there are constant problems each time they want to invite industry. So many have left Bengal, the latest being the Tatas, though in this case, the Opposition was also responsible.         
	But the fact that the Left government generally had to tackle an adverse central government may have made its development tasks harder, Yunus said.

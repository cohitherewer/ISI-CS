	New Delhi, March 7: India will respond next week to Pakistans request for additional information and clarifications on the Mumbai terror probe, sources said.         
	Pakistan had last month handed a list of 30 questions with its dossier on the attacks.        
	With the attack on the Sri Lankan team in Lahore focusing international attention on Pakistan, sources said, Delhi sharing the information it can will put to test Islamabads sincerity to crack down on terror networks.         
	The response is being formulated by the home ministry and seen by the foreign ministry.         
	Sources said answers to most questions can be found in the 11,280-page chargesheet filed in court. India will not respond to some other questions, which it finds diversionary and not relevant.         
	As for an authenticated copy of the confession of Ajmal Kasab, the lone surviving gunman, that Pakistan has sought, it has to give a judicial request or a letter rogatory, the sources said.

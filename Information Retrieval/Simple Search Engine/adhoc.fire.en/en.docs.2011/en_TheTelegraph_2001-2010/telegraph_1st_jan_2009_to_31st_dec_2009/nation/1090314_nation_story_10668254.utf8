The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Plan B out as pact flounders
                                                                                                               Plan B out as pact flounders
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, March 13: The Congress today said it planned to release its second list of candidates for Uttar Pradesh soon, calling it a Plan B at a time seat-sharing talks with the Samajwadi Party have hit a roadblock.        
	However, a PTI report said that Congress leader Digvijay Singh, when asked if the possibility of an alliance with the Samajwadis was over, said: From our side, the doors will always be open.        
	The Congresss first list already has 24 candidates, a number the Samajwadis have refused to concede.        
	Digvijay, Congress general secretary in charge of the state, said: We are falling back on Plan B and we will unveil our strategy in two or three days.        
	He implied that the main provocation was the Samajwadis unilateral announcement of candidates for 74 of the states 80 seats.        
	In every alliance, one has to declare candidates after we arrive at some consensus over seat-sharing. Unfortunately, the Samajwadi Party is releasing lists without taking us into confidence, Digvijay said.        
	From our side, we tried our best to see that except for six or eight seats where we would have friendly contests, there was an alliance on the rest. Unfortunately they didnt agree although in 2007 (the Assembly polls), they had friendly fights with their erstwhile ally, the CPM. So now we have to take a path that is different.        
	Some in the Congress, however, insisted that this was brinkmanship to bring the Samajwadis round to a respectable deal.        
	Digvijay indicated that the two parties had initially agreed that both would contest the seats where they had come first or second in the 2004 elections. The idea was that both parties were equally strong in these seats.        
	We were sceptical if our votes could be transferred to one another, Digvijay said.        
	He also implied that the Congresss workers in Uttar Pradesh continued to have issues with the Samajwadis, considering their bitter relations when Samajwadi chief Mulayam Singh Yadav was chief minister.        
	An alliance in Delhi does mean an alliance in every booth. During Mulayam Yadavs regime, there were a lot of contentious issues between the Samajwadis and local Congressmen. An alliance is successful only if there is a complete transfer of votes down the line.        
	Congress sources said the understanding could finally amount to the Samajwadis not fielding candidates from Rae Bareli and Amethi, the constituencies of Sonia and Rahul Gandhi.        
	They added that unlike Bengal, where Sonia was keen on an alliance with Mamata Banerjee, the Congress president and her son were not over-enthusiastic about a Samajwadi tie-up.        
	It was expedient to take the partys help to survive the trust vote and get the nuclear deal through. But an alliance on their political turf is another kettle of fish, a source said.        
	The Congress has indicated willingness to yield an extra seat to the Nationalist Congress Party in Maharashtra, after initially insisting on sticking to the 2004 arrangement  21 to the NCP and 27 to itself.        
	A Maharashtra MP today said the Congress was considering giving up one seat from its quota. NCP sources insisted they would settle for no less than half, that is 24 seats.

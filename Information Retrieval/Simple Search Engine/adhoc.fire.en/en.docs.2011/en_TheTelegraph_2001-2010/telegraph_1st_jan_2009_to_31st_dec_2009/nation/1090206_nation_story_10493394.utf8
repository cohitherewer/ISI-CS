The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Arjun bares cracks in quota stand
                                                                                                               Arjun bares cracks in quota stand
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Arjun Singh                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 5: A proposed law exempting top academic institutions from most job reservations could still be held back, education minister Arjun Singh has hinted, exposing cracks within the government over it.         
	The SC/ST (Reservation in Posts and Services) Bill 2008, which exempts IITs, IIMs, AIIMS and several central universities from reservations in faculty and non-faculty posts except at the lowest grade, has already been passed by the Rajya Sabha.         
	But the human resource development (HRD) minister today said: The bill has only been passed in one House. And you all know when and how it was passed.         
	The Upper House had passed the bill in December amid the din following minorities minister A.R. Antulays comments questioning the sequence of events during the Mumbai terror attacks. In all, 18 bills were passed in 10 minutes.         
	Asked whether faculty quotas would remain at the 47 institutions exempt under the bill, Singh said : There is a possibility and a probability (that the quotas will remain). I think a little patience is needed.         
	The bill has been crafted by the personnel and training department, shepherded by the Prime Ministers Office.         
	If passed in the Lok Sabha, the law will take away quotas available in all higher education institutions barring centres of strategic research and areas of super speciality where the number of trained personnel is limited.         
	The ruling UPA has positioned itself politically as an ally of backward communities and alienating this section, which forms a key chunk of the countrys electorate, could affect the coalitions prospects in the Lok Sabha polls, officials at the HRD ministry and the social justice ministry say.         
	The law would also pave the way for legal action by anti-quota activists seeking the extension of exemption to other academic institutions, they fear.         
	Singh, HRD ministry sources said, has asked his officials to seek legal opinion on the consequences of the bill.         
	A top social justice ministry official said the ministry would also raise concerns over the bill at the next cabinet meeting. Social justice minister Meira Kumar had said on Tuesday: It is yet to be cleared by both Houses of Parliament. All is not over.         
	But why were no objections raised at the cabinet meeting where the bill was initially cleared?         
	The bill, officials in the HRD ministry allege, was presented to the cabinet in a manner that suggests that it aims to cast in law reservations in jobs for SC/STs. The bill was dressed to fool. It was an act of cheating, an official said.         
	Singh could not attend the meeting as he was unwell.         
	Quotas have existed since the 1950s but as a result of executive orders issued by successive governments across the political spectrum. Technically, a future government could withdraw such orders.

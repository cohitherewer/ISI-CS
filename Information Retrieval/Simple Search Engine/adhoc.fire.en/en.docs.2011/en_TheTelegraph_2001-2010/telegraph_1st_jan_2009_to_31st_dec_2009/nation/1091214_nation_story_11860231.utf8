          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 13: Repudiating the announcement of chief minister Naveen Patnaik raising remuneration for sarpanchs and panchayat samiti members, Orissa State Panchayat Parishad, a body of elected panchayati raj representatives, today demanded constitutional powers and authority, not doles.        
	If the government grants power and authority, as mandated by the 73rd Constitutional Amendment, instead of financial dole for a section of panchayati raj representatives, it will fulfil Mahatma Gandhis dream of gram swaraj, said parishad chairman Sankarsan Parida.        
	Yesterday, Naveen had announced a hike in monthly honorarium for sarpanchs from Rs 600 to Rs 1,000 and that of panchayat samiti members from Rs 500 to Rs 1,000 at a BJD-sponsored rally of panchayat representatives here.        
	The government had failed to grant constitutional power to panchayat bodies even 16 years after the 73rd Constitutional Amendment and implement the recommendations of the round-table conference on panchayati raj held in 2004-05, Parida alleged.        
	Although the Naveen government announced in 2003 transfer of 21 subjects under 19 departments, it remained on pen and paper, he rued.         
	The parishad has been fighting for devolution of power to panchayati raj institutions, as mandated by the 73rd Constitutional Amendment.         
	If the government does not fulfil our demands, we will move court, Parida said.

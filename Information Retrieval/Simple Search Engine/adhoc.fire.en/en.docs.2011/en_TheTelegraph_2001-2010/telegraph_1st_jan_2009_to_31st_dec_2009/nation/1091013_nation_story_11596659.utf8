	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 12: Facing stiff competition from private couriers, India Post has now diversified its activities and is going to introduce core banking system at its post offices in Orissa shortly.        
	Chief post master-general of the Orissa circle Yeshodhara Menon said: We are ready in five major post offices at Sambalpur, Berhampur, Bhubaneswar, Cuttack and Rourkela for the phase-I launch. The facility will be extended to all post offices across the state within the next two years.

	Recently, Orissa postal circle took up a pilot project, in collaboration with the Union rural development ministry and panchayati raj department, for the disbursement of wage payment under National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) through smart cards with the help of mobiles.        
	The project was tested successfully at two sub-post offices (Gopalpur and Kamakshyanagar) and is under implementation in 25 branch offices across the state. The government has decided to make wage payment under NREGS through post office savings bank accounts.         
	By end of August, as many as 86,8,422 accounts have been opened in the post offices and an amount of Rs 57.38 crore has been deposited and Rs 45.70 crore has been disbursed.         
	Project Arrow, the project which envisages post offices as a window to the world for aam aadmi has been implemented in 88 post offices including all the 35 head post offices, Menon added. ICICI pension product is also being retailed through 35 head post offices in Orissa circle and transactions to the tune of Rs 3.70 lakh have been made so far. Besides, sale of non-life insurance product of the Oriental Insurance Company is also carried out through post offices for savings bank-holders. So far, 31,064 customers have been covered.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Victims of climate set sights on Copenhagen
                                                                                                               Victims of climate set sights on Copenhagen
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Dhumjee Baghel, Dalki Rawat and Tanusri Patra, who may represent India at the UN conference in Copenhagen. Rajesh Kumar                                  
	New Delhi, Nov.1: Tanusri Patra, a young woman from Govindpur Abad village in Bengals South 24-Parganas, may represent Indias possible climate change victims at the UN conference in Copenhagen later this year.        
	Patra, who lives on an island close to the southern-most tip of the Sunderbans, fears the Bay of Bengal may engulf her home. Her fishing and farming community is already encountering saltwater floods, an erratic river and loss of farmland.        
	But Patra and others from traditional communities across India experiencing the impacts of climate change hope to attend the conference not just with complaints but a set of possible solutions  drawn from their own communities.        
	They have formed a Peoples Coalition on Climate Change, representing 20 communities from across India  Jele fisher folk from the Sunderbans, the Bhils from Madhya Pradesh, the Dongria Kondhis tribe in Orissa, and the Chakhesang Naga tribe.         
	The climate change debate in India has largely remained in the stratosphere, said P.V. Satheesh, director of the Deccan Development Society, a non-government agency, in a document that outlines the genesis of the coalition. The concerns of indigenous forest communities, dry land farmers, pastoralists, fishers and mountain people were nowhere to be seen.        
	The partners discussed the projected impacts of climate change with these communities over the past several months and tried to understand how they would respond to the scenarios.        
	Traditional farming knowledge is our treasure  it could help us deal with the change, said Seno Tsuhah, a community development worker from Chizami village in Nagaland.         
	Tsuhah said the practice of planting a diverse range of crops had helped communities in her state remain resilient against changes in water and soil conditions in the past. The diversification of crops is one possible solution, she told The Telegraph.        
	The coalition engaged community elders, seeking information about their livelihood practices decades ago, and combined it with modern knowledge to create a charter of demands  the Community Charter on Climate Crisis.         
	It demands diversity of plants on farms and forests, afforestation with local plant species, self-regenerating agriculture using an appropriate mix of crops, shifting cultivation and ecological harvesting of fish tuned to the seasons.         
	We need to protect the mangrove areas here to protect our future, said Patra, referring to the Sunderbans. Current fishing practices are damaging the mangroves.         
	Traditional farm practices have died out in many areas, said Dalki Rawat, a social worker from Borqui village in Madhya Pradesh who, along with Dhumjee Baghel, represents a tribe from central India.         
	The elders among the Baiga tribe from Chhattisgarh, in discussions with coalition members, recalled how decades ago they grew 16 vegetables, 21 leafy plants and seven varieties of grasses for consumption.

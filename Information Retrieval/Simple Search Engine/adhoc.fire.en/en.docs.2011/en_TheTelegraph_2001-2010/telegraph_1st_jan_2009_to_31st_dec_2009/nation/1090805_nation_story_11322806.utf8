The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bajaj versus Brinda in RS
                                                                                                               Bajaj versus Brinda in RS
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             Bajaj, Karat                                 
	New Delhi, Aug. 4: Rahul Bajaj today complained his voice was being muffled after the CPMs Brinda Karat repeatedly cut the businessman short during a Rajya Sabha discussion on job losses citing conflict of interest.        
	They keep talking when others say something they do not like... my voice is being muffled in the House. This is not their majority, an annoyed Bajaj said.         
	The Bajaj Auto chairman was trying to argue that the government should relax some labour laws so more jobs could be generated when Karat kept butting in, saying there was a conflict of interest in what he was seeking.         
	There is a conflict of interest, was Karats constant refrain, an oblique reference to Bajaj being a businessman seeking changes in the law that could allow firms the hire-and-fire option the Left opposed.        
	Bajaj was apparently aware he was raising a hot-button issue but still wanted to be allowed to make his point.        
	I know what I am going to say is not politically acceptable but I would say especially about the organised (private) sector. For creating jobs, you have to relax some labour legislation and contract legislation. Then we in the organised sector will give higher wages, said the 71-year-old who has been elected from Maharashtra.        
	At this point, Karat chipped in, asking how the industrialist could ask for labour laws to be scrapped.         
	Irritated, Bajaj shot back, saying we (businessmen) have the right to express our views. Will the (labour) minister look at the possibility of relaxing labour laws? he went on to ask in the cacophony.        
	K. Rahman Khan, the deputy chairman presiding over the proceedings, tried to cool tempers by saying, he (Bajaj) is creating jobs.        
	But Karat didnt appear satisfied and was heard harping on the conflict of interest theme even as Bajaj concluded his speech asking the government to explain its stand.        
	Labour minister Mallikarjun Kharge responded, but not in words Bajaj may have wanted to hear. There were restrictions on layoffs under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, he stressed, appearing to rule out any such relaxation.        
	Kharge said states had been asked to implement labour laws to protect the interest of workers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong tries to rein in anti-Telangana lobby
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Cong tries to rein in anti-Telangana lobby
          SANJAY K. JHA                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 16: The Congress leadership has employed all its ingenuity and command in an attempt to restore in Andhra Pradesh without betraying any signs of rolling back the Telangana process.        
	Against the backdrop of a deep chasm among Andhra MPs, Sonia Gandhi has cancelled tomorrows meeting of Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP). Sonia was expected to take a position on Telangana at the meeting.        
	The CPP meeting may not take place in this session at all as any stand adopted by the party president however neutral it may be  could be interpreted differently by the two regions of Andhra and fuel unrest.        
	Both opponents and protagonists of Telangana said the high command was working on a dilatory strategy aimed at achieving the primary objective of bringing down the political temperature.        
	Congress leaders said the leadership had at no stage given any indication that Telangana would not come into being, though there has been no commitment on the time frame.        
	One MP told The Telegraph: The Prime Minister today bluntly told us that you want a united Andhra but Telangana people want division. How do we solve this? What to do to satisfy both sides?        
	The MPs who met Manmohan Singh this morning, however, sang a different tune before television cameras. They said the Prime Minister had promised to work out an amicable solution within a few days.        
	Other Congress leaders, however, said the MPs have now been firmly told to stop their campaign. No senior leader  Sonia, Manmohan or Pranab Mukherjee  will grant audience to them on this subject. We can only delay Telangana, not stop it, said an MP.        
	The anti-Telangana MPs lost heart last night when the cabinet committee on political affairs (CCPA) issued a bland statement, appealing for peace and harmony.        
	Sources said the Andhra MPs had demanded from the government a categorical statement saying that no further move to create Telangana would be taken till the resolution was passed in the Assembly.         
	But Chidambaram conveyed to them after the CCPA meeting that such a statement could not be made till Parliament was in session. Pranab Mukherjee also used the discordant notes struck by allies at the CCPA meeting as an excuse, arguing that any further movement will have to be okayed by the UPA collectively. Some Congress leaders said the opposition by allies such as the Trinamul Congress, NCP and the DMK came as a blessing in disguise for the government which is hunting for excuses to defer division of Andhra for some time.        
	While the opponents were pacified to some extent by putting off the process of adopting a resolution in the Assembly, the objection by the UPA allies is being used to justify the delay. The Centre cannot be seen as backtracking on its own after making the hasty announcement as this could trigger another violent backlash in the Telangana region.         
	After the initial bungling, veteran Pranab was entrusted with the damage-control assignment and he is now devising logical reasons for procrastination.        
	The joint opposition by all the allies came as a surprise to many as the NCP had already adopted a resolution in favour of Telangana and Sharad Pawar had even addressed a joint rally with K. Chandrasekhar Rao. But the CCPA discord gave additional ammunition to the Congress in its crackdown on the anti-Telangana campaign.        
	Even pro-Telangana leaders feel the midnight announcement didnt bear the stamp of Pranabs experience and justified Chidamabarams omission from the damage-control exercise.        
	The effect of the crackdown was vividly demonstrated in the absence of Jagan Mohan Reddy, who had waved a United Andhra card along with TDP members yesterday. The sources said Jagan would have to pay for his defiance and the plan to induct him as a junior minister at the Centre has almost been shelved.

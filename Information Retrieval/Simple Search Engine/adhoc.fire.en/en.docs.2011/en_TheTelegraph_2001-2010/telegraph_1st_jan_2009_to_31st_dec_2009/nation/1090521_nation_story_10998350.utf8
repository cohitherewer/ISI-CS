          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          People gather around the school van that was hit by the train in Jalandhar. (PTI)                                  
	Chandigarh, May 20: At least seven schoolchildren died today when the van carrying them failed to stop and sped into the path of an approaching train at an unmanned railway crossing in a Jalandhar village.         
	Police said the vans driver didnt apply the brakes though he saw the Ferozepur-Bhatinda Express approaching.        
	The impact of the collision drove the van 200 metres down the tracks.        
	Two students and the driver, Gurmel Singh, died on the spot while four others succumbed to their injuries in hospital.        
	The children, all students of Akal Academy in Bilga, were identified as Manjinder Singh, 15, Varinder Singh, 15, Sanjeev Kaur, 14, Simarjeet Kaur, 14, Komalpreet Kaur, 11, Jasleen Kaur, 5, and Jaskaran Singh, 5.         
	Eleven students have been hospitalised. The condition of one is said to be serious.         
	Initial investigations blame the driver for the tragedy. He saw the train approaching but did not stop in time, a district police officer said.        
	Over 30 students have lost their lives in accidents involving school buses and trains at unmanned railway crossings in Punjab in the past two years. There are about 10 to 20 unmanned level crossings in every district of the state.         
	In February, six schoolchildren were killed and over 16 injured when their van came in the way of an engine at an unmanned crossing near Haraj in Ferozepur. The driver had ignored cries of passengers who had tried to alert him about the approaching engine.         
	The Punjab government had requested the railway ministry to convert unmanned level crossings into manned ones with proper gates.         
	Police sources said a study by the railways safety division on deaths at unmanned crossings had found that wrong assessment of the speed of an approaching train was the main reason for accidents.

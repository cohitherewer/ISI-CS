The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Absconder tag on Modi minister 
                                                                                                               Absconder tag on Modi minister 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Modi: Aides under glare                                   
	Ahmedabad, Feb. 2: A Narendra Modi minister and a loyalist, both doctors, were today declared absconders in two Godhra riot cases being probed afresh by a special investigation team (SIT).        
	Mayaben Kodnani, the Gujarat junior minister for women and higher education, and Jaideep Patel, a former VHP leader, were issued summons by the Supreme Court-appointed team but neither answered them. Both face possible arrest.        
	We had issued summons to Mayaben on January 29 and 31 but she didnt turn up. So we have declared her an absconder and she may be facing arrest, an SIT officer told PTI.        
	We will try to arrest her as soon as possible.        
	Mayaben, a known Advani loyalist, is an accused in the 2002 Naroda Patia and Naroda Gam massacres in which minority community members were attacked and burnt alive by rioters. She faces charges of inciting mobs, rioting, arson and murder. Patel is an accused in the Naroda Gam case.        
	Mayaben and Patel have both moved anticipatory bail applications in a sessions court. The hearing is on Thursday.        
	Another SIT officer said team members had visited Mayabens official residence in the ministerial enclave as well as her personal residence in Ahmedabad but could not find her. Nor was she at her Naroda MLAs office. Even her mobile was switched off, he said.        
	Patel, who quit the VHP after falling out with Praveen Togadia and hopped onto chief minister Modis bandwagon before last years Assembly elections, was missing from his Gandhinagar residence.        
	We will see to it that the accused are arrested before the bail application comes up for hearing. Both their mobiles are switched off and they cannot be traced or contacted, the officer said.        
	When the SIT first issued them summons last year, both had apparently taken it lightly. The SIT team was even made to wait for them in Gandhinagar, the officer said.        
	Finally, when the duo chose to give their statements, both claimed innocence saying they had no hand in inciting the mobs.

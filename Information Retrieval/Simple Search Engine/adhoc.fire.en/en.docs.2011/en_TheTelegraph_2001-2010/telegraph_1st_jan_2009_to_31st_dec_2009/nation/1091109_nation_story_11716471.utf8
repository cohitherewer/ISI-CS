          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Nov. 8: A probe has been launched into whether David Headley, the American arrested by the FBI for allegedly plotting attacks in India at the Lashkar-e-Toibas behest, had a role in 26/11.        
	We are probing if Headley was involved in terror activities here, including the 26/11 terror strike. He had an office in AC Market Building in Tardeo in south Mumbai, joint police commissioner Rakesh Maria, who headed the attack investigation, said.         
	No direct proof has been found so far linking Headley and his arrested associate Tahawwur Hussain Rana, a Canadian of Pakistani origin, with the Mumbai terror strike, which was blamed on the Lashkar, Maria said.        
	However, police sources said the owner of the building where the duo operated their visa centre, and some other people, would be called for questioning tomorrow.         
	The visa centre, which sources said could have been managed by local associates of the duo, is suspected to have been part of Ranas First World Immigration Services, which has offices in Chicago, New York and Toronto.

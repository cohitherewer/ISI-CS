The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pak takes control of Dawa hub
                                                                                                               Pak takes control of Dawa hub
                            
	Islamabad, Jan. 25 (PTI): The Pakistan government took control of the sprawling headquarters of the Jamaat-ud-Dawa today in a crackdown on the front outfit of the Lashkar-e-Toiba, the militant group blamed for the November attacks in Mumbai.        
	Khakan Babar, recently appointed chief administrator by the government of Punjab province, took over the Dawas Markaz-e-Taiba headquarters in Muridke, about 30km from Lahore. A spokesman for the Markaz-e-Taiba described appointment of the administrator as a takeover under international pressure.        
	The Dawa was outlawed shortly after the UN Security Council declared it a Lashkar front in December last year, interior ministry chief Rehman Malik had said earlier, though diplomatic sources said the Pakistan government had not yet formally notified the ban.        
	The takeover was completed in the presence of Lahores commissioner, the district police chief, an official of the Auqaf, or religious affairs department, and a police contingent. Babar will supervise and monitor all activities at the Dawas headquarters, the Dawn News channel reported.        
	Babar, his eight-member staff and about a dozen policemen will be stationed at the Markaz-e-Taiba complex that includes a school, a college and a hospital.        
	Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed and several other top leaders of the group are currently under house arrest. Their detention was recently extended by two months, though there have been reports that Saeed and the other leaders were allowed to move out of their homes on several occasions.        
	The Pakistan government claims that 124 members of the Dawa and other banned groups have been detained while dozens of Dawa offices have been sealed across the country.        
	The government, however, says it can take legal action against the Dawa leaders only if India provides proof of their involvement in the Mumbai attacks that claimed nearly 180 lives as 10 terrorists went on a killing spree.        
	Ajmal Kasab, the lone terrorist captured alive during the carnage, has revealed during interrogation that he and the nine slain attackers had received training at Lashkar camps in Pakistan.

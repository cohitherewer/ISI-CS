          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 29: Orissas maiden central university was launched today in one of the most backward regions of the country to bring education to the doorsteps of tribals and underprivileged youths.        
	Inaugurating it at Nishani Mundali in Koraput, Union human resource development minister Kapil Sibal said the universitys location was the reflection of pro-tribal policy of the Congress-led UPA government.        
	This university will definitely help in development of backward Kalahandi-Bolangir-Koraput (KBK) region and western Orissa, said Sibal.        
	Stating that the Centre was keen to set up international standard educational institutions across the country through public-private partnership, Sibal said companies should come forward to set up such institutes to help students to pursue higher studies in India instead of going abroad.        
	The Centre has decided to set up 3,500 model schools mostly in backward areas across the country, he said. Besides, the Union government is planning to set up 200 more kendriya vidyalayas within next two years, Sibal added.        
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik promised that the state government would provide land free of cost to the university and ensured all facilities, including water and electricity. He also urged Sibal to set up a medical college in the KBK region and allot more model schools to the state.

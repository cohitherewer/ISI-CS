                                                                                                               Two Babri land files ruined
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Aug. 25: The CBI has told Allahabad High Court that it has recovered 10 of 23 missing files on the Ayodhya case, two of which have been almost wholly destroyed and one is a photocopied version.        
	The two ruined files were about the Babri Masjid land dispute, the CBI told the Lucknow bench of the court in its interim report submitted yesterday.         
	CBI sources said a detailed investigation was on to find out who were behind the deliberate liquidation of these two files.         
	The CBI said it would complete the investigation in a week and submit a full report. The court has fixed September 21 for the next hearing.         
	The Lucknow bench had on July 15 ordered a probe on an allegation that the files had been missing from the Uttar Pradesh home department since 1998, when the BJP was in power at the Centre.         
	The documents include a telegram sent by Jawaharlal Nehru in 1949.         
	The agency said the recovery of eight intact files was a breakthrough and that the state government was fully co-operating with the investigation.

He said the firm would use the hospital kitchen to prepare food and operate with its own accessories a bulk trolley system with the food portioned and served at the ward level to patients in their own utensils.        
	Fish and egg would be served once a week, while rice, vegetables and dal would be the daily diet for required 2,000 kilo-calories for each patient.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong gets new leaders
                                                                                                               Cong gets new leaders
                            
	Patna, June 28 (PTI): Former LJP MP Ranjit Singh and hundreds of his supporters today shook hands with the Congress, in presence of Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) president Anil Kumar Sharma and other senior leaders.        
	CPM leader Balik Ram, general secretary of minority cell of the JD(U) Mohammad Asad and several JD(U) leaders also joined the Congress at a function organised at Sadaqat Ashram, the state headquarters of the party today.        
	Speaking at the occasion, Sharma said the politicians who were dedicated to the cause of those who are oppressed were joining the Congress to fulfil their dreams of true service.        
	On the other hand, he went on to add, those who harboured no intention to address real issues would take sides with the JD(U), RJD and LJP, for political gains.        
	Congress is the only party that seems to be committed to work for all sections of the society under the dynamic leadership of its president Sonia Gandhi and general secretary Rahul Gandhi. Other parties seem to be interested in political gains and in snatching power by hook or by crook, Sharma said, addressing a large gathering of supporters.         
	The Congress us the natural home for those who are sincere in their work, he added.        
	Welcoming the new entrants, BPCC working president Sameer Kumar Singh said that this trend of other party leaders joining the Congress was an indication that none of the parties could prevent the Congress from coming into power in the 2010 Assembly elections to be held in October-November.

	Patna, Aug. 19: An 11-member central team arrived here today to assess the drought situation in Bihar even as the monsoon staged a strong revival across the state.        
	Bihar has already declared 26 of the states 38 districts drought-hit.         
	The central team, headed by agriculture joint secretary R.K. Tiwary, divided itself into three groups and proceeded to three different drought-hit districts.         
	The teams visited Asarganj village in Munger, Ekma and Dawood Nagar in Chapra and Wajirganj, Dumaria and Tekari in Gaya district.        
	Sources in the team  scheduled to stay in the state for three days  said that it would talk to affected farmers and officials in the districts to prepare a report to be submitted to the Union government.         
	The Nitish Kumar government has submitted a memorandum to the Centre demanding a special package of over Rs 23,000 crore to deal with the drought.         
	The central teams assessment report will constitute the basis for the Union government to decide on the quantum of funds to be ultimately given.        
	We have not sought a drought package. We have asked for assistance to deal with drought, Nitish said after meeting agriculture minister Sharad Pawar today.        
	The arrival of the central team coincided with the monsoon getting stronger across the state. Bihar has been witnessing ample rain for the past five days.         
	In the last 36 hours, it recorded 30mm of rainfall.        
	Patna meteorological office director A. Chanda said the monsoon had formed a tough line in Bihar as a result of which the state has got thick layers of dark clouds fed by moist winds from the Bay of Bengal. He forecast heavy rains almost across the state in the days to follow.        
	Though the state has lost almost 50 per cent of its crops because of delayed monsoon, agriculture experts believe that if it recorded 300mm of rainfall till the end of August, it will be able to salvage at least 50 per cent of the remaining paddy crop.         
	On its part, the Bihar government has formulated a plan to deal with the drought situation.         
	The agriculture department has been dispatching team of officials, including agriculture experts, in all affected blocks to provide technical assistance to farmers.        
	Nitish reiterated his demand from the Centre to build minor and major irrigation projects under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and increase mandays under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme from 100 to 150 a year in the drought-hit districts.

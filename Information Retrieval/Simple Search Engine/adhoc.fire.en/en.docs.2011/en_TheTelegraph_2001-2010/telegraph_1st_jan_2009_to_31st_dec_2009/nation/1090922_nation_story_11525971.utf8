The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Warn vendor before you take a sip
                                                                                                               Warn vendor before you take a sip
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 21: Whenever you buy packaged food or drink, warn the retailer you will have it analysed if it makes you ill.        
	That seems the lesson from a recent Supreme Court ruling, which says a consumer cannot criminally prosecute a food manufacturer for adulteration unless she has informed the vendor at the time of purchase that she intends to get the sample analysed.        
	Therefore, unless you have so warned the retailer beforehand, you cannot prosecute the company on the strength of the particular sample that made you ill. You have to go back to the retailer and buy a different sample of the same product, this time issuing the warning, and get that second sample tested.        
	But its possible the first sample was adulterated while the second isnt  so your case falls through.        
	These provisions of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954, which the apex court reaffirmed on September 10, are intended to protect manufacturers from false cases, legal experts said.        
	But what if you have warned the retailer beforehand but he later denies it? The experts said the provision was only meant to give the retailer a chance to refuse to sell (so the company cannot be trapped by unscrupulous people), but in a dispute the presumption would be in your favour if the analysis proved adulteration.        
	What if you didnt warn the vendor, fell ill, got the original sample analysed and the test report suggested adulteration? You still cannot prosecute.        
	Two other points: you must get your sample tested (after forewarning the retailer) by a government analyst from the food inspectors office, and must attach a copy of the analysts report with your complaint.        
	The good news is, the forewarning clause applies only if you want to fight the case yourself, whether its a criminal case before a magistrate or a case for compensation in a consumer court.        
	The better option is to let the authorities fight the case on your behalf  then the warning requirement does not apply.        
	You just lodge a police complaint and contact the food inspector and tell her you fell ill after, say, drinking from a soft drinks bottle. Hand over any unopened bottles to her for analysis. If you dont have any, she will collect independent samples to test your claim. If they are proved to be adulterated, she sends a report to local health authorities, who will prosecute the retailer.        
	Or, in case of a consumer case, you contact the controller of weights and measures and lodge a case in a consumer court.        
	This is the easier option, since even if you decide to fight the case yourself, you cannot do so without written consent from the central or state government or an official authorised to give such sanction on their behalf (such as the food inspector).        
	The court ruling came as it quashed charges of adulterating a bottle of Limca against the manager of a bottling company. The complainant had not forewarned the retailer, and the magistrate had taken cognisance of the case without waiting for the analysts report.

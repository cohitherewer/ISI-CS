The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nominee amp; heir must share: SC
                                                                                                               Nominee amp; heir must share: SC
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 23: The Supreme Court has held that a nominee is entitled to receive the money of a person who dies without leaving a will but the sum will have to be shared with all the legal heirs.        
	It is made abundantly clear that the amount in any head can be received by the nominee but the amount can be claimed by heirs of the deceased in accordance with the law of succession governing them. In other words, nomination does not confer any beneficial interest on the nominee, the apex court said last week.         
	The order came in a case where a widow, Shipra Sengupta, and her mother-in-law, Niharbala, were battling over an SBI head clerks money.         
	Bhopal resident Shyamal Sengupta, who made his mother his nominee in all his accounts and left it unchanged, died issueless in 1990.        
	Although Niharbala, too, died while the case was pending, Madhya Pradesh High Court said that in view of the nomination, the entire provident fund would go to one of her sons on the basis of an alleged will executed before her death.         
	Shipra then moved the apex court. Nomination only indicates the hand authorised to receive the amount on payment, she said, citing an earlier judgment.        
	Shipra also argued that Niharbalas nomination before marriage could not destroy her own right under the Indian Succession Act, 1956.        
	The apex court upheld her contention, saying both women were Shyamals heirs and entitled to his money.

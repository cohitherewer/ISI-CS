                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      AI pilot truce after   2-month pledge
                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 29 (PTI): Air India pilots have withdrawn a strike scheduled from Monday midnight following the managements assurance that all pending issues would be resolved in the next two months.        
	We had a successful meeting with the management following which we have withdrawn our strike call with immediate effect, Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA) general secretary R.S. Otaal said.        
	The ICPA, a non-executive pilot body of the erstwhile Indian Airlines, had written a letter on November 2 to the National Aviation Company of India Limited (Nacil) chairman and managing director Arvind Jadhav threatening to go on strike from November 24 if the management did not re- solve long-pending issues, including settling their due allowances.        
	However, after a meeting with the management on November 14 and 20 the strike call was deferred to Monday.        
	The management has assured that all our pending allowances will be cleared by February and the rest of the issues will also be resolved, Otaal said.        
	The meeting lasted more than eight hours and was represented by Air Indias general manager (operations), Otaal said.        
	The pilots have been protesting the continuous deferment of salary allowances for the past 4-5 months.        
	The association also claimed that the erroneous policies of the management were responsible for the losses the national carrier had run up over the years and demanded fixing responsibility for the mess.        
	Earlier, Otaal had said: The strike has been called to save Air India. We intend to tell the public and the political leadership what is wrong with Air India.

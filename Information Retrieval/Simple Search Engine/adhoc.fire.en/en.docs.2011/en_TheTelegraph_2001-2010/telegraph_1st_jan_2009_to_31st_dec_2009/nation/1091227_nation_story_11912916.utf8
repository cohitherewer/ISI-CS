          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 26: The human resource development ministry has relaxed the age limit in its effort to select a new head for Indias apex school policy agency, ostensibly because it cannot find qualified young educationists for the post.        
	Unable to pin down suitable candidates under the prescribed age limit of 57, the ministry will now consider even older educationists for the job of director of the National Council for Education Research and Training (NCERT), The Telegraph has learnt.        
	The relaxation of the age norm makes outgoing director Krishna Kumar, 58, an eligible candidate though it could not be confirmed whether he has applied for a second term.        
	The move has triggered a debate among some ministry officials on whether India indeed lacks younger educationists capable of heading top agencies. And if so, why?        
	Under current rules, NCERT directors retire at 62 or at the end of their five-year term, whichever comes earlier. The HRD ministry, in its advertisement for Kumars successor on September 26, specified the candidate shall not be more than 57 years old as on 1 January, 2010.        
	The ministry has since received several applications from candidates spanning education and the civil services.        
	But unlike most other top education posts, the qualifications required for the NCERT top job are loaded in favour of educationists  a PhD and a first-division performance at the post-graduate level are minimum requirements.        
	HRD minister Kapil Sibal too is keen that educationists be preferred for top posts at institutions under his ministry.        
	But the ministry has now modified the age criterion it had listed in the original advertisement. However, in case of exceptionally qualified candidates, this may be relaxed, the modified qualifications state.        
	Sources said the ministry had repeatedly used the flexible age limit concept, particularly in the past couple of years, while appointing bosses of educational institutions. Officially, the argument in each case has been that the ministry could not find qualified candidates who met the age norm.        
	But after this latest move, some ministry officials and retired policy makers, who are against this strategy of leaving the age limit loose, have hinted that in many cases the aim is to facilitate the application of a particular candidate.        
	They cited the instance of former Central Board of Secondary Education chairman Ashok Ganguly who tried convincing then HRD minister Arjun Singh to relax the age limit when his term ended last year.        
	The ministry eventually did not buckle, but Gangulys case was the exception rather than the rule, a retired bureaucrat from the ministry said.        
	Other critics of the decision to repeatedly allow relaxed age limits  why have an age limit at all in that case, they argue  were more charitable to the government.        
	Despite what we may say officially, perhaps we start analysing candidates from pre-determined positions. This possibly makes us incapable of appreciating more raw potential and makes us pick slightly more predictable  and older  candidates, an official said.

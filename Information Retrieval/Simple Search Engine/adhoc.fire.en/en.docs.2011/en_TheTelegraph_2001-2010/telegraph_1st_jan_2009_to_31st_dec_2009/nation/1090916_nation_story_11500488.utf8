The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PM sees sea hole, cops wade in 
                                                                                                               PM sees sea hole, cops wade in 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Singh at the conference. (PTI)                          
	New Delhi, Sept. 15: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said infiltration through the sea was increasing, prompting the security establishment to discuss the threat.        
	Infiltration across the line of control (LoC) and also via other routes such as Nepal, Bangladesh and the sea is going up, Manmohan Singh told a conference of directors-general and inspectors-general of police here.         
	Singhs mention of the threat from the sea  under the glare after the Mumbai attack by gunmen who sailed to the city undetected  came as sources spoke of arrests, some on suspicion of terror links, in the coastal states over the past few months.        
	The aim of the discussions that followed the Prime Ministers speech was to find ways to solve the problems of co-ordination, lack of facilities and shortage of trained manpower that plague coastal security. Officers of the navy, also invited to the meeting, took part in the discussions.        
	One proposal, said to have been mooted by Intelligence Bureau director Rajiv Mathur, was for the home ministry to take over the policing of the Brown Waters, a zone up to 200 nautical miles from the coast that is overseen by the coast guard, which is under the navy.        
	But the plan ran into opposition from some police officials. Kerala police chief Jacob Punnoose, among those who didnt favour the idea, said his force didnt have the resources, manpower or cash, to patrol the sea so far, the sources said.        
	Some officials of the navy appeared to agree with him, saying training marine personnel took years and, therefore, state police couldnt be expected to suddenly take up the coast guards responsibility.        
	Another key area discussed was co-ordination, which would be put to test in a joint exercise involving the navy, coast guard, state marine police and the customs after the monsoon, the sources said.        
	Although a joint operations centre has been established on the east and west coasts, there is a lack of clear guidelines on which among the various agencies runs the show.        
	Navy chief Admiral Nirmal Verma is said to have raised the point at the conference today.         
	The navy chief said that there should be a band-master (a leader) in the exercise, a source said.

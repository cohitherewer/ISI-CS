The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sonia signal to rebels
                                                                                                               Sonia signal to rebels
                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 10 (PTI): A day before campaigning ends for the Assembly polls in three states, Sonia Gandhi has asked Congress rebels to set aside personal ambitions for the larger good of the party.        
	More often than not our internal differences have prevented us from translating the substantial goodwill we enjoy amongst the people into electoral advantage for ourselves, Sonia said in a letter to party workers in the latest issue of the party mouthpiece, Congress Sandesh.        
	Apparently sending a signal to rebels that indiscipline would not be tolerated, she said these elections were a historic opportunity to demonstrate that we have learnt from experience and that we will function cohesively, setting personal ambitions aside.         
	We have to function with a single-minded sense of purpose. It is natural to aspire for a ticket, but obviously not everyone can be accommodated, she said.        
	Those who stand as our candidates on our symbol must get the unstinted support of everyone of us. In the victory of the party lies the victory of individual Congress men and women, Sonia said.        
	She expressed confidence that party activists were conscious of their responsibilities and would discharge them with dedication and devotion.

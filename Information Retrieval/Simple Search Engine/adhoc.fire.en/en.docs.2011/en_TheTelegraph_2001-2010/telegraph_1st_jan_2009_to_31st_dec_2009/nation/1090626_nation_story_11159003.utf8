	New Delhi, June 25: A move by some Pinarayi Vijayan loyalists to raise money towards the Kerala CPM secretarys legal expenses has again brought the two party factions in the state at loggerheads.        
	Although the CPM hasnt given any formal call for donations, a lobby is unofficially trying to collect funds from party members and workers.        
	Chief minister V.S. Achuthanandans camp sees this as an attempt by the Vijayan faction to needle it by suggesting the cadres are behind their leader, who faces a court battle in the SNC Lavalin corruption case.        
	The fresh bout of infighting comes a week before the CPM meets in Delhi, on July 4 and 5, to address the factional rivalry and organisational issues in Kerala.        
	Yes, theres a move to collect money. The party hasnt taken any formal decision on this. Its just (the Vijayan camps) way of spiting its opponents  they know the party itself can afford it (Vijayans legal costs), a leader from the chief ministers faction said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Left stages vote farce in House
                                                                                                               Left stages vote farce in House
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 18: The Left today insisted on a farce of a vote on its amendments to the Presidents address though it didnt even have all its members present in Parliament.        
	The amendments were defeated by voice vote, but Left MPs demanded a division twice.         
	Basudeb Acharya moved two amendments on price rise and job losses, and Roopchand Pal moved an amendment seeking review of the Indo-US nuclear deal.         
	The Opposition benches were empty with only a few BJP members present. Not all the Left MPs were present either. The ruling combine, however, was in full force.         
	But Acharya and Pal were not happy with a voice vote and insisted the supporters of their amendments outnumbered the members in the treasury benches.         
	Speaker Somnath Chatterjee had to get the lobby cleared twice and order a second division after the first fell through miserably.         
	While the first vote went in favour of the government 145-45, the second was even better with 146-43.         
	The Left was clearly not ready for the battle but wanted to make a point since the issues on which the amendments were moved are dear to the communists.

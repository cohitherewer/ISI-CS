The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sibal focus on child in autonomy plan
                                                                                                               Sibal focus on child in autonomy plan
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, July 15: Autonomy in education must focus on giving more options to children, human resource development minister Kapil Sibal argued today in an impassioned plea to MPs to help move towards uniform schooling standards.         
	We must think of autonomy from the childs point of view. We must give the child freedom to choose what he or she wants to study and become in life. And that requires giving children greater options, Sibal said, in a speech that lasted over half an hour, after nearly five hours of debate on education.         
	Arguing in favour of a slew of controversial plans and ideas he has mooted, the lawyer clarified that none of his proposals for education reforms would be implemented in a rush.         
	Reducing examination stress on schoolchildren is a part of the governments education policy and making the Class X board examination optional has been proposed by several government panels in the past, Sibal pointed out.        
	There is nothing new in what I have said. But we must think about why these things have not happened all these years. I am told to be cautious. Should I continue to remain cautious after all these years? the minister asked.        
	He clarified that he was working towards making only the Central Board of Secondary Education Class X exams optional, not those conducted by state boards that are not in my control.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Oct. 9: With border security, environment and rural development challenges on its agenda, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) today began its three-day national working committee meeting at Rajgir in Nalanda, the home district of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar.        
	The Hindu outfits spokesman, Manmohan Vaidya, informed reporters of the multi-pronged agenda soon after RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat inaugurated the meet. RSS sources said that Maoist menace had turned out to be an obstacle in the way of rural development and that RSS top brass would work on the strategy to counter the violence.        
	Apparently, drought, recurring floods and global warming will also be in focus.         
	The mother outfit of the Sangh Parivar would also examine the role and relationship of the BJP with the Nitish Kumar-led government and issue a guideline for the future course of action. Senior BJP leaders, however, were conspicuous by their absence.         
	Asked about the absence, Manmohan Vaidya said: It is an internal meeting with 350 cadre are participating. He refused to say anything further on the matter.        
	Sources revealed that the top VHP leaders  another wing of the RSS  Praveen Togadia and Ashok Singhal would join the conclave tomorrow.        
	RSSs karyawahak mandal (working committee) meet, first of its kind and that too in Nitish Kumars home district has triggered a war of words between the ruling JD(U) and its rival RJD.        
	RJD general secretary Ramkripal Yadav said that the RSS meet would trigger communal tension in Bihar. The likes of Praveen Togadia and Ashok Singhal were not allowed to enter Bihar when Lalu Prasads RJD was in power, Ramkripal said, adding: The state has been treating leaders of the communal outfit as its guests.        
	The JD(U) responded by stating that the RSS is not a banned outfit and as such it is entitled to organise its meeting anywhere it likes.

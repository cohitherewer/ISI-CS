	New Delhi, Oct. 25: Bhupinder Singh Hoodas rivals in the Congress may have unwittingly done him a good turn last night.        
	Party chief Sonia Gandhis midnight blow to the Haryana chief ministers opponents came because she was convinced there would be no consensus on the top post through negotiations, sources said.        
	Eight of the Congresss 10 Lok Sabha MPs from Haryana thought this was the best time to press the exit button on Hooda, who was vulnerable despite the support of seven Independents.         
	In such a scenario, Sonia thought the only way to win the battle was to present them with a fait accompli. Hooda kept his chair in Haryana and Ashok Chavan was retained as the chief minister in Maharashtra.         
	Her choice of Hooda left the Haryana MPs numb as they had carefully plotted his ouster after the elections, the sources said.        
	The eight Haryana MPs had given it in writing to Sonia that they were opposed to Hooda after a meeting among themselves where aspiring chief minister Kumari Selja was present. Twenty-eight MLAs, who too were against Hooda, were ready to testify before Sonia against him.        
	Few leaders expected the announcements of the chief ministers names past midnight as there was no hurry to form the governments in either Maharashtra or Haryana. But the relentless opposition to the incumbents in both the states had rendered the consultations meaningless.         
	The only way Sonia could have appointed chief ministers of her choice was by using her veto power.         
	Hooda was sworn in already, leaving no room for further negotiations.        
	Bhajan Lals Haryana Janhit Congress, too, was trying to drive a hard bargain. Sources said Bhajan Lals party was forced to redraw its strategy after last nights decision.         
	Some senior leaders, however, insisted that Sonia cleared Hoodas name only after the Janhit Congress hinted it would support a government led by him. But the final word will be out only on Monday when Kuldeep Bishnoi, Bhajan Lals son, announces his partys decision        
	Party leaders say Bhajan Lal and his family would be duly compensated for this compromise.         
	The sources said the deal had not been fully worked out yet, but no minister took oath with Hooda in Chandigarh today as Bishnoi may be inducted in the cabinet, in case his party supports Hooda.         
	The Congress high command is said to have offered governorship for Bhajan Lal, probably in Gujarat.        
	Bhajan Lal, who has been the Haryana chief minister twice and a minister in the Rajiv Gandhi cabinet at the Centre, had been the face of the Congress in Haryana for over three decades. He left the party disgruntled after Hooda was made the chief minister in 2005. The Congress, however, was reluctant to make Bishnoi the deputy chief minister as he had demanded.         
	Congress leaders, who held several rounds of negotiations with Bhajan Lal and Bishnoi, clearly told them that conditions on the choice of chief minister was not acceptable. The matter is likely to be resolved by tomorrow.         
	Sources said the Congress high command, which faced stiff opposition from its own MPs on Hooda, did not want to be dictated on the matter of leadership. It had resisted attempts from a powerful ally like the NCP to block Vilasrao Deshmukh in Maharashtra twice in the past.         
	But Bhajan Lal was assured of an honourable return to the party.         
	Hoodas cabinet will be sworn in only after the trial of strength, which has to be done within a week. The Janhit Congresss entry would enable the Congress to handle the Independents with greater firmness.

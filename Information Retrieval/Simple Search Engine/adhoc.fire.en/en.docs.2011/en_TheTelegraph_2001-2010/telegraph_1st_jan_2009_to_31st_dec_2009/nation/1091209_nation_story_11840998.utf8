          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 8: For a moment today, veteran Congress leader Pranab Mukherjee appeared to forget the role he played in the government 25 years ago  but stopped himself from an error that some may have described as a Freudian slip.         
	Twenty five years ago, when I was Prime....eh... finance minister, I did not have even Rs 5 for subsidies for social sector programmes, Mukherjee told the Lok Sabha, arguing that divestment of certain public sector units had helped generate funds that supplemented budget allocations for social sector schemes.         
	Mukherjees near-slip-of-the-tongue had the media gallery and some MPs in splits because of a rumour from history that the leader had once viewed himself as a potential Prime Minister. He has himself never confirmed that he ever had any such ambitions.         
	Mukherjee was today responding to a calling attention motion initiated by CPMs Basudeb Acharya who accused the government of privatising profit-making public sector firms.         
	The finance minister clarified that the government, under no circumstances, would allow its ownership of profitable PSUs to drop below 51 per cent.

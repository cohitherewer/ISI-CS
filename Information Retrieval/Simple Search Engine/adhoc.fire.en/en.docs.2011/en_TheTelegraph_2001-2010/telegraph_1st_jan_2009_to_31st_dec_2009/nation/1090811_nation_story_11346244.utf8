          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A plot allotted for the construction of one of the hotels. (PTI)                                   
	Lucknow, Aug. 10: Mayavatis axe of retribution today fell on bureaucrats perceived to be loyal to her political rivals with the government suspending three IAS officers over an alleged land deal in Noida struck by the Mulayam Singh Yadav regime.        
	The three were among 16 senior officials shown the door by the government, which claimed that the allotment of land for tourism development had led to a loss of over Rs 4,721 crore to the exchequer.         
	The deal had been inked in January 2007, when Mulayam as chief minister had allotted land to 31 hotel owners under the tourism policy conceived by the Industrial Development Corporation.         
	The corporation, then headed by Amar Singh, general secretary of Mulayams Samajwadi Party, had identified land in Noida for allowing hotel owners to set up three, four and five-star properties. The Samajwadi government had projected Noida as a tourist centre in view of the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi.         
	The Mayavati regime alleged the plots were distributed at throwaway prices.         
	Vijay Shankar Pandey, secretary to the chief minister, said that though the market price for land in Noida was Rs 70,000 per sqm, the hotel owners were given plots for just Rs 7,400 per sqm. This, he contended, had caused a loss of Rs 4721.14 crore to the state.         
	In May 2007, when Mayavati became chief minister, her government ordered cancellation of the allotment.         
	The IAS officers who got the axe today were then at the helm of the Noida Development Authority: Rakesh Bahadur, its then chairman, Sanjiv Sharan, then chief executive officer, and Ravindra Naik, then additional CEO. Bahadur and Sharan are currently members of the revenue board while Naik is the district magistrate of Lakhimpur Kheri.         
	The government has also ordered action against Dev Dutt, a retired IAS officer who has been chairman of the Noida Development Authority.         
	The other officials who have been suspended were posted at different places in Noida during the alleged scam.         
	All those suspended are considered close to the Samajwadi Party.         
	Mayavati has directed police to lodge FIRs against the 16. The chief minister, who in 2007, had ordered immediate punishment of the officers who were involved in the irregularities, has also ordered a probe into the delay in taking action against these officers.         
	One of the suspended officers said the bureaucracy had become a scapegoat in the political tussle in Uttar Pradesh.        
	The land allotment was made under a policy adopted by the government in 2006. The tourism policy, which allowed bypassing of the bidding process to avoid delay, was part of a Cabinet decision. How can a bureaucrat be blamed for that? said the officer, who did not wish to be named.

          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              Modi, Chauhan				                                 
	New Delhi, Sept. 29: Narendra Modi and Shivraj Singh Chauhan worshipped an AK-47, 9mm pistols and other firearms on the last day of Dussehra in deference to an age-old Bharatiya tradition.        
	The tradition does not trace its roots to either Gujarat or Madhya Pradesh, the states the two chief ministers rule. The origins lie in their common neighbour, Maharashtra, where no chief minister, not even those of the Shiv Sena, ever practised it publicly.        
	The occasion was a shastra puja (worship of arms) at the official homes of the chief ministers.        
	The ceremony, in which they offered prayers primarily to the arms used by their security guards  since both of them claimed the only weapon they possessed was a symbolic talwar (sword)  provoked comments from the BJP and sections of the Opposition for different reasons.        
	Some BJP leaders wondered how the two chief ministers, who do not belong to any martial caste, had appropriated a practice that was historically the preserve of the Rajputs.        
	These leaders, mostly Rajputs themselves, felt that the puja was Modis way of reasserting his macho image and signalling his commitment to fight terrorism.        
	The Congress  the principal Opposition in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat  was coy about making known its response. Off the record, some leaders questioned the propriety and even the constitutionality of venerating weapons used by security forces who are government employees owing allegiance to a secular state and not an individual politician.        
	One Congress leader questioned the legality of asking these guards, who protect chief ministers in the high-risk category, to disarm themselves for the duration of the puja and risk endangering their lives as well as those of the leaders.        
	But others defended the chief ministers. These (the critics) are people who do not understand the meaning of Bharatiya culture and tradition. Politicians are part of our society and wedded to its traditions, said Purshottam Rupala, Gujarat BJP president and Rajya Sabha MP.        
	Insisting that Modi had been doing the shastra puja since 2002, Rupala stressed that the ritual did not belong to any caste.

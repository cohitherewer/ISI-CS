          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, March 29: The BJP, keen to put up a strong fight against Congress MP Priya Dutt in the Mumbai North Central seat, has zeroed in on four names.        
	Doing the rounds are the names of Ram Jethmalanis lawyer son, Mahesh, the daughter of the late BJP leader Pramod Mahajan, Poonam, actor Paresh Rawal and Vinod Tawde, the general secretary of the BJPs state unit.         
	Jethmalani, 52, and Poonam, 28, are the front runners.         
	Known to advise senior BJP and Shiv Sena leaders, Mahesh has defended Maya Kodanani, the Gujarat minister accused in the 2002 riots, and sadhvi Pragya Singh, an accused in the Malegaon blast.         
	He denied being approached by any political party, but asked if he intended to join politics, Mahesh said: Yes, of course, I have political ambitions.        
	Poonam is being considered after being denied the Mumbai South seat she had asked for. She sent BJP state unit into a tizzy by visiting Raj Thackeray on Friday. Her name was picked as a possible candidate for Mumbai North Central a day after the visit.

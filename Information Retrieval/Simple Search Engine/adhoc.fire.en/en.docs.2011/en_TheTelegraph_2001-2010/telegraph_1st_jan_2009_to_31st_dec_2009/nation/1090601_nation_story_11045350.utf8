          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, May 31: Close on the heels of the abduction of a teenager who was sodomised and killed, Patna police rescued a nonagenarian from his captors who had allegedly wished to grab his 52-room Patna mansion.        
	Police said that relatives and tenants of Bhagwan Narayan Pandey, 95, held him hostage in his own house at Dewan Mohalla near Ramjanki roundabout. The police freed him following a tip-off from Pandeys neighbours.        
	The force has registered an FIR against the father of Pandeys former daughter-in-law, Pradip Pandey, wife Indu Devi, tenant Bablu and five associates.        
	Police said the accused allegedly locked Pandey in a room four days ago with the intention to grab his property worth lakhs of rupees.        
	A retired employee of the Indian postal department, Pandey also has five acres along the old Patna Bypass Road. The widower had adopted Anil, who was married to Nutan, Pradip Pandey and Indu Devis daughter. The couple was blessed with a girl child. However, Anil died a couple of years ago.         
	Nutan then tied the knot with another man and left Pandeys home leaving behind the daughter.         
	I wanted to donate my property to charities that work in the education field, Pandey told the police, added: Indu Devi, the mother of my former daughter-in-law, however, wanted me to leave the property to their family.         
	Police suspect that Indu Devi in collusion with relatives and tenants kept Pandey. Bablu, a tenant for six years, had stopped paying rent about two years ago and on being asked either to pay up or vacate, he reportedly threatened to kill Pandey.         
	R.K. Mishra, the inspector of Khaje Kala police station, said that Pandey, who was weakened by his captivity, is being guarded by the police. The officers, however, are yet to arrest any of the accused, who are said to be absconding.        
	Recently, an eight year old was allegedly kidnapped by his neighbours, Avinash, 13, and Khursheed, 14, who admittedly sodomised the teenager and then killed him in Kankarbagh area. Police arrested Avinash and Khursheed yesterday, who later confessed to their crime.

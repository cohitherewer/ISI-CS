	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 7: As reports of swine flu cases spread through Sundergarh district, chief minister Naveen Patnaik today stressed on the need for an awareness drive at a meeting chaired by him.        
	Five girls of a Kanyashram at Jhanipalli under Rajgangpur block area have tested positive for H1N1 while two more from nearby Tudalaga school also have been affected.         
	So far, one swine flu death has been reported in the state, while 16 have been tested positive.         
	Chairing a meeting to take stock of the situation, especially in Sundergarh, Naveen asked revenue divisional commissioners, district collectors and chief district medical officers to keep a close watch and advised health officials to take precautionary measures in border areas.         
	It was decided to impart daylong training to Accredited Social Health Activists and anganwadi workers at districts to sensitise them about symptoms.         
	Besides, district welfare officers, social welfare officers and welfare extension officers will also be sensitised.        
	The state has a stock of 3-lakh Tamiflu tablets in the hospitals and a consignment of another 3 lakh tablets will be in the state soon, said the officials talking to Naveen today. Other provisions include treatment at 39 health centres across the state, including government medical colleges and district headquarter hospitals.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 5: Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan has issued a showcause notice to Punjab and Haryana High Court judge Nirmal Yadav, asking her why action shouldnt be taken against her for misconduct.         
	Yadav is one of the judges whose names surfaced in connection with the cash-at-door scandal in Chandigarh last year.         
	Around Rs 15 lakh in cash was delivered at the city residence of another judge, Justice Nirmaljit Kaur, who called police.         
	State additional advocate-general Sanjeev Bansal later claimed that the money was meant for another lady judge, Justice Nirmal Yadav, and it was mistakenly delivered at Kaurs residence.         
	The chief justices notice is said to be based on a report filed by a three-member panel of high court judges. The CBI is also holding a parallel probe.         
	Yadav had said she was innocent. But the judge had said she, along with 17 others, had bought properties at Solan, Himachal, with the help of a Delhi businessman and a real estate dealer.

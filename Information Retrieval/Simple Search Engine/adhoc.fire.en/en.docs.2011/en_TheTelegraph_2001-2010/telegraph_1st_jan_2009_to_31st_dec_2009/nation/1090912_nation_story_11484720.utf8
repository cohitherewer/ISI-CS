	New Delhi, Sept. 11: The government has decided to treat couples who have adopted a child on a par with natural parents while granting maternity and paternity leave.         
	The government will grant six months maternity leave to a woman employee and 15 days paternity leave to a male employee.         
	During leave, the adoptive mothers salary will be equal to that drawn immediately before going on leave. The benefit will not be available to an adoptive mother who has two surviving children at the time of adoption.

	Excerpts of President Barack Obamas Nobel Peace Prize speech in which he mentioned war 44 times        
	The controversy first        
	I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the considerable controversy that your generous decision has generated. In part, this is because I am at the beginning, and not the end, of my labours on the world stage.         
	Compared to some of the giants of history who have received this prize  Schweitzer and King; Marshall and Mandela  my accomplishments are slight.        
	Commander-in-chief        
	But perhaps the most profound issue surrounding my receipt of this prize is the fact that I am the Commander-in-chief of a nation in the midst of two wars. One of these wars is winding down. The other is a conflict that America did not seek; one in which we are joined by forty three other countries  including Norway  in an effort to defend ourselves and all nations from further attacks.... I come here with an acute sense of the cost of armed conflict  filled with difficult questions about the relationship between war and peace, and our effort to replace one with the other.        
	The ideals        
	Yes, terrible wars have been fought, and atrocities committed. But there has been no Third World War. The Cold War ended with jubilant crowds dismantling a wall. Commerce has stitched much of the world together. Billions have been lifted from poverty. The ideals of liberty, self-determination, equality and the rule of law have haltingly advanced. We are the heirs of the fortitude and foresight of generations past, and it is a legacy for which my own country is rightfully proud.

	Gandhi parallel        
	We must begin by acknowledging the hard truth that we will not eradicate violent conflict in our lifetimes. There will be times when nations  acting individually or in concert  will find the use of force not only necessary but morally justified.        
	As someone who stands here as a direct consequence of Dr (Martin Luther) Kings lifes work, I am living testimony to the moral force of non-violence. I know there is nothing weak, nothing passive, nothing naive in the creed and lives of Gandhi and King.        
	But as a head of state sworn to protect and defend my nation, I cannot be guided by their examples alone. I face the world as it is, and cannot stand idle in the face of threats to the American people. For make no mistake: evil does exist in the world. A non-violent movement could not have halted Hitlers armies. Negotiations cannot convince al Qaidas leaders to lay down their arms. To say that force is sometimes necessary is not a call to cynicism  it is a recognition of history; the imperfections of man and the limits of reason.        
	Attainable peace        
	Whatever mistakes we have made, the plain fact is this: the United States of America has helped underwrite global security for more than six decades with the blood of our citizens and the strength of our arms. The service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform has promoted peace and prosperity from Germany to Korea, and enabled democracy to take hold in places like the Balkans. We have borne this burden not because we seek to impose our will. We have done so out of enlightened self-interest  because we seek a better future for our children and grandchildren, and we believe that their lives will be better if other peoples children and grandchildren can live in freedom and prosperity.        
	So yes, the instruments of war do have a role to play in preserving the peace. And yet this truth must coexist with another  that no matter how justified, war promises human tragedy.         
	The soldiers courage and sacrifice is full of glory, expressing devotion to country, to cause and to comrades in arms. But war itself is never glorious, and we must never trumpet it as such.        
	So part of our challenge is reconciling these two seemingly irreconcilable truths that war is sometimes necessary, and war is at some level an expression of human feelings.         
	Concretely, we must direct our effort to the task that President Kennedy called for long ago. Let us focus, he said, on a more practical, more attainable peace, based not on a sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in human institutions.

	Multilateral approach        
	What might this evolution look like? What might these practical steps be?         
	To begin with, I believe that all nations  strong and weak alike  must adhere to standards that govern the use of force. I, like any head of state, reserve the right to act unilaterally if necessary to defend my nation. Nevertheless, I am convinced that adhering to standards strengthens those who do, and isolates and weakens those who dont.        
	War for peace        
	I believe that force can be justified on humanitarian grounds, as it was in the Balkans, or in other places that have been scarred by war. Inaction tears at our conscience and can lead to more costly intervention later. That is why all responsible nations must embrace the role that militaries with a clear mandate can play to keep the peace.        
	But in a world in which threats are more diffuse, and missions more complex, America cannot act alone. This is true in Afghanistan. This is true in failed states like Somalia, where terrorism and piracy is joined by famine and human suffering. And sadly, it will continue to be true in unstable regions for years to come.        
	But in many countries, there is a disconnect between the efforts of those who serve and the ambivalence of the broader public. I understand why war is not popular. But I also know this: the belief that peace is desirable is rarely enough to achieve it. Peace requires responsibility. Peace entails sacrifice.... That is why we must strengthen UN and regional peacekeeping, and not leave the task to a few countries.         
	Let me make one final point about the use of force. Even as we make difficult decisions about going to war, we must also think clearly about how we fight it. The Nobel Committee recognised this truth in awarding its first prize for peace to Henry Dunant  the founder of the Red Cross, and a driving force behind the Geneva Conventions.        
	The nuclear question        
	One urgent example is the effort to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, and to seek a world without them.         
	In the middle of the last century, nations agreed to be bound by a treaty whose bargain is clear: all will have access to peaceful nuclear power; those without nuclear weapons will forsake them; and those with nuclear weapons will work toward disarmament.         
	I am committed to upholding this treaty. It is a centrepiece of my foreign policy. And I am working with President Medvedev to reduce America and Russias nuclear stockpiles.         
	Final word        
	Somewhere today, in this world, a young protester awaits the brutality of her government, but has the courage to march on. Somewhere today, a mother facing punishing poverty still takes the time to teach her child, who believes that a cruel world still has a place for his dreams.        
	Let us live by their example. We can acknowledge that oppression will always be with us, and still strive for justice. We can admit the intractability of depravation, and still strive for dignity. We can understand that there will be war, and still strive for peace. We can do that, for that is the story of human progress. That is the hope of all the world, and at this moment of challenge, that must be our work here on Earth.

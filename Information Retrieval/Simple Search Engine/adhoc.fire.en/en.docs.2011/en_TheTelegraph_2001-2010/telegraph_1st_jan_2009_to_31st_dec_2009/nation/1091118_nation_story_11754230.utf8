	Ahmednagar, Nov. 17 (PTI): The chairman of two-wheeler company Kinetic, Arun Firodia, and a local Shiv Sena MLA have lodged complaints against each other after a labourer dispute in the plant.        
	Police inspector V.M. Pawar said according to Firodias complaint, MLA Anil Rathod and his party workers threatened him when he was going to Pune, broke the windowpanes of his car, beat him up and snatched his gold chain.        
	Rathod has alleged in his counter-complaint that the Kinetic chairman threatened to get the Sena supporters killed by contract hit men if they interfered in the companys affairs.         
	The MLA has also complained to the police that Firodia snatched his gold chain and beat him and his party workers.        
	According to the Sena, the company suspended 36 employees recently. Kinetic, however, has maintained that the 36 employees have been given alternative jobs.        
	Reacting to the dispute as unfortunate, the Maratha Chamber of Commerce and Industries said the issue could be settled through talks. Its vice-president, Prakash Gandhi, said such incidents could hamper functioning of industries in the area.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Riots scar on EU travel advisory
                                                                                                               Riots scar on EU travel advisory
                              Not safe? A church in Kandhamal                            
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 29 (PTI): Last years riots in Kandhamal still casts a shadow over Orissa with a recent travel advisory by the European Union asking its citizens to avoid Kandhamal and Bargarh districts.        
	We have tried our best to convince European tour operators, but they showed us the advisory, Orissa Tour Operators Association leader Srikant Mishra said. Europeans are not interested in visiting Orissa because of the last years communal violence, he added.        
	High-end tourists from Italy, Netherlands, Belgium and other countries were afraid of visiting Orissa for no specific reason, he said and demanded that the state government intervene immediately.        
	Tourism minister Debi Prasad Mishra, on his part, said: We will certainly take steps to ensure the visit of European tourists to the state.        
	The EU, in its August 17 advisory, claimed that religious tension between the Hindu majority and Christian minority, still remained high. We therefore advise against travel within the state and in rural areas, particularly in the districts of Kandhamal and Bargarh, it said.        
	The EU issued the advisory even though diplomats, comprising British high commissions second secretary Ruth Wills, Italian embassy first secretary Gabriele Annis, Irish embassy deputy head of mission Pat Bourne, Netherlands embassy second secretary Bart Paans and Finland embassy deputy head of mission Lissa Valijento, visited the state last year.        
	The EU team members had then expressed satisfaction over the improved situation in the state, a senior home department official said. There is no violence in Kandhamal since October 2008. The people celebrated Christmas and New Years Day as peace returned to the tribal dominated district, Kandhamal superintendent of police Praveen Kumar told PTI.        
	The EUs advisory came at a time when the state government was targeting the visit of 2 lakh foreign tourists to Orissa, said Mishra of the tour operators association.        
	While there was a fall in the number of foreign tourists to Orissa, the state government claimed that 40,000 foreigners visited it last year. We do not believe in the governments claim, said a tour operator. Foreign tourists were mostly interested in Orissas culture, its forests, wildlife and people, he said.        
	The state had witnessed large-scale violence in the aftermath of the killing of VHP leader Swami Laxmananda Saraswati in August last year.

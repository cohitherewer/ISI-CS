The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sena finds a new Jinnah in Raj
                                                                                                               Sena finds a new Jinnah in Raj
          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                              Raj and Bal Thackeray				                                 
	Mumbai, Sept. 30: Bal Thackeray may have just handed his rivals the perfect excuse to call him Jinnahs uncle.        
	An editorial purportedly written by the Shiv Sena boss in party mouthpiece Saamna appeared to brand his estranged nephew Raj Thackeray as the new Mohammed Ali Jinnah.        
	The sobriquet  at a time the J-word has become a calling card for controversy  betrays Sena concerns that Rajs Maharashtra Navnirman Sena would split Marathi votes in the October 13 elections and help the Congress-NCP alliance return to power for a third consecutive term.        
	The British incited Jinnah and forced him to divide India. Now a new Jinnah at home is dividing Marathi people, the editorial published this morning said.        
	The joint Sena-BJP manifesto the allies released on Sunday had made the same point, too, asking people not to waste their precious votes on the MNS as such a division would help the ruling Congress-NCP return to power.        
	The editorial also attacked the Congress for encouraging Raj, a charge chief minister Ashok Chavan denied yesterday.  their politics is worse than that of the Muslim League. The League at least openly demanded Pakistan by dividing India. The Congress is also using this Jinnah to divide Marathi people, the editorial said, alluding to Raj whom the Sena has dubbed a spoiler.        
	Hours later, Saamna executive editor and senior leader Sanjay Raut repeated the Jinnah remark at a campaign speech. Raj divided Marathi votes in the Lok Sabha elections, and he is still doing the same. Thats why we call him Jinnah, Raut said.        
	Rajs three-year-old MNS had turned in an impressive performance in the May elections. Although it contested just 12 of the 48 seats, MNS candidates polled over a lakh votes in nine of them, including all six in Mumbai.        
	The division of votes between the MNS and the Sena helped the Congress sweep all the six seats in Mumbai, one more than its 2004 tally in the city. For the coming state polls, the MNS has fielded candidates in 144 of the 288 seats.        
	Raj hasnt yet reacted to the editorial, but MNS spokesperson Shirish Parkar said the childish criticism showed that the ground was slipping from under the Senas feet.        
	It is well known that Saamna editorials are written on orders of (Thackerays son) Uddhav Thackeray. The editorials have no connection with Balasaheb, Parkar added.        
	But the article has certainly served on a platter the perfect campaign punch to Congress and NCP slogan writers.        
	Its another matter whether anyone would dare to call Bal Thackeray Jinnahs uncle.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 14: The government has woken up after 24 years to pay compensation to the family members of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots.        
	Sources here said a high-level committee had been constituted by the government, headed by the special secretary of home department to monitor the payment of compensation.        
	Funds to the tune of Rs 44 lakh have been released by the finance department for this. The compensation would be paid on the basis of rules framed by the Centre in 2006, added sources.         
	According to the information available with the home department, three persons from Orissa were killed and more than 25 others were injured in the riots. Hundreds of houses were damaged too.        
	Sundargarh district was worst hit by the riot with two victims and all the injured people and affected families belonging to it.         
	Only one person from Khurda district was killed.        
	The family members of all the three victims were paid a compensation of Rs 3.5 lakh each. However, the injured persons are yet to get compensation. Each injured person is entitled to a compensation of Rs 1.25 lakh. If any injured person has received any assistance earlier, the amount would be deducted from his dues. Similarly, as per the revised rules of 2006, those families whose houses had been damaged during the riots would get 10 times of the house building assistance they were paid earlier.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Not flying high                                  
	Mumbai, Sept. 23: Loss-making Air India today decided to cut by 25 to 50 per cent a key salary incentive as part of a cost-cutting plan it needs to push through to win a government bailout.        
	The slash in the productivity-linked incentive (PLI) will affect close to 7,000 of the airlines 31,000 employees, including pilots, cabin crew and executives. It will be applicable for the incentives payable from August. The incentive accounts for up to 30 per cent of the salaries.        
	The cuts, cleared by the state-owned airlines board at its meeting here, are expected to take the carrier closer to its targeted annual savings of around Rs 800 crore.        
	The incentive costs the airline around Rs 1,400 crore each year. Analysts said a flat 50 per cent would have lowered the amount to Rs 700 crore, but the cuts announced today are not uniform across ranks. The airlines accumulated losses were around Rs 7,200 crore on March 31 this year.        
	There was no reaction from the airlines unions to the reductions, which come weeks after Jet Airways pilots, protesting sackings over moves to form a union, went on mass sick leave. Although they resumed duty after a few days, the private airline is said to have taken a Rs 40-crore hit.        
	In a statement released after todays board meeting, Air India said the incentive slash would apply to all officers, including the top management.        
	The cut will be 25 per cent for those getting an incentive of Rs 10,000 or less per month. It will be 50 per cent for those getting an incentive of Rs 2 lakh or more per month.        
	The cut will be 35 per cent on incentives of Rs 10,001 to Rs 25,000, 40 per cent on Rs 25,001 to Rs 50,000 and 45 per cent on Rs 50,001 to Rs 2 lakh, the airline said.        
	The statement didnt explicitly say that the cuts will cover cabin crew and pilots but sources said they would also get the reduced incentives.        
	Todays slash is based on the report of a committee, headed by a senior airline director. The panel was constituted after an earlier plan to slash the incentives by 50 per cent met with strong opposition from employee unions.        
	The Air India board accepted the recommendation of the committee, headed by Anup Srivastava, director (personnel), which had been asked to review the incentive, the statement said.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had recently reviewed the airlines turnaround strategy. But he was believed to have indicated that any help would only come after cost cutting. The airline wants a Rs 5,000-crore bailout.        
	A meeting of secretaries last month said the Centre had agreed to invest more in the airlines shares or offer other forms of financial assistance only if it undertook measures to bring down costs and improve revenues.

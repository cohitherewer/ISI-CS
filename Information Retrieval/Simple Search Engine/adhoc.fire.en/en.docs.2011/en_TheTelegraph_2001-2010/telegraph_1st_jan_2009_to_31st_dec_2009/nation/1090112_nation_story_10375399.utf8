          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Villagers protest the Posco project. File picture                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 11: The Orissa government recommended the Centre to grant prospecting licence for Khandadhar iron ore mines in favour of south Korean steel major Posco for its proposed $12 billion steel plant to be set up near Paradip.        
	Confirming this, state steel and mines secretary Ashok Dalwai said the recommendation letter to this effect had been sent to the Union mines ministry on Friday.        
	Dalwai said the government chose Posco from among more than 200 applicants for prospecting licence over an area of 2,500 hectares in Khandadhar in Sundargarh district, as it was found most suitable.        
	This was for the second time Naveen Patnaik state government recommended for the prospecting licence of Khandadhar mines in favour of Posco. The government had earlier recommended for grant of prospecting licence to Posco for about 6,000 acres of Khandadhar iron ore mines. However, it was challenged by many other companies, including PSU Kudremukh Iron Ore Limited and private companies like Jindal Photo Limited, Jindal Strips Limited and Bhusan Power and Steel Limited for ignoring their claims. The Union mines ministry and the Supreme Court had directed the government to hear all the applications and then recommend the name for the prospecting licence.        
	Subsequently, the government heard all 227 applications and finally chose Posco for the prospecting licence for the contentious Khandadhar iron ore mines.        
	The recommendation by the government for a prospecting licence for three years was a part of its commitment to ensure provision of raw material  it had been estimated that 600 million tonnes of iron ore would be required by the plant for 30 years  to the south Korean steel maker Posco, which had signed an MoU in June 2005 to set up a 12MTPA steel plant near Paradip.        
	The project had hit a roadblock because of problem in land acquisition and delay in grant of iron ore mines. While the oustees at proposed project site in Jagatsinghpur district carried out a sustained agitation opposing land acquisition, environmentalists and local leaders of BJP and CPM vehemently opposed the hand over of Khandadhar mines on the ground that it would spell environmental disaster. Khandadhar hills range is a major tourist attraction for its two waterfalls.        
	On the other hand, over 20,000 inhabitants of 15 nearby villages have been protesting the mining project saying that they would be deprived of their home and livelihood.         
	BJP national vice-president and former Union tribal affairs minister Juel Oram, who represents the area in Lok Sabha and has been opposing the project since its beginning, said the protest movement would continue and people would not allow mining at any cost.        
	However, the state governments move of recommending for prospecting licence has come as a major boost to the Posco project, which had been delayed because of mines lease and land delay. The company was eagerly waiting for the mines lease. Last month, Posco India chief Shung Sik Cho had said here that construction of the plant would start after getting raw material linkage.

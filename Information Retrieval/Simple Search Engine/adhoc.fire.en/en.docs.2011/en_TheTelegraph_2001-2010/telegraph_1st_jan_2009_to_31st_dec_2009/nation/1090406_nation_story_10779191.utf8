  - Find out if UGC inspected institute campus   Ask if tech course was approved by AICTE										      CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                           
	New, Delhi, April 5: A weak higher education regulatory mechanism is increasingly leaving students to fend for themselves as they navigate through a minefield of false claims and suggestions by institutions in advertisements.        
	The governments inability to act against a spate of such advertisements in national dailies over the past week is forcing top education administrators to accept gaping loopholes in regulations as students head into the 2009 admission season.         
	A concerned human resource development ministry and a perplexed University Grants Commission have received several complaints over the past week but are struggling to tackle claims that could lead students into substandard courses and institutions.         
	The problem is that the claims, despite being inaccurate, are not automatically illegal or punishable under law.        
	Repeated advertisements are appearing in print and on television where a private university claims it is rated the best in its category, and that it is recognised by the UGC  the countrys apex higher education regulator.        
	In reality, the UGC has never even inspected the university and its officials say they are physically prevented by the varsity from examining its claims.        
	Technically, the university is empowered at present to claim that it is recognised by the UGC, as Delhi High Court has ruled in its favour in a case against the UGC.         
	But the UGC has appealed against the judgment and does not recognise degrees offered by the university, effectively making them illegal. A student entering the university may find the degree he or she is awarded has no validity.        
	A separate private university that offers engineering and other technical courses advertised on Friday in several newspapers that it is approved by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE).         
	The HRD ministry has written to the UGC suggesting it issue a public notice clarifying that only one of nine courses offered by this university is approved by the AICTE. But its officials admit they cannot take any punitive action under law.         
	So what should students do?         
	Government officials suggest that the best strategy at present for students to avoid falling for false claims is to ask a set of two simple questions.         
	Several private institutions are truly among the best in our country. But students must be able to sieve the wheat from the chaff, a senior HRD ministry official responsible for higher education said.         
	The UGC does not recognise universities, which are created by an act of Parliament or a law passed in a state legislature. The UGC does, however, grant deemed-to-be university status.        
	All universities and deemed universities, however, require the UGC to approve their courses and overall quality since a 2005 Supreme Court judgment that declared a slew of private universities in Chhattisgarh illegal. Some of those private universities were running from garages and sheds.        
	So students, officials say, must ask any private university whether the UGC has inspected its campus, facilities and courses and approved these, before seeking admission.        
	If students find the university evasive in answering, they must call up the UGC and crosscheck the universitys antecedents, a top UGC administrator said.         
	The AICTE  the regulator of engineering and management education, possibly the most popular courses at present  does not recognise institutions. It only approves individual courses. So any claim by an institution that it is approved, affiliated or recognised by the AICTE must be false, an AICTE official explained.        
	Students seeking admission to any engineering or management course should specifically ask the institution whether that course is approved by the AICTE, the official said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Revolt hint from Jaswant
                                                                                                               Revolt hint from Jaswant
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Jaswant Singh                                  
	New Delhi, June 10: Senior BJP leader Jaswant Singh virtually raised a banner of revolt against colleagues L.K. Advani and Arun Jaitley in a meeting of the partys core committee today.        
	The Darjeeling MP circulated a one-page note at the meeting in which he called for a parity between inam (reward) and parinaam (result).        
	Apart from Advani and Jaitley, those who attended the meeting included Murli Manohar Joshi, M. Venkaiah Naidu, Rajnath Singh Sushma Swaraj and Ananth Kumar.        
	The note was promptly handed back to Jaswant for fear that the media might lay their hands on it. But news leaked soon after, setting off a buzz on what Jaswant might have meant.        
	The general interpretation was Jaswant had vented his ire against the appointment of Advani and Jaitley as Opposition leaders in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, passing up veterans like himself and Joshi, who also won a hard-fought battle from Varanasi.        
	BJP sources said Jaswant prefaced his note by saying that he had put his views in writing as he might not be able to say exactly what I mean.        
	When Jaswant demanded a free and frank discussion on the BJPs rout in the Lok Sabha polls, Rajnath reportedly promised an introspection session would be held shortly.        
	The BJP chief also said a three-member team would be set up to look into the causes of the defeat.        
	Sources said the BJP had reconciled itself to Advanis re-anointment but the pitch against Jaitley was becoming shriller by the day.        
	In a meeting of the BJP parliamentary party yesterday, another veteran, Arun Shourie, had questioned the propriety of Jaitley and Advanis political aide Sudheendra Kulkarni commenting about the partys showing in different publications.        
	Sources said Rajya Sabha MP Shourie began by saying Jaitley and Kulkarni were good friends of his, but went on to question if it had been proper of them to analyse the poll verdict before the party formulated its position.        
	In an article, Kulkarni had blamed the RSS for making a strong leader like Advani look weak, helpless and not fully in command. He then recommended that the Sangh take tips from the way Sonia Gandhi and Rahul made an essentially weak PM like Manmohan Singh look strong by backing him solidly.        
	In another publication, Jaitley had said there was a surge in favour of the Congress and Manmohans image had created a sense of sympathy, that a man who wanted to deliver was being obstructed from proceeding further principally by the Left.        
	He did not mention the BJPs obstructive role in Parliament but said: Sober governance helps, shrillness does not. Moderation and understatement are virtues.        
	The BJP, including Advani, distanced itself from Kulkarnis stand. Joshi supported Jaswant today.

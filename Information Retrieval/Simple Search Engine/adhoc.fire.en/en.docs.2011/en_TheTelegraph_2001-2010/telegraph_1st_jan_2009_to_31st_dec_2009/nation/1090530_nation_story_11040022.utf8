          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Azharuddin and Rubina                                  
	Mumbai, May 29: The child actors of Slumdog Millionaire now have more than one house to choose from.        
	Today, Ashok Chavan sanctioned two tenements of the Maharashtra Housing and Development Authority (Mhada) for Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail and Rubina Ali from his chief ministers quota.        
	On May 14, the homes of the children in Garib Nagar slum colony, near Bandra station, were razed as part of a pre-monsoon drive.        
	Slumdog director Danny Boyle and producer Christian Colson came to their rescue on Wednesday. Their Jai Ho Trust announced it would allot rented flats to Azharuddin and Rubina. Boyle said the trust would later purchase  the houses cost Rs 25 lakh each  in their names.        
	Now, the Mumbai Congress has offered to pay the cost of the government tenements that cost Rs 4 lakh each.        
	However, Mhada chairman Amarjit Singh Manhas said the children would not be given the tenements if they opted for the Jai Ho Trusts flats.        
	They cant have both options. The government scheme is for homeless people. If they accept the trusts flats, then Mhada flats will not be allotted, he said.

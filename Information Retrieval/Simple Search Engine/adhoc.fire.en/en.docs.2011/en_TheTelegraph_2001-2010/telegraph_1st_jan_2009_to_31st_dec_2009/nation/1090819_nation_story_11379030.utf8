The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rap on PSC officials
                                                                                                               Rap on PSC officials
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 18: The Supreme Court has upheld the summary suspension of a public service commission chairman and eight other members, accused of misconduct and financial bungling, saying such panels should have people of irreproachable integrity.        
	For the efficient functioning of a democracy, it is imperative that the public service commissions are manned by people of the highest skill and of irreproachable integrity so that the selections to various public posts can be immunised from all sorts of extraneous factors like political pressure or favouritism and are made solely on considerations of merit, the court said yesterday.        
	The bench, headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, upheld the August 2008 decision of the Haryana governor to suspend the chairman and eight members of the state public service commission. Haryana Public Service Commission chairman Ram Kumar Pandey and the eight others had sought quashing of the governors order.        
	The officials said they deserved a notice and a hearing. But the court didnt accept the argument and cited an earlier judgment that said chairpersons or members of such commissions couldnt be equated with public servants.        
	The bench clarified that since public service commissions were created under Article 315 of the Constitution, the rules of dismissal applicable for regular government employees could not be extended to them.         
	The rationale behind empowering the governor to issue summary suspension orders is to maintain public trust and confidence in the service commissions, the court said.

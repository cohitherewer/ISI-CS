          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, June 4: A 48-year-old farmer in East Midnapore killed himself today, allegedly because a government embargo was coming in the way of selling a part of his land to marry off his daughter.        
	Samir Parui hanged himself from the bamboo frame of his tiled-roof house in Kulberia, Tamluk, about 100km from Calcutta.        
	Samirs wife Ujjala said he couldnt sell a part of his 1-bigha (20 cottah) plot because the government, which decided to acquire 110 acres (330 bighas) to construct offices, had imposed a freeze on buying and selling land in Kulberia and another village, Srikrishnapur.        
	My husband was becoming frustrated as he was not being able to sell his land because of the government order, she said. He met the district magistrate several times but didnt get any assurance from the administration.        
	District magistrate C.D. Lama dismissed suggestions that Samirs land, beside the Calcutta-Haldia road, was behind the suicide. We dont think the suicide has got anything to do with land. He didnt leave any suicide note behind.        
	A senior district official said the government could impose restrictions on buying and selling land under the land acquisition act.         
	If the ban was part of the reason behind the suicide, the standoff over the rate of compensation for some of the plots acquired  including Samirs 1.5 cottah  had left him frustrated.        
	For the 21 acres it acquired in 2008  89 acres had already been acquired in 2007  the government had offered Rs 72,000 for every cottah (60 cottahs make an acre), but the villagers demanded Rs 1 lakh.        
	Samirs elder brother Srikanta said the market price of land in the neighbourhood had gone up to Rs 1.5 lakh a cottah. So why shouldnt we demand at least Rs 1 lakh?        
	Lama said the administration had in February asked the farmers to agree to the offer. But they wouldnt listen.        
	On the embargo, the DM said: If the farmers approach us for permission to buy or sell land, we will consider it.

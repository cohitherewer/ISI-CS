The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Village on eviction drive

  - Crackdown on Bangladeshis worries Bengalis        ANANYA SENGUPTA                          Old Usmanpur residents with papers showing Indian citizenship, (right) village head Ram Singh. (Prem Singh)                                        
	New Delhi, Jan. 14: An east Delhi village has decided to make it its business to evict Bangladeshis living here illegally.        
	We had a maha panchayat some months back and all of us decided these people must go. I am not saying I want all of them kicked out. We want all those illegal migrants who have no valid proof of being Indians or a valid visa to leave, said Chaudhary Ram Singh, the head of Old Usmanpur village.         
	Out of around 2,000 residents in the mainly Gujjar village, over 500 are Bengali-speaking and live close together in shanties.         
	The rest of the villagers now plan to ask their Bengali-speaking neighbours, who work mostly as rag-pickers or rickshaw-pullers, for the documents on the basis of which they claim to be Indian.         
	We have already sent complaints and if they dont leave by themselves, then we have decided to draft another set of complaint letters. We will also help police verify all of them and make sure that they go. Most of these people, who work as ragpickers here, come with a visa thats valid for 2-3 months and stay on forever, Singh added.        
	P. Chidambaram would be pleased with the effort. A Bangladeshi has no business to come to India unless he has a visa. He has no business to live here unless he has a residence permit. He has no business to work here unless he has a work permit, the home minister told a TV channel this week.        
	This village had decided to act much before Chidambaram spoke  right after Delhi police said they suspected Bangladeshi militants to be behind the Mehrauli market blast last September. A boy was killed when he picked up a bag dropped by two bikers and ran after them to return it, not knowing it contained a bomb.        
	While safety is a concern, another reason the Gujjars want the Bangladeshis out is because they grudge their competing claim on income sources and facilities provided by the government.         
	After the floods in August-September, the city administration distributed relief material here. They got the bulk of the benefits as they have erected shanties along the road. Tenant verification is not done properly as policemen are bribed. There have been many instances when policemen visited the area after our complaints but did not take any action, said Biram Singh, a villager.        
	But this crackdown on Bangladeshis has a group in the village  the Bengalis  worried. We speak the same language, we even look like them, so the cops pick us up, harass and abuse us. We show them our voters identity card and other documents and still they arent convinced. What else can we do? They release us only when we pay Rs 1,000-2,000. Now when they are under pressure to get Bangladeshis, we Bengalis invariably become their targets, says Nuresh, who shows off documents to back his claim of being a native of Malda.

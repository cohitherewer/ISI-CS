          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Thiruvananthapuram, Sept. 30: Kerala High Court today asked the Centre and the state police to report within three weeks the activities of a jihadi outfit accused of luring non-Muslim girls and converting them.        
	The Union home ministry and state director-general of police have been told to investigate Love Jihad, an offshoot of the pro-Muslim Popular Front of India, its spread, sources of funding and possible links with terror groups, smugglers and drug rackets.         
	Another such outfit, going by the name Jihadi Romeos, is also said to be under the scanner, though the court order didnt explicitly mention it.        
	The probe order came as the court rejected anticipatory bail pleas of two suspected Love Jihad activists. Two girls, both MBA students, told the court that the duo had feigned love, offered to marry them but coerced them to convert.         
	The police have also been asked to report on the alleged conversions in the states schools and colleges in the past three years.        
	Earlier, a special police team was set up to probe charges that jihadis were luring girls on campuses and converting them with the intention of using them for anti-national activities.

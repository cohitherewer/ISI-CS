	New Delhi, Nov. 18: Police on Monday arrested five members of a gang that targeted homes of government employees in south Delhi, robbed them and set them on fire.         
	The houses were torched to erase fingerprints and keep sniffer dogs off their trail, the police said.        
	The gang picked locked homes, sew off window grilles, usually at the back of the houses, to enter and cleaned out jewellery, electronics goods and cash.        
	The police recovered eight laptops, a handy-cam, two mobile phones, four imported watches, a CD player, a telescopic engineering instrument, jewellery, silverware and $300 from the gang.

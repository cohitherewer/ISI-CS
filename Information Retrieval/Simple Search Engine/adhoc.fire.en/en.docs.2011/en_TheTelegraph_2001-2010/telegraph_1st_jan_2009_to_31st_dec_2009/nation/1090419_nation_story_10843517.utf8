The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Betrayer threatens to steal Sena trophy
                                                                                                               Betrayer threatens to steal Sena trophy
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI IN RATNAGIRI                                          
	The irony of Narayan Ranes speech, accusing the BJP-Shiv Sena combine of creating communal- and caste-based divides, doesnt escape 47-year-old dhaba waiter Shabbir Alam.        
	The last time the country went to Lok Sabha polls, Rane was spouting venom against the Congress for alleged minority appeasement, making no effort to hide that he couldnt care for any Muslim votes.        
	But times have changed. Rane, then among the Shiv Senas tallest leaders, is now with the Congress, and the Sena is fighting a battle for survival in what it had nurtured into a seemingly impregnable bastion.        
	One of its most popular leaders, former Union minister Suresh Prabhu, is pitted against Ranes son Nilesh Rane here. It is a bid to galvanise cadres yet to fully come to terms with Ranes betrayal, a senior Sena leader said from Mumbai.                  
	The Konkan region, a picturesque coastal strip sandwiched between the Western Ghats and the Arabian Sea, consists of the Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Raigad and Thane districts. It technically includes Mumbai but all political parties treat the megapolis separately from the rest of Konkan, though the politics of one has often impacted the other.        
	At the Sena party office in Ratnagiri, the political nerve centre of the Konkan region, leaders make no attempt to hide either their disgust with Rane, or their fear that he may steal their trophy.        
	But they say they will fight tooth and nail. We may win or we may lose. But we will do whatever we can to teach Rane a lesson, a senior Sena leader of Ratnagiri district said.        
	Although Rane was the pivot around which the Sena built itself in Konkan, the party used its successful years to dig deep roots in the region.        
	Engineering student Tuhin Prabhu and bus conductor Sunil Bhonsle blamed Rane for breaking the Sena.        
	The Sena saved lives. What has Rane done since moving to the Congress? asked Bhonsle.        
	He was alluding to the mobile hospital vans that the Sena runs in Mumbai and across the Konkan region.         
	In successive Assembly polls starting 1995, the Sena all but swept the region, leaving barely one or two seats for the Congress.        
	In the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, the Congress won five of the six seats in Mumbai, but the Sena managed to win three of the other four Konkan seats as consolation.        
	A.R. Antulay won for the Congress from the Kolaba seat that has now been renamed Raigad. Antulay went on to become minority affairs minister, showed little interest in ministerial work but transformed himself into a controversial figure by questioning the authenticity of the encounter with terrorists in Mumbai on November 26.         
	Nominated by the Congress to contest the Raigad seat this time, Antulay protested, citing opposition from within the local party unit to his candidature.        
	But earlier this week, the Congress expelled three MLAs for protesting against Antulay, and the veteran is contesting against senior Sena leader Anant Geete, the sitting MP from Ratnagiri.        
	The real battle for Konkan will, however, be fought here in Ratnagiri, say leaders of both the Congress and the Sena. Following delimitation, Konkan has lost one seat  Rajapur, won by the Sena last time  to the urban settlements around Mumbai.        
	Rane, picked by Balasaheb Thackeray to build the partys fortunes in Konkan, has repeatedly taken unilateral credit for the Senas dominance over the region.         
	According to his aides, it is natural that with his switch to the Congress  he also frisked away other top Sena leaders from Konkan with him  the panja (Hand) will emerge more powerful than it has ever been in recent times here.        
	It is that confidence in persona over politics that Rane showed when, at a sabha in Chiplun in Ratnagiri district yesterday, he attacked the BJP-Sena combine for religion-based politics he too once indulged in.        
	That the Congress believes that it needs him desperately was revealed by the manner in which it re-inducted him shortly after dismissing him last year for rebelling against the party high command  normally an unpardonable crime in the Congress.        
	Rane had called a news conference to protest against being ignored for the post of chief minister after Vilasrao Deshmukh quit following the Mumbai terror strikes.         
	Was the Congress over-indulgent towards Rane? Or is one man really capable of bringing down a bastion he helped create?        
	No one, neither politicians nor ordinary folk here, is willing to hedge bets either way yet because the battle is close, but perhaps also because its significance is not lost on them.        
	Simply put, the answers could reshape Maharashtra politics.

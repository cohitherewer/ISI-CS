The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Fine amp; jail stick for errant institutes   Penalty for false claims: Rs 50 lakh
                                                                                                               Fine amp; jail stick for errant institutes
   Penalty for false claims: Rs 50 lakh          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                                   
	New Delhi, Sept. 1: Management officials running higher education institutions may soon face punishment of up to Rs 50 lakh as fine and a three-year jail term for misleading students with false claims and promises or charging capitation fees.         
	The Centre will for the first time initiate criminal proceedings against officials at private institutions who cheat students, under a promised law to penalise unfair educational practices, top government officials told The Telegraph.         
	The punishment listed in the draft Prohibition of Unfair Practices in Technical, Medical Educational Institutions and Universities Bill is unprecedented in Indias education system  both in terms of its nature and quantity.         
	The bill, drafted by the human resource development ministry, has been circulated to all state governments for comments. HRD ministry sources said they hoped to introduce the bill in the next session of Parliament.         
	The legislation follows piles of complaints received by the HRD ministry and its regulatory agencies that private institutions were cheating students with false claims and promises.         
	Despite a Supreme Court ban on charging capitation fees, the practice of seeking donation fees in addition to admission charges for seats in private professional educational institutions is rampant, especially in southern India.         
	At present, India does not have any legal framework to punish educational institutions that mislead students with false promises or claims. There is also no prescribed penalty for charging capitation fees, despite the Supreme Court ban.         
	Soon after taking over as HRD minister, Kapil Sibal met senior ministry officials to discuss plans for a legal mechanism to punish institutions cheating students with false and misleading claims.         
	The Telegraph was the first to report on June 15 plans for legal teeth for the HRD ministry to tackle such institutions.         
	The draft bill now details the structure of the process that the HRD ministry plans to use to punish top officials  owners and management officials  of offending institutions.         
	It prescribes a minimum financial punishment of Rs 5 lakh and a maximum of Rs 50 lakh. The draft bill also prescribes a jail sentence of up to three years.         
	The nature and extent of the punishment will depend on the degree of the offence  and will be decided by an education tribunal to fast-track these cases. The tribunal will have the powers of a trial court.         
	The bill draws a distinction between complaints of cheating where the complainant is likely to be the sole victim, and other cases where a large number of students may be victims.         
	It proposes civil proceedings against those found guilty in cases where the victim represents an isolated instance, and criminal charges where a large number of students are affected.         
	For instance, a student who complains that a bribe was sought by a particular official or that he was denied a promised educational tool  like a laptop  as punishment may be an individual victim.         
	But a mismatch between claimed infrastructure suggested by a prospectus or in advertisements and the real quality of laboratories or classrooms at the institution would constitute a violation against all students.         
	Officials at an institute charging capitation fees would be liable to face criminal charges, ministry sources said, as it would be assumed that they follow the practice widely with aspiring students.         
	In civil cases, offenders will have to pay only a fine while in criminal cases they could face a jail sentence of up to three years.         
	The University Grants Commission and the HRD ministry can de-recognise or stop grants to recognised institutions that fail to fulfil their obligations under the UGC act.         
	A fake university  an institution running without required recognition  can even now be fined under the UGC act, but the fine cannot be more than Rs 1,000 for each guilty administrator at the accused institution.         
	But the UGC act and the rules accompanying it do not empower the commission, ministry or any other government agency to act against recognised institutions that make false or misleading claims.         
	Individual students or rival educational institutions need to approach the Competition Commission of India at present for redress.

	Calcutta, June 26: Debi Prasad Mishra, the Orissa minister of higher education, tourism and culture, was in Calcutta with a mission, to promote the state as the next sunny destination for both national and international tourists.        
	Mishra attended the inauguration of Tourist Spot, a fair organised by the tourism ministry of the Bengal government in association with Ananda Bazar Patrika at Calcuttas Netaji Indoor Stadium.         
	At the fair venue, the minister held a brief meeting with Manabendra Mukherjee, the Bengal minister in-charge of tourism, and made a presentation.        
	We have decided to have a tie-up between the West Bengal Tourism Development Corporation and its Orissa counterpart so that we can encourage tourism between the two states. We are also going to extend road and railways connectivity between the two states. About 20 per cent of tourists coming to our state is after all from Bengal, said Mishra.         
	In fact even with the downturn, the number of tourists from Bengal to Orissa has seen an increase, he said.        
	We are also trying to get foreign tourists who visit Calcutta, to make a tour of Orissa, he added.        
	The minister promoted fresh destinations in Orissa. Puri can remain the nucleus, it is our pride. But, we are also developing other places to international standards. One such place is Shamuka, where a complete resort is being created in a public-private partnership.         
	One of the main challenges in the path of tourism growth is the lack of connectivity, admitted the minister, adding that his government was very focussed on developing tourism in the state as one of the avenues to achieve rapid economic growth.         
	We are also advertising through foreign channels such as the BBC, he said.         
	Mishra denied that the Naxalite menace may pose a threat to the states booming tourism business. Law and order is of prime importance to us (government) and we are working hard to maintain it. There has been no negative impact (of Maoist menace) on tourism. In fact, there has been a growth in tourism from last year. Indirectly and directly the earnings from tourism were worth Rs 3,000 crore, he said.         
	From the fair the minister went to the Floatel for a meeting with the tourism wing of the CII. We discussed investment opportunities in tourism in Orissa and ways to draw Buddhist tourists from south-east Asia and China. In August, representatives of the CII will be visiting our state and we will come to Calcutta in October for a buyer-seller meet, Mishra said, after the meeting.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | JD(U) slams RJD boss
                                                                                                               JD(U) slams RJD boss
                            
	Patna, April 19 (PTI): Criticising Lalu Prasads recent salvo against Congress that it had failed to prevent the demolition of the Babri mosque, the JD(U) today dared the RJD chief to come up with facts about the incident.        
	Reacting to Lalu Prasads comments, party spokesman Shivanand Tiwari told reporters here that Lalu Prasad was inconsistent in his statements for a long period of time and had the habit of implicating his opponents in many cases.        
	RJD boss Lalu Prasad should bare all the facts about the demolition before the nation and should not only threaten that he would spill the beans, he said.

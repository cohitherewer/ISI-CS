          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 13: Underprivileged students from government schools came together at an educational bal mela or childrens fair at Balakati, 10km from here, to entertain and be entertained.         
	The fair was organised by the American-Indo Foundation (AIF) responsible for implementing a computer-aided learning programme  Digital Equaliser  in 150 government schools.        
	The best part of the fair was that it offered some first-generation literate, a chance to showcase what they had learnt till date. At one end of the fair there were hundreds of first-time computer learners, all from rural pockets, who showcased their digital skills. The digital kiosk had posters on various branches of science.         
	While some went digital, others played doctor, as students measured the height and weight of visitors and went on to calculate their body-mass index and drew up a diet chart. The health kiosk where such activities were on displayed posters exploring the relation between food, nutrition and health with vignettes on nutritional value of Indian diets and caloric contents of Indian foods.         
	Its great. I have learnt how to use the camera to record, edit and make a movie. I also learnt how to use a computer, said Gayatri Khatua, the first girl in her family to got to school.         
	A number of students were also spotted sitting on the fair grounds folding papers and converting triangles into rectangles, measuring the area of circle and triangle not using either the compass, or scale or the protractor.         
	Explaining the idea behind the fair, Subrata Sarkar, the AIF team leader said: The fair provides an occasion for joyful, activity-based learning where computers and animation act as interactive tool. In contrast to the teacher-centric system where students are passive recipient, Digital Equaliser encourages students participation.         
	A teacher ought to use multiple modes of teaching such as activity, experiment, exploration and animation, said Mamata Patnaik, a science teacher.        
	Unfortunately, the present examination-oriented teaching only encourages rote memorisation, she added.        
	Just for fun, students gave computerised horoscopes to residents at a nominal cost.

	 Melbourne, Sept. 29 (PTI): Victoria Premier John Brumby is facing severe criticism for not raising the issue of an Indian fugitive during his ongoing trip to India.           
	Brumby today defended his decision by saying that talks about the fugitive could have made the extradition of the accused more difficult.

	 Ahmedabad (PTI): A student of the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, who had fever for the past two days, died on Tuesday. Tests done on Kamats swab have confirmed he did not die of swine flu, municipal officials said.

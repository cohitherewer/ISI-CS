The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Homemaker hangs herself after TV show
                                                                                                               Homemaker hangs herself after TV show
          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                          Actress Roopa Ganguly on Sach Ka Saamna with anchor Rajeev Khandelwal                                  
	Lucknow, Sept. 21: A homemaker in Agra sank into depression apparently after watching the final episode of Sach Ka Saamna and committed suicide, unable to come to terms with her divorce from her first husband and losing custody of their child.        
	Pallavi Arya, 32, hanged herself from a ceiling fan at her home in the Sikandra area of the city yesterday.         
	Her husband Dharmendra Arya, 38, who said they had been married about a month, claimed Pallavi was overwhelmed by emotion after watching actress Roopa Ganguly on the hot seat of the TV reality show.         
	Ashoke Kumar Singh, the inspector of Sikandra police, said a suicide note had been found in which Pallavi regretted not being a good mother and a good wife.         
	She has a 12-year-old son from her first husband whom she divorced last year. The son stays with his father in Indore.        
	The suicide note, written in Hindi, says: Everything is so beautiful in the world except me. I couldnt be a good daughter, mother, sister or wife and have become a problem for all... therefore (I am) going away, far away. I remember my son Kavi. Inform my husband and son of my death. Perhaps they may come for my last rites.        
	Inspector Singh said the suicide note didnt mention the show, but Dharmendra claimed his wife went into a shell after watching Sach Ka Saamna, which had Roopa as its guest in its final episode aired on Friday.        
	Her confidence level appeared to be eroding. She used to miss her son and former husband. If her second husbands statement is correct, she may have undergone a mental breakdown after watching Sach Ka Saamna, Singh said.        
	According to Dharmendra, his wife fell silent after one of the answers given by the actress who became a national star after playing Draupadi in the TV serial Mahabharat.        
	The question posed to Roopa was: If your relationship with your husband sours after any dispute, will you walk out on him?        
	The actress replied: No, not at all. In every relationship there are low moments. When this happens between a brother and his sister or mother and a son, do they quit?         
	Dharmendra told the police that the actresss bold take had an entirely different impact on his wife. She was suddenly seized with an overwhelming emotion that her life had reached a similar moment of truth, said Dharmendra, who owns a photo studio near the Taj Mahal.         
	For the next two days, Dharmendra said, Pallavi was in a state of acute depression and kept to herself at their home in Sikandras JR Silver Estate.        
	Dharmendra said that when he returned from work last evening, she did not open the door, which was locked from inside. The police had to be called in. When they broke open the door around 7pm, Pallavi was found hanging.        
	The show has had its impact on ordinary lives. On August 14, the security adviser of a shopping mall in Greater Noida committed suicide allegedly after finding out the disturbing truth about his wife, who had appeared on the show and revealed her past.        
	However, the producers of the show dismissed the incident as a case of mis-reporting by the media.        
	In another incident last month, a young husband attacked his wife in Meerut with a knife when he came to know about her relationship with another man prior to her marriage.         
	This is an unfortunate incident, if whatever has been reported is factual. But truth affects human lives in many ways. Suicide or an attack on ones wife is just one of them, the shows anchor Rajeev Khandelwal had said in a recent TV interview.

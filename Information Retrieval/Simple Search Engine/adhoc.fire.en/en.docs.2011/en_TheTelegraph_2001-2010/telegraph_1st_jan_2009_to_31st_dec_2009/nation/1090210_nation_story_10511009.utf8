          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Patna, Feb. 9: Eight persons were reportedly gunned down during a clash between two groups  one representing the bride and the other the groom  at Binoba Bhave village in Ganga Diara in north Bihars Naughachia, 350km from here, yesterday.         
	Police came to know of the incident today.        
	The village is located on the banks of the Ganga and is almost inaccessible due to the sand that surrounds it from all sides. The police that reached the village today have started to search for the bodies in the Ganga.         
	According to reports that reached the police, one Ratan Mandal, 25, and Kanchan, 20, got married secretly at a temple on Mandar hills a few days ago. Though the bride and groom belonged to the same caste, they belonged to warring families.         
	Later the brides father, Madhusudan Mandal, summoned the grooms family to the panchayat to settle the issue.         
	But the two groups turned violent exchanging several rounds of fire in which eight people were shot, said a policeman, who was present on the spot when the argument broke out.         
	An officer, however, said: Officially we can only confirm the incident when we find the bodies. We have been searching the bodies in the water but have failed so far.         
	So far, the police have also failed to find an eyewitness who is willing to go on record with the sequence of events.         
	Most villagers, especially the men, seem to have disappeared after the incident.        
	The village now wears a deserted look. The village is rather small and comprises 12 homes and equal number of families. Besides, there are no settlements near the Binoba Bhave which is adding to our problem, the officer said.         
	Sources at the police headquarters here confirmed that the murders were over the love affairs, but, we are still awaiting the details.

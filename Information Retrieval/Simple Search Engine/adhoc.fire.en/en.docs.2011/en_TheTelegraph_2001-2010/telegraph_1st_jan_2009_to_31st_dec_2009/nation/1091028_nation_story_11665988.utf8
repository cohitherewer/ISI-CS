  - Govt to increase youth employability          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                     
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 27: The state government today decided to design new training modules to increase employability of youths keeping in view of the global economic slowdown.        
	Presiding over a high-level meeting to review activities of the Employment Mission, chief minister Naveen Patnaik stressed on the need for imparting training in spoken English and soft-skill development to suit the needs of employers.         
	Officials told the chief minister that proposals had been given by Maruti Udyog Limited and Tata Group for opening a training centre for drivers and heavy machinery operators, respectively.        
	The Employment Mission has organised training on trades like cellphone repair, apparel making and masonry during the current fiscal.         
	A training programme on masonry was conducted in Bangalore in collaboration with Larsen amp; Toubro this year. Similarly, construction supervisor training was imparted to 1941 tribal youths for the first time in Orissa. The trainees were associated with the ongoing construction activities being undertaken by the Integrated Tribal Development Agencies and District Rural Development Agencies to gain first hand knowledge and they could eventually be groomed as construction contractors.        
	Short-term computer training was also imparted to at least 39,720 youths by the Orissa Computer Application Centre.         
	It was revealed from the review that vocational training was provided to 63,616 unemployed youths so far for skill upgrade.        
	Recruitment rallies were also held at Berhampur, Koraput, Sundargarh, Paradip and Bhubaneswar for induction into the defence and paramilitary forces, in which 18,565 youths participated. Pre-recruitment training has also been imparted to 700 candidates this year. So far, 7,212 youths from Orissa have been recruited by the Indian Army since 2005, official sources said.         
	Besides, credit support has been provided to 10.15 lakh youths through banks under various self-employment schemes since 2005.         
	The Employment Mission has also organised self-employment consultation rallies at various places in which 3.35 lakh youths have participated, added the sources.

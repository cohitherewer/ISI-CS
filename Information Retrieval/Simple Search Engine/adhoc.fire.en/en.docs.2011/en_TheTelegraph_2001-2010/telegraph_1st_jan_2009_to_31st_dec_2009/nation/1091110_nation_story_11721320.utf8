          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 9: Nokia today announced it would replace for free some of the chargers sold with its 7210 handset after detecting a manufacturing defect that could make the devices come apart.         
	In India, the replacement offer covers only chargers bought with the handsets after June 15. Only one model of the charger, AC-3E, manufactured by Chinas BYD between June 15 and August 9 is being exchanged globally. BYD makes chargers for Nokia.        
	V. Ramnath, director (operator channel, India), made it clear that the replacements were only a precautionary measure.         
	We are not aware of any incidents or injuries relating to these chargers, he said. Ramnath declined to specify how many chargers would have to be replaced but a company spokesperson claimed the numbers were expected to be negligible in India. Experts put the figure at 14 million worldwide.         
	A Nokia release described the problem, saying the plastic covers of the chargers could come loose and separate, potentially posing an electrical shock hazard.        
	Consumer help        
	Consumers can SMS CHG (space) and the 27-digit code printed on the charger and send it to 55555. Nokia will inform them whether that particular charger is a defective one via SMS.         
	Otherwise, customers can walk into a Nokia Care Centre or Nokia Priority shop or log onto http://chargerexchange.nokia.com to find out if the charger is faulty. Replacements will be given from the outlets or through courier.

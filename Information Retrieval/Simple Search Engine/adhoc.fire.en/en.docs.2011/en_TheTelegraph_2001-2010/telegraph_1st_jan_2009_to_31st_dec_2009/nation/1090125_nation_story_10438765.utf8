The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Humble PM strikes a chord in Pak
                                                                                                               Humble PM strikes a chord in Pak
          NASIR JAFFRY                           Singh with his childhood friend from Gah, Raja Ali Muhammad. File picture                                  
	Islamabad, Jan. 24: Home is praying, so is the hometown across the border.        
	Several Pakistani citizens today wished speedy recovery for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, widely admired here for his humbleness and statesmanship.         
	We pray for the early recovery of Dr Singh, who belongs to our area and it is this sense of belonging that make us proud of him, Nausheen Khan, a native of Chakwal district, the hometown of Singh, told The Telegraph.        
	Nausheen, a geo-chemist now based in Islamabad, said residents of her area take pride in telling people that Singh was born in Gah. Nobody would have ever thought that a kid who was born in a mud house and studied in a school which lacked basic facilities would one day become the head of a government.        
	Many in Pakistan believe that Singh can be instrumental in preserving the nascent peace process launched in 2004. India suspended the dialogue process after the November 26 terror attacks.        
	I am personally a fan of Dr Singh for his humbleness and the way he pushed forward the peace process with Pakistan, said Salahuddin Ahmad, owner of a furniture shop in Rawalpindi. He was praying for the Prime Ministers early recovery.        
	Mohammad Gulfam, a car spray painter, said: I am not a very educated person but my reading about this man is that he is brilliant, clear-headed, very educated and sensible. His colleague Pranab Mukherjee is often swayed by emotions.        
	A labourer, Mohammad Iqbal, said: I am a human being and the Indian Premier is also a human being. He also has a wife and family. Let us, therefore, join them in prayers for his early recovery.

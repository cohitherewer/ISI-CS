	New Delhi, Feb. 26: The cabinet has hiked central employees dearness allowance by 6 per cent, the raise announced on a day inflation was shown falling to a 15-month low of 3.36 per cent.        
	The move, which will cost the government Rs 6,020 crore till March 2010, prompted speculation the aim was to court the 80 lakh current and former employees ahead of the polls, whose dates could be declared anytime. Such increases cant be made once the Election Commission issues the poll notification.        
	The hike will be effective from January 1 (2009) and payable from March 1, home minister P. Chidambaram said after the cabinet meeting today.         
	The cabinet said it had hiked the DA from 16 per cent to 22 per cent because of the rise in the consumer price index for industrial workers, a barometer used to calculate allowances. This particular gauge, unlike the wholesale price index that measures general prices, has seen an upward trend.        
	Central pay was raised less than six months back.

                                                                                                               Pawar set to settle for less
                            
	New Delhi, May 20: Sharad Pawars NCP is likely to settle for two ministerial posts, one less than last time, in a reflection of its reduced Lok Sabha strength, senior leaders said.        
	We want two cabinet posts and one minister of state, but will settle for two in the cabinet, a senior party leader said.        
	In the last government, Pawar was agriculture minister and Praful Patel civil aviation minister.         
	Suryakanta Patil was minister of state in the rural development ministry  the slot the NCP seems ready to give up.        
	The party now has nine MPs, one less than last time. The losses mainly occurred in its bastion in western Maharashtra.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Trouble-hit: A Bihar farmer                                  
	Patna, Aug. 10: The Nitish Kumar government at its cabinet meeting here today declared 26 of its 38 districts as drought-hit and initiated measures to deal with the situation.        
	The state recorded a 43 per cent deficit in rainfall, which led to the decision. The districts declared as drought-hit include Siwan, Bhojpur, Gaya, Nalanda. Jehanabad, Rohtas and Kaimur.         
	Making the announcement, Nitish Kumar also announced that banks would keep recovery of farm loans suspended in mentioned districts. The government has called a meeting tomorrow to talk of this, he said.        
	The government has also raised the diesel subsidy being offered to farmers. Earlier, the farmers were receiving a subsidy on diesel for three irrigation that will be raised to four.         
	The chief minister said that the state government would appeal to the Centre to raise the working days being offered under the NREGA scheme in the drought-affected districts from the stipulated 100 days to more.         
	Nitish Kumar said that that the state government will submit a fresh memorandum to the Centre submitting a detailed assessment of the situation and seeking required assistance. Besides, an all-party delegation will meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh demanding relief.         
	He said that even the Opposition, including the RJD, at an all-party meeting convened yesterday, had supported the states demand to the Centre for aid to the tune of Rs 1,000 per katha in the drought-hit districts. According to RJDs estimate the Centre should release Rs 45,000 crore to the state to deal with the situation.         
	Nitish said that the government would involve all parties operating in the state, from villages to block levels, in the relief operations. The minister for water resources, Vijendra Yadav, has been assigned the task to co-ordinate the parties in the relief operations.         
	The state has already begun the exercise of chalking out a list of ministers-in-charge, who would be monitoring the relief operations. The ministers will have to attend two meetings per month to prepare reports on the districts assigned to them and submit them to the government.         
	The chief minister said that the government would keep assessing the situation in the hinterland and take action accordingly.         
	The states decision precedes Maharastra government and Uttar Pradesh governments declaring 129 tehsils and 27 districts, respectively, as drought-hit. The Jharkhand government has declared its total state as drought-hit.

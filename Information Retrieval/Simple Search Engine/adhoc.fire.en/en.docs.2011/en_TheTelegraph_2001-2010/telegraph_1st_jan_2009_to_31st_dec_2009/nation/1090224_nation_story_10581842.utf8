The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong fumes over pat for BJP
                                                                                                               Cong fumes over pat for BJP
          SHEENA K.                           Arjun Singh in Chhattisgarh. (PTI)                                  
	Raipur, Feb. 23: When a Union minister lands in Chhattisgarh, guess who gets most baffled? The states Congress leaders.         
	For many a times UPA Union ministers break into impromptu applause of the BJP-led government when they visit the state and that leaves local Congress leaders in a dilemma.         
	The latest incident involves Union minister for human resources Arjun Singh who put his own party men at the receiving end when he said: Chhattisgarh was now in the right hands (with the BJP in power).         
	Singh was here to attend a couple of official functions.         
	Singhs remark underlines that the state was not in the right hands earlier under the Ajit Jogi (Congress) rule before the BJP trounced it in 2003 Assembly polls and managed to retain power in 2008.         
	Singh is not the first Union minister to laud the BJP governance in the state.         
	Earlier, senior ministers including (former) Shivraj Patil, Manishankar Aiyer, Raghuvansh Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan have praised the Raman Singh government during their visits to the state  leaving their party cadre red faced.         
	Singh even moved a step further and denied the state Congresss allegation that the state BJP government was misusing Union funds.         
	However, at the end of the day, the Congress leaders succeeded in pursuing Singh that he was not on right political tracks.        
	Though Raman Singh government is doing well, the Congress will certainly gain more seats in the coming Lok Sabha elections in Chhattisgarh, he told reporters to give some solace to his party.         
	This is not a single instance there have been many more, fumed a state Congress functionary. If the praises continue, the Congress will have to close office in the state, he added.         
	The senior Congress leaders are planning to lodge an official complaint with the party high command.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pak talks nudge from US
                                                                                                               Pak talks nudge from US
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Burns                                  
	New Delhi, June 10: US under-secretary of state William Burns today met Shiv Shankar Menon amid reports that he was carrying a brief for resumption of dialogue between India and Pakistan.        
	Government sources said he had urged foreign secretary Menon to re-start the talks that were called off after the Mumbai attacks and assured him the US was pushing Pakistan to bring the 26/11 perpetrators to book.        
	It was imperative for India to solve its issues with Pakistan if peace and stability were to return to the region, sources quoted Burns as saying.        
	The Indian side is believed to have told Burns that Pakistan would have to take some action before dialogue could resume.        
	We never said no to dialogue with Pakistan. What we are saying is that for any dialogue to happen, Pakistan has to take meaningful action against terrorists based on its soil targeting India. It also has to bring the Mumbai attackers to justice, a source said.        
	The US talks nudge comes at a time a meeting between Manmohan Singh and Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari could happen on the sidelines of the Shanghai Co-operation Summit in Russia next week.        
	Burns, who began a three-day visit today, confined himself to saying Delhi was a major foreign policy priority for Washington.         
	Before Burns left for Delhi, US state department spokesperson Ian Kelly had said: Clearly, we would support more dialogue (between India and Pakistan). Im sure under-secretary Burns will talk about this issue.        
	Gilani olive branch        
	Pakistan Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani today said his country would offer the Indian leadership an olive branch to resume the bilateral composite dialogue as both countries could not afford war.        
	Pakistan and India faced common problems and it was in the interest of the whole region for the two nuclear powers to resume the dialogue which had stopped after last years Mumbai attacks, Gilani said.

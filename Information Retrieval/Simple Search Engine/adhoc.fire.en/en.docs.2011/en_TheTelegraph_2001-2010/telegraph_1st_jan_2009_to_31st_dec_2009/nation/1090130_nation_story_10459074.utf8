The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lashkar chopper strike alert 
                                                                                                               Lashkar chopper strike alert 
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 28: The Lashkar-e-Toiba planned a 9/11-type strike in Delhi with choppers around Republic Day, call intercepts of the outfits operatives have suggested.        
	The intercepts, collected by the Intelligence Bureau in Kashmir, mentioned the capital as the primary target of such an attack but the information was later included in the general security alerts sent to all states on January 23.        
	The Centre had asked states to step up vigil on their airports but requested them to keep the chopper raid warning under wraps to avoid panic in the run-up to R-Day.        
	Republic Day passed without any trouble but the alert hasnt been lowered, sources said, adding such warnings were usually for a few days before and after a specific date.        
	This evening, Maharashtra claimed it had received a hijack threat advisory for Mumbai airport. State home minister Jayant Patil said the advisory asked the authorities to keep a close watch on private aircraft and to sanitise parking bays for small aircraft and helicopters.        
	But Union home ministry officials denied having sent any fresh alerts. A ministry spokesperson clarified the advisory was issued before Republic Day. Later, after reports about the Mumbai hijack warning started doing the rounds, the ministry issued a statement to clear the air.         
	State governments had been requested to maintain highest vigilance to prevent all such activities (attacks).        
	After the intercepts indicated private helicopters could be hijacked or stolen by terrorists, the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security asked airlines, especially operators offering choppers, to be more vigilant.        
	Anti-aircraft guns are still on stand-by, ministry sources said, adding the 60 unmanned airstrips or airfields across the country are also under a security blanket.         
	Closer to Delhi, a warning has gone out for tight vigil on Noida in Uttar Pradesh and Gurgaon in Haryana, from where aerial attacks could be launched on Delhi.

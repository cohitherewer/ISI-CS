                                                                                                               Medico texts kidnap, found within hours 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 4: Tanvi Chaubey, a second-year student at Calcutta Medical College, sent an SMS to her father and a classmate around 7 this evening to say she had been abducted. By midnight, she had been found.        
	We tracked the girl using the mobile tower and she was spotted in the Fariapukur area roaming around aimlessly, with her cellphone in her hand, said Nurul Anwar, Jorasanko OC.         
	In between, Tanvi sent a steady stream of text messages to friends and the media.        
	The first SMS, in Hindi, said she was kidnapped from outside a State Bank of India ATM near the College Street campus of Calcutta University.        
	Sujata Sarengi, the classmate who received it, approached the police outpost on the college campus, and Jorasanko police station was informed.         
	Tanvis father, Alok Hari Chaubey, who also received the message, went to the police later.        
	By then, she had sent another message  at 8.30pm. This one said two burqa-clad women had forced her into a taxi and were sitting on either side. They had blindfolded her, the SMS said.        
	Shes a good student, and there is no reason why she would do something like this by herself, Tanvis father said. Her third semester exams begin tomorrow.        
	We dont know about any boyfriends or of anyone who would want to harm her, the father added.         
	The police questioned other residents of the hostel, from where Tanvi had stepped out to withdraw money. Several search teams fanned out with her picture in hand.         
	DC Central Asit Pal said: We are treating it primarily as an abduction case.        
	The Telegraph contacted Tanvi by SMS, and she said she had been locked in a room and that two ladies are there. They have covered and tied me, she said. The 21-year-old said she didnt know where she was.        
	A while later, the police found her at Fariapukur in Shyambazar, a few kilometres from her Shyamnagar home where her parents and brother live. Till late into the night, Tanvi was being questioned at Lalbazar.

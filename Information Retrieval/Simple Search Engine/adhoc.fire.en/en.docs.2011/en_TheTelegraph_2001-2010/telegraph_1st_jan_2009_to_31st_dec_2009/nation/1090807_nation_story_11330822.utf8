                                                                                                               Bill bungle in House, twice in a week 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 6: The government tripped in Parliament the second time in a week when it was forced to put off a bill today because it hadnt engaged the Congress sufficiently and taken the Opposition lightly.        
	The Rubber (Amendment) Bill, 2009, was deferred in the Lok Sabha because of the absence of the ministers concerned and the apparent lack of consensus in the Congress. Commerce minister Anand Sharma and his deputy, Jyotiraditya Scindia, were out of the country. Either of the two should have been around. The BJP refused to allow the assigned minister, Prithviraj Chavan, to introduce it on the ground of propriety.        
	The bill pertains to the rubber plantations in Kerala. Three MPs of the states Congress-led United Democratic Front had objections and claimed Pranab Mukherjee, the leader of the Congress in the House, had assured them the bill wouldnt be introduced.         
	On Monday, the government was caught off guard when the Opposition foiled the introduction of the Judges (Declaration of Assets and Liabilities) Bill, 2009, in the Rajya Sabha, objecting to the exemptions proposed for the higher judiciary.        
	Congress sources said the government should have assessed the mood of the House better.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BSF camp cant have BDR chief memorial
                                                                                                               BSF camp cant have BDR chief memorial
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, April 3: The foreign ministry has shot down a proposal to let the BSF have a memorial to slain Bangladesh Rifles chief Shakil Ahmed as a symbol of the two border forces friendship, sources said.        
	The BSF credits Ahmed, killed during the BDR mutiny in February, with transforming relations between the two countries border forces, which had sunk to a low after 19 BSF men were killed by the BDR in 2001.        
	There was a proposal to name a building or some structure at the BSF camp in Chhawla (near Gurgaon) after Ahmed, a home ministry source said.        
	However, the foreign ministry apparently thought that India, despite its goodwill for Sheikh Hasina Wajeds fledgling and embattled government, should not be seen as going overboard.        
	Visibly disappointed BSF officers revealed the rejection of the proposal after the current BDR chief, Major General Mainul Islam, left India on Wednesday after a three-day trip. During the visit, the BSFs most emotional tribute to Ahmed, therefore, remained the heap of rose petals before a framed photograph.        
	A senior BSF officer spoke of how, at meetings during Ahmeds tenure, senior officers of both the forces laughed at their respective countries foreign office mandarins as comma, fullstop men.        
	Ahmeds successor, a 1977-batch officer, had once undergone training at the military facility in Mhow in India.        
	The home ministry walked the extra mile to greet Islam with warmth. Despite his delayed arrival from Dhaka, Islam and his team were granted a meeting with home minister P. Chidambaram and home secretary Madhukar Gupta.

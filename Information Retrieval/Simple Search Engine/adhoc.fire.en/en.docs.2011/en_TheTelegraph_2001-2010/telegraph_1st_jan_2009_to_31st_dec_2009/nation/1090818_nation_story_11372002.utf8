The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | RSS skips Jinnah hot potato
                                                                                                               RSS skips Jinnah hot potato
          SANJAY K. JHA                          Jaswant                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 17: The unwritten motto at BJP leader Jaswant Singhs book release today was: Demonise Nehru, praise Jinnah.        
	Although it evoked some resistance from journalists B.G. Verghese and M.J. Akbar, Jaswants overriding intent of dispelling the impression that Jinnah was a villain who caused Indias partition received extraordinary support from the panel of speakers.        
	The BJP, however, has reserved its response to the book, titled Jinnah: India, Partition, Independence, mindful that a little praise for Jinnah had cost L.K. Advani the party presidents post four years ago.        
	Whatever little has come out of the books contents has already created a ferment within the RSS and the BJP, with many leaders reacting with anger in private conversations.        
	No BJP or Sangh leader attended todays event, though both Mohan Bhagwat and Rajnath Singh had been at the release of Advanis autobiography, My Country My Life.        
	The Sangh and the BJP are preparing to distance themselves from Jaswants views that Jinnah was a secularist and was not responsible for the Partition.        
	However, many of the speakers congratulated Jaswant on his courage in writing the book despite the Sangh parivars strong views about Jinnah.        
	Lawyer Ram Jethmalani described Jinnah as a true secularist and blamed the Partition on Nehru. He said Jinnah had been a great collaborator of Gandhi in achieving freedom for India and regretted he had been demonised by a people that idolised Nehru.        
	British MP and economist Meghnad Desai said Jinnah had been turned into a villain through a complete fabrication of facts, and claimed the Partition happened because of Nehrus individualism and crude Marxism.        
	He said the Congress had no right to represent Muslims and accused Nehru of mindlessly rejecting Jinnahs genuine demand for a guarantee about Muslim rights.         
	Hindi commentator Namwar Singh too praised Jaswant for using documentary evidence to show that Jinnah did not envisage an Islamic state.        
	The CEO of Pakistani media group Dawn, Hamid Haroon, wondered why India did not explore the true Jinnah. Pakistan, he said, avoided doing it because Jinnah was too liberal and progressive for the bigoted rulers who succeeded him.         
	Verghese, questioned the premise that Jinnah was secular. He likened Jinnahs threat of direct action with the tactics of the Taliban and accused the then Muslim League of communal blackmail. He defended Nehru and the Congress for rejecting Jinnahs two-nation theory.        
	Akbar too attacked the claims that Nehru was responsible for the Partition and that Jinnah was secular but praised Jaswant for lifting history from the trap of passion.

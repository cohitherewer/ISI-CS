  - Creative workshop in Kashmir protest hub           MUZAFFAR RAINA                           Students take part in the workshop in Srinagar                                         
	Srinagar, Aug. 3: Youths from the land of street protests are waking to the charm of the theatre and the pen.         
	A group of students honed their talents at a weeklong creative workshop at Baba Demb in downtown Srinagar, a locality whose youths are better known for their propensity for stone-throwing.         
	Organised by the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (Intach) and the Sir Dhoranji Tata Trust of Mumbai, the workshop trained students in five subjects  theatre, painting, photography, filmmaking and creative writing.        
	This is perhaps the first workshop of this magnitude in Kashmir, more so in the old city, theatre personality M.K. Raina, one of the organisers, said.         
	The purpose is to provide an opening to the students. They are like frightened pigeons and we encourage them to look at themselves and unleash their creativity.         
	Hundreds of students from Classes IX to XI, from five districts in Kashmir, volunteered to be part of this workshop, but only 50-odd were chosen.         
	The choice of the venue  the old part of the city  was not a natural one. This is certainly not an ideal space, but tell me where do you have the cultural infrastructure for such an exercise in Kashmir? asked Raina, a Kashmiri Pandit.         
	Saleem Baig, the convener of the Kashmir chapter of Intach, said the venues proximity to the cultural centre of Kashmir was one reason.         
	We took the students on a heritage walk which starts from Fateh Kadal, then goes through Khanqwah Moula, Pather Masjid, Mazar-e-Salateen and Zain Abideen Badshahs tomb  signposts of our cultural excellence  to acquaint them with that brilliance, Baig said.         
	Cultural activities have been depressed in the Valley since armed insurgency began in 1989. Even films were banned because they encouraged immorality or imposed Indian culture. Cultural activities have picked up, but the ban on cinemas remains.         
	A student who admitted having participated in stone-throwing said this was a very different experience. I learnt there are some other things to do in life, he said.         
	After a pause, he added: Theatre can also be a form of protest.         
	Saima Manzoor, a student from Srinagar, was learning about the theatre. When I told my parents that I wanted to join this workshop, their first response was that they wanted to talk to my teachers. I got the go-ahead only after my teachers convinced them, Saima, who is among 17 girls in the group, said.         
	The students had no knowledge of the fields they were chosen to be a part of. Around 95 per cent participants were unable to express themselves, but they have gained so much confidence after only a week, Anees Aazmi, an expert in creative writing, said.         
	I invited a father to listen to a poem written by his daughter who was otherwise scared to do it for fear she would be laughed at. She stunned everybody with her poem.         
	Aazmi was one of several experts who came from various parts of the country to train the students.         
	We do not provide them with a subject, they evolve it themselves. Their thinking is no different from that of children from other places, Kriti V. Sharma, a theatre expert, said.         
	We ask them what kind of world they would create if they had their way. Respect for each other, technological advancement but with a safe environment and a place where there is no deforestation are some of the issues they have come up with.         
	The workshop was being held even as Kashmir witnessed protests, and organising the event was not without risk.         
	Some 15 participants were caught in crossfire on Saturday at Regal Chowk during a field exercise. The students were inside a bookshop as militants opened fire and injured two CRPF men. The shopkeeper downed his shutters as the students took shelter inside.

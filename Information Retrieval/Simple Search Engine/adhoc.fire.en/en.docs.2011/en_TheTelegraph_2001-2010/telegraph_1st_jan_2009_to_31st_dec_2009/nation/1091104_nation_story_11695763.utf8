          OUR BUREAU                           Chidambaram greets the Darul Uloom rector in Deoband on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 3: P. Chidambaram today became the first Union home minister to visit the Darul Uloom but returned not only without political dividends but also to be greeted by a combative BJP.        
	The Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind, whose 30th conference he attended at the Deoband seminary in Uttar Pradeshs Saharanpur, expressed disappointment at his lacklustre address.        
	But the BJP got much-needed ammo against the Congress because of a Jamiat resolution, passed in the ministers presence, asking Muslims not to sing the national song, Vande Mataram.        
	Chidambaram had expected to build on the anti-terrorism fatwa Darul had issued last year. Prepared well, he praised not only the Jamiat but also the founding fathers of the seminary. Our Muslim brethren are honoured citizens of India. It is a matter of pride for us that all major religions including Islam exist and thrive in India.        
	But the paeans went unheard by the thousands of moulvis who had expected something more promising.         
	We are disappointed. The home minister represented the Congress and even named Sonia Gandhi. He should have said something more concrete. We were expecting a statement on reservation for Muslims and the promises made in the manifesto, said Jamiat secretary N.A. Farooqui.        
	But the Vande Mataram resolution appeared to be the bigger problem. Patriotism does not require singing the Vande Mataram. We love our country and have proved this several times, but Vande Mataram violates our faith in monotheism, it states.        
	The move reaffirms a 2006 Darul fatwa that described the recitation of Vande Mataram as anti-Islamic. Todays resolution also condemned the exploitation of the song to target Muslims.        
	The BJP was quick to smell an opportunity. Party vice-president Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said the presence of Chidambaram at the programme gave legitimacy to the resolution and reflected the UPAs weak policy on terror and separatism.        
	The BJP also slammed him for his remark that the demolition of the Babri Masjid was a manifestation of religious fanaticism and an act of extreme prejudice.        
	But the home minister may have unwittingly given himself an excuse. At the beginning of his speech, he had said: It is a new experience for me to address a group of religious scholars and leaders.        
	Government sources said the BJP was unnecessarily raking up a two-year-old resolution on the national song and was spoiling its chances of reconciling with Muslims.        
	Another Jamiat resolution opposed the plan for a Central Madrasa Board, sniffing an attempt to interfere in the madrasa education system. The Jamiat warned against legalising homosexuality and enacting a 33 per cent reservation for women in legislatures, calling these unacceptable.

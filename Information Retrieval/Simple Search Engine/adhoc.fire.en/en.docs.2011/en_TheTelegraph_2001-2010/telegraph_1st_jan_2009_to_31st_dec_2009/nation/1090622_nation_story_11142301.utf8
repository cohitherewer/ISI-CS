                                                                                                               Rebel protests cripple Koraput
          OUR CORRESPONDENT      
	Bhubaneswar, June 21: Prices of essential commodities in Koraput have skyrocketed while several roads remained blocked by felled trees for the past week.        
	With petrol outlets about to run out of supplies, people have been forced to walk long distances. Vehicles have remained off the roads for the past five days. Naxalites had blocked roads at several areas across the district by felling trees. Now, the rebels have called a bandh to protest against the visit of home minister P. Chidambaram, who will be in Koraput and Kandhamal on June 22. The three-day bandh also coincides with the Martyrs Week observed by the rebels.         
	The call has put the administration on its toes and it is now working round-the-clock with bomb disposal squads and special police to avoid any untoward incidents.         
	Though traffic did resume at some places today after the administration moved the felled trees, clearance work, the public complained was on at the snails pace. Security persons were reportedly being extra cautious and checking for landmines while cleaning the trees.        
	Meanwhile, a rival group of Chasi Mulia Adivasi Sangha (CMAS) took out a rally in Bandhugaon condemning the state of affairs and submitted a memorandum to Koraput collector B.C. Das. On Monday, CMAS activists had taken possession of lands that they claimed belonged to tribals and were later usurped by non-tribals. Taking advantage of the tension, Naxalites on Friday triggered landmine blasts at Narayanpatna block, killing nine personnel.

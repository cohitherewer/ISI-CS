          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, Dec. 31: Alleged land grabbing during construction of Windsor Place, a community centre sprawling over 50,000sqft of land at the Satellite Township, developed by Cuttack Development Authority (CDA), has embroiled state higher education minister Samir Dey in an unsavoury controversy.         
	Windsor Place was being constructed by Cuttack Gymkhana Club Private Limited, a private company owned by the ministers brother-in-law, Debidutta Duttaray.         
	CDA had allotted the company 35,000 sq-ft for the community centre under a build and operate agreement drawn up on May 7, 2003. But, the construction had allegedly taken over 15,700 sq-ft adjacent to it.        
	The alleged grabbing of prime government land at Sector 6 of the satellite towship  Abhinava Bidanasi Kataka  was detected recently and the CDA authorities initiated action to retrieve the encroached land. CDA had first started off by terminating the agreement drawn up with Cuttack Gymkhana Club Private Limited for operating the community centre and seized the security deposit amounting to Rs 2.70 lakh.         
	On Monday, CDAs enforcement squad had initiated measures to acquire the encroached land and bulldozed the boundary wall. But, the move hit a road block after a status quo order was issued on the disputed land by the vacation court of high court yesterday. The two judge vacation bench of Justice I.M. Qudussi and Justice B.P. Ray issued the status quo order on a petition filed by Cuttack Gymkhana Club Private Limiteds managing director Debidutta Duttaray.                     
	Duttaray has challenged the cancellation of the agreement. The petition has alleged that the CDA had provided 31,267 sq-ft when it was expected to provide 35,000 sq-ft under the build and operate agreement.         
	The court has fixed January 5 for the case hearing and the status quo order shall remain effective till then.

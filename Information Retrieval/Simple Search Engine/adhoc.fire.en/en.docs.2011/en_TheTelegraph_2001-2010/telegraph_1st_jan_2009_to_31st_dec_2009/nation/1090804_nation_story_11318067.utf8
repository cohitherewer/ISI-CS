The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | At the ready, eyeball to eyeball: the price of brushing aside 1998 firing
                                                                                                               At the ready, eyeball to eyeball: the price of brushing aside 1998 firing
										      SANKARSHAN THAKUR       BACK TO FRONT - 10 YEARS OF CARGIL 2                            Soldiers after the conquest of Tiger Hill; (below)the Humbotingla Pass that links Kargil to forward posts in the Batalik sector                                 
	First light has just about broken and the mountains are ringing with what is now their routine wake-up call: the report of shells being fired and shells landing. In an open field, a little below this barren plateau, two Bofors guns are noisily coughing lead and the counterblast from across is peppering the surrounding hills, columns of smoke and dust rising in the wispy morning. This is almost too beautiful to be a war.         
	From a report in The Telegraph, May to June 1999              
	Among the many ugly things about war is the subterfuge that goes into its telling; often, even when youre writing the truth, you arent writing the whole truth.         
	The reality of peril lurking over Kargil had begun to knock much before it flared into a frontier conflict in the summer of 1999. The sustained shelling of the September of 1998 should have attracted notice; but nobody heard, or if they did, they decided to brush under the facts about it. What was a gorgeous outpost for niche forbidden land travellers  Zanskar and Ladakh  became a forbidding battlefront. It could be brushed under no more.         
	There existed a fair wartime bar  and still does, because war is always just someones mad moment away  on revealing battlefield locations. Garrisons, gun-points, bunkered observation posts, where or how the war machine was being moved. There were some targets the intruder-adversary had a clear sense, and often a clear vision, of  most of National Highway 1A, linking Srinagar to Kargil and Leh, the fledgling brigade at Drass and the more elaborate army encampments immediately above Kargil town.         
	But there were others on which stealth was a premium  mobile Bofors units; newly jigged embattlements in Mushkoh and Pandrass, both protected from artillery fire by looming hills; the massing of men and machines up Humbotingla, a grinding, but critical, pass that connected Kargil to the remote and treacherous battle zones in the Batalik ridges. A good story from the frontlines often came attached with a price tag  no names, no locations  or changed locations.         
	Call it clever propaganda, call it sloppy coordination, but very often the Delhi war briefings by Colonel Bikram Singh (now a lieutenant general heading the Srinagar-based 15 Corps) and subsequent reports had little connect with what we saw unfolding on the front first hand  there was constant hedging, fudging, hiding, all established tools of war.         
	The euphemism they used on the front was reasonable restrictions and it meant that much before the era of embedded war reporting was inaugurated by the Americans in Iraq, Kargil offered occasion to feel like a strategic ancillary to the war effort. Make sure your presence here is off the record, an embattled colonel in Batalik had told me early in the course of the 1999 war, how did you even manage your way here, this camps meant to be a secret.         
	Getting there had been as simple as hiring a ready driver in Kargil and heading up; everyone was too busy fighting off the intrusion, there were no roadblocks. But the colonel of Batalik wasnt convinced and on a later visit he would fume at the use of his base camp as dateline: You probably dont realise, but you are giving things away. A hyperbolic complaint if there was any; the adversary had the colonels position in his crosshairs way before it became a newspaper dateline, it had been under fire a fortnight.         
	Anyhow, its a fair bet the colonel would have reason to be annoyed at being located today. Covert wartime exigencies have become overt peacetime imperatives. There is too little now that escapes satellite eyes. Besides, there is just too much to hide. Where do you hide a whole new and expanded brigade headquarters? Where do you hide a school of mountain warfare training sprawled across two hillsides and more? Where do you hide coordinates of positions you daily fired from in 1999? Where do you hide a howitzer gun as big as the Bofors if its on a permanent station? Where do you hide such elaborate arrangements?         
	Its pointless hiding in this day and age, and you cant, even if you wished to, said a young lieutenant, recently arrived at the mountain warfare centre in Drass, and probably thats also the point. You want to tell them you are well prepared now. In 1999, the first wave of troops could not even breathe at these heights, they did not know how to climb, they had no sense of rock and earth and gradient, which is why we suffered initially. Today, we are much better prepared, lessons have been learnt.         
	The intrusion of 1999 ensured the 300-odd-kilometre stretch south of the LoC  an uneven loaf of land running from Zojila to Leh through Matayen, Pandrass, Mushkoh, Drass, Kharbu, Kargil and Batalik  was drastically upgraded from a summertime deployment zone into a busy all-weather garrison.         
	This is like Siachen now, said a top army officer stationed in Khumbathang near Kargil. Only it is much, much bigger. The template is the same, we know where they are, they know where we are, its pure and open deterrence, eyeball to eyeball and all across the barren mountains. Expensive and very taxing, but theres no way out. The lies and bungling that preceded 1999 left none.

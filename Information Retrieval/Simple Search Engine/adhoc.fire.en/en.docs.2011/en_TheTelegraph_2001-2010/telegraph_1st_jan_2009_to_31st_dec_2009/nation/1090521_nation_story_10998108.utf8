The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Minority swing costs CPM 
                                                                                                               Minority swing costs CPM 
          BISWAJIT ROY                                            
	Calcutta, May 20: The CPM officially denies the existence of a minority vote bank, but party leaders concede that erosion of Muslim votes was the main reason behind the Lefts poll debacle in Bengal.        
	Of the five minority candidates the party fielded, only one, newcomer Sahidul Haque, won (in Burdwan-Durgapur) while veterans like Hannan Mollah (Uluberia) and Mohammad Salim (Calcutta North) were humbled.        
	Party leaders acknowledge that Muslims, who account for more than 25 per cent of Bengals population, voted against the ruling Left from Malda to East Midnapore, propelling the Trinamul-Congress-SUCI combine to victory in at least 20 of the 26 seats it won.        
	Muslim vote is a decisive factor in at least 22 of the states 42 seats, and the CPM and its allies were wiped out from 10 districts in south Bengal and three in the north.        
	It is a huge swing in Muslim votes against us across the state  from Raiganj (in North Dinajpur) to Kakdwip (in South 24-Parganas), land minister and CPM state committee member Abdur Rezzak Mollah said.        
	We suffered a huge erosion in our base among Muslims and it made a lot of difference, echoed party comrade Rupchand Pal, a six-time MP from Hooghly who was defeated.        
	The minority factor, coupled with a substantial loss of support among Scheduled Castes who make up 23 per cent of the states population, played havoc in rural South 24-Parganas and North 24-Parganas where the Left lost all six seats  Basirhat, Barasat, Bongaon, Diamond Harbour, Mathurapur and Joynagar.         
	It also wrecked the Marxists in Jadavpur, Barrackpore and Dum Dum  urban/industrial seats in the two 24-Parganas.         
	Defeated six-time MP from Barrackpore Tarit Topdar trailed by 28,000, 20,000 and 4,500 votes in Amdanga, Bhatpara and Kamarhati Assembly segments, respectively, all minority-dominated areas.        
	Amitava Nandi, the party MP humbled in Dum Dum, trailed his Trinamul rival Saugata Roy by around 7,500 votes in segments like Muslim-dominated Rajarhat.        
	In Calcutta North and South, CPM candidates Mohammad Salim and Rabin Deb trailed Sudip Bandopadhyay and Mamata Banerjee in all the Assembly segments, including in Muslim-dominated areas of the city.        
	Both Bengali-speaking Muslims in rural areas and their Urdu-speaking urban counterparts voted against us en masse, said a CPM minority leader.        
	Many defeated CPM MPs said the decision to snap ties with the Congress and call for a third alternative were to blame for the anti-Left wave within the community.        
	The Opposition swept the minority votes as Muslims felt that the Left-led third front would facilitate the return of the BJP at the Centre, said Rabin Deb, who lost in Calcutta South.        
	In Delhi, the CPM politburo also admitted in a statement yesterday that the minorities voted for the Opposition to ensure that the BJP did not make a comeback.        
	Salim said the Lefts anti-US campaign had failed to stem Muslim discontent over Singur and Nandigram, implementation of the Sachar Committees recommendations and the CPMs handling of the Rizwanur Rahman episode. Threat of US imperialism is not part of the communitys everyday experience in Bengal. They vented their ire against us after finding a viable alternative in the Trinamul-Congress alliance.        
	Minister Mollah said farmer discontent and fear of land acquisition fuelled existing grievances over lack of equal opportunity in employment. We failed to understand that most Muslims in rural Bengal depend on farming.        
	He and other CPM minority leaders cited the 2001 census report to point out that 20.3 per cent of Bengals farmers were Muslims while 26.5 per cent of farm labourers in the state were from the community.        
	The community had never voted en bloc earlier, said Mohammad Salim. This time, Muslims showed they could be major agents of change. Its ramification would be long-term in Bengal politics.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Post-split, success stories continue
                                                                                                               Post-split, success stories continue
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, May 25: The Super-30 was a huge hit in 2008 with all its 30 candidates cracking the Indian Institute of Technology-Joint Entrance Examinations (IIT-JEE).         
	Some of the feeling of euphoria over the results soured as the brains behind the novel concept, mathematician Anand Kumar and IPS officer Abhayanand, split taking separate paths to prepare their next batches of under-privileged students. The split, however, has spelt good fortune for a greater number of students in 2009, as 28 of the 30 students tutored by Anands Super-30 and 48 of 55 selected by Abhayanand have made it to the IIT this year.        
	The mathematician and a former director-general of police, got together seven years ago to evolve the Super-30 concept. The duo would pick 30 talents from Bihars socially and economically deprived classes to prepare them, free of cost, for the IIT-JEE. The concept attained its glorious best last year with all its 30 aspirants making it to the IITs.         
	The duo split soon after with Abhayanand  a master in physics  deciding to broaden the reach of the Super-30 including several districts. He ended up picking aspirants and coaching them with the help of charitable bodies.         
	Abhayanand picked up 10 aspirants from the Muslim community and 54 from the Backward and Scheduled Castes. Abhanand told The Telegraph: All the 10 Muslim students made it through, while 38 of the 44 from the Dalit and Backward sections drawn from Patna, Nalanda and Bhagalpur have cracked the IIT-JEE.         
	The IPS officer said that soon his experiment would expand to other backward districts. Anand, too, was happy with his success rate, however, described his split with Abhayanand as a loss to the Super-30 concept.         
	Anand also runs a professional coaching institute that saw 60 of its 100 aspirants crack the IIT-JEE. Another coaching institution that has fared better in Patna is Parmar Classes that saw 60 of its 200 candidates clear the exams.         
	We do not pick and chose candidates on the basis of their caste and creed. Merit and payment of required fee are the only criteria, said Anil Parmar, the director of the Parmar Classes.         
	While Rahmania, a charitable Muslim body, extended financial support to the 10 Muslim aspirants, Tribeni a charitable body run by Bengals Shubkumar Tribeni  supported 44 students picked up by Abhayanand.         
	All the Muslim students belonged to extremely poor families, said Shabbirul Huda, the spokesperson for Rahmani.

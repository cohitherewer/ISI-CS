	Shimla, April 24: A two-month-old strike by subordinate staff at one of Asias oldest boarding schools turned violent today, leaving three persons seriously injured        
	The incident at Shimlas Bishop Cotton School, founded in 1859, took place after agitating employees allegedly caught hold of Prem Singh Thakur, the accounts in-charge, when he tried to enter the school office and blackened his face.        
	We have arrested two persons, Prem Lal and Rajpal, for physically assaulting and dishonouring Prem Singh Thakur.... The accused employees prevented him from entering the office, R.M. Sharma, the Shimla SP, said.        
	A scuffle apparently broke out when Thakurs relatives turned up a while later, the police said. It then went out of hand. Citu leaders also joined the striking employees. The incident happened in front of a police post but the lawkeepers stayed away.         
	The standoff began on February 27 when talks between retrenched staff and the school management failed. Some 33 employees, sacked on December 6, 2008, on charges of pilferage and dishonesty, then went on an indefinite strike. Later 76 more joined in.         
	The charges of dishonesty and pilferage are baseless and concocted. All employees are honest. We will continue to raise our voice till they are re-instated, Chunni Lal, the president of the school workers union, said.         
	The strike has hit maintenance and cleaning services and the laundry at the school that has about 525 students.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Birth of Karat baby, with Maya push
                                                                                                               Birth of Karat baby, with Maya push
          OUR BUREAU                          Naidu with Gowda at the rally on Thursday. (PTI)                                  
	March 12: Prakash Karats baby was finally born today, midwifed by a former Prime Minister, with an electrifying push from a woman who could be a key player.        
	The Third Front came alive at a packed rally at Dobbspet, 50km from Bangalore, where the Left and four regional parties joined hands for a national alternative to the combines led by the Congress and the BJP.        
	CPM general secretary Karat declared the gathering a historic get-together of all secular and democratic parties.        
	The Congress dubbed it the biggest falsehood of Indian politics and vowed to defeat it in the name of secularism.        
	Apart from the Left parties, the Fronts constituents are former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowdas Janata Dal (Secular), former Andhra Pradesh chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidus Telugu Desam, Telengana Rashtra Samiti and Bhajan Lals Haryana Janahit Party.        
	BSP boss Mayavati and ADMK chief Jayalalithaa didnt attend the rally but sent emissaries  a sign that they were keeping options open.        
	She (Mayavati) sent her senior-most leader in a special aircraft, said a beaming Gowda, the architect of todays meet and whose supporters, brought in buses, filled the venue. In many minds, it has had an electrifying effect.        
	Jayalalithaa was initially against sending a representative as she was apprehensive that Left leaders and Gowda might use the platform to project Mayavati as the Fronts candidate for Prime Minister. The former Tamil Nadu chief minister relented only after Gowda reportedly called to assure her that there was no such proposal.        
	CPI chief A.B. Bardhan said he was very confident that Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik, whose BJD parted ways with the BJP recently, would also join the Front.        
	The Front, which mirrors the United Front experiment of 1996 when Gowda headed a coalition at the Centre, is expected to release its common programme soon.        
	Karat, whose brainchild many had written off as stillborn, said they came together because the country needed an alternative.        
	Our critics tell us you are a combination of regional parties which are coming together on an opportunistic platform, he said. I would like to tell them, in our vast country with such diversity, our parties represent the reality of that diversity.        
	In Delhi, Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari said Indias political history stands testimony to the fact that whenever the parties who call themselves the third front ruled at the Centre, the biggest beneficiaries were the communal forces.

          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, Nov. 27: Chief minister K. Rosaiah nearly slipped and fell at the state Congress headquarters this evening but politically, the 77-year-old stood on firmer ground than ever before.        
	The Congress high command today put a lid on the crisis in Andhra Pradesh by getting the caretaker chief minister virtually endorsed by the legislature party at its first meeting since Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddys death nearly three months ago.        
	The resolution adopted at the afternoon meeting did not name Rosaiah, leaving it to Sonia Gandhi to decide who should be in the hot seat. But its import was clear: Rosaiah keeps his chair.        
	It was a far cry from the resolution adopted by the state cabinet the day Rosaiah was sworn in chief minister  it had asked Sonia to appoint YSRs son Jaganmohan to the top job.        
	Jagan himself moved todays resolution after being nudged by the Congress leaderships emissaries, Union ministers Pranab Mukherjee and Veerappa Moily.        
	Hours later, the six-foot-tall Rosaiah missed a step while climbing down from the dais at Gandhi Bhavan but escaped injuries as he was grabbed immediately by security escorts.        
	From the dais, addressing party workers, Rosaiah had earlier spoken of keeping the party united, completing YSRs programmes and deriving inspiration from Rahul Gandhi. He said he would walk in the footsteps of Rahul and YSR (mentioning them in that order).        
	Todays legislature party meeting was attended by 150 of the partys 155 MLAs, 59 of its 74 MLCs and 29 of its 42 MPs from the state.        
	Mukherjee later told party officials he understood Congress workers (pro-Jagan) sentiments but urged them to understand the partys limitations in the changed circumstances.        
	He stressed the need for unity and said the Congress would have won the recent Hyderabad civic polls by a better margin had the workers stood together.        
	The high command has long been unhappy with the pro-Jagan revolt. It has denied Jagans plea to field him from the Pulivendula seat, vacated by YSRs death, for which polls are scheduled on December 19.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pranab aims varsity sting at Sibal 
                                                                                                               Pranab aims varsity sting at Sibal 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Pranab Mukherjee                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 23: Repeated changes in the HRD ministrys higher education expansion plans may have irked finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, who targeted Kapil Sibal with a rare barb last Monday.        
	Mukherjee suggested the HRD minister might be struggling to start promised new central universities, providing the first hint of discontent at Sibals functioning from a senior Congress minister, The Telegraph has learnt.         
	The finance ministers remark to Sibal came in the presence of the Prime Minister at the October 19 cabinet meeting, sources present at the meeting said.        
	Mukherjee is understood to have said the government could drop plans for an unprecedented expansion in central universities if it was proving difficult to execute.        
	The sources said Mukherjees comment was not a serious suggestion to scrap expansion plans, it was more of a barb at Sibal for the problems he was facing in launching the new universities.        
	The comment came in the backdrop of the HRD ministry seeking cabinet approval to promulgate an ordinance to set up a central university each in Kashmir and Jammu. The ordinance has been approved by the cabinet, signed by the President and notified.        
	Sibals reforms drive has been widely appreciated by educators but he has earned critics in sections of the Congress as well as some state governments that argue he is pushing his plans without adequate consultations. Sibal has, however, continued to enjoy support from Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi.        
	But launching new central universities has proved a battle for the minister over the five months he has been in charge of Indias education.        
	The UPA had, in the 11th Five-Year Plan, promised 16 new central universities, each in a state without a central varsity. Of these, 12 were planned as greenfield projects while four state universities were to be upgraded into central universities. Goa withdrew its state university from the upgrade project, leaving the Centre with 15 new central universities to handle.        
	Jammu and Kashmir was promised one of the 12 new universities, to be set up in Jammu. But protests alleging discrimination between the Kashmir and Jammu regions, which even rocked the Assembly, forced chief minister Omar Abdullah to approach Sibal demanding a second university.        
	Sibal agreed and under the ordinance, a second university will come up in Kashmir.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Dec. 19: An accused in the 26/11 terror case today filed a private complaint alleging that David Headley, in US custody for the same attack, was one of his foreign interrogators.         
	The plea from Sabahuddin Ahmed, accused of plotting maps of the five terror sites, came a day after Ajmal Kasab mentioned Headley in court.        
	Sabahuddin said he was questioned by five white police officers (implying foreigners), purportedly from the FBI. He mentions a lady officer, Mr Michael and Mr Jeff. There were two others and he said he heard people referring to one as Headley Sir and colonel, his lawyer said.         
	 Visa papers found        
	The visa application form of David Headley has been retrieved from the Indian consulate in Chicago, sources said.

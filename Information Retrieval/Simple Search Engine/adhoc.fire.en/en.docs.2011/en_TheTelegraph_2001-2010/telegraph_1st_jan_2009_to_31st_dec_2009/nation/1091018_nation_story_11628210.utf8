The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Scanner on pro-Maoist academics
                                                                                                               Scanner on pro-Maoist academics
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 17: The government is drawing up a list of academics from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and Jawaharlal Nehru University who it believes are Maoist sympathisers.        
	The CBI had put these senior doctors and professors under its scanner soon after the arrest of alleged CPI (Maoist) politburo member Khobad Ghandy last month. Agency sources say many students from across Delhi too are using their rented accommodation to shelter Maoists.        
	CBI sleuths claim these doctors and university teachers had helped Ghandy set up base in Delhi and recruit students from the capital.         
	They add that the agency has tracked two meetings in Delhi organised by the citys Maoist sympathisers to discuss Ghandys arrest.        
	The sources claim the CBI has documents to show that at least three AIIMS doctors, and many more Delhi academics and students, had visited Russia, China and Kazakhstan for ideological discussions. Its not clear, however, if arrests will follow.        
	When Delhi police applied in a city court on October 8 for an extension of Ghandys remand, they had said they were looking for three alleged Ghandy associates  two businessmen and a PhD student, Arvind Joshi.        
	The police application said Joshi, 27, who is from Haldwani in Uttarakhand, was believed to have hidden Ghandy at his rented quarters in the Badarpur area of south Delhi.        
	The police found nothing in Joshis rooms but claimed the student had removed a set of Maoist literature, documents, CDs, a laptop and the hard disk of another laptop as well as Rs 5 lakh from his quarters.         
	Officers said these claims were based on information that Ghandy allegedly provided during interrogation.        
	The police say they are on Joshis trail and would arrest him. The claims about Delhi-based sympathisers providing logistical support to the rebels come days after Union home minister P. Chidambaram asked civil society to stop romanticising Naxals and start judging them in the context of the mountain of (Maoist) violence.        
	On Thursday, an agricultural scientist who had briefly studied for a doctorate at Delhis Pusa Institute years ago was arrested for allegedly heading Maoist operations in Bihar and Jharkhand. His wife too was arrested.

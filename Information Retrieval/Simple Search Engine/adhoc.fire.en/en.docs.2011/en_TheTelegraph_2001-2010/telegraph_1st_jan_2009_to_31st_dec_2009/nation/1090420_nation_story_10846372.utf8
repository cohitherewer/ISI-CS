The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Low-cost route to victory, on buses
                                                                                                               Low-cost route to victory, on buses
          AJAY SUKUMARAN IN BANGALORE                        Gopinath on a bus in south Bangalore				                                 
	Buses plying south Bangalore routes have a special passenger these days  Captain G.R. Gopinath, Indias budget-airline pioneer whos trying out low-cost ways of winning votes.        
	As an Independent, hes hoping that would set him apart from the rest.        
	To be sure, his campaign looks different. No motorcycle outriders wielding party flags, no posse of party cars trailing road shows, no percussion bands and no mini-carpets of firecrackers laid out on the streets. Just some enthusiastic youngsters who look more like activists passing around pamphlets.        
	For the entrepreneur who built his airlines clientele from those who had never stepped inside an aircraft, his entry into Parliament depends on how he can get urban Bangalores reluctant voters to buy the idea of change.        
	Vote you must, vote for change, is his cry.        
	Our hope is, well draw a lot of support from people who dont (usually) vote, said Girish Rao, a friend whos running Gopinaths campaign, mostly through college students, working people, some senior citizens, NGOs and ex-servicemen. Many of these volunteers had had nothing to do with politics earlier but want to contribute, he added.        
	On a typical day, the team working from Gopinaths bungalow in upscale Vittal Mallya Road would draw up lists of youngsters available for the days electioneering, while a group of homemakers would run a parallel campaign, accompanying his wife Bhargavi on house visits.        
	When you have a good product, you dont need to hard sell it, said B. Venkatraman, 32, a Bangalorean whos taken a break from running an advertising firm to join Gopinath, whom he met at a voter facilitation centre that issues voter I-cards.        
	Gopinath isnt making any poll promises; hes assuring voters he would engage them in interactive sessions to formulate policy for the constituencys development. As a start, hes organising a citizens committee that will meet this weekend.        
	Some of it may wash over the common man. Who is he? asked a man at a roadside flower stall in Basavanagudi, a locality that symbolises old Bangalore, as Gopinath walked away after telling the vendors not to fall for election promises as colourful as the flowers they sold.        
	However, the man nodded knowingly when he heard about the airline that priced tickets as low as Rs 500.        
	Gopinath feels the movement hes aiming for has gathered momentum. I am saying, let me create the largest vote bank by uniting people.        
	He claims his website receives 30,000 hits a day and that he has sent out 4 lakh emails to voters. His media manager couldnt say how many calls Gopinath gets a day, but claimed he responds to calls, or texts people back, in the evenings after the days campaigning.        
	People ask him questions like what he would do when hes elected, how he would manage business and work. The army officer-turned-silk farmer-turned-airline owner is launching a cargo firm next month.        
	If I have volunteers I dont think (I need to spend) more than three to four hours a day, Gopinath told traders in Chikpet, a commercial hub.        
	When he started his campaign, he would engage people one-to-one, which meant he could only speak to a few people in a bus. His campaign team says he has slowly learnt to move faster, contacting more people.              
	 Bangalore South votes on April 23

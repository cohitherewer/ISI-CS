          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Oct. 3: Criminal proceedings in the Bhagirathi Das murder case have got a new lease of life with the Supreme Court upholding Orissa High Courts directive to police to initiate action against all the 19 people named in the FIR two-and-a-half years ago.        
	Das was murdered at Ichhapur village under Mangalpur police station in Jajpur in March 2007. His wife Kabita had filed an FIR naming Kedar Narayan Parida, his son and 17 others as accused.        
	Acting on her plea seeking judicial intervention against police inaction, the high court nearly a year later had found that the names of 12 of the 19 accused were dropped while filing a chargesheet by top police officers under political influence.        
	While the case was pending, former local BJD MLA Parmeswar Sethi had allegedly influenced the police into changing the mode of inquiry by the crime branch.        
	Later, Sethi had also gone to the extent of filing an affidavit before the court saying that two of the accused were present in his quarters at the time of murder. The high court, however, felt it was a case of unwarranted interference with the process of justice and directed the police to take action against all the accused. Subsequently, Parida and other accused had filed a special leave petition, challenging the high court order.        
	A Supreme Court division bench of Justices Altamas Kabir and Cyriac Joseph dismissed the appeal recently while upholding the high court directive. It was done to prevent injustice on account of the intervention of influential persons, which resulted in an attempt to shield some of the accused persons, the bench observed.

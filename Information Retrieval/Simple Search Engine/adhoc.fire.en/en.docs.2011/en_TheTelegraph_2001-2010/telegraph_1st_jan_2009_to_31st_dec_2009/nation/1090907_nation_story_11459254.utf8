          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Patna, Sept. 6: Armed robbers shot at a passenger and looted cash and jewellery from a Howrah-bound express train near Khusrupur in Patna, 40km from here last night.         
	Around 10 people, armed with pistols and rifles, barged into Danpur-Howrah Express at Khusrupur station around 11pm and robbed passengers in the coach meant for physically challenged people, government railway police (GRP) officers said.         
	The robbery has put a question mark on security forces efficiency, as a mob had burnt six coaches of an inter-city train at Khusrupur in June after which the GRP claimed that it had deployed more forces on long-distance trains.         
	After robbing passengers, the dacoits spread into other coaches. There were no security forces around, said Vishwakarma Sharma, who suffered a bullet injury on his leg and was admitted to Patna Medical College Hospital.         
	The men fired at Sharma, a handicapped schoolteacher hailing from north Bihars Chapra. Sharma was on his way to Calcutta. The train reached Bakhtiyarpur station at midnight when the GRP lodged an FIR on the basis of Sharmas statements.         
	The robbers got off when the train slowed at Bakhtiyarpur stations outer signal.         
	Patna GRPs deputy inspector-general Arbind Pandey said: Investigations are in progress. The Patna GRPs additional SP Suresh Choudhary has been assigned the case.

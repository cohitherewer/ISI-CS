          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 20: The Orissa government has instructed state builders to earmark 15 per cent of the houses to be constructed for economically weak sections.        
	Disclosing this at a seminar on the proposed comprehensive development plan prepared by the IIT-Kharagpur for Greater Bhubaneswar recently, state housing and urban development minister Badri Narayan Patra said his government was attaching priority to the provision of housing facilities to the economically weak sections and slum-dwellers.        
	Echoing Patras views, housing and urban development secretary Arun Kumar Panda said an affordable housing scheme would come up with the Centres support to provide homes for the economically weak section. He said that funds to the tune of Rs 50 crore each had been sanctioned by the Centre for Bhubaneswar and Puri under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission for payment of 5 per cent subsidy on the total project cost of a housing project to the builders for construction.        
	Panda said that the draft for the comprehensive plan for Bhubaneswar and its neighbouring towns designed to cater to the needs of a projected population of 30 lakh by 2030 had also provisions for housing economically weak sections and slum-dwellers.        
	According to the comprehensive development plan designed by IIT-Kharagpur for Greater Bhubaneswar, spread over an area of 400sqkm, the total housing requirement for 30 lakh people by 2030 would be 4.31 lakh dwelling units. The cost has been estimated at Rs 7,492 crore, which will be undertaken on a public-private partnership mode.        
	The CDP, which will require a total public and private investment of Rs 31,450 crore in the next 25 years, envisages housing for economically weak sections and slum-dwellers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Desperately seeking Nitish
                                                                                                               Desperately seeking Nitish
          NALIN VERMA                               
	Patna, May 5: JD(U) national spokesman and MP Shivanand Tiwari describes Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumars position as enviable in the run-up to the government formation at the Centre.        
	Tiwaris remark does not appear too off the mark, as both the Congress and the Left are working overtime to get Nitish Kumar in their post-poll scheme of things, while the BJP is making the moves to ensure that its 13-year-old ally does not desert the party.        
	What has inspired the Left, as well as the Congress, to woo Nitish Kumar is the belief that his party  JD(U)  might win around 20 of Bihars 40 Lok Sabha seats and Lalu Prasad-Ram Vilas Paswan combination may fare poorly.         
	Besides, Nitish Kumars success in roping in the minority community and maintaining distinct secular credentials despite sharing power with the BJP, makes him a more desirable ally for both the Left and the Congress. Moreover, the Left and the Congress, on basis of field feedback, seem to have perceived that the RJD-LJP combination might be reduced to a double digit figure and less, reducing Lalu Prasads strength in the post-poll scenario.        
	Nitish Kumar was not ready to attach any credence to Sheela Dixits recent remarks on television that the JD(U) leader had indicated his readiness to switch sides. But, sources do confirm that the Congresss remark was primarily a part of the partys tact to woo Nitish Kumar away from the BJP and the Left.         
	However, The Telegraph has learnt that Lefts interlocutors were trying to persuade Nitish Kumar to help broaden the Third Front base, in an attempt to make a non-Congress and a non-BJP government at the Centre or emerge as a front strong enough to have a dispensation in New Delhi on its term.        
	What has prompted Left and Congress is the fact that Nitish Kumar, shaped by ideology of J.P. Narayan, has been uncomfortable with the BJPs flaunting Varun Gandhi and Narendra Modi. He has distanced himself from the BJP on issues that demonstrate that he is not comfortable with hardline Hindutva. But, talking to The Telegraph, Nitish Kumar said: I am in NDA and JD(U)-BJP ties are 13 year old. The JD(U) will help L.K. Advani becoming PM.         
	In his dogged pursuit to keep Nitish in good humour Advani described the leader as the best chief minister in the country at an election rally.

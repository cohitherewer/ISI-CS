          ANANYA SENGUPTA                          In a spot                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 9: Seven doctors of Delhis premier Fortis hospital and its promoters have been charged with cheating and negligence after an apparently botched brain surgery put a patient back on the operation table where he died.        
	A court on Friday ordered police to file the case against the director of Fortis and Ranbaxy group, the hospitals medical director and six other doctors for Surendra Agarwals death on May 8, less than a week after his first surgery.        
	In his complaint, Agarwals son Ankit said his father, admitted to the Noida hospital on April 20 after recurring bouts of headaches, died because of wrong treatment.        
	My father was operated on May 2 by the doctors at Fortis who told me he had a tumour in his brain. After the operation, they informed us it wasnt a tumour but fungus that was the reason behind his headaches, the Meerut resident said.        
	After two days, the pain recurred and the doctors said it must be a tumour. He went under the knife again on May 8 when he died on the operating table. The hospital demanded Rs 4,60,000 as medical expenses.        
	Noida SP Ashok Tripathy confirmed he had received instructions from the court and registered a case of cheating and negligence against the director of Fortis and Ranbaxy Group, Malvinder Singh, medical director Manoj Rai Mehta and six other doctors.        
	Fortis officials refused to comment.

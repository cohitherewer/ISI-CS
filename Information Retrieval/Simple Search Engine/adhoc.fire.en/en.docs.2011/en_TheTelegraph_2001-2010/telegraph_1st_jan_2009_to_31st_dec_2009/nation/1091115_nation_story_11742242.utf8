          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 14: Dubbing China and US as the biggest dangers to world peace, veteran BJP leader and former Union minister Murli Manohar Joshi today said that India should expose the double face of the two great powers.        
	Referring to the reported revelation made by Pakistani nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan that China had supplied uranium and nuclear technology to Pakistan in the 80s, Joshi said though the US was fully aware of this fact, it was sitting mum and providing massive economic aid and weapons to Pakistan.         
	Joshi, who was in the city on a two-day visit to Orissa, also lambasted the UPA government for its failure to stabilise the price of essential commodities.         
	Strongly opposing the Vedanta University project being set up near Puri, Joshi said: Acquiring 6,000 acres of prime land belonging to Lord Jagannath and poor farmers for a university looks ridiculous. A big township in the name of university will be built and its a bonanza for builders.

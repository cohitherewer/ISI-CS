The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bihar polls over, Nitish embraces Modi   Unity show at biggest rally 
                                                                                                               Bihar polls over, Nitish embraces Modi     Unity show at biggest rally 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Narendra Modi with Nitish Kumar at the NDA rally in Ludhiana on Sunday. (PTI)                                        
	May 10: Three days after polling ended in Bihar, Nitish Kumar hugged Narendra Modi in public, shedding his apparent reluctance to be seen with a man he had refused to invite to his home state to campaign.        
	Nitish and Modi were among eight chief ministers today at an NDA show of strength in Punjabs largest city, Ludhiana, billed by L.K. Advani as the NDAs biggest rally since it was formed in 1998.        
	The Bihar chief minister got up from his seat on the dais when his Gujarat counterpart arrived. They shook hands, hugged and waved at the one lakh-strong crowd together.        
	Modi praised Nitish for his governance. For a while, they sat next to each other and were seen conversing off and on.        
	Nitish had been carefully protecting his image of a secular politician during the Bihar campaign as the Congress and the Left courted him. Today, he said there was no possibility of his being in touch with non-NDA parties, and asked the Biharis of Punjab to take revenge on the UPA government for letting Bihar down.        
	He alleged that on April 30, exactly 20 minutes after the end of polling in the flood-devastated Kosi region, the Centre had asked the state government to return the Rs 1,200 crore it had been provided as aid.        
	At 5.20pm, after the third phase of the polls, the Bihar government received a terse message stating the money sent as aid be returned. This is the kind of cruel joke the UPA government has played on Bihar, he said.        
	Prakash Karat sounded cold on Nitish, saying he had always been with the NDA, but his party seemed not to have given up hope.        
	There are parties in the NDA who are not communal, CPM politburo member Brinda Karat said, adding her party hoped for a post-poll realignment of forces in favour of the third front.        
	I am not talking about any single party or leader, Nitish or somebody else. But let the election be over and the numbers come out. Neither the Congress nor the BJP would be able to form the government, she said.        
	The Ludhiana rally comes three days before NDA-ruled Punjab goes to the polls. It was attended by BJP chief Rajnath Singh, Chandra Mohan Patowary (Asom Gana Parishad), Bimal Gurung (Gorkha Janmukti Morcha), Manoj Joshi (Shiv Sena) and Ajit Singh (Rashtriya Lok Dal). One surprise guest was Telengana Rashtra Samiti chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao, who said he had joined the NDA.        
	Advani said: This time we have corrected ourselves. We are confident of winning the polls. In 2004, we suffered from overconfidence.        
	Modi ripped into Rahul Gandhis remark that Parliament-attack accused Afzal Guru would be hanged when his time came. The Congress took only 15 minutes to hang the (Sikh) killers of General A.S. Vaidya (army chief during the 1984 storming of the Golden Temple) but when it comes to Guru, it says he will be hanged when his time comes. This is nothing but vote-bank politics.

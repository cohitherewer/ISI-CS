          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, Feb. 4: Gaya police discovered huge quantities of explosives this morning.         
	The gelatin sticks, officers suspect, were meant for rebel violence and were found from a Sumo Victa parked on the Grand Trunk Road under the red-hit Barachatti police station area of Gaya.        
	The explosives recovered weighed around 600kg. Some 4,000 gelatin sticks were seized from the raid. Superintendent of police Saurav Kumar pointed out that as little as two sticks were enough to cause major damage to property. The sticks bore labels that stated that they were manufactured in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh.         
	Three persons, including two deliverymen and a driver, have been arrested. Those nabbed are allegedly residents of Koderma and Ranchi and are now being interrogated by the police.         
	Andhra Pradesh, from where the explosives were supposedly brought, is a rebel-hit zone, with banned outfits such as MCC and Peoples War Group merging together to form CPI(Maoist) there.         
	On October 2, 2007, Gaya police also recovered explosives weighing around 155kg from two fibre-body water-containers buried near Kusha Tand under the Mohanpur police station area of the district. Again, on December 19, 2008, five tube-full of explosive gel, manufactured in a factory at Gomia (Jharkhand), were seized from Raghunathpur under Fatehpur police station area of the district.

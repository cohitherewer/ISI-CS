The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Delhi bus fires scald Tata firm
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Delhi bus fires scald Tata firm
  - Tata Motors fined Rs 4 crore, price held back        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                     
	New Delhi Dec. 14: The Delhi government has fined Tata Motors Rs 4 crore and will hold back Rs 150 crore for low-floor buses already ordered after six such vehicles caught fire.        
	They (Tata Motors) are responsible for the maintenance of the buses and we will not tolerate any sort of negligence on their part, chief minister Sheila Dikshit said after a meeting convened to discuss the fire incidents.        
	Six of the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) buses caught fire in the past three weeks, injuring a conductor, and the government was under pressure to take action. The Rs 150 crore being held back is the cost of 321 such buses to be delivered by March.        
	Of the Rs 10 crore to be paid to Tata Motors as annual maintenance charges for the low-floor buses, we have stopped Rs 4 crore as penalty, transport minister Arvinder Singh Lovely told the Assembly. He was replying to BJP leader V.K. Malhotras allegations of a scam in the bus deal.         
	A Tata spokesperson said this evening that he was not aware of the penalty, though sources said the companys representatives were likely to meet the chief minister.        
	The fleet is part of a contract worth around Rs 2,200 crore Rs 900 crore for the buses and Rs 1,300 crore for maintenance over 12 years Tata Motors won this year.        
	Around 10 per cent of the DTCs 993 low-floor buses are said to be faulty. Seventy per cent of the faulty buses have been grounded. Each bus costs Rs 52 lakh.        
	The action against Tata Motors came despite reports by the Supreme Court-appointed Environment Pollution Control Authority on the last three fires saying the DTC should share the blame.         
	The authority listed poor maintenance and manufacturing flaws as reasons, but said the DTC too had to ensure proper inspection before the buses left the depots. So far, only one depot manager has been suspended over the fires.        
	Dikshit, however, tried to ally safety fears by saying the people need not be worried about travelling in the buses as their technical snags were being rectified. She also said the preparations for next years Commonwealth Games, which include bringing in modern buses, wouldnt be affected by the problems.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 31: The government that has been closely monitoring the law and order situation in Kandhamal will review the same once more tomorrow  with the focus on the need for paramilitary forces in the area.         
	Last year, clashes from December 24 till January 3 had killed three persons and injured 34.         
	Talking to media today, chief minister Naveen Patnaik said he has discussed the matter with Union home minister P. Chidambaram already. I will review the situation tomorrow, he conceded.         
	The review meeting will take place prior to the chief ministers meet, scheduled on January 6, regarding security scenario in the country post-Mumbai. Another meeting would be held the next day regarding the Maoist menace.         
	Basing on the review, the Centre will be apprised about Kandhamal and retention of central paramilitary forces.         
	Christian leaders have been demanding deployment of central forces in Kandhamal and troubled areas till the completion of Assembly and Lok Sabha polls as they apprehend violence during the election.         
	Meanwhile, in a related move, the government has proposed to delete the word Kui from the list of 18 Kandha tribes in its effort to resolve the controversial caste certificate issue that had triggered riots in Kandhamal.         
	Sources in the chief ministers office said at a meeting of state-level tribal advisory council on January 19, it was resolved to delete the word from the list of Kandha tribes.         
	Kui was one of the 18 categories of Kondh tribes in the Scheduled Tribe list of the government.         
	Officials now state that Kui is a dialect that Kandha tribes speak and is not a name of any tribe.         
	It had been considered as a specific tribal group and figured in the list of tribals before this.         
	In Kandhamal, a section of SC community who converted to Christianity, reportedly obtained ST certificate by claiming that they were Kui tribals  since they spoke the dialect.        
	This created resentment among Kandha tribes against Christians Dalits who obtained the certificate and led to a riot-like situation in andhamal during 2007 Christmas.

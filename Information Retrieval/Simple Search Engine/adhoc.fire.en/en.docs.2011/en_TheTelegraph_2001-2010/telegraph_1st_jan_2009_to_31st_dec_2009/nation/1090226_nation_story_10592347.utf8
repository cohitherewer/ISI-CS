	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 25: The Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) has selected Manabendra Moharatha, a farmer from Orissa, for IARI National Award.        
	The 60-year-old farmer from Bhatapadagarh village in Khurda district was chosen for his outstanding contribution to enhance aquaculture productivity by converting an unproductive hilly terrain into a commercial fish farm.        
	With technological support by the Central Institute of Freshwater Aquaculture here, Manabendra constructed a series of 27 interconnected ponds on an area of 10 hectares to harvest and store rainwater from over 125 hectares catchment area on a hilly terrain.        
	I am very happy for the award. We currently produce 5-11 crores of carp spawn, 1.7 crores fry, 8 lakhs fingerlings, 3-5 tonnes yearlings annually and different fast growing food fishes to the tune of 3-5 tonnes per hectare per year through fish culture in harvested water, said Manabendra, beaming with the good news.        
	From no seed in the locality, Manabendras farm has become a fish-seed bank for the five districts. His exemplary skill and entrepreneurship have paid rich dividends. Manabendra now earns a net profit of Rs 8-9 lakh per year and employs 15 farmers.        
	His entrepreneurship has made him the most sought-after agri-aqua farmer in the area and he is approached by fellow farmers for information and advice. He is also extending technical knowhow to fish farmers in the region.        
	Congratulating Manabendra for his extraordinary feat, CIFA director A.E. Eknath said: The model developed by him is an example in itself, which can be replicated for increasing the agri-aqua productivity of unproductive hilly terrain of the country. His wisdom, skill and entrepreneurship need to be utilised on a wider scale for building capacity and leadership in farming communities.        
	Manabendra will receive the award from from Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar during the four-day Krishi Vigyan Mela starting in Delhi. Thousands of farmers, agri-preneurs (agriculture entrepreneur), extension workers, development officers, agro-industry personnel, scientists and students will participate in the fair.

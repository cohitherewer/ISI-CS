The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | AI puts cut on hold; pilots firm
                                                                                                               AI puts cut on hold; pilots firm
          PTI AND OUR CORRESPONDENT                          A stranded passenger at Delhi airport on Sunday. (PTI)                                  
	Sept. 27: Air India tonight put on hold the cut in productivity-linked incentives and decided to set up a committee to look into the issue that has triggered a strike by executive pilots.        
	However, Captain V.K. Bhalla, a representative of agitating executive pilots, told PTI in the capital: We will continue with our agitation. Pilots of Delhi, Calcutta and Chennai would be reporting sick.        
	He called as an eyewash the decisions by the management that met a delegation of pilots in Mumbai.        
	The Air India gesture came on the second day of the strike that forced the airline to cancel over 30 flights, inconveniencing passengers in the middle of the festival season.        
	The committee, comprising executive director (finance), executive director (industrial relations), general manager (operations in Mumbai) and four representatives of the executive pilots, will address the concerns of the agitating executive pilots over the cut in the incentives, Air India spokesperson Jitendra Bhargava told reporters.        
	The Air India chairman and managing director, Arvind Jadhav, held a four-hour-long meeting with a section of the agitating pilots stationed in Mumbai.         
	The chairman announced that the modalities of the incentives cut, whether 50 per cent or 70 per cent, would be looked into by the committee.        
	Bhargava said the problem (the agitation by the pilots) was caused by a September 24 order on the cut. The order is not applicable now, he said. The incentive slash is part of the cost-cutting drive at the airline, saddled with a loss of Rs 7,200 crore, to get a government bailout.        
	Cancellations during the day included four in Calcutta and seven international flights. Seventeen flights were cancelled in Delhi, and five each in Mumbai and Chennai, officials said. Yesterday, 12 flights were off.        
	Both sides put out conflicting cancellation figures  ranging from 26 to 50  to justify their positions. Bhargava said the carrier was trying to minimise inconvenience. We have cancelled flights on those sectors which have low passenger load or where alternative flights, by us or other airlines, are available. He also claimed passengers had been intimated about the cancellations and arrangements made for refunds.        
	But fliers complained of problems. Before leaving Calcutta for Jodhpur this morning, I confirmed whether my flight from Delhi to Jodhpur would go. I was told yes. Now they are saying it has been cancelled, said D. Chattopadhayay, travelling with family to Rajasthan for a vacation.        
	Lucknows Veena Gautam had to spend two days in Delhi before she was put on a flight to Chandigarh this afternoon. Many passengers spoke of problems in getting refunds.        
	Bhargava said daily seat availability had been reduced from 37,000 to 22,000, a sign the agitation had started hitting earnings at the loss-making airline.

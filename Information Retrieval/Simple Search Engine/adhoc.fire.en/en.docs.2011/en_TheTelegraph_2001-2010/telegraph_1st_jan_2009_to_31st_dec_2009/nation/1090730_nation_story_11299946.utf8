The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | In English summer, basked Indias last real queen
                                                                                                               In English summer, basked Indias last real queen
          AMIT ROY                              
	London, July 29: The Maharani of Jaipur was close to the British royal family as was her late husband, Jai. She came to the British Museum on the evening of May 26 for the reception to mark the inauguration of an exhibition of paintings from the Mehrangarh Trust in Jodhpur.         
	The Maharaja of Jodhpur, Gaj Singh, was there with his wife, Hemlata Rajye. So was Prince Charles, with Camilla. Gayatri Devi was confined to a wheelchair but she still looked beautiful.        
	The summer invariably found her in London, probably the place where she felt most comfortable after her beloved Jaipur. She would light a diya if she was called upon to do so at an Indian function. She would say very little in public, especially if she was watching a polo match.        
	Do you mind, Im watching a polo match, she cut short her hostess who was fluttering round her at a polo match, making sure all was well with the Rajmata.        
	She could be effortlessly haughty but those who got to know her appreciated this was just part of her character. After one polo game, she went round and talked to each of the players. Her interest was genuine, especially if Jaipur was involved.        
	Give me your number, Ill call you, she would say to any journalist who expressed an interest in interviewing her.        
	She would. She would pick up the phone, dial the journalist and invite him round though she would usually add she did not have much to say that would be of interest.         
	Although she was the Rajmata of Jaipur, she always wanted to do more for her native Cooch Behar.        
	She could very clearly remember a time when she and her late husband, Jai, could consider themselves to be socially on a par with the senior members of the British royal family.         
	This inevitably meant most Indians could not be her equal, maybe not even Indira Gandhi who decided there could not be two queens in India.        
	But curiously, Gayatri Devi, who remained royal even without the titles, did not want to wallow in the past. She could never be persuaded to be nostalgic about the past or to express the desire for things to have remained the same.        
	British holidaymakers who went to Rambagh would often see her float across the perfectly manicured lawns of the palace but she did not see it as her duty to hobnob with package tourists.        
	Judging by the impression she left in London, a place she obviously loved, her death removes probably the last real queen of India.

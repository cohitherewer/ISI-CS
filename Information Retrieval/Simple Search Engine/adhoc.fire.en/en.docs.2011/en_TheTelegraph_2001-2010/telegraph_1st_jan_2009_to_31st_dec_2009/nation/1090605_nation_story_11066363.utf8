          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, June 4: The rural development ministry has decided to carry out a national survey to assess the socio-economic impact of the employment guarantee scheme, realising the flagship programmes role in helping the UPA retain power.        
	The national rural employment guarantee scheme, launched in 2006, now covers all 615 districts of the country.        
	At a meeting of the Congress parliamentary party held immediately after the polls, a large number of MPs are said to have cited the goodwill earned by the NREGA as one of the most important reasons behind the coalitions victory.        
	The NREGA has become very crucial politically. It is all the more important now to have a good assessment of what is happening on the ground on a regular basis. Hence the survey, said a ministry official.        
	The survey, to be carried out by the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO), will be funded entirely by the rural development ministry. Expected to begin from next month, it will be titled NREGA  An impact evaluation Study.        
	In the first phase, the survey will be carried out in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh, states where the scheme was introduced initially. Other states will be covered later.        
	According to the module being prepared by the NSSO, a data inspector will visit 20 houses in every village that has registered under NREGA schemes. Questions will be asked to assess the socio-economic background of the family. The same houses will be re-visited after six months to assess changes in livelihood patterns. This process will continue for two years.        
	We are in the process of giving final touches to the schedule and the survey is expected to start by next month. We hope that the survey will help in assessing the status of the people, especially after the implementation of the NREGA, said NSSO associate director G. Sudhakar.        
	A ministry official said at least two chief ministers met rural development minister C.P. Joshi to give an overview of the employment schemes performance in their states and, of course, to seek more funds. Among them were the chief ministers of Punjab and Madhya Pradesh, Parkash Singh Badal and Shivraj Singh Chauhan, respectively.         
	While Badal, an ally of the BJP, underlined the need for liberal policies under the act, BJP leader Chauhan requested the rural development ministry to enhance the scope of the scheme in his state by increasing wages for the rural poor, especially in Bundelkhand, which is facing a drought.         
	The rural development and public relations minister of BJP-ruled Karnataka, Shobha Karandje, has also met Joshi.         
	We are being flooded with requests for appointments from state governments. It seems that after the elections, everyone has realised the political potential of the NREGA, said a rural development ministry official.

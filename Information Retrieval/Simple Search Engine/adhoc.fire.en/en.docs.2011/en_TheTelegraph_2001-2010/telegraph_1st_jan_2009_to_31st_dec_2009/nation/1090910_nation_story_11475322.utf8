	 Ahmedabad, Sept. 9: Gujarat High Court today stayed the magisterial report on the killing of Ishrat Jahan till November 30, finding it objectionable on many counts.          
	The court has also ordered an inquiry against S.P. Tamang, the metropolitan magistrate who penned the report, saying he was guilty of` impropriety as he had overstepped his jurisdiction.           
	The report had said Ishrat was killed in cold-blood by some Gujarat policemen who wanted to impress the chief minister and get promotions. The report, which named 21 cops, was yesterday rejected by the state government as being bad in law.          
	The stay on the report implies that its contents cannot be made public and neither can the petitioner, Ishrats mother Shameema Kausar, lodge an FIR based on it.                   
	 Srinagar: The Jammu and Kashmir government formally handed over the rape and murder case of Aasiya and Neelofar to the CBI for a thorough probe. Chief minister Omar Abdullah visited Shopian on Tuesday and called for the death penalty to those involved in the case.                   
	 Hisar (PTI): A chopper ferrying Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda from Delhi to Punjab was today forced to make an unscheduled landing in Haryanas Hisar because of inclement weather. Hooda later returned to Delhi by car.                  
	 Kanpur (PTI): Two students of Chandrashekhar Azad Agricultural University have been suspended for a year for locking up a girl inside an ATM kiosk on the varsitys premises. Ajit Tiwari and Saurabh Singh, both agriculture students, have not, however, been charged with ragging.                   
	 London: Four British teenagers have been charged with the murder of Calcutta-born careworker Ekram ul Haque.

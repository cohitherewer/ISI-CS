The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Paswan leads anti-Nitish war
                                                                                                               Paswan leads anti-Nitish war
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT       
	Patna, Aug. 6: His defeat from Hajipur at the Lok Sabha polls might have robbed Ram Vilas Paswan a seat in the lower House, but, the Dalit leader and LJP boss is fast emerging as the axes of anti-Nitish Kumar politics in Bihar.        
	I will like the Congress, the RJD and the Left to forget their differences and oppose communal forces led by the NDA in Bihar, he said in a recent interview. Grapevine has it that a section of Congress strategists tried to convince Paswan to tie-up with the party outfit without Lalu Prasad. He was also reportedly offered a Rajya Sabha seat by the Congress.         
	But, the LJP boss has so far steadfastly spurned every move to isolate the RLD boss. Paswans passion to keep a united front is being described as political logic. Despite a bad show, it was the RJD-LJP combination that stood second to NDA in 30 seats, while Congress nominees forfeited their deposits on over 30 of the 42 seats in the state.         
	An experienced campaigner Paswan feels that Congress, despite taking its vote percentage from six per cent to 13 per cent, has a long way to go, while the RJD with 27 per cent votes on its own, is a potent political force.         
	Asked if the Congress will be ready to do business with Lalu, Paswan said: I am sure that leaders will eventually appreciate the ground reality. A united front with Congress, RJD, LJP, Samajvadi Party and the Left, against the NDA is the need of the hour.         
	An otherwise loquacious Lalu Prasad appears to be in the stoop-to-conquer mood in the run up to the Assembly polls in 2010 and is happy playing second fiddle to Paswan.         
	The idea is that the RJD boss may have realised that voters are not ready to accept the return of Lalu-Rabri regime. And in such a situation, Paswan is a better bet.         
	For the past three days, the LJP boss has organised several attacks on the government on the Mahadalit and Muslim issues.         
	Now, LJP and RJD have decided to organise a joint rally on August 10 against the failures of the government.         
	Afterwards, Paswan will stay back in the state to organise a three-day cadre convention at Bodh Gaya.         
	Nitish Kumar has not faced real opposition so far. He will now get to witness it, Paswan told The Telegraph.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Roadshow plays to full house   Actor scores, politician   faces test
                                                                                                               Roadshow plays to full house 
  Actor scores, politician   faces test          CHANDRIMA S. BHATTACHARYA IN KRISHNAGAR                        Tapas Pal campaigns in Krishnagar. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha				                                             
	At 7.30am Tapas Pal, 51, is on the road, ready to be mobbed.        
	Freshly shaven, hair jet black, turned out in a green kurta true to the grassroots colour of his party and white churidar, and sporting a chain and several bracelets, the Trinamul Congress candidate from Krishnagar steps out of a three-storey building that has been home for a month and a half and jumps into the front seat of a maroon SUV.        
	The mob is ready too.         
	At the petrol station just outside Krishnagar town, the men leave the counter and charge at the car. Pal rolls the window down. The men shove their torsos in, trying to grab his hands, screaming: Aapni jitben! Aamra achhi aapnar sathe! (You will win! We are with you!).         
	Its hard to say where the actor ends and where the political candidate begins.         
	He knows that. All these crowds are here to see the filmstar, he says. At times, I am asked to repeat dialogues from my films, adds Pal, who debuted in Tarun Majumdars Dadar Kirti in the early 80s and became the sweetheart of the masses as the nave young do-gooder in film after film. The image stays on.         
	Pal is on his way to Tehatta, about 60km from Krishnagar town, where he will campaign during the day        
	The car is stopped again. A bus has halted on sighting him, and some of the crew and passengers have gheraoed the vehicle. Pal rolls down the window again.         
	This has been going on every day, for one-and-a-half months, he says, lighting a cigarette when the car starts to move and the AC is back on. Pal has been in Krishnagar since March 14.        
	He slaps on some sunscreen lotion. Is it showing? he asks the driver, who nods in approval. Never mind, says Pal. He doesnt need to care, it seems. Gram Bangla is witnessing an uprising every time Tapas Pal is in the vicinity.         
	The Krishnagar Lok Sabha constituency has seven Assembly and 90 gram panchayat areas and Pal, the sitting Trinamul MLA from Alipore, has been combing them. Throngs of hundreds wait for him at every street corner. His party thinks it will be a cakewalk. A Trinamul wave is sweeping through the villages, say party activists, and add to that Pals charisma.         
	It is more a snake than a wave. The car has veered into a narrow kuccha road. As Pal approaches the first village on his schedule in the Gobindapur panchayat area, a roar goes up. The entire village seems to have come out in one body, choking its dust-laden winding road like a gently moving monster serpent. Pal swings out of the door, his body hanging out, and waves at the crowd, filmstar style.         
	We did very well in the panchayat elections here  we hold 75 out of the 90 panchayats in the Krishnagar area. We are also confident of doing well in all the seven Assembly seat areas, says a district-level leader. In the Krishnagar Assembly seat segment, too, Tapas Pal will win, he says.         
	The actors chances are also helped by his main rival, sitting MP Jyotirmoyee Sikdar of the CPM, who has spent her last term largely being absent or caught up in controversies.         
	At a meeting on a ground next to a madarsa, slightly away from the clusters of jute-stick huts and harvested rice fields that look like Aamir Khans serrated head in Ghajini, Pal addresses a crowd of hundreds.         
	On stage, he is both actor and politician. I represent Mamata Banerjee and Sonia Gandhi, he declares. But he reminds them that he is the actor that his audience has loved. He is not in politics for money, for that comes from films. He is in politics to serve the people.         
	There should be change, embodied by Mamata Banerjee, he says. He will work for roads, health services, electricity. He will work for the improvement of madarsas. The other party has closed down factories. He will prove worthy of the peoples love.         
	But before that he will pass through four panchayat areas before lunch. Later it will be more gram panchayats. No one knows how many meetings it will amount to  for every scheduled meeting, about one every 10 minutes, there are three unscheduled stops.         
	At the next meeting, he refers to Nandigram, Singur, Tapasi Malik. The dead girl becomes a huge metaphor: Ora amader ma-boneder dhorshon korechhe. Ora amader jomi dhorshon korechhe. (They have raped our mothers and sisters. They have raped our land.)         
	The crowd goes berserk. Some follow him to the car, thrusting a freshly plucked green coconut into his hand. The men are more patronising, pledging Pal their support. The women laugh and scream and hang on, till he has smiled at them after catching their eye.         
	Will the crowds vote for him? Trinamul is in no doubt. Neither are many in the crowd. But some dont answer.         
	At a village in Pathure-ghat 1 gram panchayat, a woman says she has come to meet him just like that. Its 11am. She has been waiting for him under the blazing sun since 9am. Will she vote for him? She smiles and hides her face in her sari-end. Why has she come to see him? Shobai eshechhe tai(I came because everyone else did).         
	Such is the power of celebrity. Tapas Pal is a festival in Gram Bangla.         
	Having addressed about 30 meetings by around 1pm, Pal wipes his brow. I am feeling ill, he says. Only a few more meetings, coaxes the chief manager.         
	Pal has also developed a horror of flowers. So many of them had been pressed into him that he got a rash.              
	 Krishnagar votes on May 7

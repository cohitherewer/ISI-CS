                                                                                                               ISI talent scout held at city airport

	Calcutta, Sept. 20: A woman suspected to be a recruiter for Pakistans Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) was arrested this afternoon at Calcutta airport after being identified by immigration officials on the basis of a lookout notice.         
	The 37-year-old suspect has been identified as Jyoti Rana, alias Mehrunnisa, alias Nisha Sharma.        
	Rana came to the city from Bangkok on an Air India Express flight and was spotted while she was undergoing immigration clearance.         
	Immigration officials immediately detained her against the lookout notice for passport forgery and human trafficking cases lodged in Delhi.        
	She was later arrested and taken to the airport police station for interrogation.        
	Jyoti Rana is a Pakistani agent, based in Delhi, who recruits youths from various parts of India, including Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir, an intelligence official told The Telegraph.        
	These youths are taken in groups to Malaysia where they are given preliminary training in terrorism. They are then shifted to Pakistan, the official added.        
	Rana had apparently travelled to Malaysia frequently over the last few months with such groups of young men, other sources claimed.              
	The sources said a transit remand would be sought when she was produced in a local court on Monday morning. If the remand is given, she would be handed over to authorities in Delhi later in the day.

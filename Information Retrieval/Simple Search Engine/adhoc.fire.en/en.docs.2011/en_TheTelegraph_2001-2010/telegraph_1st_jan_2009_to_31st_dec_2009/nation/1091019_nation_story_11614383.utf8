The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bank faces blood shortage
                                                                                                               Bank faces blood shortage
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           Thalassaemia patients in a quandary                                  
	Cuttack, Oct. 14: Lack of doctors has thrown up a severe crisis at Central Red Cross Blood Bank here as collection dipped drastically leaving the administration in a tizzy trying to make ends meet.        
	The situation has worsened to such an extent that the bank has failed to provide blood to patients since Monday to registered thalassaemia patients.         
	There is always a demand, but collection dips when there are fewer donation camps. Things have worsened as conducting these camps outside the bank has not been possible in the past few months due to the absence of staff, said B. Pati, the bank director.         
	Central Red Cross Blood Bank in Cuttack, the largest in the state, can store 500 units of blood at a time.         
	The bank usually collects and handles around 100 units per day. However, the number has dipped to 30. In the past month, all three staff doctors engaged left their jobs and their posts have not been filled up.         
	With 370-odd thalassaemia patients registered under the bank, it requires at least 12 units every day. A Thalassaemia Transfusion Unit with 12 beds has been functioning since 2004 for blood transfusion to patients on all working days. We had to discontinue supply as there is an acute shortage. An emergency meeting of the managing board has been called, said the director. The bank collects around 36,000 units in a year. Eighty per cent of it comes from voluntary collection while the rest comes from replacement collection of units.                     
	The bank meets two-third of the requirement from SCB Medical College and Hospital and requirements of Acharya Harihar Regional Centre for Cancer Research and Treatment, Postgraduate Institute of Paediatrics, City Hospital, and the ESI hospital at Choudwar and government peripheral hospitals.         
	It provides free blood in lieu of voluntary donation under replacement collection category except for charging Rs 170 per unit towards transfusion cost. It also provides blood to private hospitals and nursing homes when sought, but charges Rs 350 per unit in addition to the transfusion cost.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | RJD spat stalls job plan
                                                                                                               RJD spat stalls job plan
          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, March 27: A plan to include urban projects under the rural job scheme has become a casualty of the Congress-Rashtriya Janata Dal spat over seat-sharing, government sources said.        
	Under the plan, villagers registered with panchayats under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme would have come to cities to work on sanitation and clean-up projects.        
	However, once the seat dispute broke out, the government decided against this extension of the scheme since the rural development ministry, which handles the scheme, is under the RJDs Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, a ministry official said.        
	We had been asked to fine-tune the proposal for implementing the scheme in cities and towns within a short deadline since the government had been keen on launching it before the elections, the official said. But then differences cropped up between the Congress and the RJD and everything went into a standstill.        
	The Centre, unable to find enough rural jobs for the guaranteed 100 days of work a year, had been under pressure from civil society groups to extend the schemes ambit to include city projects. It decided to do so and planned to announce the extension of the scheme in about a week, the official said.        
	Initially, there were fears of controversy since the poll dates had been announced. But the government argued this wasnt a new scheme, just the extension of an old one.

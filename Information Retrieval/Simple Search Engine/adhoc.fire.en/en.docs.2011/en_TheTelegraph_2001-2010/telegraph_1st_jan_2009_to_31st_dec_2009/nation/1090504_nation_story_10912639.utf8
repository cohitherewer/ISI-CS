The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Red nurtures harvest hope in desert green belt
                                                                                                               Red nurtures harvest hope in desert green belt
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI IN GANGANAGAR (RAJASTHAN)                          A CPM campaign vehicle in the Ganganagar constituency                                  
	Vegetable vendor Arvind Meghwal craned his neck to identify the flag fluttering above the approaching campaign auto-rickshaw as it belted out old Bollywood songs filmed on Manoj Kumar playing the honest, hard-working farmer.        
	As the flag  red, with a white insignia on it  became visible, Meghwal nodded in recognition. This is the campaign vehicle of the comrades, he said.        
	This is recognition the CPM has won through two decades of work in the northern districts of Rajasthan, and which has peaked in the course of an ongoing peasant agitation for irrigation water.        
	It may be time to begin reaping the harvest.        
	The CPM may be expected to lose several seats in its bastions in Bengal and Kerala, but the green belt of this desert state is promising the party its best opportunity since 1989 to realise its stated dream of spreading its reach to northern India.        
	The districts of Hanumangarh, Ganganagar, Churu, Jhunjhunu, Sikar and the northern segments of Bikaner comprise the bread basket of Rajasthan, productive and fertile thanks to the Indira Gandhi canal. Wheat, cotton and mustard are the principal crops here.        
	Hanumangarh and Ganganagar together form one parliamentary constituency  Ganganagar  while each of the other districts broadly maps a constituency.        
	Like all other areas of this state, electoral battles here too have been limited to a Congress-versus-BJP fight since the latter first won in this state in 1989.        
	But this year, the CPM is emerging as a serious contender in two of these seats  Sikar and Bikaner  and has the potential to spoil the Congresss chances in Ganganagar, according to Congress and BJP leaders.        
	In both Sikar and Bikaner, the CPM has fielded candidates who won Assembly elections last December.        
	Amara Ram, central committee member, is the CPM candidate from Sikar, where he is contesting against sitting BJP MP Subhash Maharia and the Congresss Mahadev Singh.        
	Pawan Duggal, a young party activist who has led the peasant agitation in Ganganagar district for better water supply for the past five years, is the CPM candidate from Bikaner.        
	Duggal is the MLA from Anupgarh, an Assembly constituency that is in Ganganagar district but falls in the Bikaner parliamentary constituency.        
	It is because of the partys work with the farmers battling for water that people are getting attracted to us, Duggal said.        
	The water war between farmers and the administration is a result of the government extending the Indira Gandhi canal towards Jaisalmer in western Rajasthan without increasing the water inflow, leading to reduced availability here.        
	There are more seats to be won in western Rajasthan than here. The Congress and the BJP calculate that it is fine to lose here if they can win western Rajasthan through the politics of water, alleged a senior CPM state leader at the Anupgarh party office.        
	The turning point in the farmers agitation came in 2004, when police under the then BJP state government opened fire on protesting peasants in Gadsana village, 22km from Anupgarh. Six persons, including a student, died in the firing, which sparked violence that saw police vehicles and offices set on fire.        
	Sheopat Ram, the partys third candidate from this belt, is contesting from Ganganagar, where CPM workers admit that he is unlikely to win, but add that he could eat into anti-BJP votes.        
	The firing didnt affect just Gadsana or Anupgarh. It hit farmers across this agricultural area like a bolt. Even today, we remind voters here of the BJPs track record in tackling farmers concerns, said Dhuramal Swami, the CPMs senior-most leader in Ganganagar.        
	If the CPM does register an upset, it will not be the partys first-ever win here. In 1989, Shopat Singh Makassar won the Bikaner seat with 42.99 per cent votes.        
	But since that victory, the partys fortunes in Bikaner constituency have dipped sharply, its candidates winning 13.22 per cent votes in the 1991 elections and just 2.87 per cent in 1998. The CPM has not contested in Bikaner since 1998.        
	It has chosen to enter the fight this time  but a repeat of 1989 may not be impossible.              
	 Ganganagar votes on May 7

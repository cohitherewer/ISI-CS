          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 10: Imposing levies on companies and governments for felling forest trees had swelled the Supreme Courts kitty to about a fourth of Bengals total budget outlay, starting a fight with the Centre on who gets to use the money.        
	Today the apex court ended the years of wrangling over the fund of Rs 11,300 crore by releasing Rs 1,000 crore for the states  to plant trees. Each states share would depend proportionally on the amount collected from within its territory.        
	The court had collected the money mainly since 2002, from government departments and public and private sector companies, in the form of stiff levies for their use of forest land.        
	This wasnt exactly a fine since the users werent being punished for failing to carry out compensatory afforestation. Rather, it was a sort of fee being charged beforehand so the money could later be used to increase Indias forest cover.        
	The funds now lie with an ad hoc body created by the apex court, called the Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (Campa). From this, the court will release Rs 1,000 crore  almost five times the environment and forests ministrys budget  for the states every year for five years.        
	The amount is equivalent to the yearly interest the court earns from the Rs 11,300-crore core fund.        
	The Centre had earlier questioned whether the court had the power to levy such fees and if it did, whether it could spend the funds as well.         
	It had claimed that finances lay entirely in the domain of the executive and that the court had no power over the spending of the money. It had tried to wrest the funds several times and failed.        
	Eventually, the previous UPA government introduced a bill to create Campa to use these funds, but the bill lapsed. The court then set up its own, ad hoc Campa to handle the money.        
	In May 2006, the court asked the environment and forests ministry to submit schemes to Campa relating to the various states, but to no avail.        
	Last Monday, however, the ministry said it had asked all the states to set up state-level Campas to handle the funds, and issued them with guidelines on how the money was to be spent.        
	The Centre, in an application, sought urgent release of the funds so that no more planting seasons were lost. Today, the court relented.        
	Under the central guidelines, the funds can be used to preserve wildlife and protect their habitats.        
	The Chief Justice, who heads a three-member green bench that hears forest-related cases every Friday, has advised the states to carry out the afforestation as part of their rural job guarantee schemes.

      35 DAYS TO GO*                              
	Srinagar: The PDP will contest all six Lok Sabha seats in Jammu and Kashmir.          
	After losing partner Congress to rival National Conference  the two now run a coalition government in the state  the PDP had been expected to join the Third Front. But patron Mufti Mohammad Sayeed said his party would contest all the six seats on its own. There is no question of joining the Third Front or aligning with anyone, he said.          
	Although relations between the PDP and the Congress have strained, Mufti does not want to burn all his bridges with his ally-turned-foe, the reason it prefers to go alone in the elections.          
	He is keeping options open for post-poll alliances. We will weigh our options only after the polls, he said.           
	 New Delhi: Sacked CPM lawmaker A.P. Abdulla Kutty will join the Congress and campaign for the party in Kerala.          
	The 42-year-old MP from Kannur, expelled last week for praising Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi, announced his decision after a meeting with defence minister A.K. Antony on Thursday.          
	Abdulla Kutty had earlier met the Congresss Kerala chief, Ramesh Chennithala, and Opposition leader Oommen Chandy.          
	I met Antony this morning. I decided to support the Congress to keep communal and fascist forces out of power. I will campaign for the Congress in Kerala, Abdulla Kutty said. Asked whether he would contest, he said he had not given it a thought.          
	 Hyderabad: Many former bureaucrats are seeking to test their electoral fortunes from Andhra Pradesh in the coming polls.          
	So far, however, only the candidature of former bureaucrat N. Jayaprakash Narayan, who floated his Lok Satta Party over two years ago, has been declared. Telugu star Chiranjeevis PRP has as many as seven former IAS officers.          
	K.S.R. Murthy, who had joined the Congress, is getting ready to seek re-election from the Amalapuram (reserved) Lok Sabha constituency. K.V. Rao, who quit the IAS in 2007, is eyeing Anakapalle, while Thota Chandrasekhar, who joined the PRP in August 2008, is staking claim to Guntur.          Among those seeking Assembly tickets are retired officers Uma Malleswara Rao and C.V. Narasaiah.

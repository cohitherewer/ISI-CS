                                                                                                               Varuns FIR plea rejected
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, March 25: Allahabad High Court today turned down Varun Gandhis plea to quash an FIR against him for his alleged hate speech, setting the stage for a legal challenge in the countrys top court.        
	The division bench has not entertained the prayer for a stay on the FIR. But we would move the Supreme Court to file an appeal against this order, the BJP candidates lawyer, G.S. Chaturvedi, said.        
	The division bench of Justices Imtiyaz Murtaza and S.C. Nigam said there was no need for a stay on the FIR as Delhi High Court had already granted Varun anticipatory bail, valid till March 27.        
	The Allahabad court also said the CD that recorded Varuns speech in Pilibhit early this month did not, on the face of it, seem to have been doctored, and it was up to police to verify and find out the truth behind his allegation that it had been tampered with.        
	So Varuns petition to quash the FIR filed against him by the Election Commission stands disallowed and dismissed.        
	In his petition, Varun  alleged to have said if anyone lifted a hand against Hindus, he would cut off that hand  had questioned the charges against him under sections of the IPC and the Representation of the People Act.        
	The charges, among them promoting enmity between different groups on the ground of religion, carry a maximum punishment of three years in jail or a fine or both.        
	Police officers in Uttar Pradesh said the case being sensitive, they would wait for the Supreme Courts decision.

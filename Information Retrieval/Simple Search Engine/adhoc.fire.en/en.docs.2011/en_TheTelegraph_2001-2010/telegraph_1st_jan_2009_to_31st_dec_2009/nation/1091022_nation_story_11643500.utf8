The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lucre or love? Mystery shrouds shelved Indian Summer
                                                                                                               Lucre or love? Mystery shrouds shelved Indian Summer
          OUR BUREAU                        Jawaharlal Nehru and Edwina Mountbatten                                
	Oct. 21: Indian Summer, a Hollywood film based on Jawaharlal Nehru and Edwina Mountbatten, has been shelved, leaving behind a mystery on what the film-makers found too hot to handle: money or Indian prudes.        
	The film was supposed to focus on one of the most sensitive chapters of the final days of the Raj  the relationship between Indias first Prime Minister and the wife of Britains last Viceroy.        
	Universal Pictures, among Hollywoods oldest studios, has postponed plans for shooting, apparently because of the scale of the budget, thought to have been between $30 million (Rs 138 crore) and $40 million (Rs 184 crore).        
	Sources said director Joe Wright considered making the film, Indian Summer, starring Cate Blanchett and Hugh Grant, for less than $30 million, before deciding to wait for more favourable market conditions.        
	Wright, however, told Variety magazine: We were in between a rock and a hard place. The Indian government wanted us to make less of the love story while the studio wanted us to make more of the love story.         
	He added that the Indian government had given permission for shooting the film only if physically intimate scenes were removed.        
	In Delhi, an information and broadcasting ministry official confirmed that the Indian government had given clearance to the film early this month after the makers had agreed to tone down the relationship between Nehru and Edwina after its earlier disapproval.        
	All foreign films shot in India must be approved by a vetting committee, which screens the script to make sure nothing detrimental to the image of India or the Indian people is shot or included in the film.                        Hugh Grant and Cate Blanchett       
	We had okayed the script after the filmmakers agreed to tone down the sequences involving Nehru and Edwina Mountbatten, the official said.        
	Wright, whose credits include Pride and Prejudice, had announced plans to start filming on location in India next year, with Blanchett playing the unconventional aristocrat and Grant her husband.        
	Slumdog Millionaire star Irrfan Khan was in the running to play Nehru but there has been neither any confirmation nor denial.        
	The film is based on Alex Von Tunzelmanns book Indian Summer, The Secret History of the End of Empire, which tells the story of Nehru and Edwinas friendship during the Mountbattens return to India for the handover of power and Partition in 1947.        
	But the nature of Nehru and Edwinas relationship is still hotly contested in India, where many prefer to believe the lonely widower and the vicereine were devoted but platonic friends.        
	There were concerns over how intimate the portrayal of the relationship between the two characters based on Nehru and Edwina should be.        
	Filmmaker Sudhir Mishra sees no reason why the Indian government had to interfere. People should be allowed to make films because I believe that all films are interpretations of truth and a work of fiction. The filmmaker is making no claims of presenting truth to the audience; merely his interpretations are shown on celluloid. Nehru is too great a man to be affected by one movie, says Mishra who has written screenplays for critically acclaimed films like Chameli and Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro.                    WITH A REPORT FROM THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

	Patna, Aug. 30: The Bihar government will beef up security in long-distance trains passing through disturbed areas of the state in the wake of several attacks on railway property and passengers in recent times.         
	This decision taken by police administration also precedes a letter to this effect written by railway minister Mamata Banerjee to Union home ministry and Bihar government. The state has decided to appoint 1,500 special auxiliary police (SAP) after training them to guard both travellers and railway property.         
	The government, with help from Union home ministry, will also open police outposts in railway stations situated in sensitive areas and Maoist zones.        
	State director-general of police Anand Shankar has approved both the proposals. The model police stations, according to the DGP office, will be equipped with state-of-the-art communication facilities, women officers and restrooms for passengers.         
	Anand Shankar said that the police administration have decided to increase the number of escort parties on trains passing through rebel-dominated areas after Mamatas letter. Keul-Jamalpur, Gaya-Gajandi, Gaya-Mughalsarai and Patna-Gaya sections have been described as disturbed and extremist affected in polices strategy papers. Besides, top brass has instructed GRP to engage officers in the rank of SP and DIG to supervise investigation and carry out vigorous crackdown on troublemakers.         
	As a part of this effort, Patnas DIG (railways) Arbind Pandey has been supervising the case in which four coaches of Shramjivi Express were torched at Bihta on August 18. Pandey said his team has identified 26 people who constituted the so-called group of students, responsible for the arson, and two have been arrested. He said the team would arrest all 26 culprits.         
	Last night, robbers killed passenger Mukesh Mandal at Mohanpur near Jhajha railway station when the latter refused to part with his mobile phone.         
	They looted property worth Rs 50,000 from passengers of Patna-Jhajha passenger on Jamui-Keul section of Eastern Railway 250km from here.        
	GRF have registered a case and investigations are on, said DIG Arvind Pandey. Passengers staged angry demonstrations at Jhajha and Keul railway stations today protesting against the robbery.         
	The robbers opened fire in the running train as it left Mohanpur station creating panic at 11pm.        
	The train had no security. GRP officers said Mukesh Mandal, a resident of Maheshleta village in Lakhisarai, resisted the men refusing to part with his mobile phone following which he was shot from close range.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Naveen govt fails on agri loan promise
                                                                                                               Naveen govt fails on agri loan promise
          SUBRAT DAS                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 14: The electoral promise of the ruling BJD to provide agricultural loan to farmers at 3 per cent interest rate as against the Centres 7 per cent remains half-fulfilled with the government deciding to peg the interest rate at 5 per cent for the current Kharif season.        
	Agriculture and co-operation minister Damodar Rout said the government had decided to continue giving crop loans to the farmers at 5 per cent interest rate during the current Kharif season as against 7 per cent interest rate fixed by the UPA government at the Centre.        
	We have set a target to provide crop loan of Rs 1,500 crore and term loan of Rs 300 crore to the farmers through the co-operative sector during the current Kharif season, he said. With the reduction in interest rate on crop loans, we hope more farmers are expected to avail it this time, said Rout.        
	During the last Rabi season  October 1, 2008 to March 31, 2009  the earlier BJD-BJP coalition government had revised the interest rate on crop loans from 7 per cent to 5 per cent to woo the farmers ahead of the polls.        
	In fact, the BJP was holding the co-operation portfolio, responsible for disbursement of crop loan, in the coalition government. But it failed to take any political mileage from the crop loan interest revision in the recent election.        
	Competing with the Congress-led UPA government at the Centre, which had announced farm loan waiver, the BJD promised in its election manifesto to provide crop loan at a rate of 3 per cent interest as against the Centres 7 per cent.        
	The BJD has also drawn flak from the Opposition parties for its failure to fulfil its electoral promise. The ruling party has apparently taken the people for a ride, alleged state Congress chief spokesperson Kailash Acharya.         
	Providing crop loan at 5 per cent interest rate is nothing new. Its just continuance of decision of our government, said BJP leader Surama Padhy, who was co-operation minister in the BJD-BJP coalition government.        
	Rout, also the BJD secretary general, said: We will try to further reduce it to 3 per cent during the next crop year.

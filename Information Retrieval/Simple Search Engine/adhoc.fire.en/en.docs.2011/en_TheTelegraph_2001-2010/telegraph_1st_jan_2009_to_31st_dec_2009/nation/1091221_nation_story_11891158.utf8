The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Racket beats UK student points rule 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Racket beats UK student points rule 
                            
	London, Dec. 20 (PTI): Thousands of young Indians, mainly from Punjab, are entering Britain on falsely obtained student visas, a media report claimed today.        
	Undercover reporters found foreign agents offering would-be students loans of 10,500 (over Rs 7.8 lakh) each so they could convince the UK Border Agency in their visa applications that they had enough money in their bank account to pay fees and support themselves in Britain.        
	The money is handed back to the lender as soon as it appears on bank statements for a month, said the Sunday Times, London. The cost to the student is a 7 per cent interest charge and a 200-processing-fee, which work out to around 935 (over Rs 70,000). In a covertly filmed investigation, the newspaper claimed it had established that the scam was operating widely in towns in Punjab.        
	It threatened to undermine new home office immigration rules which ministers insisted would reduce the number of new arrivals.        
	Instead, the number of visas granted to Indian students has nearly doubled in the past year, from 29,000 to 52,000. According to the report, many of them have no intention of studying and disappear after entering the UK.        
	The new points-based entry system was created by Liam Byrne, the former immigration minister and now chief secretary of the treasury.         
	Students need 40 points to enter Britain. They receive 30 for holding a course offer from a college or university and 10 for proving that they can pay fees and support themselves.        
	The report quoted Vikram Choudhri, a counsel for the chief minister of Punjab, as saying: Thousands of students are going to the UK every year to work and earn there. Their main motive is to go and settle and very few go to universities. Under the new rules, students have to show they have 7,200 (Rs 5.4 lakh) in their bank accounts plus the first years fees for a course in London, or 5,400 (over Rs 4 lakh) plus a years fees for a course outside the UK capital.

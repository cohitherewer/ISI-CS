The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Power cut bill put at Rs 30000cr
                                                                                                               Power cut bill put at Rs 30000cr
                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 25 (PTI): Indians spend Rs 30,000 crore every year on fuel and maintenance of power back-up equipment to secure themselves against frequent outages.        
	According to a pan-Indian study commissioned by power equipment maker Wartsila India, titled The Real Cost of Power, the expenses on power generation using inverters, generators and other back-up tools are almost 80 per cent more than what consumers pay on grid supply (regular supply from utilities).        
	The operational expenses on generating back-up power in the country are estimated to be around Rs 30,000 crore every year, the study says.        
	It says a consumer on an average spends 80 per cent above the grid cost when faced with 6-7 hours of load-shedding everyday and the cost increases three-fold if appliances like fridge and TV are run on back-up.        
	On the correlation between the growth of the gross domestic product and power generation capacity, the study suggests that the growth rate for both should be same.        
	Wartsila India managing director Rakesh Sarin, releasing the study, said a reliability surcharge of as little as 50p per unit can support rapid (power generation) capacity build-up in the country.        
	This surcharge would be far less than the extra charges consumers incur on back-up equipment, Sarin added.        
	The study was carried out over a five-week period in May-June 2009 and covered 1,500 respondents across 21 cities.

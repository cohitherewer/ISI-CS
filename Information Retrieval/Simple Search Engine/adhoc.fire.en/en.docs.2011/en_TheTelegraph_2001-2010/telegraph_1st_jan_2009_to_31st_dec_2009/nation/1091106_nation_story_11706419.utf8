The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Salim to dump Anarkali, but rivals bay for blood
                                                                                    Friday , November 6 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Salim to dump Anarkali, but rivals bay for blood
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Sushma Swaraj blesses Janardhan Reddy (right) and Karnataka health minister B Sriramalu.                                   
	New Delhi, Nov. 5: Anarkali is ready to leave but the dissidents are still asking for Salims head.        
	Karnataka minister Shobha Karandlajes exit seems almost certain but BJP leaders were not yet sure whether the resignation of chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappas confidante would buy peace with the recalcitrant Reddy brothers of Bellary.        
	A few things still need to be sorted out. Till we come to the end of talks with both sides, nothing can be said. But the talks are progressing positively, a source said.        
	Earlier this week, a source had hinted at a solution to the standoff over flood relief efforts by quoting a line from the film Mughal-e-Azam  Hindustan ka takht chahiye ya Anarkali (Do you want to rule Hindustan or covet Anarkali?)?        
	It was the choice Akbar had ordered Salim (later Jehangir) to make when he found out that his son was besotted with the courtesan.        
	A PTI report from Bangalore today quoted Karandlaje, who has put off many ministers and MLAs, as saying: If the party wants me to quit, I will oblige.        
	Yeddyurappa tonight agreed to drop Karandlaje, a Karnataka source said, but the Reddys also want three or four ministers axed. The chief minister apparently said nothing doing. Yeddyurappa also wants Karandlaje rehabilitated as state party chief, but the suggestion was rejected outright by the central leadership.        
	With peace slow in coming, the chief minister has been told to stop talking tough.        
	Yeddyurappa, who landed in the capital last night, was firmly told by the BJP brass that if he wanted to keep his job, he should stop threatening disciplinary action against the Reddy brothers. Two of the brothers  all mining magnates  are ministers in Yeddyurappas government and the third is a legislator.        
	The Reddys dont come within the ambit of indiscipline, a senior leader said.        
	Yeddyurappa was also told not to demoralise the MLAs by warning of an early election as a way of shaking off the Reddys. He was reminded that the simple majority he had was possible only because the Reddys had weaned away the six legislators he required.        
	A source said Yeddyurappa might believe he would get another term on the sympathy factor. But voters will not be kind to him every time.        
	Yeddyurappa, who earlier shared power with Deve Gowdas Janata Dal (S), had gone to voters saying he needed another term to complete unfinished work after the former Prime Ministers party had pulled out.        
	A sign of things to come was the refusal of one of the Reddy brothers, K. Janardhan, to meet Yeddyurappa despite requests from party veteran Sushma Swaraj whom he reveres as mother.        
	I will not meet the CM, he told reporters today after a meeting with Sushma. Why should I meet him?        
	Yeddyurappa was also advised to be objective about flood relief management and not get worked up if the Reddys wanted to start a parallel relief enterprise.        
	He cant have double standards, a source said, alluding to Yeddyurappas move to virtually outsource his governments flood relief endeavours to a Bangalore-based corporate honcho, who is also an MP.        
	This morning, BJP chief Rajnath Singh convened a meeting of senior colleagues Sushma, M. Venkaiah Naidu, Arun Jaitley and Ananth Kumar.        
	Yeddyurappa was asked to join later with Karnataka BJP chief Sadanand Gowda. There are some outstanding issues that will hopefully be resolved soon. But leadership is not an issue, Rajnath told reporters later.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | After Satyam lie, birth date fudge tumbles out
                                                                                                               After Satyam lie, birth date fudge tumbles out
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                          Ramalinga Raju                                  
	Hyderabad, Jan. 21: The humiliation could not have been more stinging for the fallen software czar.         
	Ramalinga Raju, did you fudge your date of birth? In school records, was one of the first questions casually put to the disgraced Satyam boss by an interrogator from the state CID. It is September 16, 1954, in some records and December 16, 1954, in some others, he pointed out.         
	Raju did not speak for 15 minutes. When the answer came, it was almost a whisper: Please go by the date of birth in my passport.         
	The former Satyam chairman is being interrogated since Sunday at the office of the economic offences wing of the CID. Till 10am tomorrow, Raju and his erstwhile chief financial officer Srinivas Vadlamani will have to respond to queries from the investigators, many of whom have been trained by Scotland Yard.         
	The location of the CID office would not have been lost on Raju. Barely 300 yards away is the AC Guards barracks, notorious for its torture cells housing thieves and cheats during the reign of the Nizams.        
	Raju was informed of the dangers of misleading, giving wrong answers or even being indifferent. This is more like a Kaun Banega Crorepati game. The more you cooperate, the fewer bad marks. But you get good scores only if you give proper and relevant answers to the questions, the investigators told him.        
	You should understand that we almost know everything  the modus operandi, processes, persons and also exact numbers of accounts and money. All we want you is to corroborate and also explain yourself, they said.        
	Raju, sources familiar with the questioning said, has admitted to a large extent on the land bought for Maytas. It was my strategy  a buffer plan to hold on in the market in the event the US turned totally against outsourcing, an eventuality we all feared, Raju is learnt to have told his interrogators.        
	How did he amass so much land in such a short time and did not encounter opposition from political outfits and landsharks?        
	You are either nave or pretending to be one, he is learnt to have told his interrogators. I had the full backing of the powers-that-be (in the administration). Otherwise, I could not have accumulated so much land in such a short period. I should say those in government departments openly supported our activities since they knew who were behind us. The land registration offices worked overtime and sometimes even on Sundays for our benefit. Of course we took care of the peripherals (transport, food and also entertainment) for those who were working for us.         
	But Raju, so far, has not named any person or party.        
	Naming people or parties will not help. I am also not naming which period either. I was given full access since they had confidence in whatever we were doing both before 2004 (when the Congress came to power defeating the Telugu Desam) and also now, he said.        
	Investigators contend that Raju is still not revealing all. He is diplomatic and also feigns ignorance. For example, he does not explain how he paid for the land deals. Whether he used Satyam funds for that, said an official.        
	Raju, the officials said, is sticking to his stand that he hasnt taken any money for personal gain. I am not a thief. I have not taken any money from Satyam that did not belong to me. You can check everything, is his refrain.        
	His interrogation room is in an isolated section inside the three-storeyed complex and has been painted greyish blue, just like his personal chamber in the Satyam office or his bedroom in the Jubilee Hills bungalow. We wanted him to relax and also to be on familiar ground so that he was not under any pressure and also could do more soul searching, said a senior official. But he has to sleep in a 10x10sqft room without a toilet.         
	On Sunday, they allowed Raju to rest after a decent lunch that included fish curry, his favourite dish, and fried prawns, his first non-vegetarian meal since January 11 when he was put behind bars.

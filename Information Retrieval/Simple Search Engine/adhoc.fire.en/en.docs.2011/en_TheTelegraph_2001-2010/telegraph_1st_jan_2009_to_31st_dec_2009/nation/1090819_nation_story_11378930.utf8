          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Aug. 18: Orissa High Court today fixed August 20 for hearing the petition of mines director R.N. Sahoo in connection with the multi-crore mining scam seeking anticipatory bail.        
	The state vigilance, which on August 7 had submitted a preliminary report to the government on its investigation into the scam, has since been trying to track Sahoo to interrogate him in connection with smuggling of manganese worth nearly Rs 110 crore from mines in Keonjhar.        
	While Sahoo had filed his anticipatory bail plea, seven other officials had moved the high court after the Balasore chief judicial magistrate had refused to grant them bail on August 13 and remanded in judicial custody till August 23.        
	Justice R.N. Biswal declined hearing arguments on the anticipatory bail petition by the director of mines when it was mentioned in his court today. In fact, he also refused to hear the bail petitions of the seven officials accused in the case that had exposed deep-rooted corruption in the mining department.        
	Justice Biswal referred the petitions to acting Chief Justice I.M. Qudussi.

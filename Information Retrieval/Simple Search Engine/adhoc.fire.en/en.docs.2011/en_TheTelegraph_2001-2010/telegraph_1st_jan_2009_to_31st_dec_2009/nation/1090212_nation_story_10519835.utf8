The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Letter fuel to Vijayan case
                                                                                                               Letter fuel to Vijayan case
          JOHN MARY                              
	Thiruvananthapuram, Feb. 11: A letter purportedly written by a CPM politburo member before his death could come into focus when the partys top body discusses the corruption case of Kerala boss Pinarayi Vijayan this weekend.        
	E. Balanandan, who died last month and was also a Citu leader, had written to party bosses on the 1996 SNC Lavalin scam in which the CBI has named Vijayan and 11 others.        
	Balanandan was the head of a state panel that had recommended a deal for modernisation of three power plants be given to BHEL, a central government company.         
	Vijayan, then power minister, had ignored the suggestion and given the job to Canadian firm Lavalin. Balanandans letter is expected to throw more light on the deal.        
	T.P. Nandakumar, editor of a local magazine, said today Balanandan had sent him key documents on the deal two years ago, through a contact. Some of the information is said to be part of the Citu leaders letter.        
	The papers had come in instalments, Nandakumar said, adding Balanandan must have leaked them because he was dismayed with the partys inaction on Vijayan.        
	Chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan said today the February 14-15 politburo meeting would discuss Balanandans letter and all matters related to the Lavalin deal.        
	Balanandan had been upset that Vijayan had cast aside his proposals that BHEL be given the job of revamping the three hydel plants at an estimated Rs 100 crore.         
	What might have rankled Balanandan more was the fact that Lavalin was given the contract, at a much higher estimated cost of Rs 374.5 crore, within 10 days of his report.         
	The CBI has accused Vijayan of showing undue haste and overlooking procedures as power minister.        
	The CBI report to Kerala High Court, which ordered the probe, says Vijayan put all the blame on senior government officials for the loss to the exchequer from the deal.        
	The report also claims Vijayan withheld crucial information from the Cabinet when the Lavalin deal came up for approval. The cabinet note is signed by the minister concerned (Vijayan), implying he took full responsibility.        
	Lavalin was to have brought in an aid of Rs 98 crore to set up the Malabar Cancer Centre, a state institute. But only a fraction of the money came, prompting allegations that all, or a part, of the remaining amount might have been misappropriated. Lavalins aid obligation wasnt mentioned in the contract, an omission the CBI report said was a faade for corruption.

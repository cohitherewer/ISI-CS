The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Party budget advice to Pranab
                                                                                                               Party budget advice to Pranab
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 15: Divestment is okay but do try and see if sick or loss-making PSUs can be saved by merging them with profit-making ones, the Congress advised Pranab Mukherjee today at a pre-budget meeting.        
	Explaining the principle, a party functionary said that ITI Limited and BSNL could compliment each other if merged. BSNL, he said, was earning huge profits. ITIs advantage, on the other hand, was that it had units with huge assets across the country.        
	A general secretary, who began his political career in party labour arm Intuc, had another suggestion: the money raised from divestment should be ploughed back into the same organisation.        
	A member from Karnataka grumbled that while IT and biotech industries were pampered with incentives, Mangalore Refineries and Petro- Chemicals, a PSU, had been neglected despite posting a Rs 42,000-crore turnover last year and bringing in more foreign exchange than the IT and BT companies put together.        
	The pro-PSU group invoked Sonia Gandhi to shore up their case for greater state protection, sources said.         
	When recession and job losses set in, the Congress president had reminded people how Indira Gandhis nationalisation programmes had equipped us to fight the crisis. If we have not gone the way of the West, it is thanks to our PSUs, a member said.        
	Mukherjee was also asked to ensure proper follow-up on the Rs 3-a-kg rice scheme (a poll promise) to ensure delivery to the right people.

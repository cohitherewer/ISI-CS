The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Land grab cloud on Oxford campus
                                                                                                               Land grab cloud on Oxford campus
                            
	London, Aug. 30 (PTI): Oxford Universitys plan to set up a campus in India has run into rough weather with human rights activists accusing the developers of resorting to land grab, media reports said today.         
	The Indian developers of a 12,500-acre site at Lavasa, about 200km from Mumbai, have been accused of intimidating farmers and forcing them to sell their land for very low prices, The Sunday Times said.        
	The lakeside land comprises about 20 villages, farms and forest land. An estimated 4,000-5,000 people have left the area, many allegedly under pressure, the report said.         
	Medha Patkar, who is leading the villagers campaign, described the takeover as land grab. She said people are threatened... made to feel like criminals. They cannot survive there unless they submit, so they sell their land for the prices offered.         
	The developers of Lavasa said allegations of fraud and coercion were fabricated, false and without basis, adding that most of the land had belonged to absentee landlords. It said it had provided housing for the displaced people.         
	Hindustan Construction Company, an infrastructure firm, denied allegations that it had forcibly acquired land for the Lavasa Hill City Project.        
	A company spokesperson said despite our repeated offers to engage in a productive dialogue with them (activists) to address the issues raised, they have not responded.         
	Oxford plans to offer courses for Indian executives in the education centre at Lavasa, a privately managed city modelled on hill stations built by the British Raj. The Girls Day Schools Trust, a private education chain, will establish a boarding school there.         
	Rajgopal Nogja, the president of Lavasa Corporation, said he hoped 5,000 students would enrol at the education centre, to be built at a cost of 15-20 million (Rs 120-160 crore), in its first five years.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Handgrab that can split Nitish amp; necessary evil
                                                                                                               Handgrab that can split Nitish amp; necessary evil
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                           Kumar: Nettled                                  
	New Delhi, May 18: The hand thats rocking the NDA following its electoral debacle is not, as widely suspected, Nitish Kumars. It belongs to his Gujarat counterpart Narendra Modi.         
	The Bihar chief minister is learnt to be deeply annoyed at the manner in which Modi grabbed his hand on the Ludhiana podium last week and held it aloft for a photograph that Modi took to his albums and Nitish to the nearest dustbin.         
	In the words of a close aide, Nitish dismounted the NDA dais seething at Modis opportunism and has now determined not to go to any meeting or occasion where the presence of the Gujarat chief minister is likely.         
	Nitish Kumar took a public stand against Narendra Modi campaigning in Bihar and that had a lot of political symbolism and content to it, said the aide. That photograph was not merely Modis bid to seek Nitishs endorsement, it was also an attempt to sabotage the social constituency we are trying to consolidate.         
	Modi may have come out smarter in Ludhiana but he has left Nitish smarting. Although nobody will state it on record, Nitish has conveyed his anger to the BJP leadership and his decision not to come may well have been the main reason why the scheduled NDA meeting today had to be scrapped.         
	Sources close to the Bihar chief minister are denying that Nitish has any immediate plans to sever ties with the BJP, but they arent ruling out the possibility of a rupture sooner rather than later.         
	Nitish, the sources indicated, is in no tearing hurry to jettison himself from the BJP and would prefer to choose his moment. While expressing his displeasure over the Modi trick in Ludhiana, he is believed to have reasoned with senior colleagues that the Janata Dal (United) should not dishonour the mandate which he got in alliance with the BJP.         
	Even so, the process of unshackling may have begun. The BJP has always been a necessary evil for Nitish Kumar, said a top Dal(U) leader in Delhi. We come from entirely different ideological streams and joined hands only to oust Lalu Prasad from power. The compulsions of the past are no longer so pressing.         
	Not only is Lalu Prasad not the formidable rival he once was, Nitish himself has cause for new confidence. His electoral graph has been on a steady high since the 1999 Lok Sabha polls and in the elections just ended, it registered a quantum jump  from a little over 18 per cent of the vote share to nearly 25 per cent.         
	In contrast, the BJPs vote share has risen by one point to 13 and Lalu Prasads has plummeted from nearly 32 per cent in 2000 to 19 per cent. It is not so much the number of seats Nitish has grabbed in the 15 th Lok Sabha  20 on his own, 32 in all with the BJP  that is bolstering the case for going it alone. It is his burgeoning vote share at the expense of Lalu Prasad, still the most formidable opposition in the state.         
	Even when he lost power in the state in November 2007, Lalu Prasad maintained his vice-grip over the Yadav-Muslim constituency, grabbing 65 seats and 24 per cent of the vote share. Nitish was able to tide that over only because he and the BJP added up to four per cent more. But in the two-odd years that he has been in power, Nitish has been able to twist caste equations substantively in his favour.         
	This he has done essentially by concentrating on appeasement of the extremely backward (read non-Yadav) caste groups, the lower end of Dalits and, most important, the backward, or Pasmanda, Muslims. It is a whole new configuration Nitish Kumar has brought into play and it is already paying him dividends, says Saibal Das of the Patna-based think-tank ADRI. To my mind, he has swung more than 20 per cent Muslims away from Lalu in this election and also got upper caste and middle class votes on account of good governance. All his political opponents should watch and be wary of the way he is going, including the BJP, he is getting an unbeatable set of social and development factors behind him. By championing the case for special status to Bihar, he is also very cleverly exploiting Bihari sub-nationalism, it may well pay.         
	Das wouldnt hazard a guess on Nitishs political course in the near/mid term, but he agreed that should the chief minister disengage from the BJP, he will become the immediate beneficiary of a cascade of Muslim support that has come to recognise him as a secular man but remains averse to his chosen partners.         
	A Dal(U) leader, quite apparently a votary of the ditch-the-BJP brigade, was more blunt about the direction his leader should head in. Nitishji has Bihar in his pocket, he has a base in rural and urban areas, he has immense goodwill and credibility as a man who wants to deliver, he is seen as a new hope, if he does not got it alone now, when will he? He should know, and probably does, that he is far ahead of anyone else, he just has to convert that into an electoral endorsement.         
	JD(U) leaders in Bihar, or Delhi, are still unsure when Nitish will think it is time to go it alone. But another hand-grab by Narendra Modi will surely firm his mind.

                                                                                                               Recce for Hasina trip
          JAYANTH JACOB                       Hasina                          
	New Delhi, Sept. 7: Bangladesh foreign minister Dipu Moni arrived here today on a visit that will prepare the ground for Prime Minister Sheikh Hasinas trip, her first since the February BDR mutiny, later this year.        
	Moni, the senior-most Bangladesh representative to visit Delhi since the UPA returned to power this May, will call on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and hold discussions with external affairs minister S.M. Krishna and finance minister Pranab Mukherjee during her four-day visit.        
	No agreements are to be signed but Monis talks will cover the entire range of bilateral issues.        
	This visit, the first high-level contact between the two countries after the UPAs return, will prepare the ground for the Bangladesh Prime Ministers visit later this year, a source said. Hasina took office this January.         
	Connectivity, trade and security issues are likely to dominate Monis talks here, external affairs ministry officials said.        
	The source said Delhi was ready to clarify any misgivings Dhaka had over the Tipaimukh hydroelectric project in Manipur. Opposition parties in Bangladesh have been railing against the project  near the confluence of the Barak and Tuivai rivers  saying it will reduce water flow to parts of that country.        
	In the talks with Moni, Delhi is likely to emphasise the need to jointly combat terror. It is also expected to urge Dhaka to deport insurgents like United Liberation Front of Assam (Ulfa) top gun Anup Chetia, said to be in Bangladesh.        
	This February, Mukherjee, who was external affairs minister in the previous UPA government, had visited Dhaka. India had then announced several unilateral initiatives like duty-free access to Bangladeshs garments and several other items, besides lifting of a ban on Indian FDI in the neighbouring country.               
	A bilateral trade treaty was signed, as was an agreement on protection of investments.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BSP holds edge in Round One
                                                                                                               BSP holds edge in Round One
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Mayavati: Big fight                                   
	Maharajganj (east Uttar Pradesh), April 15: The Bahujan Samaj Party appears to have an edge in the 16 seats that go to polls tomorrow in the first leg of the five-phase elections in Uttar Pradesh.         
	The Poorvanchal region, or the east, where all these seats are located, historically sets the trend in the state on voter turnout as well as voting pattern.        
	Mayavatis BSP is in the fight in all 16 constituencies. The Samajwadi Party, which swept the region in 2004 with 13 seats, is a contender in just nine constituencies.         
	Apart from its traditional strongholds Gorakhpur and Maharajganj, the BJP has crept into the fight in seven seats, suggesting that after two back-to-back routs in the last Lok Sabha and Assembly elections, it is on the road to recovery.        
	However, no party can afford to relax because the elections in Poorvanchal are expected to be fiercely fought and the margins are likely to be thin.        
	The BJPs limited comeback is not because of Hindutva or a combative party organisation. Rather, it is because of the following that individual candidates, such as Yogi Adityanath in Gorakhpur, command, skilful social engineering or the upper castes being upset with Mayavati.        
	In Maharajganj, the BJPs five-time MP, Pankaj Chowdhury, is up against a Brahmin candidate from the BSP. To fight anti-incumbency and a possible desertion of Brahmin voters, who have been voting for the BJP but could opt for the BSP this time since the candidate belongs to their caste, Chowdhury is trying to confuse Mayavatis Dalit and Muslim voters.        
	Through his own grassroots network and the RSS, Chowdhury has been quietly spreading the word that the Congress nominee, Harshavardhan, is formidable and has a lot of goodwill because of the Centres farmer-friendly schemes. His calculation is that if the Brahmins are taken in by the propaganda that the BSP could lose Dalit and Muslim support, they might not want to waste their votes on the partys candidate, Shankar Pandey.         
	Whether this will work is anybodys guess. B.N. Mishra, an advocate, said: We cannot ignore the fact that the Scheduled Castes are the biggest block and come what may, they will not be swayed by the BJP-RSS rumours. The young Dalits are full of beans because they want to see their Behenji as the next Prime Minister. They will sweat it out for hours on polling day which the other castes wont.        
	Mayavatis biggest asset is the solid base of 18 to 20 per cent Dalit voters in every constituency. Our job is to build a super-structure of the other caste and minority votes, said Triveni Yadav, a BSP activist from Brarahaganjan, a village 20km from Maharajganj.        
	No other party, not even the Samajwadi, has this advantage because in places such as Chandauli and Ballia  where Mayavati has fielded Yadav nominees  Mulayam Singh Yadavs caste voters are going with the BSP. Mayavatis other advantage is the presence of her cadres, specially trained in election management, everywhere. That it heads the state government, which has three years to go, also helps.        
	The Samajwadis are well placed in the three constituencies in the Allahabad region but likely to drop seats in the other pockets of Poorvanchal because of the emergence of the Ulema Council, a party that claims to champion the cause of Muslims.

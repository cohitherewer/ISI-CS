The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Slumdog cop stings ignorant nit-pickers 
                                                                                                               Slumdog cop stings ignorant nit-pickers 
          AMIT ROY                            Slumdog Millionaire actors Dev Patel and Freida Pinto (left) and Irrfan Khan at the Baftas on Sunday. (AFP)                                 
	London, Feb. 9: Irrfan Khan in a single withering sentence dismissed those in Bollywood and elsewhere who have sought to undermine Slumdog Millionaires Oscar chances by alleging that the film, which won seven Baftas last night, had exploited slum children in Mumbai and wallowed in the dark side of Indian life.        
	They are ignorant, said Irrfan, who plays a police inspector given the task of discovering just how it is that a boy from the slums with no formal education knows the answers to all the difficult questions demanded of him in a television quiz programme.        
	As he spoke to The Telegraph on the red carpet, he was joined by A.R. Rahman, who won a Bafta for his music last night, as well as Anil Kapoor, who took it upon himself to assume the title of Mr Bollywood.        
	It has to be said that the massed ranks of photographers did not really recognise any of them, allowing them to pass quietly on the red carpet while the arrival of Hollywood A-listers, notably Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie but also Meryl Streep and Sharon Stone and Spanish actress Penelope Cruz, raised excitement to fever pitch.        
	The only Indians to arouse any degree of frenzy were the young leads from Slumdog Millionaire, Dev Patel, the 18-year-old who had come with his mother and appeared to be having the time of his life, and his girlfriend in the film, Freida Pinto. Dev, Dev, Dev the cry went up as the tall, lanky lad was firmly advised his priority was to give interviews to television networks.        
	At one point, while Brad and Angelina worked one side of the red carpet, the Bollywood lot was on the other. It appeared to be Bollywood versus Hollywood.        
	The result was a little like the recently concluded India-Sri Lanka one-dayers.         
	Like Slumdog Millionaire, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button had 11 nominations but the Hollywood production picked up three relatively minor awards.        
	The Hollywood power couple Brad Pitt, who stars in Button, and Angelina Jolie, who was hoping to win best actress for Changeling, had to console themselves with a goodie bag featuring an aromatherapy massage at the Dorchester, The Times noted gleefully today.        
	There is no guarantee that the Americans will not correct the imbalance on February 22 in Los Angeles but the British now feel that the Bafta ceremony is no longer a poor cousin of the Oscars.        
	Writing in The Daily Telegraph, David Gritten, commentator on films, said: It may be time for us all to stop thinking of Britains Baftas primarily as a healthy alternative to Americas Oscars. Sunday nights ceremony at Londons Royal Opera House proved that the Baftas are currently by far the more interesting awards. In a display of good taste and independent judgement, the Baftas 6,000 voters  industry professionals every one  delivered some intriguing, heartening results.        
	He added: The nights big winner, Slumdog Millionaire, which won seven Baftas, may seem an obvious choice now, but until its British premiere in October at the London Film Festival, it looked an unlikely awards front-runner. Its continuing success is thoroughly deserved; especially pleasing is the return to the limelight of director Danny Boyle, who never stopped making well-crafted films, but without this degree of commercial success.

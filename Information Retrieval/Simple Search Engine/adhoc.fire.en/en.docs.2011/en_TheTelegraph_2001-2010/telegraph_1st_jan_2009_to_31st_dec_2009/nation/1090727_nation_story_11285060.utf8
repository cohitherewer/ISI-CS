The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Malaysia, the new lair of Ulfa insurgents
                                                                                                               Malaysia, the new lair of Ulfa insurgents
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Silchar, July 26: After Bangladesh and Bhutan, Malaysia could be the Ulfa top brasss next stop as they play the artful dodger.         
	The state director-general of police, G.M. Srivastava, who is set to retire this month-end, said the Ulfa leadership, including commander-in-chief, Paresh Barua, was currently finding that Bangladesh was no longer interested in providing them refuge.         
	Barua was now in southern China, Srivastava told The Telegraph.         
	He could be in Malaysia soon to explore the possibility for making it the new abode of the Ulfa top brass, the DGP said.         
	Srivastava said many in the rank and file of the outfit were now having second thoughts about continuing their violent war against the authorities in the state, but were not yet ready to throw in the towel because of pressure from the top leaders.         
	The DGP said two of Ulfa bosses, Barua and foreign secretary Sasha Choudhury, were reluctant to sit for peace talks with the Centre because of some agenda and vested interests.         
	He said while Barua was keen on maintaining the string of properties, including real estate and sea trawlers, which he had acquired in Bangladesh, Choudhury was tied to the apron strings of the ISI of Pakistan and hence could not become a peacenik.        
	Srivastava also claimed that Barua was now in a property-purchasing spree in Canada as he felt that he could no longer operate from Bangladesh.         
	Barua, he said, had already bought at least three flats in Canada, where he proposed to shift his wife and children. The police chief claimed that the frontline militant groups of the state have been somewhat tamed in the face of relentless pressure by the police.         
	He said Ulfa, the National Democratic Front of Boroland and Dima Halam Daogah (Jewel) had of late suffered reverses in their fight against the police and security forces.         
	While the DHD (J) received a major blow when its chief Jewel Gorlosa and deputy commander- in-chief Partha Warisa were arrested last month in Bangalore in a well executed operation by state police, the Ranjan Daimary faction of the National Democratic Front of Boroland lost around 50 cadres since March this year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | House panel frowns on IIT test declaration
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      House panel frowns on IIT test declaration
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 15: The IIT practice of forcing aspiring students to declare that they will accept decisions taken by the institutes top admissions agency does not make the selection process foolproof, a parliamentary panel has said.        
	The standing committee on human resource development has challenged the governments argument that a declaration students need to sign to appear for the IIT entrance test takes the test beyond scrutiny.        
	The committee strongly feels that the unequivocal declaration by the candidate in his admission form and his parent does not mean that the entire examination procedure is foolproof, the panel has said in a report tabled in Parliament.        
	The committee is inquiring into the 2006 Joint Entrance Examination in which the IITs used cut-offs they have been unable to date to explain to date.        
	The cut-offs used by the IITs in 2006 were significantly different from the levels the IITs should have used  given the determination procedure the IITs themselves disclosed.        
	The panels comments are significant because the IITs used the declaration to argue before Calcutta High Court that student complainants against the 2006 JEE should not be entertained.         
	A single-judge bench at the court had upheld the IIT argument but a two-judge bench is now hearing an appeal filed by an affected student.        
	The JEE application form requires aspirants to sign a declaration. I understand the decision of the joint admission board regarding my admission is final, and I shall abide by the decision, the declaration states.         
	Students have to sign the declaration  aimed at minimising post-test litigation  to receive their admit card for the entrance test.        
	But students who felt they suffered in 2006 because of the discrepancies in the JEE that year have questioned the legitimacy of a declaration that is voluntary only in name  not signing means the end of IIT aspirations.        
	The Parliament panel in its report has supported these concerns, criticising the human resource development ministry and the IITs for using the declaration to try and obfuscate the controversy surrounding the admissions in 2006. The panel is headed by senior Congress leader Oscar Fernandes, and Rahul Gandhi is a member.        
	Students have said they are not challenging the admission board  which decides on the procedure to be used in determining cut-offs  but are in fact questioning the implementation of its decision.

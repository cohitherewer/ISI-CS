The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | LS count in Sena vs Sena 
                                                                                                               LS count in Sena vs Sena 
										      CHARU SUDAN KASTURI       STATE ELECTIONS                              
	Thane, Oct. 12: Sixty-five year-old Devram Jambhulkar smiled as he looked up at the tall pole standing in the middle of a busy jewellery market in Kalyan.        
	A saffron Shiv Sena flag fluttered at the top, a Maharashtra Navnirman Sena flag hung a couple of feet below, and a Congress hoarding stood near the bottom of the pole.         
	If thats the order in which the parties finish here, Ill be happy, laughed the local Sena leader.        
	For that to happen, people will have had to learn from the Lok Sabha results, Jambhulkar added in a murmur.        
	Forty kilometres away, supporters of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) Thane (urban) candidate Rajan Raje cited the over one lakh votes he won as a Lok Sabha candidate from here earlier this year to highlight his victory prospects.         
	The performance in the Lok Sabha, the first time we contested, showed that the MNS is the party of the future in Maharashtra, Raje said at his home in the afternoon during a break in campaigning.        
	Armed with diametrically opposite arguments, both the Sena and the MNS are using this years Lok Sabha results as the subtext of their Assembly poll campaign to attract Marathi Manoos voters who are still undecided on which of the two parties to choose.        
	The MNS is using its large vote count in those elections to suggest that it represents the future leadership of the population segment that has traditionally supported the Sena.         
	The Sena, on the other hand, is silently citing the Lok Sabha polls during this campaign to suggest to voters that while Raj Thackeray can divide their votes, the MNS cant win elections.        
	By voting for the MNS, as some of them did in the Lok Sabha polls, their traditional support base is voting for a losing cause  splitting the Marathi vote and assisting the ruling Congress-Nationalist Congress Party team in winning, the Sena has been arguing.         
	The outcome of this unstructured debate being played out in bastis and high-rises alike could determine whether the Sena retains its dominance in the suburbs of Mumbai  critical to its chances of dethroning the current government in alliance with the BJP.         
	Mumbais suburbs in Thane district  with a predominantly Marathi population living in close proximity to migrants to the metropolis  have traditionally provided the ideal electorate for the Sena to prey on.         
	Playing on the perceived fear from the others  migrants and non-Hindus  the Sena has built itself a stronghold that offers returns even when other parts of the state may vote against it.        
	Thane hosts 24 Assembly constituencies  the most for any district in Maharashtra. The four constituencies within the municipal limits of Thane city are all at present held by the Sena.         
	But the Sena, which has also consistently held the Thane Lok Sabha seat, lost to the NCP in the general elections this year  by a margin smaller than the votes gobbled by the MNSs Raje. Today, the MNS considers Thane its strongest base.         
	Raje, a trade unionist who never associated with the Sena and joined Raj only after the formation of the MNS, is viewed by many as the strongest candidate of the new Sena.         
	Rajs unwavering stand in favour of Marathi locals  in contrast with the Senas dithering  was responsible for him joining the MNS, Raje claimed. And that is what will attract an increasing number of youth to the party, he said.         
	A break-up of the Lok Sabha voting patterns in the district Thane, Kalyan, Bhiwandi and Palghar Lok Sabha constituencies  over its Assembly segments suggests that a repeat may help the MNS win only a handful of seats.         
	But the break-up also suggests that while the MNS may only win a few seats, it could damage the Sena-BJP alliances prospects in each seat it is contesting.         
	Thats what we are silently spreading among our traditional voters. People, we hope, will see that the MNS has no chance of winning enough seats to represent the Marathi cause. So it makes little sense to support them and ruin chances of the party that can form the government, a top Bal Thackeray aide said late last evening.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bengal wary of army role in its territory
                                                                                                               Bengal wary of army role in its territory
  -CPM toes Centres line on talks 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee                                  
	Calcutta, Oct. 8: The Bengal CPM today echoed Union home minister P. Chidambaram by ruling out talks with Maoists until they shun violence. But the state government said it was in no hurry to invite the army to tackle the Maoists in Bengal.        
	Talks cant be held on top of dead bodies. Let them first stop killing people and extorting others. I dont know what the state government wants but it is our partys stand, CPM state secretariat and central committee member Shyamal Chakraborty said.         
	The state government has implemented the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) despite protests from allies and would continue to work in tandem with the home ministrys planned crackdown on the Maoists, expected after the Assembly polls on October 13.        
	CPM leaders said the state governments decision was not guided only by the synergy of interests with the Congress-led Centres planned crackdown against a common enemy.        
	However, the Left Front government will not invite army action against the rebels in Bengal now, fearing that such a step would reinforce the Trinamul Congresss demand for imposition of Presidents rule on the ground of failure to contain the Maoists.         
	We are in close interaction with the Centre and our belief is that they are quite satisfied with the manner in which the joint forces are working, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said.         
	We have asked for additional forces but the matter is still pending. As of now, we dont feel the need for army deployment in order to combat the Maoists. If the Centre decides to deploy the army, the state government will have to be consulted. If we dont agree, there will be no army presence.        
	The partys public support to the Centres anti-rebel operation with army and air force support in other states would depend on the outcome of the politburo meeting on October 11 as well as chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Chidambaram the next day.        
	The CPM is also happy with the Centres plan to extend Presidents rule in Jharkhand to facilitate the anti-Maoist operation, he added.         
	However, the CPMs partners have referred to the partys doublespeak on the UAPA.         
	Citing CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechurys editorial in the partys organ, Peoples Democracy, last year, they underscored the CPMs reservations on the hasty passage of the UAPA as he feared gross misuse of three clauses of the law.         
	Sitaram had opposed the extension of period of detention without bail from maximum 90 days to 180 days in the UAPA as well as the provision that puts the onus of proving innocence on the accused and a three-year prison term for providing false information. Today, the state government is trying to detain Chhatradhar Mahato and others for long using the same provisions, said an RSP leader.         
	Fresh remand blow        
	A West Midnapore court today granted police eight days custody of Sukhshanti Baskey, the treasurer of Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities. The police had sought remand for 21 days under the UAPA but, like in Mahatos case on Wednesday, the court scaled back the duration. The magistrate did not cite any reason.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | All work and no Twitter for Tharoor
                                                                                                               All work and no Twitter for Tharoor

	New Delhi, Sept. 22: Minister of state for external affairs Shashi Tharoor went on a high-gear but low-profile damage-control exercise with government and party bosses today in an effort to bury his troubles following his controversial cattle class-holy cows tweet last week.         
	At the end of the day-long VVIP calling that included meetings with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Congress president Sonia Gandhi and finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, in addition to phone conversations with defence minister A.K. Antony and Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi, the young minister was said to be heaving a sense of mission accomplished. Sources said he had put the infamous Twitter behind him and renewed vows on dedicating himself to the interests of the party and the government.        
	Tharoor is believed to have made the point to the Congress president that he thinks he is an asset to the party, and that he wants to do the job at hand to the best of his ability. In what was perhaps an indirect admission of indiscretions committed on Twitter, he said he did not want to get distracted by anything.         
	Sources argued that Tharoor had made personal sacrifices in order to work for the Congress and the government and that itself was indication of his seriousness of intent; lucrative lecture tour commitments were cited as illustration of such sacrifice.        
	The sources added that as part of his explanation to the leadership, Tharoor also conveyed to the Congress leadership that he was not consulted over his version of things before party spokespersons decided to go hammer and tongs against him in public.        
	The Twitter episode ended when the minister (Tharoor) was abroad, the moment he explained his position and said sorry, sources close to the minister said, adding: He has had a line of communication with the Prime Minister who eventually termed it a joke. But he wanted to explain the matter to the leadership as the entire controversy happened when he was abroad.         
	The sources also insisted that the main agenda of Tharoors meeting with the Prime Minister was his recent Africa visit, a region that Singh is keen on as a special focus area of the foreign policy.        
	Tharoor was in Ghana to participate in the birth centenary celebrations of the first President of Ghana Kwame Nkrumah, as a special representative of the Prime Minister.         
	But the message following a public reprimand from the party high command has probably gone home to Tharoor.         
	The Prime Minister may have eventually made light of his tweets but the party, and the government, did not take kind view of a minister lavishing his sense of humour on the Congresss austerity resolve.         
	Proof? Tharoor kept a deliberate low profile throughout his high-profile meetings today, ducking away from the media meeting after meeting. His bosses were probably happy to see a Tharoor living by the conduct they had counselled behind closed doors.

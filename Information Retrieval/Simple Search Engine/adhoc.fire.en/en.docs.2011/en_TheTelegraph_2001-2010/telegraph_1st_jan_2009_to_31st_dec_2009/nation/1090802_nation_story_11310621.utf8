The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lalgarh push amp; lawless shove
                                                                                                               Lalgarh push amp; lawless shove
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Aug. 1: Home minister P. Chidambaram today said he had urged Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to take steps so that we can redeploy the central paramilitary forces from Lalgarh and painted several districts in Bengal as lawless zones.        
	On Thursday, Chidambaram had said that many districts in the state resembled killing fields after a series of murders of political workers, provoking the ire of the Left.         
	I am sorry that Mr Chidambaram is probably not properly informed of the situation, Bengal CPM secretary Biman Bose had retorted.        
	But the home minister stood by his statement today. I did not point a finger of blame at anyone. At least not yet. All I said was that many districts in West Bengal have become killing fields, he said.         
	When he used that description, the home minister said, he had done so after receiving a letter from the Bengal chief minister, a representation from the Opposition Trinamul Congress. He also said he had reports from central intelligence agencies.        
	The phrase killing fields has been used in many contexts. But it gained currency after Roland Joffes 1984 film The Killing Fields based on New York Times journalist Sydney Schanbergs accounts of the Cambodian civil war (1975) when the forces of the Khmer Rouge overran Phnom Penh. An estimated two million people were reported killed in Pol Pots purges that followed.        
	CPM general secretary Prakash Karat, in Calcutta to attend a party state committee meeting, protested strongly against Chidambarams comments made on Thursday. Such sweeping statements were uncalled for, he said.        
	The CPM is expected to get back at the Union minister.        
	The home minister today repeated his observation that many districts in West Bengal have been killing fields and said that the information he had prompted him to say with a deep sense of regret and concern that killings have become a routine affair in West Bengal in clashes between political parties.        
	He said it was the responsibility of the Bengal government to ensure that killings do not take place. Political parties can be adversaries but killings must not take place, he said.        
	Chidambaram said it was seven weeks since the central forces had gone into Lalgarh but the situation there is still unstable.         
	Asked if he had informed the Bengal government if the central forces were to be withdrawn from Lalgarh, the home minister said: The central paramilitary forces cannot be deployed for an indefinite period, we have made it clear to all concerned but there was no roadmap for withdrawal now.        
	Bengal home secretary Ardhendu Sen said: We have requested the Centre to let the paramilitary stay in Lalgarh for three or four more months. Now it is up to them.        
	Armed forces act        
	The Centre has said it is working to amend the controversial Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) and exploring ways to limit its application to some areas.        
	We are looking at limiting the application of the AFSPA to some areas. That is the goal over a period of time. In consultation with the state government, we will have to take a look at that, Chidambaram said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Festival focus on Jackie 
                                                                                                               Festival focus on Jackie 
          CITHARA PAUL                           Jackie Chan: Centre of attraction                                  
	New Delhi, March 31: From Bergman to Jackie Chan, its a long way. But the India International Film festival seems to have travelled that far within a few years.         
	The Film Festival Directorate, which runs the International Film Festival of India (IFFI), has decided to make Jackie Chan the focus of its next festival this December.        
	The package is expected to feature seven films of the Kungfu master, including his latest, Shinjuku Incident.         
	The directorate has also decided to invite Chan as guest of honour to the event. S.M. Khan, who heads the directorate, is understood to have sent an official invitation asking him to grace the occasion.         
	Not everyone is excited, though. There are jarring voices within the directorate over the crass commercialisation of festival.         
	It used to be the likes of (Akira) Kurosawa, (Roberto) Rossellini and (Ingmar) Bergman. Now we are going to have a Jackie Chan. Just see how much our sensibility has come down, said an official in the directorate. The officials say the festival has lost its character because of what they call, rather colloquially, Bollywoodisation and Hollywoodisation.        
	A film festival is supposed to showcase the best of world cinema. Most of us dont think Jackie Chan fits the bill. Moreover, we dont need a festival to watch a Jackie Chan movie. You can watch it anytime anywhere, said the official.         
	The dissenters are planning to approach veteran filmmakers like Shyam Benegal and Adoor Gopalakrishnan to step in to protect the character of the festival. We plan to involve the maestros in this (effort) so that the issue is highlighted, said the official.        
	However, those in favour of having Chan point out that he has been invited to similar prestigious events elsewhere, including the recent Hong Kong International Film Festival. If Shah Rukh can be the guest of honour, why not Jackie Chan? asked one of them.        
	Hollywoods John Landis, French actor Catherine Deneuve, and Iranian filmmaker and actress Niki Karima were invited to last years film festival. Shah Rukh was the guest of honour.         
	There is also a move within the directorate against Goa being the permanent venue of the festival. Ever since Goa was chosen the fixed venue, the very character of the film festival has gone. Now it is nothing more than a carnival. Having beautiful beaches should not be the sole criteria for selecting a venue. What is more important is whether the place has a film culture.         
	Places like Delhi, Calcutta and Thiruvananthapuram would have been a better choice, the official said.         
	The Centre picked Goa in 2004. Till then, the festival had been travelling between New Delhi and state capitals.         
	The officials now plan to submit a memorandum to the information and broadcasting ministry to revert to the old system.        
	The directorate has started calling for entries for international competition at this years festival.

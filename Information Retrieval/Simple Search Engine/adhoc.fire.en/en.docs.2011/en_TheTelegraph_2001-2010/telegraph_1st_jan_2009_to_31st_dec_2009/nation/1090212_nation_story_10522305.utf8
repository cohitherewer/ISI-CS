                                                                                                               Marshals vs MLAs in Andhra House
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, Feb. 11: Microphones were wrenched out, papers torn and flung in the air as men in khadi rained blows on safari-clad security staff in the Andhra Pradesh Assembly today.        
	The trigger was the suspension of 34 members of the Oppositions grand alliance  which includes the Telugu Desam, TRS, CPI and the CPM. The suspended MLAs refused to leave and marshals were called in to evict them.        
	Speaker K.R. Suresh Reddy had suspended the MLAs after failing to bring order even after adjourning the House thrice.         
	As chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy walked in at the same time as the marshals, the drama kicked off. The Desam and TRS members wrestled with the marshals, raining blows on them.         
	Harishwar Reddy and Srinivas Yadav of the Desam and Harish Rao of the TRS wrenched mikes out. Holding a mike threateningly, Reddy moved towards the marshals and tried to assault them.        
	The Speaker adjourned the House. When the marshals continued with the eviction, the MLAs beat them up. Leaders Chandrababu Naidu (Desam), Chada Venkat Reddy (CPI), N. Narasimaiah (CPM) and E. Rajender (TRS) watched. Chief marshal Gajapathi Raju was among those attacked.         
	The pandemonium continued for an hour. Calm returned when the chief marshal came back with full force and resumed the eviction. While some MLAs walked out, a few had to be carried out.         
	The last time such chaos was seen in the Assembly was in 1984 when then Desam chief N.T. Rama Rao was dethroned by his finance minister.

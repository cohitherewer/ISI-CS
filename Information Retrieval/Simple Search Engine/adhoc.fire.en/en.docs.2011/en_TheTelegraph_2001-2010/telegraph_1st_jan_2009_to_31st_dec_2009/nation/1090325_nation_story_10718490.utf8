The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Quota hint upsets industry
                                                                                                               Quota hint upsets industry
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 24: The Congress manifesto unveiled today got mixed reactions from industry which welcomed the promises on social and health security but was unhappy with the promise of affirmative action for weaker sections in the private sector.        
	I dont agree with any theory on job reservation. We need to make people more capable before making promises which could simply be counter-productive, if we as a nation want to be globally competitive, Renu Sud Karnad, joint managing director of HDFC, said.        
	Industry chambers shared her sentiments. They said they would oppose any move to bring legislation for this purpose. We welcome the majority of declarations made by the Congress in its manifesto but hope political parties will desist from bringing in legislation to impose reservation on industry, said D.S. Rawat, secretary general, Assocham.        
	The Congress said in its manifesto that it was deeply committed to pursue affirmative action for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the private sector and that a national debate had already been initiated on the matter.         
	It also pledged to carve out reservation for the economically weaker sections of all communities without prejudice to existing reservations for the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and the Other Backward Classes.        
	But Assochams Rawat said: The chamber is totally opposed to accepting reservation in the private sector through mandatory legislation and urges political parties not to make such promises to the electorate as these will prove detrimental to inclusive growth.         
	Promising populist steps like affirmative action in the private sector and a right to food act, The Congress today said its economic policy would focus on inclusive growth, the middle path and low inflation if voted back to power.        
	The industry also expressed doubts about the Congresss promise to give every family living below poverty line 25kg of rice or wheat every month at Rs 3 a kg.         
	Implementation is the key question. For example, who will ensure whether the rice and wheat promised will actually reach the right people. Also, is there any certainty on the quality. Many promises have been made in the past and not kept, said Karnad.        
	We need to have an honest system in place and accountability, she said.         
	In the manifesto, the Congress also promised to revive economy and restore high growth.         
	The industry, though, demanded GDP growth in the region of 9 to 9.5 per cent.        
	 In the long term, if India wishes to give large employment then we need to grow between 9-9.5 per cent. Unless people get jobs, we will not be able to get rid of poverty also this needs a great deal of focus on the infrastructure sector, said R.C. Bhargav, chairman of Maruti Suzuki India.         
	The Congress said it would follow the middle path, balancing between globalisation and indigenous development and the needs of urban and rural India, which the industry welcomed.regulation and entrepreneurship and organised and unorganised sector, and new and traditional industries.        
	We welcome the middle path and inclusive growth approach by the Congress but still implementation remains our key concern, said Harshpati Singhania, president, Ficci.

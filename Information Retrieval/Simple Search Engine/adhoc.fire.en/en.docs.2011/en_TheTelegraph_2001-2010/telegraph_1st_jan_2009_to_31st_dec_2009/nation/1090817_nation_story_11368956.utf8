The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PM sounds a war on waiting cases 
                                                                                                               PM sounds a war on waiting cases 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 16: The Prime Minister today declared a war against pending court cases, saying the world was surprised and India concerned that the country had the largest such pile-up globally.        
	In this war, a holistic and multi-pronged approach is vital. There is no space for piecemeal, patchy or sectoral responses, Manmohan Singh told a joint conference of chief justices and chief ministers.        
	A possible solution discussed at the meeting was to reduce the number of high court holidays or increase their working hours. Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan requested the high court chief justices to increase their working days from 210 to 220 a year or stretch the working time by half-an-hour.        
	Official figures showed 2.64 crore cases were pending in subordinate courts in 2008. The figure was 38.7 lakh for the 21 high courts. The Supreme Court had 52,592 cases pending at the end of June this year.        
	The states offered to do their bit by reaffirming their commitment to implement the Gram Nyayalaya Act. This law will pave the way for 5,000 courts at the panchayat level to dispose of cases quickly.        
	Singh said the government would match every step the judiciary took with two steps. A national conference of jurists and other stakeholders will be held in Delhi soon to set the stage for judicial reforms, the Prime Minister said.         
	Singh said the deliberations should be centred on the single-most important part in the system the consumer of justice, that is the people waiting for justice.        
	Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, not present, said through a written speech that the desire for justice was the cry of all societies, be it capitalist or socialist. He endorsed the Gram Nyayalaya concept, saying his state was actively considering phase-wise implementation of the programme.        
	But Bhattacharjee also pointed to problems in reducing the backlog in Bengal. It is not possible to set up morning and evening courts, an old suggestion, without the support of the Bar Council in Bengal, which has strongly opposed such a proposal.        
	Kerala, another communist-ruled state, also endorsed the idea of Gram Nyayalayas but found central funding to set up the courts inadequate. Law minister Veerappa Moily held out hope that the concept would soon take shape since 90 per cent of the states had agreed.        
	The chief justice also suggested ways to reduce the number of undertrials jailed for petty crimes. He said chief judicial magistrates and magistrates may coordinate with jail authorities and even visit prisons to dispose of petty crime cases with six-month jail terms. I told chief ministers also. It (the idea) may have some salutary effect, Balakrishnan said after the meeting.        
	The Chief Justice of Indias suggestion followed the Prime Ministers observation that many undertrials had been in jail for periods longer than they would have served had they been sentenced. This is, indeed, very disturbing.        
	Another problem is the delay in recruitment, which has meant that almost 3,000 posts of judges in the country are now lying vacant. The government will also establish 71 additional CBI courts, Singh said.

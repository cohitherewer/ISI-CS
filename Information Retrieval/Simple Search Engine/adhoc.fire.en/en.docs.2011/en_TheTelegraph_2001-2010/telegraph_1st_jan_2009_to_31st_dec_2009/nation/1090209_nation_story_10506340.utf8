The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Modi potshots wake up drowsy dozens
                                                                                                               Modi potshots wake up drowsy dozens
          SANJAY K. JHA                          Narendra Modi pays homage to RSS founder KB Hedgewar at the BJP national council in Nagpur. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 8: The BJP delegates were looking tired and drowsy when Narendra Modi took the microphone.        
	A few broadsides at the Dilli ki toli, Congress ke dhol bajanewale, sultanat ke chele-chapate (Delhis coterie, Congress drum-beaters and government stooges), and the party national council burst into applause. As if injected with a magic drug, the three-day convention had suddenly sprung to life at its fag end.        
	Modi was speaking on the political resolution, which does not promise a Ram temple in Ayodhya, pledged by party president Rajnath Singh yesterday.        
	The audience, which had repeatedly ignored earlier appeals from the dais to clap, cheered as Modi ripped into dynastic politics, discovered a new youthfulness in his party, and invoked Barack Obama to explain why the BJP should win the election.        
	If the mood underscored Modis pre-eminence and popularity in the party, the Gujarat chief minister went out of his way to provide the BJPs candidate for Prime Minister, L.K. Advani, with a new weapon against detractors.        
	Modi rebutted the old-versus-young logic that seeks to put Advani at a disadvantage  but with an argument that appeared to highlight the chief ministers own relative youth.        
	Modi claimed Advani had a younger team than the Congress and asked for a comparison between the average age of BJP and Congress chief ministers and between the average age of each partys legislators across the country.        
	BJP chief ministers were on the whole definitely younger than their Congress counterparts, he insisted, adding that the party had blundered by failing to project this aspect of its collective leadership.        
	The Congress, he alleged, was talking of youth only to establish the leadership of one young man from a certain family that had ruled the country for decades. He then claimed that even Americans were feeling suffocated by family rule  of the Bushes and Clintons  and so had voted for Obama.        
	Sushma Swaraj expanded on the theme, saying every young Congress leader was a product of dynastic politics whereas the public hadnt even heard about the families of Rajnath Singh, Arun Jaitley or Venkaiah Naidu.        
	Arun Jaitley, who presented the political resolution, described the past four years as a wasted opportunity. He said people with little political clout, including Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, had been chosen for important jobs to ensure that the real power remained in the hands of one family.        
	The resolution mentioned Muslim appeasement, Amarnath, Ram setu and the government affidavit questioning Rams existence. It spoke of economic mismanagement, terrorism, the governments failure to act strongly enough after the Mumbai attacks, vote-bank politics and the derailment of development projects initiated by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government.

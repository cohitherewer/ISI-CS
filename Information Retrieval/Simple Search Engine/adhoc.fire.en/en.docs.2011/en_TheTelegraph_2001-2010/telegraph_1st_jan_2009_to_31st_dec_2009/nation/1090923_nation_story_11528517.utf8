The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Puja pollution threatens fish
                                                                                                               Puja pollution threatens fish
  - River mission blames govt          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Cuttack, Sept. 22: While mandap hopping in Cuttack, beware of the gods and goddesses glossy finish.        
	The shine derived from chrome and lead-based paints threatens the very survival of aquatic creatures and increases pollution in the already contaminated Mahanadi and Kathajodi.        
	The government, environmental activists rue, has failed to regulate immersion of idols, containing hazardous paints or plaster of Paris  another hazardous substance  into the two rivers.        
	The administration has already granted permission to 154 traditional mandaps (that use chrome and lead-based paints) and has fixed September 29 as the date for immersion, both into the Kathajodi and the Mahanadi.        
	Biswajit Mohanty, the secretary of Wildlife Society of Orissa (WSO), leading a movement to keep the rivers clean, would like to blame the government more than Puja committees. Till date, the government has not initiated any ban on the use of chrome and lead-based paints, he said.        
	Central Pollution Control Board of the Union government acting on a WSO complaint six years ago had directed the board to frame guidelines to control pollution caused by immersion of idols.        
	But the Orissa State Pollution Control Board is yet to wake up, Mohanty told The Telegraph today.        
	During the festive season, beginning from Ganesh Puja in September and ending with Saraswati Puja in February, an estimated 3,000 smaller idols and 300 large community Puja goddesses are immersed in the Mahanadi and the Kathajodi.        
	A few committees, such as Balu Bazaar Puja Committee, claim that their idols are free of chemical paints. But, the WSO secretary has his doubts. Such a claim needs to be verified by expert bodies as organic paint is not easily available here and is expensive, Mohanty said.        
	Plaster of Paris is an insoluble powder that contaminates water by forming an impermeable layer on the bed. Till some years ago, idols were painted with dye, an eco-friendly substance extracted from stones, vegetables, seeds, fruits, seashells and clay, which dissolved in water easily.        
	Cheap inorganic paint categorised as hazardous gradually replaced them due to problems of availability and cost. Plaster of Paris is also being increasingly used, since it is stronger and dries faster.

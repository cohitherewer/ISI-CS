The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP cites three mistakes 
                                                                                                               BJP cites three mistakes 
          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, May 5: The BJP thinks Rahul Gandhi is not bright and is being misled by JNU-type intellectuals.        
	A top BJP leader denied that Rahul had shown sharper political acumen than before at his media conference today. Rahul came out as an untrained person with no comprehension of national realities, he said. The environment of sycophancy in the media is responsible for his stardom.        
	BJP strategist Arun Jaitley expressed similar sentiments in more sober language in his official briefing.        
	Without naming Rahul, he said: The analysis given by the Congress today lacks political maturity and carries three fundamental mistakes. These are: lack of political ethics, wrong on electoral chemistry and wrong on arithmetic.        
	He said the Congresss betrayal of the Left was unethical; its dumping of allies like the RJD and the Samajwadi Party stemmed from a misreading of the electoral chemistry and its hopes of emerging the largest single party resulted from wrong calculations.        
	Jaitley wouldnt directly refer to Rahuls news conference today but said his praise of Nitish Kumar would help the BJP-Janata Dal (U) in Bihar.

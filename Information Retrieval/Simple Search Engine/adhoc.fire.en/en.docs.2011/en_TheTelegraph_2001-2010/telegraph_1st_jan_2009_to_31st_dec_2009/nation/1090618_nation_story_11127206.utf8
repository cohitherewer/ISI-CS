	June 17 (PTI): Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said L.K. Advani had called him up to express regret for his utterances during the elections and that he had reciprocated the hurt BJP leaders gesture by apologising too.        
	The Prime Minster also said that Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari sought some time to tackle terrorism because of difficulties.        
	Singh said he had wished the BJP well as he wanted to put the recriminations behind him.        
	I was compelled to reply to him (Advani). I did say something which Mr Advani said hurt him, Singh said, speaking to journalists on his way home after a three-day visit to Yekaterinburg, Russia, where he attended two multilateral summits.        
	When he (Advani) rang up on May 16 to congratulate on the election results, he expressed regret. I also conveyed my apologies if I had hurt him, the Prime Minister added, asked if the bitterness of the poll campaign had been forgotten and whether he had forgiven the BJP leader.        
	Before the results that ensured the return of the Congress, Advani had called Singh a weak leader, prompting the Prime Minister to hit back saying the BJPs Iron Man had melted during the Kandahar hijack. He also suggested that Advani was weeping in a corner when the Babri Masjid was destroyed by hoodlums.        
	The next morning, the two leaders had a brief icy encounter in Parliament House where they shook hands but did not speak. The same evening, Advani skipped a dinner Singh hosted.        
	Today, Singh said he was looking ahead to close relations with the leader of the Opposition, taking forward the underlying sense of unity and a new beginning that he had spoken about while wrapping up the motion of thanks to the Presidents address earlier this month.        
	Asked about problems in the BJP after its election debacle, Singh said he was not in favour of gloating over difficulties of other political parties. I wish them well, he added.                  Manmohan Singhs wife Gursharan Kaur and daughter Upinder (extreme right) meet the head of the church at Ipatiev House, a memorial to Russias last czar Nicholas II, in Yekaterinburg on Tuesday. (PTI)       
	On relations with Pakistan, Singh, who had talked tough yesterday, said he favoured peace but made it clear the neighbour should take strong and effective action to stop terrorist attacks against India from its soil.        
	I have spoken before also about my vision of a co-operative subcontinent and of the vital interest that India and the people of the subcontinent have in peace. For this, we must try again to make peace with Pakistan, he said. But for this, it is essential that strong and effective steps are taken by Pakistan against the enemies of peace.        
	Singh, who met Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari in Yekaterinburg, said if Islamabad showed courage, determination and statesmanship to take the high road to peace, India will meet it more than half the way, repeating an offer he had made last week in Parliament.        
	Singh said Zardari talked about difficulties that his government was facing in fighting terrorism. I explained to him that whereas Pakistan has taken strong and effective action against Taliban and al Qaida, we have a strong feeling that those elements who are responsible for attacks in our country are not being brought to justice, Singh said.        
	We wish Pakistan well in dealing with Taliban but I would like Pakistan to show the same determination in dealing with elements who operate from Pakistani soil and commit acts of terrorism against India, the Prime Minister said.         
	On Kashmir, Singh said he was ready to talk with any group, including those not part of the political mainstream, an apparent reference to the separatist Hurriyat Conference.        
	I have not given up hope on Jammu and Kashmir, he said. We would be happy to engage in dialogue with any group which is interested in talking. That option remains. We will welcome even those who are not in the political mainstream. If they have any views, they are welcome to give (them).         
	Responding to a question on the rape of two women, allegedly by security forces, in Shopian, south Kashmir, the Prime Minister said his government was committed to zero tolerance to rights violations.

          SANJAY K. JHA                                          Caption      
	New Delhi, Dec. 24: The Congress leadership appears to have made up its mind not to support Shibu Soren as chief minister of Jharkhand.         
	Party president Sonia Gandhi is averse to the idea of offering to the state the same discredited leadership it had suffered since it came into being, a Congress leader said.         
	We dont see Soren getting the reins of Jharkhand again with our support, the Congress leader told The Telegraph, suggesting that the partys first choice remained former chief minister Babulal Marandi.         
	Asked about the possibility of Soren drifting towards the BJP, the Congress leader said: We are ready to take that risk as the chances of a stable government without Congress-JVM (Marandis party) participation are slim. We are convinced the state needs a chief minister who can provide effective administration.         
	Soren has so far given no hints of his readiness to work out a compromise, though he threatened today to approach the BJP, which said nobody is untouchable. But Congress leaders said they were prepared for a war of nerves.         
	All Congress MLAs, along with Marandi and his legislators, will arrive in Delhi tomorrow to discuss the action plan. Although a decision is unlikely tomorrow because of Christmas and unfinished negotiations with other players and Independents, the party is expected to firm up its plan to project Marandi as the next chief minister.        
	Congress leaders said they would be more than willing to help Sorens son, Hemant Soren, build his political career and the post of deputy chief minister could be offered to him.         
	Sources said the JMM boss could be accommodated in a Raj Bhavan if he agreed to accept Marandi as chief minister.        
	Congress sources also claimed that the party was in a position to sew up a simple majority without an understanding with the JMM. Many leaders are confident of passing the trial of strength, pinning hopes on others and the Indpendents who total 13. The Congress and its allies have 30 seats in the 81-member House.         
	But the party high command does not want to depend on the RJD prop as it will affect its politics in Bihar. Lalu Yadav, however, is expected to call on Sonia tomorrow to offer unconditional support.        
	A section of Congress leaders is also opposed to JMMs leadership because of its approach towards the Naxalites. They feel it would be extremely difficult for the Centre to pursue its anti-Maoist policy in Jhakhand under Sorens leadership, especially when he gave tickets to many former rebels.        
	A perception also exists that the JMM won more seats than expected because of Naxalite support. In contrast, Marandi is on the same page with home minister P. Chidambaram on the Maoist menace.        
	In case the Congress fails to make Marandi chief minister, the party may pressure Soren to name somebody else as chief minister, knowing that he cannot back anybody in his party other than his son who lacks administrative experience. The Congress will then try to persuade Soren to let his son go through a period of apprenticeship, a leader said.

	Srinagar, March 18: Police have arrested a female Lashkar-e-Toiba operative in Jammus Doda district.         
	The police laid a trap on Tuesday and arrested Suriya Begum, 35, from Thatri grid station.         
	Doda police chief Prabhat Singh said Suriya was an overground worker for the militant group.         
	She used to provide logistics support to militants like arranging money, SIM cards and other material, though she was not actively associated with militancy, Singh said.        
	Police sources said five SIM cards and some cash were seized from her possession.         
	A police officer said Suriya had been under the scanner for quite sometime.         
	There are around 250 overground militants in the district and some of them are women, he said.         
	The special superintendent of police, Doda, said Suriya was being interrogated. She is being brought from Thatri to Doda for further questioning, he said.

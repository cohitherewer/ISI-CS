The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Congress claws out for Third Front 
                                                                                                               Congress claws out for Third Front 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mukherjee at the Congress office in Delhi. (Prem Singh)                                  
	New Delhi, March 14: The Congress today questioned the raison dtre of the Third Front but tangentially admitted it was becoming a close challenger to the party after the BJP-led NDA.        
	It also likened the coalition of regional parties to the Holy Roman Empire of the seventeenth century, which, it claimed, was neither holy nor Roman nor even an empire.        
	That the Grand Old Party had not only acknowledged the fronts presence but was also rattled by it was apparent from the Congresss first structured response to the formation two days after its formal launch in Tumkur.        
	Pranab Mukherjee, one of the Congresss principal political strategists and trouble-shooters, was fielded to brief the media.        
	From the word go, it was clear Mukherjees brief was to criticise the front but without losing sight of the fact that the BJP was the only other national pole and its agenda of communalism, sectarianism and obscurantism remained a threat.        
	Asked who the Congresss main adversary was, he replied: Both are adversaries. But our principal adversary is the NDA, of course, because they ran a government for five years. Most of the Third Front parties are ideologically opposed to the NDA.        
	The main planks on which the foreign minister took on the Left-led front were:        
	a) the absence of an issue or programme that cemented its parties;        
	b) its impatience to project a Prime Minister candidate before finding out if its constituents were contesting enough seats to enable it to touch the halfway mark in the Lok Sabha;        
	c) the instability inherent in a coalition of politically disparate entities.        
	Mukherjee implied that a coalitions durability could be guaranteed only if it was spearheaded by the BJP or the Congress.         
	Only the electoral numbers will decide who can lead the government before the President calls the party or the alliance, he said.        
	Nowadays, we have a phrase called the Third Front. I dont know what is meant by a Third Front. I can understand that a conglomeration of political parties fighting the elections can come together.         
	But in the fronts case, he asked, for what did they come together?        
	The stated objective is a non-Congress, non-BJP government. Has it ever been possible? So what is the objective situation now to claim that it will stand? Of course, the electorate will say the last word. They must have an issue, a programme. We dont know what their common programme is. The only programme is to have someone as the Prime Minister. Isnt that placing the cart before the horse?        
	Mukherjee said there was nothing wrong in projecting an individual as the Prime Minister candidate.         
	But it must be backed by the fact that they (the front) are going to contest a large number of seats to get a majority, to reach the halfway mark. Otherwise, how can their candidate become the PM?        
	He brushed aside queries on whether the Congress might consider backing the front after the polls, but implied it was not inclined to propping up such arrangements for too long.        
	At the time of elections, different outfits emerge but they evaporate fast. If you have to perpetually depend on a crutch you cannot stand for long.        
	He said the Congress was not happy about relying on such crutches. We went into coalitions not out of choice but because of the compulsions of the situation.        
	Mukherjee would not concede that in Bengal, the Congress had ceded space to regional parties such as the Trinamul Congress. The Congress has not vacated the space. That space has been created for the Trinamul by the electorate.

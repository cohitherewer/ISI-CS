          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, March 13: India today handed Pakistan the answers to its 30 questions on the Mumbai attack, saying they provided enough material for Islamabad to take the probe forward and punish the guilty.        
	But as it handed over the 401-page answer sheet  foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon passing it on to Pakistan high commissioner Shahid Malik  India asked Pakistan six counter questions.        
	Referring to Pakistans claims about arresting six people, Delhi has asked for details of all the arrests, the suspects interrogation reports, and information about their bank accounts and accomplices.        
	Along with the answer sheet, India has sent video and audio CDs that form hard evidence, home ministry sources said. Delhi also sent a rebuttal of allegations that a Surat diamond merchant was involved in the Mumbai attack, along with some Pakistani Hindus.        
	The unimportant-looking black plastic bag that home minister P. Chidambaram handed over to foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee (before it was sent to Menon) contained the six-page main reply and 21 appendices, all trying to establish a Pakistani link to 26/11.        
	It answers every question. (The) answers have been supported by documentary evidence, Chidambaram said. There is enough material to take the investigation forward.        
	The bulky dossier, however, did not contain one piece of evidence that Islamabad had particularly sought  a copy of the confessional statement made to Mumbai police by the lone surviving gunman, Ajmal Kasab.        
	What it contained were DNA samples of all the 10 terrorists, their colour photographs, Kasabs fingerprints, and his DNA report matched with a toothbrush found on the hijacked boat, MV Kuber.        
	It also had a photograph of prime suspect and Lashkar-e-Toiba operations chief Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, identified by Kasab. Lakhvi is one of the six suspects said to be under arrest in Pakistan.        
	The black bag contained transcripts of all the purported conversations between the Mumbai gunmen and their handlers in Pakistan, as well as details of how Indian investigators had tapped the conversations and traced the calls to Pakistan.        
	The dossier mentions an address in Pakistan from where the Nokia phones found on the gunmen were allegedly bought. The address is Clifton Road in Karachi, a defence enclave where Dawood Ibrahim once used to live, sources said.        
	The rest of the evidence includes ballistic reports on the guns and ammunition used, and forensic reports on clues found on the boat.         
	Pakistan had sent the 30 questions  and two supplementary ones as well  in response to the Indian dossier of January 5, which, Islamabad said, lacked sufficient material.         
	If Pakistan is serious about investigating the horrific crimes committed in Mumbai, the answers provide a solid basis, Chidambaram said. He added that Islamabad should catch all those behind the carnage and either hand them over to India, or try and punish them in Pakistan.

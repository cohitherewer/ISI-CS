                                                                                                               When, Venky? Nobel answers now     Baroda friends recall how he wanted his research to help humanity
          BASANT RAWAT                                                              
	Ahmedabad, Oct. 7: Venkatraman Ramakrishnan won the Nobel today, but for his old friends in Baroda, the honour had been long overdue.        
	Our Venky has got the Nobel prize! exclaimed J.S. Bandukwala, a friend of the scientist. It is a huge news, a great honour.         
	Bandukwala, who taught physics at the Maharaj Sayajirao University of Baroda  of which the Nobel laureate is an alumnus  said it was only a matter of when, and not if, the award would come Venkys way.         
	For the last five years, Bandukwala said, I have been hearing about his nomination for the coveted prize. Im very happy. At last he has got the much-deserved recognition, which is indeed a great honour for the country.        
	The winner of this years chemistry prize  shared with two others  has his academic roots in the Gujarat city, where he grew up and did his graduation from.        
	Ramakrishnan was born in the temple town of Chidambaram in Tamil Nadu in 1952. When he was two, his parents moved to Gujarat.         
	Both his parents, father C.V. Ramakrishnan and mother Rajalakshmi, were scientists and taught biochemistry at the Maharaj Sayajirao University until they retired in the eighties. The elder Ramakrishnan, now 85, lives in Seattle, where daughter Lalita  also a scientist  teaches. Rajalakshmi, who did pioneering work on developing child nutrition in India, passed away two years ago.                       Ramakrishnan at the Medical Research Council Laboratory in Cambridge, England, on Wednesday. (AP)            Ada E Yonath, who shared the Chemistry nobel with Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas A Steitz was born in Jerusalem in 1939. She is the first Israeli woman to have got the Nobel Prize. Yonath is the fourth woman to win the Chemistry 
  Nobel and the first since 1964. ldquo;But I don rsquo;t know what that means mdash; does it mean that I rsquo;m the best woman since then? I don rsquo;t think that gender played a role here, rdquo; she said.            Thomas A Steitz was born in 1940 in Wisconsin, US. A Sterling Professor of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry at Yale University, his structural work on the ribosome and other enzymes involved 
  in DNA replication, translation and transcription, have provided insight into the pathways involved in information transfer and genome stability in the cell.      
	It was natural that their children would follow in their footsteps. While Venky chose physics and later biochemistry, younger sister Lalita opted for medicine and is now a senior faculty member at the University of Washington in Seattle. After completing her MBBS from Baroda, Lalita did her PhD in immunology from Tufts University in Boston and followed it up with a post-doctoral from Stanford University.        
	Although he got the Nobel for work on biochemistry, Ramakrishnan studied physics at the MS University of Baroda, graduating at the top of his class in 1971.        
	Bandukwala remembers Venky not just as a scientist and a brilliant student, but as a multi-dimensional personality. He is a music lover and an extremely kind-hearted secular person who cares for people, he said. We are in regular touch over email and Venky has been very concerned about his old servant in Baroda. He has not forgotten his roots, though he has not visited Baroda for many years now.        
	After his graduation, Ramakrishnan moved to the US for higher studies, and completed his PhD in physics from Ohio University in 1976. Back in the seventies, the US was a natural destination for a budding scientist of his calibre, said Bandukwala.         
	Old-timers in Baroda recalled that even while pursuing physics, Ramakrishnan was clear that he wanted to research on something that would help humanity.         
	His monumental work on how the DNA code is translated into life has done just that, helping fight infectious disease and develop new antibiotics.        
	Professor proud        
	Professor M.S. Govindarajan, who taught Venkatraman Ramakrishnan physics at Annamalai University, today said he was extremely happy to hear that my student has won the Nobel prize for chemistry.        
	I am proud of him, Govindarajan told PTI.

          ANANYA SENGUPTA                          Kumar, the kids father                                  
	New Delhi, March 25: A poverty-stricken father of five took two of his daughters out for a stroll and then tossed them into a canal. He couldnt feed them any longer.        
	One girl was saved; the other didnt make it.         
	The heart-wrenching act came on a day the countrys ruling party promised a law to ensure food security for the most vulnerable if voted back to power.         
	Vinod Kumar, a scrap dealer, stayed with his wife and three daughters in a rented room in Ghaziabad and travelled 25km every day to the capital for work. His other two daughters stay in their village in Meerut.        
	Around 8 last evening, Kumar took Monica, 10, and Manisha, 5, out on the pretext of a stroll and led them towards a bridge nearby. The 55-year-old first tossed Monica into the canal below. Then he flung Manisha in.         
	A passer-by alerted officials of a nearby police station. A constable saved Manisha, but Monica was washed away.        
	Kumar, who had been taking home less than Rs 50 a day, has been arrested. He had hoped with his job in Delhi, his earnings would grow. But the last few days he hadnt even been able to provide his family two meals a day, SP (rural) Kamal Asthana said.        
	Yesterday, the Congress poll manifesto promised a monthly ration of 25kg of grain at Rs 3 a kg for the poor. But with so many mouths to feed, Kumar was desperate.        
	Desperation nearly wiped out another family, this time in the heart of Delhi.        
	On March 18, Satish Jain, 46, his wife and five daughters drank poison-laced drinks after a suicide pact. The daughters are out of danger, but Jain and his wife are still critical. His eldest daughter has reportedly told the police that on that day, they didnt have even a morsel of food to eat.

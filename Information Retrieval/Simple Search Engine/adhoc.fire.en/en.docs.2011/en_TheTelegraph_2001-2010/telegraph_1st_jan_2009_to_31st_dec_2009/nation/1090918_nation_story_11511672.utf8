The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | MP belongings land on road in House mix-up
                                                                                                               MP belongings land on road in House mix-up
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 17: An MP was today evicted from his official flat and his belongings thrown out on the street, all because the authorities were unaware he had moved from the Lok Sabha to the Rajya Sabha.        
	The Lok Sabha house committee knew that the BJPs Nand Kumar Sai, allotted the flat in 2004, had failed to make it back to the Lower House in 2009. It did not know that the Chhattisgarh MP had been elected to the Upper House since then and had been allotted the same South Avenue flat last month by the Rajya Sabha house committee.        
	So the Lok Sabha committee got in touch with the urban development ministry, whose eviction team left the MPs TV, fridge, couch, almirahs, books, clothes and photographs strewn all over the road outside the flat. Sai was away in Raipur, Chhattisgarh.        
	Its between the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha secretariats. He (Sai) should have shown his regularisation letter (for the flat) and documents to prove he was an MP, urban development secretary M. Ramachandran said.         
	Ministry officials said Sai had had three months to clarify matters after he received the eviction notice on June 18.        
	Sai claimed his staff had told the eviction team to wait for an hour while they brought the regularisation letter from the Rajya Sabha secretariat.        
	But they didnt listen. I know others who are living illegally in government flats and bungalows despite being neither a Rajya Sabha nor a Lok Sabha member.        
	Six former MPs and nine former ministers still occupy their bungalows. They include Mani Shankar Aiyar, Margaret Alva, Jagdish Tytler, Shankersinh Vaghela and Ram Vilas Paswan. All of them, ministry sources said, have been sent notices.

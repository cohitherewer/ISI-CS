The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Summit heat: 4 degrees up

	New Delhi, Dec. 15: All pledges thus far for greenhouse gas emission curbs offered at the Copenhagen summit translate into a nearly 4C increase in the global temperature instead of limiting it to 2C, a global network of environmental groups has said.        
	The computation of how the pledges for emission curbs will drive average global temperatures reflects the gap between the minimum that science demands and the best that the summit appears ready to deliver. The analysis by the Climate Action Network takes into account all the pledges for emission reductions from the developed countries and the actions to limit growth of emissions from the developing countries.        
	If you take the pledges on the table and you add all the loopholes, you actually have increasing emissions, a spokesperson for the network said in Copenhagen. Numerous science groups have been crunching what these emissions add up to in a temperature increase. This particular analysis, which used the same analytical engine used by the US state department, forecasts a 3.9C rise in temperature.        
	The network  echoing the views of negotiating teams from several developing countries  has said the industrialised countries have either not committed enough or not yet stated what their emission reduction targets would be between 2012 and 2020.        
	European Union officials and Americas chief climate negotiator today justified their respective pledges on emission reductions and argued that while they were on track, they expected more action from China  the worlds largest emitter.        
	The EU has pledged to reduce emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 but is holding out the promise that it may increase it to 30 per cent if other large emitters also do more.        
	We want to deliver 30 per cent. But it is conditional, said Andreas Carlgren, environment minister of Sweden, which holds presidency of the EU. Otherwise, we would be selling out our target too cheap without making sure the US and China also deliver sufficiently.        
	If China wouldnt make sure they put real constraints on their emissions, then just the increase of Chinas emissions would eat up all the additional 10 per cent of the EU (emissions) within two years.

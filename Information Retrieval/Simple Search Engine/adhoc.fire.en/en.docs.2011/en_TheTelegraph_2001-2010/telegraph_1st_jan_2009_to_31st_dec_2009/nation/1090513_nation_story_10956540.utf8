The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Clash with China firm
                                                                                                               Clash with China firm
                            
	Bokaro, May 12: Local workers clashed with employees of a Chinese firm building a plant for Calcuttas Electro Casting Steel near here today, apparently over an attendance dispute.        
	A Chinese supervisor and three workers were injured in the three-hour violence at Parbatpur, around 35km from Bokaro, sparking a road blockade and prompting the foreign team to call their embassy in Delhi for protection.        
	The trouble began after the officials of Chinas M.S. Ltd sent back an Indian worker for allegedly skipping duty for several days and filed an FIR following an altercation. The workers demanded that the 600 Chinese be asked to leave.

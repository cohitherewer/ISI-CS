The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Chorus to Congress: Back Draupadi
                                                                                                               Chorus to Congress: Back Draupadi
          BASANT RAWAT                          Mallika: Taking on Advani                                  
	Ahmedabad, April 3: Gandhian Chuni Vaidya has no doubt who is best suited to take on L.K. Advani in the Gandhinagar seat.        
	Mallika Draupadi Sarabhai, not the pygmy Congress candidate, Suresh Patel.        
	Vaidya is among many who appealed to the Congress to withdraw its nominee and make the Independent Mallika, an internationally known dancer and actress, the common candidate against Advani.        
	I have written to Sonia Gandhi, Vaidya told The Telegraph. Patel (a little-known legislator) is a pygmy before Advani; theres no point fielding him. Instead, the Congress should support Mallika, a woman of substance.        
	Vaidya added: I have urged Sonia Gandhi to be large-hearted like Jawaharlal Nehru, who had accommodated bitter critics of the party in his ministry like B.R. Ambedkar.        
	One reason is Mallikas profile. The 55-year-old IIM Ahmedabad graduate, who played Draupadi in Peter Brooks The Mahabharata, has overwhelming support not only from artistes and the film fraternity but also from the likes of Salman Rushdie, jurist V.R. Krishna Iyer and industrialist N.R. Narayana Murthy.        
	She was the first to bring the atrocities on the minorities during the 2002 riots to the notice of the courts. She is capable of uniting civil society against the icon of communal and reactionary forces, said Dwarika Nath, a member of a citizens group that too has asked the Congress to support her.        
	Here lie some of the Congresss problems. Mallika had sought a CBI probe into the riots, prompting the state government to lodge what she says were false cases of human trafficking against her. Analysts say the Congress, ever unsure how strident an anti-Hindutva line to take in Gujarat, fears that backing Mallika could turn off Hindus.        
	Besides, Mallika has been a Congress critic. She had accused Congress and BJP goons of together disrupting a meeting she had organised after the riots because Medha Patkar had been a guest.        
	Congress spokesperson Arjun Modhwadia said: We are not against a neutral and Independent candidate like Mallika Sarabhai. But we are a mainstream political party. We have a strong support base in Gandhinagar  out of its seven Assembly seats, the Congress holds two. Besides, the Congress controls the Gandhinagar district panchayat and taluka panchayat. We dont want to surrender our vote bank and party symbol.

                                                                                                               Hair dryer shock kills Pak official
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 12: A senior diplomat with the Pakistan high commission died last night after being electrocuted while using a hair dryer, police said.        
	Political counsellor Mohabbat Khan Afridi, 47, reportedly got the shock around 9.30 in the bathroom at his official residence in Vasant Vihar.        
	 His family broke open the bathroom door and found his hand charred, sources said. He was immediately taken to Fortis hospital nearby, where he was declared dead on arrival.        
	Afridi, who was of brigadier rank, is survived by his wife and two school-going children.         
	The incident took place at the official residence of the diplomat.... Since he had diplomatic immunity, the body was allowed to leave without the usual procedures. It (the death) was probably caused by an electrical short-circuit, a police officer said.         
	The body was sent to Pakistan today through the Wagah border.

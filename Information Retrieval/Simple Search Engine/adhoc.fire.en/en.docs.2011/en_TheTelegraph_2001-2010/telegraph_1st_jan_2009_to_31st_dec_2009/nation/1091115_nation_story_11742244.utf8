  - Public money siphoned off to fund film          OUR CORRESPONDENT      
	Cuttack, Nov. 14: Orissa High Court will allow a parallel probe into the multi-crore chit fund scam in which public money was siphoned off from the state and allegedly diverted to Bollywood for production of the film Shadow.        
	The high court allowed the Enforcement Directorate to go ahead with the investigation keeping in view of the findings of the CID.        
	Investigations had revealed that money collected from poor and unsuspecting people in Orissa by offering high and attractive rates of interest and returns was then transferred to accounts in Kanpur, Mumbai, Delhi and other places.        
	The CID had got the massive transfer of money involving more than Rs 100 crore investigated by the regional economic intelligence committee.        
	A division bench was hearing yesterday an intervention petition filed by the Enforcement Directorate in connection with the cases related to freezing of bank accounts of several marketing companies.        
	Additional solicitor-general Shaktidhar Das told the bench that the Enforcement Directorate had started investigating the case, as the transfer of money impinges on the financial regulation of the country and Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines.        
	The CID informed the court that interrogation of Nasir Khan was imperative, but it had not been possible so far due to non-cooperation by the actor-cum-co-producer of the film. Though a notice was issued to him to appear before the investigating officer on November 3, he was yet to respond.        
	The bench issued notice to Khan to show cause as to why the bail granted to him should not be revoked.         
	CID sleuths had taken Khan into custody on October 20, but had to release him immediately as the high court allowed him bail on PR bond.

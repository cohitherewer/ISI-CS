          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Dec. 26: The controversy over Foreign Exchange Management Act (Fema) violations by several banks while selling forex derivative products to companies, importers and exporters in 2007-08 has taken a new turn with Orissa High Court insisting on a CBI probe into it.        
	The CBI probe order assumes significance, as it has come at a time when several Indian companies saddled with crores of dollars of losses in currency derivatives are in dispute with banks, which had sold them the foreign exchange derivative contracts.        
	The companies had bought the derivative contracts during the market boom apparently looking to boost profits. The derivatives initially brought in profits and banks charged fees on those transactions. But the companies lost heavily in currency derivatives when the markets fell.        
	The controversy sparked off when the loss-making companies raised disputes alleging that the derivative contracts were sold by banks as financial instruments for speculation without any intention of providing insurance against fluctuations in the market.         
	The issue was raised before the Orissa High Court through a PIL by Prabanjan Patra, a city-based lawyer, in August.

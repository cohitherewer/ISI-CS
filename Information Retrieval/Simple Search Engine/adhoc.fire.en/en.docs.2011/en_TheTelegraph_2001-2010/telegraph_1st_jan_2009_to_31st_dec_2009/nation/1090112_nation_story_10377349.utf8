The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Force abuse cases rise 
                                                                                                               Force abuse cases rise 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 11: Cases alleging human rights abuse by Indias paramilitary forces have almost tripled over the past three years, data compiled by the home ministry show.        
	The number of rights abuse-related cases against paramilitary personnel rose from 61 in 2004-05 to 180 in 2007-08.         
	The data, shared by the home ministry with the National Human Rights Commission in response to queries, lend credibility to repeated claims of such abuses by activist groups.         
	Paramilitary forces are deployed to curb rebel activities in vast swathes of insurgency-stricken areas across the country  from states in the Northeast to Chhattisgarh and Jammu and Kashmir.         
	In the Northeast and Jammu and Kashmir, the forces are mainly battling separatists, while in states like Chhattisgarh, their challenge is to contain Naxalites.         
	Civil rights activists have long accused security forces  including paramilitary personnel  of frequent abuse while conducting anti-rebel operations in these areas.         
	International groups like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have also repeatedly alleged rights abuse by Indian security forces. Over the past two years, they have hinted that such cases were on the rise.         
	But government officials, though not denying the possibility of rights abuse, have tended to dismiss the claims as exaggerations.         
	The latest home ministry data, however, suggest a substantial rise in perceptions of rights abuse by paramilitary forces that is unlikely to prove helpful in tackling extremism.         
	Cases against the forces had declined in 2004-05 from 95 the previous year.         
	But a surge in the cases, particularly related to allegations of fake encounters, death in arbitrary firing and abuse of power by the forces, has since taken the tally upwards.         
	The year 2007-08 saw 10 cases of alleged fake encounters against just one, two or none at all in previous years. Cases of alleged abuse of power in 2007-08 numbered 33 compared with 13 in 2004-05.         
	The home ministry has listed 21 cases of death by arbitrary firing in 2007-08 compared with six in 2004-05.

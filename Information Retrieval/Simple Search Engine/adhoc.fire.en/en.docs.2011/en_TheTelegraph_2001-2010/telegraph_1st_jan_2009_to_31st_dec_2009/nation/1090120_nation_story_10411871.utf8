The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Civic poll without ex-mayor
                                                                                                               Civic poll without ex-mayor
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Jan. 19: The first mayor of Cuttack, Nibedita Pradhan, said that she would not seek re-election this year.        
	After much thought and consideration, I decided not to seek re-election to the Cuttack Municipal Corporation council, she announced late on Sunday, two days after filing nomination papers.        
	It has been a privilege and honour to serve the residents of Cuttack for the past 10 years, the first six as a councillor. The decision not to seek re-election was not an easy one to reach, Pradhan added.         
	Even as the BJP leader  a spinster in her late forties  claimed that the delay in finding a suitable replacement prompted her to file her nomination from ward No. 21, there were signs of fissures within the party in the city.        
	The whole episode was a manifestation of bitter infighting within the BJP. It was part of the apparently ongoing tussle between two factions. City MLA and higher education minister Samir Dey, Pradhan and followers are on one side and the RSS loyalists are on the other, insiders said.

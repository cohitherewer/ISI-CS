                                                                                                               US vows non-stop chase of terrorists
          OUR BUREAU                          Mulford in New Delhi on Friday. Ramakant Kushwaha                                  
	Jan. 9: US ambassador David Mulford today said America would pursue the Mumbai attackers non-stop till they were brought to book but was cautious about the alleged hand of official Pakistani agencies in the attacks.        
	The US will go on non-stop as long as it takes in pursuing the perpetrators of the Mumbai terror attacks, Mulford, asked to stay on in Delhi a few more weeks by the incoming Obama regime, said at a CII programme in Delhi.        
	When Americans are killed anywhere, we pursue those people and that is what we are up to in Pakistan. We will press ahead and we will do it non-stop as long as it takes.        
	But the envoy refused to point a finger at Pakistani agencies, accused by Manmohan Singh of having a role in the attacks.        
	I dont think we want to take a view that we make accusations against certain parties without the usual evidences, proofs, he said, adding the attacks appeared to have been managed and monitored from there.        
	In Mumbai, US assistant secretary of state Richard Boucher kept up the heat, saying Pakistan could not have two sets of views about terrorists.        
	We want to get to the bottom of this. Pakistan cannot have different views about terrorists who attacked Marriott hotel in their country and terror attacks in Kashmir or Mumbai.        
	We want to make sure the groups that were involved, the groups that originated this attack in Pakistan, those groups are shut down, put out of business, brought to justice.        
	The comments came on a day incoming US Vice-President Joe Biden flew to Islamabad and Pakistan Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani sought international help to defuse bilateral tension.        
	The situation on our eastern borders has once again become very fragile, Gilani said at a seminar, ruing Delhis decision to freeze the bilateral peace process.        
	Later, he told reporters the ISI had given its feedback to India on some information on the Mumbai attacks that Delhi had shared with American intelligence agency CIA.        
	Our ISI has given its feedback and shared information. That has been passed on to India, he said.        
	Sources in Delhi, however, disagreed. We havent got any reply from Pakistan on evidence shared with them, an official said.

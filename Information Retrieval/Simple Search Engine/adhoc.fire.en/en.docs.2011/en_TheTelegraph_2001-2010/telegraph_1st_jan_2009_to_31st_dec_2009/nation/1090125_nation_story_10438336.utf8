	Bangalore, Jan. 24: A young marketing executive racing home after a night with a friend mowed down four morning-walkers, including a doctor, and a cyclist today.        
	Karthik Somaiah ploughed his Honda Accord through the pavement where the trio were on a stroll after hitting the cyclist in Bangalores Shivaji Nagar area.        
	The 30-year-old abandoned the car, apparently out of panic, and fled the scene but gave himself up to police this evening. Somaiah, a client servicing executive, was returning to his Indiranagar home after spending the night at a friends house in Koramangala. The police didnt say if he was drunk.        
	The incident occurred between 6am. and 6.30am and all four (victims) died instantly, a traffic police official said.        
	Eyewitnesses said the car, being driven at very high speed, spun out of control and climbed on to the footpath.        
	The police said Somaiah, who had left his licence in the car before escaping, would be booked for culpable homicide. A court application will be filed to cancel his licence.        
	The victims have been identified as Dr. Panathur, 65, Siddaiah, 65, Kempegowda, 65, and cyclist Radhakrishna, 45. One person was injured but is out of danger.        
	Police said the Honda Accord was registered in the name of a private firm, Mitsun Steel Company but company sources said they had sold the car a few months ago.        
	Somaiah and his family had been missing for hours from their home after the incident, the police said, amid reports the young man had been advised by his lawyer to surrender.        
	We have got the vehicle. We know the details. We will arrest the culprit in about two to three hours, Bangalore police chief Shankar Bidar had said early in the day.        
	Mumbai businessman Alistair Pereira, 21, was sentenced to three years in jail and fined Rs 5 lakh for running over seven pavement dwellers in November 2006.        
	Sanjeev Nanda, grandson of ex-navy chief S.M. Nanda, was punished with a five-year jail term in the 1999 BMW hit-and-run-case in which six people had died.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Kasab lawyer pulls out
                                                                                                               Kasab lawyer pulls out
          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                          Waghmare (top), Kasab                                  
	Mumbai, March 30: Gunman Ajmal Kasab got a lawyer today after months of boycott by the legal fraternity but late tonight, reports emerged that she had withdrawn under pressure from the Shiv Sena.        
	Sources said well past midnight that Anjali Waghmare, a criminal and civil lawyer married to a police inspector, had given an undertaking to a group of Sena supporters that she would not represent Kasab. The claim could not be confirmed with Waghmare.        
	The sources said the group of Sena protesters besieged her house at Worli police quarters, the place where the late Tukaram Oomble who caught Kasab stayed.        
	The sources said Waghmare late tonight sent a letter to the Sena, which had demanded that Kasab be hanged in public, saying that she was withdrawing the vakalatnama.        
	Waghmare, 40, is a lawyer from the state legal aid panel, and was scheduled to defend Kasab when trial starts on April 6 at Arthur Road jail.        
	At todays sessions court hearing, where the 21-year-old Pakistani appeared on a video link, special judge M.L. Tahilyani told him Waghmare had been chosen to represent him.        
	Kasab, looking relaxed in a grey T-shirt, smiled and said: Okay sir.        
	The judge asked Waghmare, wife of assistant inspector of police Ramesh Waghmare, to come up before the video camera and introduced her to Kasab.        
	In the evening, asked by reporters if she would demand security considering the earlier Shiv Sena attacks on lawyers willing to defend Kasab, Waghmare said: I dont want to demand any security from the state. I trust the citizens of Mumbai.        
	She added: People know that unless Kasab gets legal representation, this trial will not proceed. It is important that the trial should be smooth and fair. I have been appointed by the state and am aware of my rights and duties.        
	Tahilyani told Kasab that Waghmare would brief him on April 6 and help him understand the chargesheet. The document is written in Marathi, which the Urdu-speaking Kasab does not follow.        
	Waghmare, a law graduate from Punes Symbiosis College, has been practising since 1996 and working with the legal aid panel since 1999. She has appeared in cases under the stringent crime law MCOCA, and represented 1993 blasts accused Karimullah, charged with ferrying explosives.        
	Waghmare refused to state her reasons for agreeing to defend Kasab. My name was short-listed and I was asked to appear in the court today if I wished to represent Kasab.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       The former sepoy in custody. (Deepak Kumar)                          
	Patna, Sept. 22: A dismissed Indian Army sepoy, allegedly on the payroll of Pakistans Inter-service Intelligence (ISI), has been arrested here with very important military papers.        
	Special task force (STF) arrested Sudhanshu Sudhakar from his Kankarbagh-based house, said additional director-general (police headquarters) Neelmani, describing the arrest as a big catch.        
	Acting on a tip-off from the intelligence bureau (IB), STF and Patna police raided a house under Kankarbagh police station area last night where Sudhanshu was staying.        
	Police claim to have recovered from him details of a Nalanda-based Army ordinance factory, still under construction, besides important military secrets related to the western side of India-Pakistan border and details of a process of recruitment for the Indian Army.        
	So far, the force has lodged an FIR against Sudhansu under Official Secrets Act. They have also informed the Union home ministry and IB regarding the arrest, which comes days before the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan are set to meet in New York.        
	Top police sources are not ready to share details of the arrested man due to security-related issues. Sources revealed that some military details recovered from Sudhanshus possession were in his handwriting.        
	Sudhanshu belongs to the Bazaar Samiti area of north Bihars Sitamarhi on the India-Nepal border. He joined the Indian Army in 2000 and was court marshalled in 2007.         
	The accused confessed he was sent to Nepal thrice by an Islamabad-based spy agency for an assignment, said a source on condition of anonymity.        
	STF has been raiding places in Madhubani and Darbhanga on the basis of information received from Sudhanshu in course of his interrogation.        
	In January, New Delhi police arrested Mohammad Omar Madni, a top aid of Hafeez Mohammad Sayeed, a Lashkar-e-Toiba leader.        
	Madni, who belonged to Balkatwa village in Madhubani of Bihar, also had migrated to Nepal from where he joined the terrorist group.        
	Intelligence sources believe that Nepal is one of the nerve centres of ISI operations against India.         
	The Border Security Force had arrested two Nepalese citizens, Shyam Kumar Sah and Azad Alam, from Raxaul, a Bihar town on India-Nepal border, and had recovered fake Indian notes worth Rs 40,000 on September 9.

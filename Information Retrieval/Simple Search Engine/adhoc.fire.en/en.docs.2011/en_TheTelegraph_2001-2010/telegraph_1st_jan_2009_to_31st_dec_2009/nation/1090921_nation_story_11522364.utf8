                                                                                                               PM health check-up
                            
	New Delhi, Sept. 20 (PTI): Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is in the pink of his health ahead of his visit to the US this week, doctors said today.        
	A routine health check-up was conducted by a team of four doctors led by Srinath Reddy, chief of the Prime Ministers treatment committee, three days before Singhs visit to the US to attend the G20 summit.        
	The team of doctors included Ramakant Panda, the surgeon who conducted a heart operation on the 76-year-old Prime Minister in January.        
	After the check-up, Panda said the Prime Minister is in the pink of his health, according to official sources.        
	He needs only one check-up every year as he is religiously following his diet and exercising regularly, they said.

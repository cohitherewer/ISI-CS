The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Gogoi rues security lapse
                                                                                                               Gogoi rues security lapse
          OUR BUREAU                          Singh: Ready with help                                  
	April 7: Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi today conceded that security lapses had allowed Ulfa militants to strike yesterday as the toll in the Maligaon and Dhekiajuli blasts mounted to 10.         
	The admission came even as a Union home ministry statement rued that the banned Ulfa, an old adversary, had been able to strike despite intelligence inputs.         
	Information was available about names of Ulfa commanders/cadres who will attempt to explode IEDs. Many advisories were sent to the security forces as well as to the government of Assam to remain extremely vigilant during this period. It is unfortunate and deeply regretted that the adversary has been able to strike this time, the statement said.         
	Gogoi briefed Prime Minister Manmohan Singh  whose rally in Dibrugarh was cancelled following heavy rain  at a meeting with officials of the state administration and police.        
	These incidents will have to be looked into and the Centre is ready to provide all help. There is no place for violence in a democracy, an aide quoted Singh as saying.        
	The police were facing a daunting task identifying the perpetrators of the Maligaon blast with Ulfa allegedly using new recruits to carry out strikes in Guwahati, sources said.         
	The militants who were behind the latest string of attacks in the city were new Ulfa recruits who had undergone short-term training sessions of 15 to 20 days in the use of arms and explosives. We do not have details about them nor can our spotters recognise them, a police source said.         
	Sonitpur police picked up four persons, including two former Ulfa cadres, in connection with the Dhekiajuli blast.        
	Gogoi told reporters no one would be spared if found guilty of dereliction of duty. This is the first time in recent memory that Gogoi has departed from merely dubbing Ulfa acts cowardly and instead pointed fingers at the polices failure.        
	The chief minister said his government had ordered a thorough inquiry into the lapses. We will definitely initiate strong disciplinary measures against any official found to be negligent. At the same time we will also evolve a mechanism to provide adequate security to the people.

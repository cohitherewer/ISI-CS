The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rabri gag after Nitish gaffe
                                                                                                               Rabri gag after Nitish gaffe

	Patna, April 6: Lalu Prasad has asked wife Rabri Devi not to campaign for a while after her recent remarks on Nitish Kumar created a furore, Rashtriya Janata Dal sources said today.        
	They added that Rabri (in picture), a former chief minister, would not address her scheduled meetings in Karakat and Gaya tomorrow. A party release published in local dailies mentions these venues but the RJD office told The Telegraph: Madam has no programmes tomorrow.        
	At a rally in Saran on Saturday, Rabri had allegedly used the Hindi word for brother-in-law against Bihar chief minister Nitish and Janata Dal (United) state president Lallan Singh. The Dal (U) yesterday complained to the Election Commission about the abusive language while the NDA legal cell today lodged a case against her in Patna High Court.        
	RJD sources said several party candidates had urged Lalu Prasad to keep Rabri out of the campaign.        
	Rabri, however, did address todays meetings at Madanpur (Aurangabad) and Sasaram, where workers had already announced her arrival.         
	RJD sources said Lalu Prasad told Rabri this morning she must not say anything about Nitish but could speak on L.K. Advani.        
	At Aurangabad, she said: Mosque-breaker Advani is dreaming to become Prime Minister. I will not let him realise his dream.        
	Asked to comment on the controversy, Lalu Prasad said: Nitish Kumar is my younger brother. We are political people.... There is no need to say anything more.        
	Suman vs Shatru        
	The Congress today fielded TV star Shekhar Suman against the BJPs Shatrughan Sinha from Patna Saheb in Bihar.

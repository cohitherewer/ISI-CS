The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Provogue owner off cocaine hook
                                                                                                               Provogue owner off cocaine hook
                            
	Mumbai, April 3 (PTI): Salil Chaturvedi, the owner of apparel brand Provogue who was caught in a narcotics case, was acquitted today.        
	A special narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances court acquitted him after the prosecution failed to prove conclusively that the three grams of cocaine allegedly found in his Lokhandwala bungalow belonged to him.        
	Judge A.T. Amlekar said the prosecution had failed to prove that the house was in the exclusive possession of the accused.        
	When the police raided Chaturvedis residence, there were many persons present there, including his wife, other relatives and servants. There is no evidence to prove that the recovered drugs belonged to the accused, his lawyer Rizwan Merchant said.        
	The case dates back to January 26, 2005, when police detained designer Allwyn Sequeira, who was allegedly carrying vials of cocaine in a parcel to be delivered to Chennai.        
	The Chennai address belonged to former Provogue manager Vishal Maghnani, who was arrested on June 23, 2005. Two policemen were also held in July the same year for allegedly trying to replace the cocaine with boric powder and extort money from Maghnani.         
	A month later, on August 2, Chaturvedi was held for the cocaine found in his house. He maintained that the drugs were planted there by the raiding police party and he had nothing to do with the narcotics trade. Based on his allegations in 2007, a sessions court ordered an inquiry against the three policemen who had raided his house.         
	A reprieve for Chaturvedi came in February last year when Bombay High Court said he should be tried separately from the other accused.        
	His lawyers had argued that the accused were not arrested at the same time and the quantity of narcotics seized was different. So, they could not be brought under the same case.

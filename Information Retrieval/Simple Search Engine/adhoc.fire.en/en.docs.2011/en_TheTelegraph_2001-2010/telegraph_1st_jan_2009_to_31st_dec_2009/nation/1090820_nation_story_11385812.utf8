          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 19: The cabinet may tomorrow approve proposed legal amendments recognising degrees offered by the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISER), ending a nervous three-year wait for the science hubs conceived by the Prime Minister.         
	The amendments to the National Institutes of Technology Act of 2007 are scheduled to be discussed by the cabinet at its weekly meeting tomorrow, senior government officials told The Telegraph.        
	The amendments officially recognise degrees offered by the IISERs, envisaged by the Prime Ministers scientific advisory council as institutions tasked to build a cadre of young scientists who can spearhead the countrys research in the future. Over 550 students study at the five IISERs.         
	The IISERs at Calcutta and Pune started offering their unique five-year integrated masters programmes in the sciences in 2006 but their degrees are still not recognised. A third institute was started at Mohali in 2007 and two others were started last year in Thiruvananthapuram and Bhopal.        
	Under pressure from students and parents, the directors and teachers of these institutions have repeatedly petitioned the HRD ministry to urgently recognise the degrees.         
	Only universities, institutions created through a law in Parliament or a state legislature  like the IITs  and deemed universities can offer degrees. The IIMs, which come under none of these categories, can only offer diplomas, for instance.         
	The ministry and the IISERs initially worked on drafting a law specifically for these science institutes. Subsequently, the ministry decided to dovetail the IISERs into the NIT Act.

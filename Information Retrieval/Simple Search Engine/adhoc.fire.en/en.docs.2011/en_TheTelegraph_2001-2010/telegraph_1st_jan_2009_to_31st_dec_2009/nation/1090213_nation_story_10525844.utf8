                                                                                                               Girl suicide finger at moral cops
          A CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bangalore, Feb. 12: A schoolgirls suicide threatens the fragile peace in place in Mangalore, where moral policing by Hindutva groups triggered a countrywide uproar.         
	Ashwini, a Class IX student, hanged herself at her home in Mulky yesterday, a day after she was seen with Saleem, 22, the son of a bus owner, in a remote area near Maroor.         
	Her father Jayamoolya, a day labourer, lodged a complaint with police accusing Saleem of raping her and abetting the suicide. The police said Ashwini regularly travelled to school by Saleems bus and he had persuaded her to go with him yesterday.        
	However, local newspapers quoted eyewitnesses as saying the two were stopped and humiliated by a Hindutva group, suggesting this drove the girl to commit suicide.         
	A PTI report said a group of suspected Sangh parivar activists took Saleem, Ashwini and a friend who was with her to Maroor police station. The police called Ashwinis parents and handed her over to them. The schoolgirl committed suicide last night, but did not leave any note behind.         
	Mangalore SP N. Sathish Kumar said the police did not have evidence of involvement of any group.

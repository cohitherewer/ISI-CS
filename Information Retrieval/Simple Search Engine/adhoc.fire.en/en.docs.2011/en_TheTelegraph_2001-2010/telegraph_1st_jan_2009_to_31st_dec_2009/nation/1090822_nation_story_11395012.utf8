                                                                                                               Poll relief for creamy layer
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 21: The concept of creamy layer, used to keep the well-off among the backward classes from the benefits of job and education quotas, will not extend to political reservations for now.        
	The Supreme Court today permitted creamy layer backward-class candidates to contest the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation polls. In an interim order, the court allowed the corporation to go ahead with the polls.        
	Andhra Pradesh High Court had stayed the polls on the ground that the civic body had failed to keep out the creamy layer, as mandated by the municipal act. A central order defines creamy layer candidates, in the matter of education and job quotas, as those with annual incomes of Rs 4.5 lakh or more.        
	The apex court clarified, however, that the poll results would be subject to the orders of the high court, which would decide whether the creamy layer principle should cover political reservations. Let (the) candidates take the risk, the bench said.        
	The states Congress government had appealed against the high court order. In the Supreme Court, the state was represented by attorney-general G.E. Vahanvati and the corporation by solicitor-general Gopal Subramanium. They argued that creamy layer candidates could not be denied the right to contest.        
	Fifty of the civic bodys 150 wards are reserved for the backward classes.

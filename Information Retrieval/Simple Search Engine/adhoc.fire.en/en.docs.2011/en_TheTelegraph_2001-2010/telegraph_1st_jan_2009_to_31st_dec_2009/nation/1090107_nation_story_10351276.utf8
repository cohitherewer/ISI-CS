                                                                                                               Interim stay on poll date row
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Jan. 6: The controversy over the Orissa High Courts restriction on notification of the date of civic polls in Cuttack by the state election commission has taken a significant turn with the Supreme Court imposing an injunction on it today.        
	The division bench of Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan and Justice P. Sathasivam granted interim stay on operation of the high courts order and posted hearing our petition to January 16, the commissions counsel, Pitambar Acharya, said from New Delhi.         
	The term of the last council of Cuttack Municipal Corporation (CMC) expired on September 29, 2008. But election has not been possible so far because of legal disputes over ward delimitation and reservation since notification on it was issued on February 20, 2008.        
	According to the Article 243 (U) of the Constitution, civic body election is to be completed before the expiry of the five-year term. The commission has challenged the interim restriction clamped since December 18, 2008, after a fresh dispute over delimitation and reservation of wards under CMC was raised before it through a writ petition by a former corporator. In the petition, we questioned the jurisdiction of the high court to entertain the writ petition and grant interlocutory order stalling the election process after commencement of the same since December 12, 2008, Acharya said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Winter session straw for Advani
                                                                                                               Winter session straw for Advani
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Advani                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 28: L.K. Advani is expected to continue as Opposition leader in the Lok Sabha during the winter session of Parliament that begins from November 19.        
	The clearest indication of this came in a luncheon meeting today between Advani and RSS sarsanghachalak Mohanrao Bhagwat at the BJP veterans house.        
	RSS and BJP sources maintained that the discussions centred around who should take over as party president when Rajnath Singhs term ends in December.         
	Asked before a book launch in the evening if Advanis continuance had cropped up during the talks, Bhagwat said: These things are not talked about in one-on-one meetings. They are discussed in groups.        
	There was another sign the veteran would stay in the post for now. Advani has sought a briefing on climate change and global warming from Jairam Ramesh, the minister for environment and forests, before the session begins because the BJP will ask for a discussion on the subject.        
	The consultations with Bhagwat on Rajnaths successor offered two pointers. One, Advani will have a decisive say in the matter and not be ignored or side-stepped by the Sangh, as some in the BJP wish to believe. Second, the RSS, more specifically Bhagwat, are shedding the bravado they publicly exuded three months ago when he issued the six commandments outlining his vision of the BJP and gave an impression he was about to appropriate the party.        
	Sources said there were two reasons for what was being acknowledged as a climbdown on Bhagwats part by his own acolytes in the BJP. He revealed his hand vis-a-vis the BJP a little too openly, more than any of his predecessors including (K.S.) Sudarshan ever did. This in a sense compromised the Sanghs position among its own cadres who are still brought up on the myth that they have nothing to do with politics and politicking, said a source.        
	Second, two senior colleagues of Bhagwat, Madan Das Devi and Suresh Soni  who have been point men with the BJP  impressed on him that the changes should be phased out and a new Opposition leader appointed only after the next BJP president was installed. Had Bhagwat insisted on Advanis departure, it would not have been a consensus decision of the RSS, the source said.        
	Apart from Bhagwat and the RSSs inner powerplay, there is a political sub-text to Advani staying on: the turmoil in Rajasthan, where the BJP is in Opposition, and in Karnataka, where the party is ruling with a majority.        
	The view among many is that with Rajnath fast losing whatever authority he might have had, Advanis absence would leave the BJP without the only fulcrum it had, even if it was somewhat weak. Things might then fall apart faster than we think, the source said.        
	The trouble in Karnataka was evident today when senior leader Arun Jaitley rushed to Bangalore after reports of how chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappas authority had been challenged by the influential Reddy brothers, who own mines in Bellary, and MLAs loyal to Bangalore MP and general secretary Ananth Kumar.        
	In Rajasthan, Vasundhara Raje, who resigned as the leader of the BJP legislature party, said she would tour the state, the move being seen as an attempt to assert her strength on the ground.

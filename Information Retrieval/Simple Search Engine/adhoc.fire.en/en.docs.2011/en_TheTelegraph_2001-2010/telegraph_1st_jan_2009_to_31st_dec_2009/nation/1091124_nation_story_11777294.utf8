          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi Nov. 23: One of the four outsiders at the centre of yesterdays clash between students and police at JNU was an ex-student, police said today.        
	Deputy commissioner of police (south) H.G.S. Dhaliwal identified the ex-student as Gagan Kumar and said he along with friends Nitin Kapoor, Ankit Nanda and Amit Chauhan had been booked for non-bailable offences.         
	The four were accused of drinking, threatening a guard and misbehaving with girls on the campus. Students had tried to stop the police from taking away the four saying they should apologise first, sparking the fracas.        
	The JNU Students Union (JNUSU) today issued a release condemning the police action. Delhi Police-Rapid Action Force unleashed a brutal lathicharge against the protestors (students). Several students had to be hospitalised. The police also picked up several students who were later released on the intervention of teachers.         
	DCP Dhaliwal suggested the cops used force under extreme pressure. We used force when some of the students tried to set on fire a police jeep.         
	PhD student Vibha Iyer said she was almost knocked down by the Hyundai Accent in which the four had come to the campus. Their car almost knocked me and my friend down and they started passing lewd remarks. I reported the matter to a guard. Another student, Saurabh Gupta, said one of the four put a gun on the guards head saying he was the son of a senior police officer.

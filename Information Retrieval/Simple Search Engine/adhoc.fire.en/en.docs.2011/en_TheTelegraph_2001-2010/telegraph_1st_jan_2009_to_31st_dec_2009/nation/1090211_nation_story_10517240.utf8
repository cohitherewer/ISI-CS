The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | God help us, court tells CBI
                                                                                                               God help us, court tells CBI
                              Mulayam: Long wait                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 10 (PTI): The Supreme Court today pulled up the CBI for acting at the behest of the central government while handling an assets case against Mulayam Singh Yadav.        
	You are acting at the behest of the central government and the law ministry. You are not acting on your own, the bench of Justices Altmas Kabir and Cyriac Joseph said.        
	The lash came after additional solicitor-general Mohan Parasaran said the opinion of the law ministry was taken to withdraw an application under which the CBI had sought filing of an inquiry report before the apex court, not the government.        
	Do you realise what you are saying? It is very unusual. It is because the central government gave (its) opinion that you filed the interim application (for withdrawal of the earlier plea seeking to file the report on the inquiry to the apex court), the bench said.         
	Why did you file the interim application on the opinion of the central government? it asked. It is incomprehensible. If this is the ground for filing the interim application, God help us.        
	The bench wanted to know whether it was the CBIs practice to seek the opinion of the law ministry. Parasaran said it is and this is not the only case or the only precedent. He added that the CBI would abide by the directive of the court and that he wanted to straighten the case.        
	This did not impress the bench. Why did you go to the central government? You should have come to us, it said, before reserving the order on the applications filed by the CBI and others.        
	The judges wanted to know from the additional solicitor-general what other grounds the CBI had to support the application for withdrawal of its earlier plea, apart from the opinion of the law ministry.         
	Parasaran said there were other legal grounds, more in the nature of technical submissions. The bench asked: You have nothing better than this?        
	When Parasaran said in no way was the CBI going to be influenced, the judges countered him, saying: If you are not going to be influenced, then why dont you withdraw your application? That ends the matter.         
	Solicitor-general G.E. Vahanvati said the law ministry only wanted to verify the facts as representations had been received from Mulayams family. All we said was to go through the representations. We said we dont want to take a decision. Thats all, he said.        
	The court had ordered the CBI inquiry on March 1, 2007, into the alleged disproportionate assets of Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam and his family on a PIL.         
	Prosecution lawyer K.T.S. Tulsi has alleged that despite the courts caution, the CBI chose to take directives from the Centre.

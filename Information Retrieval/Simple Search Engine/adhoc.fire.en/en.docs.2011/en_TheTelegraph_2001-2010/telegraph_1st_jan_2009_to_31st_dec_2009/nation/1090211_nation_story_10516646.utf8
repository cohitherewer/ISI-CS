The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bribe first for doc and CBI sleuth
                                                                                                               Bribe first for doc and CBI sleuth
          G.S. MUDUR AND SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 10: Doctor Kunal Saha wasnt the only one seeing it happening for the first time. It was a first for the CBI investigator too.        
	A day after the CBI arrested two Supreme Court employees, one from the courts registry, for demanding bribe from Saha, the Ohio-based doctor said a sleuth involved in the sting had told him he had never trapped anyone from the courts bureaucracy before.        
	The registry is the courts executive arm and all employees are governed by strict rules that dont allow dealing in stocks and shares. Under the Supreme Court Officers and Servants (Conditions of Services and Conduct) Rules, 1961, employees are also expected to report to seniors any big land transaction.         
	A senior advocate, too, said he couldnt recall another instance when an official of the courts registry had been trapped in this manner.        
	A Delhi court today remanded C. Perumal, an upper division clerk, K.S. Badrinath, an assistant-grade employee in the court registry, and another person, K.M. Singh, in police custody for a day, a PTI report said.        
	Saha, who is seeking punishment for three Calcutta doctors for alleged medical negligence which he says led to his wife Anuradhas death in 1998, planned the sting after the court employees demanded Rs 75,000 to list his case.        
	The NRI doctor, whose appeal filed in 2005 had not come up for hearing yet, had decided on a hunger strike from last Friday. The offer came a day before we were to begin the hunger strike, he told The Telegraph. On Thursday, a person came up to us and said he could get the case listed for Rs 75,000. I had heard of this kind of thing  but here it was happening to me.        
	Saha contacted the CBI and the sting was planned on Monday morning. In the afternoon, officials taped a telephone conversation between Saha and one of the accused in which the doctor agreed to pay Rs 25,000 as first instalment.        
	In the evening, CBI officials arrested one of the accused who turned up at Sahas hotel room and accepted the money  marked by the agency.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Risky to even talk to women: Tiwari
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Risky to even talk to women: Tiwari

	Lucknow, Dec. 29: Walking with the support of two aides, Narain Datt Tiwari, the 86-year-old sleaze-hit Congressman, has linked the sex scandal that forced his exit as Andhra Pradesh governor to the Telangana movement and pointed to his age to suggest he was the victim of a political conspiracy.         
	Tiwari, a former external affairs minister and chief minister of undivided Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, resigned on Saturday, a day after a Telugu news channel aired a report alleging a sex scandal at the Raj Bhavan in Hyderabad.        
	The octogenarian leader, who had so far been silent on the scandal and instead ascribed his resignation to health grounds, returned to his bungalow on the campus of the Forest Research Institute in Dehra Dun yesterday. The house was allotted to him when he became chief minister of Uttarakhand in 2002.        
	Tiwari, who had flown to Delhi from Hyderabad yesterday but had kept his schedule under wraps, hobbled out of a chartered flight at Dehra Duns Jolly Grant Airport around 6pm yesterday.         
	In spite of the biting cold  the Uttarakhand capital has been shivering at 4 degrees Celsius, the 86-year-old looked the archetypal Congressman: clad in a fading khaki-coloured Nehru suit, off white trousers and Gandhian cap on his dishevelled and receding hair.         
	Limping and hardly able to walk, Tiwari craned his eyes to look for media personnel he knew. When he found two of them present there, he made a passing reference to the conspiracy against him in Andhra Pradesh and linked it to the statehood movement.         
	I apologise to the nation but I have done no wrong. I have been framed. It is a political conspiracy, he said.        
	It (the allegations) is baseless, fake. It is now risky to even talk to a woman, Tiwari said.        
	The Telangana fight is going on... The President was to come there (Hyderabad). People wanted to meet me... Some of them were not happy for I, as governor, could not meet their expectations. So they framed me. I have been framed because of the Telangana issue, he said, but did not elaborate.        
	Sources said Tiwari, who was largely ignored by senior Uttarakhand partymen, has sought an appointment with Sonia Gandhi to clarify his stand.        
	When his convoy of four cars reached the bungalow around 8pm, he stood in front of the house with the help of his securitymen, twice stumbling despite the support. His associates explained that Tiwari suffered from age-related knee problems, the kind that former Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee is afflicted with.         
	The veteran leader, once part of Sanjay Gandhis coterie, repeatedly drew attention to his old age and infirmity to prove his innocence. Look at me, I am 86. My age disproves the wild allegations being spread. With your love, I can just manage to live a few more years, he said.         
	The scandal erupted on Friday after Telugu television channel ABN Andhra Jyothi aired a footage captured in a sting operation and telecast a purported phone conversation with a woman who claimed to have helped send women from Delhi and other places to work in the Raj Bhavan at Hyderabad. The telecast was stopped following a court injunction that is still in place.        
	Doctors said age had nothing to do with sexual satisfaction.         
	Sex has no expiry date. At least five to six patients in the 85-90 age group visit me each year at KEM Hospital for consultation pertaining to their sexual performance or pleasure related queries. One can perform till the last day of ones life provided the person is in good physical health and does not have psychogenic blocking, said Dr Prakash Kothari, head of the department of sexual medicine at Mumbais KEM Hospital, the only such department in the country.        
	A person can definitely remain sexually active even in his eighties, though with less vigour, said physician Subrata Maitra.         
	Psychiatrist J.R. Ram pointed out that sexuality in old age is a taboo subject in India. Reality is even in old age people have sexual urges and need for physical intimacy, he said.        
	Congress sources said similar rumours about the leader have been abound ever since his wife Dr Sheila Tiwari, a superintendent of a hospital, died in the late-eighties from an accident. Close associates said Tiwari, who has been living alone thereafter, has learnt to live with such insinuations.         
	He is a shrewd politician and will make a come back soon, said Pramod Singh, a Congress leader in Dehra Dun.         
	New charges        
	A section of NGOs in Uttarakhand led by the Rural Litigation Entitlement Kendra said they plan to file a high court petition against Tiwari for showing extra favours in distributing land and money.         
	It is an open secret that some individual women and business groups got land in Pantnagar, Sitarganj and Hardwar industrial estates at throwaway prices during his rule, said Awdhesh Kaushal, chief of the centre.        
	Tiwari was the first Congress chief minister of Uttarakhand and remained in power from 2002 till 2007 when he was ousted following a humiliating electoral defeat.

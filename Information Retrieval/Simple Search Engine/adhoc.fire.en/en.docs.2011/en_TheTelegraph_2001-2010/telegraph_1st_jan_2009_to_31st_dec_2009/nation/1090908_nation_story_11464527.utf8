The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | 39-stab mom goes on trial for killing kids
                                                                                                               39-stab mom goes on trial for killing kids
          AMIT ROY                          Davina and (right) Jasmine                                  
	London, Sept. 7: Mother, especially for Indians, is supposed to be the most beautiful word in the language. And yet, in a terrible murder trial that began today in Britain, an Indian mother stands accused of repeatedly stabbing her two teenage daughters to death.        
	In other cases that have occurred in the UK over the years, it has usually been the Indian husband who has killed his children, perhaps to get back at a wife who was threatening to leave for another man.        
	This time it is the other way round.        
	Rekha Kumari-Baker is on trial charged with murdering her daughters, Davina, 16, and Jasmine, 13.        
	Davina was stabbed 39 times in a frenzied attack, Cambridge Crown Court heard. The younger girl was stabbed in similar fashion with a knife that their mother had bought from an Asda supermarket in Cambridge.        
	One theory, according to prosecuting barrister John Farmer, was that Rekha, a 41-year-old hotel worker, wanted to wreak havoc on her former husband, David Baker, 45, an IT worker.        
	 There was much contention between the defendant and her ex-husband over the care and custody of their children.        
	It is understood that the couple have been divorced for five years and that Rekha was not successful with a new relationship.        
	Even in a country used to extreme levels of violence in murder trials that come to court, this is an exceptionally harrowing case. It is alleged that the mother postponed the murder by a day because one of the girls thanked her for taking them out on a shopping trip.        
	Farmer told the jury of five men and seven women that Rekha bought the knife shortly before 6pm on June 11, 2007. The evidence suggested she intended to kill the girls that night.        
	The mother had taken the girls to the Lakeside shopping centre near Thurrock, Essex, in an attempt to soften up the teenagers and ensure that they slept at her home in Stretham, Cambridgeshire, and be available to be killed.        
	But she did not kill her daughters that night because she was taken by surprise when Davina sent her a text message expressing appreciation for the shopping trip. So Rekha arranged another outing to Lakeside the next day.        
	She had woken at about 2.30am on June 13 and crept in her nightgown into the girls bedrooms. Farmer said she attacked Davina first, stabbing her elder daughter 39 times. The teenager had attempted to resist but it was to no avail.        
	The word frenzied may be appropriate once she had started to stab, commented Farmer. Once she started she was going to finish.        
	 Rekha continued stabbing until she was sure Davina was dead. She then slipped into Jasmines bedroom and did the same thing, leaving the younger girl who stirred but did not resist to the same degree, with an awful lot of wounds.         
	After killing the girls Rekha dressed, got into her car and drove towards nearby Ely.        
	She returned home, showered and cleaned herself up, took 20 to pay for petrol, and went out in her car again.        
	Just before 6.30am Rekha telephoned a friend, special police constable Natalie Barford, and left a message: Ive done something terrible, Natalie. Please call me.         
	Later, she told her friend: I have killed the kids, the children are dead.        
	In another phone call, she is alleged to have said: I stabbed them with knives from the kitchen. This is terrible. At least the children are safe now. Nobody else can hurt them.        
	In an interview with the police, the defendant denied making such confessions and said that at that stage she had not realised the girls were dead.        
	Rekha, who denies murder, was arrested after Barford visited her home.        
	Rekha told the police she had intended to take her own life but there was no evidence she had made a suicide attempt, Farmer continued.         
	Rekhas legal counsel would say that she was suffering from a severe abnormality of mind when she killed the girls and would press for diminished responsibility.        
	The prosecutions case, said Farmer, was that Rekha was guilty of murder but if jurors accepted defence arguments she would be convicted of the lesser charge of manslaughter.

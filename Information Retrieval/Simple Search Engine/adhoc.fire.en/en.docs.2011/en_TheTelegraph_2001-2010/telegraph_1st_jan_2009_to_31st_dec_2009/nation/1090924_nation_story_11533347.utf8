The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitish nepotism war on
                                                                                                               Nitish nepotism war on
          NALIN VERMA                          Nitish Kumar offers tribute to Ramdhari Singh Dinkar on his birth anniversary in Patna on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	Patna, Sept. 23: Unruffled by JD(U)s recent defeat, chief minister Nitish Kumar today said that his partys war on nepotism was on and that action would be taken against leaders who fielded their family in the bypolls.        
	Voters are fed up with the culture that promotes the wife or the brother-in-law. They are the ones who voted the JD(U) to power in 2005, said Nitish Kumar in an exclusive interview with The Telegraph, making an oblique reference to RJD boss Lalu Prasad.        
	There is no question of tolerating leaders who choose to go against party principle, Nitish said.        
	JD(U) lost the Ghosi seat on which party MP Jaddish Sharma fielded wife Shanti Devi as an Independent against official nominee. Shanti won. Similarly, Begusarai MP Monazir Hasan worked against the party in Munger after Nitishs refusal to grant a ticket to Hasans man. The RJD won that seat.        
	Unfazed by the defeat, the chief minister refused to adhere to the Oppositions description of the bypoll as the semi-final. Instead, he referred to the it as a practice match, the Lok Sabha polls as the semi-final and the 2010 Assembly polls as the final battle.        
	The RJD-LJP combination won nine of the 18 seats in the practice match, but he (Lalu Prasad) is giving an impression that his party captured power, he said.        
	People voted keeping in mind local factors as they knew that the outcome would not affect the government. The scenario will be different during the 2010 Assembly polls.         
	On the bataidari bill that is believed to have turned the tide and land-owning castes against the JD(U) and the government, Nitish said: There is no proposal pending with the government for amending the bataidari rule. The opposition created confusion through false propaganda.        
	He clarified that the D. Bandopadhyay Commission had given its report on land reforms to the government that handed it over to a committee for examination. The state will turn its attention on the issue only after the committee submits its report.         
	The Bandopadhyay Commission allegedly has dwelt at length on the issue of ceiling, bhudan and government land that deserve attention.        
	Nitish admitted that the LJP-RJD got the upper hand in this poll because Congress fielded candidates on all 18 seats. In the final battle, voters will have a choice between bringing anarchy back or keep a dispensation that has been serving them by building roads, hospitals, schools and controlling crime.         
	The chief minister said his policy of nyay ke saath vikas (development with justice) is slated to get rigorous and that his policy of promoting EBCs, Mahadalits and Pasmada Muslims would continue.        
	JD(U)s door is open for all workers and leaders who have faith in it. The setback will not lead us to shut our doors to people from other parties, he stressed.         
	I am sure that people have not forgotten the kidnappings, the crimes, the bad roads and lack of schools and colleges in the state for 15 years. Tell me who will like to go back to the lantern age, asked the chief minister with a smile. Incidentally, the lantern is also RJDs symbol.

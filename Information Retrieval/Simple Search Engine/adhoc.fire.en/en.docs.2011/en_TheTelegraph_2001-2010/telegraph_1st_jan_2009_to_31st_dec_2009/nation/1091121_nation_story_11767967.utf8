          ANANYA SENGUPTA                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 20: Delhi High Court today censured the state government for granting parole to Manu Sharma, who is serving life sentence for the murder of model Jessica Lal, saying he got the relief because he was influential.        
	Justice Kailash Gambhir said the government had not followed its policy  that prisoners who had appealed their sentences werent eligible for parole  in Sharmas case. The lifer is the son of a Congress leader from Haryana.        
	Gambhir said Sharmas parole plea was cleared within 20 days, while it took the government three to six months in the normal course.        
	 The list (regarding number of parole applications) depicts a dismal picture showing the government is giving least priority to parole applications of (other) convicts. No doubt the home department has given selective treatment to some convicts because of their high connections, Gambhir said, alluding to the Sharmas political clout.        
	The court was hearing a petition filed by Sumeer Singh, one of the 10 policemen convicted in the 1997 shooting of two businessmen in the capitals Connaught Place. He sought parole for three months to file an appeal in the Supreme Court against his conviction.         
	At the last hearing on November 10, the court had asked the Delhi governments home secretary to appear before it and explain the delay in dealing with parole applications despite clear directives.         
	 Already, this court has given directions that the parole applications moved by convicts be given due priority and the same be decided within 10 days. It appears that the directions given by this court are being implemented more in violations than in compliance, the court had said.         
	The high court had also directed the government to file a list of applications received this year.         
	Today, the government filed an affidavit saying it had 372 parole applications till November 18. Of these, 72 requests were accepted, 202 declined and 98 were pending. Fourteen convicts jumped parole this year and were absconding.         
	The government also submitted a draft for new parole guidelines.

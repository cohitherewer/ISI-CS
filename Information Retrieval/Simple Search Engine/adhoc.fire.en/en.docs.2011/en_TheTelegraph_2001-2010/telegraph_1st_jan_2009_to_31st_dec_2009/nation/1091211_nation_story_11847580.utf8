          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Visually challenged people take out a protest rally in Bhubaneswar on Thursday. (PTI)                                   
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 10: Outraged over the alleged rape of a 20-year-old visually challenged girl, hundreds today took out a rally under the aegis of teh Orissa Association for the Blind demanding more security for themselves, especially women.        
	The association has urged chief minister Naveen Patnaik to provide the victim with social security by giving her a job. This is a shame for all of us including the government and the police. The girl hails from a very poor family of Balikuda block in Jagatsinghpur district. What she has lost cannot be compensated but the government must make arrangements for her social security, said Sanyas Behera, the general secretary of the association.         
	Last Thursday, a taxi driver, Bikash Behera, allegedly raped the girl near Bhubaneswar railway station.         
	The girl, a student of Utkal Singeet Mahavidyalaya, had boarded a train to Bhubaneswar and was waiting for her friend at the station. The friend had not turned up, and the girl asked Behera to read out her telephone number from a diary. Behera made a fake call from his phone and told her that her friend was waiting for her a little distance away. He took her to an isolated building near the station where he allegedly raped her.         
	A few locals who had seen the accused with the blind girl, helped the police identify him. The accused has been booked under Section 376 of IPC, said a Mahila police station officer.        
	Chairperson of the State Commission for Women Jyoti Panigrahi has assured of early submission of chargesheet in this case.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PM to be Bastille chief guest
                                                                                                               PM to be Bastille chief guest
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, June 8: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is likely to be the chief guest at the July 14 Bastille Day celebrations in Paris this year.         
	Reliable sources said today a short visit to France was being worked into the Prime Ministers scheduled trip to Egypt to attend the Non-Aligned Summit in mid-July.         
	They said that although a reciprocal invitation from France was pending following President Nicolas Sarkozys visit last year, Singh was initially not keen on going essentially because of the budget session of Parliament.         
	However, the French were apparently very keen and insistent; besides, being chief guest at the Bastille Day parade carries its own prestige and historicity.         
	Bastille Day, also celebrated as the French National Day, is observed in memory of the 1789 storming of the Bastille Prison by the Paris citizenry, an event that led to the creation of the French republic. The occasion is marked by an elaborate military parade in Paris, quite like the Republic Day ensemble in Delhi.         
	For the past few years, the French have also set a tradition of inviting ceremonial military units from friendly nations to lead the parade, which passes down the Champs Elysees from Arc de Triomphe to Place de la Concorde where the French President and other dignitaries stand.         
	This year, it may well be an Indian contingent leading the way in Paris.

                                                                                                               Maya poll axe on IAS officers
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mayavati: Transfer spree                                  
	Lucknow, May 23: Mayavatis transfer spree in Uttar Pradesh shows no signs of abating: after IPS officers and chairpersons of corporations, she has pulled off a midnight shunt-out of 10 IAS officers.        
	Sources said the chief minister was displeased after a poll debacle review showed that the UPAs rural job scheme had mobilised voters in favour of the Congress but schemes begun by her regime had made little or no progress.        
	These officers were from places the Congress had won, including Rae Bareli, Sultanpur and Kanpur. Two of them were Kanpur divisional commissioner Dinesh Singh and Rae Bareli district magistrate Anita C. Meshram.        
	Mayavati was reportedly irked that little headway had been made with state schemes like the Ambedkar rural development programme, Kanshi Ram urban housing scheme, rural drinking water project and the scholarship programmes for the poor. She felt this had made voters apathetic towards the Bahujan Samaj Party.        
	In contrast, the Centres rural job scheme had been rapidly implemented in over 70 per cent of the state, providing the poor jobs for 100 days a year.

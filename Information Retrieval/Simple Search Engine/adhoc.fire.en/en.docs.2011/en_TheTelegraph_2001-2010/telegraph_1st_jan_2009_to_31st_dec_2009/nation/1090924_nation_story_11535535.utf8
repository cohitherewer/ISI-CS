	Kathmandu, Sept. 23 (Agencies): Three skydivers, including an Indian Air Force officer, claim to have made the highest parachute landing high in the Himalayas of Nepal, officials said today.        
	Air Commodore Ramesh Chandra Tripathi, 45, and British nationals Leo Dickinson, 62, and Ralph Mitchell, 24, jumped from 20,000ft on Tuesday and landed on Gorakshep, a frozen lake bed at 16,940ft near Mount Everest, said Surendra Sapkota, the chief of Nepals mountaineering department.        
	With a free fall timing of around five to six seconds, all touched the snow of Gorakshep in four minutes. All three have returned to Kathmandu and are physically fit, the organisers said in a statement.        
	It was thrilling and exhilarating to be so close to Everest, said Tripathi, who is a parajump instructor for the Indian Air Force. He climbed Everest in 2005.        
	It offers a totally different challenge in terms of high winds and freezing temperatures.        
	The wind was drifting me away. The chances of falling into crevasses or hitting the ridges and glaciers was high but it is worth fighting against the odds of nature.        
	Dickinson and Mitchell have done over 4,000 jumps, while Tripathi has done over 3,000 jumps.        
	In May this year, Indian Army Colonel Niraj Rana set another record by land- ing above Camp II of Mt Makalu at a height of about 22966ft on a paraglider.        
	This is the highest altitude at which a paraglider has ever landed.        
	Sapkota said officials from his department, police and the home ministry escorted the skydivers to the area and witnessed the jump on Tuesday. They were still trying to confirm whether it was the highest landing on record.        
	Dickinson told reporters in Kathmandu that after he jumped, he got a glimpse of Mount Everest before opening his parachute and saw a panorama of fantastic mountains.        
	The divers were in free fall for about 5 seconds before opening their parachutes and gliding down to the landing zone.         
	The feat comes only one year after the previous world record was set in the same area when Nepal first started allowing skydiving in the high altitudes around Mount Everest.        
	The previous record was also in the shadow of Mount Everest at a drop zone of 12,350ft.        
	Sapkota said the government started allowing skydiving because it would add to the list of adventures Nepal had to offer. The landlocked mountain nation plans to celebrate Visit Nepal Year in 2011 to attract more tourists.        
	Tourism is one of the Nepals biggest foreign currency earners with tens of thousands of visitors coming to trek in the Himalayas every year.

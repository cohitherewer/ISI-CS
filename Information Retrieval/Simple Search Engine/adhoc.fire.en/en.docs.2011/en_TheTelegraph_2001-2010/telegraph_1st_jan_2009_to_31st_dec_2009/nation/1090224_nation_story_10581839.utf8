          LALMOHAN PATNAIK                          Police stations turn into metal graveyards                                  
	Cuttack, Feb. 23: The police commissionerate has decided to auction seized vehicles lying at various police stations, as the unclaimed cars have become a headache.        
	The vehicles to be auctioned are the ones not claimed. These were either stolen, left behind or may have been involved in accidents. At police stations across the city they are dumped inside the compound exposed to vagaries of nature due to shortage of space.        
	In the first phase, the commissionerate decided to auction 184 unclaimed vehicles. The process for the auction has already started, Cuttack deputy commissioner of police A.N. Sinha said.        
	A joint committee of the police and transport officials would decide on the final price for auction after the motor vehicle inspector completes the valuation process.        
	Some of the impounded vehicles are suspected to be bearing fake and tampered registration, engine and chassis numbers.        
	As part of the verification process, clarifications have been sought from the transport office on the impounded vehicles, mostly two-wheelers on the basis of registration, engine and chassis numbers.        
	A senior police officer said those vehicles having fake registration would be registered by the MVI at government expenses.         
	The auction had been initiated under clause 62 (1) of Chapter VIII of the Orissa Urban Police Act, 2003, and the proceeds thereof would be credited to the government.        
	In Cuttack, there are 12 police stations and dumped vehicles  bicycles and two-wheelers  are a common sight.         
	In each and every police station, there are, on an average, some 20-30 dumped vehicles, which have been lying for over six months.        
	While more than 35 unclaimed vehicles overcrowd the compound of Madhupatna police station, the situation is no better at Lalbag, Jagatpur, Chauliaganj and Malgodown.         
	Disposal of the vehicles is a headache, said an officer at the Jagatpur police station.

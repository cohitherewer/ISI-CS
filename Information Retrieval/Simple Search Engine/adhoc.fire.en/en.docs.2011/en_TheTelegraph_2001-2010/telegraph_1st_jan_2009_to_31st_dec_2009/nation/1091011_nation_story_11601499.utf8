The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | RSS red-faced over Rahul pat
                                                                                                               RSS red-faced over Rahul pat
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Rahul Gandhi                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 10: RSS publicity wing chief Manmohan Vaidyas oblique endorsement of Rahul Gandhis forays into rural India has embarrassed the organisation.        
	Its an embarrassment we could have done without, said a Sangh source, attending the four-day meeting of the central working committee in Rajgir, Bihar.        
	After a perception gained ground that under new sarsanghachalak Mohanrao Bhagwat the RSS would become overtly political to fulfil its mission of cleaning up the BJP from top to bottom, the Sangh has been at pains to correct the impression.        
	At every available forum, its leaders have claimed it remains a social and cultural organisation, wedded to a nationalistic vision. Politics was not its cup of tea, they emphasised. They even said the RSS headed a family with more than 60 progenies of which the BJP was just one.         
	Sources said it was regrettable that while the BJP and to an extent the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, had grabbed the medias eyeballs, organisations such as the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, the Seva Bharati and the Vanavasi Kalyan Ashram were doing the parent much prouder because of the silent dedication with which they worked under trying circumstances.         
	Vaidyas certificate to Rahul made it seem as though the RSS was out to play political favourites between the Congress and the BJP.         
	On Friday at Rajgir, Vaidya, replying to a question from a journalist on what he thought of Rahuls pro-rural thinking and if the BJP was justified in criticising it, was quoted by agencies as saying: Every Indian should visit villages and talk about it. It is a good thing, there is nothing wrong with it.        
	The BJP had a week ago advised Rahul to tell his mummy and the Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, to rein in food prices before visiting villages because the rural poor were the hardest hit.        
	Sangh sources said that although there was intrinsically nothing objectionable in what Vaidya had said, his statement, when juxtaposed with the BJPs response, made it seem as though the RSS was batting for Rahul while the BJP attacked him.         
	Just when we are trying to foster a non-political programme, its unfortunate we have got enmeshed in a controversy like this. Our aim is to make the village the nucleus of development and help it become self-reliant so that migration is contained. Development should be re-defined to make it village-centric, a source said.        
	The source said the RSSs rural philosophy incorporated the ideals of Gandhi, Ram Manohar Lohia and Deen Dayal Upadhyaya, all of whom were either anathema or irrelevant to the Congress. Lohia had always been strongly anti-Congress. The Congress has dumped Gandhi. It always hated Upadhyaya (a Jan Sangh founder of RSS origin), so how can we be told to back the Congress? the source asked.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, June 30: Officials of Board of Secondary Education in Orissa today held the new student-friendly syllabus responsible for the record 10.27 per cent rise in the pass rate in High School Certificate (HSC) Examination-2009.         
	The pass percentage went up after a 5.95 per cent fall last year and officials singled out the new syllabus that eliminated two optional papers and one practical paper, as the main cause.         
	Declaring the results, BSE president Dharanidhar Nath said: The success rate among regular candidates was 63.41 per cent (65.42 per cent among boys and 61.26 per cent among girls) as against 53.14 per cent last year. The pass rate was 59.09 in 2007, 56.40 in 2006 and 55.66 per cent in 2005.         
	While 265 schools have registered 100 per cent pass rate the number of schools with zero success rate have gone down to 65 from 73 last year, he said.        
	Optional papers, reintroduced under a new syllabus for students who appeared the HSC-2008, were withdrawn after the pass percentage plummeted in 2008 for the first time in four years.         
	Instead the BSE stuck to English and third language subjects of 100 marks each, mathematics in two papers totalling to 100, history and social science for 100 and science 100, bringing down the total aggregate from 800 to 600 marks.        
	Curriculum seems to have brought rich dividends, said Nihar Ranjan Mohapatra, the BSE secretary.        
	Bibek Bishal Mehena of Sarawati Vidyamandir (Rourkela) and Sanket Dash of Saraswati Sishu Bidyamandir (Ramaharinagar-Ganjam) both secured 95.6 per cent marks and topped the HSC-2009 exam. As many as 28 students have been ranked in the top 10, 13 of them are from Saraswati Vidyamandirs. According to the result released by the BSE: 3,36,090 students of 7,499 schools appeared for the tests in the regular category from 1,722 centres. Of them, 211,717 had passed (43,399 in the first division, 71,942 in the second division and 96,376 in the third division). The pass rate among SC and ST was 53.47 per cent and 49.80 per cent, respectively, while general category students notched 68.13 per cent pass rate.        
	While Dhenkanal (80.12 per cent) came up with highest success rate, Nawapara and Balasore followed with 78.29 per cent and 75.12 per cent, respectively. Kandhamal district registered the lowest at 43.51 per cent.

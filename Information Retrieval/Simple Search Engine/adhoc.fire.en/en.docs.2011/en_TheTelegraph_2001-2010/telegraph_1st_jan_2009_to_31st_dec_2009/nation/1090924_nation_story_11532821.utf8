          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 23: The states women might miss the fun of mehndi this Puja following the governments directive asking women to abstain from applying mehndi.        
	Directive came from the heath department after Sundays incident in which hundreds of Muslim women fell sick after using henna during Id.        
	Cracking a whip on mehndi sellers, health minister Prasanna Acharya has pressed drugs control authorities to collect spurious mehndi available to prevent further damages.         
	Bhadrak, Balasore, Padampur, Sambalpur, Khurda and Bhubaneswar drug inspectors today swung into action, raiding shops and collecting samples. It was found that two brands, Dulhan Purohit and Mila, caused the reaction.        
	The department also made it clear that there are no licensed mehndi manufacturers in Orissa         
	We have found out that no license has been issued to any mehndi manufacturer and we suspect that the product must have reached from the outside, Acharya said.        
	Meanwhile, samples of spurious mehndi have been collected from the affected regions and sent for tests. We have sent the samples to the Calcutta-based Central Laboratory for tests, said Hrushikesh Mohapatra, the deputy drugs controller.

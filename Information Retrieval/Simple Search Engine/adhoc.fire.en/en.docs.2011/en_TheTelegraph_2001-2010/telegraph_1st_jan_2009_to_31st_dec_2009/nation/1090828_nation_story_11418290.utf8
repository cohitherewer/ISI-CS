The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mayhem on Bihar tracks
                                                                                                               Mayhem on Bihar tracks
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, Aug. 27: Whether under Mamata Banerjee, Lalu Prasad or Nitish Kumar, train tracks passing between Lakhisarai and Buxar (200km) and between Patna and Gaya (85km) are prime targets of Maoists and mobs in Bihar.        
	The tracks described as the nations lifeline is considered very unsafe. A train journey is a dangerous affair in Bihar, said Deepak Sinha, a Delhi-based marketing professional who works at Patna and travels between Patna and New Delhi.        
	A case in point: on Tuesday, Maoists attacked Ismailpur station falling on the Gaya-Mughalsarai stretch. Rebels abducted station manager and railway staff, before vandalising the station.         
	On August 18, a group of students travelling without tickets got on an air-conditioned coach of Shramjivi Express at Arra and raised a ruckus when RPF personnel questioned their presence. They burnt four bogies of the Delhi-Patna train at Bihta, forcing petrified passengers to get down, baggage in tow, and flee while security forces watched mutely. This lone incident caused a loss of Rs 3.5 crore to the railways.        
	Railways is often a soft target for any form of protest in Bihar. Students ransacked Lakhisarai railway station and beat up its staff following the murder of one Sudhir Saxena who ran a coaching institute at Lakhisarai. Another group burnt six coaches of a Bhagalpur-Delhi Express at Barh between Patna and Lakhisarai in October 2008 and vandalised stations to protest the death of a Patna student, Rahul Raj, at Mumbai and attack on migrants from Bihar in Maharashtra.         
	Thus, arson is a routine on Lakhisarai, Patna, Buxar and Mughalsari sections and the Patna-Gaya section of the East Central Railway.         
	Deputy inspector-general (railways Patna) Arbind Pandey told The Telegraph that it was sheer stupidity that led to mobs behaving irresponsibly. Indian Railways is a national property and elements who target it must be dealt with strongly. Attacks on railways that pass through Bihar earns the state a bad name. Railway minister Mamata Baerjee, too, has concurred the problem and written to union home ministry and state government to deploy additional armed forces on long-distance trains between Lakhisarai and Buxar stations. But, the trouble runs deep. Some railway and GRP authorities, on condition of anonymity, state that prior to Mamata Banerjee the railways for 10 years were in the hands of ministers from Bihar  Lalu Prasad, Nitish Kumar and Ram Vilas Paswan.        
	During JP movement cadre would launch attacks on Indian Railways as it was the most visible public property and attracted maximum attention, said a senior railway officer, adding: Political rivalry still spills over on to the tracks in Bihar.        
	A senior railway officer and a Buxar citizen, Mahendra Ojha, believes that more trains and special coaches for locals in long-distance trains should mitigate problems to some extent. There is also a strong feeling among railway staff that Mamata Banerjee is not devoting time to the issue of railway security.         
	The minister should co-ordinate with Bihar to check recurring violence, said Anil Pathak, a senior JD(U) leader.

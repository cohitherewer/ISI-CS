The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Metro Man returns, so does mishap   Eye on safety outsource
                                                                                                               Metro Man returns, so does mishap
   Eye on safety outsource

	New Delhi, July 13: Delhi Metro witnessed its second accident in two days when a crane collapse injured five labourers at yesterdays tragedy site, prompting urban planners to question its practice of outsourcing safety issues to its contractors.        
	Embarrassingly for Metro chief E. Sreedharan, the mishap happened minutes after he had inspected the site, having earlier let himself be persuaded by the Delhi government to withdraw his resignation.        
	Several cranes were clearing the debris from yesterdays bridge collapse, which killed six people and prompted Sreedharans dramatic resignation, when the boom of a crane came crashing down, dragging with it three other cranes. One of them, a 16-wheeled vehicle, fell on a row of shops that had earlier been evacuated. Five workers suffered minor injuries.        
	The back-to-back accidents raised stark questions about the Metros efficiency, safety practices, accountability norms  even its arrogance  but principally about its dependence on contractors and subcontractors.        
	The basic problem is, the responsibility of maintaining safety norms at the site is entrusted to the very contractor who is building the project. There is obviously a clash of interests, said Himanshu Thakkar, an expert on urban development.        
	Dunnu Roy, director of the NGO, Hazards Centre, said that on each site, there should be a safety engineer for daily inspection.        
	This guy should be a specialist and not in any way answerable to the contractor. But in this contractual process, the task of maintaining safety is entrusted to the contractor himself, Roy said. A contractor will never say stop work, hell say lets take the risk to save money and time.        
	He said the problem started when the Metro began giving contracts to private companies. A private-public partnership means spend less, hire fewer men, but do as much or more work.        
	Another problem is that such an arrangement means there is no one to take responsibility, said P.K. Sarkar, head (transport), School of Planning and Architecture.        
	When an accident happens, the Metro shifts the blame to the contractor, who blames an executive and sacks him, he added. After a Metro bridge collapse had killed two persons last October, contractor Afcons Infrastructure had sacked two executives.        
	The chain of command is difficult to establish. Who do you blame? Sarkar said.        
	The experts are also shocked that the Metro had chosen to repair the cracked pillar that caused yesterdays tragedy, and not to rebuild it.        
	Sources said Sreedharan had recommended that the pillar be redone only to be vetoed by the Metros technical committee, who assured him there was no grave risk.        
	It just shows the contractors and the corporation were in a tearing rush and also perhaps low on manpower, Sarkar said.        
	A CAG report, lying with the Union urban development ministry, accuses the Metro of scaling down testing requirements and testing in non-accredited labs, and questioned its quality control.        
	The government today said all precautions would be taken to prevent accidents. Well never compromise on safety, urban development minister Jaipal Reddy said.

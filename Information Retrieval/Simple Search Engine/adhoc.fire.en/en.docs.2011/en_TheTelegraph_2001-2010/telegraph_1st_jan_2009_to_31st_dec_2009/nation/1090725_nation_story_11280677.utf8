The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Fear of BJP critics being left out of meet 
                                                                                                               Fear of BJP critics being left out of meet 
          SANJAY K. JHA                            (Top) Arun Shourie, Yashwant Sinha                                 
	New Delhi, July 24: The upcoming selection of delegates to the BJPs much-awaited chintan baithak has become contentious, with many fearing that a possible omission of dissidents would rob the poll post-mortem of credibility.        
	Although the party is yet to fix the criteria for choosing the participants, leaders at various levels are debating the chances of rebels such as Yashwant Sinha, Jaswant Singh and Arun Shourie receiving invites.        
	Sources said the high command did not want a huge gathering at the August 17-19 brainstorming session in Mumbai, called to analyse the reasons for the election defeat, and that the number of participants might be restricted to 40 or less.        
	This means not all senior leaders can be accommodated, and those at the helm are believed to be trying to keep out the leading dissenters.        
	Yashwant, Jaswant and Shourie have been raising questions  through letters, articles and interventions at party forums  about the partys failure to hold its poll managers accountable for the defeat. All three are former Union ministers.        
	Jaswant and Shourie had spoken up at the BJP national executive, where party president Rajnath Singh promised a thorough discussion at the baithak. Shourie later raised a storm by writing a series of articles on the BJPs leadership crisis.        
	Many in the party are dismissing the possibility of the dissidents presence at the baithak, asking under what criteria can they be invited.        
	All former ministers cannot be invited since that would raise the number of delegates to around 100. The list must, after all, include the important office-bearers, those involved in the election process, the observers sent to the states to collect reports, the chief ministers and a few Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh representatives too.        
	The sources said the chances of Yashwant and Shourie appear bleak since they do not hold any party post but Jaswant, who too is not an office-bearer, may be included since the high command does not view him as a rebel. The chances of suspects like Maneka Gandhi and Vinay Katiyar too are slim.        
	Some, though, want adequate representation of all viewpoints to ensure the post-mortem is not reduced to a hollow ritual. They cite how Rajnath had recently called Yashwant and assured him the party would use his services suitably.

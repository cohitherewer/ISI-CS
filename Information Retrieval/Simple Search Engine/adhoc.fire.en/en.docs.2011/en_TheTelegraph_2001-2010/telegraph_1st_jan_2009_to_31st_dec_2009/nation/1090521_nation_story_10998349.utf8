Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, who attended her first UPA meeting, and Congress leaders AK Antony and Pranab Mukherjee are also seen in the picture.                                                  
	New Delhi, May 20: Rahul Gandhi today came a step closer to becoming a part of the UPA and the Congresss core strategy group.        
	Apart from Ahmed Patel, Sonia Gandhis political secretary, Rahul was the only party functionary to be invited to a meeting of the UPA and Congress leaders this morning at Sonias residence. He was part of a charmed circle that had Manmohan Singh, Pranab Mukherjee, A.K. Antony and P. Chidambaram.        
	The others who attended the meeting included Mamata Banerjee of the Trinamul Congress, M. Karunanidhi and Dayanidhi Maran of the DMK, Sharad Pawar and Praful Patel of the Nationalist Congress Party, and Farooq Abdullah of the National Conference.        
	Sources said Rahul would almost certainly be part of a co-ordination mechanism that Sonia, the UPA chairperson, is expected to set up shortly.        
	The committee has been mandated to revisit the common minimum programme (CMP) that was written jointly by the Congress and the Left in 2004 as a guidebook for the government.        
	The committee will also go through the manifestos of the Congress and the UPA constituents, cull out the common features, study them and see what can be incorporated in the CMP without bringing out a new edition.         
	Sources said the revised CMP was likely to bear Rahuls stamp.                  Rahul, seen with All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen leader Asaduddin Owaisi, also took part in a UPA meeting for the first time.

	 His concept of marrying growth with equity and seeing the two as complementary and not contradictory could be the underpinning of some of the new features of the CMP, a source said.        
	Rahul did not speak in the meeting but is supposed to have listened intently to Mamata and Karunanidhi.         
	DMK chief Karunanidhi spoke largely about infrastructure revamp. He conveyed to the Prime Minister and Sonia that he preferred the infrastructure-related ministries.         
	Mamatas focus was on programmes for Dalits and minorities and on creating more efficient mechanisms for delivering the benefits of the Centres 15-point programme for the minorities.        
	Sources believe that after being inducted into the proposed UPA-Congress committee, Rahuls entry into the Congresss core group is almost sure.        
	The Congresss core group, or the Friday Club as it was called, met every week to go through the events, developments and strategies and sometimes suggested mid-stream corrections in the governments working.        
	Apart from Singh and Sonia, the other members were Patel, Mukherjee, Shivraj Patil (when he was home minister), Antony and Arjun Singh.        
	Chidambaram has now replaced Patil.        
	Arjun is unlikely to find a place in it because sources maintained he was virtually out of the cabinet.         
	Although Rahul was not likely to join the government  unless the Prime Minister and Sonia pressure him a lot, a source said  he was expected to be a member of the elitist Friday Club.        
	Arjun, who was the human resource development minister, did not attend the first core group meeting after the election results were declared. He was apparently not invited.

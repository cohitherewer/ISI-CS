          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, Dec. 5: Students and pro-Telengana activists ransacked malls and rampaged through the streets of the Andhra capital as the agitation for a separate state turned violent today, fed by rumours that the condition of their fasting spearhead had turned critical.        
	Doctors at Hyderabads NIMS, however, told reporters this evening that K. Chandrasekhar Rao was out of danger and the Telengana Rashtra Samiti chief had been shifted to ICU for precaution.        
	Hours before, the TRS boss, on hunger strike since last week, had declared from his hospital bed that he would die for the cause of Telengana rather than break his fast.        
	Late tonight, Andhras Congress chief minister, K. Rosaiah, told a news conference he would talk to Rao only if the TRS boss gave up his fast.         
	I apprised Sonia Gandhi and the Prime Minister of the situation during my visit to Delhi (last week). They said they were trying to club it (the issue) with similar demands (for creation of new states), Rosaiah said. The issue, he added, has to be decided at the national level.        
	Police said students from Osmania University swarmed into Hyderabads business centres of Ameerpet and Punjagutta and started attacking shops and malls, targeting establishments owned by non-Telengana entrepreneurs.        
	Among those targeted were popular haunts like Hyderabad Central, Chandana Bros, RK Electronics and Big Bazaar. The protesters destroyed some 30 buses in the city as the agitation turned violent after six days of strikes and demonstrations.         
	Todays violence, on the eve of a 48-hour bandh call for a Telengana state, spread beyond Hyderabad to adjoining districts like Nalgonda and Medak, where protesters attacked a government office. The police have imposed curfew in Hyderabad and Nalgonda.        
	In Nizamabad district, 150km from Hyderabad, agitators burnt an effigy of Sonia. The violence came even as Congress ministers and Telengana MLAs wrote to the party chief to intervene.

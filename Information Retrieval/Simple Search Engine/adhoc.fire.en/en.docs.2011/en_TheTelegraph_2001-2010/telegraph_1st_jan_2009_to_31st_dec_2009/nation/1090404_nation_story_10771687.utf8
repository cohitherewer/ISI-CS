                                                                                                               National park faces red wrath
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, April 3: Maoist strikes continue unabated at the Simlipal national park even as the Mayurbhanj district administration announced it closed for tourists indefinitely.        
	Affirming their stronghold, the Maoists repeated their attack last night after setting afire yet another beat house at Manada range inside the biosphere reserve forest area.        
	The rebels set the beat house on fire after damaging the office furniture and documents. The recent disturbances inside the forest have forced us to close it early this year. We cannot afford to risk the lives of tourists, said field director and conservator R. Nagraj Reddy.        
	The rebels had kicked off with their first terror attack at three forest offices at Barahakamuda, Dhudruchampa and Chahala on Sunday. Ever since, they have torched guesthouses, forest department establishments and destroyed important office documents, furniture and vehicles in different range offices.         
	On Wednesday, they had blown up a wooden bridge at Gudgudia to disrupt the movement of police.         
	Mayurbhanj district police chief P.S. Ranpise, along with his Keonjhar counterpart Soumendra Priyadarshi and DIG Jashwant Jethwa, conducted a meeting to decide the strategy and design an action plan to contain the continuing mayhem.        
	Polling time        
	Voting will close two hours early in Maoist pockets in Bengals Jhargram and Purulia.        
	The official polling time is 7am to 5pm, but in Bandwan and Binpur in the Jhargram seat, and Joypur, Bagmundi and Balarampur in the Purulia constituency, polling will end at 3pm.

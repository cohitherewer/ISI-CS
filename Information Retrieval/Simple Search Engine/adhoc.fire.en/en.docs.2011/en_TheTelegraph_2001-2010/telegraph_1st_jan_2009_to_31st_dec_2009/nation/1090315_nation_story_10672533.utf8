      33 days to go
  *For first day of polls              
	In fray, a Humayun      
	Hyderabad: Chiranjeevi is sticking to his promise of social change.    
	The actor-turned-politician has taken political circles by surprise by announcing Mohammed Humayun, a poor film technician, as the Praja Rajyams candidate from Hyderabads upscale Jubilee Hills.    
	Voters in the newly created seat include some of the wealthiest people in the state who live in posh houses built over plots that cost anything between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 2 lakh a square yard.    
	Humayun, who provided electrical and sound system services for Chiranjeevis public meetings and roadshows, said he didnt have words to express his feelings. I am a very poor technician in the film industry now asked to contest from a rich peoples area, he told reporters.    
	A native of drought-hit Kodanga in the backward Mahbubnagar district but settled in Hyderabad for over 30 years, Humayun has been associated with Chiranjeevi for over two decades.    
	By selecting him, Chiranjeevi has implemented his concept of social change. He has also projected a non-entity in a segment where many high-profile candidates are likely to be in the fray.    
	BSP gain    
	Lucknow: The president of the Samajwadi Partys womens wing resigned on Saturday and joined the BSP after accusing her organisation of discrimination against Brahmins.    
	Ranjana Bajpai, who had been denied a Lok Sabha ticket from Sitapur, said ever since Mulayam Singh Yadav became chief minister of Uttar Pradesh in 1989, he has alienated Brahmins from the political and social mainstream. Therefore, I have resigned from the primary membership of the SP and joined the BSP, which takes all sections of the society along.    
	She also said many senior leaders had left the SP in the recent past because of the power wielded by Amar Singh.     
	Vote battle    
	New Delhi: Retired military personnel are readying themselves for the battle of ballots.     
	We are going to fight the Lok Sabha polls as we have lost faith in present-day political parties which are denying us due pensions, the vice-chairman of the Indian Ex-servicemen Movement, Maj Gen (retired) Satbir Singh, has said.     
	They would try to ensure that the UPA did not return to power as it has ill-treated us by not granting the one-rank-one pension demand, he said.

	Srinagar, Nov. 18: The Jammu and Kashmir government today said work on the Kishenganga hydroelectric power project was under way even as Pakistan has threatened to move the World Bank for arbitration over the project.         
	Work is on at all the three places for the project, Jammu and Kashmir power commissioner B.R. Sharma said today.         
	The plant is being set up at Gurez in Bandipora district of north Kashmir, close to the Line of Control. It is mired in controversies because of Pakistan s objection that it is a violation of the Indus Water Treaty.         
	Work on the project began in 2007 and the government had been silent over the progress.         
	Sharma admitted that the work on the project had started last year. But there was some disruption at two places because of local reasons like employment and rehabilitation, which stands resolved now, he told a news conference in Srinagar.         
	Under the treaty, Pakistan has exclusive right over the Indus, Jhelum and the Chenab while India has rights over the Sutlej, Ravi and the Beas. Kishenganga is a tributary of the Jhelum.         
	Pakistan recently threatened to move the World Bank for arbitration, which is the party in Indo-Pak water disputes under the 1960 Indus Water Treaty. Several rounds of bilateral talks failed to resolve the issue. Last month, India invited Pakistan for talks.         
	Sharma said the project was not a violation of the treaty.         
	We are continuing with our work and we hope to complete the project by 2015 which is the deadline. We had recently visited the site along with the central team to take stock of the situation, he said.         
	Apart from the construction of 77m-high dam, the project involves construction of a series of tunnels.

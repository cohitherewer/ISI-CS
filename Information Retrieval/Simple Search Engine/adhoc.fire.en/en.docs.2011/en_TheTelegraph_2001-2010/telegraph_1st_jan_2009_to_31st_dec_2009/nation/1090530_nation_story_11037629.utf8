          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, May 29: The populist Rs 2 per kg rice scheme, launched by Naveen Patnaik government in August 2008, has of course paid dividends by leading the ruling party to a spectacular success in the recent polls.        
	However, rumours of non-BPL families, even income-tax payers, availing the scheme in backward KBK region (Koraput-Bolangir-Kalahandi) has drawn flak. This apparently prompted the state to contemplate the exclusion of the creamy layer from this scheme.         
	We are thinking of excluding well-off families from the list of beneficiaries, said a senior minister on condition of anonymity. The surplus rice accrued after the exclusion of creamy layer will be distributed among the BPL families which will ensure better food security, he added.         
	But the flip side of the scheme is the coverage of 5.56 lakh families living above the poverty line in the KBK region, being highlighted by the Opposition after the elections.        
	Naveen had launched the rice scheme in August. Sensing that successful implementation of the scheme will give rich political dividend in the coming elections, Naveen had taken it very seriously. He had immediately convened a collectors conference and made the district collectors responsible for the scheme implementation.        
	And the efforts ultimately paid off, despite Opposition Congresss propaganda that the UPA government was providing the lions share of subsidy (Rs 11 per kg) as against BJD governments meagre contribution (Rs 3 per kg).              
	Members of royal families and income tax payers are also entitled to the cheap rice scheme, while lakhs of BPL families are being deprived, alleged Congress Legislature Party leader Bhupinder Singh.        
	The BJD government also finds itself in a tight financial spot, as it has to fulfil its electoral promises. BJD had, in its election manifesto, promised to continue the Rs 2 per kg rice scheme if it came to power once again.        
	The scheme covers about 55.79 lakh BPL families and beneficiaries of Antyoday Anna Yojana and 5.56 lakh families living above poverty line in KBK region. Besides, the cheaper rice is also being supplied to all SC and ST boarders in government-run hostels.         
	According to an official estimate, the state exchequer has to bear a burden of Rs 800 crore per year on this scheme. This has obviously forced the government to prune its beneficiary list by excluding the creamy layer to ease the fiscal burden, said a senior official.

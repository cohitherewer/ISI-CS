          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          NR Narayana Murthy                                  
	Bangalore, Dec. 21: The citys old HAL airport may have just got hope of a new life after a committee of legislators called for fresh thought on reopening it amid allegations that the new aerodrome didnt match international standards.        
	A report by the joint House committee said the old airport, closed to commercial operations now, should be reopened for healthy competition and convenience of the public.        
	The suggestion came with a stinging criticism of the new Bangalore International Airports promoters  a consortium of Siemens Project Ventures, L amp;T India and Unique Zurich Airport, Switzerland  for not showing an iota of concern for the general public.        
	The BIA opened in May 2008 but several legislators said it was not built to international standards, prompting the government to set up the panel in August 2008.        
	The panel of 21 legislators said the BIA was a good domestic airport where international flights are allowed to take off and land but the authorities needed to improve public amenities and the service.        
	The committee quoted a 2008 survey of the Airports Authority of India which said the 18-month-old BIAs peak-hour capacity of 3,600 passengers was already saturated and that its runway capacity would reach saturation by 2011.        
	The BIA delayed plans for a new terminal as the volume of traffic dipped over the past year following the global economic downturn. In December, however, the airport, the third busiest in the country, said it saw passenger traffic of 2.45 million in the quarter ended September, the highest since it opened.        
	The House committee report said decisions at each stage (from project approval to construction) were not in accordance with the expectation of a world class international airport.        
	The panel also mentioned a list of officials, including Infosys Technologies chairman N.R. Narayana Murthy, who were involved in important decisions for initiating appropriate action for the new airport.        
	Murthy was the first chairman of a special purpose vehicle formed in 2001 to oversee the BIA project but resigned in 2005 when former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda questioned his contributions.        
	Committee chairman D. Hemachandra Sagar, however, said Murthys role was limited to co-ordinating with the Centre and the state government and he was only involved in getting the project sanctioned to Bangalore city.        
	The cry against closing the old airport was first heard in March 2008 when NGOs and industrialists staged protests on Bangalores roads. Two petitions are pending before the high court.

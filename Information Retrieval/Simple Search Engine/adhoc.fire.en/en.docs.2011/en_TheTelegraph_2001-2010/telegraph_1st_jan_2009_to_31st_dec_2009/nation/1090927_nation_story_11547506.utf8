                                                                                                               Entally fire glare on hazardous godowns 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 26: A fire raged for more than an hour and a half in a godown in the heart of Calcutta and threatened to spread wide, raising questions about safety measures in unregulated units in the middle of densely populated areas in the city.        
	The godown in Entally was crammed with furniture and spare parts meant for repairing air conditioners. The fire is suspected to have been caused by an electric spark.        
	Twenty fire tenders took over 90 minutes to control the blaze that at one point appeared to leap out of the boundary wall and spread towards rows of shanties outside the building in Radhanath Chowdhury Lane.        
	No one was injured as the godown was closed. Fire officials said the company  Flexi Seating System  had no arrangements to fight fire.        
	The godown is spread over 2,000sqft. At a gap of 5ft, there was another godown. If we had not rushed in a battery of fire tenders, it could have been a disaster. Well lodge a case against the owner, said Uday Adhikari, the divisional fire officer.        
	The premises where the godowns are located belonged to a paint manufacturing company earlier. Since its closure, different individuals bought the godowns and started operating on their own. Officials claimed none of them followed fire protection laws.        
	The fire was possibly triggered by a sudden surge of electrical voltage around 1.10pm, resulting in the spark. With the cubicles cramped with inflammable articles, the fire spread fast, said a fire officer.        
	Residents in the neighbourhood alleged that neither the police  the Entally police station is a stones throw from the godown area  nor the fire department ever bothered to visit the godowns.        
	Todays fire is just an indicator and this will continue to happen. No one bothered to find out how these small companies were operating from these godowns, said Mohammed Asif, a resident.

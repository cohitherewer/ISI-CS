The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Merger murmur on NCP table
                                                                                                               Merger murmur on NCP table
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, June 12: Rattled by reduced Lok Sabha seats and stung by controversy, the Nationalist Congress Party leadership is meeting to reassess the partys future amid calls from Congress leaders for a merger.        
	The partys working committee, its top consultative group, meets here on Monday for the first time after the general election to pinpoint reasons for the NCPs current plight, party sources said.        
	Crucially, the committee will also discuss the calls from sections within the Congress for a merger with the parent party, the sources said, though the NCP officially denies any possibility of such a merger.        
	There is no plan, as of now, to merge. But there is undoubtedly increasing pressure on the NCPs leadership to consider the option, and this matter will be discussed, a Maharashtra-based member of the working committee said.        
	The NCP was formed on June 10, 1999, after Sharad Pawar, P.A. Sangma and Tariq Anwar were expelled from the Congress for opposing Sonia Gandhis leadership on the ground of her foreign origin.        
	Although it has partnered the Congress in both Maharashtra and the Centre, the NCPs growth in Maharashtra has largely come at the Congresss expense.        
	But the month leading up to the NCPs 10th anniversary has seen the partys seat strength from Maharashtra drop starkly. In 2004, the Congress had won 14 seats and the NCP nine from the state; this time the NCP won only eight but the Congress surged to 17.         
	Next came the embarrassing arrest of Padamsinh Patil, one of the partys eight MPs, on murder charges.         
	Even the rationale for the NCPs existence as an independent party has been questioned by senior Congress leaders, who argue that the issue of Sonias foreign origin  the reason for the split  is now clearly dead. Sangma, once Sonias loudest critic, has apologised to her, sparking speculation that the NCP may merge with the Congress.

	New Delhi, April 28: An Indian Navy vessel repelled a pirate attack on an Italian liner with over 1,500 on board in an operation off Seychelles, officials said today.        
	INS Nirdeshak, recently deployed at the request of the Seychelles government, organised the rescue with a Spanish warship and a French reconnaissance chopper on April 26-27 night, the navy officials added.         
	The cruise liner, with 991 passengers and 536 crew, had sent an SOS that was picked up by the Indian Navy vessel, they said.        
	Navy spokesperson Nirad Sinha said choppers flew out of INS Nirdeshak after information that MS Melody was under attack.         
	The liner, which some reports said had security personnel, tried resisting the pirates before help came. The nine pirates were handed over to Seychelles, the officials said.

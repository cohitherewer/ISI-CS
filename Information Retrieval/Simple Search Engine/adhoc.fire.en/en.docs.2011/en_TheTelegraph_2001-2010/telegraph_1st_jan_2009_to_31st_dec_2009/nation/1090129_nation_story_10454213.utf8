                                                                                                               Passport must for Haj 
                            
	New Delhi, Jan. 28 (PTI): Indians undertaking Haj will require passports from this year.        
	Saudi Arabia has informed India that visas for Haj pilgrims will be issued only on international passports and not on Haj pilgrim passes as has been the practice so far.        
	Authorities concerned in Saudi Arabia have informed that with effect from the next year, 1430 Hijri (2009), the arrival of Haj pilgrims in Saudi Arabia will be through international passports only and, therefore, from next year, Haj visas will not be issued on Haj pilgrim passes, an official said.        
	The Haj committee wants the decision postponed by up to two years.

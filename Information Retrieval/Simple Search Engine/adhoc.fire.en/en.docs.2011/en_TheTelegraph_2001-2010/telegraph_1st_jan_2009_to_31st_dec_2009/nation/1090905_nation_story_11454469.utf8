	New Delhi, Sept. 4: A womans right to life and liberty includes the right to refuse sex, decide whether to have a child, and choose whether to adopt birth-control measures, the Supreme Court has said.        
	A womans right to make reproductive choices is also a dimension of personal liberty as understood under Article 21, the court said.        
	It is important to recognise that reproductive choices can be exercised to procreate and to abstain from procreating. A womans right to privacy, dignity and bodily integrity should be respected. A woman can refuse sex, insist on contraception or choose to go for sterilisation, the bench said.        
	It, however, clarified that Indian women dont have the same liberty on abortions that can be done only when the conditions specified in the statute (Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971) are fulfilled.

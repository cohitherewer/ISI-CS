                                                                                                               Jagan nudge to Sonia
  - MLAs march to YSR son and pledge loyalty after hurried mass swearing-in         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Ministers of the Andhra Pradesh cabinet take mass oath in Hyderabad on Sunday. Picture by Vijayalakshmi                                        
	Hyderabad, Sept. 6: Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddys son Jaganmohan today spoke out on the succession race, asking his frenzied supporters to pipe down while pressuring the high command subtly by saying he knew Sonia Gandhi respected the feelings of lakhs of party workers.        
	A mob of Jaganmohan supporters, however, tried to turn a condolence meeting for YSR into a coronation event for their leader, heckling and hooting senior Congress leaders they perceived as his opponents. It forced caretaker chief minister K. Rosaiah to turn an oath-taking ceremony in the evening into something like a mass marriage.        
	Rosaiah rushed all 34 members of YSRs cabinet through a closed, short and unusual swearing-in at the Raj Bhavan, where they took oath in chorus and from where even journalists, except the official media, were barred.        
	But as soon as the event was over, all 34 ministers drove to YSRs residence and pledged before Jaganmohan that every one of them would resign if anybody other than him was made chief minister. Several of the ministers, all YSR loyalists, earlier had to be persuaded by the party high command to join Rosaiahs cabinet.        
	Officially, the government said governor N.D. Tiwaris poor health and the mourning period for YSR demanded a short ceremony, therefore the collective swearing-in. Advocate-general M. Seetharamamurthy cited a precedent: Five members of the Mulayam Singh Yadav cabinet had taken oath together.        
	Sources, however, suggested the tight security and the mass oath-taking had one purpose  to avoid the ugly scenes that forced an early end to the morning condolence meeting at the state Congress headquarters.        
	There, as Rosaiah looked on, state Congress chief D. Srinivas  who had said the party had many leaders senior to Jaganmohan  faced placards of Go back DS and shouts of Down, Down DS from young men and women supporters of YSRs son.        
	VHR go back, read one placard, referring to senior Rajya Sabha member V. Hanumant Rao who had yesterday scoffed at comparisons between Jaganmohan and the late Rajiv Gandhi. Many of the placards said: We want Jagan.        
	K.V.P. Ramachandra Rao, YSRs adviser and Rajya Sabha member, appeared on stage to appeal for calm and, when he was ignored, broke down in tears and asked the crowd to at least show respect for YSR.        
	As chaos broke out again after a while, Srinivas abruptly called the meeting off. Rosaiah, Srinivas and Union minister S. Jaipal Reddy were escorted out by their security guards even as Jaganmohans supporters tried to gherao them.        
	Jaganmohan later issued a four-page message saying: I request everyone with folded hands to stop such activities by going to the media, signature campaigns, using of banners, placards, demonstrations for my leadership as the successor of our beloved departed leader. Like my father, I am duty bound to be a loyal and disciplined Congress worker.        
	But, in a barely veiled message to the high command, he added that he expected Sonia to take a decision that would not let his fathers mission to be compromised.        
	Our beloved leader Sonia Gandhi respects the public perception and feelings of lakhs of Congress Party workers and she knows too well what is good for all of us and what is good for our state and people, he said.        
	The swearing-in had to be held to meet a constitutional requirement  since Rosaiah had taken the oath of office afresh after YSRs death, the rest of the cabinet too had to. But apparently, at least seven or eight ministers were reluctant to join Rosaiahs cabinet.        
	However, party general secretary Digvijay Singh arrived in Hyderabad and told Ramachandra Rao the high command wanted all YSRs ministers to join the new government.        
	The Congresss city unit said it would start a state-wide signature campaign in support of Jaganmohan and appealed to the central leadership to make him chief minister.        
	The Congress legislature party released a statement saying 344 people had died of shock and despair or committed suicide in the state after YSRs death.        
	It said 39 men and seven women had killed themselves, while 231 men and 67 women had died of heart attack. Some 12 men and two women had unsuccessfully attempted suicide.

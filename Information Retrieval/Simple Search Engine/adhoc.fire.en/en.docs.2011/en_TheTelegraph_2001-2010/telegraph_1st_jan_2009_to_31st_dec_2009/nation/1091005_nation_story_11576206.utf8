The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Intelligence first, govt puts terror cell on hold
                                                                                                               Intelligence first, govt puts terror cell on hold
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 4: The Centre has deferred till November-end cabinet clearance for a US-style, counter-terror agency as it wants work on an intelligence network to be completed first, sources said.        
	The cabinet committee on security, which is to sanction the proposed National Counter-Terrorism Centre (NCTC), has put off a decision till November 30, The Telegraph has learnt.         
	Home minister P. Chidambaram is keen to have such an agency in place. His ministry had aimed to finalise the proposal and get all required approvals by September 30.        
	But now the ministry feels priority must be given to completing the national intelligence grid, a channel for flow of intelligence information from a variety of sources.        
	We will go ahead with the NCTC over a period of five years but only after the intelligence grid has been put in place, a ministry official said. The counter-terrorism centre will have officials from various agencies, an arrangement similar to the multi-agency centre (MAC) that was revived after the 26/11 attack.        
	The only difference will be that the NCTC will be a bigger set-up. Once it is in place and starts functioning, the ministry may do away with the MAC, which now co-ordinates intelligence from various agencies.        
	The apex body in the intelligence system will cost crores to be set up. The NCTC will be responsible for analysing and maintaining information on internal threats and external proxy wars.        
	Setting up an agency like the NCTC and getting the desired results will take time, the ministry official said, and pointed out that it was so even in the US, which spent a billion dollars on setting up its counter-terror agency a few years back. But even they (the agency) have not been able to achieve much, he added.        
	During their visit to the US last month, Chidambaram and his officials were given a presentation on the American agency. On return, the ministry took some key decisions to empower government agencies to scan the financial dealings of suspected terror outfits and individuals.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Visa snub kills Pak trip for Mehbooba
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Visa snub kills Pak trip for Mehbooba
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                              
	Srinagar, Dec. 20: Pakistan has denied a visa to Peoples Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti, her soft separatist rhetoric notwithstanding.        
	A PDP source said the party saw the move as a snub, but Mehbooba played it down. (It) is not a big problem, she said. There is a feeling that the situation is bad there (in Pakistan, because of the rising militancy) and it will not be advisable to go.        
	The visa denial comes a year after Mehboobas first visit to Pakistan, where she received a red-carpet welcome and was treated as a state guest.         
	Some moderate separatists, though, have been averse to the Pakistani leadership cosying up to Kashmirs mainstream politicians at the expense of the separatists. Some PDP leaders suggested this as a possible reason for the visa denial.        
	A party source said Mehbooba had planned to attend a six-day social development conference in Islamabad that began yesterday.        
	Mehbooba, leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, was to be the only top mainstream politician from the state to speak at the conference. The conference organisers have expressed their helplessness, though they feel embarrassed. Mehboobaji had even booked her tickets, a PDP leader said.        
	Last year, Mehbooba had met Asif Ali Zardari (who was not Pakistans President then) and Nawaz Sharif. Zardari and Mehbooba had jointly addressed the media, annoying many separatists.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Plane scare: Srinagar in PoK 
                                                                                                               Plane scare: Srinagar in PoK 
                            
	New Delhi, March 26 (PTI): An Air India plane with 56 passengers on board, including former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, could have landed in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir had the pilot not tackled a software glitch.         
	The Airbus A320 was on a flight from Delhi to Srinagar yesterday when, according to aviation sources, the pilot, Captain Kapil Raina, saw one co-ordinate of the Srinagar airport in the navigation aid at 20 degrees left of Banihal Pass (between Jammu and Srinagar), an area which is in PoK.        
	Top Air India officials said the navigational aids of all planes were updated with a new software provided by a Swedish company yesterday in which the co-ordinates of Srinagar airport were wrongly mentioned.        
	The software company had later wrongly sent an advisory to the engineering department of Air India instead of the operational wing, the officials said.        
	But Raina noticed that the co-ordinates of Srinagar airport were wrong and used the manual landing system instead to land the flight safely.

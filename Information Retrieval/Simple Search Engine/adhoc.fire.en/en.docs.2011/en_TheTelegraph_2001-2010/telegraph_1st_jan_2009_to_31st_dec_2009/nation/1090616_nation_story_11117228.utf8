The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Indians take boy child bias to US 
                                                                                                               Indians take boy child bias to US 
          SAM ROBERTS                              
	New York, June 15: The trend is buried deep in US census data: seemingly minute deviations in the proportion of boys and girls born to Americans of Indian, Chinese and Korean descent.         
	In those families, if the first child was a girl, it was more likely that a second child would be a boy, according to recent studies of census data. If the first two children were girls, it was even more likely that a third child would be male.         
	Demographers say the statistical deviation among Asian-American families is significant, and they believe it reflects not only a preference for male children, but a growing tendency for these families to embrace sex-selection techniques like in-vitro fertilisation and sperm sorting, or abortion.         
	New immigrants typically transplant some of their customs and culture to the US  from tastes in food and child-rearing practices to their emphasis on education and the elevated social and economic status of males.         
	The appeal to immigrants by clinics specialising in sex selection caused some controversy a decade ago.         
	But a number of experts expressed surprise to see evidence that the preference for sons among Asian-Americans has been so significantly carried over to the US. That this is going on in the US  people were blown away by this, said professor Lena Edlund of Columbia University.         
	She and her colleague professor Douglas Almond studied 2000 census data and published their results last year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.         
	In general, more boys than girls are born in the US, by a ratio of 1.05 to 1.         
	But among American families of Chinese, Korean and Indian descent, the likelihood of having a boy increased to 1.17 to 1 if the first child was a girl, according to the Columbia economists.         
	If the first two children were girls, the ratio for a third child was 1.51 to 1  or about 50 per cent greater  in favour of boys.        
	Studies have not detected a similar preference for males among Japanese-Americans.        
	The findings published by Almond and Edlund were bolstered this year by the work of a University of Texas economist, professor Jason Abrevaya. He found that on the basis of census and birth records through 2004, the incidence of boys among immigrant Chinese parents in New York was higher than the national average for Chinese families.         
	Boys typically account for about 515 of every 1,000 births. But he found that among Chinese New Yorkers having a third child, the number of boys was about 558.        
	Joyce Moy, executive director of the Asian American/Asian Research Institute of the City University of New York, said family values prevalent in China, including the tradition of elder parents depending on their sons for support, have seeped into American culture even among younger immigrants, and even when some of the historic underlying reasons for the preference are less relevant here than in India, China and Korea.        
	Inheritance in the old country is carried through the male line, she said. Families depend on the male child for support.        
	Dr Norbert Gleicher, medical director of the Center for Human Reproduction, a fertility and sex-selection clinic in New York and Chicago, said that from his experience, people were more inclined to want female children, except for Asians and West Asians.         
	The preference for males among some immigrant Asians might fade with assimilation, experts said. And no one expects it to result in the lopsided male majorities like those in China, where, according to a study published this year in the British Medical Journal, the governments one-child policy has resulted in the worlds highest sex disparity among newborns  about 120 boys for every 100 girls.

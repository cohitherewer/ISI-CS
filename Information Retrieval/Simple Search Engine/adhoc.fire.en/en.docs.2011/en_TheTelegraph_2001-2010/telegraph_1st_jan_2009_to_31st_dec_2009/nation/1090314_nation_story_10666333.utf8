          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, March 13: As the ruling BJD braces for the coming polls, several legislators and senior leaders from the BJP joined the party today.         
	The joining of an Oriya film star, Siddhant Mohapatra, also added glamour to the ruling party.         
	Christian leader and president of Orissa Minority Forum Swarupananda Patra also joined the BJD, once shunned by them for its association with the BJP and the Sangh Parivar. A former minister and prominent Muslim leader from Cuttack Syed Mustafiz Ahmed also joined the BJD.         
	Welcoming the leaders, chief minister and BJD chief Naveen Patnaik said: My government has been working hard for nine years for the all-round development of Orissa and the welfare of its people. Our workers should strive to bring the party to power once again.         
	Senior BJP leader and deputy chairman of state planning board Bed Prakash Agrawal, four BJP legislators (Mahesh Sahoo, Dhaneswar Majhi, Brundaban Majhi and Sananda Marandi), former minister and Samajwadi Party state vice-president, Arabinda Dhali and former BJP legislators Rammurty Gamang and Sadan Naik were among those who joined the party today.         
	BJP state president Suresh Pujari said they were not bothered over these developments.

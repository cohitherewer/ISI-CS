The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Land scam rattles army top brass
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Land scam rattles army top brass
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 3: The army chief, General Deepak Kapoor, today met senior officers who have now retired from the armed forces and was understood to have conveyed his dismay over reports that his colleagues had been indicted for the land scam in Bengal.         
	General Kapoor hosted the former head of the Indian Air Force, retired Air Chief Marshal S. Krishnaswami, Major General (retired) Ashok Mehta and Major General (retired) Dipankar Mukherjee and about 15 others.         
	Mehta is a strategic affairs expert who frequently features on television programmes and writes in newspapers. Mukherjee heads a New Delhi-based think tank.         
	Almost all of the invitees are regarded in the military as opinion-makers because of the experience they have had in service after which they have moved on to public life commenting on strategic and defence issues. One of General Kapoors eight principal staff officers, the military secretary, Lt General Avadhesh Prakash, is among three other generals who have been summoned by an army court of inquiry in Calcutta that is investigating procedural lapses in clearing an education project on land next to a military station in Sukna in Darjeeling district.         
	The investigation has already disrupted senior appointments in the army. The appointment of Lt. General P.K. Rath, who was named as the Deputy Chief of Army Staff (information systems) has been cancelled.         
	Lt General Avadhesh Prakash, as the military secretary, is also the member-secretary of an army promotion board that will decide which officers will make it to the rank of Lt General.         
	The board is scheduled to meet next week. The Darjeeling land scam over a proposed Rs 295-crore school project is rocking the top brass in the army headquarters and has begun to draw in the West Bengal government. Prakashs lawyer sent defamation notices yesterday saying the corps headquarters in Sukna gave its assent after a nod from the state administration.         
	The court of inquiry has been convened by the eastern army commander in Calcutta and is headed by Lt General K.T. Parnaik, commander of the Tezpur-based 4 corps. Prakash, Rath, and Lt General Ramesh Halgali, Jalandhar corps commander, have been called as witnesses.         
	Army sources said the court of inquiry was yet to finalise its report. The land does not belong to the army but procedures require that the armys clearance is obtained before property is developed near military stations.

	Patna, Nov. 16: Bal Thackeray came under heavy fire in Bihar with all political parties and sporting associations raining brickbats on the Shiv Sena supremo for criticising Sachin Tendulkars Im Indian first remark.         
	The BJP, however, chose to stay away from the controversy.        
	Political rivals Congress, JD(U) and the RJD joined hands in launching the attack on Thackeray. Tendulkar has spoken from the core of his heart. He is a great sportsman and his statement will have a unifying effect on India, Nitish Kumar said, adding: Tendulkar is the role model for all youths.        
	Nitish said: The entire country respects Maharastrians and Marathi culture but the likes of Thackeray have narrow-minded visions that is regressive. They destroy themselves as well as the country.        
	Describing Tendulkars remark Im Indian first as the reflection of true sporting spirit, Nitish said: The master blasters stature has grown more after the comment. That Thackeray and his Sena were no longer popular in Maharashtra became evident in the recently concluded Assembly elections there, Nitish said.        
	Known for baiting the Thackerays, RJD chief Lalu Prasad said: Thackeray should have kept Tendulkar free from his mischievous politics. He does not deserve to comment on a person who represents the heartbeat of the nation.        
	In his inimitable style, Lalu said the master blaster, after enabling the Indian cricket team to unfurl the Tricolour in various parts of the world, had eventually clean bowled Thackeray on the Sena chiefs home turf. What do you expect me to tell if you ask me if I like Thackeray or Tendulkar? I like Tendular more and I do not take notice of these chauvinistic Thackerays and their Senas, Lalu said.        
	Bihar Congress chief Anil Sharma described Thackerays comment on Tendulkar in Shiv Senas mouthpiece, Saamna, as abominable.         
	Thackeray should be sued for his remarks on Tendulkar who is an icon and national asset, Sharma said.         
	Former cricketer and Cricket Academy of Bihar chairman Amikar Dayal said: Thackeray should be punished for his remarks. A mechanism should also be put in place to ensure that Thackeray and his likes do not issue such damning statements about players like Tendulkar who has made India proud.        
	Bihar Cricket Association secretary Ajay Sharma, too, strongly criticised Thackeray. Indian sportsmen should not take Thackerays remarks seriously. Thackerays narrow world vision cannot create and promote Tendulkars.        
	The BJP, a Shiv Sena ally, however, refrained from making any comment on the controversy. Why should we drag ourselves into such a controversy? said a senior BJP leader, adding: We have not yet read what Thackeray has written.

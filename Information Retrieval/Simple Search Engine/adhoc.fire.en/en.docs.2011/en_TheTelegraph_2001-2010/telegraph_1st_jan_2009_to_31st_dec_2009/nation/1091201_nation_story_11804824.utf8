          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 30: The rebels have come forward to provide cover for Nachika Linga, the Chasi Mulia Adivasi Sangh leader, whose name tops the list of 18 most-wanted people released by the police in connection with the attack on Narayanpatna police station on November 20.        
	He has fled his village Bhalipur in Koraput and is now staying with the Maoists, said Koraput superintendent of police Deeepak Kumar.        
	The normal raids we have been conducting at several places have proved unsuccessful and we have begun regular combing operations to nab him, Kumar said.         
	While the operation continues, a special team has been formed to zero down on the absconding tribal leader.        
	Meanwhile, during one of the raids to nab the tribal leader, the police arrested 15 people along with huge amount of arms and ammunition at Dangadi in Bandhugaon of Koraput district.

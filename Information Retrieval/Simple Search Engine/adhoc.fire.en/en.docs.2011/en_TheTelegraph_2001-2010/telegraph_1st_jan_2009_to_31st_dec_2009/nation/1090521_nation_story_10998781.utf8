          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, May 20: Delhi High Court today admitted a petition against the University Grants Commission for allowing deemed-to-be universities to drop the prefix from their names in advertisements and public documents, potentially confusing students.         
	Professor Kapil Kumar of Ignou filed the petition requesting the courts intervention in reversing the UGC decision, reported first by The Telegraph on April 28.         
	Full-fledged universities  publicly owned or private  in India can only be set up through acts of Parliament or state legislatures. The idea is that universities should be accountable to the people through their elected representatives.         
	Deemed universities, on the other hand, are educational institutions recognised by the UGC as institutions with potential to become full-fledged universities.         
	Till now, these institutions have had to call themselves deemed-to-be-universities in advertisements, in their prospectus, and in any other public or official documents.         
	But the UGC has now allowed them to drop the prefix  with the proviso that they state below their name they are recognised by the UGC act under the section on deemed universities. The proviso helps students make a distinction between universities and deemed universities.         
	But students may well miss the distinction, allowing deemed universities to confuse applicants into believing that they are full-fledged universities.         
	The UGC decision allowing deemed universities to drop the prefix follows sustained pressure from these institutions to allow them to call themselves universities.         
	India has 124 deemed universities.

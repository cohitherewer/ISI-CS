The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Board set to take IPL final call
                                                                                                               Board set to take IPL final call
          OUR BUREAU                               
	Mumbai, March 21: The Indian cricket board is expected to take a final decision tomorrow on the cash-rich Twenty20 league that has run into a security tangle amid a further blow from the Maharashtra chief minister who said the state could not provide forces for matches in the state.        
	With time fast running out for the second edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), scheduled between April 10 and May 24, the board today decided to take the vexed issue to its all-powerful working committee.         
	An emergency meeting of the working committee will be held in Mumbai tomorrow and we will discuss the IPL issue, said an official of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).        
	Ashok Chavan, the Maharashtra chief minister, today categorically said the government could not provide security for IPL matches during elections.         
	Chavans statement contradicts that of his home minister Jayant Patil, who said last night that the state would secure the matches as the dates did not clash with polling days.        
	Maharashtra has been allotted 18 games: as many as 14 in Mumbai, including the final, and four in Nagpur.        
	The chief ministers view echoes that of Suprakash Chakravarty, the DGP-rank officer in charge of poll security, who said yesterday forces could not be spared for games in Mumbai.         
	Though Mumbai police commissioner Hasan Gafoor has said security would be available, police officials and those in the cricket administration are sceptical. Chakravarty, besides outranking Gafoor, has the final say on security issues as the man designated by the Election Commission to supervise polls in the state.         
	BCCI officials are, therefore, keeping all options open. IPL organisers have maintained that if the tournament cannot be held within the scheduled window, it would be difficult to fit it in given the cramped international calendar. Any postponement will also mean massive financial ramifications.        
	IPL commissioner Lalit Modi put up a brave face by reiterating that the organisers had multiple schedules ready to deal with security concerns.        
	Lets not speculate on what is happening. As I told you yesterday, we have 42 different schedules prepared for different types of situations. There is no issue in any way. We have a back-up for a back-up, Modi said after an informal meeting with senior BCCI officials in the city.        
	Modi will meet the eight franchise owners after the working committee meeting and apprise them of the situation.        
	Some options for the IPL are to have a packed schedule  with up to three matches in a day  and shorten the tournament, and/or restrict the matches to states that are willing to provide security. Another option is to shift the tournament overseas.         
	We are ready for any eventuality. Everything will be discussed and finalised at the meeting tomorrow, Modi said.         
	Home ministry sources said they are yet to receive written feedback from all the states slated to host the games.         
	Bengal has agreed to the latest revised schedule with games slated in Calcutta between April 11 and 26, four days before the first round of polling in the state. Andhra Pradesh has said it cannot host matches in April.

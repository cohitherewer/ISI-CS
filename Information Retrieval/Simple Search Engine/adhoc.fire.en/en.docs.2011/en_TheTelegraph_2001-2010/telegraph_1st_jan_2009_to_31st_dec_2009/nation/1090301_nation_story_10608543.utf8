          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 28: Bar Council of India chief Suraj Narain Prasad Sinha today said disciplinary action would be taken against any lawyer found guilty of misconduct during the recent clashes inside Madras High Court.        
	Lawyers found guilty will be hauled up, Sinha said. If they are found to have acted in a manner not conducive to professional ethics, action will be taken against them. But only after a thorough inquiry, the bar council chief added.        
	The clash between lawyers  striking in support of Tamil civilians in Sri Lankas war-torn north  and police had prompted an unprecedented shutdown of all courts in Tamil Nadu from February 19-24.         
	Although the Supreme Court has announced a judicial probe, the lawyers are yet to end their boycott of court proceedings.        
	Lawyers associations are deliberating whether to end the boycott or wait till retired Justice B.N. Srikrishna submits his interim report to the court in a fortnight.

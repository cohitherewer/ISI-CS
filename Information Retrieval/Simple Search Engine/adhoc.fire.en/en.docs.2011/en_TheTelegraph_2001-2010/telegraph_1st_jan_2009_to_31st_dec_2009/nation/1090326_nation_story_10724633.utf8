	Bhubaneswar, March 25: The dream of Rahul Gandhi to infuse fresh blood into the grand old party took a beating in Orissa with state Youth Congress president Rohit Pujari quitting to join the BJD today.        
	I am quitting the Congress, as it has betrayed the youth, Pujari, 36, said at a news conference this afternoon.        
	Distribution of party tickets for the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections was the principal reason behind his sudden decision. Young leaders of the party had been betrayed and denied ticket to panchayat and civic polls. Now, they are once again being neglected, he said.        
	Pujari, a resident of Jhaduapada in Sambalpur town, is a mechanical engineering graduate from BIT, Mesra. He was working with Tata Steel as an engineer, but had quit his job to join the Youth Congress in 1997.        
	Rahul had assured us that youths would be allotted 30 per cent of the tickets for the coming Lok Sabha and Assembly polls in the state. But I was informed no youth leader was given party ticket even though the final list is yet to come out, said Pujari, an aspirant for Sambalpur Lok Sabha seat.         
	Senior leaders have formed a cartel and are distributing tickets among themselves, alleged the youth leader who had apparently been humiliated by state Congress chief K.P. Singhdeo at Deogarh recently by not offering him to address party workers.        
	Asked whether he was quitting the party for this, Pujari said: Yes that is one of the reasons. The youth leader said any Oriya youth with self-respect cannot stay in a party like the Congress. One has to camp at Delhi waiting for days to meet the AICC leaders. The time and energy wasted there can be devoted to the service of people, he said.        
	Later, Pujari formally joined BJD at its headquarters here in presence of chief minister Naveen Patnaik. However, it was not clear whether he would get a BJD ticket for the coming polls.        
	Kandhamal demand        
	Cuttack-Bhubaneswar diocese archbishop Raphael Cheenath today demanded setting up of polling booths at the relief camps in riots- hit Kandhamal district and provision of postal votes for the members of minority community now staying outside the district.        
	Who will guarantee the citizens right to vote in Kandhamal? Even after seven months, about 3,200 people are still staying at the camps, he said. It is the responsibility of the state government and the Election Commission to ensure that election is held in Kandhamal with adequate security in place. Many people whose election identity cards were burnt in the violence have not been provided alternative identity cards, said Cheenath.

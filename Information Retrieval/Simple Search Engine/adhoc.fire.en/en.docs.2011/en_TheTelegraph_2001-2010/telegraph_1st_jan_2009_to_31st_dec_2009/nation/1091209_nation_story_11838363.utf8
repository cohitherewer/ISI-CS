The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | NSG miffed with Lalu
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      NSG miffed with Lalu
          NALIN VERMA                          Commando chaos for Lalu prasad?                                  
	Patna, Dec. 8: He believes in freedom, at least in his fiefdom. His speech is unique without any grammatical bindings; so are his letters, which hardly bear punctuation marks. His politics has always been freethinking, lacking any strict ideology.        
	When the National Security Guard (NSG) reportedly complained about Lalu Prasad violating rigid security norms, people close to him were not surprised.        
	The premier counter-terrorism force deployed for his security is believed to have lodged a written complaint to the Union home ministry about the violation. Lalu Prasad does not allow NSG escorts to sit in the protected persons (PPs) vehicle, the NSG letter to the ministry says, explaining the procedure as to how it is a must for an escort to sit in the PPs vehicle to form a fool-proof protective ring around the VIP.        
	Those who usually accompany the former railway minister revealed that the boss gets irritated at the sight of a stern-faced armed guard sitting very close to him. Instead, he prefers to travel with his favourite masseur (not a professional one), who doubles as a supplier of khaini (tobacco) to him. Besides, he keeps on speaking  especially on long drives whatever he feels like to his companion and driver.         
	Secondly, his companions on the journeys said that the former chief minister stopped his vehicle wherever he saw crowds waiting to take a glimpse of him and felt like talking to them. Travelling on lonely stretches on the highway he has also been seen relieving himself by roadside. Apparently, the well-trained NSG commando, doing his duty with stipulated norms, might not allow Lalu Prasad to indulge in laid-back and happy-go-merry actions.        
	Ironically, Lalu Prasad was peeved about the Union government withdrawing the NSG commandos for a brief period after he lost his position as the railway minister. Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar openly said that Lalu Prasad did not require an NSG cover.        
	Moreover, Lalu Prasad has another trait in his personality. Though he has been a mentor of several trigger-happy Bihar dons, including Md Shahabuddin, Pappu Yadav and Anand Mohan, he is very frightened of a gun close to him. Yeh (gun) khatarnak cheej jai. Pata nahin kab fire ho jaye (It is a dangerous thing. No one knows when it can accidentally fire, Lalu invariably says at the site of a gun-toting security personnel in proximity.        
	The man is known more for formulating his own rule  be it in matter of clothing, eating or governance. Probably, true to his style, he wishes the NSG to guard him the way he wants to be covered rather than the stipulated rules.        
	In response to the NSGs complaint, the Union home ministry requested Lalu Prasad to abide by the security rules, said sources. But can NSG rein in his freestyle nature?

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, July 9: China recently objected to a move by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to fund a flood control project in Arunachal Pradesh, India disclosed today, shedding fresh light on the tenacity with which Beijing pursues its pet themes.        
	New Delhi finds the opposition a clear violation of the charter of the multilateral lending agency, the government told the Rajya Sabha today.        
	Foreign minister S.M. Krishna told the Rajya Sabha during question hour that India had made it clear to all member nations of the ADB that political considerations could not be cited for prohibiting the bank from evaluating any project.        
	All member countries on the board of executive directors of the ADB, except China, supported the funding plans, the minister told the House.         
	China did not endorse the country partnership strategy (CPS) for India on the board of the ADB on the ground that the proposal involved technical assistance funding for the flood and river erosion management project in Arunachal Pradesh which China claims is its territory, the minister said.        
	India had told the ADB and all member countries, including the US, Japan, Australia, Canada, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Germany and Italy, the CPS was not a political document and it did not make any judgement on the legal status of any territory.         
	The member countries were also told that Chinas objection on political grounds is a clear violation of the ADBs charter which prohibits the bank from evaluating any proposal on grounds other than economic, the minister said.         
	Indias CPS was discussed in the meeting of the board of executive directors of the ADB on June 15 and all member countries except China supported the document, Krishna explained.         
	He said New Delhi had conveyed to the ADB member nations, including China, that Arunachal Pradesh was an integral part of India and its status is not negotiable.        
	ADB assistance has to be strictly decided on economic parameters and not on political considerations, he added. Ultimately, the ADB had gone with Indias point of view.        
	We have put across (to China) in the strongest diplomatic language possible that Arunachal Pradesh is an integral part of India. We have friendly relations with our neighbour China. We are engaged in a multilateral activity with them. Our trade is growing and we would like to continue in that direction, Krishna added.         
	The two countries will meet in New Delhi next month to discuss the boundary issue, the minister said.         
	The minister also spoke of plans to visit Arunachal Pradesh shortly. Previously, the President and the Prime Minister had visited the state, which had drawn Chinese protests.

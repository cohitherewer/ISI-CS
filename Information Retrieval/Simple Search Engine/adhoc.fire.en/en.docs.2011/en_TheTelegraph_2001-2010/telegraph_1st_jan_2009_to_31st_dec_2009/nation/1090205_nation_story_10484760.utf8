          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 4: Jindal Steel and Power Limited (JSPL) expressed its intention to use the environment-friendly coal gasification technology for the first time at its upcoming 12.5MT integrated steel plant in Angul.        
	Talking to the reporters here, JSPL executive director (projects) Rajesh K. Jha said there would be no problem in adopting the technology, since the required ingredient for the process  non-coking coal  is abundantly available in India and particularly in Talcher region of Orissa.         
	The gasification route will reduce dependence on imported coking coal, said Jha who is in-charge of the Angul project. JSPL has taken the initiative of producing syngas as a substitute for natural gas to make direct reduced iron.

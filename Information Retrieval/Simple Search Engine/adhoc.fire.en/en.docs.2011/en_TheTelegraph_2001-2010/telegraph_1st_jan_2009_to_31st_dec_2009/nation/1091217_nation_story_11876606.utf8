	New Delhi, Dec. 16: Rajnath Singh will formally step down as BJP chief on December 24 when the partys parliamentary board  its highest decision-making body  meets.        
	He will pave the way for the elevation of Nitin Gadkari, his possible successor.        
	BJP sources said the process of leadership change at the top would be set in motion next week. They said L.K. Advani, the leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, is expected to announce his future plans at a meeting of the parliamentary party on December 21, the last day of the winter session.        
	A meeting was held yesterday, ostensibly to ensure enough members turned up to hear the government on climate change after the Copenhagen summit which ends on Friday.        
	However, the government itself is not sure of extending the session beyond December 18, because not too many MPs are likely to return to the capital for just a day after the week-end break.        
	But because we insisted on a statement on climate change and a discussion after that, we dont want to have a situation where only half a dozen of our members show up. If there is a parliamentary party meeting that Advaniji will address, we can be sure that at least a majority, if not all, will be present, said Sushma Swaraj, the deputy leader in the Lok Sabha.        
	Privately, a source close to Advani confirmed he would make an announcement but wouldnt disclose if he intended to step down as the leader of Opposition.        
	Just wait and see, the source said.        
	Gadkaris name will be declared by the end of this month. At least 20 persons from different states will have to sign his nomination papers.         
	He will be formally elected in mid-January when 50 per cent of the states will have completed ongoing organisational elections and constituted the required number of electoral colleges to elect the new party chief. The elections, scheduled to be over by December 15, are running behind time. While the Jharkhand unit has been busy with the Assembly elections, the Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh units were preoccupied with local body polls.        
	Rajnath is expected to demit office a day after the Jharkhand verdict is out.         
	Barring a brief appearance in Parliament for the Liberhan debate, he has been grounded in the state.        
	A Rajnath aide claimed he began his innings as BJP president by delivering Jharkhand and hoped to sign off with an encore.

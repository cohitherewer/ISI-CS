The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Priyanka checks out home in the hills
                                                                                                               Priyanka checks out home in the hills
          MANJEET SEHGAL WARRIOR                        The bungalow Priyanka (in picture below) is building in Shimla				                                             
	Shimla, June 16: They live 3km apart in Delhi, but Sonia Gandhi and Pratibha Patil could turn next-door neighbours in Shimla for brief periods during the hot months, thanks to Priyanka Gandhi.        
	That can happen once a two-storey mountainside bungalow, now under construction amid acres of orchards, is completed by the year-end at Charabra village, 13km from the Himachal Pradesh capital.        
	The house is being built by Priyanka, and sources close to her said one of its four bedrooms had been earmarked for Sonia, who might accompany her to Shimla on short holidays.        
	The bungalow is set just 500 yards from the Presidential Retreat, a guesthouse where Indias Presidents customarily spend two or three weeks every summer. No construction, therefore, is allowed nearby and there were a few murmurs when the Presidents office and the states previous Congress government gave Priyanka permission to build the house in 2007.        
	The two buildings are the only structures within a 3-4km high-security zone, surrounded by orchards and wild flowers and offering stunning views of blue mountains with snow-capped peaks.        
	The foundation of the bungalow was laid on September 6, 2008, with a havan performed by Priyanka and her family.        
	The house is being built on a part of a 3,184sqm plot and is expected to be complete by the end of this year, said local Congress worker Kehar Singh Khachi, who is supervising the construction by a Delhi-based company.        
	Another source said: The ground floor will have a kitchen, a dining hall and a guest room. The first floor will have four bedrooms and a study.         
	The architecture, they added, is a mix of modern and British. The sand used in the construction is being transported from Solans yellow-stone mines, and the slate stone for the roof from Kalkhar in Mandi district.        
	Security is watertight. Nobody is let into the compound and last year, the guards roughed up a group of photographers and snatched their cameras after they clicked Priyanka.        
	From a distance, masons can be seen working on the slanting roof, virtually the only part still unfinished apart from the boundary wall. Furnishing, however, will take another six months.        
	Priyanka and Sonia had arrived in Charabra on Sunday morning to monitor construction. They checked in at the five-star Wild Flower Hall hotel nearby and left today.        
	The states current BJP government has assured all help. Its an honour for the state to have an important dignitary like Priyanka becoming a resident, chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal said.        
	If she can be the catalyst in bringing Indias two most powerful women to Shimla in the summer, it would be a little like the old days when the Rajs top administration would hurry to Indias summer capital as the sun grew too harsh on the plains below.

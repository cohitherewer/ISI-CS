          G.C. SHEKHAR                                             
	Chennai, May 29: M.K. Stalins long-awaited promotion as the official number two in the DMK government came today when he was named deputy chief minister of Tamil Nadu through a terse Raj Bhavan communiqu on the advice of his father and chief minister M. Karunanidhi.         
	With elder son M.K. Azhagiri taking office as Union cabinet minister, Karunanidhi swiftly rolled out the succession plan that puts Stalin, 56, firmly in line for the chief ministers post in the future.         
	The wheelchair-bound chief minister also unburdened a few of his portfolios, including industries and public administration (IAS officers), on his younger son. The crucial home portfolio, however, remains with Karunanidhi.         
	Stalin will retain charge of local administration, the ministry he now holds.        
	Karunanidhi said that in view of his poor health  he has been wheelchair-bound for almost a year  he had decided to hand over some of his portfolios to Stalin and also to make him deputy chief minister after consulting party deputy general secretary and finance minister K. Anbazhagan.         
	This is the first time the state has got a deputy chief minister. Even during MGRs illness and his indifferent tenure between 1985 and 1987 after recovering from a kidney transplant and a stroke, the state never had a deputy chief minister though his number two  Nedunchezhiyan  used to hold fort in his absence.        
	The question who after Karunanidhi has been answered with unmistakable clarity through this appointment. That, however, does not mean that Stalins ultimate elevation or his authority will not be challenged in the post-Karunanidhi scenario, said a DMK senior, suggesting the ambitious Azhagiri may not respect his fathers decision forever.         
	Stalin, a DMK activist since the 60s, has been rewarded for his patience as he has rarely argued his case. His first official recognition came in 1980 when he was made the DMK youth wings secretary  a post he continues to hold in spite of being a grandfather. Early this year, he was made the party treasurer after having served as deputy general secretary for over a decade.         
	For Stalin, it has been a long and at times reluctant journey. Pushed into the limelight by his persistent father, he has struggled to grow under the multi-faceted Karunanidhis shadow and emerge as a leader in his own right. At times, Karunanidhi would loudly hint at greater responsibility for Stalin but would dither and hold back at the last moment because of family pressures.        
	Even a year ago, Azhagiri did not want Stalin to be named Karunanidhis heir apparent. After he took oath as Union cabinet minister yesterday, that problem was solved.        
	Only during this election campaign did Stalin evolve into a full-blown leader, spearheading the partys campaign after his father was confined to a hospital bed.         
	As the local administration minister, he earned the respect of officers for taking quick decisions and clearing files fast. He would ask a few pointed questions and would then sign the file without any procrastination, said a senior IAS officer.         
	With both politician-sons taken care of, Karunanidhi will have to address the ministerial aspirations of his daughter Kanimozhi, who lost out in this round of government formation in Delhi.         
	But DMK insiders believe she will be inducted soon after Karunanidhi offers to share power with the Congress in the state in return for a berth for his daughter, who was among the first to welcome Stalins elevation today. His hard work has been rewarded, she said.

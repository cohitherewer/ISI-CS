The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Street caste battle shifts to booths
                                                                                                               Street caste battle shifts to booths
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI IN TONK AND SAWAI MADHOPUR                           Gujjar leader Bainsla in Tonk district                                   
	Mustard farmers Vishambhar Singh Gujjar and Raghuram Meena make no attempts to hide their sentiments towards the others community.         
	Politically though, they share a theme. Neither cares for any political party, but come May 7, they will vote for their caste, and its security.         
	The contest in the Tonk-Sawai Madhopur seat is laden with ironies that are alternatively described as pragmatism and opportunism.         
	The region continues to suffer from water shortage, poor education and health facilities.         
	Two years after the Gujjar demand for reservations and subsequent clashes with the Meena community brought Indias largest state to its knees, parties and their policies are incidental in the elections here. A direct face-off, politically this time, between a Gujjar candidate and a Meena candidate here has led to fresh reinforcement of dedicated caste-based identities.         
	The election is being viewed by voters like Vishambhar, from the village of Tordi in Tonk district, and Raghuram, from Sawai Madhopur districts Aligarh village, as a war between the two communities, its outcome determining whether Gujjars or Meenas dominate here over the next five years.         
	I know there are so many ironies in the way this election is being fought, given what has happened over the past two years. But this election is a battle for survival, brother. If we lose, we would be no better than prisoners of war, said Vishambhar.         
	The first and most stark irony lies in the competing candidates.         
	Colonel (retd.) Kirori Singh Bainsla, the man who became the face of the Gujjar agitation against the then BJP state government of Vasundhara Raje Scindia, is the candidate here for that very party, the BJP.         
	After police fired at Gujjar protesters killing 70 over a series of agitations spread over 2007 and 2008, Bainsla, in an interview had compared Scindia to British General Dyer of the Jallianwala Bagh infamy.         
	Amid persistent suggestions by his critics that he wanted to enter politics, Bainsla had said repeatedly that he would not.         
	Today, the BJP candidate from the Tonk-Sawai Madhopur parliamentary constituency shares space with Scindia in campaign posters that ask for votes citing his struggle  never mind that it was against the BJP government.         
	Asked to explain the turnaround, the 76-year-old Bainsla smiled and said: Not now.         
	His family, however, claims it was neither self-interest nor opportunism but bravery on his part to contest these elections as a BJP candidate. If he loses, his stature stands reduced. Yet he is contesting because he realised that while he could continue to remain on a pedestal as a social leader, he needed to enter politics to realise his vision for his community, one of Bainslas children told said on condition of anonymity.         
	And as for choosing the BJP, one must learn to separate emotions from reality. Yes, the BJP messed up in the manner in which it dealt with the agitation, but it is the only party that has promised reservations for Gujjars.         
	(All three of Bainslas children are central government servants  his two sons are in the army and his daughter Sunetra is an income tax commissioner in Delhi. Government officers are not allowed, under service rules, to air political preferences.)         
	Standing against Bainsla from the Congress is Union minister of state for environment Namo Narain Meena.         
	The Congress has claimed throughout these Lok Sabha elections that it is the BJP that is fostering caste-based politics and that the Grand Old Party stands against such divisive politics.         
	But Meenas candidature from this seat  reserved for Scheduled Tribes when he won the last time but now a general seat  has angered many Gujjars.         
	The Congress could have fielded a non-Gujjar, non-Meena candidate. By fielding a Meena, the Congress is clearly playing favourite between the two communities, said Ramvir Singh, a Gujjar in Malpura village in Tonk, where Gujjars and Muslims, in that order, are the dominant communities.         
	The Congress argues that Meenas candidature was not determined because of his caste but because he is the sitting MP from the Sawai Madhopur district that has now been merged with Tonk into a single constituency. Sawai Madhopur district is dominated by Meenas.         
	But the irony runs deeper than just in the names of the candidates nominated by the Congress and the BJP.         
	During the Gujjar agitation for quotas, when Bainsla and his fellow protestors railed against the Scindia state government, the BJP was largely viewed by Gujjars as pro-Meena and against their community.         
	That sentiment was reinforced by the state governments support to inflammatory comments made by Kirori Lal Meena, a senior BJP legislator who has since left that party.         
	The Congress, on the other hand, fielded Dausa MP Sachin Pilot as its Gujjar face, and worked hard to be seen as the party that could deliver on concerns raised by the community.         
	Two years on, the roles have reversed. It is the BJP that is pinning hopes on Gujjar votes by fielding Bainsla, and the Congress is relying on the consolidation of Meena votes behind its Union minister candidate to win.         
	Nationally, both these parties have been harping on development as their poll plank.         
	Here, less than 500km from the national capital, caste has won even before the first vote is cast.

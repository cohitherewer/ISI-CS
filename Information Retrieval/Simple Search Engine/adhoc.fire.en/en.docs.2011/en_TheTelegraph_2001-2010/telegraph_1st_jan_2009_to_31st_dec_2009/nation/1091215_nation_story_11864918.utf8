          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 14: The chief of Nepals army, General Chhatra Man Singh Gurung, was today made an honorary general of the Indian Army by President Pratibha Patil, who is the supreme commander of the armed forces.        
	The honour to Gurung, part of a tradition between the militaries of India and Nepal that was sundered after King Gyanendras takeover in 2005 but was restored last year, emphasises Delhis deep interest in encouraging a regular army in Nepal that will remain professional and apolitical, defence ministry sources said.        
	Such a description is in itself a political move.         
	One of the sticking points in the peace accord between Kathmandu and the increasingly belligerent Maoists in Nepal is the demand that the rebel militia  which calls itself the Peoples Liberation Army (PLA)  should be integrated into the regular army.        
	Senior generals in the Nepal army, including its director-general of military intelligence, have spoken out against integrating politically indoctrinated soldiers among the regular ranks.        
	General Chhatra Man Singh Gurung, in a presentation to the Indian Army chief, General Deepak Kapoor, and senior officials was understood to have touched upon the subject shortly before his investiture ceremony in Rashtrapati Bhavan today.        
	The Indian Army also gave a presentation on Indian security perspectives.         
	But an army spokesperson, Colonel Om Singh, asked about the views exchanged on the integration of the rebels into the regular Nepal army, said he would not comment on political developments.        
	The spokesperson said Nepals army was largely trained by the Indian Army and was also dependent on it for supplies.         
	Also, a large number of Nepali Gorkhas were among the ranks of the Indian Army.        
	General Gurungs visit, he said, assumes special significance in the light of enhanced bilateral co-operation between the two countries.         
	He said sustained cooperation between the two armies is ongoing in the fields of training, visits, equipment co-operation and miscellaneous mutually beneficial activities.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Varun goes to jail, proud mom drops in   Two-day stint with books for company

          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                          Frenzied supporters reach out to shake hands with Varun Gandhi as he leaves the court in Pilibhit on Saturday. (Reuters)                                        
	Lucknow, March 28: Varun Gandhi today surrendered before a Pilibhit court and was sent to the district jail for two days, his supporters immediately drawing alleged parallels to prison stints by Indira Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru.        
	BJP candidate Varun, 29, arrived in his constituency this morning and drove to the chief judicial magistrates court in an open jeep at the head of several thousand noisy, flag-waving supporters. Earlier, Allahabad High Court had refused to quash an FIR against him for an alleged hate speech against Muslims.        
	If that speech meant Varun had decisively disowned one Nehru-Gandhi legacy  secularism  his backers argued he had today donned another family mantle by becoming the first of the younger Gandhis to go to jail.        
	Varuns father Sanjay Gandhi was jailed in the late 1970s, and his grandmother Indira in 1943 (during the freedom movement) and again after losing the 1977 polls. His great-grandfather Jawaharlal had spent long years in prison during British rule, writing acclaimed books from behind bars.        
	Varun, who settled down in a quickly spruced-up under-trial cell around 4pm, had come without any belongings and apparently missed his books. Minutes earlier, he had asked BJP vice-president and Uttar Pradesh handler Kalraj Mishra, who was with him through the morning and afternoon, for a few works of fiction.        
	Around 5pm, two bags were brought for him, containing a few books, a flask of cold water, three T-shirts and writing materials. Jail authorities handed them over to their VIP prisoner except the water.        
	Varun will not be allowed outside food and must follow the jail code strictly since the Election Commission is scrutinising everything, jail sources said.        
	At 6.30, Varuns mother and fellow BJP candidate Maneka Gandhi, campaigning in her nearby constituency of Aonla, arrived to meet him. Im proud of my son; he is a brave person to have courted arrest, she said.         
	Varun looked a little unsettled after the court ordered his jail custody, Kalraj said. But he shook off that feeling and said he was not afraid to spend a few days in jail for a cause.        
	Varuns march to the court through Pilibhits streets, from 11am to 12.45pm, had been peaceful with police showing no interest in arresting him. When the magistrate jailed him around 2.45pm, the crowd broke into applause outside the court, indicating this was what they and Varun wanted.        
	But soon the mob turned violent, stoning the cars of the district magistrate and the police chief outside the jail. The police shot in the air and then fired rubber bullets, injuring at least 15 people.        
	The poll panel has asked for a report from the district administration on the violation of prohibitory orders by the mob. Kalraj accused the police of unprovoked firing and claimed the crowd was made up mostly by ordinary people rather than BJP supporters.        
	Some 20,000 supporters, mostly young men and women, had gathered in Pilibhit today to receive Varun, with Kalraj overseeing the arrangements. They carried saffron flags instead of the BJP flag, since the party is wary of angering the poll panel, which has advised it not to field Varun.        
	The candidate, wearing a red kurta, his forehead smeared with a jaitilak (victory dot), repeatedly got off his jeep to walk with the crowd.        
	Just before entering the court, he declared: I have come here to boost the morale of my supporters, my society and my countrymen. If my going to jail inspires people I am ready to do so.        
	The judge told his lawyers there was no warrant against their client, and if he wanted to surrender he must file an affidavit mentioning the laws under which cases had been registered against him.         
	Varuns bail application will be heard on March 30.

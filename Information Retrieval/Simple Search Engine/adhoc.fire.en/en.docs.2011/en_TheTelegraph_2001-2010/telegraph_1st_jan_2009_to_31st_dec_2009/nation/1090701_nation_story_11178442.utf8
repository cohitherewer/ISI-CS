          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 30: The mystery behind the resignation of Athgarh MLA Ramesh Rout, and his absence since then, deepened today with Speaker Pradeep Amat directing Rout to personally appear before him by July 5.        
	Amat issued a directive in this regard, seeking an explanation as to why Rout quit from his post. The Speaker also wrote to director-general of police to provide security to Rout.         
	The MLA has remained incommunicado ever since he resigned as a member of the Assembly on July 19. With Routs family alleging that the MLA did not return home since the day he tendered his resignation, Athgarh BJP members today filed a missing case at Athgarh police station.        
	BJP members have threatened to come out to the streets if Rout is not traced in the next 48 hours. Rout had submitted his resignation in person to the Speaker at his residence on June 19.         
	With his mobile switched off, Rout has remained out of contact and his whereabouts remain a mystery.        
	Talking to the media on his resignation, Rout on June 19 had said that he took the step to make way for former MLA Ranendra Pratap Swain to return to the Assembly.         
	He added that he wanted to pave the path to a Athgarh by-election.        
	But, a second letter allegedly written by Rout and circulated in the media on June 23 said he had tendered his resignation under pressure.

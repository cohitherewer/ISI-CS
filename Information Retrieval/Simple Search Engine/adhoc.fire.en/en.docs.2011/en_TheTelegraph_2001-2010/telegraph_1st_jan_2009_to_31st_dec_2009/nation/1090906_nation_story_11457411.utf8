The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pak holding up Saeed probe: Chidambaram 
                                                                                                               Pak holding up Saeed probe: Chidambaram 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT       
	New Delhi, Sept. 5: On the eve of a key visit to the US, Union home minister P. Chidambaram has revealed that India has given concrete evidence to Pakistan on Hafiz Saeeds direct involvement in the 26/11 terror attack and accused Islamabad of deliberately holding up investigations against the Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief.         
	Ajmal Kasab, the only surviving terrorist from the squad that struck Mumbai, was handpicked by Saeed for the job, Chidambaram has said, and the entire operation masterminded by him.         
	Hafiz Saeed was in the camp and met the trainees. He was accompanied by a person known as Major General Saab. Hafiz Saeed finally selected the trainees and gave them new names. Kasab was given a new name  Abu Mujahib  that name was given by Hafiz Saeed. Then they underwent marine training at a training camp and Hafiz Saeed was present for that training too. On the 13th day of Roza, the selected trainees were called to the office of the Bait-ul-Mujahideen and Hafiz Saeed met them there. I could go on. Places, dates, names, conversations, Chidambaram told Al Jazeeras English channel today, in what appears to be a calibrated information offensive against the Pakistani establishment.         
	Based in Doha, Al Jazeera news channel is not only widely viewed in Pakistan, but also in key western listening posts such as London and Washington, where Chidambaram is headed.         
	While in the US, Chidambaram is scheduled to meet secretary of state Hillary Clinton and national security adviser James Jones; his talks, sources say, will essentially focus on counter-terror cooperation with special emphasis on the 26/11 probe and activities of Pakistan-based terrorists.         
	Stating that he was thoroughly, totally dissatisfied with the Pakistani response to promises on tackling the guilty of Mumbai and the terror infrastructure as a whole, Chidambaram said: They (the terrorists) are still on Pakistan soil. We know their names... we have shared their names with them. They are not investigating the case. The trial hasnt opened yet. It will be a year on the 26th of November. Where is the trial? Where is the chargesheet? When is a trial starting? When is the first witness being examined?         
	In response to another question on whether, like President Barack Obama, he too was scared by the situation in Pakistan, Chidambaram said: Pakistan does not scare us, it worries us. We want a stable government in Pakistan. There is considerable instability in Pakistan. We want Pakistan to behave like a responsible nation. Their behaviour does not inspire confidence.         
	Asked whether he thought the Pakistani establishment was deliberately holding up investigations, the home minister said: Yes. Regrettably that is the answer, but yes.         
	Pressed with a question on whether the court proceedings against five others in Pakistan did not amount to action, Chidambaram responded, a little irritably: Well, firstly I am a trained lawyer, so youll have to accept my word as against a non-lawyers word. The evidence that we have presented tells any investigator, any prosecutor what Hafiz Saeed did, where he was, whom he met, what he told them, what his role was. If that is not evidence to continue investigation against Hafiz Saeed, what else is evidence?         
	Chidambarams strong indictment of the Pakistani role in probing the Mumbai terror attack may appear to run in the face of Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs determination to press on with talks with Islamabad, but the home minister himself saw no contradiction between his position and the foreign policy direction chosen by the UPA government.         
	He also argued, like the Prime Minister, that the Sharm-el-Sheikh joint statement had been wrongly interpreted and that action against Pakistan-based terrorists remained an Indian pre-condition for resuming the comprehensive dialogue. It is a condition, that you will punish the perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks. That has been our position since December. Sharm-el-Sheikh will not change that position. Although that statement is being interpreted the other way, he said.         
	On the Naxalite question, the other big-ticket worry for the home ministry, Chidambaram admitted that governments had underestimated the menace for over a decade, during which they had grown, recruited and acquired more arms and weapons.         
	Tackling Naxalites, he said, will take some time, but indicated an offensive is in the works. States (where Naxalites have bases) are now in overdrive to fill the vacancies. As we speak, I know that they are recruiting and training about 85,000 people. There is still a gap and I have told them that this should be completed by the 31st of March, 2010. I hope they will heed that advice.         
	I know that we have to do a bit of catching up but thats precisely what I have told them both in January 2009 in the first conference and August 2009 in the second conference. We are very serious we will tackle the menace and overcome it.

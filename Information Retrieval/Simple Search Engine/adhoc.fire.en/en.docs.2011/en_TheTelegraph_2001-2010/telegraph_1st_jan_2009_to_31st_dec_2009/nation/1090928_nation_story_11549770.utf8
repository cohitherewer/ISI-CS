                                                                                                               In jail, Ghandy plans book on late wife

	New Delhi, Sept. 27: Khobad Ghandy, the suspected Maoist leader now in solitary confinement in Tihar jail, is planning his memoirs, which will focus on his late wife and their two decades of struggle together, sources said.        
	Ghandys book on his wife Anuradha, who was the lone woman member of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) central committee, will be in the form of a memoir, the sources indicated. She died on April 12 last year of cerebral malaria. Ghandy had married Anuradha in 1983.        
	The book, if it materialises, will perhaps be the first in Ghandys own name.        
	The Doon School alumnus has been writing about political economy in economic journals and newspapers under the pseudonym Arvind. However, he will not use his other pseudonym Azad, which he had adopted as an underground spokesperson of the CPI (Maoist), the sources said.        
	Ghandy, who is suffering from cancer and cardiac problems, has requested officials for writing and reference material from the jail library, the sources added.        
	Officials at Tihar jail said Ghandy was also keen to write a book on political economy and has requested material on the subject. The alleged Maoist, who is yet to be officially informed under what charges he has been booked, has asked for a copy of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act to study its sections, the sources said.        
	Ghandys lawyer Rajesh Tyagi confirmed to The Telegraph that Ghandy was planning to write and that the jail officials had given him the required paraphernalia.        
	What, however, remains to be seen is if Ghandys health permits him to carry on with writing. Sources said his condition was deteriorating with every passing day.        
	We will get a clearer picture of his health when he is taken to G.B. Pant Hospital on September 30. The jail authorities are not taking care of him and his heath is our primary concern. We are also yet to start any legal proceedings. When we approached the police special cell to give us a copy of the FIR, they told us that they were under no obligation to provide it to us and asked us to move the court. We are moving Delhi High Court on Tuesday, said Tyagi.        
	The sources said the special cell was believed to be preparing to take Ghandy into police custody for questioning. The police might move court for his custody on October 1, a day after his medical examination, the sources added.        
	 Police forces from Jharkhand and some other states are also said to be preparing to move court for his custody, the sources said. However, police officers in Delhi denied that they had received any requests from the security force of any other state.        
	The man is ill. We dont expect him to reveal much anyway as we have gathered that he was out of active involvement in Naxal-related movements for a year now, said a police officer.        
	Ghandy is said to have been picked up on September 17 while his arrest was shown on September 21.

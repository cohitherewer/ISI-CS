          OUR BUREAU                              
	Patna, May 2: Lalu Prasad today blamed Kalyan Singh for the Babri Masjids demolition and added that he had nothing to do with the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister though they shared a common friend in Mulayam Singh Yadav.        
	He (Kalyan) is a convict in the Babri mosque demolition case, the RJD chief said.        
	He was quick to clarify that Kalyan was not a member of Mulayams Samajwadi Party which, along with the RJD and Ram Vilas Paswans LJP, is contesting the polls together in the Hindi heartland.        
	At a rally in Uttar Pradesh, Mulayam said his friendship with Kalyan  who is contesting as an Independent from Etah  would not be affected by what Lalu Prasad had said.        
	Sources said Lalu Prasads attack on Kalyan was prompted by the realisation that Muslims had not yet pardoned the former BJP leader and that the RJD might suffer if the community got the impression that he (Lalu Prasad) was soft towards Kalyan.         
	RJD insiders said they didnt think Lalu Prasads barbs would affect the partys new-found bonhomie with Mulayam, who has a tactical tie-up with Kalyan.

                                                                                                               Divorcees cry for pension rights
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 23: Divorcees travelling to Bhubaneswar from all over the state for their pension-related work have to face a harrowing time once here. Usually seen as failures, shunned by families and with little money and nowhere to go, most of these women are forced to seek shelter at railway stations facing physical, mental and sexual threat.        
	Bringing their voices to the fore and protesting against the lack of government support, thousands of women from across the state took to the streets on Wednesday demanding a shelter home in Bhubaneswar.        
	We have to travel alone minus male escorts as sometimes our families want to have nothing to do with us. With little money for hotels, we are forced to spend our days at railway stations. Distant relatives who allow us to stay in their places also harass us, said Shahin Bano, from Kendrapara.        
	About 3,000 women under the banner of Talaki Mahila Sahayata Samiti (TMSS) shouted slogans and marched across the streets demanding rights. The right to the shelter has been TMSSs fight for long.         
	And the group has shot off memorandums to chief minister Naveen Patnaik demanding a new policy to provide pensions to Hindu divorcees to help them live with dignity.        
	Though there is a pension provision for Muslim divorcees, there is no such provision for Hindu women, said Mirza. Currently only 616 muslim women receive pensions amounting to Rs 400 per month and another 546 divorcees have applied for it, said activist Saira Banu.        
	The women are also demanding budgetary allocation in the supplementary budget to provide the pending pension to 546 women according to Muslim Women Protection Rights on Divorce Act-1986.         
	Supreme Court had asked the government to make a provision of Rs 26 lakh for the purpose, said TMSS president Ashfaq Ali.         
	Besides 10 per cent reservation, activists were also demanding allotment of houses under Indira Awas Yojana, BPL cards and inclusion in the Anapurna scheme.

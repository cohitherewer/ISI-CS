The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Stars gone, Sourav banks on stayers
                                                                                                               Stars gone, Sourav banks on stayers
          PRATIM D. GUPTA                          Contestants of Knights and Angels perform at a news conference in Mumbai on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, Feb. 20: Shoaib Akhtar bowled, Umar Gul stumped, and now Ricky Ponting run out. But the early blows havent ruffled Kolkata Knight Riders captain Sourav Ganguly. Nor has the pouring-partner switch from Pepsi to Coca-Cola.        
	A day after Ponting withdrew from the second season of the Indian Premier League, Sourav sounded matter-of-fact. We were aware of this much before and we have already sought a replacement, he told The Telegraph.        
	 Anyway, he wasnt available for the best part of (last) season. We had suffered last year because of this and this time we are looking for players who would play all the matches.        
	One constant presence the Knights are assured at their games is Sprite, the clear lemon drink of Coca-Cola, which has tied up with Shah Rukh Khans team. While many see the tie-up as Coke renewing relations with one-time endorser Sourav, the man himself is surprised.        
	I dont think its because of me, Sourav said. All these decisions are taken by Shah Rukh and Jai (Mehta, Knights co-owner).        
	But he doesnt mind taking the decisions from the judges seat for Knights amp; Angels, the new reality TV show produced by Shah Rukhs Red Chillies to search for the countrys first official cheerleader team.        
	Earlier I used to pick cricket teams (as Team India captain), now I pick cheerleaders, Sourav smiled. They are important for the team. You see there are lots of young boys in the Knight Riders line-up!        
	While Knights amp; Angels, premiering next weekend on the small screen, will mark Dadas TV debut, he is also committed to hosting a quiz show on a Bengali channel. I thought of giving it a try on TV, the cricketer said. The quiz format drew me. It should start by August.        
	That is, after the IPLs second season, where Sourav expects the Knights to do better than last year.        
	He said: Its important that the players who get into a rhythm are available throughout. Last year, Brendon McCullum and Ponting could only play four matches, Gayle we couldnt even play.        
	But can Mashrafe Mortaza, bought for $600,000 (Rs 2.94 crore), fill the shoes of Shoaib and Gul?        
	You have to understand its not a selection; its an auction and so the price of a player is determined not by his capability but by what the other teams are bidding for. Mortaza plays for a weak team and so, much of his good bowling goes unnoticed. We expect him to do well but we will surely miss Gul quite a bit.        
	Just like Team India, perhaps, might miss a certain Sourav Ganguly on the New Zealand tour?        
	It will be a tough tour, Sourav said. The pitches did quite a bit last time and given their all-seam attack, the ball will seam around this time as well. But he feels coach Gary Kirsten has transformed the team.        
	A coach should be a friend, Sourav said. The moment he wants to dominate, the team runs into trouble. The same thing happened with (Kevin) Pietersen. Indian cricket has also had a history.        
	For Sourav, its back to the judges chair. And will we see a quick jig? I danced for the Hero Honda commercial with Hrithik (Roshan) nine years ago. That was the first and the last time.        
	What about a song? Sourav kept mum but the word is that he sings Ekla cholo re in one of the episodes.        
	Sourav has spoken to SRK after his shoulder surgery. He said he was feeling better.

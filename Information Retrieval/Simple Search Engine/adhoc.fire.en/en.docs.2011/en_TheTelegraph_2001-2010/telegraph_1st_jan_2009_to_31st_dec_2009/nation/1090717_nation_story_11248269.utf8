          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Kharagpur, July 16: Left unions that had stalled work on a Tata project here for a day on July 13 have withdrawn their agitation after the company agreed to meet two demands.        
	The CPM-backed Citu and the CPIs Aituc had demanded a job for a member of each of the land-loser families after Telcon Construction Equipment Company issued a notification on July 11 inviting applications for a training programme.        
	The company had made no job promise but had decided to provide free training to one member of each family that held plots in the 250 acres given to Telcon.        
	The course, aimed at enhancing employability in the area, had set eligibility conditions such as Madhyamik pass and an age range of 18 to 25. The unions had demanded that the minimum qualification be brought down to Class VIII pass and the age ceiling be raised to 35 years.        
	At a tripartite meeting convened by the sub-divisional officer of Kharagpur, S.B. Sarkar, with the unions and Telcon representatives, the company agreed to meet the demands to raise the age limit and lower the qualification.        
	We have agreed to these two demands. We hope that now there will be no problems in meeting our deadline, said Apurba Ganguly, general manager (projects) of Telcon.         
	The union leaders said they were happy their demands were met through talks.

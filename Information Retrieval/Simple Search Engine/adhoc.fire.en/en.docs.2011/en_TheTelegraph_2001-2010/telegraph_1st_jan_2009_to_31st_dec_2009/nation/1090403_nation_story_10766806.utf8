The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Madan drops off Cong list
                                                                                                               Madan drops off Cong list
          MANJEET SEHGAL WARRIOR                                          Madan Lal: Outsider    
	Shimla, April 2: Madan Lal has withdrawn as the Congress candidate from Hamirpur, barely two weeks after being declared the nominee, in the face of resistance from local leaders who claim he has been dropped.        
	The former cricketer, part of the 1983 World Cup-winning team, was said to have been under pressure from hostile party leaders even after he began his campaign.        
	Lals replacement is Narender Thakur, a former BJP leader who joined the Congress a few months ago.        
	The decision to withdraw came after Lal was admitted to a hospital in Noida with a heart ailment.         
	The cricketer, who hails from Himachal but has long been living outside, was to take on chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumals son Anurag.        
	Anurag, the chief of the Himachal cricket association, is said to have done a lot for the game in the hill state. Some local leaders had expected a close fight, considering the rivals common background.        
	Those in favour of Lal had felt he alone could give Anurag a tough fight in a constituency where 65 per cent voters were under 35.        
	Narender is said to have the blessings of senior leaders, including former chief minister Virbhadra Singh, and state Congress chief Kaul Singh Thakur.         
	Lals name wasnt proposed by the district or block Congress members. Narender will be a better candidate as he has been opposing (chief minister) Dhumal for the past six months, Kaul said.        
	Kaul didnt say why the Congress was foregoing the chance to cash in on Lals celebrity status, in a move that might eventually end up helping the BJP.         
	Vidya Stokes, the Congress leader of Opposition in the state, said she was surprised at the resistance to Lals candidature.

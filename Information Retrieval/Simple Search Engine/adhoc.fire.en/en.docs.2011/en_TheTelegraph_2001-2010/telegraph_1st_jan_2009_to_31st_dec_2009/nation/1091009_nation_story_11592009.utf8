	Patna, Oct. 8: One Puran Singh, 22, was killed and two persons were seriously injured when an engine and six bogies of Amrapali Express jumped off the tracks near Pasaraha railway station in north Bihars Khagaria, 200km from here, last night.         
	East Central Railway (ECR) authorities said the express with over 600 passengers jumped off the tracks around 11.45pm at the place where a trench had formed due to rainwater that accumulated along the tracks.        
	Singh, a Purnea resident, died on the spot while 22 others, suffered injuries, said the ECR chief public relation officer, Dilip Kumar. The woman, Shastri Devi, who suffered serious head injuries, was admitted to Khagaria hospital for surgery, while the rest were released soon afterwards.         
	Officers from Barauni and Khagaria rushed to the spot for the rescue, said Kumar, talking to The Telegraph. He added that a special train from Barauni reached the accident site around 3pm and took the passengers to Katihar. The Indian Railways paid an ex gratia of Rs 15,000 to the deceaseds family and Rs 5,000 to the woman who suffered serious injuries.         
	As many as five pairs of local trains running between Katihar and Barauni stations were cancelled. Routes of 16 long-distance trains, including Dibrugarh-Guwahati-New Delhi Express and Northeast Express, were changed. Two trains from Sonepur and Katihar and railway staff, including Hajipur additional-general manager of ECR also reached the spot after the accident.        
	The commissioner of railway safety (eastern circle) under the civil aviation ministry will probe into the mishap.        
	Work is on to fill the crater and repair tracks damaged in the wake of the accident, sources said. Two trains with cranes have been engaged to remove the damaged bogies and fish out a portion of the engine that is still lying in the ditch.

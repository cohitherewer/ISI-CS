          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Srinagar, Oct. 10: A Pakistani suicide bomber with 30kg of RDX strapped to his body and plans to target troops in Srinagar was shot dead after residents fearing mayhem informed police.        
	The police said Omer Maviya, a Hizbul Mujahideen militant, had plans to throw a grenade in a Srinagar locality and open fire in a ploy to draw security forces. He expected the forces to close in on him and would have detonated the explosive once they did so, said Kifayat Hyder, the police chief of Pulwama, where Omer was killed on Thursday night. Pulwama is 35km from Srinagar.        
	Hyder attributed the polices success to the villagers. The operation involved chasing an injured Omer, losing sight of him briefly and cordoning off seven villages before he was shot near a stream.        
	We had no input from intelligence agencies. Whatever information we had was from locals. But there were only faint leads. Sheer luck helped us, Hyder said.        
	Hyder said the police found Omer in the house of Jahangir, a Hizbul sympathiser they had gone to question after getting the information about the bomber.        
	A small contingent went to his house and three of our men entered the place. To their surprise, they found Omer there, Hyder said.        
	Alarmed, the duo lobbed a grenade that forced the three policemen to scamper out. Omar and Jahangir slipped out of the window, firing at the personnel who gave them chase. The police retaliated and a bullet hit Omers shoulder, a police source said. Despite the injury, Omar managed to escape in the darkness.         
	A search operation, with troops from the CRPF and the armys 53 Rashtriya Rifles, was launched and seven villages were sealed.         
	During the search, we heard somebody talking on his mobile near a stream. We found Omer lying there. We opened fire and a bullet hit him in the head, the source said.         
	The commandos were stunned to find the explosives on his body. The RDX weighed 30kg and could have caused massive damage. We also found two grenades and an AK47. We later learnt that the (Hizbul) militants first tried to dispatch a Kashmiri youth on the (Srinagar) mission but he backed out, Hyder said. A hunt is on for Jahangir.

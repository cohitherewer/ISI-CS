The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Dissenting Maneka in tiger team
                                                                                                               Dissenting Maneka in tiger team
                            
	New Delhi, Sept. 21 (PTI): The Centre has included Maneka Gandhi as a member of a reconstituted body for tiger conservation, although the BJP MP had opposed a legislation paving the way for the body in 2006.        
	The National Tiger Conservation Authority was set up in August 2006 following amendments to the Wildlife Protection Act.         
	Maneka, an animal rights activist, had opposed the amended bill in Parliament, terming it the worst bill since 1947, which would kill tigers.        
	Asked about her membership, Maneka said that despite being a bad bill, she supported it now because at least it was a step further to save the wildlife.        
	Headed by Union environment minister Jairam Ramesh, the tiger body includes eight wildlife experts and two MPs  Rajya Sabha member Santosh Bagrodia and Gandhi.

	Mumbai, July 27: The cracking of the Gateway of India-Zaveri Bazaar blasts will be remembered as one of the most successful terror investigations in India, where a clueless start was capped by lighting arrests.        
	Five days after the August 25, 2003, explosions, police detectives in disguise  dressed as sweepers, hawkers, salesmen and rationing officers had picked up four key suspects in storybook fashion.        
	The twin blasts, the biggest in Mumbai since the 1993 serial bombings, had initially presented the crime branch team headed by then additional commissioner Rakesh Maria with a headache.        
	Unlike the 93 strikes, carried out by known gangsters from the smuggling syndicates of Dawood Ibrahim and Tiger Memon, here the investigators were up against a brick wall.        
	The first clues came from Shivnarayan Pandey, the driver of the black-and-yellow taxi that had exploded at Gateway of India. He told the police a Muslim couple accompanied by a teenaged daughter and a baby girl had hired his taxi on August 24 and 25.        
	On both days they had driven to the Gateway. On the second day, they had got off and left for lunch minutes before the 1pm explosion blew up the cab.        
	Pandey, who survived because he had been taking a stroll on the landmark tourist spot, later became one of the 103 prosecution witnesses who testified in the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Pota) court.        
	Pandeys description of Fehmida Sayyed, now 43, appeared to match that of a burqa-clad woman who was suspected to have planted a similar bomb in a bus at Ghatkopar just four weeks earlier.         
	The taxi drivers statements helped the police prepare sketches, which another informant was able to recognise. He led the police to the Chimanpada slums in the western suburb of Andheri, the home of the three persons convicted today: Hanif Sayyed, 46, Fehmida, and Ashrat Ansari, 32.        
	Policemen in camouflage kept round-the-clock watch on them before swooping on the suspects.        
	Investigations showed that the day before the blast, Hanif, Fehmida and their two daughters had hailed Pandeys taxi near Shoppers Stop in Andheri and surveyed the Gateway. They told him they would again need him the next morning.        
	Around the same time, Ansari and Nasir Ahmed the alleged mastermind and Lashkar-e-Toiba operative who apparently indoctrinated and trained Hanif in Dubai are believed to have conducted a recce of the Zaveri Bazaar site.        
	The Sayyeds returned home to assemble the 25kg explosives at their hutment till 3am, and climbed into Pandeys taxi at 11.30am. After the blast, they boarded a bus to Mahim, then took another to reach home.        
	Special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam said he would argue for the death penalty for all three convicts, nailed for offences under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, the now-defunct Pota, Explosives Substances Act and the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP pitch: Advani or none
                                                                                                               BJP pitch: Advani or none
          SANJAY K. JHA                               
	New Delhi, May 8: The BJP has said it will not support any alternative formation if L.K. Advani cannot become the Prime Minister.         
	Under no circumstances shall we support any other Prime Minister. There is no possibility of changing this decision, come what may, party president Rajnath Singh said.        
	Advani and the partys key strategist, Arun Jaitley, too, have ruled out extending support to any other government.         
	The BJP, which believes the chances of Manmohan Singh returning as Prime Minister are remote, suspects the Congress could come under pressure to support a third front government in the name of secularism.         
	It is clear now itself that a Congress-led government is not possible. By the afternoon of May 16, the Congress will have to decide whether they will support the third front or not. If Rahul Gandhi does not want to look beyond 15 months, he can support a third front government. If he is working for his politics for the next 15 years, he will sit in Opposition. In that case, we will form the government, Jaitley said in an informal conversation with the media.         
	What this revealed is that Jaitley does not expect the NDA to be called first by the President to form a government.         
	This means the BJP thinks the NDA will fall way short of the majority mark of 272 and prospective allies, too, would wait for the Congresss move first. The third front would be the second alternative and the BJP-led government the last.        
	This is despite the confidence within the BJP that it will be the single largest party.         
	The partys psephologist, G.V.L. Narasimha Rao, has made a presentation before top leaders on the basis of field reports  exit polls, which are being referred to differently for the fear of the Election Commission  in which he has claimed the BJP will get around 165 seats and the Congress 131.         
	He also claimed the UPA would be restricted to 160 seats, while the NDA will reach 215.        
	Even if this were to turn out true, the NDA would have to manage 60 more seats which wont be easy.         
	The BJP doesnt have too many allies to look to  it might be tough for the ADMK, Telugu Desam and TRS to yield 60 seats even if they do agree to join hands with the party.         
	The BJP would then require the support of Mayavati, too. But the party has seen revival signs in Uttar Pradesh this election and state leaders would fiercely oppose any understanding with Mayavati or Mulayam Singh Yadav that could reverse the rising tide.

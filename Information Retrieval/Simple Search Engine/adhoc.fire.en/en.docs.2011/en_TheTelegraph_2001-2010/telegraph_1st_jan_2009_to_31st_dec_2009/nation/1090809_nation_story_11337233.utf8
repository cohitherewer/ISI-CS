The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Garbage row gets another deadline
                                                                                                               Garbage row gets another deadline
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Aug. 8: Orissa High Court has set a fresh deadline of 24 days for the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) to phase out multiple garbage dumping yards within the city and to dispose of all solid waste at Bhuasuni on the citys outskirts.        
	A division bench of judges Laxmikanta Mohapatra and Indrajeet Mohanty directed the BMC for making the waste to energy power project at Bhuasuni fully functional and close all temporary dumping yards by August 31.        
	The court issued the order yesterday after going through affidavits submitted by the state government and the BMC, making identical claims that the process to discontinue multiple garbage dumping and enable solid waste disposal at Bhuasuni was underway in a phased manner.        
	The high court has been pressing for adoption of a single-point garbage disposal system by the BMC since August 2007, while monitoring solid waste disposal in Bhubaneswar as part of a PIL.        
	About 61.41 acres of vacant land at Bhuasuni under Bhubaneswar tehsil had been allotted by the government for the single-point dumping yard vis--vis waste to energy power project in February 2008.         
	The BMC, however, has been disposing of nearly 450 tonne garbage at seven dumping yards located within the city daily.         
	The court fixed September 4 as the date for the next hearing and further directed the state government, Cuttack Municipal Corporation and the BMC to file affidavits by then giving a status report on steps taken by them to implement the ban on the use of recycled polythene bags in the state.        
	The court is monitoring solid waste management in Cuttack and Bhubaneswar as part of a PIL filed by advocate S.N. Panda and unchecked use of recycled polythene as part of PIL filed by the Orissa Federation of Consumers Organisation.        
	The Orissa government had imposed a ban on sale, import or store of non-biodegradable polythene carry bag (less than 20-micron thick with effect from January 26, 2004), but had not followed it up with a ban on recycled polythene. The government had also ordered a ban on the non-biodegradable product on April 24, 2008.        
	While there was unabated manufacturing and use of polythene bags despite a ban on it, the government lacked sincerity in implementation of the ban. Besides, the CMC and BMC had achieved nothing tangible even after empowering them with power to enforce the ban, it was pointed out to the court.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 5: Gangster Bikram Mallick was caught late yesterday night while attempting to flee from Jharpada special jail where the contract killer was lodged.        
	Later, while he was frisked, a secret compartment was found in his footwear, where police believe he would hide a mobile phone. While searching his cell, a mobile phone charger and quite a few SIM cards were also found.         
	Mallicks escape attempt has triggered suspicion of his possible involvement in the murder of jail warder Manas Nayak, who was shot at on Sunday.         
	After being caught, the criminal (Mallik) was frisked. It was then that we found a cut in his shoes. We believe that he would hide a mobile there and use it whenever he went to the lavatory, said inspector-general (prisons) V. Thyagrajan, who rushed to the jail after the criminal was caught.        
	After the murder of the jail warder, security was beefed up in the jail. Last evening, authorities also decided to move gangsters and hardened criminals to isolated cells.         
	Mallik, who shared his cell with one Sushil, became agitated by the move. While being taken to another cell, he got angry and then resisted all attempts to move him. Finally, he hit his escorts and tried to climb to the roof, said police commissioner B.K. Sharma.         
	Mallik also injured two jail warders in the process. However, jail staff fired three rounds in the air and a scared Mallik aborted his attempt.         
	Thyagarjan, commissioner Sharma and deputy commissioner of police Himanshu Lal visited the prison after Mallik was caught. A search of his cell led to the discovery of the mobile phone charger and SIM cards. Previouly, cell phone jammers were installed in the jail, but, as todays discovery of the chargers and SIMS shows, it failed to check the use of cell phones by inmates.        
	Mallik has been the prime accused in cases of contract killing, including the murder of BJD leaders Surendra Mohanty and Sudarsan Parida. He was also booked for escaping from Jharsuguda jail last year.        
	Authorities today moved Mallik to an isolated cell where police wish to keep him in handcuffs. We have prayed for the permission to cuff him for a long period of time, said Thyagarajan.        
	During the past four days, police have arrested three men, including Mitu Jena, an accomplice of gangster Hyder. According to reports, the personnel are going through the call history of Jena and the two others to see if any call was made to Mallik.        
	Authorities have stepped up vigil and prisoners visitors are being put through strictest security checks.

                                                                                                               PM offers Karzai assistance
          OUR BUREAU AND PTI                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 10: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today spoke to Afghan President Hamid Karzai and discussed the situation arising out of Thursdays attack on the Indian embassy in Kabul.        
	Singh expressed deep sorrow over the death of 17 Afghans in the attack and offered to arrange for medical treatment of the critically wounded.        
	India may also announce assistance to the families of two Afghan police constables, Alam Khan and Mohammad Usman, who prevented the explosives-laden vehicle from gaining access to the embassy gate.        
	The Prime Minister spoke to the Afghan President after foreign secretary Nirupama Rao returned from Kabul. Rao held talks with Karzai, Afghan foreign minister Dafdar Rangeen Spanta and national security adviser Zalmai Rassoul.        
	The foreign secretary reiterated Indias unwavering commitment to pursuing our bilateral development partnership and assisting the people of Afghanistan, an Indian statement said.        
	However, India stopped short of directly naming Pakistan as the key suspect. The attack was clearly the handiwork of those who are desperate to undermine Indo-Afghan friendship, the foreign secretary said.

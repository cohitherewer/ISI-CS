The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Navy grounds fighter fleet
                                                                                                               Navy grounds fighter fleet
                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 25 (PTI): The navy has grounded the entire Sea Harrier fleet after one of the fighter planes crashed off Goa last week.        
	This has left its lone aircraft carrier INS Viraat without aerial firepower.         
	The Sea Harriers have been grounded following the crash that left a fighter pilot dead, navy officials said here today.         
	With the grounding of the 10 Sea Harrier jump jets, INS Viraat, which started functioning after an 18-month refit a fortnight ago, may have to sail to the Gulf of Aden next month without its fighter planes.        
	We cannot operate the aircraft till the inquiry is complete and the reasons for the crash are known. The problems identified by the probe need to be rectified before the jump jets are airborne again, officials said.         
	The probe could take long as the aircraft does not have a flight data recorder and the wreckage needs to be examined minutely, they added.         
	Following a series of crashes since induction, the navy is now left with just 10 Sea Harriers of the over 20 it had bought in the mid-1980s.         
	The navy plans to replace the Sea Harriers with the MiG 29K, procured from Russia in 2004. However, the MiG 29Ks are expected to join the service only by the end of this year.

          G.C. SHEKHAR                              
	Chennai, Dec. 15: Back on the campaign trail after a brief boycott of elections, Jayalalithaa is fishing in troubled marine waters.        
	The ADMK boss is hoping to tap the discontent of Indian fishermen over a coastal fishing legislation to end the victory run of the DMK-led front in eight Tamil Nadu by-elections since 2006.        
	Jayalalithaa has fielded candidates for two Assembly by-elections on Saturday and has also been spearheading the ADMKs campaign.        
	If elections are held in a free and fair manner, we will win both the seats, she said after completing her campaign at Tiruchendur in south Tamil Nadu where her partys expelled MLA joined the DMK after quitting his seat.        
	At Tiruchendur, with an eye on the fishing community, she targeted the Centres new Maritime Fisheries (Regulation and Management) Bill that seeks to impose stringent conditions on fishermen who stray beyond Indias waters.         
	The ADMK is the first party to highlight the dangers the bill poses to the livelihood of lakhs of Indian fishermen, she said.        
	In Vandavasi, the ADMK is confident of weaning away a sizeable chunk of votes that would have gone to the PMK, which is staying out of the fray.        
	The bypoll results will have no impact in the Assembly, but the DMK is seeing every by-election as a prestige fight.

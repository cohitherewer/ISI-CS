                                                                                                               Varun seeks damages 
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 13: Varun Gandhi today moved the Supreme Court seeking Rs 10 lakh in exemplary damages from the Mayavati regime for allegedly continuing to harass him.        
	The petition pointed out that the Uttar Pradesh government had refused to revoke the March 29, 2009, detention order against him despite a recommendation from a UP advisory board.        
	Varun has requested the money be paid to the Supreme Court Legal Aid Services, which provides for free legal aid to the poor.        
	In its May 8, 2009 letter, the board had told the state there was no sufficient ground to detain Varun under the National Security Act and directed it to revoke the order.

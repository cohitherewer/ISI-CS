          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Thiruvananthapuram, June 12: The Kerala CPM has geared up to fight the prosecution of party secretary Pinarayi Vijayan legally, toning down its strident protests against governor R.S. Gavai.        
	A communiqu issued today after a CPM secretariat meeting repeated the politburo line that the governors sanction in a corruption case to prosecute Vijayan was unfortunate but omitted the reference to political motivation. The statement says the party will fight the legal issues involved in the governors decision.        
	Other Left partners, such as the CPI and the RSP, made it clear this evening they didnt favour a course of agitation against the governor, after having toed the initial CPM line opposing the governors sanction at a cabinet meeting in the morning.         
	T.J. Chandrachoodan, the RSPs all-India general secretary, issued a statement in Delhi calling for restraint in the protests against the governor and saying the case should be pursued legally.        
	He felt such protests would be counter-productive.The CPM statement said: Pinarayi Vijayan will be able to prove his innocence in the court. The party is neither perturbed nor anxious about this(the party) will face, adhering to Leninist (organisational) principles, all attempts to destroy the party its unfortunate that the governor rejected the decision (against prosecution) taken by a duly elected cabinet.        
	theres no truth in reports that all party ministers barring three had offered to resign en masse.         
	Sources said leaders of the Vijayan faction attacked chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan, the states secretarys long-time rival, at the secretariat meeting for justifying the governors move. Achuthanandan had said Gavais nod hadnt surprised him.        
	The chief minister was accused of even surpassing the Congress-led Opposition in putting the party in the dock. The Vijayan faction is bent on disciplining, and possibly unseating, Achuthanandan, arguing that his continuance would fan dissidence. The party is treading cautiously, though, as any such action would send the signal that the veteran is being targeted for his stand against corruption.        
	The CBI special court is in the process of listing the 300 documents submitted by the agency in support of the charge-sheet in the Rs 100-crore Lavalin scam, which dates back to 1996-98, when Vijayan was power minister. Sources said Vijayan, the seventh accused, would be able to challenge the report in the special court.         
	There was no logic in challenging the constitutional validity of the governors sanction separately in Kerala High Court as action had already been initiated on the basis of the clearance. The CBI is free to prosecute former power secretary K Mohanachandran, first accused, and former joint secretary A. Francis, eighth accused, as no government sanction is needed to move against retired officers under the Prevention of Corruption Act.         
	The agency is preparing to approach the Centre for Interpol assistance in prosecuting Lavalin, the ninth accused. Former Lavalin vice-president Claus Trendl, party to the conspiracy, would be held directly liable for the loss to the exchequer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | high hopes crash   Sensex takes deepest dive of budget day 
                                                                                                               High hopes crash     -  Sensex takes deepest dive of budget day 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	Mumbai, July 6: High expectations gave way to deep disappointment on the markets today, triggering the steepest-ever slide in stock prices on a budget day.        
	The sensex lost 869.65 points or 5.83 per cent to end at 14043.40, the biggest fall after October 24, 2008, when the index plunged by over 1000 points.         
	Paper wealth of Rs 254,153 crore went up in smoke as investors smouldered about what they felt was lack of incentives in the budget.        
	The biggest worry on the markets mind was how the government would bridge the yawning fiscal deficit that is expected to balloon to 6.8 per cent. The interim budget had forecast the deficit at 5.5 per cent.        
	If the government borrows to make up the shortfall, interest rates could jump at a time industry is clamouring for cheaper credit.        
	Other disappointments revolved around lack of further liberalisation in foreign direct investment and unequivocal statement of intent on divestment. The proposal to raise the minimum alternate tax (MAT)  which requires companies to pay up even if their taxable income is low or nil  served as another damper.        
	Some analysts felt that once the market reads the fine print, prices might bounce back soon but selling pressure could be at play for some more time.        
	The loss of the Left parties clout had made the market players fairly confident that the finance minister would push through reforms, apart from unveiling other investor- and industry-friendly measures.        
	The rising hopes had seen the sensex giving returns of more than 50 per cent in the first quarter of this financial year  the best quarter since March 1992. However, the hopes were dashed as the budget did not contain any big-bang reforms or even a roadmap.        
	Moreover, several sectors like housing finance, real estate and infrastructure, which were widely expected to get some incentives because of the downturn, were ignored.        
	The budget has fallen short of high market expectations. The street has reacted negatively to issues such as high projected fiscal deficit. More important, there is no roadmap to bring it down. There was also no mention of reforms in petroleum and insurance sectors, besides the absence of focus on aggressively pushing ahead with the divestment programme, said Gaurav Dua, the head of research at Sharekhan, a share brokerage.        
	Added Arun Kejriwal, director of KRIS, an investment advisory firm: The budget lacked clarity on many fronts. It was a good opportunity lost by the finance minister.        
	The disenchantment was so deep that at one point the sensex was hammered to as low as 13959.44, a 953-point crash. The index later managed to recover some ground.        
	The selling spree was such that even information technology, which is expected to benefit from fringe benefit tax (FBT) abolition and extension of the tax holiday by one more year, was not spared. Nearly all the sectoral indices in the BSE ended in the red.        
	An exception was the fast-moving consumer goods sector which finished more or less in the green, led by ITC. The companys shares rose by 3.4 per cent as the finance minister did not burden tobacco with high excise duties, contrary to what the street had feared.        
	The BSE bankex (index of bank stocks) led the sectoral losers list. Stocks of SBI, ICICI Bank and many others were hit because of worries over the governments possible borrowing programme.         
	All the Reliance stocks, including that of Reliance Industries Ltd which is expected to gain from the budget proposals, also ended in the red because of concerns over the higher MAT.        
	Among the other sector indices, the realty index fell 7.28 per cent, metal by 6.57 per cent, power by 6.36 per cent, oil and gas by 5.81 per cent and public sector by 5.51 per cent. Of the 2,633 stocks traded on the BSE, around 2,020 stocks declined, while 550 stocks advanced.

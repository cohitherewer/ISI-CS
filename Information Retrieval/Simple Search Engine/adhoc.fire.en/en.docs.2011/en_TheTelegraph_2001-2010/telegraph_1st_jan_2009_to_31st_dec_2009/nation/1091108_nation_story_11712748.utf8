	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 7: The All Orissa Baptist Churches Association will take up programmes for the next year to build a relationship with other communities in the backdrop of last years anti-Christian violence in Kandhamal.        
	There is a need to build stronger relationships between Church and different faiths in Orissa, said Swarupananda Patra, the association general secretary and chairman of Orissa Secular Front. Religions should not divide people, but unite them, said Patra, addressing students of Utkal University today.

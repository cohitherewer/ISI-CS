	New Delhi, Aug. 12: The Samajwadi Party today took the hard political call of ruling out withdrawal of support to the UPA government for now, saying ground realities in the heartland dictated the decision.        
	Our priorities are clear. We have to fight a long battle against Mayavati and overthrow her despotic regime. Thats priority No. 1. Second, we have to strengthen our party and organisation, a senior Samajwadi leader told The Telegraph.         
	We cannot be taking on two formidable adversaries simultaneously. We need the Centres support because we are waging a battle to reclaim our territory in Uttar Pradesh and not in Delhi. So wheres the question of pulling out of the UPA?         
	At best, the Samajwadis could consider pulling out closer to the next Lok Sabha elections in 2014, by when Assembly polls in Uttar Pradesh would be over, the leader said. The state is scheduled to go to the polls in 2012.        
	The Samajwadi leader added that his party  which like Lalu Prasads RJD and Mayavatis BSP offered unconditional support to the UPA government from outside  would place a political resolution on its decision at its two-day national executive from August 19.        
	The resolution would mention the merits and demerits of its decision.        
	I am not denying that some of our members and workers have reservations about this (staying with the UPA for now), the leader said.        
	We will have a freewheeling discussion and the speakers can express their views. But in the end, they will be told about the imperatives of the decision.         
	Speculation that the Samajwadis were reconsidering support to the UPA was set off by general secretary Amar Singh, who issued a series of statements before leaving for Singapore for a kidney transplant.        
	The Samajwadi leader had alleged that the Congress had taken his party for granted after the party bailed out the Congress-led UPA government in a trust vote in Parliament on the Indo-US nuclear deal in July 2008.         
	Amars grouse was that the UPA had taken the help of both the Samajwadi Party and the BSP. He said the Congress would have to make a choice.        
	Last week, Amar told a news channel during an interview how hurt he had felt after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh refused to set up a co-ordination committee of the Congress, the Samajwadi Party and its allies.         
	Amar claimed Manmohan had told him that such a committee would have to include the BSP also.         
	The Samajwadi general secretary alleged that he had called up Sonia Gandhi but the Congress presidents aides had said she was not available.         
	In the budget session, the Samajwadis, led by their chief Mulayam Singh Yadav, had openly sided with industrialist Anil Ambani in his battle with his estranged brother Mukesh.        
	The party also demanded the resignation of petroleum minister Murli Deora, accusing him of being pro-Mukesh.         
	Sources in the Congress said they were confident of riding out what one of its leaders described as a meteorological disturbance and not a storm.         
	The polity is polarised between the UPA and the NDA. The so-called third front is a non-starter, a Congress general secretary said.        
	Leaders like Lalu Prasad and Mulayam, if they protest too much, can leave us and go to the NDA. But they cannot be hanging in mid-air, thats the reality, the leader added.

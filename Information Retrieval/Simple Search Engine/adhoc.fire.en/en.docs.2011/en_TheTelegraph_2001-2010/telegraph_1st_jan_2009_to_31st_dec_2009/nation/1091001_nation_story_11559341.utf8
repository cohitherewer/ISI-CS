The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | 2 festivals make Unesco list
                                                                                                               2 festivals make Unesco list
          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 30: Ramman, a religious festival and ritual theatre of Uttarakhand, and Navruz, the Parsi festival, have made it to the Unesco Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.        
	With these nominations, Indias representation in the Unesco list has gone up to five. At present there are three recognised heritage specimens  Ramlila, the traditional performance of Ramayan, Kutiyattam (Sanskrit theatre of Kerala) and the tradition of Vedic chanting  which have been included from India.        
	The culture ministry had submitted a list of 20 items, including Chatriyam music of Assam, Nacha folk dance of Chhattisgarh, Sankirtan dance of Manipur and the Veena tradition, to be included in the Unesco cultural heritage list.        
	The Unesco list has 180 representations from across the world. Getting representation in the Unesco list means international attention apart from handsome financial assistance from the organisation.        
	Ramman is held at Saloor Dungra village of Chamoli district of Uttarakhand annually. An endangered form, the festival is not performed at any other place in the Himalayas.        
	Navruz is celebrated on March 21 every year, a date originally determined by astronomical calculations. The festival is associated with various local traditions, such as the evocation of Jamshid, a mythological king of Iran, and tales and legends.               
	It marks the Parsi New Year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sena, BJP hit bump on seat in Konkan
                                                                                                               Sena, BJP hit bump on seat in Konkan
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 15: Seat-sharing talks between the BJP and the Shiv Sena have got mired in a dispute over one seat in the Konkan region, Guhagar.        
	The alliance had hoped to steal a lead over the Congress-NCP by announcing the names of its candidates much before nomination filing so that they could start work in the constituencies.        
	However, that did not happen after the Sena insisted that all the names should be announced simultaneously and not in bits and pieces and not unless a perfect understanding was reached on every seat.        
	Unlike the Congress and its ally, which are still engaged in brinkmanship over their entitlements and whether the formula should be grounded in the 2004 Assembly polls or the 2009 Lok Sabha results, the BJP agreed to play the junior partner and settle for the 2004 arrangement in which the Sena fought 171 and the BJP 117 seats.        
	The BJP even agreed to let the Sena have its way on the nature of the seats chosen, although sources said it made more political sense for the BJP to fight the cosmopolitan urban seats and field non-Marathi speaking candidates there to dilute the Senas Maharashtra for Marathi speakers campaign.

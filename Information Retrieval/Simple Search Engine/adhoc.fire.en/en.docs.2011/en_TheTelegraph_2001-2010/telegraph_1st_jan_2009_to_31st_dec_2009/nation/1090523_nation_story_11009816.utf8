The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sharad blames BJP bungle
                                                                                                               Sharad blames BJP bungle
  - NDA convener claims he warned Advani about hi-tech campaign        SANJAY K. JHA                          Sharad Yadav during the election campaign                                        
	New Delhi, May 22: Janata Dal (United) leader Sharad Yadav, who is also the NDA convener, has questioned the BJPs high-voltage campaign in an exclusive interview to The Telegraph.        
	He criticised the BJPs choice of poll issues and claimed that a simple majority for the Opposition alliance would have been possible with the right sort of campaign.        
	Without making any direct reference to the Gujarat chief minister, he appeared to disapprove of the decision to give so much importance to Narendra Modi during electioneering.         
	Yadav claimed that contrary to popular opinion, this UPA government would be much weaker than the previous one and might get discredited soon. Excerpts from the interview:              
	Q: Few in the NDA would have foreseen such a clear verdict in favour of the Congress. What went wrong?        
	A: We have called a meeting of our (JD-Us) national executive on May 30-31. We will analyse it there. We dont want to discuss things in the media.        
	Q: The BJP leaders are saying the verdict is a rejection of the third front and an indication that the country is moving towards a bipolar polity.        
	A: I dont agree at all. That is a wrong assessment.              
	Q: Leaders like L.K. Advani and key strategist Arun Jaitley have said so. They feel people have shown their distrust of smaller parties. Even Prakash Karat has said the third front idea didnt click. You dont agree with them?        
	A: Whoever has said so is wrong. This election neither signalled a revival of the Congress nor a rejection of smaller parties. The two big parties always fancy their dominance but the political realities dont bear them out. If you count the votes of the BJP and the Congress, and compare them with the votes polled by other parties, you will get the real picture. What has happened in Orissa and Bihar? And Tamil Nadu and UP? In the victory euphoria, the Congress should not ignore the truth.              
	Q: Many senior BJP leaders are raising questions about ideological issues and the direction in which the party should move now.        
	A: We dont comment on other parties internal matters.              
	Q: But as NDA convener, you would surely have analysed the deficiencies in the campaign?        
	A: Where was the NDA in the campaign? Did you see any NDA poster? The NDA broad-base was never highlighted. Except for the Ludhiana rally at the end, the NDA was non-existent.              
	Q: But you were the NDA convener and an important leader of the combine. You could have planned the campaign; why did you leave it to the BJP?        
	A: I told Advani and Rajnath (Singh) several times. I said the campaign was not happening in the proper way. They said Arun Jaitley was looking after it and we would talk to him. Nothing happened. We cannot dictate (to) the BJP; it is the bigger party.              
	Q: But what were the shortcomings? The projection of Narendra Modi? The defence of Varun Gandhi? The Advani-centric campaign, the indecent attack on the Prime Minister, or the over-emphasis on terrorism?        
	A: I told you, the NDA focus was not there. The farmer was the most important issue in this poll. Those who represent their interests, like Parkash Singh Badal (Punjab chief minister), (B.S.) Yeddyurappa (Karnataka chief minister), Rajnath Singh, Ajit Singh, Nitish Kumar and myself the farmer face of the NDA could have been projected collectively. The NDAs economic programmes could have been highlighted. Dont you think that would have given us the majority?              
	Q: Are you suggesting Jaitley bungled it? He chose all the wrong issues and presented them in a wrong manner?        
	A: I am not talking about individuals. The BJP is not a one-man party; they take collective decisions.              
	Q: Was the BJPs collective decision to project Modi and defend Varun suicidal?        
	A: I know you have come to trigger a fight within the NDA. You are using tricks to show conflict. You will not be successful. Dont talk personalities, talk issues.              
	Q: Tell us why the same campaign helped the NDA in Bihar.        
	A: No, the campaign in Bihar was in our hands. We did it differently. We highlighted the economic issues there. We focused on the poor. We have convinced the voters in Bihar that our alliance with the BJP is on an economic agenda, not a political agenda.              
	Q: What is the future of the NDA now?        
	A: We will concentrate on agriculture, equality and empowerment of the common people. We will expose this government in no time. The previous UPA government was stronger as it had the (support of the) Left with its 62 MPs, who were not driven by a hunger for power. They pressed the government for pro-people policies. Except for the N-deal, there was no major fight. This time, all power-hungry people have come together. They have already begun fighting. There is no mission in this government, except for sharing the fruits of power. This (the government) will not survive for long.              
	Q: Political observers said secular parties like the JD-U went with the BJP owing to Atal Bihari Vajpayees moderate leadership. But you merrily accepted Advani too. Are you going to accept Modis leadership now?        
	A: (Gets extremely angry): What is this question, why should I reply? This is irrelevant at this stage.

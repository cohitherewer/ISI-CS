The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Split: Bigamy and cruelty
                                                                                                               Split: Bigamy and cruelty
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, May 30: A man who marries again while living apart from his wife can be convicted of bigamy but not necessarily of cruelty, the Supreme Court has ruled.        
	A two-judge bench yesterday upheld the bigamy conviction of Manju Ram Kalita, an Assam resident, but acquitted him of charges of cruelty to his wife on the ground that the couple were living separately.        
	The trial court and Gauhati High Court had upheld both charges and sentenced Kalita to two years in jail for cruelty and three years for bigamy, the terms running concurrently.        
	Kalita, a government employee, had had a Hindu marriage with Minati Das in February 1992, the prosecution said. While seven months pregnant, Minati moved out and began living with her father, alleging mental and physical torture by Kalita. She gave birth to a boy on March 10, 1993.        
	In 1997, she came to know that Kalita had married another woman, Ranju Sarma, at a temple. She then filed an FIR under Sections 498A (cruelty) and 494 (bigamy) of the Indian Penal Code.        
	Kalita denied both charges but was convicted in December 1999. The high court dismissed his appeal in October 2000, and later rejected his revision petition.        
	At the Supreme Court, Kalitas counsel argued that the marriage with Ranju was not valid in procedure since it had been carried out only before a deity, and so bigamy charges could not be pressed. He also denied the torture charges.        
	However, the prosecution (Assam police) argued that all the lower courts had found the second marriage valid in procedure. The apex court declined to interfere with that finding.

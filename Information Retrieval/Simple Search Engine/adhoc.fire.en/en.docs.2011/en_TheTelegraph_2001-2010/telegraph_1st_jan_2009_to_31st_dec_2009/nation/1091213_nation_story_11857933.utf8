	Islamabad, Dec. 12 (Reuters): Seven Pakistanis suspected of involvement in last years Mumbai attacks have raised legal objections against their indictment on terrorism charges.        
	The objection postponed the commencement of the formal trial of the seven alleged militants linked to Lashkar-e-Toiba, the group India blames for the attacks that killed 166 people. The hearing was adjourned until December 19.        
	The suspects were indicted late last month but defence lawyer Khawaja Sultan challenged the indictment by an anti-terrorism court, saying it refused to record statements from prosecution witnesses.        
	We told the judge that this indictment was not based on charges framed by him but is based on those framed by a previous judge, Khawaja Sultan, the lawyer representing Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, a suspected mastermind of the attacks, told Reuters. We said this whole charge has become illegal.        
	He said that, under Pakistani law, the judge who issued the indictment should carry on with the case. Sultan said all seven suspects were present at the hearing, held behind closed doors in a prison in Rawalpindi.        
	Like India, Pakistan has a long and cumbersome legal process in which court cases take months, sometimes even years, to close.        
	Even if a case is settled in lower courts, it takes more time in higher courts to be processed if the decision is challenged in appeals.

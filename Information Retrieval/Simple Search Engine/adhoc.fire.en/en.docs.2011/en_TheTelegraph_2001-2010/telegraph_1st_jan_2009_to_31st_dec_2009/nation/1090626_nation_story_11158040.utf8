	Patna, June 25 (PTI): The month-long monsoon session of Bihar legislature slated to begin from tomorrow is likely to be stormy with the Opposition gearing up to corner the NDA government on alleged breakdown of the law and order and corruption in the state.        
	We are prepared to push the Nitish Kumar government towards a showdown. Breakdown in law and order, prevailing corruption in development and welfare schemes of central and state governments, will top our agenda, said the RJDs deputy leader in the Assembly, Shakeel Ahmed Khan.         
	Besides, he added, we will be putting pressure on the government for tabling the report on Land Reforms Commission and discrepancies in BPL lists.        
	Khan said his party would try to take other Opposition parties into confidence to present a unified show.        
	Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader in the House Ashok Kumar said the matter of floor co-ordination would be decided at a meeting of the state CLP tomorrow.        
	A meeting of leaders of all Opposition parties would be held tomorrow afternoon to list details of the failures to be raised inside and outside the Assembly, Singh said.        
	There is rampant corruption in implementation of the National Rural Employment Guaranteed Act, Indira Awas Yojana and allotment and distribution of rations among BPL beneficiaries, he said.        
	Leaders of all the three Left parties  CPM, CPI and CPI-ML(liberation)  will be meeting here tomorrow to formulate a common strategy to rake up the issues, said CPI-M MLAs Ramdeo Verma. Apart from law and order and corruption, the Left would also demand tabling of reports on Mahadalit Commission and Agriculture Commission in the House, he added.        
	Ruling JD(U) chief whip Shravan Kumar and BJP MLA Vinod Narayan Jha ridiculed the Opposition for its accusations against the government. We are prepared to take on the Oppositions onslaught, Kumar said.        
	They (Opposition) seems to have failed to digest their poll debacle in Bihar and therefore, they are trying to indulge in vilification campaign, he said. The session that will end on July 29 will have altogether 24 sittings, said the cabinet and co-ordination department principal secretary, Girish Shanker.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Chiru to quit after U-turns
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Chiru to quit after U-turns
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                                            
	Hyderabad, Dec. 16: Superstar Chiranjeevi tonight announced he would resign as MLA to show solidarity with the integrated Andhra campaign.         
	The stunning decision capped a day of somersaults by the actor, who had in the morning agreed to be part of the movement but then backed off, apparently prompted by the threat of a boycott of films involving him and his family in the Telangana region. I will support the Samaikya Andhra (Integrated) agitation in spite of threats to the film career of my son and other family members. If they want to attack me for being an artiste and a politician, so be it, Chiranjeevi said in a statement tonight.         
	Fourteen of the 18 MLAs from Chiranjeevis Praja Rajyam Party (PRP) have submitted their resignations to protest plans for the formation of Telangana.         
	With todays flip-flop, Chiranjeevi appears to have changed his stance for the second time in less than two weeks. On December 7, two days before the Centre declared it would initiate steps towards Telangana, the actor had told chief minister K. Rosaiah at an all party-meeting that he would support any resolution for statehood moved in the Assembly. The meeting was convened to contain protests triggered by the hunger strike of K. Chandrasekhar Rao, the Telangana Rashtra Samiti chief and statehood spearhead.        
	Chiranjeevi and his family are said to have already lost an estimated Rs 12 crore in the past two weeks because of the agitation in the Telangana region that has stalled releases and halted screenings.        
	The actor faced a near-mutiny after he declared earlier in the day that he would back the integrated Andhra campaign. His two MLAs from Telangana threatened to resign. PRP functionaries in all Telangana districts quit and announced protests that included a boycott of the films and film-based activities of the actor and that of his family. Most of the functionaries are film distributors.         
	Theatres in Warangal and Mahbubnagar said they would not screen films of Chiranjeevi or that of his actor-brother Pavan Kalyan or even his nephew Allu Arjun. Students at Osmania and Kaatiya universities declared a film boycott.        
	Chiranjeevi and son Ram Charan Teja are big draws in the Nizam circuit, the film industry term used for the 10 Telangana districts, including Hyderabad. Magadhira (featuring Chiranjeevis son) and Arya-2 (starring his nephew Allu Arjun) have been hit by the Telangana agitation.        
	Telangana protesters have already decided to boycott producers and artistes owing allegiance to the Telugu Desam, which opposes statehood.         
	In the Nizam districts, the box office collection from one show in a theatre is Rs 60,000 against Rs 20,000 in coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema, said Adisheshagiri Rao, former chairman of an Andhra film chamber.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Antibiotic hope to fight deadliest TB
                                                                                                               Antibiotic hope to fight deadliest TB
          G.S. MUDUR                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 27: Scientists have identified a combination of two known antibiotics that can kill bacteria causing extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis, kindling hopes of effective therapy against the deadliest form of TB.         
	Researchers at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, and the US National Institutes of Health have shown in laboratory experiments that the drugs meropenem and clavulanate can kill drug-susceptible, drug-resistant and XDR-TB germs.         
	Their results, published in the journal Science, suggest that this hitherto untested combination of antibiotics may be useful in the treatment of TB, particularly in XDR-TB that is now virtually untreatable.         
	Standard TB treatment uses a combination of four drugs, but inappropriate or irregular treatment has spawned multi-drug resistant TB, including XDR-TB.         
	Without effective therapy, death rates in XDR-TB are high  sometimes 100 per cent.         
	The move from the laboratory to clinical trials is likely to be much faster with the two antibiotics because they are already approved by drug regulators and already in use against other bacterial infections.         
	We hope to start a phase II (efficacy) trial in South Korea later this year, Clifton Barry, the chief of the TB research section at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and research team member told The Telegraph.         
	An entirely new drug would have had to pass through phase I (toxicity and safety) tests. But meropenem and clavulanate are approved even for paediatric use.         
	The findings emerge from research led by John Blanchard at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine who had earlier shown that clavulanate could inactivate an enzyme of the TB bacteria that allows it to evade an entire set of antibiotics called betalactams.         
	The new study has shown the concentrations at which the combination of the two antibiotics, meropenem and clavulanate, can wipe out TB bacteria in laboratory vials.         
	But some doctors caution there is no reason yet to celebrate. Meropenem is frightfully expensive  it could cost several thousand rupees a day, said Biswaroop Chatterjee, an expert in TB diagnosis at a hospital near Bilaspur. We also need a system in place to diagnose people with XDR.         
	Doctors also warn that the misuse or overuse of these antibiotics could also lead to the emergence of resistance against even these drugs.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Business row in RSP
                                                                                                               Business row in RSP
                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 25 (PTI): Veteran RSP leader Abani Roy has resigned from the primary membership of the party after facing criticism from colleagues for writing letters to the Prime Minister on issues involving business houses.        
	However, the party has not decided whether to accept the resignation of the 70-year-old Roy, a Rajya Sabha member. Roy said in Calcutta that he was ready to reconsider his resignation, if asked by the party.        
	Roy tendered his resignation on July 15, two days after he had written a letter to the Prime Minister opposing the merger of Bharti Telecom and South African telecom major MTN, alleging that it was a threat to Indias security.        
	Roy had also written a letter to the Prime Minister on the dispute between the Ambani brothers. Roys party colleagues have gone on record protesting the letters on business houses.        
	Roy, in his resignation letter, said that instead of conveying their protests through national dailies, the party should have seen the letters first from me and could have taken follow-up action, if any, including disciplinary action, against me.

                                                                                                               Telecast woes for IPL
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Mumbai, March 16: Dogged by security problems, the Indian Premier League has run into another controversy.        
	Bombay High Court has restrained IPL organisers from entering into an agreement with another broadcaster after Sony Entertainment Television dragged the league to court for ending its contract without notice.        
	Sony had moved the high court yesterday challenging the IPLs decision to terminate its contract and sign a fresh one with World Sports Group (WSG), an international sports broadcaster. The court restrained the IPL from signing any contract with WSG until the petition was heard.        
	The matter came up for hearing today but was adjourned till tomorrow after long submissions by lawyers Iqbal Chagla for Sony and Viraf Tulzapurkar for the IPL.        
	Sony and WSG had earlier won the rights for the IPLs national and international telecast, respectively, for 10 years against about $1 billion.        
	The IPL terminated the contract with Sony on March 14 and signed WSG Mauritius for the Indian telecast on March 15. Within hours, Sony moved court.        
	Lawyers for the IPL and Sony refused to speak to the media since the matter was in court, but league sources said the decision to end Sonys contract was a fallout of a previous controversy relating to Big TV, an Anil Ambani company, and Airtel Digital.        
	The controversy is also believed to have led to the exit of Sony chief executive officer Kunal Dasgupta.        
	Sources said Big TV had signed up with the IPL for an on-ground sponsorship of Rs 137 crore, but had pulled out after Sony signed a Rs 30-crore deal with rival Airtel Digital. The IPL governing council had then directed Sony to compensate the loss of Rs 137 crore, but sources said Sony had not paid up for its alleged ambush-marketing move.        
	IPL sources also alleged that Sony had violated the IPL guideline that match feed provided to news channels should not be longer than five minutes. IPL officials said Sony did not monitor this properly, allowing news channels to air footage of matches longer than five minutes.        
	Sources in Sony alleged that the IPL had not sent a notice before signing a fresh contract with WSG on March 15. IPL sources said the termination notice was faxed to the Sony office on the night of March 14,while the contract with WSG Mauritius was signed in the early hours of March 15.

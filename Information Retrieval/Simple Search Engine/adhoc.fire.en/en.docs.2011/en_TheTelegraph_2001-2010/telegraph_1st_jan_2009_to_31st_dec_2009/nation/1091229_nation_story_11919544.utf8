	New Delhi, Dec. 28: The Indian Navy has invited five global makers of combat planes, including the US-led F-35C Joint Strike Fighter, to participate in a competition for deck-based aircraft that it wants to buy.        
	Deck-based aircraft for navies have special requirements  like foldable wings because of limited space in carriers and ability for short/vertical take-off and landing.        
	Indias biggest military hardware supplier, Russia, which was asked for information on the Sukhoi-33, has opted out of the race saying it is phasing out the plane, a navy source told The Telegraph.         
	But Russia is negotiating with China to sell 50 Sukhoi-33 aircraft for the Chinese PLA Navys aircraft-carrier programme.        
	The first four of 12 Russian-made MiG 29K fighter aircraft contracted for the Indian Navy, however, reached India earlier this month. The aircraft are yet to be assembled because they were delivered in a knocked-down condition.                    A MiG 29K deck-based aircraft at an airshow      
	The MiG 29K are to be based on the INS Vikramaditya, as the Indian Navy has rechristened the Gorshkov carrier for which a re-negotiated price is yet to be contracted.        
	Essentially, the Indian Navy is now beginning to get the aircraft without the carrier to base them in. So it has fashioned an airstrip that is mimicking the Gorshkovs flying deck in the INS Hansa, the naval base in Goa, to induct the MiG 29K.         
	Among the five aircraft for which the Indian Navy has sent Requests for Information (RFI) are the F-18 Superhornet (made by Boeing for the US Navy), Eurofighter Typhoon (EADS supported by a European consortium) and Frances Dassault Aviation for the Rafale.         
	The Indian Navy had originally not sent an RFI to Swedens SAAB but the company expressed interest and was sent a request for the naval variant of the Gripen JAS 39.        
	The Superhornet, Eurofighter, Rafale and the Gripen are among six aircraft (the other two being the F-16 Super Viper and the MiG 35) contending for the biggest fighter aircraft competition going in the world today  the Indian Air Forces order for 126 medium multi-role combat aircraft that could be worth more than $12 billion.        
	The Indian Navys overt interest in the F-35C Lightning II is a bit of a surprise. The F-35C is the US Navy variant of the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF) programme being implemented by Lockheed Martin and is known in the aviation industry as the only fifth-generation aircraft.         
	The naval variant was rolled out of Lockheeds plant in Fort Worth, Texas, only in July this year. It is yet to be flight-tested.        
	Apart from the US, nine other countries are participating in developing the JSF  the UK, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Singapore and Turkey. India has separate agreements with Russia to co-develop a fifth generation fighter aircraft (FGFA) but that is nowhere near the stage of development that the JSF has reached.        
	The navy officer said the plan was to raise a squadron (between 16 and 20 aircraft) for the aircraft carrier that India is building on its own in Kochi (called IAC for Indigenous Aircraft Carrier). The IAC will be at least eight years in the making (2018).        
	The deck-based aircraft competition is being thrown open to global makers as a contingency measure because Indias own Tejas Light Combat Aircraft is inordinately delayed.        
	The Indian Navys only aircraft carrier, the INS Viraat, that sails with British vintage Sea Harrier aircraft onboard was refitted after being in the dry dock for nearly two years till November.         
	Its fleet of aircraft is also depleting fast with not enough back-ups. The navy now has less than a squadron-strength of the aircraft.

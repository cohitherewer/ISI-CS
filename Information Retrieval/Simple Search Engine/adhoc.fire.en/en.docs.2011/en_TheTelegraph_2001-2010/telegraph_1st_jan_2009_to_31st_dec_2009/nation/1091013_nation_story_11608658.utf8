The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Congress confident but not on big trophy   Party bent on foiling booster shot for BJP
                                                                                                               Congress confident but not on big trophy     Party bent on foiling booster shot for BJP
          SANJAY K. JHA                                                 
	New Delhi, Oct. 12: The Congress leadership hopes to deliver another body blow to the BJP by retaining power in three poll-bound states but Maharashtra remains its core concern hours before voting takes place tomorrow.        
	A consensus appeared to be taking shape among senior Congress leaders that reaching the half-way mark of 144 could be difficult and hence attempts to lure rebels, Independents and potential winners in the third front have already started.        
	The majority view is that the Congress-NCP combine will be in a better position to form the government, and the advantage of a favourable governor will ensure it gets a chance to sew up a simple majority.        
	The Congress is expected to spare no effort in rustling up the required numbers as a victory for the Opposition in the big state of Maharashtra could mean a booster shot for the BJP which is in the doldrums now.         
	The next battle is in Jharkhand where the BJP is in a strong position.        
	A Congress leader conceded that the fight was extremely tough in Maharashtra after a 10-year anti-incumbency but added: We still feel optimistic because the Shiv Sena-BJP campaign never lifted off the ground. The sickening fight between the two Thackeray brothers annoyed even their supporters.        
	Another factor that has bolstered the Congresss hopes is the perceived disenchantment of Gujarati and Marwari voters with the BJP because of the anti-outsider pitch raised by both the Sena and Raj Thackerays Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS).        
	The Congress leaders expect most of the non-Marathi votes, along with the bulk of Muslim votes, to help its candidates win close multi-cornered contests. We wont be surprised if a large number of our candidates win by less than 1,000 votes and the MNS gets restricted to below 10 seats despite cornering a significant vote share. Even the third front may not be able to touch the double digit, a senior Maharashtra leader said.        
	In Haryana, the level of confidence among the Congress leaders closely associated with the electoral process has come down even as others predicted a thumping victory.        
	The fragmented Opposition and the partys stunning performance in the May Lok Sabha elections prompted the Congress to dream of a smooth sailing but reports from the field suggest a closer fight.        
	A new factor that has injected a sense of worry is the possibility of Dalit votes getting transferred to Om Prakash Chautalas INLD following a secret understanding with Mayavati.        
	The Congress has solely relied on chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hoodas popularity. Hooda has tried to create an invincible fortress with the support of Jats who have traditionally voted for Chautala.        
	The project carries some risks, too, as it could alienate some sections that make up the Congresss rainbow coalition of non-Jats and Dalits.         
	A possible fallout was witnessed in the Lok Sabha elections: the BSPs vote share jumped to 12.09 per cent from 3.22 per cent in the last Assembly polls.

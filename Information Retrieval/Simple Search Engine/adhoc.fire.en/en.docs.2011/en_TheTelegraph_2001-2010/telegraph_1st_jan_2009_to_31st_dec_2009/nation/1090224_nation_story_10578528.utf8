The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mr Stone, you cant miss us now
                                                                                                               Mr Stone, you cant miss us now
          AMIT ROY                          Irrfan Khan in Los Angeles before the Oscar night                                  
	Los Angeles, Feb. 24: The prominence of Slumdog Millionaire will open India up to Hollywood and create many new opportunities for the Indian film industry, especially actors at ease with the English language, Irrfan Khan told The Telegraph in an exclusive interview in Los Angeles.        
	We are all on stage, the actor said, minutes after Slumdog had taken eight Oscars. It is unbelievable. Everyone is crying. It shows the power of cinema. I had a call from my wife. She is also crying.        
	Referring to the eight Oscars Richard Attenboroughs Gandhi bagged in 1982, Irrfan said: Gandhi was different. It did not have so many Indian technicians as this one. This will lead to greater collaboration between Hollywood and Bollywood.        
	Irrfan, who has established himself as one of Indias finest actors, said he believed Slumdog would usher in an age of enhanced collaboration between the worlds two biggest film industries.        
	The Oscars had represented a big moment for India, he said. This film might play a role so that Indians are accepted into mainstream Hollywood cinema the way they have accepted Spanish and Chinese actors into the mainstream. Yesterday, I met Oliver Stone and he said, Fantastic film. Immediately, I said, Did you see The Namesake?, and he said, No.        
	The way this film has been received, the way it is still becoming bigger and bigger, the way it is affecting the audience, all that is something quite unusual, he said, referring possibly to box-office takings headed towards the $100-million mark (against a budget of $15 million).         
	We had always known this was going to be an interesting, entertaining and important film because all the elements were there in the script. And from the way the director, Danny Boyle, was shooting, you could make out this film was going to make a noise. But that it would become so big nobody could have imagined. That is the magic of cinema.        
	The US and India have desired collaboration for a long time because the American and Indian markets are both big. They are gauging each other. This film will play a very crucial part in inspiring a lot of collaboration because Slumdog is, in a true sense, collaboration because you are using a sound recordist, first assistant director, co-director, background score and actors from India.        
	He underlined the commercial attractions of such collaboration. When a film becomes so popular, producers and studios want to capture that market.        
	He emphasised the high regard in which he held Boyle who had played a pivotal role in ensuring Slumdogs success. For me it was important to work with Danny. I have seen his work (such as Trainspotting). I long for directors whom I can trust and when I know I will get a surprise when I see the outcome of their shooting.        
	His view was that Dannys direction was very, very crucial; the way he was looking at the story, the way he was open to the different kinds of elements while shooting and constructing and when he was shaping it up.        
	Boyle was using Bollywood clichs but in his own way.         
	All these clichs we have seen in Hindi cinema, (for example) a person falls from a train and as he falls he grows up. All these things we have seen so many times but the way he has used them made the difference. Or the music of the film and the way he has used the song element. All that has made the film really special, even for international audiences. The film has done what it is supposed to do and the Oscars were the pinnacle.        
	As to whether Slumdog was a British or an Indian film, Irrfan replied carefully. As an actor, I would want not to be caged in one nationality. Definitely, there are a lot of Indian elements in it but the sensibility is not so much British as international. Danny Boyles sensibility is international.        
	He emphatically rejected the charge levelled by many Indians that Slumdog represented poverty porn.        
	I dont agree this is poverty porn as some Indians have alleged. Otherwise, every director in India would have been winning Oscars here if it was that simple. It is the way that Danny Boyle has made the film very intelligently, very sensibly, using elements of 1980s cinema  he has incorporated those elements. There is a context to the film. There is an intellect to the film which is there in the layering. On the surface it is a popular masala film  rags to riches. But there is so much going on underneath the film. For elite audiences, looking for finer nuances, it has so many things for them. It will inspire cinema students and upcoming film makers.              
	His explanation for some of the hostility that Slumdog has aroused among some Indians was that a certain percentage of Indian people, who are well to do and who travel around the world, felt hurt  why are they portraying such images of India? But this is not about India. India is incidental to the film.        
	He also advanced the argument: Whatever goes on in slums in India and in other departments is much more horrific than what is shown in this film. In all the areas, India has to take care of the system; there is so much more to do and slums exist. That is the harsh reality.        
	Irrfans personal signature is the understated role. However, he hastily pointed out: I have done over the top in Mahesh Bhatts films. Mahesh Bhatt always said, I want to spoon-feed the audience. Dont keep it to yourself. Say everything and say it loudly. I dont want good acting, Irrfan! I want ham, ham! Ham it for me. Aaysa foreign may nahi chalega, yaar.        
	After training from the National School of Drama, he had grown up watching and learning  just practising, trial and error  from such Hollywood films as Once Upon A Time in America, Traffic, The Godfather and Good, Bad and Ugly. We dont have any method for learning acting.        
	Irrfan outlined his philosophy which had been reinforced by the experience of working in Slumdog. Brando said great actors need great parts. I would add great actors need great parts but also great directors. To play an Al Pacino role in (an Indian version of) Godfather, I need a Ford Coppola for that.        
	Slumdog, he was sure, would help bring change to moviemaking in India. India is at an interesting transition stage when a new generation is coming, said Irrfan. Audiences have all seen Hollywood cinema. Earlier, we used to copy all these films from Hollywood  I have myself done two three copies of Hollywood films  but now if you copy everybody out there knows, This is from there, that is from there. But now a section of the metro audience is educated. Audiences are demanding better cinema.

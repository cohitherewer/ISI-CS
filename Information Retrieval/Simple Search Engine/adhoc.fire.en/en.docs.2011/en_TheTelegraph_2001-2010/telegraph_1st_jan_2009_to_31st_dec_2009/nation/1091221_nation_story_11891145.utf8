	New Delhi, Dec. 20: When the Lok Sabha was adjourned sine die three days ahead of schedule on Friday, it appeared to underscore how even the treasury benches can encourage unruly behaviour when it suits them.        
	The Opposition walked out accusing the government of engineering the Telangana turmoil in the House to get bill after bill passed without discussion.        
	Speaker Meira Kumar rued members growing taste for disruption rather than debate  on occasion, barely half-a-dozen MPs have forced adjournment on flimsy grounds and the Speaker has been defied repeatedly.        
	Meira feared this could render the democratic process ineffective and irrelevant. But she was silent on the governments role in maintaining order.        
	The parliamentary affairs minister and the Congress chief whip made no effort to rein in the partys MPs from Andhra Pradesh, who have been disrupting the Lok Sabha for three days.        
	While three bills were passed without discussion earlier last week when the Opposition was protesting the price rise, five were passed on Friday in a matter of minutes as the Speaker ignored the Oppositions vehement objections.        
	All BJP members walked out in protest against the passage of the bills amid the din. Mulayam Singh Yadav, Basudev Acharya, Sharad Yadav and Lalu Prasad pleaded with the Speaker not to let the government get away with this before they too walked out.        
	The minister of state for parliamentary affairs, V. Narayansamy, was seen walking up to the agitated Andhra MPs to persuade them to sit quietly  but only after the bills had been passed without discussion.        
	 In the last winter session, when Somnath Chaterjee was the Speaker, 12 bills were passed in two days, including eight in 17 minutes. Last years events were the more brazen because the government had brought in several bills after circulating a revised list of business in the afternoon.        
	CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta said the continuing ruckus over Telangana was a deliberate ploy by the government. The government could have called a meeting of all the parties but there was no such initiative by the leader of the House. The bills could have been sent to a select committee but the government was determined to skip the parliamentary process, he said.        
	Janata Dal (United) leader Sharad Yadav told The Telegraph: It was there for everybody to see that the ruling party members created a ruckus and the government used it to pass the bill without Parliaments consideration. The Telugu Desam had only four MPs shouting while no Opposition member was creating trouble. What happened is shameful and dangerous.        
	Congress leaders, however, denied that the Andhra MPs were protesting at the partys behest.

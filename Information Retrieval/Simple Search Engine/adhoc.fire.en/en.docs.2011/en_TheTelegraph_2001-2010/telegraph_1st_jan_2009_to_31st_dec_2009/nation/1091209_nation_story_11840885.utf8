          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       Advani during a BJP parliamentary party meeting on Tuesday. (PTI)                          
	New Delhi, Dec. 8: The government today said the Sangh parivar was solely responsible for the wanton, cold-blooded destruction of the Babri mosque but conceded that the Congress, too, had paid a price for a wrong political judgement.        
	Winding up a two-day acrimonious debate on the Liberhan commissions report in the Lok Sabha today, home minister P. Chidambaram said BJP leaders associated with the Ayodhya movement were responsible for the frenzy that led to the razing of the mosque.        
	He said the Liberhan commission  which probed the events leading to the December 6, 1992, demolition  had given enough evidence to prove that the act was a joint, common enterprise of the RSS, BJP, VHP, Bajrang Dal and the Shiv Sena.        
	The horrendous crime, Chidambaram added, has continued to divide our nation even today.        
	Slogan-shouting BJP members, protesting against a Congress MPs derogatory remark against Atal Bihari Vajpayee, tried to disrupt the ministers speech. Some even threw paper balls at Chidambaram for Beni Prasad Vermas use of the word neech (lowly), instead of little men used by the commission.        
	Despite the din, Chidambaram completed his reply after the Speaker had expunged the word from the records.        
	Chidambaram focused on the commissions findings and quoted extensively from the report to argue that the mosque was pulled down by trained Sangh parivar workers armed with hammers, axes, iron rods, shovels and ropes.         
	He said L.K. Advani had access to every information during the movement and asked the BJP to reveal what transpired at a meeting on the morning of December 6 where the now leader of Opposition and party colleague Murli Manohar Joshi were both present.        
	The BJP made false promises to the Supreme Court, to the National Integration Council and the Government of India with the sole intention of misleading the nation. Kalyan Singh, the then Uttar Pradesh chief minister, broke every single promise he made, Chidambaram said.        
	He conceded that the late P.V. Narasimha Rao, then at the helm of the Congress-ruled Centre, paid a price for making a wrong political judgement induced by false promises.        
	The Congress, too, paid a heavy price, he added.        
	Chidambaram said Advanis rath yatra was instrumental in creating the explosive situation. He said the charade of pleading with the kar sevaks to come down from the top of the mosques dome was in contradiction to the earlier conduct of the RSS and the BJP, and cited the slogan Ek dhakka aur do/Babri Masjid tor do. The slogan turned out to be the war cry to encourage the kar sevaks.        
	He quoted what Kalyan had said after the demolition  I fulfilled one of the major objectives of the party.        
	Chidambaram said the message from the debate was that the RSS and the BJP, which were inseparable, had no shame, no remorse.

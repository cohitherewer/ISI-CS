The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cash stalls freedom museum
                                                                                                               Cash stalls freedom museum
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 15: Independence didnt come cheap, but the government is reluctant to lavish funds it promised to spend to recreate the experience.         
	Sixty years after India won its hard-fought freedom from colonialism, it is struggling to provide resources to set up the countrys first museum, tentatively titled the Independence Experience, dedicated to that victory.         
	The government has not released adequate funds for the museum at Jamia Millia Islamia University, project organisers have complained.         
	Human resource development minister Arjun Singh had announced the project last year as an attempt to help the post-Independence generation rediscover the freedom struggle.         
	But Jamia authorities have accused the University Grants Commission of laxity in releasing the funds, blaming Indias higher education regulator for delays in the project.         
	At a crucial meeting of the steering committee, set up to monitor the project, on February 6, officials criticised the UGC for releasing only Rs 1.5 crore  only 2.5 per cent  of the promised Rs 60 crore.         
	UGC sources confirmed this and also accepted that the amount was inadequate to seriously start work on the museum.         
	The UGC works with a mechanism that requires organisations to show utilisation certificates for prior funds before release of fresh instalments. Sources said the organisers of the museum project had failed to submit any certificate.         
	But the UGC is likely to bypass this norm after Singh expressed displeasure at the tardy release of funds, ministry sources said. The minister, they said, was particularly interested in the project.         
	Singh heads a ministerial panel set up in 2007 to commemorate 150 years of Indias First War of Independence of 1857. The museum was also conceived by the panel.         
	In August 2008, Singh had laid the foundation stone for the museum, which aims to use audio-visual techniques to trawl from the Battle of Plassey in 1757 to Independence in 1947.         
	We have now decided that very soon we will release another instalment of between Rs 5 crore and Rs 6 crore, a top UGC official said.         
	But the amount is likely to prove inadequate in meeting the target of completing the museum by 2011, a top official involved in monitoring the project said.         
	When the museum was budgeted in the XIth Five Year Plan, the idea was that it should come up in 2011. But for the past six months since the foundation stone was laid, there has hardly been any movement on the project, the official said.         
	It was almost as though the government forgot about the project  hopefully they have woken up now.         
	The museum will aim to highlight the contribution of individuals and communities to the freedom struggle that have largely remained unrecognised.         
	The role of Dalit activists, minority communities and tribals in the fight against the colonial power will be exhibited in a special gallery, ministry sources said.

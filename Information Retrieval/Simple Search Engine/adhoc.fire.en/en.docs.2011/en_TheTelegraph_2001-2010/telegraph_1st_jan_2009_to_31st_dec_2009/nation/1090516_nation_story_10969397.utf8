The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rural retreat for Orissas senior citizens
                                                                                                               Rural retreat for Orissas senior citizens
  - Pipili Village dedicated to the elderly          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           Governor M.C. Bhandare                                        
	Bhubaneswar, May 15: A model village for senior citizens will soon be up and running at Pipili, along the Bhubaneswar-Puri road.        
	Jahuapur village at Pipili will house more than 100 senior citizens, who will be looked after by Kartaavya Foundation.         
	Post retirement, senior citizens have a lot of spare time and require a place and company to spend the rest of their lives, said Governor M.C. Bhandare, addressing the gathering at the launch of the project.        
	He urged more youths to come forth and take care of the needs of senior citizens and advised senior citizens to enlighten the younger generation with their vast experiences.        
	Orissa has 51 old-age homes of which three are state-run and remaining 47 are run by the Centre.         
	The state also has one day-care centre for senior citizens that is run by the IAS Wives Association.         
	Orissa stands eighth in the list of states having the highest number of senior citizens, with Kerala at the top of the list, followed by Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Goa and Pondicherry.        
	The 2001 census shows that of the total population in Orissa, 8 per cent are senior citizens (i.e. more than 60 years of age). However the percentage must have gone up by 10.5 per cent now, said social activist Rutuporna Mohanty speaking on the occasion.        
	Meanwhile, the police commissionerate has also extended a helping hand for the seniors. Like their women and childrens desk, the commissionerate will soon start senior citizen protection cells in at least 10 police stations.         
	These desks will be led by a sub-inspector, who will be responsible to keep a record of senior citizens in the area.         
	The record will contain details of the number of domestic helps and tenants who stay with aged people, said commissioner Bijay Sharma, adding that in the fist phase, the cells will be opened at Kaharvel Nagar, Chandrashekharpur, Saheed Nagar and Nayapalli.         
	This surveillance will reduce the vulnerability of this age group. We will also be counselling them on some important points such as not discussing money matters in front of domestic helps or keeping jewellery in locker, instead of the house said he.

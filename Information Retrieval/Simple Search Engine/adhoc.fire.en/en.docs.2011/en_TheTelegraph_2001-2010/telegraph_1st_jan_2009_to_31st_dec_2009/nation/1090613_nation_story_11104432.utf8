          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Ahmedabad, June 12: A teenager was today raped in a moving car that she and her boyfriend had been ordered into by a police inspectors son posing as policeman.        
	Sahid Sayyed, the school dropout son of an inspector, was out for a joyride in his fathers car with friends Tariq Sayyed and Abu Bakar Shaikh  all in their early twenties  when they spotted the teenagers cosying together under a bridge around 5.30am.         
	The 17-year-old girl, a student of Class XI and the niece of a well-known Surat sexologist, had met her boyfriend on way to her tuition classes that began at 6 in the morning before school.        
	Sahid approached the two posing as a police officer and asked them to get into his car. He told the couple they would be taken to the police station for questioning.        
	Scared and embarrassed at being caught out, they obeyed the orders and got in.         
	Soon after, the assault began as Sahid and one of his friends took turns at raping the girl without resistance from her friend, said Surat police commissioner Deepak Swaroop.         
	The cowering boyfriend was told to sit in the seat next to the third friend who was at the wheel.        
	After half-an-hour, the men dumped the two at the same place from where they were picked up.         
	The boy headed for school, while the girl went home. Initially she did not tell her parents anything when they asked why she hadnt gone to school.         
	When the girl went straight to the washroom to clean up, her mother followed her in and demanded an explanation. The girl then broke down and narrated the incident to her mother.         
	Her parents were supportive and they brought her to the police station to lodge the FIR, said Swaroop.         
	The girls boyfriend had noted down the number of the car which is registered in the name of the Sahids father, an Ahmedabad police inspector who was earlier posted in Surat.

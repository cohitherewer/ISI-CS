The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bachchan clears Slumdog air
                                                                                                               Bachchan clears Slumdog air
          RESHMI SENGUPTA                          Amitabh Bachchan in Jaipur on Friday. (Reuters)                                  
	Jaipur, Jan. 23: Celluloid  Amitabh Bachchan and Slumdog Millionaire  was the star on the third day of the DSC Jaipur Literature Festival.         
	If the launch of Bachchanalia by Bachchan drew the largest crowds during the day, a special screening of the Oscar-nominated Danny Boyle film was the buzz in the evening.         
	Bachchan was happy to address the 400-strong audience that filled the Diggi Palace lawns though the famous authors were missing.        
	The festival is touted as Asias biggest, with this edition hosting over 160 authors, including Vikram Seth, Vikas Swarup, Chetan Bhagat, Pico Iyer, Patrick French and Gulzar.        
	Look at the way Indian cinema has progressed. A book on films is being launched at a literary conference, beamed Bachchan, looking dapper in a pink shirt, black jacket and grey trousers.        
	Bachchanalia, a glossy hardcover tracing his career through film posters and publicity material compiled by Bhawana Somaaya, was the days pick despite its steep price of Rs 3,500.                        Pinky Sonkars hamlet is also in the Oscar spotlight but the seven-year-old (in picture) seemed blind to the recognition  until Smile Pinky director Megan Mylan called from the US on Thursday. The film is one of four nominated for an Academy Award in the short documentary category, Mylan told the Sonkars, triggering celebrations in the impoverished family in Uttar Pradeshs Mirzapur, near Varanasi. The film is based on the journey of little Pinky, mocked at and isolated because she was born with a cleft lip, from despair to hope after a surgery got her smiling      
	After a lot of cynicism, there is a greater acceptance of Indian cinema now. Slumdog Millionaire has won 10 Oscar nominations and I hope Mr A.R. Rahman will bring us another Oscar. I am terribly happy for Resul Pookutty, the sound engineer of Slumdog Millionaire, said Bachchan, before hurrying to clear the air on his remark about the Oscar hype over the Indo-British film.        
	I never said anything like that (that Oscars shouldnt be considered the ultimate recognition for artists). Some people had expressed their views on my blog and the media passed it off as mine. Slumdog Millionaire is a wonderful film. I saw it in Paris.        
	Slumdog author Vikas Swarup  his bestseller Q amp;A is now selling under the films title  arrived from the Mumbai premiere to introduce the film at the Jaipur screening.         
	Though Bachchan and Slumdog together stole the limelight, writers werent complaining. Wasnt his father a writer? said V.S. Naipuals biographer Patrick French, referring to poet Harivansh Rai Bachchan.         
	Travel writer Pico Iyer, whose session preceded Bachchans, was delighted to be sharing the limelight with him.

	New Delhi, Feb. 8: Sonia Gandhi today invoked Indira Gandhis legacy of liberating Bangladesh from Pakistan to reinforce that India would not compromise or capitulate before anybody in the war against terror.         
	Our inspiration is Indiraji, the Congress chief said in her inaugural address at the national convention of the partys district and block presidents.        
	The gathering at the Ram Leela ground kicked off the Congresss electioneering with the message that when it came to taking on terrorism, nobody, least of all the BJP, had the right to question the partys nationalist credentials and commitment because it had history, ideology and experience in its quiver.        
	On a day the BJP demanded sundering of ties with Pakistan and the recall of Indian diplomats and accused the UPA government of adopting a soft approach, Sonia matched its rhetoric word for word and declared that a party which lost two of its most beloved leaders in the hands of the terrorists does not need a certificate from anybody.        
	Two days after the 26/11 terrorists held Mumbai captive, Sonias daughter Priyanka Vadra had said her grandmother would have acted in a way that would have made all of us proud.         
	Priyankas remark was seen as advocating a hard line against Islamabad. The government and the Congresss statements that followed were variations of this until national security adviser M.K. Narayanan suggested on television that Pakistan was being co-operative in the investigations into the Mumbai attacks.        
	His statements were promptly scotched by the establishment.        
	Sonias address made it apparent that Narayanan, supposed to be her handpicked person, was out of depth with the Congress or the governments line.        
	I have said it before and I am saying it again that Indias patience should not be mistaken for weakness. Those across the border who are abetting terrorism, helping and encouraging it, will be answered befittingly, she said in Hindi.        
	Blasting the BJP for putting hurdles in the governments path, she claimed that unlike the Congress that was the voice of social justice, communal harmony and inclusiveness, that partys divisive agenda rendered futile its efforts to put down terrorism.         
	Only one party can fight terrorism, a party that gets the support and strength of every social section. The Congress alone is that party, she said.        
	When the Congress was in the Opposition, whether it was Kargil or Kandahar, the attack on Parliament or Jammus Raghunath temple or Akshardham, we never thought twice before supporting the NDA government. We did not want to make political capital out of such attacks, Sonia said.        
	But we cannot say the same of the BJP in the last five years. At every step they tried to fan communal sentiments. They stalled Parliament and deliberately tried to block important bills.        
	PM recovers         
	Doctors today removed all the surgery stitches on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who underwent a coronary bypass a fortnight back. They said he was leading a normal life and meeting officials.         
	His stitches have been opened. Some were removed yesterday evening while others were removed today around 11am. His condition is all right, the Prime Ministers personal physician Dr K.S. Reddy said.

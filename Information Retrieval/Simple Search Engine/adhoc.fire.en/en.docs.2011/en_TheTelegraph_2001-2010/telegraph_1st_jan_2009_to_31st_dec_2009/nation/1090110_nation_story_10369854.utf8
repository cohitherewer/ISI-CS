                                                                                                               Hike on, cry for more
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 9: Oil executives had been given a raise of 55-149 per cent just two months ago, the government has said, but wanted more.        
	A cabinet decision last November raised the pay package of entry-level officers  typically engineers and MBAs  by 55 per cent, from Rs 68,422 to Rs 1,06,134 a month. For chairmen, it was increased nearly 150 per cent, from Rs 1,21,014 to Rs 3,01,253.        
	Even before the boards of oil companies could approve the pay raise, executives went on a strike demanding 15 per cent more on average.        
	The oil executives dispute the figures and claim the actual increase works out to 17.84 per cent on average.        
	Performance-based pay, ranging from 40 per cent to 200 per cent of basic salary, is not a confirmed component and is tied to profits, which vary, the officers complain.        
	The figures showing their monthly emoluments also include provident fund and gratuity, which are paid at the end of service, they add.        
	Sushma Errevelles of Talisman Management Services, a human resource consulting firm that tracks executive salaries, believes oil officers have got a reasonably good deal at a time when private-sector hikes have been modest.        
	Compared to an average increase of 14 per cent for Corporate India last year, the hikes of PSU employees are reasonably good, Sushma said.        
	The executives are also unhappy with revisions that they say the government made to the Justice M.J. Rao Committees pay recommendations.        
	Indian Oil chairman Sarthak Behuria, writing as chairman of the Standing Conference of Public Enterprises to the secretary of the department of public enterprises, said bureaucrats had reduced the wage hike approved by the Rao committee. This had placed executives in a disadvantageous position.        
	ONGC chief R.S. Sharma had also suggested there was room for more when he wrote to the petroleum secretary last month seeking higher house rent and other allowances.

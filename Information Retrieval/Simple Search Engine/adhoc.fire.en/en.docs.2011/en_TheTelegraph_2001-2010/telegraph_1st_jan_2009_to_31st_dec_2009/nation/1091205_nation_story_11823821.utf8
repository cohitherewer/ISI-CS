          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec 4: The Supreme Court today directed the Centre to issue travel documents to enable a German couple to leave with twins born of an Indian surrogate mother, saying it would decide passport claims later.        
	The bench said the couple could come back to the court if they were not issued visas. The judges said they would deal with the complex question of whether the twins were entitled to Indian passports on January 15.        
	Jan Balaz and his wife Susane Lohle had arrived at an agreement in October 2007 with an Indian woman, Martha Immanuel Christy. She delivered the twins in 2008.         
	Since German laws do not recognise surrogacy, the couple applied and got Indian passports for the children that named Christy as the mother. But these were cancelled.         
	The couple moved Gujarat High Court, which held that Christy was their natural mother and told the authorities to issue them Indian passports with her name on them.         
	But the passport authorities challenged the decision in the Supreme Court saying it violated Indian laws of citizenship that either parent must be Indian. The Centre also said it would not be able to issue the passports and would go by a law commission report that said a surrogate mother should not have any right over the children.        
	The Centre and the passport authorities have named as parties Gujarats Anand municipality, where the twins were born. The municipality named Balazs wife as the mother in its birth certificates. But Balaz wanted Christy to be named as mother because Germany didnt recognise surrogacy. He has since relocated to England where surrogacy is recognised.

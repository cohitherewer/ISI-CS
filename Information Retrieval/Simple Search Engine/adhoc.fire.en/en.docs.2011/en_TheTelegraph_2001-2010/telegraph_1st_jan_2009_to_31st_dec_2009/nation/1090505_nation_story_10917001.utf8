The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Copter helpers in net, blame on labour row
                                                                                                               Copter helpers in net, blame on labour row
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          The arrested Airworks employees in Mumbai. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, May 4: Two employees of an aviation maintenance firm have been arrested for the alleged bid to sabotage industrialist Anil Ambanis helicopter, with police claiming the plot stemmed from a labour dispute and not corporate shenanigans.        
	Uday Warekar, 32, and Palraj Thevar, 38, worked as helpers with Airworks India Engineering Ltd, which serviced the Bell helicopters of the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG).         
	The duo, remanded in police custody till May 15, are members of the Maharashtra General Kamgar Mahasangh (MGKM), the recognised union at the aviation firm.        
	The arrests follow the discovery of seven peanut-sized pebbles and soil inside the gearbox of the Bell 412 helicopter in which Ambani was to fly on April 24 morning.        
	The probe took a dark twist last week with the death of Bharat Borge, the technician who discovered the gearbox garbage. The police ruled the death a suicide, but Borges family suspects foul play.        
	A senior pilot with Reliance Transport and Travels Ltd, part of the ADAG, had alleged that possible business rivals had plotted to kill Ambani by causing a mid-air crash. The directorate-general of civil aviation is investigating the claim.        
	Joint commissioner of police (crime) Rakesh Maria, however, said: This (corporate rivalry) might be their (ADAGs) perception, but our investigations show that the labour dispute between the union (MGKM) and the Airworks management was behind the spate of incidents at the Airworks hangar.        
	Maria said the chopper had been sent to the Airworks hangar for maintenance on April 22 evening, and was checked thoroughly by its engineers and technicians. Warekar, the police claimed, had inserted the pebbles and soil on April 23 morning when he and Thevar were assigned clean-up jobs as part of pre-flight maintenance.        
	Maria said the duo wanted to create problems for the Airworks management with whom their union has been fighting a case in the labour court since 1995. They knew the helicopter belonged to Ambani and (that their act) would get the management into trouble, he said.        
	Condemning the helpers malicious act, an Airworks statement said the company had initiated legal action against the duo.        
	Maria said at least four incidents of mischief relating to aircraft maintenance at the Airworks hangar, in which Warekar and Thevar had been named, had been reported in the recent past.        
	If convicted, the duo may face life terms.        
	Maria said Warekar and Thevar were not versed in the technical aspects of the helicopter, which was how Borge detected that something was amiss. The cap of the gearbox has an arrow which, if fitted correctly, should point in the opposite direction from the (nose of the) helicopter, but the cap was found facing the same direction as the chopper, Maria said. Borge played no role. His expertise detected the tampering.        
	A letter found on Borges body said he had seen some Airworks staff being slapped by the police. Warekar and Thevar later alleged they were slapped during questioning. Maria denied the allegation.

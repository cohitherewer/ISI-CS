          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, June 14: Reports of a late-night arrest in Dhaka set off speculation that Ulfa chief Paresh Barua had been taken into custody, but sources here said India was waiting for a photograph to arrive for verification.        
	Bangladesh police today dismissed reports of Baruas arrest in that countrys media as rubbish. Officials in Delhi, however, said that even if Barua were arrested, they would not expect Dhaka to confirm the news so soon.        
	Intelligence sources here said they hoped to receive a photograph of the arrested man, which would be compared with pictures of Barua in the possession of RAW and military intelligence.        
	(If the reports are found true), we will request extradition although we do not have an extradition treaty with Dhaka, a home ministry official said. There have been mistaken claims in the past of Baruas death or arrest.        
	According to unconfirmed reports from Dhaka, Barua was picked up from the citys Uttara area around 1am today, carrying a passport that had his photograph but gave his name as Shamsul Hussain. Assam polices database says Barua, who fled to Bangladesh in 1990, has been living there under various aliases, including Kamruj Zaman Khan.         
	The reports said Barua was picked up with five others  Pradip Brahma, Partha Chetia, Kantilal Chakma, Shyam Dev Barman and Prashant Pahari.

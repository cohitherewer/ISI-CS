          A STAFF REPORTER                           The mangled vehicle. (Eastern Projections)                                  
	Guwahati, July 13: An army colonel and his driver were killed in a suspected revenge strike by Bodo militants in Assams Sonitpur district today.         
	Colonel S.M. Perumal, 52, of the Army Medical Corps is the senior-most officer to be killed since August 1997 when a brigadier was gunned down in Assam, army sources said.         
	The blast came amid fears of strikes by the National Democratic Front of Boroland to avenge the recent killings of its cadres. About 43 NDFB militants have been killed between March 1 and June 30.         
	The explosion was so powerful that it flung the Maruti Gypsy in which Colonel Perumal and his driver Naik Ashwini Kumar were travelling about 20 metres away.        
	The engine was wrenched off the chassis and the vehicle reduced to a mangled mass of iron and steel. The blast left a crater about two meters wide and four feet deep.        
	The militants triggered the blast on a section of the highway passing through Chariduwar reserve forest in 11 Mile under Rangapara police station at 5.30am.         
	The site is 55km from Tezpur, the headquarters of the armys 4 Corps from where the two-vehicle convoy started this morning. The vehicles were about 80km from Tenga, the headquarters of 5 Mountain Division in Arunachal Pradesh, towards which it was headed.        
	Defence spokesperson Rajesh Kalia said the blast was triggered from near a bush about 30 metres away. Wires and 12 batteries were recovered from the spot.         
	He said five army personnel were travelling in an ambulance while the Gypsy, carrying the colonel and his driver, was ahead of it. The ambulance was unaffected.        
	The vehicles had been moving slowly since that stretch of the road was under repair. Boulders and sand were piled by the wayside. The militants took full advantage of the situation and planted the bomb right in the middle of the road without arousing any suspicion, Kalia said.         
	Colonel Perumal hailed from Secunderabad in Andhra Pradesh and is survived by his wife and two children. Naik Ashwini Kumar was from Bahadurgarh in Haryanas Rohtak district.        
	Army vehicles ply almost continuously on this road carrying troops to and from Arunachal Pradesh where there is heavy deployment of armed personnel to guard the Sino-Indian border.

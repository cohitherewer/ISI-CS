          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 8: If a Gandhi has campaigned for a non-Gandhi in a byelection for the first time in 30 years, there has to be a good reason. Firozabad is more than a prestige fight for the Congress.        
	A former BJP legislator may have been exaggerating only slightly when he said: If Raj Babbar wrests Firozabad from Dimple Yadav, you can rest assured that the Congress will sweep Uttar Pradesh in the next Assembly elections.        
	The Samajwadi Party, keen to ensure the victory of Mulayam Singh Yadavs daughter-in-law, had begun worrying when Rahul Gandhi arrived to campaign for Raj Babbar, a former Samajwadi leader and actor.        
	After yesterdays polling, the Samajwadis were cautious. Nothing can be said. Whoever wins will have a wafer-thin margin, a party source said.        
	The last time a Gandhi had campaigned for a bypoll candidate from outside the family was in 1978  and that had been a game-changing election.        
	In the Azamgarh Lok Sabha byelection, Indira Gandhi had personally handled the campaign of Mohsina Kidwai, then Uttar Pradesh unit president, after the Congress had scored a duck in the state in the 1977 Lok Sabha polls. Mohsinas victory paved the way for the Congresss return.        
	The Firozabad byelection may not be as loaded with political import as the 1988 Allahabad bypoll that V.P. Singh won after quitting the Congress, but sources across the states political divide see significance in it.        
	A Congress victory, many said, would suggest a weakening of the stranglehold of caste and community in elections in the state.        
	Babbars caste is unknown, hes probably a Punjabi, a Samajwadi source said. More important, it (a Congress victory) would prove that while the voters are still prepared to accept dynastic politics in the Congress, they may not tolerate it from the smaller parties where there are too many strong claimants, other than their so-called first families, to a share in power.        
	On paper, though, Dimple has the edge because the constituency has 3.5 lakh Yadav and 2.5 lakh Lodh-Rajput votes. The Samajwadis have not lost the seat in the past four parliamentary elections.        
	Close to Firozabad, Mulayam has tough battles on his hands in the Bharthana and Etawah Assembly seats, which fall in his fief.         
	In Bharthana, the Congress has fielded a former Mulayam loyalist who was passed up for a kinsman. In Etawah, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) has reworked the caste arithmetic in its favour.        
	In the 12 bypolls (11 Assembly and one parliamentary) in Uttar Pradesh, the Samajwadis stakes are the highest because they are contesting six.        
	The BJP too faces a stiff fight in Lucknow West, given up by Atal Bihari Vajpayees constituency minder Lalji Tandon after he was elected from the Lucknow Lok Sabha seat. Tandon, BJP sources said, was sulking because his nominee had been ignored.        
	The Congress, which lost narrowly from Lucknow in the Lok Sabha polls, is treating Lucknow West as No. 2 on the prestige stakes, after Firozabad.        
	Topping the BSPs most-wanted list is the Padrauna Assembly seat, which was held by central minister R.P.N. Singh whose family is close to the Gandhis. Singhs mother is contesting this time.        
	BSP sources said Mayavati was intent on winning this eastern Uttar Pradesh seat for her candidate, Swami Prasad Maurya, to avenge his defeats in the last Assembly and parliamentary elections.

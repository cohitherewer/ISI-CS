The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | In BJP borough, rivals drum beats louder
                                                                                                               In BJP borough, rivals drum beats louder

	Georai, Beed (Maharashtra), Oct. 7: Surrounded by a sea of drum-beating Nationalist Congress Party workers, a solitary three-wheeler monotonously relaying pre-recorded campaign messages for the BJP suddenly turned mute.        
	As passers-by looked at the driver of the BJP campaign vehicle quizzically, he signalled to his ear and shook his head. He had chosen not to challenge his loudspeaker to compete with the heavier and louder sounds of the Opposition group.        
	Poor chap (the campaign vehicle driver). The people he is campaigning for hardly come to the constituency and he is left to face the music, laughed Ganpat Ghule, a mausambi farmer sipping tea at a stall nearby.        
	In the Marathwada region of the state, the only visible signs of anti-incumbency ahead of the October 13 Assembly polls appear targeted at the BJP-Shiv Sena combine that has dominated politics here for over a decade.        
	A demoralised BJP, a confident Congress-NCP alliance and the arrival of rains in the nick of time for the cotton season are placing the saffron brigade on the defensive in its own stronghold here.        
	The BJP-Sena coalition may still pip its opponents here, but its margins may be less, in what would prove a setback to its efforts to return to power in Maharashtra after 10 years.        
	The region  consisting of Aurangabad, Jalna, Beed, Osmanabad, Latur, Parbhani, Hingoli and Nanded districts  has repeatedly returned verdicts tilted towards the BJP-Sena alliance even when it has been defeated elsewhere.        
	In the Assembly polls five years back, the combine won 26 of the 48 seats on offer here, with the Congress-NCP team  that won the state overall  winning only 19 seats in Marathwada.        
	Less than five months back, the saffron alliance won five of the eight Lok Sabha seats from the region, despite losing out overall in the state.        
	An aggressive campaign in Beed  constituency of Gopinath Munde, the BJPs best-known face in Maharashtra  proved the platform for the alliances success across Marathwada in the Lok Sabha polls.        
	A week before the Assembly polls, however, it was hard to spot BJP posters and flags even in Beed town.        
	There is certainly very little excitement among party workers this time. We will win in Marathwada, but no thanks to the campaigning, Rajesh Tawre, a local BJP leader in Georai conceded.        
	The Congress, which won just eight of the Assembly seats in Marathwada in 2004, is expecting to win around 14 this time, Keshavrao Autade, former MLA and the Aurangabad district Congress committee president, said.        
	Rains over the past week have also blunted the BJP-Sena combines efforts to utilise the poor monsoons to tap farmer anger against the state government and Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar who heads the NCP. Lush green fields greeted us as we ventured out of Aurangabad through Jalna and across the Godavari river into Beed.        
	Cotton is the principal crop grown in the Marathwada belt, though jowar, bajra, and some lentils are also cultivated here.        
	The cotton season starts in October and the crop is harvested in January.        
	Had the rains been delayed further, we would have suffered significantly. Now, there is no anger against the state government, Raju Thore, a cotton farmer in Raregaon village of Jalna district, said.

                                                                                                               Juice brawl turns fatal
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 28: A juice shop owner allegedly stabbed a customer to death last night for demanding that he be served when the stall was about to close.        
	Santosh Kumar, a 30-year-old property dealer and father of two young children, died on the spot.         
	Santosh had gone to Sai Juice Corner in the Khyala area of west Delhi and asked shop owner Arif Khan for a glass of orange juice at 10.30pm.         
	Arif refused to serve Santosh, saying he was closing the shop. Kumar allegedly saw some other customers being served at the same time and complained to Arif using abusive language. An argument followed.         
	Arif then allegedly whipped out a knife and stabbed Santosh several times in the chest and killed him.         
	He tried to run away but Santoshs brother chased him on a motorcycle and caught him. He was handed over to police.        
	Santosh was taken to a nearby hospital where he was declared brought dead.         
	The killing comes on the heels of another incident on August 17, when a 50-year-old man allegedly stabbed his wife to death after he found no water in the bathroom in his south-east Delhi home.         
	The accused had woken up in the wee hours and gone to the bathroom. Finding the buckets empty, he picked up a quarrel with his wife. Soon the scuffle took a violent turn and he killed his wife.

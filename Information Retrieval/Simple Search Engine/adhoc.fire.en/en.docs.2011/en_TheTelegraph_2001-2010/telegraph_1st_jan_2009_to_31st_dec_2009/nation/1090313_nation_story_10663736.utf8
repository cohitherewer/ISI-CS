										      CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                                
	New Delhi, March 12: Hunched over a file thick with applications, his brow knit in concentration, a bureaucrat at Shastri Bhavan tries to prioritise petitions, the fear of a Rs 25,000 fine for a delayed response plaguing his mind.        
	For years, the human resource development (HRD) ministry bureaucrat says, babus have unconsciously trained themselves to accept piles of petitions and then dispose of them, often without a single glance at their contents.        
	Now, several bureaucrats often spend over an hour a day just sifting through dozens of applications accompanied by covering notes marked in the top right corner by three underlined words: RTI Matter. Urgent.        
	The landmark Right to Information Act, 2005, has offered India a glimpse of what transparent governance can look like, tugging at the veil of obfuscation that protects information of basic public interest like a state secret.        
	But the absence of adequate teeth in the law, and the babus expertise in carefully obeying its wording while evading its spirit, continue to allow the frequent denial of legitimate demands for information.        
	Conceived by the now-dead National Advisory Council, and shepherded by UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi, the RTI Act was introduced in late 2005, replacing a significantly weaker Freedom of Information Act that the NDA had enacted.        
	Now, not only do we need to provide the information, but our response is time-bound. It is a source of tension, but I guess it is good for the nation, smiled the HRD ministry bureaucrat.        
	Most RTI applications need to be responded to within 30 days, though under difficult circumstances, the government body  called the public authority under the act  can seek 15 extra days.        
	The state information commission  the apex RTI arbiter where the state holds the information  or the central information commission (CIC), the nations RTI watchdog, can impose a fine of up to Rs 25,000 on the individual nodal official responsible for delay or denial of information.        
	The RTI Act has faced two serious attempts to limit its ambit. In 2007, the government considered bringing amendments to the law to exempt file notings  the scribbling on the columns of a file that often reveals the observations of officials about a process.        
	Last year, a parliamentary panel recommended amending the law to make it mandatory for applicants to justify their demand for information  and allowing the government to dismiss pleas not sufficiently well argued.        
	But the CIC, supported by civil society groups and activists such as Aruna Roy, deterred the government from moving any such amendments. (Roys successful experiment with the right to information in Rajasthan was the catalyst that propelled the introduction of the law.)        
	Under the leadership of Wajahat Habibullah, a retired bureaucrat and friend of the late Rajiv Gandhi  a photograph of the two of them riding horses adorns his office  the CIC has taken several decisions that have raised eyebrows in the government.        
	The CIC has made it mandatory for Indian missions abroad to accept RTI applications from Indian citizens overseas, bringing them under the scope of the act. It has repeatedly clarified that under the RTI Act, judges  including those of the Supreme Court  are public authorities and are therefore required to provide information.        
	The CIC is now deliberating on whether members of Parliament are public authorities and are covered by the RTI Act. The commission has also extended the ambit of the act to non-government bodies such as stock exchanges, which involve the use of public money.        
	But not all is well with the RTI Act and its implementation. While a Rs 25,000 fine may be adequate to get bureaucrats to reveal information they do not genuinely need to hide, critics argue it is a pittance for anyone involved in any significant scam.         
	An official  or the leadership of an entire organisation  may choose to pay the fine rather than reveal potentially explosive information.         
	Also, according to the CICs own statistics, the threat of the penalty is immediately used only in five per cent cases involving a delay or apparent denial of information. Commission officials argue that their job is to try and cajole public authorities into revealing information, not to punish them at the first possible instance and end the case.        
	But any reluctance to penalise can also breed quiet defiance, leading to the case being delayed and the appellant being denied one of the principal benefits of the RTI Act  not merely justice but time-bound justice.        
	After decades of secrecy surrounding the IIT entrance test, the RTI Act became the tool that uncovered large-scale irregularities in the 2006 admission exam, the first since the laws enactment.        
	Through the RTI Act, parents of students uncovered major discrepancies between cutoffs the IITs claimed to have used and the cutoffs they actually used.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Know your seat, Elder
                                                                                                               Know your seat, Elder
          JAYANTH JACOB                          Santosh Bagrodia                                  
	New Delhi, July 13: If you are an Elder fighting for the dignity of women subjected to virginity tests, just ensure that you know one thing: your place.        
	In Parliaments upper House, that is. For on those hallowed benches it seems one is identified by ones seat, not ones face!        
	Congress MP Santosh Bagrodia was today taken aback during zero hour when he began slamming the virginity tests reportedly carried out in Madhya Pradesh, but found his words provoking colleagues into loud peals of laughter.        
	The reason? The electronic display board had identified him as Tamil Nadu MP Jayanthi Natarajan, and some members were pointing to it and having a jolly good laugh at his revised gender and name.        
	Till Rajya Sabha chairperson K. Rahman Khan intervened, the merrymaking continued. How come Jayanthis name was being flashed when she was not even in the House, many kept asking.        
	Khan, who was in the Chair, explained that it wasnt the display board that had tripped. Rather, Bagrodia was sitting in the wrong place and speaking out of Jayanthis seat.        
	The Rajasthan MP was left with no option but to say he was happy that at least some systems in the country worked.        
	Soon after the fun and games, a ruckus broke out in the House as Congress and CPM members hit out at Shivraj Singh Chauhans kanyadaan scheme and the BJP stood up for it.        
	Bagrodia said the reported virginity tests were demeaning to women and an injustice against them. Action should be taken against whoever had ordered the tests, he added.        
	CPM politburo member Brinda Karat said the tests were an attack on the dignity and self-esteem of the girls being married under the Mukhya Mantri Kanyadaan Yojana.        
	BJP leader Najma Heptullah denied the tests had been held. The chief minister has denied any such incident. The deputy collector has given a report saying nothing of this sort happened.

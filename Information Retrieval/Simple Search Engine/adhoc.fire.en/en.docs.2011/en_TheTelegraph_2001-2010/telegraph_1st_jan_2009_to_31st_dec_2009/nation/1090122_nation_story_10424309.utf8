The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Manmohan undergoes angiography
                                                                                                               Manmohan undergoes angiography
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	New Delhi, Jan. 21: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh underwent a series of diagnostic tests over two days at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and is expected to be back at work in his South Block office on Thursday.        
	The tests included an angiography but doctors and his aides declined to say whether they had detected any blocks in his arteries.        
	The Prime Minister was likely to be discharged tonight, they said. Treatment procedures which have been recommended would be undertaken after a few days. During this period, the Prime Minister would resume his normal duties, a media release from the Prime Ministers Office said.        
	PMO sources scotched speculation that the investigations were carried out after the Prime Minister complained of chest pain. Its an annual exercise, he was due to go for the tests, a source said, adding that in 2006, nobody took note of the tests which were done just before he was hospitalised for a minor wrist surgery.        
	A senior doctor at AIIMS said the Prime Minister underwent blood tests, and an angiography was done between Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning. We have not done any therapeutic intervention (treatment), the doctor told The Telegraph.        
	An angiography is a diagnostic procedure that helps doctors observe the flow of flood through arteries and the heart and detect blockages. It involves inserting a thin, hollow tube called a catheter into an artery near the arm or the groin. A contrast material called a dye is injected to allow doctors to watch how the dye moves along with the blood through the arteries.        
	This test is usually done when patients have some symptoms, said a senior cardiologist who was not part of the AIIMS diagnostic team. Serious blockages in arteries may be treated either through an angioplasty or a bypass operation, doctors said. The choice of treatment depends on the location and the nature of the blockages. Some situations may not require such procedures.         
	In 2007, the Prime Minister was operated on for a benign enlargement of the prostate gland. He also had a cataract removed from his left eye that year.        
	The Prime Ministers current medical status fuelled speculation that a cabinet shuffle could be put on hold.

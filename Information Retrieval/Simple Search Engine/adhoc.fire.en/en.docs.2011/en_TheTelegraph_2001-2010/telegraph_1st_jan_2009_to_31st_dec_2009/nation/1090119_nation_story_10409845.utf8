The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Shuffle hint for   PF scam judges
                                                                                                               Shuffle hint for   PF scam judges
                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 18 (PTI): Some of the eight Allahabad High Court judges linked to the Ghaziabad provident fund scam may be transferred, Chief Justice of India K.G. Balakrishnan said today.        
	The CBI has made some preliminary inquiries. So we propose to transfer some judges. But no decision has been taken, he said.        
	The judge said the Rs 23-crore PF swindle was not really a judicial scam as it did not involve payments to influence court rulings.         
	It has nothing to do with corruption in the judiciary some judge accepting bribe or anything. Such allegations are not there. Financial defalcation is, of course, there.        
	The Ghaziabad scam, Balakrishnan said, involved money taken from the treasury by forging bills. Only it was a district judge who must have signed the bills.        
	The names of 34 judges have cropped up and some 80-85 persons are now arrayed as accused, he said.        
	Those who submitted PF applications for refund are arrayed as accused. (But) no judge is implicated as an accused. I am waiting for the final (CBI) report.        
	Investigations by Uttar Pradesh police had revealed the names of one Supreme Court judge, eight Allahabad High Court judges and 25 lower court judges and judicial officers, apart from those of some retired judges.        
	Balakrishnan rejected suggestions that the impeachment process had deterred the judiciary from taking tough action against higher court judges accused of graft. He said the process had been purposely made a little difficult to prevent harassment.

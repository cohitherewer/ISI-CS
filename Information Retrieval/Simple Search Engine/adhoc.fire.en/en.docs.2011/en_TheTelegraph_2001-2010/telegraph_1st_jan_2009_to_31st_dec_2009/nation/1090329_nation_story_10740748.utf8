The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Israel seals deal with song amp; dance
                                                                                     Israel seals deal with song amp; dance

	New Delhi, March 28: Investigations into a Rs 10,000-crore missile venture with Israel are revealing that Tel Aviv swung it by using companies known to use middlemen and peddlers of influence who produce cheesy videos of Bollywood-style item numbers (see graphic).  
	The joint venture aims to produce medium-range surface-to-air missiles (MR-SAMs) for Indian land forces. It was signed three days before the elections were announced.  
	The deal, being probed by the CBI and also being questioned by the Central Vigilance Commission, is disguised as a joint venture between the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and the Israeli governments Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI). Also involved is Israels interceptor missile maker, Rafael Armaments Development Company.  
	Former defence minister George Fernandes, former navy chief Admiral Sushil Kumar, and arms agents Suresh and Sanjeev Nanda are named in a first information report filed by the CBI in a separate deal in which the Indian Navy procured seven Barak ship missile defence systems from Rafael for $199.5 million and 200 missiles for $69.13 million in October 2000.   
	The CBI is investigating charges that commissions of 3.5 per cent were paid to middlemen.  
	For the MR-SAMs, IAI was contracted on February 27 (exactly a month back) but it has now told the Israeli media that it delayed announcement of the deal on a specific request from the Indian defence establishment because the customer (India) informed the company that early disclosure was liable to cause material difficulties in execution of the contract, and even result in its cancellation.  
	The company said it was announcing the deal now March 26  because the advance payment had been made, nearly a month after the contract was signed. Investigators are questioning a payment of $600 million on unspecified charges in the contract.  
	At its current value of $1.4 billion, the deal with the IAI outraces the Indo-Russian Brahmos to be the largest single arms joint venture between India and any foreign country.  
	It is set to make Israel the largest recipient of Indias defence payouts to a foreign country. This pole position has historically been held by Russia.  
	The IAI is the systems integrator for the Rs 10,000-crore MR-SAM project and Rafael is the interceptor-missile maker which will jointly collaborate with the DRDO.  
	Ironically, the joint venture will kill off the DRDOs homegrown Akash MR-SAM project that is being inducted by the Indian Air Force but which the Indian Army is not finding good enough despite a series of tests.  
	The IAF has placed orders for two squadrons, said a DRDO source but we do not understand why the army is sitting on its order for more than six months now. Sometimes they say the system is not agile enough, sometimes they say it is not mobile enough because it is on a tracked chassis (meaning it is mounted on a tank).  
	The MR-SAM built for the air force is a towed version. What is good for the Indian Air Force is not good enough for the Indian Army, the DRDO says.  
	But the Indian Army has made up its mind that what will definitely be good enough for it is the one on the drawing board with Israel.  
	Rafael has outsourced its marketing to a company named Elul Technologies  headed by David Kolitz, a former senior employee  whose Asia wing is also headed by the former chief of Rafaels Asia wing. Elul and Rafael are tapping into Indian expertise.  
	The expertise is offered by senior Indian Army and Indian Air Force officers who have retired recently and are networked with the bureaucracy of the defence establishment.  
	This information is available to the investigators who have been carrying on with their work despite the cabinet committee on security approving the joint venture in July 2007, defence ministry sources have told The Telegraph. The joint venture was contracted last month even as the run-up to the elections began.  
	The MR-SAM, for which the DRDO will give the brains, the IAI will take the brawn from Rafael and put the two together and sell to Indias land forces with item numbers thrown in, will not be in small numbers.  
	The Indian Army will take as many as nine squadrons of the MR-SAMs, each with a range of 70km or more for area air defence.  
	The package will include 10 command and control centres, 18 acquisition radars, 18 guidance radars, 54 launchers and 432 missiles.   
	Rafael, which is already supplying Spyder air defence systems (low-level, quick- reaction surface-to-air missiles) to the Indian Air Force, will corner a third of the revenues generated from the project.

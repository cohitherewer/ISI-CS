The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tribe name tweaked for quota
                                                                                                               Tribe name tweaked for quota
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Naveen Patnaik at the tribes advisory council meeting in Bhubaneswar on Friday                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 9: To appease the angry Kandha tribals in strife-torn Kandhamal district, the state-level tribes advisory council today recommended the Centre to incorporate the Kui Kandha term, replacing Kui in the Presidential Order, 2002.        
	After chairing the council meeting here this afternoon, chief minister Naveen Patnaik told reporters that the recommendation was made in order to remove certain confusion in respect of according reservation status to the Kandha tribals.        
	The recommendation of the council would be sent to the Union tribal affairs ministry for the modification of the Presidential Order, 2002, said a senior official of the SC/ST welfare department.        
	Earlier last month, the state government had proposed the council to delete Kui from the Presidential Order, 2002, as the particular word has been a major cause of ethnic conflict between Kandha tribes and Pana Christians in Kandhamal district for years.        
	The tribal-populated district had witnessed a major ethnic strife in early nineties and again in December 2007 over the issue. The Kandha tribals were peeved about the fact that some Dalit Christians had cornered reservation benefits, taking advantage of the Presidential Order, 2002, which enlists Kui as a tribal community.         
	According to the Presidential Order, 2002, Kui tribes are one of the 18 Kondh or Kandha tribes in the state. Following the proclamation of Presidential Order, 2002, Kui Janakalyan Samiti had moved Orissa High Court, claiming ST status for Pana Dalits on the plea that they were speaking Kui. Since then the Kandha tribes have been restive over the issue.        
	Officials said though Kui was a local dialect, it had been wrongly treated as a specific tribal group and got a place in the list of tribals in the Presidential Order, 2002. In Kandhamal, a large number of Dalit (Pana) Christians had managed to obtain ST certificate by claiming that they were Kui tribals since they speak the dialect.         
	Under the existing laws, a Dalit, after converting to Christianity, loses his SC status, whereas for tribals, the ST status is not affected after the religious conversion and he continues to enjoy the reservation benefits.        
	Since the Kandhamal riots, specially appointed vigilance inspectors have been investigating 593 cases of fake tribal certificates and most of them have been found to be false, officials said.         
	In this context, the government decided last month to initiate moves for deletion of Kui from the Presidential Order, 2002.

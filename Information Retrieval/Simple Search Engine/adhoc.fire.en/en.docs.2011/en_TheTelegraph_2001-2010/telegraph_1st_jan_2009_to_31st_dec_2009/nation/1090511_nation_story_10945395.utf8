                                                                                                               Minister buys liquor to reveal illicit sale
  - Chhattisgarh cops face showcause          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Raipur, May 10: In Chhattisgarh a cabinet minister broke decorum by purchasing liquor publicly to prove a point.        
	Home minister Nankiram Kanwar purchased five bottles of liquor from an authorised agent in Mahasamund village to contradict claims made by local police officers that they had checked sale of illicit liquor in the area.         
	Kanwar was visiting Saraipali in Mahasamund district, about 100km from Raipur, on a personal trip.        
	Upon his arrival he was received by Saraipali sub-divisional police officer J.S. Bhadoriya and station house officer (SHO) Chandrashekhar Dhruv.         
	When talk turned towards local problems, Kanwar quizzed officers regarding the action taken to check the sale of illicit liquor in the area.         
	Bhadoriya and Dhruv asserted that they had succeeded in curbing the menace, the minister, however, got contradictory feedback from the residents.         
	On his way back, Kanwar stopped at a roadside eatery and gave his driver Rs 500 to purchase liquor.         
	Since the minister was not in his official vehicle, the shopkeeper, who was not authorised to sell liquor, had no qualms in handing over the five bottles.        
	The minister immediately summoned Bhadoriya and Dhruv and handed the bottles over to them.         
	The officers who assured me wrongly will be served showcasue notices and if their explanation is found to be unsatisfactory, strict action will be taken against them, Kanwar said.        
	Such operations to stop sale of illicit liquor would continue warned the minister.         
	Kanwar is known for his crusades against illegal sale of liquor as representative in Korba district.         
	In 2002, Kanwar, who was then an MLA, was seriously injured when hired criminals of a local liquor contractor attacked him for his campaign against the illicit liquor.

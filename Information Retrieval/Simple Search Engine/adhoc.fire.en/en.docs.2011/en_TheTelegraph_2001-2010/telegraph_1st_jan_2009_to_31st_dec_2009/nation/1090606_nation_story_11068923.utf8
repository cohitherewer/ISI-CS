          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 5: Apprehending the possibility of terrorist attacks during the Puri rath yatra scheduled this month, Orissa police has urged the Indian Coast Guard to step up surveillance along the coast.         
	The threat perception stems from the fact that Puri is a tourist and pilgrimage town, which draws more than 10 lakh visitors from across the globe during the rath yatra.         
	Puri, a town along the Bay of Bengal, has a border as porous as Mumbai.         
	Orissa has a 480km coastline, along which several illegal settlements of Bangladeshi refugees have come up.         
	The vulnerability is maximum between Paradip and Gopalpur.         
	We have alerted the Coast Guard and requested them to step up surveillance, admitted director-general of police M.M. Praharaj today. The police has also intensified surveillance at Nolia Sahi  a fishermen settlement  and in hotels, said inspector-general (law amp; order), Arun Kumar Sarangi.        
	Anti-terrorist squads have been constituted, said the IG adding that bomb disposal squads with sniffer dogs are being kept ready.         
	Close circuit television cameras will also be installed at strategic points to keep a tab on the crowd, said the senior police officer.         
	Special security arrangements have also been made to prevent recurrence of any stampede.         
	Last year, six devotees, including three women, were killed and around 20 injured in a stampede.        
	Reportedly, the stampede occurred when thousands jostled to catch a closer glimpse of the deities while they were being taken in a procession.         
	There will be tight cordons around chariots and no one, not even VVIPS, would be allowed to go near the inner cordon, said Sarangi. Two companies of RAF and the newly raised Orissa Special Security Force will man the cordons.

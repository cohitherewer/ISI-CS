The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Consumer courts cant try exam boards
                                                                                                               Consumer courts cant try exam boards
  - Test authority not a service provider hired by students, clarifies SC           SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                                                Exam a Privilege          
	New Delhi, Sept. 12: Students cannot move consumer courts for compensation from education boards even in cases as serious as missing or mistaken mark sheets, the Supreme Court has held.        
	The board is not a service provider and a student who takes an examination is not a consumer, a two-judge bench said yesterday.        
	It explained that examinees do not hire a boards services  they pay the exam fee in return for the privilege of being able to take the public examination that the board was going to hold anyway.        
	The court had heard how a student, Rajesh Kumar, had lost a year after the Bihar School Examination Board failed to release his marks because of a mix-up involving roll numbers.        
	According to his complaint, two students were mistakenly allotted the same roll number, No. 496, in the Bihar Secondary School Examination, 1998. The centre superintendent then allotted roll number 496A to Rajesh and communicated this to the board office in Patna.        
	Rajeshs results were not published in spite of him writing several letters to the board, and he had to take the board examination again the following year. His father S.P. Sinha filed a case with the district consumer forum, Hazaribagh, demanding compensation from the board.        
	The board told the forum it had no jurisdiction in the matter since the complainant was not a consumer, as defined in Section 2(1)(d) of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. The forum, however, ordered it to pay the complainant Rs 12,000 with an interest of 12 per cent.        
	The boards appeal in the state consumer redressal commission, on the same ground that the student was not a consumer, was dismissed on September 9, 2002.        
	Another appeal to the National Consumer Commission was also dismissed on October 24, 2002. However, the apex court has eventually upheld the boards claim.        
	A consumer is a person who hires or avails himself or herself of any service for a consideration, the court said. However, when the board  a statutory authority established under the Bihar School Examination Board Act, 1952  conducted an examination in discharge of its statutory function, it did not offer its services to any candidate.        
	Students who took the examination did not hire the board or use its services for a consideration, the court said. Rather, they requested the board to test them and find out if they had imbibed sufficient knowledge to be certified as having completed the course; and if so, to determine their position, rank or competence vis--vis the other examinees.        
	The examination fee the students paid was not a consideration but a charge paid for the privilege of participating in the exam, the court said.        
	It added that any negligence, omission or deficiency in course of the conduct of the exam, or evaluation of answer scripts, or furnishing of mark sheets or certificates did not convert the board into a service provider. Nor did it convert the examinee into a consumer who could lodge a complaint under consumer laws.

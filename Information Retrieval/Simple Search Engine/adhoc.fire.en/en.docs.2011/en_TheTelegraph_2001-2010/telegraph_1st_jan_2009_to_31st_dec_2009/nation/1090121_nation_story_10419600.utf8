          OUR BUREAU                           Kalyan in Lucknow. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi/Lucknow, Jan. 20: On a day the BJP was licking its wounds after Kalyan Singh quit the party, the Congress decided to add insult to injury.        
	I have quit the BJP for life. I was feeling suffocated, said Kalyan, who was chief minister of Uttar Pradesh when the Babri Masjid was demolished. He accused the party of ignoring and humiliating him.        
	A couple of hours after the backward caste leader announced his exit in Lucknow, the Congress staged a big show in Delhi to welcome three former BJP MPs to its fold.         
	Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan, in charge of Karnataka, presented the three before an overcrowded news conference soon after they called on Sonia Gandhi at her residence. Rubbing salt in the BJPs wounds, enthusiastic Congress leaders said the new entrants were fed up with the BJPs work culture and communalism.        
	H.T. Sangliana, Manjunath Kunnur and Manorama Madhavraj, all from Karnataka, had voted for the Manmohan Singh government during the July trust vote and their joining the Congress was a foregone conclusion. But the coincidence with Kalyans exit prompted party leaders to discuss the contrasting moods in the two parties.         
	The BJP, whose party headquarters on Ashoka Road wore a gloomy look, is alive to the sudden drift in the party and hopes Kalyans would be the last such blow before the general election.         
	In Lucknow, Kalyan rubbished the partys poll chances, saying its tally would drop to five in Uttar Pradesh from 10 in 2004 and that it would not cross 118 seats nationwide. If by getting low marks, a student is deemed to have passed the examination, L.K. Advani can also be Prime Minister.        
	Kalyan, whose exit will hurt the BJP because he enjoys wide support in the Lodh community, also kept open the option of an understanding with the Samajwadi Party and said he was in touch with rebel BJP veteran Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, who has threatened to contest as an Independent.        
	Like Shekhawat, Kalyan too professed loyalty to Atal Bihari Vajpayee.        
	BJP sources said the leadership had decided to get tough with dissenters and send out a firm message that no one who blackmailed the party would be engaged in talks henceforth. The party now thinks it made a mistake by giving a Rajya Sabha ticket to Kusum Rai, a Kalyan confidante, to please him.

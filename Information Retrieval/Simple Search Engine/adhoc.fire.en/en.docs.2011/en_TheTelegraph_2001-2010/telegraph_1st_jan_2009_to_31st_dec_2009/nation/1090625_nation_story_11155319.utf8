	Bhubaneswar, June 24: Puri today saw a surge of 8 lakh devotees on its shores as the rath yatra of Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra rolled peacefully amid tight security in the pilgrim town.        
	Rituals involving the grand event passed off smoothly and ended before time said the chief administrator of the Jagannath temple, A.K. Meena, while talking to The Telegraph.         
	The main ritual, which involves pulling of the three chariots, began three hours before schedule.         
	Despite the high humidity and heat wave, frenzied devotees pulled the gigantic wooden chariots along the 3km Grand Road chanting haribol amid beating gongs and drums.        
	Elaborate security measures, including closed circuit television cameras, anti-terrorist squads and sniffer dogs, were spotted along the Grand Road that begins from Singhadwar, the main entrance to the Jagannath temple, and ends at Mausima temple.         
	There was tight security at bus stands and railway station, said inspector-general of police (law and order) Arun Kumar Sarangi. Quick Reaction Teams of the state police, comprising groups of trained commandos, were also deployed, besides bomb-disposal teams and armed rooftop watchers. Seventy platoons of armed police were also present in the town under the supervision of IG Sarangi.         
	Throughout the day, temple servitors were seen busy performing the plethora of colourful rituals that lends the festival its unique colour.        
	During pahandi bije in which the deities are brought out in a rhythmic manner began from the sanctum sanctorum of the 12th century shrine. Following that the three idols were installed atop three chariots  Taladhwaja, Devadalana and Nandighosha  parked in front of Singhadwar.         
	Pahandi bije was followed by chhera panhara (sweeping of the chariot floors with gold brooms) performed by Gajapati Maharaja of Puri, Dibyasingh Deb, considered as the principal sevak of the two lords and the lady.         
	Around 1pm came the ecstatic moment when the three chariots started to roll down the 3km Grand Road towards Mausima temple one after another, while a frenzied crowd cheered.         
	The three deities would return home after enjoying a nine-day retreat at Mausima temple.

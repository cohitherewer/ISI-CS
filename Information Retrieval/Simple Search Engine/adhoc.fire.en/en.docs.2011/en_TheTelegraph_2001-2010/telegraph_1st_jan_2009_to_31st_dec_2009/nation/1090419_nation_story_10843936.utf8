The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | THE A TO Z OF ELECTION 2009
                                                                                                               THE A TO Z OF ELECTION 2009
  - How the vocabulary was enriched by our leaders                                    A
    
	Allies  
	Lost and found: The Congress has lost Mulayam and found Mamata, Lalu Prasad has lost the Congress and found Mulayam, the BJP has lost Naveen Patnaik, Patnaik has found the Left...        B
        Babri  
	The demolition of the mosque  in Ayodhya 17 years ago is a  talking point again, after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said that was his challenger  L.K. Advani rsquo;s sole contribution      C
      
	Crores  
	Or hundred crores, the net worth  of many would-be MPs. Delhi rsquo;s Deepak Bharadwaj has Rs 622 crore; Gujarat rsquo;s Khimji Patadia  follows with Rs 514 crore; and many are worth Rs 100 crore and more       D
      
	Debut...  
	...that wasn rsquo;t. Sanjay Dutt needs a better scriptwriter than Amar Singh if Munnabhai is to be MP. All set to fight the Lucknow seat, he was reduced to campaigner when the Supreme Court said no      E
      
	Enough...  
	...is enough, the PM said, as he put on his boxing gloves and rained punches on lsquo;Iron Man rsquo;  Advani. It rsquo;s also what we rsquo;d like to tell the politicians slinging mud instead of fighting for issues        F
      
	Fronts  
	It has become fashionable to launch fronts, mocks Sonia Gandhi. Third front, fourth front, there can be many more coming, she says. But there rsquo;s no denying the Congress is worried        G
      
	Gudiya  
	One day the Congress is a  125-year-old budhiya (old woman) for Narendra Modi, the next day it is a gudiya (doll). So long as he can call the party names, the name doesn rsquo;t seem to matter        H
      
	Handloom  
	The poll uniform can be stylish, just look at Priyanka Gandhi in her bright cotton saris or mum Sonia in muter colours. For men, it's white kurta-pyjamas. Varun Gandhi prefers red though        I
      
	IPL  
	Cricket is big in India, but bigger than elections? Not a chance. The second season of the Indian Premier League clashed with  the polls, and had to retire hurt  to South Africa        J
      
	Jai Ho  
	The song won Oscars for  A.R. Rahman and Gulzar.  The Congress, which has  adopted it as poll anthem,  will be hoping it wins the party the crown of Delhi        K
      
	Kandahar  
	Like the Babri Masjid demolition, the Kandahar hijack has made  a comeback this election as an example of the BJP rsquo;s mdash; more specifically its then home minister Advani rsquo;s mdash; blunders in office        L
      
	Left  
	In 1996, it refused to join the  government and let Jyoti Basu become Prime Minister. In 2009, it seems to have had a change of heart. The Left doesn rsquo;t want to be left out of government any more        M
      
	Mistake  
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee admits he made one in Nandigram and that is the only one he regrets.  Is it a coincidence that  M stands also for Mamata,  his tormentor-in-chief?        N
      
	Never  
	When Priyanka Gandhi says  no to never, what does the  Congress hear? A lsquo;yes rsquo; to politics. So what if the young Gandhi has tired of repeating that politics is not what she would want to do        O
      
	Other  
	The other Gandhi, Varun, who rsquo;s gone to jail before he can go to Parliament. If cousin Rahul tells voters to ignore hate speeches, Varun stands accused of making one himself        P
      
	Prices  
	It looked like rising food prices would be the talking point, but then name-calling took over. Do the voters approve? Remember, onions and potatoes have felled governments in the past         Q
      
	Quit India  
	Another page from the past that rsquo;s come back to haunt a party, this time the CPM, which stands  accused of being on the ldquo;wrong side rdquo; of history, from Independence down to the nuclear deal         R
      
	Recession  
	Job losses and pay cuts have hit the aam aadmi. Recession has reached the ramp, as designers who charge a bomb for an outfit are talking of value for money. But politicians are R-proof. (See C)        S
      
	Shoe  
	If this election is about anything, it is about the power of the shoe that did what the courts could not: debar from the contest  the riot-tainted Jagdish Tytler  and Sajjan Kumar        T
      
	Team  
	Manmohan, Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka are playing as one,  defending and striking in concert. A designated captain and multiple leaders on the field is not for KKR alone, Congress is trying it out first        U
      
	Unattached  
	Single is in, and it's not just the  Independents Mallika Sarabhai, Meera Sanyal or Gopinath we rsquo;re talking of. Even the parties mdash;  Congress, BJD, BSP or ADMK mdash; want to go with few strings attached        V
      
	Voter cards  
	Electoral photo identity cards and poll rolls with photographs of voters are being used around the country for the first time. Assam, Nagaland and Jammu and  Kashmir are the only exceptions        W
      
	Weakest  
	Weakest PM is what Advani was calling Manmohan day in and day out. Till Manmohan tore into Advani rsquo;s claim of being strong and how. The BJP isn rsquo;t talking of weak versus strong anymore        X
      
	X-factor  
	The unknown quantity that  decides an election mdash; the pulse  of the people mdash; which pollsters  for all their caste arithmetic and  intricate calculations of swings usually cannot put their finger on        Y
      
	You  
	The voter, who this election  is all about, who with the  power of a finger will decide  who gets to rule the world rsquo;s largest democracy for the  next five years        Z
      
	Zzzz  
	Sleep is what politicians induce with the tired speeches low on substance and high on bombast they recycle every election. Sleep is also what the politicians won rsquo;t get till May 16, counting day

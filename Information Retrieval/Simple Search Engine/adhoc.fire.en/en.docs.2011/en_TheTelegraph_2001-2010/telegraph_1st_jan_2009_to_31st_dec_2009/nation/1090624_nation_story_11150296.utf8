                                                                                                               Warrant on Lashkar chief
                            
	Mumbai, June 23: The special court on the Mumbai attack today issued non-bailable warrants against Lashkar-e-Toiba chief Hafiz Mohammed Saeed and 21 other accused still at large, reports our special correspondent. The warrants will have to be executed through Interpol.         
	Pakistan, like India, is a member of Interpol, and the police there are under obligation to execute the warrants, special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam said.

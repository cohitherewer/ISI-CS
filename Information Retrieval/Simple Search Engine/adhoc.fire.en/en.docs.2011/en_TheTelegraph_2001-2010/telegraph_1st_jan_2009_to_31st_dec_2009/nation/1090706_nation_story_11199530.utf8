The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Mellow veteran to pen life story
                                                                                                               Mellow veteran to pen life story
                            
	Dharamsala (Himachal Pradesh), July 5 (PTI): An ailing veteran JD(U) leader George Fernandes today admitted that he was fed up with politics and was spending time penning his memoirs.         
	I am fed up with politics, said the 79-year-old former defence minister, who is undergoing traditional Tibetan treatment in the state for a brain clot.         
	I am spending my time writing a book of my journey, said Fernandes, who unsuccessfully contested parliamentary polls as an Independent from his traditional Muzaffarpur seat in Bihar after being denied a party ticket. The socialist leader said this would be his last book but did not say when the autobiography would hit the stands.        
	Asked if the book will have a reference to his socialist colleagues, particularly RJD chief Lalu Prasad and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, with whom his relationship soured recently, Fernandes said he did not want to wish to talk about the details.         
	The veteran, who is staying here since a fortnight on an invitation of his friend and Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, expressed dismay over the present brand of politics and said the country needed a young prime minister.         
	Politics is no longer a social service, it has become a business that is finishing the country, said the former NDA convenor.         
	India must have a young Prime Minister to take the nation to the top, he said.

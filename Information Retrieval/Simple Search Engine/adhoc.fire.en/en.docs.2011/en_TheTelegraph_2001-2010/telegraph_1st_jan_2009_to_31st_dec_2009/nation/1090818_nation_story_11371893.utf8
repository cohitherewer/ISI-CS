The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Transport official off ban hook 
                                                                                                               Transport official off ban hook 
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 17: The Supreme Court has held that a transport official will not be held responsible for any illegal vehicle on roads.        
	It struck down a part of a Punjab and Haryana High Court ruling that required a district transport official to pay 30 per cent of the compensation awarded to the family of a man who died in an accident involving a banned vehicle.        
	The ruling raises several worrying possibilities for Calcutta, where a transport official enforcing the high court-ordered ban on polluting vehicles, such as two-stroke autos, may cite the order as a precedent in case of an accident to claim he is not responsible.        
	In the case at hand, the man who died was riding a scooter that was hit by a kurkha, a motorised cart that is ubiquitous in rural Punjab.        
	An accident claims tribunal had awarded his heirs Rs 5.04 lakh. It directed that 70 per cent of the amount be recovered from the motorised cart driver and the rest from the Punjab government and its officials.         
	The high court upheld the compensation and said the transport department should deduct 30 per cent of the amount from the salary of the official on duty at the spot. But the apex court struck off the part asking the state to recover the money from the official.

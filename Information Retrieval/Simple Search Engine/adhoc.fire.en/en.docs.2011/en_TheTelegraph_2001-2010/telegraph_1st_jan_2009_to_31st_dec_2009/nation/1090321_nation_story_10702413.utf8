The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CPM Madhani snub to allies 
                                                                                                               CPM Madhani snub to allies 
          JOHN MARY                               
	Thiruvananthapuram, March 20: The CPM today kicked off a Left Democratic Front rally with the terror-tainted Abdul Nasser Madhanis Peoples Democratic Party, disregarding objections from other allies to such joint campaigns.         
	Kerala CPM boss Pinarayi Vijayan shared the front row with PDP working chairman Poonthura Siraj at the inauguration of CPM candidate A. Sampaths poll convention in the Attingal Lok Sabha constituency, near Thiruvananthapuram.        
	C. Divakaran, a top leader of the CPI, among the more vociferous of the Left allies against ties with the PDP, had to stomach the insult as he sat in the same row as Siraj.        
	Sirajs pride of place might have come at the expense of the RSP, an old Left ally, whose leaders were relegated to the back. The affront might have been greater given that the PDP isnt even a member of the front.        
	Siraj, though, didnt seem to feel out of place on the dais. Instead, he went on to deliver what appeared to be a back-handed compliment to the RSP by saying it is not such a small party after all since T.J. Chandrachoodan (its state heavyweight) is a leader of national stature.        
	Chandrachoodan, who is an all-India general secretary of the RSP, has dubbed the PDP more fundamentalist than the Muslim League. State CPI secretary V. Bhargavan had expressed his opposition to the PDPs presence on joint forums at a recent front meeting.        
	Siraj said Madhani would attend the Left convention in Ponnani  the seat that had been a bone of contention between the CPM and the CPI  tomorrow.         
	But its allies reservations seemed to make little difference to the CPM. Senior party leader and state finance minister T. M. Thomas Isaac told an election convention the CPM would not join hands with those who are out to hunt down Madhani.         
	Isaacs apparent defence of Madhani, acquitted after nine years in the case of the 1998 Coimbatore serial blasts targeting L.K. Advani, marks a turnaround from the CPMs earlier stand that the PDP was a communal party.        
	It was the CPM-led government that had booked Madhani over his inflammatory speeches threatening communal peace, and handed him over to Tamil Nadu police in the blasts case. Some other cases are still pending.

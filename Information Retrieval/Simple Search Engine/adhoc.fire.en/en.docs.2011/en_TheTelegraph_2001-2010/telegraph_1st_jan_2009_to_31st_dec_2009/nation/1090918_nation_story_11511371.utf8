	New Delhi, Sept. 17: Shashi Tharoors Twitter dig at austerity may have been easy to swat down but the Congresss ticket seekers from Haryana arent tweeting.        
	They are honking and roaring and running wild, crushing the austerity diktat under the wheels of their Pajeros, Scorpios and Sumos.        
	Thousands of ticket seekers and their supporters have laid siege to the Congress headquarters, 24 Akbar Road, for a week now. All parking space is taken up early in the morning by their 300-odd vehicles, and the canteen remains packed like a tin of sardines.        
	Each would-be candidate has brought hordes of supporters to impress the central leaders. Its the ticket seeker who takes care of the supporters board and lodging, with the bills running into lakhs. Some of the candidates have brought busloads of supporters.        
	There is no attempt to conceal the grand arrangements. If one candidate boasts of having ferried 50 people to the capital daily for the past one week, another claims his 25 supporters havent returned home for a fortnight. Money is no factor if they get the ticket, most of them admit.        
	Many of those loitering on the premises fiercely contest insinuations of wasteful expenditure. After all, they have virtually driven economy class in rickety Indica cars, and have been drinking canteen tea and eating rice and dal. So unlike the crowds brought in by the states MLAs and ministers who have been put up in posh hotels, get whisky to drink and butter chicken to eat.        
	There are thousands of them; you will not find any lobby of any five-star hotel in Delhi or Gurgaon empty, one former MLA claimed.        
	Hundreds of five-star hotel rooms have been occupied by ticket seekers from Haryana and Maharashtra. The Haryana and Maharashtra Bhavans too are packed.        
	Its difficult to find an aspiring candidate who is complaining about the expenditure. Those who are poor cannot fight elections. Even an Assembly election requires Rs 10 crore these days, a senior leader said.        
	Many leaders are willing to bribe the dalals (fixers) just to meet senior leaders. Some candidates have prepared glittering bio-data, each costing around Rs 500, like a wedding invitation card. Some are willing to pay crores to buy a ticket.        
	An aged lady, who accompanied a bevy of younger women to lobby for a leader, admitted she had nothing to do with politics. She had come to see Delhi, taking advantage of an offer of a free ride and free food.        
	The supporters either while away their time on the lawns of the party headquarters or on the street outside. They rarely get a chance to meet any senior leader. An appointment with a member of the AICC screening committee is a windfall, a close encounter with a general secretary a dream.        
	But all they get from the leaders is barely a minutes time and the customary assurances of help. The leaders know that such pressure tactics hardly ever fetch anyone a ticket.        
	These supporters, hired or genuine, lobby with senior leaders, shout slogans and display placards in support of their candidates. After the tickets are distributed, the disappointed ones throw stones and vandalise party offices.        
	Little wonder, therefore, that major parties like the Congress prefer to release their lists around midnight. After all, austerity or not, the damage must be minimised.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Oil strike in defiance of court
                                                                                                               Oil strike in defiance of court
                            
	New Delhi, Jan. 6 (PTI): Oil executives today threatened to defy court orders and strike work indefinitely from tomorrow even as the Centre said plans were in place to ensure fuel supplies were not hit.        
	Delhi High Court, which had on November 11 last year restrained Indian Oil Corporation officers from striking till the next hearing on February 6, today passed similar orders to Gail executives.        
	It issued notice to the officers union of the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation on a contempt petition by the company for giving a warning notice despite the court restraint. Guwahati High Court restrained officers of Oil India Ltd.        
	The Oil Sector Officers Association (OSOA), which is striking against anomalies in wage hikes approved in November, said it would not be deterred by court restrictions.        
	We are not bothered about that, OSOA president Amit Kumar said. No such notice has been issued to us and so we will strike work from 0600 hours tomorrow.        
	He said no talks had been planned with the government.        
	Petroleum secretary R.S. Pandey said operations at most refineries were unlikely to be affected by the strike. The ONGC and Oil India Ltd have said oil and gas output would not be impacted by the strike.        
	The OSOA has twice refused petroleum minister Murli Deoras invitation for talks and not attached much importance to a committee of ministers set up to resolve the wage hike issue.        
	Kumar said the petroleum ministry could raise basic pay, dearness allowance and house rent allowance, and separate risk pay from basic pay.        
	Deora appealed to the executives not to strike.        
	A strike in the oil sector can cripple the economy and cause severe hardship to citizens. All we want is that the economy should not be impacted and citizens are spared hardship.        
	Truckers strike        
	The nationwide truckers strike entered its second day today, making an impact only in the south so far. Prices of most goods remained stable.        
	The truckers strike has neither affected arrival nor the prices of vegetables and fruits, said J.K. Bansal, the chairman of the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee.        
	The truckers are striking for lower diesel prices and permit fees.

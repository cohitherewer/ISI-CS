                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Ashamed of 84 riots: Pranab
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                    Pranab                           
	New Delhi, Dec. 2: Pranab Mukherjee today said he felt ashamed of the 1984 anti-Sikh riots and described the violence as one of Indias most tragic events.        
	Every one of us is ashamed that it happened. We cannot get back lives that were lost. But we can certainly take a vow not to allow it to happen again, the finance minister and senior Congress leader told the Lok Sabha.        
	The expression of regret came over four years after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told the Rajya Sabha he had no hesitation in apologising for the mayhem in which thousands died.        
	Today, Mukherjee, the leader of the Lok Sabha, was responding to an emotional speech by Harsimrat Kaur Badal of the Shiromani Akali Dal questioning why none of those accused in the violence had been punished even after 25 years.        
	Harsimrat referred specifically to the Nanavati commission report, which had in 2005 recommended that cases be filed against Congress leader Sajjan Kumar and others accused of leading mobs during the violence in Delhi.        
	She questioned why the CBI had not yet filed a chargesheet against Kumar. If the government plans to give the widows or orphans of the riots justice, it should let us know. If not, then too let us know. Surely, we at least deserve an answer after 25 years,         
	Harsimrat said to desk-thumping support from all Opposition MPs and even Congress allies like the Trinamul Congress.        
	Delhi, Kanpur and other parts of the north had witnessed the riots, allegedly led by Congress leaders, for three days following the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards on October 31, 1984.         
	Leader of the Opposition L.K. Advani echoed Harsimrat, saying he could never forget what happened during those three days. None of us who saw before our eyes what happened those days can ever forget it. It was horrific.         
	The government, Advani proposed, should form an all-party panel to monitor the progress of cases against the riot accused.        
	Mukherjee said he would communicate the sentiments of the House to the Prime Minister  who had left earlier after attending the House for the first time this session  and to other ministers.         
	After Advani finished speaking, MPs from the BJP, Janata Dal (United), Shiv Sena, Akali Dal, CPI, CPM and the Samajwadi Party and Trinamul raised hands to support Harsimrats plea.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Controversy? Remain absent
                                                                                                               Controversy? Remain absent
  - Kashmir CM present in House only twice since sex scandal charge        MUZAFFAR RAINA                          Omar Abdullah: Staying away from trouble?                                        
	Srinagar, Aug. 25: Omar Abdullah, the angry young man of Kashmir politics, is also an absent young man. The third generation Abdullah, who, at 39, is one of the youngest chief ministers ever, is charting a new course: stay out of the Assembly to steer clear of controversies.         
	Where is the angry young man, is the refrain across the political spectrum after Harshdev Singh of the Panthers Party shouted these words at the treasury benches for Omars continued absence from the House.        
	Since July 28, when the Peoples Democratic Party dragged Omars name in the infamous 2006 sex scandal in the Assembly, the chief minister has been only twice to the House.         
	And has uttered precisely eight words: I rise to present Justice Jan Commission Report. The report pertains to the May Shopian rape and murder case, which was the starting point of the troubles dogging Omar who had a smooth journey since taking over as chief minister in January.        
	An incensed Omar had submitted a conditional resignation to governor N.N. Vohra following the PDP allegation. But what has surprised many is his continued absence in spite of being cleared by the governor and the CBI, which was investigating the case.        
	Omar could not be reached for comment but a close aide, who said he is not authorised to speak on record, claimed the chief minister has been using the time to travel to far off places like Gurez, Kargil, Drass, Ganderbal and Sopore. There was hardly a day that he didnt travel to places to redress grievances of people, the aide said.        
	But the Opposition parties have their knives out. The Panthers Party raked up the issue yesterday and was soon joined by legislators from some other parties.        
	Finance minister Abdul Rahim Rather said Omar had delegated him to speak on his behalf in the House, which did little to calm tempers.         
	Before the sex scandal controversy erupted, Omar did not miss any sitting in the session that began on July 25. He also had a reputation of being a good parliamentarian given his track record as an MP representing Srinagar three times. His speech during Manmohan Singhs vote of confidence last year won him many admirers.         
	So why is Omar avoiding a face-off with legislators this time? Sources close to him said it was part of a strategy to remain out of the spotlight.        
	Some men close to Omar have advised him against attending the session quite so often, the reason being that he attracts the limelight and becomes the focus of everything which has the potential of triggering more controversies, a source close to him said.         
	He is not just listening to advice from others, but he too is reluctant to join the House proceedings. He was shocked by the PDPs allegations and has still not recovered, the source added.        
	The chief minister, sources said, believes that the PDPs smear campaign was a below-the-belt attack.        
	He is partly hurt and partly disenchanted with how things have unfolded. He perhaps also does not want to be face to face with people who put him through this ordeal, the source said.        
	Omars close aide said the chief minister would attend the session tomorrow and participate in a debate on grants to his ministries.         
	He will personally answer the questions, the aide asserted.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Card of hope of a better future for child
                                                                                                               Card of hope of a better future for child
          ANANYA SENGUPTA IN NEW DELHI                          (From left) Sex workers Kanta, Babita, Nasreen and Praveena show their voter identity cards. Picture by Prem Singh                                  
	Nasreen Begum, 34, cant stop giggling. Holding her three-month-old baby in her arms, she runs her hand lovingly across a laminated card.        
	Nasreen is one of 1,300 sex workers from central Delhis red-light district who will vote for the first time in their lives. The voter identity card she proudly shows off to everyone, she believes, is the passport to a better future for her baby.        
	I finally have an identity as an Indian. Now I can send my child to school without facing harassment. Life will change; my destiny will change; what we say will also matter, Nasreen said.        
	A 500-metre stretch on G.B. Road is home to about 4,500 commercial sex workers in 21 buildings that house 116 kothas (brothels).        
	Living in cramped, rundown, dank, cabinet-size rooms, these women are excited about the election. This area with so many new voters has suddenly attracted the attention of politicians, who have been sending their aides down to these brothels to garner support.        
	We have been watching the campaigning on TV. We know about the hathiwalas (BSP), the kamal (BJP) and the haath (Congress), says Babita, 34. But till now no one has cared for us; no one has asked us what we want. This time we are closely following what these politicians have been doing for the people, and Well vote only for the candidate who we think will address our problems.        
	The sex workers top two demands are: get rid of the middlemen and build schools for our children.         
	I came here from Bangalore 16 years ago. I could then eat one roti a day but because of these middlemen, I now dont even have half a roti for myself and my children. All our money is eaten up by them, Nasreen said.        
	The women have to pay off four groups of people from the money they earn  the dalal (middleman or pimp who brings in the clients), the kotha owner, and police and the local goons who demand hafta (protection money). If any of the women has taken a loan, she has to pay the moneylender a high interest.        
	I know I will never walk out of G.B. Road, Nasreen said. When I didnt have anywhere to go, this stretch gave me a home, and now I cannot leave. But I want my child to have a good future.         
	She hopes that whoever is elected will ensure that women like her dont have to send their children away.         
	Babita, for instance, has sent her son off to Bangalore to live with relatives who do not know about her profession. Her daughter is a Class XII student in Delhi, but lives with another relative.        
	Iqbal Ahmed, the secretary of the Bharatia Patita Uddhar Sabha, an NGO working for sex workers rights, said some 3,000 of these women had applied for voter identity cards but only 1,300 appeared on the list.        
	The demand for their right to vote was first made in 1988. But before these elections, only the 300 kotha owners voted from this area. The main obstacle was that these owners did not want these women to vote; so they never allowed them to have any identity proof, said Khairati Lal Bhola, the NGOs founder.        
	It took us a long time to make them a part of the election process. We helped them open bank accounts and then used the bank documents to get them the ID cards. Some had ration cards, some dug up their birth certificates. It was a long and difficult process, but I am happy that they now have something to smile about.         
	Kanta, 42, fast approaching retirement age, doesnt smile too often. Women like her, who grow too old for the profession, return to their villages or somehow spend the rest of their lives at one corner of a brothel, doing odd jobs. So Kanta has her own demands. I want the government to give me pension when I retire, and build a hostel for women like us. I also want it to issue us licences so that no one can harass us. Only if all this happens shall I really believe that casting my vote has made a difference.        
	Come May 7, these women will put on their best clothes and, armed with their voter I-cards, walk down together to their polling station and vote in the hope of a better life.        
	 New Delhi votes on May 7

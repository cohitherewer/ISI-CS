The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Omar alert on cricket quiz 
                                                                                                               Omar alert on cricket quiz 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Srinagar, Oct. 19: Omar Abdullah today asked states across the country not to rub salt into Kashmiris wounds through acts like Saturdays questioning of J amp;K cricketer Parvez Rasool in Bangalore on terror suspicion.        
	It has been proven today that the fault was in the machine (bomb detector). The boy was unfortunately made the scapegoat, the chief minister said.        
	Parvez, 21, was detained for nearly six hours after a bomb detector at Bangalores Chinnaswamy Stadium apparently picked up signals suggesting there were traces of explosives in his kitbag. Officially, Bangalore police havent said anything about the detector being at fault, and Parvezs bag is being analysed at a forensic laboratory.        
	Omars stand contrasts with that of his father Farooq, a Union minister and state cricket chief. Farooq had said yesterday that some Kashmiris  perhaps players left out of the team or their acquaintances  may have given false leads to Bangalore police against Parvez.        
	The chief minister put the blame on the police. Incidents like these act as salt on the raw wounds of Kashmiris. I have always told the state governments Please take care when it comes to Kashmir, he said.        
	Omar said his government had swung into action as soon as reports of Parvezs detention reached Srinagar. Our DGP was in constant touch with Bangalore police. All the information was shared with Karnataka police, with the result that he (Parvez) was released immediately.        
	Omar urged his father to order an internal probe in the state cricket association to find out if anyone had played mischief.

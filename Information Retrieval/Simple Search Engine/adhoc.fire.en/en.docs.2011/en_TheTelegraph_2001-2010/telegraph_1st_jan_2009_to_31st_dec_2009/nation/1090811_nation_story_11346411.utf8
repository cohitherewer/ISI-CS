	Srinagar, Aug. 10: The Omar Abdullah government today promised Kashmiri Pandits 15,000 jobs, bringing the community that fled the Valley at the height of militancy closer to their dream of returning home.        
	The job pledge was made in the budget for 2009-10. Finance minister Abdul Rahim Rather said the promised employment would cover the government and the private sector.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, June 27: Students resorted to fresh agitation in Ravenshaw University today over the issue of inadequate number of teachers.        
	The students under the banner of All India Democratic Students Organisations Ravenshaw University Committee staged a dharna before the vice-chancellors office. They demanded an increase in the academic staff strength according to the University Grants Commissions 1:15 teacher-student ratio guideline.        
	Though the varsity has a student strength of 5,686, there are only 153 sanctioned posts. Of those, nearly 35 per cent have been lying vacant since November 15, 2006. We demand an increase in academic staff strength to 376 according to UGC guidelines, said Govinda Chandra Ray, the spokesperson of the committee.         
	The committee has also demanded a new hostel with a 500-bed capacity, he added.         
	With 20 departments and five other departments offering self-financing courses, there are just 13 sanctioned posts for professors. Of them, 11 are lying vacant. The university has been managing with guest faculty members against some of the 55 vacant posts, official sources said.        
	University registrar Satyakam Mishra said: The process for filling up the vacant posts is underway. Besides, efforts are on at the government level to increase the number of sanctioned posts.        
	Official sources said an ad for filling up all the 153 sanctioned posts was issued by the university in September 2008. But the scrutiny of applications is yet to be taken up.        
	Meanwhile, varsity authorities have decided to allow manual submission of applications from now. The online facility of application is also available on the university website.

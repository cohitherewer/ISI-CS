	Bhubaneswar, March 13: The deadlock over Wednesdays trust vote won by Naveen Patnaik continued today, with Opposition Congress leaders and BJP members reiterating their demand for the imposition of Presidents rule in the state.         
	Even as Governor M.C. Bhandare held discussions with the advocate-general, constitutional experts and the Opposition regarding the trust vote dispute, he failed to arrive at a decision.         
	In the evening, chief minister Naveen Patnaik had a brief talk with the governor regarding the dispute and handed over a letter to M.C. Bhandare.        
	Official sources said chief minister Naveen Patnaik was scheduled to meet the governor in the evening to apprise him of the situation. According to political pundits, the governor has three options  either to ask the government to go for a fresh trust vote, recommending Presidents rule or accept the Speakers words that the proceedings were legal and that the motion was adopted by a majority vote.         
	At todays meeting, Orissa PCC president K.P. Singhdeo reiterated his partys demand for Presidents rule to prevent horse-trading and ensure fair polls. The governor said the matter was complicated and that he is consulting experts to reach a decision, said Singhdeo.         
	Senior Congress leader and former Union minister of parliamentary affairs Srikant Jena said: We are opposed to a second vote. Its against the basic structure of the parliamentary democracy.        
	Speaker Kishor Kumar Mohanty and chief minister Naveen Patnaik, in the meantime, have continuously asserted that the Opposition did not demand a second vote after the voice vote.        
	Former leader of the Opposition J.B. Patnaik also met the governor today and spoke with him for an hour. However, the leader refused to divulge details. I met the governor to convey my best wishes for Holi, said he.         
	State BJP president Suresh Pujari said there was no provision for a second floor test. Only one option is now open before us  the governments dismissal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Handshake costs Nitish dear
                                                                                                               Handshake costs Nitish dear
          NALIN VERMA      
	Patna, May 12: Barely two days after his bonhomie with Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi, Nitish Kumar has found himself stripped of all recently acquired accolades that the Left and the Congress had heaped on him.        
	The next best thing for the Manmohan Singh government on Saturday became the squandering chief minister and a JD(U) leader with doubtful secular credential.         
	A letter from the Union home ministry arrived for the Bihar chief secretary on Saturday evening asking the ministry to return the Rs 1,000-crore grant, which Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had released as relief for the people in the Kosi belt in August 2008.         
	The letter alleged that the government had squandered the fund.         
	Based on a report placed by the accountant-general, officials at the Centre alleged that from April 2005 the Bihar government had a pending sum of Rs 554 crore with it in its calamity relief fund (CRF). The central team assessed that the Bihar government had spent Rs 497 crore on immediate relief out of that pending sum (Rs 554 crore) already pending with its CRF.         
	Thus, the government had either squandered the Rs 1,000 crore or kept it with them  thus the plea to return the sum.        
	In his defence, Nitish Kumar pointed out that according to the 11th Finance Commission recommendations, the Rs 554 crore pending in the state governments CRF became a part of the states consolidated fund in April 2005 itself.         
	The state then spent it on development and infrastructure building measures.         
	The Centre has no business to talk about the money that is there in a states consolidated fund, Nitish has said.        
	He added that the state had spent more than the Rs 1,000 crore (granted by the Prime Minister) on immediate relief, plus Rs 150 crore donated by several agencies.         
	However, the matter diffused a little after Prime minister Manmohan Singh called Nitish this afternoon and told him: We (the government of India) has recieved Bihar governments reply on the demand to return Rs 1,000 crore fund to the Centre. We are re-looking into the matter.         
	The Prime Ministers call has vindicated our stand on the issue. We have all along said that our government utilised the PM fund to its maximum capacity to help those marooned by the floods, Nitish said.        
	Though looking mollified, the chief minister reiterated his demand for the special package worth Rs 14,500 crore for rebuilding the region devastated by Kosi.         
	In reply to the Centres demand, Bihar chief secretary R.J.M. Pillai had yesterday written to the Union cabinet secretariat explaining how Bihar would not oblige the Centers demand and reminded the latter of its obligation to release a sum of Rs 14,500 crore for rehabilitation of the flood-hit regions.        
	Senior officials, who are not ready to be quoted, believe that the plea and statistical juggling has more to do with politics of bargain and blackmail in the run up to the government formation.         
	Why didnt the Centre not mention the money in the past 10 months and why now is the question that needs to be asked, said an official.         
	NDA leaders also suspect that the Centre is trying to lock Nitish Kumar in a hard bargain and is punishing him for sticking with the BJP in the run-up to the formation of the next government.        
	Manmohan Singh went to the extent of doubting Ntish Kumars secular credential in the wake of the latter shaking hands with Modi.         
	Even Nitish, drawing flak from Lalu and Paswan as well, seemed angered. An otherwise calm chief minister used stern language yesterday, asserting that Manmohan Singh is not the vice-chancellor of the university of secularism.        
	The Left that had recently discovered Nitish Kumar and tried to woo the JD(U) leader has fallen silent as well. And arch rivals Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan have begun to mildly reprimand Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi for failing to judge the Bihar chief minister.

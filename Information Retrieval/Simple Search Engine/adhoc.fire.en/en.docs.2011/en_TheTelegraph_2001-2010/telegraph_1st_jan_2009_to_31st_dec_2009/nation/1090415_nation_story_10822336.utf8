          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           In net: Ashok Sahu                                  
	Bhubaneswar, April 14: BJP candidate from Kandhamal parliamentary seat Ashok Sahu, accused of delivering a hate speech at a Raikia rally, was arrested from Phulbani today.         
	Talking to The Telegraph over the phone, Kandhamal superintendent of police S. Praveen Kumar said Sahu was taken into custody while he was leading a motorcycle rally in Kandhamal headquarters. He was booked under Section 153(A) of the IPC and Section 125 of Peoples Representation Act, Kumar added.         
	The leader was later forwarded to the court of Baliguda sub-divisional judicial magistrate and was remanded in judicial custody, as the court rejected his bail petition. However, Sahus arrest will not debar him from contesting, confirmed an officer at the state chief electoral office.        
	A criminal case was registered against Sahu on the night of April 10 at Raikia police station, after a local tehsildar filed an FIR accusing Sahu of delivering a hate speech at an election meeting on April 5.         
	Sahu, also the president of the state unit of Hindu Jagaran Samukshya (HJS), had allegedly accused the church of indulging in conversion and blamed a local parish council for plotting the murders of VHP leader Swami Laxamananda Saraswati and his associates on the night of August 23, 2008.         
	Yesterday, Raikia police conducted raids at a Phulbani hotel where Sahu was reportedly staying, but could not find him. Later in the night, Nayagarh police detained the leader for a few minutes and released him due to absence of an arrest warrant.         
	My arrest is a part of a conspiracy and I have been framed on false charges, Sahu, a former IPS officer, told reporters after his arrest. The voters of Kandhamal will give a befitting reply to this conspiracy, he added.         
	There was tension in Phulbani as supporters raised slogans. A unit of RAF and police were deployed in and around Baliguda court where Sahu was produced. BJP leaders in Bhubaneswar condemned the arrest as undemocratic.         
	Senior BJP leader and former law minister Biswa Bhusan Harichandan said the party would move the court against the arrest.

                                                                                                               Court nod to Ghandy   narco test
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Oct. 31: Alleged Maoist leader Khobad Ghandy will have to take a narco test unless he gets a superior court stay on a lower court decision today.        
	Ignoring his counsels opposition, chief metropolitan magistrate Kaveri Baweja ordered the narco test on Ghandy. Delhi police had sought the test saying Ghandy was not co-operating despite having thorough knowledge about the CPI (Maoist) .        
	The court accepted the police contention that a Delhi High Court judgment permitted narco tests in cases related to terror, conspiracy to murder and other serious offences where the investigators did not have any leads.        
	The high court judgment still holds the ground and has neither been challenged nor stayed till date, the court recorded. It also relied on a report by the AIIMS medical board that there was no evidence that Ghandy could not withstand a narco test. Ghandy suffers from a host of age-related ailments.        
	The court ignored Ghandy counsel Rebecca Johns plea that such tests couldnt be conducted on a person against his wishes.                          
	 and that the Supreme Court was yet to decide whether they were acceptable under the law.        
	The last high-profile suspects subjected to narco tests were Nithari accused Moninder Singh Pandher and his domestic help Surender Koli. Earlier, underworld don Abu Salem too underwent similar tests. Tapes of these tests were controversially aired on a news channel, creating an uproar among activists who said the tests violated the dignity of an individual.        
	But Rahul Mahajan escaped it, so did godmother Santokben Jadeja  only on the ground that the apex court was yet to decide on the legality of the tests. Mahajan got a high court stay. Jadeja got a stay from the Supreme Court.        
	The tests legality has been challenged in the apex court along with that of other invasive scientific tools such as finger-printing, brain-mapping and lie detector tests. Under Article 20(3) of the Constitution, no one can be forced to incriminate himself or be forced to depose against himself. The court concluded hearing arguments for and against such tests in January 2008, but is yet to deliver the judgment.

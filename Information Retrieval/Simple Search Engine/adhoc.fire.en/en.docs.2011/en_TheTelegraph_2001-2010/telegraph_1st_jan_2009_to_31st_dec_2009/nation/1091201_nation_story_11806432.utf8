	New Delhi, Nov. 30 (PTI): Two top army officers, military secretary Lt Gen Avadesh Prakash and deputy chief-designate Lt Gen P.K. Rath, face the prospect of disciplinary action as an internal probe into a land scam in Bengal has found them culpable.        
	Army sources said today that the court of inquiry, headed by Lt Gen K.T. Patnaik, indicted the two officers for their role in issuing a No-Objection Certificate to a private organisation that falsely claimed it was building an affiliate of the famed Ajmer-based Mayo College in Sukna, near Siliguri.        
	Lt Gen Prakash is one of the top eight generals in the headquarters acting as advisers to army chief General Deepak Kapoor. Prakash is responsible for promotion and postings of officers and the post is said to be a sought after one.        
	Lt Gen Rath was to go to the army headquarters as a principal officer to the chief, but his posting was kept in abeyance pending the probe.

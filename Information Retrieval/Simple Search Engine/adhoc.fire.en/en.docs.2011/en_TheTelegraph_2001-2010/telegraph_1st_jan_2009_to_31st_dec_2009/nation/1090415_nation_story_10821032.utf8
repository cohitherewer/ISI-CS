The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rift widens in Bihars first family
                                                                                                               Rift widens in Bihars first family
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Gopalganj (Bihar), April 14: First brother-in-law Sadhu Yadav, and now father-in-law Shivprasad Choudhary. The banner of revolt against railway minister and RJD boss Lalu Prasad in Gopalganj  home to the first family of Bihar  is growing longer.        
	Choudhary who is also the village panchayat head has joined the Congress and was seen campaigning for nominee Ramai Ram, pitted against RJDs Anil Kumar.         
	Reason: filial ties (his son recently joined the Congress). As the man himself said: I cant leave my son for the sake of my damaad and beti.         
	Shivprasad is often referred to as Dhritrashtra (a character both visually challenged and blinded by his love for his son). He seems an unlikely client to put up a strong fight against RJDs Anil Kumar, referred to as Bihars Shashi Tharoor by some for his grasp of the English language and international politics. Anil, the son of a first generation Dalit leader late Chandrika Ram, harboured dreams to become a civil servant and even cleared the 1985 civil services preliminary examination. Surprisingly, it was his education that prevented him from becoming an IAS officer.         
	It is said that when the interview boards chairman asked Anil if he was employed, he admitted that he was the Bhore MLA. He was elected in 1985. Reportedly, the board felt that educated members were few and far between in Bihars politics and thus persuaded him to remain in the arena for the sake of his people. The RJD nominee from Gopalganj has an elder brother in the Indian Foreign services and a younger IPS officer brother.        
	However, Anil Kumar did take the boards advice and decided to carry on with his fathers legacy, becoming a Rajya Sabha MP for two terms. He is still an MLA from Bhore  a Gopalganj Assembly segment.         
	Lalu Prasad remains unfazed by the anti-RJD campaign being carried on by his father-in-law and brother-in-law. Anil is perhaps the most educated candidate in whole of Bihar. Vote for Anil and ignore rabble-rousers like Sadhu and Shivprasad, was Lalus offer to his voters at a recent rally. With sharp political instinct, Lalu Prasad has handpicked Anil Kumar, an authority on Kafka, Bernard Shaw and T.S. Eliot, as a befitting reply to the likes of Sadhu and Shivprasad for voters who seem bored with the bullets for ballot system in the region. Lalus ploy seems to be working out among the so-called upper caste and elite voters, who otherwise do not favour RJDs lantern.

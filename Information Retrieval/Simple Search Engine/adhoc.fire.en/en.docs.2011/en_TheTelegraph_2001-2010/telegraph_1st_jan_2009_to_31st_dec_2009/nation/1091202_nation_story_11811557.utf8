The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Oops! Hijack scare in Mumbai
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Oops! Hijack scare in Mumbai
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Dec. 1: A pilot accidentally pressed the hijack button mid-air 10 nautical miles from Mumbai airport today, sending authorities into a tizzy, aviation sources said.        
	An hour and a lot of commotion later, Kingfishers Hong Kong-Mumbai flight, IT 072, landed safely with 151 passengers and a crew of 13 at 7pm. Both the pilots of the A330-200 have been de-rostered, a Kingfisher source said.        
	A top directorate-general of civil aviation (DGCA) source said the incident happened minutes before landing.        
	There was a radio failure just before landing and the pilot changed over from one frequency to another so he could communicate with air traffic control (ATC), the Kingfisher source said. The pilot wanted to intimate the ATC about the radio failure. The code for that is 7600. But by mistake he pressed 7500.        
	The source said the pilot immediately realised the error and got in touch with the ATC to clarify.        
	 But by then the ATC had panicked and set in motion the protocol to handle hijack situations. All security and other agencies including firefighters had been alerted, the airline source said. After the pilots clarification, the flight was cleared for landing.        
	A statement from Kingfisher spokesperson Prakash Mirpuri, however, said the hijack button was pressed accidentally by the crew after the plane had landed.         
	A DGCA official debunked the claim. Quizzed, the Kingfisher communications team said the statement was an initial response. The DGCA and the bureau of civil aviation security have ordered a probe.

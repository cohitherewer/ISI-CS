The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Plan to give benefits for learning disabilities
                                                                                                               Plan to give benefits for learning disabilities
          CITHARA PAUL                                          
	New Delhi, Oct. 11: The social welfare ministry has proposed that autism and learning disabilities be treated as disabilities under the Persons with Disability Act and special provisions be made for such children.        
	This is one of the suggestions in the proposed amendments to the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995.         
	The proposed changes, being circulated among stakeholders for suggestions, seek to achieve the ideals of the UN Convention on Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2006, a global benchmark.         
	The act now includes only seven disabilities  blindness, low vision, leprosy, hearing impairment, movement disabilities (such as in cerebral palsy), mental retardation and mental illness. Putting autism on the list will entitle such children to all the benefits available to the disabled.        
	The ministry has also proposed that the education of children with disabilities be made more inclusive in regular schools, through better facilities, instead of giving preference to special institutions. It has been suggested that special educators for the physically disabled be hired in all schools.        
	Distance education should be free up to the senior secondary stage (Class XII) for persons with disabilities irrespective of age, the ministry has suggested.        
	A proposal has also been made to introduce a special section in the act specifically for the education of children with cerebral palsy, multiple disabilities, and visual and hearing impairment.        
	Another change suggested is that the school evaluation system and curriculum should take into account the special requirements of visually impaired children. This could be done, for instance, by giving them more time to write exams and preferential grading.        
	The ministry has also suggested that 3 per cent of the seats be reserved for the disabled in all recognised institutions  government, government-aided and private.        
	In job reservations, already in force, the ministry wants more types of disabilities included in the list. A proposal has been put forward to split the 1 per cent quota for blindness among the blind and persons with low vision.         
	Another change suggested is that employers carry forward unfilled vacancies for three years against one year now so the disabled have more time to get the jobs.        
	The ministry has, however, proposed that the incentives  such as tax breaks  for hiring the disabled should be limited to private firms because government departments and the public sector are legally bound to employ such individuals. The Centres goal is that the disabled should make up 5 per cent of the work force.        
	The ministry has proposed adding a chapter, healthcare of the disabled, to the act to make legal provisions for free healthcare to those below the poverty line with special care for women.         
	The amendments also seek to provide maintenance allowance to persons with disabilities, especially to those with multiple disabilities, and women. An insurance scheme has also been suggested. Some definitions in the act will be changed to bring them in line with international standards.        
	Another chapter in the act is sought to be added making it mandatory for the government and local authorities to list the steps taken to ensure the rights of the disabled.         
	The rights include protection against discrimination, equal opportunities and access to education and jobs. The information will have to be posted in a way that suits the disabled.

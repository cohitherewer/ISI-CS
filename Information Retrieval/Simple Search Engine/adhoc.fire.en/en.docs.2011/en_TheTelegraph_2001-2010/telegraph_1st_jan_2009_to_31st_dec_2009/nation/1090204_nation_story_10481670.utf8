The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Arjun to scan PM panel
                                                                                                               Arjun to scan PM panel
  - Knowledge commission performance to be reviewed        CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                             Arjun, Manmohan                                       
	New Delhi, Feb. 3: The HRD ministry is preparing for a review of the National Knowledge Commission by the countrys top educational advisory body, barely two months before the tenure of the Prime Minister-appointed panel ends.        
	HRD minister Arjun Singh has reconstituted the Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE), after a year and a half in limbo, and the new team is meeting for the first time on February 10.        
	The board will find on its agenda the task of reviewing the performance of the commission, The Telegraph has learnt. The commission has had several spats with the HRD ministry since being set up in 2005 by Manmohan Singh.         
	A board sub-committee may even be set up to review the commissions performance in detail, a top official suggested.         
	The commissions term, already extended by six months, ends on April 2 but several of its recommendations are yet to be implemented. The government is yet to decide whether to extend the tenure further.        
	An adverse review report by the board would bolster the case for winding up the commission at the end of its term. We would like the CABE to review the knowledge commissions work over the past three years, a senior ministry official said, adding the review of the commission wasnt the only item on the boards agenda.        
	The CABE was first constituted in 1921 but kept in abeyance till 1935. From 1935 to 1994, the board met every year. It was discontinued till 2004, when Arjun revived it.         
	The knowledge commission and the ministry have disagreed on most key policy matters. The commission, headed by Sam Pitroda, has called for replacing the University Grants Commission and other higher education regulators with a body independent of government interference.        
	Last month, the commission opposed the ministrys move to push through an ordinance to start 15 new central universities, arguing the temporary legislative measure didnt grant the new varsities enough autonomy.        
	The tenure of the previous board team  three years under the boards constitution  ended in July 2007 but the government refrained from reconstituting it till now.        
	The board has always included four Lok Sabha and two Rajya Sabha MPs. The ministry was concerned that the newly appointed MPs may be deemed to be holding offices of profit.         
	An office of profit is defined as a second public office, in addition to membership of Parliament, that an MP holds. The Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Act, however, excludes certain posts from the definition but the boards membership isnt exempt.         
	But sources said the reconstituted CABE, headed by Arjun, did not include any MPs at present. We do not want a controversy just ahead of elections, an official said.         
	Officially, the board has been reconstituted on the directions of a parliamentary panel.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sangh offers BJP Hindutva legroom 
                                                                                                               Sangh offers BJP Hindutva legroom 
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat in Mathura on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 16: The RSS has told the BJP that while its core ideology was non-negotiable and had to be preached and practised by all its affiliates, the party was free to adapt and articulate it as it wanted.        
	But under no circumstances could it think of expunging the H (Hindutva) word from its dictionary.        
	Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi, not a Sangh admirer, was picked as a leader who straddled the space between ideology and governance without confrontation as were the other BJP chief ministers.        
	It is learnt that this message underlined the Sanghs preference for a regional leader to head the BJP when it was time for the present president, Rajnath Singh, to bow out rather than anoint one of the familiar names in Delhi.        
	The RSS recognises the difference between the BJP and the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP). The Sangh feels that while the VHP has the space to take positions that seemed extreme, the BJP was free to redefine, broadbase and repackage Hindutva to suit existing political circumstances.        
	Such a policy will help the BJP distance itself from the hawkish meaning usually read into the partys propagation of Ayodhya, a common civil code and the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir as its central issues.        
	At the two-day thinkers meeting of the Sangh parivar last week in Mumbai, the RSS brass, playing on the global concern over climate change, picked environment as an example to tell the world to look seriously at Hinduism and Jainism for answers instead of being tied down to the Judeo-Christian concept of a world created solely for mans benefit and rule.         
	Hinduism and Jainism, on the other hand, contain concepts that can lead to the enhancement of core human-earth relations because they suggest that the earth can be seen as a manifestation of the goddess who must be treated with respect, a source who attended the meeting said.        
	It is understood that some of the BJPs representatives at this exclusive meeting of 30 said environment would not fetch the party votes as a reaffirmation of its stand on pure nationalism.        
	The deliberations did not discuss the problems that have beset the BJP in Delhi. But it is believed that the talks on the sidelines over tea-breaks and meals confirmed that:        
	The RSS was unlikely to brook another debate on ideology versus governance, not as long as the BJP remained in the Opposition. It felt that the first priority was to regroup and re-motivate cadres. Ideology was the only cement.        
	The Sangh wondered if the polemics at the top in Delhi on the merits of Jinnah versus the de-merits of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel and Jinnahs secular garb were really substantive or meant for certain individuals to grandstand before a liberal audience and show up the Sangh as archaic.        
	The next party president and the leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha  assuming L.K. Advani gave up the post  would not necessarily be the putative PM candidate in 2014.        
	The thinking was that question could be settled in 2012 when Gujarat goes to polls. If Modi delivered a third victory, it might not throw him off the RSSs radar as it was assumed after his unspectacular showing in the Lok Sabha polls.        
	The Maharashtra elections would be a test for the BJP. Unlike in the last elections, when the Sangh didnt exert itself, this time around it is likely to canvass support for the BJP-Shiv Sena in its own way.        
	While it wished to ensure a graceful departure for Advani and even a post-retirement mentoring role, the RSS is apparently not going to be fazed by a bitter parting shot of the kind the leader gave when he stepped down as the BJP president in September 2005.

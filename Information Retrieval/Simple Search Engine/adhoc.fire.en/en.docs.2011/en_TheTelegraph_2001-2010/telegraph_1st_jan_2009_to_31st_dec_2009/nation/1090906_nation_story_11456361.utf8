	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 5: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik today requested teachers to take up teaching as a mission, and not as a mere profession.        
	Addressing a state-level teachers rally organised here to celebrate Teachers Day today, Naveen said the prime of objective of our educational system was to produce human resources and prepare children to face the challenges of the current era.        
	Highlighting the key role of teachers in the success of various educational schemes, the chief minister said the goal of free and compulsory education could be achieved with the active co-operation from the teachers.        
	Listing out the welfare measures for the teachers initiated by his government, Naveen said a career advancement policy had been implemented for parateachers. Besides, a revision of honorarium had been effected for parateachers and junior teachers.        
	Similarly, the cadre rule for elementary teachers has been amended to facilitate their promotion, he added. Special steps have been taken for promotion of education and literacy in tribal-dominated and backward areas, Naveen said.        
	For the promotion of literacy among tribal girls, the state government has set a target for establishing another 1,000 hostels this session.        
	The state government has enhanced the grant-in-aid to private schools from 40 per cent to 60 per cent, he said.                          
	Naveen felicitated Sumanta Sahu, a teacher of Unit-1 Government Boys High School as one of the ideal teachers. Leaders of the United Teachers and Employees Association, headed by BJD leader Bikram Burma, were also present.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Offer to open doors for NRI professionals
                                                                                                               Offer to open doors for NRI professionals
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Chennai/New Delhi, Jan. 8: The Centre indicated today that it plans to allow NRI architects, doctors, engineers and chartered accountants to practise in India, but professionals in these fields have questioned the wisdom of the proposal.         
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told a conference of NRIs in Chennai his government would make it possible for professionals holding Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) cards to practise here.         
	The two-year-old OCI scheme provides special cards granting unhindered entry and stay in India to all people of Indian origin who obtained foreign citizenship after 1950. The demand to permit OCI card holders to practise in India came from the American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (AAPI).         
	Most of us come here only for philanthropic work and not to make money. The present restriction that our expertise can be used just for a month in special medical camps is unfair not only to us but also to thousands of Indian patients looking for expert help, said Sudhir Parikh, one of the founders of AAPI.         
	But officials from regulatory authorities that govern these professions said India was not yet ready to accept NRIs. The Indian Medical Council Act allows only Indian citizens to be registered with the Medical Council of India.         
	Parliament would need to amend the law to allow NRIs to register and practise here, said Ved Prakash Mishra, a member of the executive committee of the MCI, the national body that grants doctors licences.         
	Top officials of regulatory bodies governing architecture and chartered accountancy have dubbed the proposal to allow NRIs unfair. In both professions, only Indian citizens can get licences to practise here.         
	Why should any foreign national be allowed to practise in India unless Indians also have equal opportunities to be employed in other countries on a reciprocal basis? asked Vijay Shrikrishna Sohoni, president of the Council of Architecture (CoA), New Delhi.         
	The CoA and the Institute of Chartered Accounts of India (ICAI) are working towards finalising agreements with corresponding agencies in several countries for reciprocal arrangements. These agreements would allow professionals equal opportunities in India and the other signatory countries.         
	We would be comfortable only with a reciprocal arrangement that allows foreigners to come here and Indians to practise abroad, said Prakash Mehta, chairman of the Abu Dhabi chapter of the ICAI.         
	Some doctors have questioned the benefits to India from the governments proposal. I think this is an inane proposal, said Biswaroop Chatterjee, a microbiologist working at the Jan Swasthya Sahyog, a rural hospital near Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh.         
	India has a glut of doctors in cities and a severe shortage in rural areas. I wonder how many NRI doctors would be willing to work in our villages, Chatterjee said.         
	Engineers in India do not need a licence. But NRIs holding foreign passports require time-bound work permits to work here. If the government acts on its proposal, NRI engineers with OCI cards will no longer need work permits.

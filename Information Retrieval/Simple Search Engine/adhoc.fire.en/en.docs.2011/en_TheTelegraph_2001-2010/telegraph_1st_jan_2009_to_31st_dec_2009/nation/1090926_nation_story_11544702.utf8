                                                                                                               Jaswant to stay in post: Speaker
          NALIN VERMA                              
	Patna, Sept. 25: Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar today ruled out the removal of expelled BJP leader Jaswant Singh as chairman of the Houses public accounts committee.        
	The rules of parliamentary business stipulate that he (Jaswant) can function on the post (PAC chairman) till he is qualified and fit to do so, the Speaker said, adding: Jaswant Singh will continue to function as the PAC chairman.        
	When pointed out that the BJP had asked for the removal of the Darjeeling MP as PAC chairman, Meira said: Parliament functions in accordance with its rules. All the parties have to work according to the rules laid to run the House.        
	The BJP had expelled Jaswant from the party following his praise of Pakistan founder M.A. Jinnah in his book.        
	It had also asked him to step down as PAC chairman because the party had recommended him for the post in his capacity as a BJP MP.        
	But Jaswant refused to step down. He told BJP leader Sushma Swaraj, who met him, that it was for the Speaker to decide.

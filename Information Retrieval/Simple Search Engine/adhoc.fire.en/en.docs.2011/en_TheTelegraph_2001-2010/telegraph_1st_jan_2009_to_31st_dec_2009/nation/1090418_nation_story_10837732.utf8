	Bhubaneswar, April 17: BJPs Kandhamal candidate Ashok Sahu, lodged in jail for his alleged hate speech, was granted bail by a Phulbani court today.         
	Phulbani district and sessions judge Jagajiban Patra ordered the bail on a bond of Rs 10,000 and surety, after hearing his petition, moved by counsel Debasish Panda. However, Sahu could not be released from jail today.         
	On Tuesday, Sahu was remanded to G-Udaygiri sub-jail for two weeks by the Baliguda court of sub-divisional judicial magistrate after his bail petition was rejected after his arrest.         
	Sahu was arrested while leading a motorcycle rally at Phulbani headquarters (Kandhamal) on April 14 and was booked under Section 153(A) of the IPC and Section 125 of Peoples Representation Act.         
	A criminal case was registered against him on April 10 at Raikia police station after a tehsildar filed an FIR accusing Sahu of delivering a provocative speech at an election meeting on April 5.         
	He is also under a Cuttack court scanner for holding a news meet where he blamed a Kandhamal parish council for plotting the murders of Swami Lakshmananda Saraswati and four of his associates in a Jalespeta ashram.        
	Sahu, is also the president of the state unit of Hindu Jagaran Samukshay, an aegis of the Sangh Parivar.        
	Meanwhile, the BJP nominee for Kandhamal could not cast his vote during the first phase of polls that was held yesterday.

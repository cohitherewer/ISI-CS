The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pawar in a fix over MP arrest
                                                                                                               Pawar in a fix over MP arrest
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                            Pawar, Patil                                 
	New Delhi, June 8: The CBI arrest of Nationalist Congress Party MP Padamsinh Patil on murder charges has deepened tensions between the NCP and ally Congress.        
	Embarrassed NCP leaders in both Maharashtra and New Delhi today appeared to be distancing the party from Patils arrest, but senior leaders said Sharad Pawar may not find it easy to seek the Osmanabad MPs resignation.         
	Action against Patil, once one of Pawars closest aides, could anger party workers who are arguing that the arrest represents Congress blackmail, NCP sources said.         
	Failure to act against Patil could,on the other hand, jeopardise Pawars relations with a central Congress leadership keen to flaunt its political cleanliness, the sources said.         
	It is a tough choice for Pawar, and either option he chooses could have unpleasant repercussions, a close aide of the NCP boss said.         
	Sections of the Maharashtra Congress have internally started citing Patils arrest as an embarrassment for the state government, which their party runs in alliance with the NCP, ahead of Assembly polls in October.         
	These Congress sources are hinting at plans to use Patils arrest as their latest argument to break ties with the NCP, further fuelling existing tensions between workers of the two parties in the state.         
	Today, the Maharashtra Assembly was rocked by demands from the Opposition BJP-Shiv Sena combine for the resignation of home minister Jayant Patil of the NCP.         
	The state police had been accused earlier of acting under pressure to let off Patil, leading to the CBI taking over the case. Patil is accused of the 2006 murder of his cousin, Congress leader Pawanraje Nimbalkar, and his driver.         
	There were no serious attempts in the Assembly today by the Congress to assist us in tackling the Opposition . It is clear that many in the Congress are quite happy with Patils arrest, an angry NCP leader from Satara in western Maharashtra said.         
	Sections in the Congress have already stated that they want their party to sever ties with the NCP and contest the Assembly polls alone.         
	Some Congress leaders have also questioned the rationale behind the NCPs separate identity now that Pawars party has accepted Sonia Gandhi as the leader of the UPA  burying its opposition to her foreign origins.         
	Patils arrest is clearly the latest attempt to put pressure on the NCP to either merge with the Congress or face a breakdown of the alliance, the Satara leader claimed.         
	The growing tension between workers of the Congress and the NCP in the state mean that Pawars moves on the Patil case will be scrutinised by his partys rank and file closely, sources said.         
	NCP leaders Praful Patel and Govindrao Adik  in Delhi and Mumbai, respectively  today independently called the case a matter between Patil and the CBI, suggesting that the party was distancing itself from its MP.         
	But Patil is the NCPs face in the Marathwada region of the state where the BJP-Shiv Sena combine has been dominant for several years now.         
	And alienating or upsetting Patil and his supporters  just ahead of Assembly polls where the Congress-NCP alliance faces 10 years of anti-incumbency  could hurt Pawars party at least in the short run, sources said.         
	One cant rule out the spread of dissatisfaction with the leadership to other parts of the state too, if Pawar does not stand by Patil at this time, a source said.         
	But any move to openly support Patil could be seen as questioning the CBI, and by extension, the Congress-led central government. Such a scenario would make the NCP-Congress alliance extremely wobbly, an NCP leader keen to maintain the alliance said.

                                                                                                               Nitish book on Bihar status
                            
	Patna, May 13 (PTI): Apparently annoyed with the Centre for giving preferential treatment to other states and ignoring the interests of Bihar, chief minister Nitish Kumar (in PTI picture) has written a book mentioning as to why the state should be granted a special status.        
	It took almost a year for Nitish to write the book Special Category Status: A Case for Bihar after his efforts to get the special category status for Bihar failed.        
	Yes, I have written a book on the conditions prevailing in the state and to convince the nation about the need for granting special status to Bihar...you will come to know about the details once it is published, Nitish said.        
	The printer and publisher of the 80-page book is Asian Development Research Institute (ADRI), an NGO. The book would be released by economist and writer Lord Meghnad Desai on May 15.        
	A senior official attached with the chief minister secretariat said that Nitish decided to write when the Centre reportedly failed to pay heed to repeated demands for special status to Bihar.        
	After taking the reins of Bihar in November 2005, Nitish had got a resolution adopted by the Assembly that sought special status for the state and had conveyed it to the Centre. The chief minister is understood to have highlighted on Centres delaying tactics in granting status which he has been trying to develop with scant resources at its disposal, the official said.        
	Poverty and backwardness are not new to Bihar. Other states are also facing these problems, but the Central government accorded special status to many such states which could not have undertaken development works with their resources.        
	The book blames the Centre for the sluggish growth in Bihar and relates it to poor flow of institutional finance from the Centre.        
	Meanwhile, Nitish today reiterated his stand with the NDA. Talking to reporters he said: I was in NDA and will remain there. In this election we (NDA) will become victorious and form the government.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 4: Rare drama unfolded in the public gallery of the Lok Sabha today as a man in a multi-coloured turban screamed for a separate high court in western Uttar Pradesh.         
	The House had just been adjourned after a verbal duel over the release of alleged 26/11 mastermind Hafiz Saeed in Pakistan, when Ram Sharan Sharma decided to make himself heard.        
	It was later found that Sharma had been recommended a public gallery pass by Aaron Rashid, a Congress MP from Tamil Nadu.        
	But guards in the House were quick to act. Sharma had shouted slogans only twice when three watch and ward marshals swooped on him, grabbed the man in white kurta-pyjamas by the waist, and physically lifted him out of the gallery.         
	RJD chief Lalu Prasad and Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav were seen looking up at the galleries after Speaker Meira Kumar had adjourned proceedings for an hour following demands by the Opposition for a government response to Pakistan releasing the Jamaat-ud Dawa chief yesterday.

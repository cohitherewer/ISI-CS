	Mumbai, Aug. 16 (PTI): Aishwarya Rai is down with a chest infection and flu-like symptoms, Amitabh Bachchan has announced in his blog.        
	The 35-year-old actress, shooting with husband Abhishek Bachchan in Ooty for Mani Ratnams Ravana, also has high fever, her worried father-in-law wrote while attending to ailing friend and Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh in Singapore.        
	Aishwarya has taken ill and is down with chest infection and flu- like symptoms. (She) had a high fever yesterday but is settling down today, Bachchans blog said.         
	Its worrying to be so far away from children and not be there to look after them. Yes, they are mature and married and responsible, but children will always remain children, the star added.        
	The 66-year-old actor also complained that he has been suffering from a strained back.         
	(Wife) Jaya left this evening for Mumbai after having spent more than a month by the side of Amar Singhji during his ailment. I (will) stay back till he is sound enough to travel back, he wrote.

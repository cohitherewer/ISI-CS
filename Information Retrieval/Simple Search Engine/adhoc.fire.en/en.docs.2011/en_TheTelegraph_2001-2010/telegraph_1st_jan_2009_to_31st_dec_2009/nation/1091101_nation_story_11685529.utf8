The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cancer surgery with less recurrence risk
                                                                                                               Cancer surgery with less recurrence risk
          G.S. MUDUR                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 31: A 37-year-old Hyderabad woman with breast cancer has become the first patient in India to undergo a surgical strategy expected to reduce the risk of cancer recurrence  through radiotherapy at the time of surgery.        
	In a 120-minute procedure conducted on Friday at a private hospital in Hyderabad, surgeons excised a 2cm tumour from her right breast, delivered a dose of X-rays to her breast through her wound for 39 minutes, then closed the surgical incision.         
	The technique, known as targeted intraoperative radiotherapy (Targit) and first applied in the UK about 10 years ago, was developed by a UK-based Indian doctor and his colleagues.        
	There is evidence that fluids in the surgical wound stimulate proliferation of tumour cells and may be responsible for cancer recurrence, said Jayant Vaidya, a surgeon at University College London, who had helped develop Targit.        
	The delivery of radiation during surgery alters wound environment and produces an anti-tumour effect, said Vaidya, who demonstrated the surgery at Hyderabad as part of an effort to help the technology spread worldwide.         
	Patients in the UK, Denmark, Italy, Germany and Canada have undergone the procedure. Vaidya and his colleagues had described its advantage in the journal Clinical Cancer Research last year.        
	Cancer surgeons also expect that this single-session simultaneous surgery-and-radiation technique may replace the typical six-week post-operative radiotherapy prescribed to patients with breast cancer.         
	In the last century, complete mastectomy (full breast excision) was replaced with six weeks of radiotherapy to the whole breast, Vaidya told The Telegraph. We are now taking the next step  concentrating radiotherapy to the tumour bed and potentially avoiding whole breast radiotherapy, he said.        
	Studies have shown that the external radiotherapy boost given after the wound has healed may miss the target zone in 25 per cent to 80 per cent of cases. The waiting period itself may pose a risk to patients because the tumour bed and wound fluids may stimulate tumour proliferation. The Targit strategy delivers radiation with high precision and at a period of highest recurrence susceptibility.        
	I think this has great potential, said Arun Kurkure, a breast cancer surgeon at Breach Candy Hospital, Mumbai. It could also be a boon for patients who have to travel to distant cities for treatment. Instead of staying there six weeks for therapy, radiation could be given right on the operation table  without compromising the chance of a cure, Kurkure said.        
	A clinical trial comparing Targit and the six-week radiation therapy involving 31 medical centres around the world has been under way since 2000 and is expected to be completed in early 2010.         
	At the Indo American Hospital, Hyderabad, Vaidya, chief surgical oncologist Mohan Vamsy and cancer surgeon Sushila Narayan applied Targit yesterday for the first time in India on two patients  a 37-year-old woman and a 38-year-old woman.        
	We think this is the future, said a surgical team member. The external radiotherapy has adverse effects on the skin  so this also has the potential to be cosmetically better for patients, the surgeon said.

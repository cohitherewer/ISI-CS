The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CPM blames third front govt card 
                                                                                                               CPM blames third front govt card 
          JAYANTH JACOB                          Karat at the news conference in Delhi on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, June 22: The CPM today pinned the blame for the poll debacle on the unrealistic appeal for the formation of a third front government but steered clear of indicting another national factor: the withdrawal of support to the erstwhile Congress-led government.        
	The party also referred to state factors in Bengal and Kerala but laid stress on the mistake of overselling the possibility of a government headed by the third front.        
	In a communique issued after two days of talks, the CPM central committee said it had been unrealistic in calling for installation of a third front government at the Centre in the absence of a countrywide electoral alliance.        
	In the absence of a countrywide alliance and no common policy platform being presented, the call for an alternative government was unrealistic, it said. It failed to be a viable and credible alternative at the national level.        
	Sources said there had been criticism about overstretching the initial call to build an alternative to as far as discussing who the Prime Minister candidate of a third front government could be.        
	The slip was all the more unrealistic as it had been made when the CPM had poll pacts only in four states. Moreover, the CPM and its partners were not even contesting 272 seats.The central committee reiterated that it will continue to strive to build the third alternative. Till then the party will forge electoral alliances with like-minded non-Congress secular parties, the communique said.        
	At a news conference later, Prakash Karat took responsibility, with the central committee, for pushing the third front government option. I, as the general secretary, have taken the responsibility for implementing the decisions of the central committee (CC). To that extent, I am also responsible along with the CC, he said.        
	On the Left withdrawal of support to the UPA, Karat said: There is near-unanimity on the withdrawal of support in our party. On the question of timing, earlier also there was a discussion that we should have done it earlier.        
	The communique said the Bengal state committee review had pointed to some erosion of support among the partys rural and urban poor and sections of the middle class. So there would be some reworking of policies, including industrialisation and land acquisition.

                                                                                                               Graft charge on minister
          MANJEET SEHGAL WARRIOR SHIMLA,                               
	Shimla, Aug. 4: Union steel minister Virbhadra Singh and his wife Pratibha have been booked for corruption, police said in Shimla today.         
	Virbhadra Singh and his wife Pratibha Singh were booked on Monday night by the state vigilance and anti-corruption bureau. S.R. Mardi, inspector-general of police (vigilance), said.         
	The case has been filed on the basis of a forensic test report that confirmed that the voice in an audio CD released by former Himachal Pradesh tourism minister Vijay Singh Mankotia in June 2007 matched with the voice of Virbhadras and his wife.         
	Virbhadra was heard referring to some monetary transactions on the phone with former Shimla deputy commissioner Mahinder Lal, who is dead. Pratibha, who is a former MP from Mandi, too could be heard talking about a money deal with someone called Jain.         
	Sources said the report of the forensic examination of the CD from Central Forensic Science Laboratory, Chandigarh, was received sometime back but the case could not be registered.                     
	Virbhadra Singh was not available for comment despite repeated attempts to reach him on phone.         
	A five-time chief minister and MP Virbhadra Singh belongs to the erstwhile princely state of Rampur Bushehr.         
	He is the only Congress MP from Himachal Pradesh. He had won Mandi parliamentary constituency election by a margin of 13,000 votes.

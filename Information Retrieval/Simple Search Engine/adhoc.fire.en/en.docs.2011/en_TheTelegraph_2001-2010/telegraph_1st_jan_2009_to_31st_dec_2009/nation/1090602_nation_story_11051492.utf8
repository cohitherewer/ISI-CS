	New Delhi, June 1: A lecturer at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences was arrested on suspicion of leaking todays MBBS entrance exam question papers, but investigations revealed the woman had passed on fake papers.         
	Meena Agarwal, a senior nursing lecturer at the institute, was picked up from the Kavi Nagar area of Ghaziabad, a suburb east of Delhi, after an anonymous tip-off that she was selling what she claimed were papers of the entrance exam, police said. The test was held in 92 centres across the country.        
	Weve registered a case of fraud, Happy Gupta, assistant superintendent of police at Ghaziabad, said. Weve verified from AIIMS and compared the papers  the papers she was passing are not the question papers, Gupta added.        
	AIIMS, too, denied any leak, saying the verification of what were initially suspected to be photocopies of the exam papers recovered from the lecturer showed that they were not the real one.        
	The information relating to the paper leak is totally false. The institute has verified it (the seized papers) and it has been concluded that the alleged paper does not match with those for the entrance test being held today, AIIMS spokesperson Y.K. Gupta said.        
	About 45,000 candidates are expected to have taken the exam, competing for 72 seats in the undergraduate MBBS programme at the countrys most sought-after medical school.        
	Agarwal had been given Rs 15,000 as initial payment by one of the candidates, but she appeared to have made a demand of about Rs 5 lakh, assistant superintendent Gupta said.         
	The police did not say how many candidates Agarwal had approached.        
	The candidates, whose identities have not been released by the police, had passed Class XII and were preparing for medical entrance tests. They were released after questioning.        
	Agarwal will be produced in a Ghaziabad court tomorrow, the police said.

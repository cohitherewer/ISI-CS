          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 5: Amar Singh, snubbed by CPM leader Prakash Karat, came down a couple of notches and agreed to meet Digvijay Singh to discuss seat-sharing in Uttar Pradesh.        
	The Samajwadi Party general secretary, who had begged Left leaders for a meeting to tell the Congress he was looking at other options, was lucky with CPI boss A.B. Bardhan who met him this week. But Karat refused, saying there was no meeting ground with the Samajwadis right now.        
	Amar then sought time from Digvijay, the Congress general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh, last evening.        
	Congress sources said Digvijay gave him a list of 25 seats the party wished to fight. Although the Samajwadis had said they would only spare 15 of the 80 seats, sources claimed Amar agreed to part with 20. He also accepted Digvijays proposal for friendly fights in the five or six remaining seats for which the Congress had heavyweights in mind.        
	Digvijay brought up the matter of Kalyan Singh, expressing concern that his association with the Samajwadis would impact Muslim votes, sources said. He said the Congress would not share a platform with the former BJP leader who was chief minister when Babri Masjid was demolished. Nor would it allow any mention of Kalyan on posters and literature the two parties might jointly print.        
	Amar asked Digvijay not to exacerbate the attack on Kalyan, the sources added.        
	Samajwadi president Mulayam Singh Yadav today met Kalyan, who told him he wished to contest from Etah.

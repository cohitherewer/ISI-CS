	Srinagar, Aug. 1: Militants struck in Srinagar after more than a month and shot two CRPF personnel and a police constable at point-blank range today, leaving one dead and critically injuring two, including a paramilitary man from Bengal.        
	Young men with pistols carried out the attacks at two places in the heart of the city. The first strike took place at Regal Chowk shortly before noon when two militants fired at the two CRPF men.        
	Half an hour later, gunmen shot police constable Mohammad Shafi Bhat dead outside a fire station near Hotel Akbar in Batamaloo, around 2km away.         
	Describing the Regal Chowk attack, a police officer said: They fired at point-blank range and disappeared among the lanes. The two cops, identified as B.D. Ghosh of West Bengal and Firdous Bhat of Baramulla district of north Kashmir, were shifted to hospital.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP raring for poll battle in Bhopal 
                                                                                                               BJP raring for poll battle in Bhopal 
          RASHEED KIDWAI      
	Bhopal, March 14: Landlocked Madhya Pradesh is emerging as an island of hope for the BJP.        
	While it is struggling elsewhere to keep alliances intact and cadre morale high, the party is comfortably placed vis--vis traditional rival Congress in the heartland state.        
	The process of selection of candidates has been relatively smooth, thanks to the presence of Sushma Swaraj in Bhopal.        
	The BJP veteran is a nominee from Vidisha, less than an hours drive from the state capital.        
	Moreover, the top BJP leadership has put Sushma in charge of Madhya Pradesh, which has helped her as well as chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan take quick decisions.        
	In contrast, the Congresss deliberations have taken place in faraway Delhi. In fact, the AICC man in charge of Madhya Pradesh, B.K. Hariprasad, has not visited the state since his appointment last month.        
	State Congress leaders who attended screening committee meetings under Shivraj Patil were reportedly given a copy of dos and donts for politicians authored by the former Union home minister.        
	Patil followed it up with a long discourse on why terrorism should not become a poll issue.        
	Insiders said the meeting ended without discussing the merits and shortcomings of prospective candidates.        
	On the other side of the divide, the confidence level of some state ministers is so high after the BJPs spectacular victory in the November Assembly polls that many are offering to contest against Congress stalwarts like Kamal Nath and Jyotiraditya Scindia. A sharp contrast to the past when Chhindwara and Guna were considered lost seats.        
	The BJP yesterday said former state minister Narrotam Mishra would take on Scindia from Guna. Although Mishras Assembly seat, Datia, is not part of the Guna parliamentary segment, chief minister Chauhan is confident of an upset.        
	Informed sources said during ticket distribution, Chauhan backed Mishra over Congress leader Digvijay Singhs brother Laxman, a BJP MP from neighbouring Rajgarh.        
	Chauhan seems to be impressed by the way Mishra won Datia in the recent state polls when many in the BJP had written him off.        
	Mishras traditional seat, Dabra, has become a reserved segment after the delimitation exercise that redrew constituency boundaries.        
	Sources said Mishras campaign could be headed by Anup Mishra, former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees nephew and a senior minister in the Chauhan cabinet.        
	While Kamal Nath and his team are busy preparing for the battle for Chhindwara, two of Chauhans colleagues have said in public they want to take on the Union minister.        
	One of them is state commerce minister Kailash Vijayvargiya, seen as No. 2 in the Chauhan government. The other is co-operatives minister Gauri Shankar Bisen, who came under the Election Commissions glare recently for allegedly distributing wristwatches to some local journalists.        
	Former Union minister Prahlad Patel is said to be a dark horse. Although Patel, once a close associate of expelled BJP leader Uma Bharti, has not returned to the parent outfit, Chauhan is said to be keen on fielding him against Kamal Nath.        
	In the Congress camp, there is confusion over the candidature of state party chief Suresh Pachauri.        
	The 54-year-old has served four consecutive terms in the Rajya Sabha and is said to be keen on contesting from Hoshangabad. But the AICC is yet to give him clearance.        
	The Congress has also not yet found a suitable nominee to take on Sushma in Vidisha.

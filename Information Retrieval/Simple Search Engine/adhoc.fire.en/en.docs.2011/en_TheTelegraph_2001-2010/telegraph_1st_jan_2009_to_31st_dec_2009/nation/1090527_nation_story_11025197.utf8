The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Govt in minority job push
                                                                                                               Govt in minority job push
          CITHARA PAUL                               
	New Delhi, May 26: The Centre has started work on minority welfare plans, including a proposal for reservation in private sector jobs, even before ministry formation is complete.        
	The Prime Ministers Office, aware of the big role the community played in returning the UPA to power, has asked the minority affairs ministry to submit a plan of action along with a status report on existing schemes.        
	The ministry has finalised its wish list and proposals, which could be submitted in a day or two.        
	We got intimation from the PMO the day after the first set of ministers took oath. We were quite surprised by the keenness of the PMO in minority welfare, said an official.         
	One of the major recommendations the ministry has lined up is reservation in private sector jobs. It is said to have collected information on emerging jobs in the private sector from industry bodies like Assocham to help it formulate a policy. Previous moves to introduce such quotas for other disadvantaged sections have not materialised.         
	The data (from industry bodies) will probably be used to identify sectors where reservation could be worked out once our proposal is accepted, said the ministry official.        
	Other recommendations include five minority universities, a special department to promote skill development, targeted training for minority youths for sunrise-sector jobs and more scholarships. Several existing plans, such as the merit-cum-means scholarships, are said to have helped thousands of Muslim students across the country.        
	The ministry also wants an increased role for community elders in conceiving schemes.         
	This recommendation has been made keeping in mind the criticism that the ministry had failed to sell many of its schemes among the elders.        
	Manmohan Singh is said to be sensitive towards minority issues. It was at his initiative that the ministry exclusively meant for the welfare of minorities was formed in 2006.         
	The move had been criticised on the ground that it amounted to minority appeasement, but the Prime Minister stuck to the decision.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Maya seeks split UP with eye on voters
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Maya seeks split UP with eye on voters
          OUR BUREAU                          Mayavati in Lucknow. (PTI)                                  
	Dec. 11: If the Congress can move to divide Andhra Pradesh hoping to rule two states instead of one, Mayavati believes she can go one better and get three at the price of one.        
	She today wrote to the Prime Minister asking him to take the initiative to carve out of Uttar Pradesh two new states: Harit Pradesh in the west and Bundelkhand in the southwest. Sources said the chief minister reckoned she could rule all three.        
	In the proposed Harit Pradesh, expected to span from Ghaziabad to Shahjahanpur in central Uttar Pradesh, Mayavati now has 40 of the 59 Assembly seats. Dalits  predominantly from her own Jatav caste  make up 22 per cent of the regions population and the most backward castes about 20 per cent.        
	In Bundelkhand, a similar base of Dalits and most backwards has brought her 17 of 22 seats.        
	Nor will trifurcation rob Uttar Pradesh of its primacy in national politics. It will still retain 54 of its 80 Lok Sabha seats, losing only 22 to Harit Pradesh and four to Bundelkhand.        
	As a bonus, the biggest loser will be Mayavatis main rival, Mulayam Singh Yadav. The Samajwadi Party has never made much headway in Bundelkhand whose harsh terrain and climate has kept away the aspirational intermediate and backward castes like the Yadavs.        
	Nor did Mulayam ever get a foothold in western Uttar Pradesh (the proposed Harit Pradesh) despite the presence of a large Muslim population, except when he had tied up with Ajit Singhs Rashtriya Lok Dal in 2004.        
	Mulayam had tried to replicate mentor Charan Singhs Majgar (Muslim-Ahir-Jat-Gujjar-Rajput) coalition of landowners, but the Jats would not accept a Yadav leader while the Rajputs and Gujjars cared for individuals, not parties.        
	In Charan Singhs day, the backward castes and Jats were not empowered enough to have their own ambitions; and post-Mandal, the Gujjars wondered why they should be led by a Yadav when the Jats had their own Ajit Singh.        
	Mayavatis possible adversaries, therefore, will be Ajit in Harit Pradesh and the Congress or the BJP in Bundelkhand.        
	The Samajwadis have been quick to oppose Mayavatis move, Amar Singh dubbing it political gimmickry.        
	Mayavatis calculations became clear today when reporters asked if she was open to a Poorvanchal state in the east, too. She hedged, saying the initiative should come from Patna as the proposed state is to have several Bihar districts.        
	The Bahujan Samaj Party is weak and the Samajwadis influential in eastern Uttar Pradesh, but the addition of a slice of Bihar can dilute Mulayams strength in the region.        
	Mayavati said she had always favoured smaller states and districts.

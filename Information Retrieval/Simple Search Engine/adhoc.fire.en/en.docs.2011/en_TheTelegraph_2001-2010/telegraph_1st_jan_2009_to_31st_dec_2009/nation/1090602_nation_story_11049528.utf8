The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cops question medical report
                                                                                                               Cops question medical report
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Cuttack, June 1: Cuttack police today labelled a medical report, submitted by an SCB College and Hospital team on charges of kidney theft, inconclusive.         
	Deputy commissioner of police Amitendra Nath Sinha told The Telegraph that the boards report was incomplete, as it failed to address the polices suspicions.         
	We have sought yet another a detailed report to enable us to conclude the investigation satisfactorily, he said.        
	According to sources, the police have also expressed unhappiness over the tardy investigation and a delay in submission of the report by the medical board.         
	On May 21, 2007, Babuli Natha of Tirtol (Jagatsinghpur) had lodged a complaint against a private clinic after he suspected that the clinic had stolen a kidney from his son, Avinash, 12, in course of an appendicitis operation.        
	The complaint was lodged with the Cuttack- Bhubaneswar police commissioner B.K. Sharma, who sought the medical boards help in the case.        
	Cuttack police then registered a case under Sections 18, 19 and 20, of the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994, and Sections 326, 378 and 120 (b) of the IPC.         
	But, in absence of medical experts report the kidney pilferage theory became untenable.         
	An urologist and a nephrologist in the medical team had ascertained that the boy was probably born with a single kidney.         
	The boys condition was first reported during a preliminary investigation (an ultrasound test and MRI) conducted at the Institute of Medical Science and SUM Hospital in Bhubaneswar on May 18, 2009.        
	The same was recorded on May 20, 2009, in an MRI report conducted at the Kalinga Hospital in Bhubaneswar.        
	Abhinash was admitted at a private hospital on October 29, 2006 and an appendicitis operation was performed on the child on October 31, 2006. He was discharged on November 11, 2006.         
	Before the operation, two test reports conducted had surprisingly recorded the presence of both the childs kidneys.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhopal, Sept. 15: Three tribals were killed in police firing in a village in BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh, the incident coming a day after home minister P. Chidambaram urged top cops to protect the poor.        
	The villagers were protesting the polices failure to trace an advocate missing for over two months in a village, over 400km from Bhopal. Fifteen persons were injured in the police action, of which four were said to be critical.        
	Conflicting versions emerged about the events leading to the firing. Officially, the police claimed the villagers clashed with the cops who were trying to control the agitators. But some local officers said the police had to fire after one of their personnel was abducted by the villagers.        
	Dindori additional superintendent of police Raghuvansh Singh Bhadoriya claimed some miscreants, who had mixed with the crowd, threw stones and attacked an official.

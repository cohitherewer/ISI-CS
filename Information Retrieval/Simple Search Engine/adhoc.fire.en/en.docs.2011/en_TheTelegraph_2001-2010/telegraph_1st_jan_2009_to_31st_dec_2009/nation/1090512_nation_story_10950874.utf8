The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong sniffs 160, banks on boss PR 
                                                                                                               Cong sniffs 160, banks on boss PR 
  - Internal assessment sees party stitching up second UPA regime        RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Sonia: Wait and watch                                        
	New Delhi, May 11: The Congress will win 160 seats on its own and build enough critical mass for Sonia Gandhi to sew up a second version of the UPA, according to an internal assessment by the party.        
	It would also be ahead of the BJP by at least 20 to 30 seats, party strategists said as Election 2009 entered its last lap.         
	Sources said they were banking on Sonias PR skills and image to put the coalition back in form after Rahul Gandhis praise of two current adversaries  Nitish Kumar and Chandrababu Naidu  and divergent reactions from two spokespersons left a trail of confusion.        
	On her part, Soniaji has not issued a single statement that would get our allies worked up, a source said.        
	She didnt utter a word against Mulayam Singh Yadav and even her observations on Mayavati were political, not personal. Ram Vilas Paswan says that if Soniaji calls him, he would definitely respond to her positively. Rabri Devi has said she would go by what the mother (Sonia) says and not the son (Rahul).        
	Congress sources said Sonia had already embarked on damage-control by holding a joint rally with DMK chief M. Karunanidhi in Chennai yesterday and saying the right things on the Sri Lankan ethnic conflict. Karunanidhi had been upset after a Congress spokesperson described rival Jayalalithaas ADMK as a secular party.        
	Sources said Sonia was waiting for the verdict to see if the Congress gets the numbers it expects.         
	So far, she has reportedly kept her counsel to herself although Rahul had made it clear that all options were open after May 16, even with NDA partners  provided they snapped ties with the BJP.        
	We are ready to embrace a party that is presently part of the NDA but is ready to come out of it in the cause of secularism. Anybody can have a change of heart, a general secretary said.        
	Ahead of Wednesdays last round of polling, Congress strategists working out of the partys war room sounded reasonably confident of improving the 2004 tally of 145 and getting more seats than projected from BJP or NDA-ruled states like Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and even Gujarat.        
	The Congresss feedback is that except for Uttar Pradesh and, perhaps, Maharashtra, the BJP is unlikely to gain seats or make up for its losses in its strongholds.        
	Although the Prime Minister said today all secular parties were obliged to provide a purposeful government to thwart the NDA, a comment seen as an attempt to win Left support, anti-Left leaders in the Congress say if the party can help it, it shouldnt turn to the comrades.        
	Our best bet is the Left is reduced to 30 seats or less so that its bargaining power gets undermined, a cabinet minister said.        
	Sources, however, said Sonia and Rahul did not share this blinkered view.        
	None of us can forget that for the four-and-a-half years the Left backed us, we were spared the kind of unreasonable demands that our other allies are used to making, said a general secretary.

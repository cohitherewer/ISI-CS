          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          SM Krishna                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 30: S.M. Krishna today said he was the boss of the external affairs ministry and others must fall on the same page, appearing to issue a second rebuke in as many days to his junior Shashi Tharoor.        
	The broad policy parameters are dictated, decided by the minister in charge of external affairs of this country and everyone will have to fall on the same page, Krishna told reporters after a meeting with Tharoor.        
	The remarks suggested the foreign minister was finally displaying an assertive streak after being initially termed ineffective by the Opposition.        
	The meeting had come at the initiative of Tharoor who was chided by Krishna yesterday for using social networking site Twitter to question the new visa rules.        
	If Krishnas point on Tuesday was that Tharoor must not comment in public forums on government decisions, today he seemed to be signalling his readiness to stamp his authority on the ministry.        
	Asked if he was happy with the outcome of his meeting with Tharoor, he said: Oh yes. As the boss of the ministry, as head of the external affairs ministry, I am completely at peace with myself and the ministry. Everything is all right.        
	Krishna conceded there could be different perceptions about ministerial decisions.        
	As I have said in my statement earlier, if there are different perceptions then I think there is a method, there is a procedure where we sort out those issues and I am sure that Tharoor understands that, he said.        
	Asked about Tharoors habit of tweeting, he said: I would request you not to generalise issues. There could be different perceptions.        
	Krishna said he had discussed the visa issue with Tharoor but did not elaborate.        
	On the sale of arms by China to Pakistan, Krishna said the government was monitoring the developments.        
	All these developments are closely monitored by the external affairs ministry, by the defence ministry and various other ministries and the Prime Minister. So let us not get into yet another speculative area, he said.

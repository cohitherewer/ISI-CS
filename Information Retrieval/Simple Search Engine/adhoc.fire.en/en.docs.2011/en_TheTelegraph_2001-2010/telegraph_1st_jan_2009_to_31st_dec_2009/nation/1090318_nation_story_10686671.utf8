      30 DAYS TO GO*                              
	 Hyderabad: Two MPs, one each from the Telugu Desam Party and the TRS, who voted for the UPA in last Julys trust vote have been rewarded: both have won Congress tickets.          Another Desam leader who crossed over only days back is on the Congresss list, too, as are the sons of chief minister Y.S.R. Reddy and a senior Congress leader.          
	Y.S.Rs son and newspaper magnate Jaganmohan will contest from Kadapa, a seat his father and uncle and Vivekananda together held for close to two decades. The son of Congress leader G. Venkatswamy, G. Vivekanand, will carry forward the family legacy from Peddapalli, a constituency that his father held for years. Vivekananda heads Visakha Industries, which has a cement unit in Bengals Midnapore.           
	The Congress appears to have banked on experience, with its roster of 42 candidates packed with 27 sitting MPs.          
	 Chennai: Jayalalithaa has one question for all ticket-seekers arriving for interviews with her: Wheres your horoscope?           
	I apologised profusely for not bringing my horoscope and promised to send it within 24 hours, disclosed an applicant from Erode district. Most shortlisted ADMK candidates called for the interviews were stunned when asked to furnish their horoscopes.           
	They had taken their CVs, record of work for the party and public service, and proof of caste and spending capacity. But not that most important document their party chief was looking for.          
	Sources said a firm believer in astrology, Jayalalithaas programmes are charted only after consulting the almanac.           
	 Farrukhabad: Promising us the moon? Stay away.          
	Thats the message residents of a village in this Uttar Pradesh district are sending to glib-talking politicians making commitments unlikely to be fulfilled.          
	Fed up of promises not kept by elected representatives earlier, the people of Nagla Chandela Moja Rajarampur have also threatened to boycott this election.          
	Road nahin to vote nahin, pehle road, phir vote (no vote without roads, first road then vote), reads one of the banners put up by the angry residents around the village.          
	The grievances have been submitted in writing to the district magistrate, officials said.
        *For first day of polls

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Forum challenges CBIs Shopian report
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Forum challenges CBIs Shopian report

	Srinagar/New Delhi, Dec. 16: An investigation by a team of professionals into the death of two women in Shopian has punched holes in the CBI report that has ascribed the tragedy to drowning and accused six doctors of fabricating evidence to prove rape and murder.         
	The probe into the death of Neelofar, 22, and Asiya, 17, carried out by the New Delhi-based Independent Womens Initiative for Justice, has raised questions about the CBI report, submitted to the high court on Monday.         
	Among the most glaring flaws, says the forum, is the contention that the hymen of one of the women was intact, which, the agency cited as proof to rule out rape. The CBI, which started the probe in September, exhumed the bodies four months after they were buried.         
	Medico-legal experts The Telegraph spoke to expressed similar views, saying an intact hymen four months after death was a medical wonder.        
	A CBI officer, who refused to be identified, said their investigation was foolproof. We will prove it in the court, he said, refusing to elaborate.        
	A team from the forum visited the state in August and has come up with an interim report, titled Shopian: Manufacturing a Suitable Story, made public today. The team comprised Uma Chakravarty, a historian, Usha Ramanathan, law professor at Delhi University, Seema Misra, Vrinda Grover (both lawyers), Ajita, a doctor, and Anuradha Bhasin Jamwal, a journalist.         
	In its chargesheet, the CBI, which relied on a forensic medicine team from AIIMS, New Delhi, has said Asiyas hymen was intact and therefore no rape took place.         
	Hymen (of Asiya) was intact and admitted tip of little finger...there was nothing suggestive of penetration of penis or like object through the hymenial opening, the chargesheet said.         
	Forensic medicine specialists expressed surprise. This wont stand medical scrutiny, said Ramesh Sharma, president of the Indian Association of Medico-Legal Experts. How can a membrane as thin as the hymen remain intact so many months after death, he told The Telegraph.         
	Forensic doctors say the hymen, just like other membranes and tissues, would undergo decomposition.         
	A senior forensic medicine expert at AIIMS also questioned the link between hymen and rape.         
	An intact hymen does not confirm virginity and a ruptured hymen does not necessarily prove sexual intercourse, the doctor said. This is undergraduate medicine textbook knowledge, the doctor said.         
	Sharma pointed out that legally, the mere touching of the vagina constitutes rape  penetration is not important to establish it.         
	The forum has also questioned the CBIs argument that the water level in the Rambiara stream, into which the women purportedly fell, was enough to cause drowning.        
	Jamwal, one of the co- authors of the forums report, said they had photographic evidence to prove that stream had ankle-deep water when the team visited the place in August.         
	In May, the ice from the glaciers had not even melted. How could the level have been high then, she countered.        
	Jamwal wondered why the women would have decided to wade through the stream when there is a bridge and road right next to it.         
	The forum expressed surprise at the CBIs charge that Dr Nighat Challo and other doctors involved in the second autopsy had fudged the vaginal smears of the dead women and submitted the samples of others.        
	But when we talked to her (Nighat), she explained in detail how she had collected the samples. We have no reason not to believe her, said Bhasin.         
	The team had spoken to Nighat in August. The CBI claims the doctor had confessed to fudging the slides and even used her own vaginal smears as sample.        
	The forum has accused the CBI of helping cover up the state governments cover-up. The government had initially said the women had died by drowning, triggering upheaval in the state.

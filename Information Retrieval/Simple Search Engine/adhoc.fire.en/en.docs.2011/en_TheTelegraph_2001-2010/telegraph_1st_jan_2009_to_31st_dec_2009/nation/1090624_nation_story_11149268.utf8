	Lakhisarai (Bihar), June 23 (PTI): A senior government official and two security personnel were injured today when armed Naxalites attacked the civil court premises and freed their commander Babulal Besra during the bandh called to protest police action in Lalgarh.        
	Over 50 rebels raided the premises, broke the lock-up open and freed Besra, hailing from Giridih (Jharkhand), said district magistrate P.K. Jha. They also attacked a police posse that tried to block their way and robbed a carbine and two rifles from the men, who were outnumbered by the guerrillas, he said.        
	Deputy development commissioner (Lakhisarai) Rajiv Ranjan sustained minor injuries when chunks of wood flying from the smashed window of his room hit him. Two constables, who suffered splinter injuries, were rushed to the hospital.        
	Meanwhile, the men also blasted a tower of a private telephone service provider in Gaya and a community centre in Aurangabad. The roof of a panchayat building was also blown off and its walls cracked due to the blast.        
	Bundu added that all furniture was destroyed. Following the blast, personnel launched a search neach Chahapur, 190km from Ranchi. Scores of CPI(Maoist) rebels swooped on in Jhikatia village in Aurangabad district shortly after midnight and set off dynamites to blow up a community centre building, police said. However, none was injured as the building was empty.

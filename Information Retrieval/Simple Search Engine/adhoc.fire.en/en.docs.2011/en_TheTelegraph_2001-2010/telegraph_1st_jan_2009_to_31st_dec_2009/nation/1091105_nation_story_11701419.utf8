          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Nov. 4: The Centre plans to declare Mahatma Gandhis belongings as antiques and bar their auction or sale by anyone who possesses the articles.        
	The culture ministry is planning to amend the Antiquities and Art Treasures Act 1972 for the purpose. Under the act, an article or object that has been in existence for less than 100 years can be declared an antique.        
	Once such a declaration is made, anyone who possesses the items has to register it with the government. Sales will be barred after that.         
	We have decided to amend this (act) as the government does not want Gandhijis belongings to be commodified, a ministry official said .        
	The amendment plans have been prompted by the governments failure earlier this year to prevent the auction of the Mahatmas Zenith pocket watch, steel-rimmed spectacles, a pair of sandals, and an eating bowl and plate.         
	The sale of the articles, which were with James Otis, a private collector, had fetched $1.8 million (Rs 8.4 crore).         
	Now the government doesnt want to take chances. We were criticised a lot (for failing to stop the sale) and we dont want it to be repeated, said the ministry official.        
	The government may also request other countries with which India has reciprocal arrangements for preservation of antiques to ask people who possess such items to register and prevent their auction.

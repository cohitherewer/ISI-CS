The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Wayward state, 42 haze
                                                                                                               Wayward state, 42 haze
          SHANTANU DATTA IN RANCHI                                        
	A fallen hero in the autumn of his health and career lies in hospital. Carpe diem, says his eldest son and stakes claim to his empire, leaving his fathers loyalists fretting and fuming and their friends distraught.        
	A former chief minister steps in for a do-or-die effort, while another tries his luck along with a host of other wannabes whose only aspiration is to damage the prospects of others.        
	Elections have opened a new chapter of uncertainty in Jharkhand, now paying the price of its wayward ways with a governor calling the shots  and not doing too bad a job  overseen by a tense security apparatus under the looming shadow of Maoist terror.        
	As many as 13 sitting MPs are in the fray in the 14 Lok Sabha seats, and not one is really sure of going back to Parliament. Of the two major formations, the Congress and the JMM, which together had won as many as 10 seats last time, sealed an early (7-5) deal.        
	But that has collapsed with an ailing Shibu Soren unable to rein in Durga Soren who seems hell bent on using the general elections to sort out a domestic dispute: who among his brothers will take over their fathers mantle.        
	Durgas stunt of filing nominations for the Godda Lok Sabha seat, originally meant for the Congress, and Shibu Sorens subsequent faxed message to the authorities disowning his sons candidature made public a rift that has been brewing for long. Ever since Soren Senior was confined to a hospital bed battling septicaemia, it was clear the JMM chief wouldnt be campaigning, spelling doom for his partys contestants, especially in the strongholds of Santhal Pargana.        
	The crisis of leadership became apparent after Shibu Soren lost the Tamar byelections, held to give him a berth in the Assembly after which the state came under Presidents rule. The Congress, having for so long propped up a regime led by Madhu Koda and his band of Independents, widely perceived to be lame duck, inefficient and corrupt, used the opportunity to delink.        
	Yet, it is this Congress opportunism to try and absolve itself of all blame that is likely to cost the party dear. Karia Munda, one-time minister in Vajpayee cabinet and now a nominee from Khunti, says the Koda governments ineffectiveness is there for all to see. The Simdega, Torpa roads were built during my tenure as MP, he says, citing an example of local development that has now come to a dead halt. And what about the MoUs that have been signed, has any project taken off?        
	The incumbency axe, therefore, must fall on the Congress. Five among six of its sitting MPs are lambs for the slaughter. Among them, only Ranchi MP Subodh Kant Sahay is relatively better placed.        
	Koda was a government in transit, explains Sahay. Our only aim was to ensure there was a non-BJP government, he adds, but admits the arrangement lasted for a year too long.        
	But are the people of Jharkhand convinced? Everyone knows how we were sidelined by the Koda cabinet. So how can we be held responsible for what has gone wrong? says Neil Tirkey, Mundas Congress rival in Khunti. Thats a desperate attempt to shrug off the dirt of non-performance thats bound to stick.        
	Step in Babulal Marandi, a former chief minister, widely accepted as among the few with a vision for Jharkhand. Having long parted ways with the BJP, he has fielded Jharkhand Vikas Morcha candidates in all 14 seats. This undoubtedly is his big chance.        
	Using a chopper to fly in and out of each and every constituency, he is his partys one-man army. Elect me and my nominees for restoring the dignity of Jharkhand in national politics, he says to good effect.        
	Babulal has fielded his men strategically. A liquor baron against former external affairs minister Yashwant Sinha in Hazaribagh, an ex-BJP leader in Godda and contenders serious enough to torment the frontrunners.        
	He now sees the wind changing and claims his JVM will emerge the largest party in the state. That may well be exaggerated, but one or two more seats other than his own in Koderma, and he is sure to be calling the shots in Delhi. Which way will he swing? Either is the popular guess, but Babulal is harping on a non-Congress, non-BJP coalition.        
	Other small but significant claimants to the 14-seat pie are the likes of Madhu Koda, former MLAs who need to test the waters  and inflict some damage along the way  to gauge their chances when their time comes for the Assembly elections.        
	At the end of day, as former external affairs minister Yashwant has only now come to realise, its that narrow village road and a dry well that count. I need to ensure welfare schemes go to the deserving. Housing, employment, old age pension must be received by the deserving, he says while roughing it out in the scorching 42C in Barhi, 40km from Hazaribagh.        
	Is he confident. Yes, never felt better.         
	If there is a wind, thats the way it seems headed. For the BJP. It is likely to do better than 2004 when it logged one seat. A few for Babulal and the dregs for Lalu Prasad RJD, the Congress and the JMM.  
	Jharkhand goes to polls today and on April 23

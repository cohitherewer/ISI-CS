The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Congress chooses polls after Rahul prod
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Congress chooses polls after Rahul prod
          SANJAY K. JHA                          Rahul Gandhi                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 13: The Congress leadership has decided to hold elections to every post in the party  from the block level to the highest policy-making body, the working committee.        
	Come January, all state unit (PCC) chiefs and office-bearers will be elected, not nominated.        
	Although elections to these posts are mandatory under the partys constitution, even the faade of internal democracy had been done away with in the last 10-15 years. Almost every appointment was being made by the high command.        
	Now all that is set to change, the prod coming from Rahul Gandhis drive for transparency and, by extension, democracy.        
	Rahulji started transparent elections in (party student body) NSUI and the Youth Congress. Many states have witnessed genuine elections to these frontal bodies and thats the best way to promote talent and build new leadership. The main Congress couldnt have remained insulated from the process for long and we decided to start it from next year, a party general secretary told The Telegraph.        
	Organisational elections will start in January and culminate in December with the election of the party president.        
	Although the high command, or entrenched leaders in states, will still be in a position to promote people of their choice, elections will make it difficult to completely suppress genuine leaders.        
	Party sources said the reform process would bring about dramatic changes in states where PCC posts are usually grabbed by those who have easier access to central leaders and spend most of their time lobbying Delhi.        
	We hope to have all elected PCC presidents from next year, a senior leader said.         
	Sources cited instances in states of entrenched leaders failing to push their supporters into the Youth Congress or the NSUI and new sets of leaders coming up through elections closely monitored by Rahul.        
	Although there have been complaints about apolitical people with money and muscle power successfully manipulating the elections to grab important positions, the party is by and large satisfied with the restoration of the democratic process.        
	Sources said the reform in the membership process was aimed at pre-empting such manipulations. Earlier, leaders used to pay from their pockets to enrol fake members. Usually, names were copied from the electoral rolls and any person who could arrange for 25 primary members, fake or genuine, used to become an active member of the party.         
	Now, every member has to give his or her photograph and signature or thumb impression. The party is also planning to computerise its membership register.         
	Congress veterans said though this might drastically curtail the number of party members, screening at the time of enrolment and training was important.        
	Everybody should not be allowed to become a Congress member, a veteran All India Congress Committee office-bearer said, recalling an incident from Gandhijis time.        
	Gandhiji had come to know about an infamous contractor becoming a Congress member in Barabanki. He asked Nehru to write to the district president. Nehru promptly sent a query on a postcard. The district president ignored it. Gandhi forced Nehru to follow up that issue and the contractor was finally removed from the party.

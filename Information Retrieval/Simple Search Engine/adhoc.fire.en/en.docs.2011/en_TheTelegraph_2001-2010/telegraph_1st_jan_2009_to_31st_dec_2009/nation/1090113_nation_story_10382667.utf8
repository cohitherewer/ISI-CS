	New Delhi, Jan. 12: The Mumbai attack evidence is credible and needs to be acted upon quickly, Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai said today, backing Indias efforts to mount international pressure on Pakistan.        
	Karzai was forthright in condemning the violence. He said the evidence India had shared with the international community was credible and Pakistan needed to act quickly on it to bring the Mumbai attackers to justice, an official said after Karzais talks with Manmohan Singh.        
	Karzai, speaking about last Julys attack on the Indian embassy in Kabul, told the Prime Minister about the resurgence of the Taliban and other terror outfits in the region.        
	A joint statement issued after the meeting between the two leaders called for full compliance with bilateral, multilateral and international obligations to prevent terrorism originating from territories under their control.         
	The statement said that since terror often emanated from sanctuaries and training camps, there was a need to cut off sustenance and support to terror groups.        
	Karzai stressed that many of the regions resurgent terror outfits had sanctuaries in Pakistan.        
	India has blamed the Mumbai attacks on the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Toiba and asked the neighbour to dismantle terror networks that operate from its soil.        
	Delhi announced a gift of 250,000 tonnes of wheat to Kabul to help Afghans cope with a food crisis. The shipment will be effected immediately, as soon as the government of Afghanistan has worked out its transportation arrangements, the joint statement said.        
	Singh also pledged help on infrastructure, telling Karzai that a power transmission line from Pul-e-Khumri to Kabul and a sub-station at Chimtala in northern Afghanistan would be completed and handed over soon. A road India was building from Zaranj to Delaram in southwest Afghanistan has been completed.        
	Karzais endorsement of the Mumbai evidence comes a day before British foreign secretary David Miliband arrives on a three-day visit that is likely to be dominated by talks on the Mumbai strike and its aftermath.        
	Miliband is scheduled to meet foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee and home minister P. Chidambaram. He will also visit Islamabad later this week for talks on ways to defuse India-Pakistan tensions following the November attack.        
	The British leader will meet his Pakistani counterpart, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani.

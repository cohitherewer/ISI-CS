The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Wakf minefield on Centre radar 
                                                                                                               Wakf minefield on Centre radar 
          CITHARA PAUL                              
	New Delhi, June 22: The Centre will try to reclaim all the wakf properties in the country that have been encroached on and hand their control over to the state wakf boards.        
	As a first step, the government will document and list all wakf properties and store the details centrally in a computer, a minority ministry official said.        
	The move will be seen as Muslim-friendly but is bound to stir controversies since, as a joint parliamentary committee has discovered, 80 per cent of the listed wakf properties in India have been encroached on (that is, sold surreptitiously).         
	We will do everything possible to get the wakf properties back to the state wakf boards. But nobody in the government or the boards has any clue how much assets the wakf boards really have, the ministry official said.        
	A wakf is a permanent endowment of a property, such as a building or plot of land, for Muslim religious or charitable purposes. The endowments may be made to individual bodies or trusts, but all such properties in a particular state are administered by a wakf board, a quasi-judicial body empowered to rule over wakf-related disputes.        
	But half the endowments never get listed with the state wakf board; and those that are listed are often deliberately undervalued, the official said.        
	All this has led to massive corruption. We want to clean up the whole mess.        
	The official said the government would verify all the available wakf documents and evaluate the properties. We hope it will bring much-needed transparency.        
	Many wakf properties are alleged to have been bought by big companies at cheap rates. The joint parliamentary committee had found out that even state governments had encroached on wakf properties.        
	The Maharashtra wakf board had filed an encroachment case in the Supreme Court accusing Reliance Industries relating to a south Mumbai property, and the ITC-run Windsor Manor Hotel in Bangalore got entangled in legal battle against the Karnataka wakf board.        
	The ministry will prepare a sub-list of wakf properties enmeshed in lawsuits. We will try all possible legal ways to reclaim the encroached-on properties, the official said.        
	Once the plots are recovered, developed and put to economic use, they could be used for the welfare of Muslims.

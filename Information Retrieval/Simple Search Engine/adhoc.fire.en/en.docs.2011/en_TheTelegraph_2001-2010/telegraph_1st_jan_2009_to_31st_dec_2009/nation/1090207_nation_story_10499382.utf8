The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Glare on govt role in VC selection
                                                                                                               Glare on govt role in VC selection
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           Yash Pal: Independent process                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 6: A higher education review will ask the government to stop interfering in the appointment of vice-chancellors in a scathing criticism of the selection policy for varsity top jobs.        
	Headed by former University Grants Commission chairman Yash Pal, the review committee will propose a new mechanism to select VCs in its final report to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, The Telegraph has learnt.         
	Criticism of the appointment process has largely been restricted to university administrators and the National Knowledge Commission. The HRD ministry has brushed aside the criticism while officially maintaining that top institutions must enjoy autonomy.        
	But the Yash Pal panels comments may prove harder to ignore since it was set up by the ministry, whose joint secretary is now the panels member-secretary. This is the first comprehensive review of the countrys higher education since Independence.         
	The panel is yet to pen its report but has nearly finalised its findings, based on discussions with universities across the country, it is learnt. A source privy to the findings said the report would contain a detailed critique of the appointment process, which, it would argue, stymied the autonomy of institutions.        
	An independent process of appointing vice-chancellors is key to ensuring the autonomy of our higher education institutions. At present, our universities are autonomous only on paper, the source said.        
	The current selection process largely swivels around the ministrys whims. When the post of vice-chancellor at a central university falls vacant, the ministry sets up a search-cum-selection team to shortlist potential nominees.         
	The team consists of a representative of the UGC, a ministry official and a representative of the governing body of the university. A list of two or three names is submitted.        
	The names are scanned by the ministry, which picks one  the criteria for the final choice are never made public. The ministry is known, on occasion, to have also added to the list a name not recommended by the search team.         
	The background of the nominee picked is scanned to ensure he has no criminal records. Once the HRD ministry receives an all-clear from the home ministry, it forwards the name to the President, who as the Visitor to all central universities, is the final appointing authority.        
	In most cases, the Presidents sanction to the HRD ministrys pick is merely a formality.         
	This current process ensures that those who wish to become VCs must be friendly to the ministry. It is impossible to expect them to be autonomous in their functioning as their presence as VC itself depends on the ministry, the source said.        
	The panel, in its report, will suggest vesting the search team with greater powers. The team should be selecting the vice-chancellor, not the ministry, the source added. The review panel may suggest that the search team should finalise one name, instead of the ministry selecting from a bunch of names, the source said.

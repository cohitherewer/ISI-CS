                                                                                                               Elephants take over campus
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 1: A herd of elephants today strayed into the Berhampur University campus, some 180km from the state capital, injuring one person and causing panic among students, employees and their families.         
	The herd comprising 10 elephants kept people on the campus terrified till the evening, said Berhampur divisional forest officer A.K. Jena, while speaking to The Telegraph from the spot.         
	Jena said the elephant herd that was seen around Sundar hills near Chhatrapur some 20km from Berhampur last evening was sighted in the jungle behind the university high school in the campus at around 4am today.         
	The elephants injured one Mangala Panigrahi, the son of university driver Bijoy Panigrahi, causing panic in the campus. Panigrahi was rushed to the MKCG Medical College and Hospital in Berhampur for treatment, said the DFO.         
	Berhampur university vice-chancellor Professor B.K. Sahu said he informed the forest and police officers immediately after hearing the news.         
	Sahu has advised people on the campus to not venture too near to the elephant or tease the animals in any manner.         
	Armed police forces have cordoned off the area to prevent further untoward incidents, said a senior police officer.         
	Preparations for the celebration of the 43rd Foundation Day of the university scheduled for tomorrow have been hampered due to the presence of the animals, sources said.         
	District forest officer Jena conceded that a large crowd gathered to see the elephants was creating logistical problem for the forest officers.         
	We will start the drive in the evening and take efforts to chase them away towards the Berbera forests, he added.         
	This herd was a part of huge herd comprising more than 20 elephants that had strayed from Chandka sanctuary located on the outskirts of Bhubaneswar in 2007 and have been moving across Ganjam since then.

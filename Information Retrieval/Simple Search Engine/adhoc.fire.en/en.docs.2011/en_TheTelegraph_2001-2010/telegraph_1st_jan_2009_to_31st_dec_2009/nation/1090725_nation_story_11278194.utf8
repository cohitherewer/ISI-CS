          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, July 24: Orissa Assembly, which could not transact its business for the day after a snake was found inside the House yesterday, resumed its session today.        
	A decision was taken at the all-party meeting held at the Speakers chamber yesterday held that the proceedings would be resumed from today with all precautions. Thus, doctors, vets and snake experts were kept on guard outside the Assembly to attend to any eventuality.        
	The snake has not been traced yet. We have taken all precautions to ensure safety of legislators, said Speaker Pradip Kumar Amat.         
	Doctors were ready with anti-venom serum and medicines. Volunteers of the Snake Helpline, an NGO, were kept on guard with a cleft stick to catch the snake if it could be traced today. Officials of Nandan Kanan and members of Snake Helpline had declared the House safe after a daylong search yesterday.         
	However, the House could not resume its business yesterday in the afternoon apparently due to prevailing chaos and was adjourned.         
	A two-and-a-half feet cobra was spotted by sweeper Bhisma Nayak, when entered the House to clean it.         
	The visitor then crawled towards the chief ministers desk and disappeared.

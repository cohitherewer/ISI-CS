The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | IPL ball back in Centre court
                                                                                                               IPL ball back in Centre court
          OUR BUREAU                              
	March 12: States have put the onus of security for the Indian Premier League matches back on the Centre, saying they cannot do without paramilitary forces.        
	Union home ministry sources said eight states that were sent the revised schedule for the T20 tournament have in their replies demanded central troops. The ministry had earlier said that beyond a limit, it would be difficult to spare paramilitary forces from poll duty.        
	Bengal said the matches could be held in Calcutta provided there was no depletion of the strength of the city police force during the elections and at least 30 companies of paramilitary forces were made available for the match proposed on May 4, three days before the second round of polling. One company has about 125 men.        
	If the men cant be made available  that, too, at least two days before the game  then the Bengal government would suggest that the match be either shifted to an earlier date or held after counting is over on May 16.        
	We have assessed that around 4,000 personnel are required for covering the ground and the hotels and therefore the demand for 30 companies of paramilitary forces for the May 4 match. Besides, you also have to keep in mind the Lahore incident (terror attack on the Sri Lankan cricketers). Since there is an election scheduled on May 7, it would not be possible to hold the match unless this strength is sent, Bengal chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said in Calcutta.         
	Thats not all. We would also inform the Centre that with the IPL matches being held in Calcutta during the elections, no one from the Calcutta police force should be drawn into the central pool that is being readied nationally for holding the elections, he added.        
	The decision came following a meeting chaired by Asok Chakrabarti and attended by home secretary Ardhendu Sen, director-general of police A. B. Vohra and Calcutta police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti.         
	Bengal had earlier expressed reservations over the original schedule because the match dates were too close to the poll days. The revised schedule worked out by IPL organisers packs in five of the seven matches in Calcutta between April 11 and 26, four days before the first round of Bengal elections on April 30. The last two matches are proposed for May 2 and 4.         
	The demand for paramilitary forces for the May 4 match is day specific. We want them at least two days in advance because it would take time for deployment. As for the other dates, we can handle them on our own, said city police chief Gautam Chakrabarti.         
	Andhra Pradesh, too, has written to the home ministry, saying it would not be possible to host matches  at Hyderabad and Visakhapatnam  until elections were over. Andhra votes on April 16 and 23.         
	Some other states, like Delhi, are learnt to have said they could hold the matches provided their existing paramilitary force deployment was not reduced.         
	Home minister P. Chidambaram is expected to review the issue on Friday.         
	Police fees        
	Commissioner Gautam Chakrabarti said that unlike the last time, Calcutta police would charge the IPL match organisers full fees for utilising the services of the force. Last year, the city police were paid around Rs 70 lakh.

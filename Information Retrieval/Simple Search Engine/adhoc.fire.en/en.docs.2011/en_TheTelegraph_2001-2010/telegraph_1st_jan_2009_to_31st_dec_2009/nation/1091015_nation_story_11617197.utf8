                                                                                                               EU moves on hill tea shield
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Darjeeling, Oct. 14: The European Union has sought public opinion on granting Darjeeling Tea protection from others using the geographical label.        
	The call for comments from people  those across the world can submit their opinion  is a significant step in the process to accord geographical indicator (GI) protection by the EU.        
	The US and some European countries such as the UK and Germany have already given such a status to the leaves grown in Darjeeling.         
	However, a blanket EU recognition will bar all member-nations from blending other brews and passing them off as Darjeeling Tea.        
	The EU has given six months to file objections before a decision will be taken to grant the GI status.        
	This is the first time a non-European entity  the Darjeeling Tea Association  has approached the EU for GI protection, the spokesperson for the Agriculture and Rural Department of the European Commission, Michael Mann, told the PTI in Brussels today.        
	However, some members of the Darjeeling Tea Association expressed the fear that many EU tea importers could try to oppose the move.         
	The GI status will hamper the interests of unscrupulous importers as only the tea that originates 100 per cent from the Darjeeling GI area can be sold as Darjeeling Tea, said Sandip Mukherjee, secretary of the Darjeeling Tea Association.        
	Planters said that even though Darjeeling produced about 10 million kg of leaves annually, almost 40 million kg were sold as Darjeeling Tea.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ships on patrol after Mumbai terror bell
                                                                                                               Ships on patrol after Mumbai terror bell
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                              
	Mumbai, July 15: At least three of the coast guards biggest ships are patrolling the high seas off Mumbai after the most specific intelligence in two years warned of another strike by the Lashkar-e-Toiba.        
	The latest input was sent by the Union home ministry to Maharashtra on July 8. It has been reinforced with a warning from US agencies.         
	The ministry input doesnt specify the number of terrorists planning to carry out the attack but mentions four possible dates chosen by Lashkar bosses.         
	This is the most specific and serious threat in the last two years. It is also the second warning in the past one month clearly mentioning a possible Lashkar attack on Mumbai. One of the four dates was last week, said a top Intelligence Bureau source.        
	The input mentions seven targets in Maharashtra, including the headquarters of a leading Indian private bank in Fort, part of Mumbais business hub that is also home to the Bombay Stock Exchange, the source said. The others include at least two major railway stations in Mumbai and another in Navi Mumbai.        
	Security has been increased at Churchgate, Dadar, Andheri and a few stations on the Harbour Line in Navi Mumbai. We are also focusing on some other spots not mentioned on the list, the source said.        
	The Centres input is based on photos of the targets recovered from a suspect in Jammu and Kashmir.        
	The warning prompted the coast guard to deploy its biggest ships  called offshore patrol vessels  in the largest security drill along the coast since the November 26 terror strike last year, which was blamed on the Lashkar.        
	Deployment of such huge vessels is unusual during the monsoon.        
	A coast guard official said this was also one of the most intensive drills during monsoon, when bad weather makes surveillance tough. Rain-lashed Mumbai is experiencing the highest tides in a century.        
	Our three offshore vessels are manning every inch of the Mumbai coast to prevent incursions, said a coast guard spokesperson.        
	In addition to this, the coast guards western region has deployed its entire fleet of 34 vessels and 17 choppers and hovercrafts along the 3,341-km-long shoreline covering Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka.        
	The fleet includes Samrat, one of the coast guards six advanced patrol vessels equipped with a helicopter and five high-speed boats. It also has an infra-red system that helps detect targets at night that otherwise escape the radar.        
	The last attack warning, though not as pointed as this one, was received on June 24. Before that, Mumbai police commissioner S. Sivanandan had spoken of an aerial strike but state home minister Jayant Patil had denied it.        
	Today, Patils deputy, minister of state for home Arif Naseem Khan, was more forthcoming on the new threat. We dont know how many terrorists have been entrusted with the mission but there is no information about local operatives (being involved), he said.

                                                                                                               IIT student lies on tracks, but cops reach before train
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lucknow, Feb. 24: An IIT Kanpur student lying on the tracks, waiting for a train to run him over, was rescued last evening by railway police.        
	We found a man lying on the rail tracks and rushed. We overpowered him and he said he was disgusted with life and wanted to kill himself, said Sukesh Yadav, a Government Railway Police (GRP) inspector.        
	Durgesh Vikram, 26, is a PhD student at IIT Kanpur, where he also did his MTech after graduating from IIT Roorkee. His parents are farmers in Muzaffarnagar, IIT sources said.        
	The police informed the IIT, which sent a team to the spot. We immediately sent five trained counsellors to bring him back to the institute, said A.K. Ghosh, director of the counselling centre at IIT Kanpur. Vikram is under medication now and his treatment is being monitored by the counsellors.         
	He is no doubt a bright student, said institute registrar Sanjeev Kashalkar.         
	Ghosh said Vikram had suffered from a behavioural disorder in 2006, for which he was taking medicines for some time.         
	Unfortunately, at the behest of his parents, he stopped taking the medicines. We suspect he relapsed to his old illness after this. We are asking all parents not to take this decision on their own and let us handle the cases or stop medicines after consulting a doctor, Ghosh said.         
	The institute set up the counselling centre in 2007 to help students cope with stress after several students committed suicide unable to handle academic pressure or personal problems.        
	The last suicide was as recently as January 3, when a second-year MTech student took his life after failing to find a job through campus interview. G. Suman came from Nellore in Andhra Pradesh.         
	In the past four years, seven students have committed suicide at IIT Kanpur and several others have attempted it. With every new incident, we feel completely shattered. But we tell everyone that we need some more time to put this system into practice and make it more effective. We will win the battle, Ghosh said.         
	Vikram, who had been feeling low since Sunday, left his hostel room in the afternoon yesterday and reached near Kanpur Central station around 5pm, sources said. He lay down on the tracks, waiting for a train, but the policemen arrived first.        
	IIT Kanpurs counselling centre, which has its own building, 10 trained counsellors and a psychiatrist, have launched an awareness campaign at nearby railway stations and bus stops asking travellers to inform it if any IIT student is found loitering aimlessly or otherwise behaving in an abnormal manner.

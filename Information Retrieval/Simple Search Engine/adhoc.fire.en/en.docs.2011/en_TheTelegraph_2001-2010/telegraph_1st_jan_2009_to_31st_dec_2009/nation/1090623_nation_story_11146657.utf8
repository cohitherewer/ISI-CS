The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | 5 days travel with flu 
                                                                                                               5 days travel with flu 
          G.S. MUDUR                              
	New Delhi, June 22: A 24-year-old man infected with the swine flu virus who flew into Pune from the US, then travelled to Lucknow via Delhi before returning to Pune by plane and trains, may have jeopardised Indias flu containment efforts.         
	The man with fever, a sore throat and cough reported to a public health facility in Pune only on Saturday after returning from Lucknow, five days after he had arrived from the US, health ministry sources said.         
	Public health experts are worried the man may have been shedding the new H1N1 virus during his domestic travel, exposing an unknown number of people to the infection.         
	He had developed fever and cough on June 16  a day after arriving from the US. He flew to Delhi on a domestic airliner on June 16, from where he travelled to Lucknow aboard the Lucknow Mail. He returned to Delhi on a Shatabdi and flew to Pune, sources said.         
	Were really perturbed about this. If he was shedding the virus, his travel from Pune to Lucknow and back has the potential to jeopardise our containment efforts, said a senior health official who requested anonymity.         
	An independent source said the man is a professional in the IT sector.         
	India has been pursuing a strategy of isolating patients infected with the H1N1 virus.         
	The health ministry has urged travellers and doctors to remain alert for flu symptoms.         
	But, the sources said, the man from Pune appears to have escaped the surveillance net. When he developed fever and cough, he did approach a medical facility in Lucknow, but it appears that no one considered the possibility of H1N1, the sources said.         
	Health ministry officials are now trying to figure out just how many people they need to trace and whether such an exercise would be possible at all.         
	In New Delhi, a 66-year-old woman has become Indias first patient infected with the H1N1 pandemic virus to require a ventilator for breathing assistance, health authorities said today.         
	The woman had an underlying illness  chronic obstructive lung disease  for which she had been receiving long-term steroid treatment, health officials said.         
	Indias total number of confirmed H1N1 cases today climbed to 63.

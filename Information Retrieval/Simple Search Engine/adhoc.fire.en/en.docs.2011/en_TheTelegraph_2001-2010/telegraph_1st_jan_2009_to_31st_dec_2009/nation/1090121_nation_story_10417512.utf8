	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 20: Former Union home secretary and commission on Centre-state relations member V.K. Duggal today stressed the need for a joint action plan to be evolved by affected states to combat the Left-wing extremism.        
	We will discuss the issue of Naxalism. Recently, the Centre has come up with a Rs 12,000-crore development package for the Naxalite-hit region, said Duggal, while talking to reporters here on the sidelights of eastern and central region consultation on Centre-state co-operation in combating Naxalism, inaugurated here today.        
	The conference was attended by representatives from governments of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh and Orissa. We will hear the states, which are hit by Naxalite violence. We will also hear the issues that how it all started, what the genesis of the problem was and what needs to be done, said the former Union home secretary.        
	You have to take a two-pronged strategy. You have to take development closer to Naxalite-affected areas; you have to bring social and economic equity. At the same time you cannot expect in a civilised society the rule of gun, he said.        
	Provision of secure, stable and peaceful conditions is a prerequisite for social and economic wellbeing of countrys citizens.         
	It is in this context that the spectre of militancy and Naxalism demands priority attention of policy-makers and implementers, both at the central and state levels, said Justice M.M. Punchhi, the chairperson of commission on centre-state relations, while presiding over the conference.        
	Responding to a query as to whether the communal violence in Kandhamal would be discussed at the conference, Duggal said there was no specific agenda on the issue. But there was a question in questionnaire for maintaining communal harmony in the country and how best it can be ensured.        
	The Kandhamal issue has of course national and international consequences. It is not either in the interest of the state, or the country. So the correct measures are warranted to ensure everybody live happily and peacefully, he said. The purpose of this conference is to address the issues, which are germane to the region, he added.        
	This is the fourth such regional conference and there is one more for western region scheduled next month in Ahmedabad. The role of the mission is to propose constitutional amendments and bring in such other legislative measures, which can smooth the Centre-state relationship, said the commission member.

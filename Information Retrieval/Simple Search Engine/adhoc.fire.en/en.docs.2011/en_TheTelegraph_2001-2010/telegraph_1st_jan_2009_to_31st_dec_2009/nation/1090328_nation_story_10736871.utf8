The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CPM eyes hawkish pals, allies uneasy
                                                                                                               CPM eyes hawkish pals, allies uneasy
          JAYANTH JACOB                           Karat in Delhi on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, March 27: Desperate to cut its projected electoral losses in Bengal and Kerala, the CPM is ignoring unease within and among allies to reach out to new hardline Muslim groups that have no ideological consonance with the Left.         
	Despite its championing of secular politics, the CPMs relations with the Muslim minority have suffered a recent souring. The extended fracas in Nandigram, which has a substantial Muslim population, played a big role in creating disaffection towards the CPM. It has not helped that for different reasons, the party has had to expel two Muslim MPs  Abdullakutty in Kerala and Abu Ayesh Mondal in Bengal  close to the polls.         
	Party leaders are now moving to shore up Muslim support by allying with organisations the CPM had previously criticised as communal. These include the Jamaat-e-Islami Hind and the Jamait Ulema-e-Hind in Bengal and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), led by the controversial Kerala leader Abul Naser Madhani, once accused in the Coimbatore blast case and later acquitted.         
	Both the Jamaats were severe critics of the CPMs role in Nandigram, and the PDP has often been criticised by the party in Kerala. But now, the central leadership is reaching out to the Jamaats  a meeting between Jamaat-e-Islami Hind leaders and Bengal CPM chief, Biman Bose, is on the cards; the CPI, on the other hand, is approaching the Jamait Ulema-e-Hind.         
	CPM leaders have probably come to realise that making manifesto commitments to the minority community is not enough this time, when their fortunes are on the downslide; more pro-active block-building with Muslim organisations, which have no history of allying with the Left, will have to be done.         
	While the CPM is hiding none of its intentions to get the support of the Madhani-led PDP, the partys long-term allies are uncomfortable with it. Differences over the PDP exist within the CPM as well. It is known that Kerala chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan is none too pleased about associating with the PDP but state party secretary Pinarayi Vijayan has repeatedly vouched for the secular character of the PDP.         
	Both the CPI and the RSP maintain that the PDP is a communal party. On its part, the CPM has taken cover in a tactical position  party general secretary Prakash Karat has said that the PDP is not part of the LDF in Kerala, but it has decided to vote for the LDF on its own.         
	A source in the Kerala CPM said that the PDP could be an answer to the Congress-led UDFs IUML in the state in the long run. He admitted that steps like projecting Muslim faces are not enough to get votes, and organisations like the PDP will be of help.         
	There can be differences. Thats why we are different political parties, politburo member S. Ramachandran Pillai had quipped at a news conference a day after differences and unease over the PDP in the Left Front came to the fore.         
	The CPM is clearly in no mood to entertain the disapproval of allies on the issue, because it senses how critical the Muslim vote could be in a tough election.         
	At a news conference, Karat today sought a sub-plan for Muslims on the lines of the tribal sub-plan. This idea was first mooted by Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee with the Planning Commission in 2005 and was rejected.         
	Karat claimed the CPM had gone all out to help the minority community in Bengal, flagging the benefits of land reforms for rural Muslims and the high quotient (20 per cent) of Muslim teachers in primary schools for special mention. The Sachar Committee, he rued, had not taken these into account. But he added that more needs to be done.        
	 The CPM is planning to highlight that 30.9 per cent of the rural households in Bengal are Muslim households having access to 25.6 per cent of the total cultivated land in the state. In Kerala, the corresponding figures are 20 per cent and 16.7 per cent. This, too, is aimed at countering the Sachar report, which did not paint a rosy picture of the state of Muslims in Bengal.         
	The CPM manifesto has made many promises to Muslims. Apart from the sub-plan, they include setting up an equal opportunity commission to address discrimination against Muslims, ensuring 15 per cent of the priority sector lending by banks to Muslims, cheap credit for self-employed youth of the community, special focus on education of Muslim girls, promotion of Urdu language, and more money for the Central Wakf Council.

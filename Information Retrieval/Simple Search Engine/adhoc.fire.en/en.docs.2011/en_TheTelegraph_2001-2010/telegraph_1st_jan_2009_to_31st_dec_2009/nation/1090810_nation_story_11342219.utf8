	Jaipur, Aug. 9: The fate of Rajmata Gayatri Devis will remained a mystery as the 12-day mourning period drew to a close today.        
	The Rang ka Dastoor ceremony got over with family members changing over to colourful clothes from the white mourning attire.        
	The focus then shifted to Gayatri Devis will, although its existence itself had not been confirmed yet.         
	Her property and jewellery  valued at Rs 1,000 crore  are expected to have claimants such as her grandchildren Devraj Kumar and Lalitya Kumari Singh. Other contenders could be her eldest stepson and the present maharaja of Jaipur, Brigadier Bhawani Singh, and the two other stepsons, Jai Singh and Prithviraj Singh.

	Mumbai, Nov. 24 (PTI): Actress Laveena Bhatia was arrested in connection with the murder of an actor, Kunal Singh, who was found dead at his residence in Mumbai in February last year, police said today.         
	Kunal, who had acted in some Bhojpuri films and one Bollywood movie, was found hanging from the ceiling fan.              
	 in his rented first floor apartment in suburban Versova area.        
	His friend and co-star Laveena was in the house when the incident happened.        
	However, in August last year, the Bombay High Court asked police to re-look into Kunals alleged suicide case after victims father Rajendra filed a petition contending that his son did not commit suicide, but was murdered.        
	After the court order, the case was re-investigated and murder case was registered. We suspect Laveenas role in the crime. She was arrested on Sunday under section 302 (punishment for murder) of the IPC, Inspector of Versova police station K Gadekar said.        
	Rajendra had alleged that when he claimed his sons body from the hospital, he had found several injury marks on his arm and chest suggesting that someone strangulated him and later hanged the body from the ceiling to make it look like a suicide.

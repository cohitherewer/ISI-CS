          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Sept. 29: Anoushka Shankar, sitar player and daughter of Pandit Ravi Shankar, has never met the man who has been arrested on the charge of blackmailing her, a statement from the family said.        
	Police sources had earlier quoted Junaid, the alleged extortionist and a Mumbai businessman, as claiming that he knew Anoushka. Junaid has been accused of accessing Anoushkas personal photographs and demanding money in exchange for not making the pictures public.        
	However, a statement issued by Jennifer Braxmeyer, assistant to the Shankars, said today: Anoushka has never met the man who has been arrested. Prior to the investigation, she had never heard his name.        
	The statement also clarified that replies to the alleged extortionists mails were composed by investigators, not by Anoushka. Emails supposedly from Anoushka were actually written by investigators to draw out the extortionist, it said.        
	Though the extortion case became public only recently, this matter has been under investigation for several months by criminal investigators with the Gavin de Becker firm in the US. While Anoushka was made aware of every email sent by the extortionist, replies to the extortionist were actually composed by criminal investigators, not by Anoushka. No content in any email is actually Anoushkas content.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PM balm for Karunanidhi
                                                                                                               PM balm for Karunanidhi
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Singh: Hopeful                                  
	Chennai, May 9: The Prime Minister today met M. Karunanidhi in hospital and reassured him the Congress continued to see him as a post-poll ally.        
	As of now, we are fighting this election in the company of the DMK, and it is our fervent hope that we will maintain this alliance as we form the government, Manmohan Singh told reporters during his Chennai visit.        
	He had been asked if he could state categorically that the Congress would have nothing to do with the ADMK after the elections.        
	Singhs assurance to the DMK, coming after Rahul Gandhis statement that the ADMK was a like-minded party, should speed up the Tamil Nadu chief ministers recovery from his urinary infection.        
	Earlier this week, Sonia Gandhi had set off speculation by cancelling a visit to Chennai for a rally, although her party cited Karunanidhis hospitalisation as the reason. Now, with Sonia set to share a public platform tomorrow with the chief minister  who is to be discharged in the morning  the DMK will be further reassured.        
	Congress support is crucial for the minority DMK governments survival, and it does not want a situation where Jayalalithaa can barter the backing of her MPs to a Congress-led central government in exchange for withdrawal of support to Karunanidhi.        
	Singh provided positive signals to the DMK on the Lankan issue as well. He dismissed Jayalalithaas talk of sending the army to create a Tamil homeland in Sri Lanka. ...It is not easy to march an army to a sovereign state.        
	Nor did Singh take the recent pro-LTTE pronouncements of Karunanidhi too seriously. He said India was a free country and everyone had the right to speak their minds.        
	Singh also dismissed the buzz over the absence of Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan from Fridays cabinet meeting as sensationalisation of trivial issues by the media.

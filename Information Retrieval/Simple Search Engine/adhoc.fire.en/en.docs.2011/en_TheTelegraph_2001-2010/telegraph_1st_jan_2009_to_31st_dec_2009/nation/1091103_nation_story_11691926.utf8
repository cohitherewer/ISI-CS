          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 2: The police commissionerate today arrested three men in connection with the murder of Jharpada special jail warder Manas Nayak.        
	Nayak, who was shot at by two men late last evening, succumbed to his injuries around midnight yesterday. He had received four bullets on his lower abdomen.         
	This morning the force raided Debray College and nabbed Mitu, an aide of gangster Hyder, after an encounter that left him with a bullet injury on his leg. Two pistols, two sharp weapons, nine bullets and four mobile phones were seized from Mitu.        
	Mitu was taken to SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack where he was interrogated, which led to two more arrests. Four others have also been detained in connection with the case and are currently being interrogated. The police, however, have refused to divulge the names of the men who have been taken to custody.        
	With the murder and the arrests, the suspicion of gangsters executing crimes from prisons has been reinforced further.         
	Last evening, Nayak was walking towards his home right outside the prison when he was shot at by two motorcycle-borne men.         
	Before the public could react, the men sped away before pumping in four bullets into Nayak. We heard four shots and saw the warden collapse, said an eyewitness.         
	Nayak was rushed to city-based Ayush Hospital where a team of experts operated on him to remove all four bullets. However, they failed to save the policemans life and he breathed his last after midnight. Home secretary Aditya Padhi and inspector-general of prisons V. Thyagrajan had visited Nayak while he was fighting for his life.         
	The force apprehended that the warder must have tried to enforce strict rules in the jail, which proved costly. Nayak had joined Jharpara jail last month after completing his training. He was a resident of Sinapashi village under Dhenkikote police station of Keonjhar.        
	The crime (murder) was committed to demoralise young warders such as Nayak, who do their work well, Thyagarajan said. Its a challenge not only for the police, but for the entire administration to catch the culprits. We will equip our personnel to give a befitting reply, he added.         
	The state prison service officers demanded adequate protection. Meanwhile, the government has declared an ex gratia of Rs 1 lakh for the family, besides, a government job for a kin.         
	On May 28, 2008, a surprise raid by deputy commissioner of police Himashu Lal at Jharpada jail had led to the seizure of cellphones, dozens of pornographic CDs and contraband drugs.

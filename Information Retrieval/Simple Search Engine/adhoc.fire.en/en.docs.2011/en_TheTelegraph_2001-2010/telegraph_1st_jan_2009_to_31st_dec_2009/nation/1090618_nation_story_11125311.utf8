                                                                                                               Raman no to self, yes to message
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Raipur, June 17: When the state marketing federation proposes, the chief minister disposes.         
	Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh has vetoed an idea of pasting a smiling photograph of himself on salt packets that are to be distributed for free by the government among BPL families. Instead, a stern awareness message is slated to replace the chief ministers photograph.         
	The government will launch the free salt scheme from July 1 to help 37 lakh BPL people get free salt. The scheme, promised by the ruling BJP before the 2008 Assembly polls, will be executed by the states marketing federation. Earlier, the federation designed the packets with a photograph of the chief minister on it.         
	However, Raman Singh was less impressed with the packets and rejected the design, asking officials to put a more meaningful message, something that creates awareness about AIDS, conservation of power or water.        
	Following his (chief ministers) guidelines, we made the necessary changes and now the salt packets will contain a message, said a senior federation official.         
	Though it may be perceived as a humble move, the chief minister is simply being cautious and trying to disarm any possible attacks from the Opposition Congress that may disrupt the ambitious scheme.        
	During the 2002 Congress regime, the then Opposition BJP had attacked the government for pasting pictures of the then chief minister, Ajit Jogi, on schoolbags, distributed for free among students. The BJP had then made the schoolbags quite an issue in the House.         
	However, even if Raman Singh had chosen to put his face on salt packets and stated the example of Jogi on schoolbags, he would not have got off easy. Recently, the Prime Minister barred all departments from using his picture on any documents using central governments schemes.

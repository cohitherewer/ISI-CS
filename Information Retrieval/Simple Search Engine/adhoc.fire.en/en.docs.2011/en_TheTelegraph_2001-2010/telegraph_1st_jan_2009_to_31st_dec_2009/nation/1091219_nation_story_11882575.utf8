	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 18: The Orissa Medical Service Association, a body representing 2,500-odd government doctors, deferred ceasework for two months after the government assured it that its demand for implementation of the Dynamic Assured Career Progression (DACP) would be looked into within three months.        
	The decision came late last night after several rounds of talk between the government and the association members.        
	We have postponed the strike in greater interest of people. We have given two months to the government to decide implementation of the DACP, said Madhusudan Mishra, the association president.

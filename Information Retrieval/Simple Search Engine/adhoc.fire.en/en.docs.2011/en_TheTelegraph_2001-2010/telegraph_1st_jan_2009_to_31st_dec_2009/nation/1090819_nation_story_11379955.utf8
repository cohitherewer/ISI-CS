The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | House rent ruling 
                                                                                                               House rent ruling 
                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 18 (PTI): A government employee is not entitled to house rent allowance if he or she is residing with a spouse who has been allotted government accommodation, Delhi High Court said today.         
	The ruling came on a petition filed by a government employee challenging the Centres order directing her to refund the HRA paid to her for nine years during which she was living with her husband in government accommodation.         
	Justice Sunil Gaur dismissed the petition of Rajni Devi, a hostel warden in National Bal Bhawan, and ordered her to return Rs 1.19 lakh which she got as HRA between 1996 and 2005.         
	Since the petitioner is not able to justify the payment of house rent allowance made to her, she has no reasonable justification to retain it. Therefore, no fault can be found in the governments order directing the recovery of the HRA paid to her, Gaur said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Shillong, July 5: Social networking has landed a Shillong college girl in trouble after a man she got acquainted with on the Internet allegedly abducted her when she went to meet him in Bangalore.         
	Shenaz Rymbai, the mother of 22-year-old Sahana, today said she filed an FIR on the night of June 29 after her daughter did not return home from college.         
	Today, the president of the Civil Society Womens Organisation, Agnes Kharshiing, who met Sahanas relatives, said the girl and Sameer Gafoor of Bangalore had been chatting online for several months.         
	Kharshiing said Sahana told her mother that Sameer had polio.        
	Kharshiing said Sameer had posted his passport-size photo on a social networking site and claimed to have several business establishments in Bangalore. In the last week of June, he invited Sahana to come to Bangalore to meet him.         
	Sahana boarded a Guwahati-Bangalore flight with Rs 15,000. Two days later, when she replied to her mothers frantic calls, she told her Sameer and his relatives had met her at Bangalore airport.         
	She was made to wear a burqa and instructed to speak in Hindi and not in her mother tongue Khasi, Sahana told her mother. The same day, when Shenaz again dialled her daughters number, an anonymous voice demanded Rs 5 lakh for Sahanas release.         
	Initially, the alleged kidnapper asked Sahanas relatives to deposit Rs 5 lakh in an account of Karnatak Bank (gramin).         
	Later, he asked Shenaz to come to the Bangalore airport with the ransom amount.         
	Bangalore police are trying to find Sahana.

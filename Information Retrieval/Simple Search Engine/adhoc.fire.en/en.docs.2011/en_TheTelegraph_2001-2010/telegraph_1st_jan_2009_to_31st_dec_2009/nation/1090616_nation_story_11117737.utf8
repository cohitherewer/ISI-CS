The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Inaction rage erupts at Buddha meet 
                                                                                                               Inaction rage erupts at Buddha meet 
          BISWAJIT ROY                          Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee                                  
	Calcutta, June 15: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today came under intense pressure from Left legislators to abandon the hands-off policy in places where cadres were being targeted by Maoists or the Trinamul Congress.        
	The CPM state secretariat would hold an emergency meeting tomorrow in view of growing lawlessness in several parts of the state.         
	Tempers flared up at a meeting called to ensure floor co-ordination among Left MLAs during the Assembly budget session that began today.        
	Do you think we should continue to get battered by the Opposition while the administration remains a spectator? a source quoted Sushanta Ghosh, the minister in charge of development of western Bengal and the CPM strongman in West Midnapore, as having asked the chief minister.        
	An upset Bhattacharjee tried to reason with his angry colleagues, reminding them that they were part of the government.        
	The chief minister requested them to calm down and bear with him. Dont speak in terms of counter-violence either here or outside as they (the Opposition) are actually provoking us to do that. I am aware of the incidents and have asked police to take appropriate action. I urge you to maintain restraint and go for intensive campaign among the people against their designs, a participant quoted Bhattacharjee as saying.         
	The chief ministers comments betrayed the dilemma of the government and the party  if the police or the cadres are let loose, any flare-up in violence could backfire as it did in Nandigram and take a toll during the Assembly polls in 2011.        
	But so sharp was the anger among some Left MLAs that they made a few intemperate remarks within the earshot of the chief minister while he was wrapping up the meeting.        
	RSP MLAs did not join the meeting today. But RSP veteran Kshiti Goswami said the partys legislative meeting was held at the same time because of a miscommunication.         
	During the meeting, several legislators voiced anguish at the police inaction in Lalgarh and Khejuri. According to the participants, CPM legislators from East and West Midnapore, Burdwan and Cooch Behar slammed the changed attitude of the police.        
	They complained that the police stood by when Trinamul supporters and Maoists killed CPM leaders, torched party offices, ransacked leaders homes and stopped ministers from visiting affected comrades.        
	Why cant the administration and the police provide protection to peoples representatives? It can happen to us also, said the CPMs Burdwan MLA Pradip Tah, referring to the murder of district committee member Falguni Mukherjee today.         
	Among the allies, CPI MLAs empathised with the CPM most. The CPI, too, is feeling threatened following the Trinamul and Maoist advance in East and West Midnapore.         
	Echoing CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan, party veteran and state minister Nandagopal Bhattacharya accused the administration of being almost paralysed and inactive.        
	The changes in the police attitude suggest that its not us but the Opposition that is in the saddle in the state. What is your administration doing? the CPIs West Midnapore MLA, Chittadas Thakur, asked at the meeting.         
	A team of front MLAs from East and West Midnapore later met home secretary Ardhendu Sen at Writers Buildings.         
	Caught in the dilemma, the party is now pinning hopes on the chief ministers meeting with the Prime Minister on June 19. According to party sources, Bhattacharjee would urge the Prime Minister to ensure a Centre-state joint crackdown in Maoist-held Lalgarh.

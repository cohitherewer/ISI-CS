          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, June 9: He joined the rebel ranks dreaming of a new life. Now, quitting it, he has finally found it.        
	Maoist leader Akash, alias Ghasiram Majhi, 28, will be allotted homestead land and a home-building assistance up to Rs 25,000 after he surrendered with daughter and wife yesterday before Raygada superintendent of police Ashish Kumar Singh.        
	The retired rebels benefits include eligibility to avail of an interest-free bank loan of around Rs 2 lakh, free medical treatment in state government hospitals and a fee waiver and free textbooks for his children till high school.        
	Talking to reporters today, the visibly frustrated rebel leader complained about his seniors, especially those he refers to as the Telegu-speaking hardcore Maoists.         
	Akash was involved in more than 50 crimes, including murder, extortion and sabotage. He joined the cadre in 2002 and is considered the fourth in line after Oriya leaders Sabyasachi, Azad and Basant. He has more than 48 cases pending against him, said Singh.        
	Akash rued the erosion of ideals that led him to embrace the path in the first place. The original policy of protecting the poor from middlemen has failed, he said, adding that the young cadre were being cheated by their leaders.         
	Akash, a leader in the Vamsadhara division, was also involved in the February 2009s Nayagarh massacre along with wife Jharana.

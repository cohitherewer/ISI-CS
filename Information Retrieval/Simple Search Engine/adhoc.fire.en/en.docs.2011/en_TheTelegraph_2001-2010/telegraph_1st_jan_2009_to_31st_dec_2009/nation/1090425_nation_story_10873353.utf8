The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sabotage stench in Anil chopper 
                                                                                                               Sabotage stench in Anil chopper 
  - Pebbles set off murder plot scare        PIYA SINGH AND SATISH NANDGAONKAR                          A Bell 412 helicopter, not the one owned by Anil Ambani                                        
	Mumbai, April 24: Anil Ambani fears that business rivals may be gunning for his life and could have connived with miscreants to sabotage his helicopter that was undergoing a routine maintenance check last evening.        
	The dramatic statement was made in a letter sent to Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan and other government and police officials demanding an investigation into the act of sabotage on the Bell 412 helicopter that was due to fly Ambani to Navi Mumbai this morning.         
	The sabotage was detected after a maintenance technician found that the filler cap on the top of the helicopter had been tampered with. Closer inspection revealed that someone had pushed pebbles and gravel in the filler neck.Ambani was due to take a 13-minute flight from Mahalaxmi in downtown Mumbai to the Reliance Communications headquarters in Dhirubhai Ambani Knowledge City in Navi Mumbai along with a few senior officials.         
	This is clearly an attempt to murder, Captain Raghvinder Nath Joshi, the 52-year-old pilot of Reliance Transport and Travels, said in his complaint to the chief minister.        
	Besides Chavan, the letter was sent to state home minister Jayant Patil, chief secretary Johny Joseph, police commissioner Hassan Gafoor and joint commissioner of police Rakesh Maria.         
	Maria confirmed he had received the letter. We are forming a special team to look into the matter.         
	Bharat Borge, a senior technician of Airworks India Engineering Pvt Ltd, the company that has been maintaining the helicopter since October 2006, discovered that the filler cap hadnt been properly screwed on, the letter said.        
	When Borge opened the filler cap, which is about 10 feet from the ground and on top of the helicopter, he saw pebbles and gravel in the filler neck, the letter said. Borge noticed the same only by luck or coincidence, Joshi said.         
	The letter said the helicopter could have taken off with the foreign material but the pebbles would have entered the gear box and caused a mid-air loss of power, resulting in a forced landing and loss of lives.         
	He said the sabotage was carried out under the guidance of somebody who had knowledge of helicopters.         
	The senior pilot also alleged that the incident would not have been possible without the active involvement and aid of the persons working for Airworks. Airworks director Ravi Menon declined comment. Airworks is believed to have suspended several employees.         
	The police have taken four employees of Airworks for questioning. Airworks maintains fleets of several companies, including Reliance Industries, Essar group, JSW and DLF.         
	Former director-general of civil aviation, H.S. Khola, stressed it was important to find out the nature of the particles before concluding whether these could have caused a crash. I wouldnt venture that far (to say it would have caused a crash). It would depend on the quality and quantity of the material. But it is undoubtedly undesirable and a safety hazard, Khola said.        
	The younger Ambani drove his white Range Rover to Navi Mumbai himself instead of taking his usual 13-minute chopper ride to beat the traffic, and reached an hour and 15 minutes late. The helicopter is unlikely to be fit for use before four or five days.

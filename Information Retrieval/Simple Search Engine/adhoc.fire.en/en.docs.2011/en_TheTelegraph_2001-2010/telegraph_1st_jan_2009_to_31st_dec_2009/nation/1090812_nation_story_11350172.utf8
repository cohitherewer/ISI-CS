The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Governor reluctant, Trinamul not so
                                                                                                               Governor reluctant, Trinamul not so
          OUR BUREAU                            Gopalkrishna Gandhi, Manmohan Singh                                 
	New Delhi, Aug. 11: Bengal governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi today told Prime Minister Manmohan Singh he didnt want an extension after his tenure ends in December, official sources said.         
	However, asked by reporters later whether he wanted to continue, Gandhi sounded non-committal. That is not for me to handle, he said, pointing out that his term was ending in the next four months (December 13).        
	Trinamul Congress has already started saying the party prefers another term for the governor. If the pitch rises to a formal demand, it will become a test for a resolve in the Congress and the UPA government not to give extensions to governors. It is also not known how Gandhi will react if the Centre eventually asks him to continue.        
	Gandhi, who met Singh principally to discuss the commemoration of the Dandi Salt March undertaken by Mahatma Gandhi in 1930, discussed the state of law and order in Bengal, the recent political violence and the situation in Darjeeling against the backdrop of the tripartite talks on Gorkhaland today, the sources said.        
	The governor chairs the Gandhi Heritage Committee, which is advising the Centre and the Gujarat government on their joint endeavour to develop a Dandi Heritage Corridor extending from Ahmedabads Sabarmati Ashram to Dandi in Navsari.        
	The governor is well accepted and loved by the people of Bengal, said Sudip Bandopadhyay, Trinamuls chief whip in the Lok Sabha. Trinamul sources said that in their internal meetings, Mamata Banerjee had said she would like Gandhi to continue.        
	She views him as a balancing force in Bengals political equations. The positions he has taken have been critical in denouncing the state terror unleashed by CPM goons, a leader said.        
	The Congress-led government had in principle taken a decision not to give incumbent governors a second term to equitably distribute the fruits of patronage and give the several hopefuls in line a chance. In the latest shuffle, loyalists such as Balram Jakhar and R.L. Bhatia, hoping for extended stints in Raj Bhavans, were pensioned off.        
	The governors who were transferred to other states were those waiting to serve out their terms.        
	A section of the Congress believes that Gandhis presence could lend weight to its campaign with Trinamul against the Left Front before the 2011 Bengal elections. But the Congress might not put itself out to ensure he stays on. Much depends on the extent to which the Trinamul influences the decision. However, we are clear on one thing: if he is replaced, the successor will have to be a hard-core political entity and not a former bureaucrat, a source said.        
	Gandhi told reporters that at his 45-minute meeting with the Prime Minister, they had spoken about the need to renounce violence. We talked about the importance of all political entities and everyone in public life shunning violence and following the path of peace, the governor said.        
	The Left had rapped him for his statement of August 6 in which he said Bengal was witnessing a tandava of violence after the Lok Sabha results, and called him partisan.

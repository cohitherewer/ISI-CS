          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                      Anjali Waghmare outside a court in Mumbai on Wednesday. (PTI)                          
	Mumbai, April 1: A composed Anjali Waghmare today shrugged off protests to assert she would continue to defend Mohammad Ajmal Kasab, the lone terrorist captured during the 26/11 attacks, in the interest of justice.        
	Waghmare, married to an assistant police inspector, arrived at the special court along with a posse of armed guards and informed the judge she would continue representing Kasab.        
	The 40-year-old lawyer had appeared jolted by Mondays midnight ruckus by Shiv Sena activists at her house in the Worli police quarters. The Sena claimed she gave them an assurance she would withdraw from the case. Yesterday, she requested the court to grant her a days time to think.        
	But today, Waghmare made it clear she would stick to her stand to fulfil legal requirements. Yes, I will continue with the case, she told special court judge M.L. Tahiliyani.         
	The court then appointed K.P. Pawar, also from the state legal aid cell, to assist her.         
	Speaking to reporters outside the court, Waghmare said the governments assurance that she would be provided adequate security throughout the trial and her familys support had helped her make up her mind.         
	As long as the government is providing me adequate security, I do not have a problem, said Waghmare. I never anticipated the attack on me. There is a threat to my life, but I am doing this in the interest of justice, she added, but admitted she was stressed after the attack.        
	Joint commissioner of police (crime) Rakesh Maria refused to specify the security details. We have given adequate security to Waghmare and Pawar. We would not like to specify the category of security cover, he said.         
	Crime branch sources, however, said Waghmare has been given Z category cover which includes protection by 22 personnel and an escort vehicle.         
	Special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam said Waghmares decision would clear the way for the trial. It is a good decision. There will be no impediment in further progress of the trial. We would like to complete the trial in six months, he said.        
	Sena activists had earlier forced another lawyer, Ashok Sarogi, to withdraw after having agreed to defend Kasab.         
	Waghmare said her attackers should be let off. They will take time to understand. They were emotional because I am a policemans wife. Once they know in what circumstances I have taken this up, they will understand.         
	The protest at Waghmares house was triggered when Eknath Oomble, a cousin of 26/11 hero Tukaram Oomble, tried to enter her house with local Shiv Sena activists and intimidate her. Oomble, a police constable, died while trying to capture Kasab alive and was awarded the Ashok Chakra.        
	Eknath Oomble works as a deputy head of the Worli Shiv Sena unit and was upset that Waghmare, the wife of a policeman, had agreed to take up Kasabs case.         
	Tukaram Oombles family condemned the attack. Speaking to The Telegraph, the slain constables daughter Vaishali said: We do not support the attack and protest against Waghmare. We didnt know Eknath Oomble was planning a protest. He did it on behalf of the Shiv Sena.        
	Vaishali, who is completing her diploma in teacher education, said she was upset that a policemans wife chose to defend the terrorist.         
	We have no objections to any other lawyer representing Kasab, but not a policemans wife. But she is free to take her decision. We only want a speedy trial and a death sentence for Kasab, said Vaishali, who lives at the police quarters with mother Tara, and a younger sister who is completing her final year of BCom.

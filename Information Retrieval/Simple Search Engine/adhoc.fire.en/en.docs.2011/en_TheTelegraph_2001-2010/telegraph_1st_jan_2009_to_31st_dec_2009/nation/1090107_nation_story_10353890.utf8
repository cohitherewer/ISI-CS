The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CBI rapped for Mulayam flip-flop
                                                                                                               CBI rapped for Mulayam flip-flop
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 6: The Supreme Court today pulled up the CBI for flip-flops in the disproportionate assets case against Mulayam Singh Yadav.         
	The court questioned the agencys plea to withdraw an earlier application in which it had said there was no need to send a probe report to the Centre. Now, the agency says it wants to inform the Centre.        
	Justifying the change in stance, the CBI said it had received representations from the respondents (Mulayam and his family) about the allegations.         
	The court wasnt convinced. You had earlier said that you are an independent body, not under anyones control, you are not bound to submit reports to any government, Justice Altamas Kabir, part of a two-judge bench, said as it questioned the turnaround.        
	CBI counsel Gopal Subramanium said sending a report didnt mean the agency wouldnt fulfil the courts mandate to pursue the matter to its logical conclusion. But the judge retorted: But should it be sent to the central government?

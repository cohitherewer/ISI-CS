      9 days to go*      * for first day of polls              
	Barc to ballot      
	Mumbai: Now that he has more time on hand after his retirement from Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (Barc) two months ago, Sailen Kumar Ghosh has decided to plug the cause of scientists.    
	The 60-year-old former food technologist, with a doctorate in engineering, has jumped into the fray as an Independent from Mumbai South-Central and identified three issues to highlight on his campaign.    
	Right on top of the list is his desire to bring in more accountability within the scientific community.    
	Our science bodies have failed to address national issues related to poverty alleviation or food and energy crisis. They still depend on government funding rather than generating wealth for the nation, he said.    
	There should be a central monitoring system to assess viability of programmes and total accountability.    
	The second thing Ghosh would fight for is a revision in service conduct rules created in British times. This would bring in more transparency in the system, he said.    
	Ghosh would also try to set up a scientists rights commission on the lines of the Human Rights Commission.    
	Priya bother    
	Mumbai: Priya Dutt couldnt reach the suburban district collectors office in time to file her nomination on Monday because of a traffic jam caused by her own supporters.    
	The sitting Congress MP from Mumbai North Central had planned to file her papers at 2.15pm.    
	However, hundreds of her supporters had come to see her file her nomination, causing a huge traffic snarl at Kherwadi. Unfortunately, Priyajis car got trapped in it, her spokesperson Krishna Hegde said.    
	She got off her car and took an auto through a back road to the collectors office but the 3pm deadline was over by then. What was supposed to take 15 minutes took one and a half hours.     
	Tuesday being a holiday because of Mahavir Jayanti, Priya will file her nomination on Wednesday, Hedge said.    
	Hand in hand    
	Mumbai: Sonia Gandhi and NCP ally Sharad Pawar will share the dais at a rally at Sakoli in Bhandara district on April 10.    
	Union civil aviation minister Praful Patel (NCP) is contesting the Bhandara-Gondia seat. The rally was earlier supposed to be held in Lakhani and addressed by the Congress chief alone. Sonia will then address three more meetings for party candidates  Naresh Pugalia (Chandrapur), Haribhau Rathod (Yavatmal) and Mukul Wasnik (Ramtek).

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 30: A woman Maoist, involved in the loot of the Nayagarh armoury last year, has surrendered before the police to dodge her seniors who were pressuring her to marry a rebel from Chattisgarh against her wishes.        
	I was in love with Raju, a tribal youth. But my seniors were forcing me to marry Sitesh, a cadre from Chhattisgarh, Laxmi Pidikaka, alias Sunita, told reporters after surrendering before the Rayagada police today.        
	The 18-year-old said she had decided to quit the Maoist outfit to escape from the clutches of her seniors. I told my bosses that I wanted to meet my parents and came to Rayagada. On reaching Rayagada, I contacted the police and surrendered, she said.        
	The young woman, who belonged to Gulunda village under Gudari police station in Rayagada, had joined the CPI(Maoist) in 2006. She was the area committee member of Jangudi Dalam. She had been initiated into the outlawed outfit by rebel leader Uday, who is now behind bars for his involvement in murder of Swami Laxmanananda Saraswati on August 23, 2008 night.         
	Sunita confessed that she had taken part in the loot of armoury at Nayagarh town on February 15, 2008. She is wanted in a dozen crimes in Rayagada and Gajapati districts, said Rayagada superintendent of police Asish Kumar Singh.         
	Singh said Sunita, who was the third active Maoist rebel to surrender before them, would be provided adequate security.        
	On June 8, Maoist Akash, alias Ghasiram Majhi, had surrendered before the police along with wife Jharana, as he was frustrated with the high-handedness of his seniors.         
	On July 22, Surendra Brekedda (20) and wife Jaya Ruppy (19), both members of the Bansadhara division of CPI(Maoist), had surrendered before the police.

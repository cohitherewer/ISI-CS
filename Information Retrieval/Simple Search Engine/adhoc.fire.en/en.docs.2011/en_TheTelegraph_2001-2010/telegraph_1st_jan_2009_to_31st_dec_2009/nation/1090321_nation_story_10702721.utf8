The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sound amp; fury, but little safety for kids or women
                                                                                                               Sound amp; fury, but little safety for kids or women
										      CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                                
	New Delhi, March 20: Attack women in pubs in front of TV cameras and Renuka Chowdhury will give you a mouthful. But no amount of noise has checked crimes against women, which continue to rise as they did five years back.        
	The outrage that followed the Nithari massacre brought in change  women and child development minister Chowdhury set up a national panel specifically tasked with ensuring the rights of children.        
	But even two years after Nithari, children continue to disappear from cities. Distraught parents have no option but to blame police who remain insensitive to cases of missing children.        
	The UPA took some unprecedented steps aimed at focusing on the vulnerability of women and children. It peppered its five-year term with frequent promises of laws and schemes to increase their security.        
	But despite Chowdhurys repeated, and possibly well-intentioned histrionics, most of these promises have not been fulfilled.        
	In late 2005, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh cleaved Arjun Singhs human resource development ministry to create, at Sonia Gandhis request, a separate ministry for women and children.        
	The following year, then finance minister P. Chidambaram introduced the concept of gender budgeting  each government arm would have to set aside 33 per cent of its annual allocations specifically for women.        
	The UPA in 2006 introduced a path-breaking legislation to curb domestic violence, without flinching at opposition from male groups.        
	In 2007, Pratibha Patil was elected the countrys first woman head of state.         
	But the UPA government is likely to be remembered more for its failures towards women and children than its few successes.        
	It promised in the common minimum programme that it would squeeze through Parliament 33 per cent reservations for women within six months of assuming power.         
	Five years later, the bill is with a parliamentary standing committee that has pondered over its contents but abstained from passing a verdict. This bill is not the only one that has fallen victim to differences within the UPA.        
	Chowdhury battled health minister Anbumani Ramadoss to penalise clients visiting brothels under planned amendments to the Immoral Trafficking Prevention Act. She argued, like John Maynard Keynes, that demand drives supply.        
	She managed to convince a group of ministers, headed by former home minister Shivraj Patil, on the need for the amendments, but the National AIDS Control Organisation stalled the proposed changes.        
	The Naco argued that punishing clients would only drive prostitution underground, making contraceptive distribution harder.        
	Chowdhury also promised a law to tackle acid attacks, to toughen punishment against rape and sati and legislation against sexual harassment in the workplace.        
	She vowed to amend the law against indecent representation of women to include depictions through text messaging and MMS.        
	But none of these laws and proposed amendments has reached the cabinet.        
	Children for the first time merited a separate chapter in the 11th five-year plan, Chowdhury announced last year to point out her governments commitment to the young.        
	But the single largest new programme for children, the Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS), planned to prevent a second Nithari, never took off.        
	The ministry increased the salaries of anganwadi workers by 50 per cent, meeting a long pending demand. It finalised plans to provide each worker a sari designed by the National Institute of Fashion Technology as uniform.        
	But the ministry had to swallow an embarrassing reprimand from the Supreme Court for failing to start an adequate number of anganwadis to cater to Indias children under the age of six.        
	Chowdhury tried to convince her cabinet colleagues that freshly cooked meals, currently provided at most anganwadis for children, should be replaced by fortified, pre-cooked snacks. She failed.        
	In 2007, after the Nithari killings, Chowdhury set up the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights with the specific mandate to protect the rights of children.        
	One of the commissions first tasks was to prepare and maintain a database of missing children  18 months later, no such database exists.         
	Chowdhury questioned Mayavatis commitment to girls and women after an Uttar Pradesh police officer commented on the character of 15-year-old Noida girl Aarushi Talwar, murdered in her own house last year.        
	Earlier this year, when activists of the Sri Ram Sena allegedly attacked girls at a pub in Mangalore, Chowdhury fired repeated salvos from a distance of 2,500km.        
	But the governments own statistics, collated by the National Crime Records Bureau, confirm that Indian cities are today more unsafe for women and girls than ever before.        
	Topping the list of unsafe cities is the UPAs seat of power  Delhi.

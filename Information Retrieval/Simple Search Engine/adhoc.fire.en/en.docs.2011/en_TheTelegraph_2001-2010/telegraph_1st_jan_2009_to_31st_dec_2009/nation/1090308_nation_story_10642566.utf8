      40 days to go*    * For first day of polls                              
	 Hyderabad: Two former ministers are among 143 political leaders  big and small  who have changed parties in Andhra Pradesh since the elections were announced.          
	S.V. Subba Reddy, a former minister in the Chandrababu Naidu government, joined the Congress on Friday. A prominent faction leader in Kurnool, he had got isolated in the Telugu Desam Party after his son-in-law Bhooma Nagi Reddy and daughter Shoba Nagi Reddy joined Chiranjeevis Praja Rajyam.          
	If Desam lost Reddy, it gained Maganti Babu. The minister in the Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy government who was dropped in February left the Congress for the Desam on Friday.          
	The ministers head an army of ticket-seekers, including ex-MPs and former ministers, switching sides .           
	Some have even gone over to the Praja Rajyam, which is set to play spoiler on the strength of Chiranjeevis popularity and the support of the dominant Kapu community.          
	Its not only defections that are mounting, complaints with the Election Commission are also piling up. The Desam and the Congress are both rushing to report the other for violation of the model code of conduct.           
	We have received 153 complaints on model code of conduct violations in the last three days, I.V. Subba Rao, the chief election officer in Andhra, said on Friday.          
	 Kottayam: The national flag is off L.K. Advanis campaign website. The Mahatma Gandhi Foundation based at Palai, near here, had pointed that the Tricolour should not be used in the election campaign or for advertisement. The BJP accepted the point and removed the flag from the website.          
	 Pune: NCP president Sharad Pawar announced he would contest from Madha in Solapur district to honour the wishes of party workers. His daughter, Supriya Sule, is expected to get his Baramati seat in neighbouring Pune. Pawar refused to comment on the friction between the Shiv Sena and the BJP over the Senas support for him as Prime Minister, save to say the party had been consistently backing Marathi manoos for top posts. He cited its support for Pratibha Patil as President, though she belongs to the Congress.

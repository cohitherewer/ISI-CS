          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gangtok, April 17: Ten labourers from Bengal are feared killed in a flash flood in the Rongli river, two of them trying to save the others.         
	The labourers were working in a tunnel that is part of the 99MW Chushajen hydel power project being developed by Gati Infrastructure Limited, about 60km from here in east Sikkim.         
	Heavy rain had flooded the catchment area and the 120-metre-long tunnel was hit by a flash flood in the Tsomgo Lake (Changu) from where the Rongli originates, said B.K. Khabrani, the project general manager.        
	The surge in the river, a Teesta tributary, broke through a concrete dam being built 10km away and entered the tunnel around 9.30pm.        
	Eighteen labourers were at work, of whom eight were inside the tunnel, police said. When those outside spied danger, two of them rushed into the tunnel to warn their fellow workers but got trapped with them.         
	The police said there was little likelihood of finding survivors. Water was being pumped out of the tunnel but heavy rain this morning hit the search operation.        
	Khabrani said all the workers were from Bengal. Yesterdays incident will put back our project schedule for at least three months, he added.        
	Rongli subdivisional police officer R.K. Sundas said a case had been registered against the project developers.

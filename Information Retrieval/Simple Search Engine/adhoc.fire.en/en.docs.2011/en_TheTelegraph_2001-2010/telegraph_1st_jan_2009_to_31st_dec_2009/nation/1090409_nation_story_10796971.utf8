The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pawar on Naveen stage
                                                                                                               Pawar on Naveen stage
                            
	Bhubaneswar, April 8 (PTI): Sharad Pawar today said he had kept all options open on a post-poll alliance, though he was in the UPA now.        
	The NCP leader made the comments after addressing a rally with Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaiks Biju Janata Dal (BJD) earlier in the day. He had skipped the BJD-Left roadshow last week.         
	Pawars absence had set off speculation about whether he would eventually join the BJD-Left front.        
	But CPM leader Sitaram Yechury, who also took part in todays rally, said theirs was not a front but adjustments of seats between several parties. He made it clear the aim of the arrangement was to ensure Patnaiks victory in the Orissa polls.        
	Pawar, too, said the combination was Orissa specific. What we are doing is a conscious decision, the NCP leader said. On the race for Delhi, Pawar said as of now he was with the Congress-led UPA but did not know what would happen after the elections.         
	If no party is able to secure a clear majority, all secular parties should sit together and discuss formation of a government at the Centre, he said.

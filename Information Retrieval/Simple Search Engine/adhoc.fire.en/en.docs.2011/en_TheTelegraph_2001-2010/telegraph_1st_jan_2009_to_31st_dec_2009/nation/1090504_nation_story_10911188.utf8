	Bhubaneswar, May 3: A 12-year-old girl who ran away after being beaten up by her employers was rescued by Keonjhar police today.         
	She had fled yesterday after being beaten up by the lady of the house where she had been working as a domestic help for a year. My employers used to beat me up regularly. On Saturday, madam asked me to look for a hair clip. When I failed to find it, she hit me with a sharp weapon, said Ruma from the Balani hospital bed. She has not yet identified her employers.        
	Bhubaneswar police rescued eight children who arrived to work at a construction site.

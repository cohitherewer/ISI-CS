	Srinagar, July 4: Kashmirs high court today ordered the bodies of two women raped and murdered in the southern Shopian district be exhumed for another autopsy if their families agreed, as the Valley seethed even a month after the twin violations.        
	The court also reconstituted the team probing the incident, asked the Government Medical College principal to depute two doctors to supervise the exhumation and ordered, if necessary, narco-analysis tests on five suspended police personnel, accused of destroying evidence.

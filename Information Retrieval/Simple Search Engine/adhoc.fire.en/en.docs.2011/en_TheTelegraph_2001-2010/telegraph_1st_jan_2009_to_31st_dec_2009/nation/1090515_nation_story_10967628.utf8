The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Varun freed of NSA
                                                                                                               Varun freed of NSA
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 14: The Supreme Court today quashed the use of the National Security Act against Varun Gandhi after the Mayavati government, in an apparent change of heart, appeared uninterested in putting up a fight.        
	The Uttar Pradesh government will forthwith revoke the detention order, the court said, and the state government this evening announced it had complied with the court order.        
	The state had moved the apex court against a recommendation by the UP (Detentions) Advisory Board to revoke the NSA order against the BJP candidate from Pilibhit, but it fielded a depleted legal team today at a time of post-poll permutations.        
	The first thing that struck one was that though senior counsel Harish N. Salve was present, he did not represent the government. At the previous hearing, Salve had argued passionately for the detention of Varun under the NSA.        
	Today, advocate-general Jyotendra Mishra and standing counsel Shail Dwivedi appeared before the bench. Mishra did not make even a token attempt to defend the states case.        
	When Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan goaded the state to defend its decision, all Mishra offered was that the advisory board had not heard the district magistrate of Pilibhit but only the additional district magistrate.        
	These are not grounds on which the board decision can be challenged, the court said. The ADM was present; he must have been instructed by the DM.        
	The court added that a notice had been issued stating the date for the board hearing. Why were you not present? it asked. Mishra quickly said the state was willing to revoke the detention order.         
	Varuns plea for damages was, however, not accepted.        
	Varun was detained under the NSA on March 29 after allegedly making a hate speech against Muslims in Pilibhit. The apex court granted him parole on April 16 pending its decision on the legality of the use of the NSA against him.        
	Varuns counsel Mukul Rohatgi accused the state of violating his fundamental rights to life and liberty.        
	Varun, however, faces another criminal case, lodged under orders from the Election Commission over his alleged hate speeches.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 18: The annual plan size for the state for 2009-10 has been pegged at Rs 9,500 crore.         
	The sum was finalised at a meeting with deputy chairman of the planning commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia with finance minister Prafulla Chandra Ghadei at New Delhi last evening. The called sum is Rs 2,000 crore more than the present years plan of Rs 7,500 crore.        
	Ghadei said that Orissa has been striving to improve its fiscal health and plan performance and has increased annual plan outlays about four times from Rs 2,500 crore in 2004-05 to Rs 9,500 crore in 2009-10. Such substantial rise in plan size has been possible because of strong fiscal reforms that have been undertaken in the state in the past years.         
	Because of our efforts, we were able to achieve an average annual growth rate of 9.15 per cent in 10th plan as against the target of 6.2 per cent. We aim to maintain the tempo, he added.         
	Sources said Ahluwaliah lauded the governments efforts and agreed to the proposal.         
	While on one hand the finance minister highlighted on the states achievements in fiscal performance, on the other hand he demanded a onetime special package of Rs 1,500 crore from the Centre to overcome the impacts of the global slump.         
	There are visible signs (of the slowdown) in various fronts and the Centre has already announced special packages in different sectors. Besides, the implementation of the 6th Pay Commissions recommendations has put pressure on the states finances because of sudden growth in expenditure, said Ghadei. This has resulted in less availability of resources for plan financing. Ghadei highlighted several initiatives of the government that were aimed at broad-based and inclusive growth, faster development and accelerated poverty reduction.         
	He also urged the Centre to provide greater assistance to less developed states for infrastructure development including expansion of railway network and creation of expressways such as Ranchi-Vijayawada highway.         
	He requested the Centre to modify the guidelines of the Accelerated Power Distribution Reform Programme, so that the states such as Orissa, adversely impacted because of power sector reforms, may benefit.         
	Other demands included expeditious approval of an eight-year perspective plan worth Rs 4,550 crore for development saturation of KBK region and passing on the proceeds of export duty, levied on chrome ore and minerals, to originating states.

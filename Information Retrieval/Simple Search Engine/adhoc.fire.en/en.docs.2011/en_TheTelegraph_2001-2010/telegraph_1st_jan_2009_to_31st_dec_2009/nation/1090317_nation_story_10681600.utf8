	New York, March 16: Kanushree Jain, 19, knew many details about her parents migration from India to New York, but not about the hostility they faced as new arrivals 17 years ago.        
	The hostility came from their fellow immigrants from India, and the reason was that Jains parents could not speak English.        
	Jain, born in India, was then just two. She has just learnt from her mother how rough the transition was for her because she was not welcomed by neighbours. With Jains father at work most of the day, her mother had to learn the ropes on her own.        
	It was hard to make friends with other ethnicities because we didnt know English, she told her class at Hunter College, New York.        
	And our Indian neighbours, a lot of them, they tend to make fun of other struggling Indians  I guess to make themselves feel better because they were also struggling at one point.        
	Although children of immigrants may generally know the broad arc of their parents lives, the details  of lives lived before America, of hardships in leaving and struggles to adapt  are frequently lost in the rush of assimilation, a time of forging ahead rather than looking back.        
	And so it is that each year, Nancy Foner, professor of sociology at Hunter, requires the students in her course, The Peopling of New York, to interview a close relative about the familys recent history. The discoveries are often startling, to the students as well as to their classmates.        
	Pakistani American Sameer Khan, 18, has found out that his father gave up his career as an agronomist to work at a gas station and a discount store to create a new life for his family. Growing up, I thought I knew everything about my parents, Khan said. What I found writing this story was that I felt I had ignored their struggles.        
	Khan was born in Lubbock, Texas, while his father was pursuing a PhD in agriculture at Texas Tech University. His parents were living paycheck to paycheck as their family grew to four children.        
	But once his father completed his doctorate, prejudice and discrimination blocked job opportunities, Khan said.        
	The family moved back to Pakistan for a year, then to New York, where Khans father took a job as an assistant manager in a gas station and later as the manager of a discount store. I just didnt know about it, he said. I feel stupid ignoring it my whole life.        
	Theres kind of an image of immigrant kids born and raised in America as being kind of ashamed of their parents, said Foner. But these students are proud of their parents and their parents experiences. In some ways, the proudest students are those who had the most difficult time.        
	On a recent Thursday, 20 of her students presented their oral histories.        
	Panama-born Angela Wu Cen, 19, who was 12 when the family came to the US, was surprised to learn that her parents marriage had not been the fruit of a long romance but had come about in a matter of weeks.        
	The couple had been introduced by a mutual acquaintance of their families. They lived in separate towns, saw each other a few times and decided to marry, Wu said. So they really didnt know each other, she added, sounding amused. How can they get married?        
	Danilo Rojas, 19, was struck by his fathers drive to make a better life: fleeing poverty in Honduras, sneaking across the Mexican border into the US and working as a dishwasher in a restaurant, a building superintendent and a construction worker.         
	My dad, he didnt spend any money on himself, Rojas said. He never thought about himself. He thought about making things better for his family. I think most young people today dont think about more than themselves. Its hard to be that selfless, especially in todays world.        
	The interview with his father changed the way Rojas looks at the vast underclass of immigrants on the margins of society, like street vendors and busboys and labourers. I wonder about how hard theyre working and how hard theyre trying to make it, he said.                    WRITTEN WITH A NEW YORK TIMES REPORT

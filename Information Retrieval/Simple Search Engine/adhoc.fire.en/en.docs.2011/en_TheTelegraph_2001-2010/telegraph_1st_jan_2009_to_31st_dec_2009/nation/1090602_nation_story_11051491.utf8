	Jaipur, June 1: An unseasonal thunderstorm has killed at least 50 black bucks in a wildlife sanctuary near the Thar desert, with forest officials claiming the easily frightened animals died of shock at the thunder and lightning.        
	The Tal Chappar Sanctuary in Chiru district, 210km northwest of Jaipur, is home to at least 2,000 of the most elegant black bucks, an endangered species that actor Salman Khan was jailed for hunting.        
	Unofficial reports said some 100 animals may have died, and even officials conceded the toll could be higher than 50 since the storm, which began on May 29 night, was still continuing in the region.        
	Last weeks Cyclone Aila in Bengal had washed away 300 deer in the Sunderbans, but the post-mortem reports of the Tal Chappar black bucks suggest these animals did not drown in the flash floods caused by the heavy rain.        
	The animals, fabled for their shy and timid nature, apparently died of heart failure, frightened by the sudden thunder and lightning, rare in the arid region. The dead range from seven-year-old adults to six-month-old fawns.        
	Some wildlife experts said it was hard to believe that all the black bucks had died of heart failure, but forest officials denied any possibility of drowning deaths caused by blocked drainage and heavy flooding.        
	There cannot be over-flooding of the forest because when the water level reaches two feet, it drains off. Whatever rainwater is left, collects in small, seasonal ponds, district forest officer K.C. Sharma said.        
	Local villagers alleged the forest authorities were late in starting rescue operations.         
	Rescue operations are on. Three veterinarians are trying to revive animals that may not have died, Sharma said.        
	Officials said it was difficult to tranquillise black bucks for treatment because they get frightened so easily.        
	The sanctuary, dotted by shallow, low-lying areas, has a swathe of open grassland with scattered acacia and the spiny prosopis shrubs. To its west, separated by a watershed area, lie a cluster of hillocks and exposed slate and quartzite rocks.        
	In the past, the sanctuary  which falls under the countrys principal arid zone and receives erratic rainfall  used to get flooded whenever there was heavy rain. However, with salt mining going on in the watershed, hardly any rainwater falling on the hillocks now reaches the sanctuary.        
	The off-season rain has been a blessing in one way, Sharma said. It has helped replenish the forests mothiya (pearl-shaped) grass, the black bucks staple diet.        
	Tal Chappar is also home to migratory birds like demoiselle cranes, harriers and short-toed eagles. The sanctuary is not as well known as Ranthambhore or Sariska, but is being developed for wildlife tourism under a Rs 2.82-crore, five-year plan.

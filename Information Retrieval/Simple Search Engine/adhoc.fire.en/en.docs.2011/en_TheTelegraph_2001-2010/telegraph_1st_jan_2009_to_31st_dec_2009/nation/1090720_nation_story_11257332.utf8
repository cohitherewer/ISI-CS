	Bhubaneswar, July 19: The last rites of sub-inspector Ajit Bardhan, who was abducted and killed by Maoists in Jharbeda in Sundargarh district, were performed with state honours today.         
	A guard of honour was given to his mortal remains at his native village of Gadakana on the citys outskirts, in presence of senior police officers such as director-general M.M. Praharaj and police commissioner B.K. Sharma.        
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik visited the slain officers home to pay tributes.         
	He spoke to Bardhans father, Jayakrishna, and widow Rosaline. I am extremely distressed by the young officers death and stand by you in this moment of grief, said the chief minister.         
	I understand that the death was a result of Maoist action. Police are combing the area and when caught the rebels will be dealt with severely, he said.         
	The chief minister also announced ex gratia for the bereaved family and promised free treatment for the ailing father.         
	Later in the afternoon, Bardhans last rites were performed at Swargadwar in Puri with full state honours.         
	Yesterday, his body was retrieved from Jharbeda amid a fierce gun battle. The body reached Bhubaneswar today after an autopsy at K-Balang.

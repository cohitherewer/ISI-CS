The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Big names of Mumbai polls
                                                                                                               Big names of Mumbai polls
          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                              
	Mumbai, Oct. 12: The countrys financial capital is showing off its muscles even in the elections.        
	A survey conducted by Maharashtra Election Watch, an independent body monitoring the election process, shows that a total of 122 crorepatis will contest tomorrows Assembly polls from Mumbai and Thane, with declared assets worth Rs 849 crore.         
	The survey showed that Samajwadi Partys state unit chief, Abu Asim Azmi, is the richest candidate in the fray with assets pegged at Rs 126 crore.        
	Azmi had lost the Lok Sabha elections from Mumbai North West, but is contesting from two Muslim-dominated seats, Bhiwandi and Mankhurd, and is tipped to win.         
	Not far from Mankhurd is Vikroli, where cricket icon Sachin Tendulkars schoolmate  and Indias only back-to-back Test double centurion  Vinod Kambli is trying to open his account in politics.         
	Kambli, now 37, played his cricket in the gullies of Vikroli, before moving to Shardashram School where he teamed up with Tendulkar.         
	The left-handed batsman is contesting on a ticket from the new Lok Bharti party and will battle Shiv Senas former mayor Datta Dalvi and NCPs Pallavi Patil. Kambli, who made a record nine comebacks to national cricket before calling it a day, has a thin chance of winning though with the NCP, Shiv Sena and Raj Thackerays MNS battling for the turf.        
	Mumbai region could play a crucial role in the formation of the next government with a chunk of 60 seats  10 in the city, 26 in the suburbs and 24 in Thane. The Congress hopes the elections will follow the Lok Sabha trend, when it made a clean sweep of all the seats in Mumbai.        
	If Kambli has an uphill task ahead, so does Dagdi Chawl don Arun Gawli, who is contesting from Byculla. Gawli, the sitting MLA from Chinchpokli, is cooling his heels at Taloja prison after he was arrested on charges of eliminating a Sena councillor and demanding protection money from a builder.         
	Incidentally, Gawli tops the list of MLAs who fully utilised their MLA Local Area Development funds.         
	If dons are contesting, so are lawyers. A total of 20 lawyers are in the fray with advocate Deenanath Tiwari, who has worked as the in-house lawyer for the BJP-Sena combine, is taking on Mumbai Congress chief Kripa Shankar Singh from Kalina on the western suburbs.         
	Also in the fray is Rizwan Merchant, one of Mumbais biggest legal eagles. Contesting as a Samajwadi Party nominee from Bandra West, Merchant, who helped Bollywood star Sanjay Dutt get married to Manyata, is battling the actors close friend Baba Siddique, the Congress sitting legislator.         
	During campaigning, Sanjay had to campaign for Merchant, while sister Priya did the rounds for Siddique.         
	Slain BJP leader Pramod Mahajans daughter Poonam Rao is facing a tough test in Ghatkopar West, a traditional BJP bastion from where her father won the only Lok Sabha election he fought.         
	Poonam is facing opposition from supporters of BJP leader Pravin Chheda, who was not given a ticket.         
	The toughest battle is expected in Mahim, which includes strong Sena and MNS pockets in Dadar and Shivaji Park, where popular Marathi TV star Aadesh Bandekar is battling Sena rebel and Congress candidate Sada Sarvankar.

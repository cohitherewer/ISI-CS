The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong cold to fourth front
                                                                                                               Cong cold to fourth front
          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	New Delhi, May 16: The Congress is extremely reluctant to accommodate the fourth front parties in the new government.        
	Party leaders said though a formal decision would be taken at the Congress Working Committee meeting scheduled for tomorrow, indications were that Lalu Prasad, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Amar Singh may not find a place in the council of ministers.        
	The UPA is still 14 short of a simple majority but, with the BJP conceding defeat, the Congress-led alliance does not expect a threat if a confidence motion is moved. In the event of any uncertainty, the UPA feels it can bank on others, who total 19, to bail out the government.        
	The main reason for the reluctance to bring Mulayams Samajwadi Party, which won a respectable 24 seats in Uttar Pradesh, on board is its strength in the state. The Congress, led by Rahul Gandhi, has placed the state on top of its agenda. Mulayam and his flock are now seen more as a threat than a potential ally.        
	A majority of the CWC members feel that in principle, the party should stick to those who had sided with the Congress during the polls.         
	Many in the Congress appear to be more wary of the Samajwadis than Lalu Prasads RJD.         
	Congress leaders like Ahmed Patel, Digvijay Singh and others were upset by Amar Singhs tendency to go public with his grouse during the sensitive seat-sharing talks, which eventually failed.        
	On Lalu Prasad, Congress leaders said he could now rue at leisure his decision to offer the Congress crumbs  four seats  in a seat-sharing formula he sewed up with Paswan for Bihars 40 seats.        
	Personality clashes apart, the dominant opinion in the Congress is that the new UPA regime should be a well-knit team that shares a common goal and vision.        
	Amars temperament and style of functioning are seen to be out of sync in this scheme of things.

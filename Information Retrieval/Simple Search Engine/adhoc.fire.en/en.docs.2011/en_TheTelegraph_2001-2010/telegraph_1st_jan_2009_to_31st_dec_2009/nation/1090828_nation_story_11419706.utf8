The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Class X test on school shift
                                                                                                               Class X test on school shift
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 27: Students who change their school after Class X may need to take a computerised examination instead of the current pen-and-paper test under plans to make the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) public examination optional.        
	The examination will not be conducted online (like those based on the Internet), and will be required only for those students who shift schools  out of choice or compulsion - after Class X under a proposal the CBSE is considering.         
	The blueprint for making the examination optional has not yet been finalised and is still under discussion with stakeholders students, parents and schools  CBSE chairman Vineet Joshi clarified today, speaking to The Telegraph from Indore.         
	Human resource development minister Kapil Sibal has listed as one of his priorities the plan to make the Class X board examination in CBSE schools optional.        
	The proposal for a computerised examination involves ensuring that all schools give preference to their own students during admissions to Class XI, ministry sources said. But the proposal, they clarified, need not be accepted.        
	The CBSE, under this plan, will evolve a common framework for continuous and comprehensive evaluation that all its schools will need to follow in Class X.         
	Students will be graded, using the common framework, through the year in each subject based on their performance in class tests, quizzes and in classroom discussions and debates.         
	Towards the end of Class X, students will have to inform their school of the stream  science, humanities or commerce  that they wish to pursue in Class XI.         
	At the end Class X, their school will inform the students whether they will be admitted in Class XI in the stream of their choice, based on their grades.        
	A school can determine its own minimum requirements in grades for admitting students in a particular stream.         
	Those students who get the stream of their choice, and wish to continue in that school, need not take any qualifying exam at the end of Class X.         
	Students who wish to change their school  either out of choice or because they are not getting admission in their current school in the stream of their choice  can appear for the computerised test under this proposal.         
	Those who have to shift because their parents are transferred can also, for instance, take this computerised test, a ministry official said. Based on their performance in this test, these students can seek admission in other schools.         
	Each school, after setting its own standards for admission in Class XI, can open remaining seats for these students.         
	The computerised test will be held over a span of time  like the Graduate Records Examination (GRE)  which students can take on a date of their choice.         
	The CBSE already has a vast question bank in every subject, sources said, and this bank will be used to randomly alter questions on different days of the test.

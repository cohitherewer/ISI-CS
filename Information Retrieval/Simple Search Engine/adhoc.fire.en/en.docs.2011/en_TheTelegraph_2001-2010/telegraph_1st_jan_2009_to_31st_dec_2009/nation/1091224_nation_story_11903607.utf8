          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 23: P. Chidambaram today asked for senior bureaucrats and police officers to be tested at 50 years of age to measure if they shape up. Or else, they can ship out.        
	Wanting to green an administration that he finds too grey, Chidambaram said such a performance appraisal of the officers of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) and Indian Police Service (IPS) would pave the way for the infusion of youth.        
	The home ministers suggestion may be a shocker for civil servants, many of whom join the profession because of the security of employment and the perks.        
	The retirement age for IAS and IPS officers is 58. Only the cabinet secretary and the secretaries of defence and home ministries retire at 60 after a fixed tenure of two years at the top.        
	Give them pension and let better performers move forward, Chidambaram told an audience comprising mostly of senior police officers.         
	There was little applause after his radical suggestion.         
	Chidambaram said such a measure would have to be taken cautiously after factoring in the response of the civil services. If the services cooperate, this is a very strong case for review, he said.

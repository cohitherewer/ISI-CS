The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pat from Sena, tacit support of party
                                                                                                               Pat from Sena, tacit support of party
          SANJAY K. JHA                           Thackeray: Hindu support                                  
	New Delhi, March 18: The BJP leadership today took care to dissociate itself from the communal remarks attributed to Varun Gandhi but the popular sentiment in the party mirrored ally Shiv Senas public acclaim: Ye Gandhi chalega!        
	Top RSS leaders contacted Varun and asked him not to worry as the Sangh parivar sat up and took note of his potential, sources said.        
	Varun, initially jittery after an FIR was filed against him yesterday for the hate speech, then decided to assert his Hindu identity.         
	He spoke of cow slaughter, arms smuggling, vandalisation of temples and rape of Hindu girls in his constituency. Varun said Pilibhit, where he is set to make his election debut from, is a sensitive border area where Hindus were living in panic and he had to restore their confidence.         
	I am proud of my faith and not apologetic about it, Varun said in a statement from his Delhi home, adds PTI. I stand by what I have said and what I have not said, I will strongly refute        
	But while claiming the tapes of his comments were doctored, Varun did not reveal what he did say in his campaign speech. On the tapes, he is heard threatening to behead Muslims.        
	BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad today said: The BJP disassociates and disapproves the contents of the speech and the comments attributed to Varun Gandhi.         
	Asked if the party would take action against him, Prasad said: The matter is before the Election Commission and we will wait for its view.        
	However, in private, BJP leaders tried to justify his remarks and said there was no question of punitive action or even a public censure. Varun would be in trouble only if the Election Commission bars him from contesting, sources said.        
	The partys official caution was guided by fears of angering allies and the commissions intervention.         
	One ally couldnt have been happier though. Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray said in an editorial in party mouthpiece Saamna: There is nothing wrong in what he has said. He is one Gandhi we like.        
	But by taking this posture, Varun has limited his political options. He now has to make a career in the BJP alone and the hardliners would expect him to stretch this line in future.         
	Varun had impressed top BJP leaders with his talent but failed to rise as quickly as he wanted. He wanted to become general secretary long ago, but was asked to work his way up. Sources said Varun didnt take this well and antagonised many leaders with his arrogance and ambition.         
	But now, by accident or otherwise, Varun has positioned himself on the shortcut to fame  the same route that gave Narendra Modi such phenomenal success in a short time. He has delighted the Sangh by arguing that anyone who talks of Hindu interest is branded communal in this country.         
	This is a typical Sangh parivar lament, now being hawked by Indira Gandhis grandson.         
	Many BJP leaders recalled what Varun had said  I am a proud Gandhi, an Indian and a Hindu in equal measure and I am not apologetic about being a Hindu. When asked about his alleged anti-Muslim comments, they shrugged those off as doctored.        
	Shahnawaz Hussain and Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, the BJPs Muslim faces who had yesterday exploded against Varun and demanded an apology, were asked to shut up today.

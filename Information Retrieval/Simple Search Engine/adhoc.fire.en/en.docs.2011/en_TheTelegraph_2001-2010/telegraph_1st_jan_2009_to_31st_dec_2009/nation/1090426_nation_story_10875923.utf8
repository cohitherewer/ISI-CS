          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Cargo crown                                  
	Bhubaneswar, April 25: The global economic slowdown seems to have had little impact on activities at Paradip, the only major public sector port in the state.        
	Paradip port has handled an all-time record traffic of 46.41 million tonnes in 2008-09 and secured third place among all major ports in traffic growth. The port has broken its earlier record of 42.44 million tonnes during the previous fiscal, Paradip Port Trust chairman K. Raghuramaiah said.        
	The port has come third among all major ports by registering a traffic growth of 9.36 per cent over the previous year, he said. Revealing that the ports cargo traffic doubled in the past six years, as compared to what it handled during 2002-03, he said the port had handled 46.41 million tonnes of cargo as against 23.9 million tonnes in 2002-03.        
	An all-time record of 34.35 million tonnes of rail-borne traffic was handled by the port railway during the year, surpassing the previous record of 30.80 million tonnes handled during 2007-08, he added.        
	Highlighting the ports achievements in handling new cargo, Raghuramaiah said 0.140 million tonnes of raw sugar were handled and 1.575 million tonnes of crude oil were imported for the first time during 2008-09.        
	Claiming a substantial improvement in the fiscal performance of the port last year, he said the port had earned an operating income of Rs 700.21 crore in 2008-09 against previous years Rs 639.98 crore.        
	Unfolding the ports expansion plans, he said that the work of deepening the channel was being undertaken at a cost of Rs 253.36 crore and the contract had been awarded to the Dredging Corporation of India. The project was likely to be completed by March 2010, he said.        
	Construction of an iron ore berth and a coal berth with back-up facilities would be started on a built, operate and transfer basis through a public-private partnership model, he said, adding that there was a proposal to build one oil berth and two multi-purpose berths.

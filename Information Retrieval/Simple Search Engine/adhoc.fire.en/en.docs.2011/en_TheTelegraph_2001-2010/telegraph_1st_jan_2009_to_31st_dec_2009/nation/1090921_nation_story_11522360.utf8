The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Businessman held for blackmailing Anoushka
                                                                                                               Businessman held for blackmailing Anoushka
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Anoushka                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 20: Delhi police arrested a Mumbai businessman on Tuesday for allegedly blackmailing sitar player Anoushka Shankar, the daughter of Pandit Ravi Shankar.        
	Junaid, 29, allegedly accessed Anoushkas personal photographs and demanded money in exchange for not making the pictures public, the police said today.         
	A source in the Delhi police special cell, which arrested Junaid, said the businessman had claimed during initial interrogation that he knew Anoushka and was upset over a deterioration in their friendship.        
	Junaid was produced before a Delhi court on Wednesday and sent to 14 days police custody to facilitate his interrogation. The police are not ruling out further arrests.         
	Junaid has been charged under Section 386 of the Indian Penal Code for threatening in a bid to extort money.         
	Ravi Shankar had written to both Delhi police and the home ministry last month from the US, where he is based, to complain about his 28-year-old daughters harassment.         
	The father and daughter informed the police that they suspected the photographs may have been copied from Anoushkas laptop earlier this year from a servicing centre.        
	The police, an official said, had questioned employees of the service centre named by Anoushka, but were not convinced of their involvement in the harassment of the sitar player.         
	The police then examined whether the photographs could have been accessed from a source other than Anoushkas laptop.         
	We found that the photographs in question were also in Anoushkas email. We suspect the blackmailer may have hacked into her email account to obtain the photographs, the official said.        
	Junaid allegedly sent Anoushka six emails in all, demanding in excess of $100,000 in return for not publicising the photographs.        
	The police may slap charges under the Information Technology Act if they are convinced he hacked into Anoushkas email.        
	Sources said the hacker sent out one of the personal pictures to those on the address book in Anoushkas email account.         
	Within a couple of days, Anoushka sent out an email to everyone on the mailing list requesting them to ignore the earlier mail since the account had been hacked.        
	Along with her half-sister Norah Jones, Anoushka was nominated for the Grammy Awards in 2003. She was scheduled to perform in Mumbai with legendary rock band Jethro Tull on November 29 last year but the concert had to be cancelled because of the terror attacks in the city.        
	Jethro Tull and Anoushka reorganised the event  titled the Billion Hearts Concert  on December 5 in memory of the victims of the attacks.

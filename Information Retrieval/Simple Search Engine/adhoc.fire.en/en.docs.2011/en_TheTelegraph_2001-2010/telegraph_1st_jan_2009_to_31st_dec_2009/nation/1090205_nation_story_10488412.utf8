          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AND PTI                              
	Patna, Feb. 4: Patna High Court has sentenced a 75-year-old doctor to three months in jail for taking a bribe of Rs 25 nearly 24 years ago.        
	In 1985, the CBI caught Balgovind Prasad red-handed while he was taking the money from a sweeper for issuing a fake medical certificate.        
	Prasad was then posted as a doctor for Eastern Railway at Mahendru Ghat here.         
	The CBI bribery case against him dragged on for seven years and Prasad was pronounced guilty on November 23, 1992. He was handed a one-year jail term and a fine of Rs 1,000, but immediately granted bail.         
	The doctor moved the high court the same year.        
	Yesterday, Justice K.K. Mandal upheld the conviction, 16 years after his appeal was filed. He commuted the prison term to three months but raised the fine to Rs 2,000.         
	The case was too old and had been dragging inordinately, the court said.         
	Mandal directed Balgovind to surrender before a trial court within six weeks.         
	The case was dragging and the bribe money was too small, so Prasad thought he would get a reprieve from the court, prosecution lawyer Vipin Kumar Sinha told reporters after the verdict. But all the charges have been proved against him.         
	Police are all set to arrest the 75-year-old and put him behind bars if he fails to surrender on time.

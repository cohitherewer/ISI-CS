          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      RJD workers celebrate in Patna on Thursday after the party rsquo;s success in the Bihar Assembly bypolls. (PTI)                          
	New Delhi, Sept. 17: The BJP has taken one positive from the NDAs by-election setback in Bihar: it believes Nitish Kumar would now be more dependent on it and would not even think of ending the alliance.        
	In public, the BJP said the bypoll results were not satisfactory. In private, sources from the Bihar unit hoped Nitish would now recognise and better appreciate the allys importance in future elections and not dismiss it as a junior partner to be tossed around at will.        
	Spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad said: The result is not satisfactory but the understanding between us and the Janata Dal (United) remains perfect because the basic glue  namely, the common fight against Lalu Prasad, going back to the fodder scam of the 90s  exists.        
	The sources said Nitish was now likely to realise that the Lalu threat still loomed large even after the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and its partner, the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), were down to four seats in the Lok Sabha polls held four months ago.        
	Nitish was on a high then. Together we won 32 of the 40 seats. There was speculation he might leave us before the Assembly polls to reiterate his secular credentials. We are sure that nothing of that sort will happen now, a BJP source said.        
	Party officials cited their better strike rate  the BJP won two of the four seats it contested while the JD(U) won four out of 12  and argued it would not pay Nitish to go it alone.        
	If he had thought of the Congress as an alternative, the bypolls have proved we are a more formidable force than them, a source said.        
	The BJP now plans to drive a better bargain than it expected from Nitish in the Assembly polls.        
	A source dismissed the theory that Muslim antipathy for the BJP would be a negative for the NDA in Bihar, citing the example of the Begusarai Assembly seat. There, the sitting JD(U) MP, a Muslim, campaigned for the BJP candidate. The BJP won.        
	The BJP said it expected Nitish to rectify his flaws and contain the rebellion threat from within his own party before the big battle next year.

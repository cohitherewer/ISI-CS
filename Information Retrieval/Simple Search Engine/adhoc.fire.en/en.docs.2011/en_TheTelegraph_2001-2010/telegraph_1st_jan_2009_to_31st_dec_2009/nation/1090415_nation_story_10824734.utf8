The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Debonair darling
                                                                                                               Debonair darling
  - Almost everybody loves Naveen but dont look beyond the hoardings        SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY IN BHUBANESWAR                        Naveen Patnaik: Not conventional				                                       
	To the urban voter, Naveen Patnaiks the cool guy equally at ease supping with the Jackie Kennedys of American high society and chewing up opponents in the rough and tumble of Orissa politics.        
	To the not-so-literate villager, even the chief ministers inability to speak Oriya  coupled with his ability to speak chaste English  is a feather in his cap.        
	For the moment, it seems, Naveenbabu can do no wrong. Little is known about his private life, but his USP is his unlikeness with conventional politicians.        
	Naveen has held only two formal news conferences in a decade  the first soon after becoming chief minister in 2000 and the second after dumping the BJP last month.        
	The gates of Naveen Niwas, his Lutyens-style bungalow with sprawling lawns, close early: the chief minister is known to like his nightcaps with like-minded people. No Mayavati-style, aggressive security surrounds him  a police Gypsy under the leafy portico is the only give-away.        
	His speeches in Oriya are strung together in the Roman script. Naveenbabu just about stumbles through it, evoking much mirth all around but safe in the knowledge that it all adds to his mystique. Most Oriyas speak of him with a fondness similar to a fathers pride in a son whos made it big.        
	All this is enough to make his political opponents hate his guts, and even some in the Biju Janata Dal are ready to brand him an upstart.        
	Naveen is vindictive and unpredictable, said Sujit Padhi, the Congress MP from Kandhamal. In his 11-year career, hes stood by none and only cared about himself.        
	Biju Patnaiks son had quarrelled with his fathers loyalists and split the Janata Dal, dumped ally JMM, formed a government with BJP support and then broken away, and in between thrown out friends-turned-foes Dilip Ray and Bijoy Mohapatra.        
	The middle classes, however, see both style and substance in their chief minister, and swear by his commitment to development and governance.        
	No one asks for bribes now; and peoples purchasing power has gone up. Five years ago, no one would come to my pathology lab but now business is booming, said a doctor who didnt wish to be named.        
	Infrastructure has improved faster than ever. The roads are good; schools and government offices are being built in the interiors; and the face of the state capital has changed.        
	Huge hoardings of Abhishek Bachchan and Deepika Padukone cut through Bhubaneswars skyline, selling cellphone connections. Beer bars and parlours have mushroomed. Scores of technical and professional institutes have sprung up and educated youth no longer have to look for greener pastures elsewhere.        
	Orissa is suddenly a happening place and no one wants the pace to slacken.                  
	Yet the picture is different in the impoverished south and west. Some 48 per cent of the states people live below the poverty line and 17 of the 30 districts are Maoist-hit. But small signs of change are visible even there.        
	In troubled Kandhamal, newly built yellow cement tablets speak of work done under the rural job guarantee scheme. Conceived by the Centre, its success is being credited to the chief minister.        
	Roads snaking through remote tribal areas advertise the Prime Ministers Gram Sadak Yojana. It was Atal Bihari Vajpayees brainchild but again, Naveen is seen as the man who made it happen on the ground.        
	Small-time electrician Prahlad said that for the first time, he now had work through the year, setting up cellphone towers in remote Koraput and Malkangiri. Although the payment, routed through contractors, is not too good, he is proud to work with the mobile phone service providers.        
	Corruption doesnt blight peoples daily lives unlike Congress chief minister J.B. Patnaiks days when ministers would openly demand money for routine transfers and appointments, people say. Some, though, whisper about kickoffs to the BJD from the Posco and Vedanta industrial deals.        
	But the bigger blot is the land war that has stalled industrialisation projects. Both Posco, which made the biggest foreign investment ever in India to build a steel plant near Paradip, and Vedanta, which is planning an aluminium refinery in Kalahandi, have seen their projects held up by land acquisition problems.        
	Perhaps the worst blow came in 2006, when police firing on tribals protesting a Tata steel factory in Jajpur killed 12 and injured scores.        
	Critics also carp that Naveen is too hands-off an administrator: all power has been delegated to a coterie of babus and the chief minister, who just takes the key policy decisions, is virtually inaccessible.        
	For all Naveens popularity, though, the BJDs own estimation is cautious: it expects 80 of the Assemblys 147 seats, up by 19 from last time but lower by 13 than the combined BJD-BJP tally.        
	Padhi is dismissive of BJD projections of victory. Yet he puts the Congresss expected tally just at 60, 14 short of majority though 22 more than last time.        
	The BJP, after a lot of noise about avenging Naveens betrayal, has made a mess of ticket distribution and could be this elections biggest loser.         
	There are too many leaders and no one listens to anyone, said Basudev Tripathy, who resigned as the BJP legal cell chief on April 12.        
	If Naveen falls short, he can always turn to the Congress for support and do a quid pro quo at the Centre for the UPA. BJD insiders claim theres an unspoken agreement between Naveen and the wife of a man (Rajiv Gandhi) he knew well.        
	If he scores a hat-trick, Naveen, a one-time reluctant politician much like Sonia, will have proved himself an able successor to his father.  
	Assembly and Lok Sabha polls on April 16 and 23

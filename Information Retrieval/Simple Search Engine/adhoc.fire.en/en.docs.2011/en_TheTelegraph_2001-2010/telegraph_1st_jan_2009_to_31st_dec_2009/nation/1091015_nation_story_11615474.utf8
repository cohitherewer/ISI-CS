The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CBI probe on Nitish sought
                                                                                                               CBI probe on Nitish sought
                            
	Patna, Oct. 14 (PTI): A criminal writ petition was filed today in Patna High Court seeking a CBI probe against Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, accusing him of trying to tamper with evidence in the murder of a Congressman in 1991.        
	The petitioners, Shail Devi and Radheshya Singh, the mother and the brother of Congress activist Sitaram Singh, who was murdered in front of a polling booth at Pandarak in Patna on November 17, 1991, alleged that Nitish was trying to influence witnesses and tamper with the evidence.        
	Their counsel Vinu Kumar said his clients sought an inquiry by the agency as fair trial wont be possible in Bihar. The petition is yet to be admitted, he said.        
	A Barh court had acquitted Nitish in the case a long time ago on the grounds that there was no evidence against him.        
	On August 31, 2009, however, teh court summoned Nitish on September 10 after taking cognisance of a complaint, filed by Ramanand Singh, who had deposed as a key witness. Nitish had challenged the summon and the court stayed all proceedings in Barh court till it disposed his petition.

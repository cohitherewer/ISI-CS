The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Gym amp; homes for Mumbai cops 
                                                                                                               Gym amp; homes for Mumbai cops

	Mumbai, Sept. 6: Mumbais overworked, 26/11-scarred police can expect better housing and food, gymnasiums, and schools for their children under a plan to lift morale that may make their counterparts in Calcutta envious.        
	The Mumbai police brass have set another example by establishing a line of communication with the constabulary through a newsletter, Samvaad.        
	Stress and squalid living conditions, as well as poor pay and long hours, have often been cited as factors partly explaining the inefficiency and high-handedness that Indias police are regularly accused of.        
	The man behind the plan is Mumbais new police chief, D. Sivanandhan, who took charge about 80 days ago after predecessor Hasan Gafoor was criticised by a 26/11 probe panel for allegedly displaying poor leadership skills.        
	Since the November 26 attack, which killed 14 poorly equipped policemen, morale has been low in the citys 45,000-strong police force.        
	So, while the state government gears up to buy better weapons and set up a new anti-terror force, the police commissioner is working on internal changes.        
	He recently performed the bhoomi pujan for a school that will reserve half its 6,420 seats for personnels children, charging subsidised fees. The six-storey school, which will have a playground, will come up near the Worli police headquarters in central Mumbai.        
	It will be run by the Goenka and Associates Educational Trust, which built a similar police school in Thane when Sivanandhan was Thane police commissioner a few years ago.        
	A gymnasium is being built for the constabulary on the Naigaum police grounds, Parel. Complete with a cardio section with three treadmill machines, it is expected to match any private gym. A smaller gymnasium has already come up at LT Marg police station near the polices Crawford Market headquarters. Eventually, I want all 89 police stations to have their own gymnasiums, said Sivanandhan, who wakes up at 4.45am for his morning workout.        
	The police have tied up with the Health for You Foundation, run by nutritionist Naini Setalvad, to overhaul police kitchens and replace high-calorie, oily snacks like vada pav with corn, sprouts, poha, upma and fruits.        
	Homes will be built for the 20,000-odd personnel who do not have quarters. The state has increased the floor space index for police housing from 2.5 to 4, allowing higher buildings to be built.

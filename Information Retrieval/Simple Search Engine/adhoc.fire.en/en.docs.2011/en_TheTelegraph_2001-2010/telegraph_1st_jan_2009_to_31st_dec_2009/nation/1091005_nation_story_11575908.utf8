The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Love on campus: Paks social suicide bomb
                                                                                                               Love on campus: Paks social suicide bomb
          NASIR JAFFRY                          Campus debate                                  
	Islamabad, Oct. 4: A raging debate posing a Hamletian question is sweeping through Pakistans conservative campuses: to love or not to love.        
	The debate was sparked by a student of the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), who shot off an email raising questions about public display of affection, in short PDA. The unnamed student sent out the mail, titled To love or not to love, saying she was fed up with on-campus indecency.         
	The mass email, described as a social suicide bomb by Asif Akhtar, one of the recipients, has divided the campus between conservative, retro-revisionists, ultra-modern, party-hopping and next-generation liberals.         
	The mail, which hit the inboxes of LUMS students, pointed at freshmen and some seniors who have to seek physical consolation from the members of opposite sex many times in a day on campus and in public sight.        
	To back her claims, the student provided specific examples and collected photographic evidence.        
	Akhtar quoted the students email in his blog published in the Dawn newspaper. Standing at the main entrance, a girl stands on tip of her toes and kisses a boy goodbye; lying in the lawn in front of the library, a boy rolls over the girl lying down beside him and remains in this posture; sitting in the academic block, a boy constantly rubs a girls leg.....        
	The student points out that because of such behaviour, aunties spread rumours that doubt the chastity of girls studying in LUMS.        
	Advocating a religious, cultured and social environment on the campus, the student asked the university administration to frame rules outlining an inter-gender code of conduct.        
	The email has triggered sharp responses on campus. One male student responded with a I have sinned mail.        
	I shave twice a week and my painchas (trousers) hang obstinately below my heels. I have a penchant for ties that resemble the Christian cross and my satanic dress code is causing me to stray far, far away from the straight path. During the holy month (of Ramzan), instead of attending Quranic recitals in the mosque, I was listening to the demonic sounds of Pink Floyd, the male student wrote in his email.        
	He blamed deviant professors for this transition, whose theories made his moral-compass go awry.        
	Social observers in Pakistan said the debate was imminent since the society is struggling to preserve its largely Islamic identity in the wake of challenges from those promoting western liberalism.        
	Public display of affection in educational institutions is, however, frowned upon in most western countries as well. In India, PDA is discouraged but takes place beyond the prying eyes of the moral police.        
	On campuses of the elite IIT Kharagpur or IIM Calcutta, PDA is uncommon, but for different reasons.        
	There are about 15 girls as compared to 200-odd boys. Of them half were in relationships already. Of the rest, half were not interested. That leaves about three girls. Where is the scope for PDA? said a former student of IIM Calcutta.        
	With inputs from Chandreyee Chatterjee

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 31: The Supreme Court today questioned the logic of awarding deemed university status by the dozen. Earlier such status was granted to any institution if it attained excellence in academic standards, a two-judge bench said.        
	Under a 1956 law, the status was granted to institutions at least 25 years old and known for research and academic standards. In recent years, deemed varsities have mushroomed with much younger institutions receiving the status. The court was hearing a PIL alleging the status was being awarded indiscriminately without following any norms.        
	The Centre told the court that it had formed a panel, headed by P.N. Tandon, on July 6, 2009, to review the functioning of all deemed universities and hand in a report by the first week of September. It said education minister Kapil Sibal was reviewing the process of approval and functioning of deemed universities. All pending proposals have been kept in abeyance, the government counsel said.         
	Why should we need deemed universities? Do you think we should abolish that status? the court asked. The Centre said the Tandon panel would consider this too.

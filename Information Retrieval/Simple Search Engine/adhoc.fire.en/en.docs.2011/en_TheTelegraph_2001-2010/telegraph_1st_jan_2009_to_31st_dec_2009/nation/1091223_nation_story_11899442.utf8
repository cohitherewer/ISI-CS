  - Court asks drink-drive youth to write 50 times he wont tipple again          ANANYA SENGUPTA                                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 22: Some simple lessons  like dont mix drink and drive  are best learnt by rote.        
	Caught driving drunk last month, Rakesh (name changed) was asked to write I will not drink again 50 times as punishment by a Delhi magistrate yesterday.         
	The 21-year-old was returning home after a party on November 21 when he was stopped by traffic police and asked to take a breathalyser test.         
	The test showed the alcohol level in his blood was higher than the permissible limit and he was handed a ticket.        
	Yesterday, when the second-year BCom student of Delhi University arrived in the court of Dwarka district magistrate Sumed Kumar Sethi, he might have thought he was back in school.        
	Do you know driving under the influence of alcohol is a crime? Do you know you can be jailed for drinking before you are 25? the judge scolded Rakesh who listened, head hung, before ordering a few blank sheets of paper to be handed to the young man.        
	As Rakesh, who was expecting a hefty fine and his licence to be revoked, looked up in surprise, the judge told him: Write 50 times that I wont drink again. If you do so again and are brought back here, you will be punished severely.        
	Rakesh did and walked out a free man.        
	This isnt the first time that a person caught driving under the influence of alcohol has been handed out an unconventional punishment.         
	Last year, Delhi High Court ordered a young businessman who injured two ice-cream vendors while driving drunk to work for an NGO for six months.        
	In August 2007, a court ordered 15 young men, arrested for allegedly harassing motorists by performing dangerous stunts, to do community service in gurdwaras.

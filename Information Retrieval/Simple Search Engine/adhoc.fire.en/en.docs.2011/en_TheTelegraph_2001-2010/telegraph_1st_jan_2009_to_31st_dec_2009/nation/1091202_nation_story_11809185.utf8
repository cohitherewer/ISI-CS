          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 1: The Naveen Patnaik government today drew flak from the Opposition in the Assembly for alleged irregularities and failures in implementation of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS).        
	Dubbing the MGNREGS the states biggest rural job scam, Opposition whip Prasad Harichandan said the government had been indicted by various agencies, including the Delhi-based Centre for Environment and Food Security (CEFS), Hyderabad-based National Institute of Rural Development (NIRD) and the Comptroller and Auditor General for various irregularities and corruption.        
	While the CEFS, which conducted social audit in 100 villages of six districts, had observed that 67 per cent of funds released under MGNREGS had been siphoned off, NIRD found 31 per cent ghost workers and wages paid only to 42 per cent workers, said Harichandan. Similarly, CAG had found various irregularities to the tune of Rs 500 crore, he said.        
	Panchayati raj minister Prafulla Samal said the government had successfully and effectively implemented the MGNREGS. The government had been able to create 18.49 crore mandays by spending Rs 2,714.32 crore out of Rs 3,006.20 crore available under the scheme. The government had provided wage employment to at least 44.06 lakh families out of 53.23 lakh families, who were issued job cards, he said.        
	Admitting delay and irregularities in wage payment, he said the state government had recently signed an MoU with the State Bank of India for making payment through business correspondents posted in each gram panchayat.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tent debut for cabinet meeting
                                                                                                               Tent debut for cabinet meeting
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar outside the tent in Barbighi village on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	Patna, Feb. 10: The tent accommodating chief minister Nitish Kumar, his cabinet colleagues and top bureaucrats is surrounded by green wheat and yellow mustard fields from all the sides at nondescript Barbighi village in north Bihars Begusarai district.        
	Nitish initiated the novel experiment of holding a cabinet meeting today in this tent drawing accolades from the rural poor who had never seen a chief minister with his full-fledged office staying with them.         
	Nitish spent last night in the tent amid the villagers, believed to be mesmerised by the way the chief minister had brought himself and his government at peoples doorsteps.        
	The Opposition, however, described Nitishs historical move as a gimmick ahead of the polls. The Opposition leaders were critical about the manner in which luxury buses transported all the ministers and departmental secretaries from Patna to the remote village today despite the secretariat having a well-organised office to hold the meeting.        
	Holding cabinet meeting in a village makes no difference; rather it has put an additional burden on the state exchequer, said former chief minister Jagannath Mishra. Senior RJD leader Jagdanand Singh, too, described the cabinet meeting in the village as exercise in futility.        
	Unperturbed, and also enthused by the huge response, Nitish said: Its just the beginning of imposing lokshakti (peoples power) over rajshakti (state power). People should have power to directly scrutinise what the government elected by them is doing.

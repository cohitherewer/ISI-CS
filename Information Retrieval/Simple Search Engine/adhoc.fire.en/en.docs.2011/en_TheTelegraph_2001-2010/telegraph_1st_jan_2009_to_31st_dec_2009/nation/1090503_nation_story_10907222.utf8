The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Govt clears air on illicit funds
                                                                                                               Govt clears air on illicit funds
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 2: The government today said it was doing its best to recover Indian black money stashed in foreign banks, and claimed it was amending an existing pact with Switzerland to be able to get information against specific complaints.        
	The issue, which the BJP has turned into an election plank, has gained further momentum with a petition alleging the government isnt keen to act and asking the Supreme Court to intervene.        
	In an affidavit to the apex court, the Centre today said it had sought specific information from Swiss bank UBS about two Indians  a Pune-based racehorse owner and a Calcutta-based businessman. It claimed to have sought similar information from Germany about deposits in LGT Bank in Liechtenstein.        
	The petition  filed by lawyer Ram Jethmalani, constitutional expert Subhash Kashyap and former Punjab police chief K.P.S. Gill  had its first hearing on April 22. The government has handed in its reply within 10 days.        
	The central government, led by Dr Manmohan Singh played a major role in the G-20 summit seeking exchange of information (on Indian black money) and to persuade countries which were not falling in line to review their position, the affidavit said.        
	It said that although India had a double-taxation-avoidance agreement with Switzerland, Swiss authorities had consistently refused to share bank information saying the agreement did not entail such a move. The Swiss also said such information was not at their disposal under their own tax laws, the affidavit claimed.        
	However, it added, the Swiss had agreed to share such information in 2009 in keeping with norms set by the 30-country Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Following this, India has sought re-negotiation of the double-taxation-avoidance agreement to include such a clause, the affidavit said.        
	Under OECD norms, such information can be shared if there is specific information of wrongdoing; but no roving enquiry is allowed.        
	The government questioned the petitioners motives for filing such a petition at a juncture when the political, democratic process of choosing elected representatives and an executive government are under way.        
	The petition says the total Indian black money in offshore accounts is Rs 73 trillion (Rs 73 lakh crore)  which is roughly equal to the upper limit of $1.4 trillion mentioned by L.K. Advani. The BJP leader has promised to recover the money if his party comes to power.        
	Last month, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had cited economist Ashok Desais column in The Telegraph (April 7 issue), which had argued the figure was guesswork. It had also said that all the Indian money in Swiss banks might not be illicit, and that most of it would have been deposited by NRIs and therefore was almost impossible for the government to recover.        
	The affidavit said there was no authentic estimate of how much black money was lying in Swiss banks. It argued that recovery of such money involved international co-operation and political leadership, and could not be achieved through the judicial process.

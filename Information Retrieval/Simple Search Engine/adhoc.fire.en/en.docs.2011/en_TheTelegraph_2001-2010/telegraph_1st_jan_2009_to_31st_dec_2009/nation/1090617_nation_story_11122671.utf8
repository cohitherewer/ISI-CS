The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Pak chill thaws in record Russian time   No talks to more talks
                                                                                                               Pak chill thaws in record Russian time     No talks to more talks
          OUR BUREAU                          Asif Ali Zardari and Manmohan Singh shake hands in Yekaterinburg on Tuesday. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, June 16: In a swift week of overt signals and covert nudging from the US, New Delhi has gone from no talks to more talks with Pakistan.         
	But few had expected, even after Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs well meet Pakistan more than halfway statement in Parliament, that New Delhis freeze post-26/11 would melt away on the sidelines of the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation (SCO) summit at Yekaterinburg, Russia.        
	Singh left Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari a little embarrassed by stating in full media glare that his mandate is to tell you that Pakistan territory should not be used for terrorism against India, but equally, Pakistan has managed to secure what it has long sought  an apex-level meeting, albeit short, and a commitment that the foreign secretaries of the two countries will meet soon.        
	Briefing the media on the 40-minute meeting, foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon flagged Indian intentions behind the decision to meet, saying: The Prime Minister conveyed to the Pakistan President the full extent of our expectation of strong and effective steps to prevent use of Pakistani territory for terrorism against India.        
	It is not clear, though, whether there is an agreement, even if unstated, between the two leaders to expand the scope of the dialogue. As one foreign office source put it: As is the tradition of Indo-Pak talks after a chill, there are some understandings, usually arrived at as and when a high-level meeting takes place, to defuse tension; neither party goes public with these understandings.        
	Until last week, the Indian side was unprepared even to spell out whether Singh and Zardari would exchange more than just pleasantries in Russia. The Indian side has underlined that talks at the moment are limited to reviewing steps that Pakistan has taken to contain the export of terror to India and punish the actors who unleashed the Mumbai attack, but in doing so New Delhi has effected a shift in position.        
	Singh and Zardari are set to meet within a month on the sidelines of the NAM summit in Cairo; the foreign secretaries of India and Pakistan would have met before that.        
	Both countries know that dialogue is the way forward. And with the elections behind it, the Indian government can look forward to starting the dialogue along with getting some assurance from Pakistan on addressing the issue of terrorism. It is always better to do it on your own rather than be perceived as doing it under pressure from a third country like the US, said retired diplomat M.K. Bhadrakumar.        
	There has been, in recent weeks, a sense that keeping ties in limbo isnt helping and that, as the bigger nation, India should find some way of reopening doors to Pakistan.        
	Even so, there is an element of backstage US pressure to what is unfolding. US under-secretary of state William Burns, who was in New Delhi last week, had favoured resumption of dialogue and lobbied the government strongly to find a way of resuming talks. The Americans were especially keen on some visible de-escalation of tension in the subcontinent ahead of the visit of US secretary of state Hillary Clinton in July.                        Foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon and Pakistan counterpart Salman Bashir will meet soon      
	Although the composite dialogue process with Pakistan had been called off after the Mumbai attack, India and Pakistan kept open normal diplomatic channels and regular exchanges at the high commission and consular levels. A technical committee meeting on the Indus waters treaty was also held in Islamabad during this period.        
	But Pakistan has been keen on resuming the comprehensive dialogue, something that India has consistently rejected in the absence of what it calls absence of (Pakistani) determination to punish the guilty in the Mumbai (attacks) and prevent Pakistani soil being used for terror attacks on India.        
	On its part  and through third-party channels such as the US  the Pakistani leadership has been pleading earnestness of intent and arguing that it is hard pressed at the moment fighting its own, and escalating, insurgency against the Taliban.        
	Pakistan has also been keen on hosting Singh, who was born close to Islamabad in undivided India.         
	It is known that Singh himself has been keen on an official visit, which will also be a personal trip down memory lane, but domestic upheaval in Pakistan last year and the Mumbai attack thereafter have prevented any such trip being planned.

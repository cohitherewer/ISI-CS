The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Push for vote-for-none option
                                                                                                               Push for vote-for-none option
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 28: The poll panel today told the Supreme Court ballot papers and EVMs should have a none of the above option for persons unwilling to vote for any candidate, but the Centre has trashed the demand as impractical.        
	The last clause of a ballot paper and the last button on EVMs should have a none of the above option, Election Commission lawyer Meenakshi Arora said during a hearing on a PIL filed by the Peoples Union for Civil Liberties.        
	The demand for the NOTA option has grown louder since the November 26 Mumbai attacks, which saw a backlash against politicians for failing to protect the common people.        
	A court order authorising the poll panel to insert the clause cannot be implemented rightaway because of logistical reasons. Till a law is put in place, such an order would suffice as a stopgap arrangement.        
	Under existing rules, people not wishing to vote for any candidate can do so by informing the polling officer, Arora said. The voter would have to sign in the polling register and give reasons for his/her decision.        
	But the problem with this method was that the voter would have to make his dissatisfaction with candidates public, she said.        
	All the people around, the polling officers, the agents and other voters, will come to know that he has not exercised his vote, she said.        
	Before EVMs came into currency, people would cancel their votes by scribbling things like sab chor hai (all candidates are thieves), Arora said. But this would only render the ballot papers invalid.        
	Arora said the right to vote was part of a citizens right to freedom of expression and included the right to refrain from voting or stating that he/she was averse to voting against any candidate.        
	The counsel for the Centre said such a clause would not help under the Indian system of voting. He said the right to vote was a statutory duty, not a fundamental right.        
	Arguments in the case will continue tomorrow.        
	Row over poll dates        
	A day after election commissioner S.Y. Quraishi declared in London that the general election would be held between April 8 and May 15, the poll panel clarified no dates had been decided yet.         
	The Election Commission has not met so far to decide any dates for the general election. Any story quoting dates has no authenticity, a spokesperson said today.        
	Later, chief election commissioner N. Gopalaswami repeated this. The commission has not met on the dates, he said, adding that the meetings would begin next week.         
	Several political leaders, including railway minister Lalu Prasad, complained to the commission against what they said was an announcement of poll dates on foreign soil.

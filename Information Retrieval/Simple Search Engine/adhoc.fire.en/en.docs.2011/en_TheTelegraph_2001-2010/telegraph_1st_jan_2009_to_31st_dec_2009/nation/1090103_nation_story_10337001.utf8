  - Court acquits Mecca Masjid suspects          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                          A man prays at Mecca Masjid in Hyderabad. File picture                                        
	Hyderabad, Jan. 2: One year, seven months and 10 days. Thats how long Imran, 20, has missed his BTech classes.        
	He says he too is a victim of the May 18 Mecca Masjid blast last year  only he hasnt spent these past months in hospital. He has been in hell, tortured for months in jail, then forced to spend hours at a police station every third day, and in between suffer long periods of wait in courtrooms.        
	On December 31, a judge gave him and 20 others  all picked up after the May 18 and August 25 blasts in 2007  a New Year gift by acquitting them.        
	Imran, a good student from a lower middle class family, says the nightmare hasnt yet ended for him. The ghosts of those terrible days return to haunt me. My mind and my body go numb.        
	Amjadullah Khan Khalid, a leader of the Majlis Bachao Tehreek, said the verdict was proof how the police were framing young Muslim men.        
	The police had rounded up nearly 200 Muslims after blasts killed 54 people at Mecca Masjid, Lumbini Park and Gokul Chat Bhandar. The youths were hauled up from their hostels, homes and places of work and even from the roads. Some were students, some auto-rickshaw drivers, some scooter mechanics.        
	They were all classified under one broad term  suspect  and accused of waging war against the state and criminal conspiracy.        
	When their families arrived at police stations to find out about them, most of the youths were being interrogated for days at what the police call safe houses.        
	After they were freed on bail, the young men had alleged days of torture, including electric shocks. I was offered lakhs of rupees to confess, said Ibraheem Junaid, a fourth-year student of Unani medicine who too was acquitted on Wednesday.        
	Justice has prevailed, said rights activist Lateef Khan. But will the government and the police compensate them for their sufferings and the hardships of their families?        
	The state government has announced a compensation of Rs 20,000 to each of the acquitted youths so they can start some small trade or buy an auto-rickshaw. Imran, Ibrahim and another youth, all of whom have lost academic years, have been promised free coaching.        
	Imran, however, is too traumatised to study. He plans to go on Haj and then decide what he will do.        
	Judge Radha Krishna had thrown out the police case saying the prosecution had failed to furnish any evidence of guilt. The same judge had earlier this year acquitted 10 of these 21 in two other cases, related to possession of explosives and illegal procurement of SIM cards.        
	Of the original 200 suspects, some 40 are still in jail and some of them have been hauled to Gujarat to be tried for the murder of former minister Haren Pandya.

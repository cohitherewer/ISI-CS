The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Flag flutters upside down
                                                                                                               Flag flutters upside down
          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, Aug. 16: When the Tricolour was hoisted in Dantewada district yesterday, shock, instead of pride, was mirrored on faces in the audience. For the flag was upside down.        
	State child and women welfare minister Lata Usendi, who unfurled the flag, said: I noticed the lapse while the national anthem was being played. As soon as it was over, I instructed officials to rectify the mistake.         
	A head constable has been suspended for the error.        
	Usendi was the chief guest at the I-Day function in the Dantewada headquarters, which is the worst Maoist-affected district in the state. People in the interiors do not unfurl the national flag during I-Day or Republic Day celebrations.         
	Dantewada district superintendent of police Amresh Mishra said: Head constable Bhimaram Poyam was assigned the duty of the flag. He has been placed under suspension. A departmental inquiry has been ordered.

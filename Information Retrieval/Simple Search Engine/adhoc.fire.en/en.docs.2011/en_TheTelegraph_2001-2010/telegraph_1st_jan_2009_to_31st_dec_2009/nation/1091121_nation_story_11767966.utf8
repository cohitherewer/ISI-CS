          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           Rukhsana, the 21-year-old Jammu girl who killed a Lashkar-e-Toiba militant with his own gun at her residence in September. (File picture)                                   
	Silchar, Nov. 20: Shot three times by militants, a 50-year-old Assam schoolteacher succeeded in snatching their automatic rifle and saved his family before succumbing to his injuries.        
	Som Bahadur Chettry, headmaster of Birbhadra High School, had refused the Naga militants extortion demand last night when they arrived at his home in Upper Daghetar village, North Cachar Hills district.        
	One of the three militants lost his temper and fired from his AK-56, hitting Chettry on his chest and arms, police said. Even as he was dropping to the ground, the headmaster grabbed one end of the rifle and wrenched it from the attacker.        
	The militants panicked when they suddenly found themselves unarmed. The AK-56 was the only weapon they had, a police officer said.        
	Chettry shouted for help, alerting his neighbours. Sensing they could be in trouble, the trio fled. The villagers rushed Chettry to the civil hospital in (district headquarters) Haflong, which is a few kilometres away, but he died just after being brought in.        
	Two months ago, a 21-year-old Kashmiri girl, Rukhsana, had snatched an AK-47 from a Lashkar-e-Toiba commander who had entered her home and shot him dead. She was appointed a special police officer (SPO) earlier this month by the Jammu and Kashmir government as a reward for her bravery.        
	The police officer said three suspected National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) rebels had barged into Chettrys home a little after midnight and demanded Rs 15,000 as tax to the outfit.        
	The headmasters family members, confined in another room, overheard a heated argument as Chettry told the militants he could not pay such a large sum.        
	When they threatened him, Chettry offered Rs 260 which was all he had with him at the time, the officer said.        
	The headmaster is survived by his wife, two sons and a daughter. Villagers said Chettry had always taught his students to be fearless and stand up against injustice.        
	A senior district official said the family would receive Rs 3 lakh, the Assam governments earmarked compensation for any civilian killed in a militant attack.        
	However, any decision on rewarding Chettry posthumously for his act of courage will have to be taken at Dispur. We will definitely recommend his name to the government for an award. He can be an example for others in the state, especially the youngsters, the official said.        
	A police source said the NSCN (I-M) had become active in the area of late, filling a vacuum after the Jewel Gorlosa faction of the Dima Halam Daogah laid down arms.        
	A hunt has been launched for Chettrys killers. Security has been tightened in and around the village, which has a mixed population of Dimasas, Nepalis and Nagas.

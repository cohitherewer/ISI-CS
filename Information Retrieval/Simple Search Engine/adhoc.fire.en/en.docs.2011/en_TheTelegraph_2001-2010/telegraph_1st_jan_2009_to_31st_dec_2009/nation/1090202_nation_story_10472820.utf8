The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Smear scare? Dannys cool
                                                                                                               Smear scare? Dannys cool
          AMIT ROY                          A still from Slumdog Millionaire                                  
	London, Feb. 1: Is there a conspiracy, especially involving sour Bollywood types, aimed at undermining Slumdog Millionaires Oscar chances? Has the nasty backlash against what is for the moment the Oscar hot favourite been deliberately inspired?        
	Director Danny Boyle today laughed off suggestions that the films enemies in Bollywood and elsewhere were working behind the scenes, but the claim that smear tactics were being used had to be taken seriously for it had come from the Los Angeles Times. The Oscars are due to be held in Los Angeles on February 22, with Slumdog Millionaire receiving 10 nominations in nine categories.        
	According to one theory, some critics in Bollywood have had noses put out of joint because a foreigner has come along and shown them how to make a successful film with an Indian story.        
	A laughing Doyle commented today: Oh no, Im not joining in any conspiracy theories! No way, no.         
	He said: You have the privilege of making a film, people can say what they like about it. You have some films that people really like, and some films that people really dont, and thats part of the responsibility of the job. You get the chance to make it and people get the chance to say what they like about it, and Im happy for them to do that.        
	Doyle, nominated for best director, told a news agency the filmmakers had had a very precise plan to look after two of the children in the film from poor backgrounds until they were 18  certainly long after any fuss has died down.        
	He went on: Were very proud about that and were going to stick to that. Whatever happens, there is bound to be a big Indian presence in Los Angeles for the Oscars.        
	Doyle disclosed an attempt was being made to get as many Indians as possible who were involved in the film over to Hollywood for Oscar time. Were spending most of our time managing that  trying to get people on planes to come and enjoy some of the extraordinary recognition the films been given.        
	But in the Los Angeles Times, commentator Pete Hammond said in a piece entitled The conspiracy raging against Slumdog Millionaire: As noted earlier in this column, forces were at work in India trying to disparage Danny Boyles surprise hit and awards magnet leading to a front page LA Times story last Saturday pointing out some of the negative criticism essentially saying the film is a white mans vision of a slum-ridden India.        
	He pointed out that a story kicking around since early in the season about the treatment of some of the local Indian child actors reared its ugly head again with allegations that the films producers and distributors paid them dirt cheap wages and have not been concerned with their welfare.        
	He noted the suspicious circumstances around its re-emergence on the very day Oscar ballots were being mailed.         
	Hammond revealed: I spoke to a senior Fox (distributor Fox Searchlight) executive who said he found these tactics appearing against Slumdog to be reprehensible. He added that its a sad state of affairs for the industry that the race for Oscar has to come down to this level. The exec does not believe this story was just a coincidence of timing and theorised that there were probably other factors that had something to do with fanning the flames against Slumdog at a critical time in the Academy process.        
	In another article, Slumdog backlash on schedule, in the same paper, writer Patrick Goldstein observed: Whenever theres an overwhelming favourite in the Oscar race, you can be sure, human nature being human nature, and the media being the media in short an institution that likes to build em up and then knock em down  that the overwhelming favourite will soon find itself fighting off a nasty backlash. Thats exactly whats happening right now in the Oscar race to Danny Boyles Slumdog Millionaire, which in recent days has gone from beloved underdog to embattled frontrunner.        
	There are those in the West who have followed critics in India in hammering Slumdog for allegedly exploiting the poverty of India. Why is Slumdog suddenly coming under attack? wondered Goldstein. First, let me put my cards on the table. Slumdog Millionaire is my favourite movie of the year.        
	He argued: Todays critics, who are invariably the torchbearers of the backlash, are suspicious, if not openly hostile, of any piece of art that is granted too much widespread  i.e. uncritical  public acceptance. He concluded: One of the worst afflictions of our media age is that many of our most persuasive cultural apparatchiks are almost instinctively wary of commercial success, as if it were a curse instead of a delightful, altogether unlikely blessing for an artist. Whether youre a critic or simply a loyal fan, when you see a film that rocks your world, dont second-guess your instincts. Theres nothing wrong with love at first sight.        
	A news report in the paper said Fox Searchlight wanted to bring all nine of the films young performers to the Oscars.         
	To this, Boyle has responded: Theyre all desperate to come. But then you have to worry about exposing them, even if its just a flash, to this world.

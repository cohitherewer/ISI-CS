          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Chief minister Naveen Patnaik at the meeting on Saturday. Telegraph picture                                  
	Bhubaneswar, June 13: Chief minister Naveen Patnaik today directed secretaries to draw up five-year perspective plans for their respective departments.        
	The directive was issued at a meeting of the secretaries  the first after the recent Lok Sabha and Assembly polls in which Naveen received a massive mandate.        
	Naveen, who is holding office as chief minister for the third consecutive term, apparently wanted to lay down a set of guidelines for bureaucrats for the next five years. The chief minister asked departmental heads to finalise their perspective plans within a fortnight in consultation with their ministers.        
	He stressed on effective and sincere implementation of various welfare schemes such as Rs 2 per kg rice scheme for the poor, the Madhubabu Pension Yojana, Gopabandhu Gramin Yojana, Mission Shakti, Employment Mission and Infant Mortality Reduction Mission, Pani Panchayat and Bijili-Sadak-Pani programme.        
	Underscoring the need for periodic monitoring of various government programmes, the chief minister said annual, quarterly and monthly targets should be fixed for departmental programmes. Chief secretary, development commissioner and agriculture production commissioners should monitor these targets from time to time. Similarly, directors and chief engineers should monitor at their level.        
	The directors and chief engineers should go for field visits for at least 10 days a month, while district collectors should visit each block and tehsil in their district at least once a month, he said.        
	There should be well co-ordination between each government department, directorate and district through e-governance, Naveen said, advising the secretaries to properly maintain management information system.        
	Stressing on the grievance redressal mechanism, Naveen said every Saturday would be declared as grievance day from the secretariat to block level.        
	Laying emphasis on field inspection by the secretaries and revenue divisional commissioners, the chief minister said they should regularly review implementation of various poverty-alleviation schemes.         
	Each and every field staff would be held responsible for implementation of government programmes at their level, he said.        
	The meeting was attended by chief secretary Ajit Kumar Tripathy, development commissioner Tarunkanti Mishra, agriculture production commissioner Satya Prakash Nanda, principal secretary to chief minister Bijoy Kumar Patnaik, besides the departmental secretaries.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Childs rocket sparks riot
                                                                                                               Childs rocket sparks riot
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 18: A stray Diwali rocket fired by a child caused an entire middle-class neighbourhood to erupt in battle last night, replete with scenes of women dressed in all their finery trying to pull each others hair out.        
	The scrap in east Delhis Trilokpuri underscored how the capitals residents remain on a short fuse even during a festival of goodwill.        
	Children had been playing with fireworks in front of Madhuban Singhs house when, around 10.15, a rocket landed on its terrace and burnt holes in clothes that had been hung to dry.        
	Madhuban, his brothers Bhisham, Rambir and Lalit and their uncle Dharambir rushed out and scolded the children, who ran into their house and informed grandfather Sheeshram. He and his sons Ravi, Rajkumar and Raju beat up Madhuban and his family members, including some women, with sticks.        
	Neighbours joined in on both sides, breaking windows, damaging cars and attacking each other. For half an hour, the locality turned into a riot zone till police arrived and broke up the two groups. Five men and two women were admitted to hospital while Sheeshram and his sons were arrested.        
	We were shocked when we reached the scene. Women dressed in their best and men in kurta-pyjamas were vandalising their own neighbourhood, an officer said. At least 50 people were screaming for one anothers blood.        
	This wasnt the only instance of a minor mishap spilling blood in Delhi yesterday. A man was stabbed to death by three friends when his bike brushed against theirs.        
	Police figures suggest that murders over trivial issues are rising in Delhi, from 14 per cent of all murders (569) in 2007 to 17 per cent (of 518) in 2008 to nearly 20 per cent so far this year.        
	On Friday, Dinesh, 22, was allegedly throttled to death by his friend Ashok and his father, apparently because he had borrowed Ashoks mobile phone without telling him. When Dinesh came to return it, he was beaten up and strangled.

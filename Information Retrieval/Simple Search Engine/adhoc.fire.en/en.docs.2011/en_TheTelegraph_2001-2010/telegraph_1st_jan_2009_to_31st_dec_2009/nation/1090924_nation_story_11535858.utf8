The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | IIT faculty stick to strike 
                                                                                                               IIT faculty stick to strike 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 23: Faculty at the IITs today indicated they would continue with their protest over a controversial new pay regime, questioning arguments used by education minister Kapil Sibal yesterday to dismiss their demands.         
	Comparing the IITs with universities to suggest that teacher at the engineering schools receive better pay is misleading because of the nature of autonomy the former set of institutions have enjoyed, the apex IIT faculty body said.         
	The All India IIT Faculty Federation, in a resolution also suggested that Sibal may have misunderstood some of their concerns. The human resource development minister should meet them to resolve the impasse, the forum said.         
	Sibal had yesterday told the IIT faculty not to focus on protests and to produce future Nobel laureates instead.         
	The faculty and the ministry are locked in an unprecedented pay dispute after the government snipped salaries proposed by a central panel.         
	The faculty are arguing that poor pay cripples their ability to compete with private and foreign universities and industry in hiring bright young PhDs at a time when they already suffer a severe teacher crunch. On an average, between 25 and 40 per cent teaching posts have been vacant in the IITs over the past few years.

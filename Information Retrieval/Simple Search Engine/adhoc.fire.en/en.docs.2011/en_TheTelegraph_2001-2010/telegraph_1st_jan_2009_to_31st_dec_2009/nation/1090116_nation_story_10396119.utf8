The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Axe over Amar insult
                                                                                                               Axe over Amar insult
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 15: The Congress today showed how serious it was about a Samajwadi tie-up  it dropped Satyavrat Chaturvedi as spokesperson for saying Amar Singh needed a check-up from neck up.        
	Chaturvedi  who was giving sound bites to TV yesterday  has not addressed a single news conference since being included in the spokespersons panel last year, but the leaderships move is still being seen as a statement of intent.        
	Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav and Amar had earlier met the Prime Minister on Tuesday to tell him how hurt they were at the repeated attacks on them by senior Congress functionaries such as Digvijay Singh and Chaturvedi.        
	A few months ago, Chaturvedi had called Amar insane and recommended he visit a shrink. The Samajwadi leaders mentioned this in the three-page statement they read out to Manmohan Singh.        
	After that first insult, the Prime Minister had asked Chaturvedi to say sorry to Amar but he did not.        
	What made Chaturvedis position untenable was his reiteration of the insult yesterday, a day after Singh had promised Mulayam and Amar he would see they were not humiliated again.        
	Singh told the Samajwadi duo how much he valued their support to his government, particularly because they did not expect any perks like ministerships.        
	Soon after the meeting, the urban development ministry was told to hurry up with land allocation for the Samajwadi party office in Delhi. The party has its headquarters in Lutyens Zone but wants another office because the Bahujan Samaj Party has got two bungalows in exchange for its votes to the UPA in the 2007 presidential election.        
	Congress sources said the government would try and accede to the other Samajwadi demands  relating variously to court cases and business matters  within the possible constitutional and legal parameters.

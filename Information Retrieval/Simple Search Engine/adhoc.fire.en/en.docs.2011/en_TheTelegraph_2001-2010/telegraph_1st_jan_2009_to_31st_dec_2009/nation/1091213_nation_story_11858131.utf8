				       Day 6                  Protesters dressed as pandas with flames on their   heads at a rally outside the Danish parliament in   Copenhagen on Saturday. (AP)        Dragon fire  China attacked US chief   negotiator Todd Stern as either ldquo;extremely irresponsible rdquo; or lacking in common sense for saying he could not ldquo;envision rdquo; US climate aid going to China.
    Chinese vice-foreign   minister He Yafei said that was a   dangerous betrayal of a globally agreed principle that rich nations had a responsibility to help poor nations adapt to a warmer world and cut emissions.
    ldquo;I was shocked, personally, to read the American negotiator rsquo;s (comment), rdquo; he said. ldquo;I don rsquo;t want to say the gentleman is   ignorant, because he is very 
  well educated, but I think he lacked common sense when he made such a comment hellip;.   Either lack of common sense or he is extremely irresponsible. rdquo;  He compared the wealthy   world to people eating at a   fancy restaurant, who are joined for dessert by a poor friend, and then demand he pays a share   of the whole meal  Stern posture  The US contested key elements of the official draft proposal,   saying proposals on emission curbs were ldquo;unbalanced rdquo; since emerging giant economies were not being pressed enough to slash their carbon output.
    ldquo;If we are talking about the need to keep the temperature increase below 2 deg;C rise as compared to pre-industrial levels... you can rsquo;t even have that discussion if the major developing countries are not taking a major role, rdquo; US chief negotiator Todd Stern said.   ldquo;This structure reflects lsquo;old think rsquo;, if   you will. We can rsquo;t solve the   problem that way. rdquo;
  He said other aspects of   the seven-page draft, to be   submitted in final to ministers ahead of next Friday rsquo;s crunch summit, were acceptable.  Ministers arrive  Environment ministers from around the world began arriving in Copenhagen on Saturday to ramp up pressure on climate negotiators. The ministers will have nearly a week of public and private talks before more than 100 heads of states and governments come to the Danish capital next week              Danish model Helena Christensen addresses demonstrators in Copenhagen. (AP)      Tuvalu tears  The Pacific Island of   Tuvalu, fearing that rising sea levels could wipe it   off the map, has stuck to   its calls for   consideration of a radical new treaty that would   force far deeper cuts in greenhouse gases than those under consideration.
    ldquo;The fate of my country rests in your hands, rdquo; Ian   Fry, leading the Tuvalu   delegation, told the   meeting. ldquo;I make this as a strong and impassioned plea. hellip; I woke this morning and   I was crying and that was not easy for a grown man to admit, rdquo; he said, choking as he spoke in   the plenary crowded with hundreds of delegates  Aussie march  Thousands took to the streets   of Australia rsquo;s main cities on   Saturday at the start of an 
  international day of action to pressure the Copenhagen   conference for strong action 
  on climate change.
    In Melbourne, marchers closed   the ldquo;Walk Against Warming rdquo;   by spelling out the words ldquo;Safe   Climate mdash; Do It! rdquo; on the   ground. Organisers said aerial photographs were taken and sent to delegates in   Copenhagen.
    Protesters in Sydney carried   placards saying: ldquo;I like clean   energy and I vote rdquo;, ldquo;No meat, 
  no heat rdquo; and ldquo;No new coal mines rdquo;, a reference to   Australia rsquo;s status as a leading exporter of coal  Agencies

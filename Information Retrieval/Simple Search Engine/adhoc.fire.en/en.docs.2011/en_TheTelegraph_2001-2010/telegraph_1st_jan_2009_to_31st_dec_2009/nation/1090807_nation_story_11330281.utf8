          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Fehmida Sayyed in Mumbai on Thursday. (AFP)                                  
	Mumbai, Aug. 6: A court today sentenced three persons to death for the August 2003 twin blasts in Mumbai, including a mother of three who, if hanged, will be the first woman to be executed in a terror case in independent India.        
	Fehmida Sayyed, 43, received the death sentence with her auto driver husband Hanif, 46, and Ashrat Ansari, 32  alleged Lashkar-e-Toiba operatives convicted last week of the blasts that killed 52 people and injured 244.        
	The trio should be hanged by neck till they die, anti-terror (Pota) judge M.R. Puranik said.        
	The bearded Hanif remained calm but Fehmida broke down when the police escorted the couple away to send them to different jails.        
	An agitated Ansari cried out: Is andhe kanoon se kya insaaf milega (what justice can a blind law deliver)?        
	The Sayyeds have been convicted of planting a bomb in the boot of a taxi in which they had travelled to the Gateway of India with their two daughters, then aged 16 and 3, before getting off and asking the driver to wait. Ansari allegedly left a bomb in another taxi at trading hub Zaveri Bazaar. The attacks were apparently revenge for the Gujarat riots.        
	The trio had pleaded for leniency and a life sentence, Fehmida saying her daughters and son, who is in his 20s, should not be orphaned.        
	Defence lawyer Sushan Kunjuraman said his clients would appeal against the verdict. Lawyer Majeed Memon said the judgment would have to be sent to Bombay High Court for ratification anyway.        
	Carrying out a death sentence can be a lengthy process, involving appeals in the Supreme Court and a mercy petition to the President. Although women have been sentenced to death in terror cases in India, such as Nalini in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, they have had their sentences commuted to a life term. In the 1993 serial blasts case, four women were awarded life sentences.        
	No woman has yet been executed in the country after Independence. In August 2006, a court had handed the death penalty to sisters Renuka Shinde and Seema Gavit, who kidnapped babies and killed them, but they are still in jail, hoping for a presidential pardon.

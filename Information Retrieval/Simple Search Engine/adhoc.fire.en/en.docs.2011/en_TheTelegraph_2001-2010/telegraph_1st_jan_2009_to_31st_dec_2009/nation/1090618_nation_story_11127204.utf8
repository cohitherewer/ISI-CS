The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Fast food joint near your home? Youll get fatter
                                                                                                               Fast food joint near your home? Youll get fatter
          G.S. MUDUR                          Danger zone?                                  
	New Delhi, June 17: Living in neighbourhoods that have more fast food outlets than grocers or vegetable markets appears to increase the risk of obesity, but only within a zone of 800 metres, said a new study released today.         
	The study by Canadian researchers bolsters evidence for a commonsensical notion that differences in the kind of food stores in the neighbourhood could contribute to disparities in obesity which has been questioned by previous research.         
	The researchers observed a 28 per cent difference in the prevalence of obesity within 800 metres in neighbourhoods where the number of fast food outlets was higher than the number of grocers or supermarkets selling fruits, vegetables or uncooked food.         
	The lower the ratio of fast food restaurants and convenience stores to grocery or produce stores, the lower the chances of being obese, according to the study published in the journal BioMedCentral Public Health.         
	But the study did not reveal any association between fast food outlets within 1,600 metres of homes and obesity.         
	The implication would be that beyond 800 metres, the influence weakens.         
	The proximity of the obesogenic environment to individuals appears to be an important factor in their risk for obesity, John Spence from the University of Alberta, Edmonton, and his colleagues wrote in their paper.         
	The study was conducted in the city of Edmonton where, the scientists said, residents are typically exposed to five times more fast food restaurants within 800 metres of their homes than grocery stores or vendors of farm produce.         
	An Indian public health specialist said the findings would be relevant to India where modern fast food outlets are competing with vendors of traditional Indian junk food.         
	We need to distinguish between fast food and junk food  but the density of junk food outlets in our country could be very high, said Monica Arora, the director of Hriday-School Health Action Network, a non-government agency promoting health among adolescents. In urban areas, we have neighbourhoods with high concentrations of junk food vendors, Arora said.         
	The Canadian study based on 2,900 adults in Edmonton observed a difference of about 4 per cent (12.7 per cent versus 16.3 per cent) in obesity among people living close to areas with high concentrations of fast food outlets.         
	Spence, the studys lead author, said the 4 per cent variance has public health significance. Access to full-service grocery stores with fruits and vegetables is important for the health of the population, Spence told The Telegraph.         
	Although previous studies in the US have suggested similar links between obesity and access to fast food outlets, the evidence was challenged last year by Australian researchers.         
	Kylie Ball and her colleagues from Deakin University in Melbourne had examined girls and their fathers in the city of Melbourne with at least one fast food outlet within 2km of their homes and found no evidence to support the idea that proximity to fast food outlets increases risk of obesity.         
	Their results  published in the International Journal of Pediatric Obesity  showed that among older girls, the likelihood of being overweight or obese actually reduced by 14 per cent with each additional fast food outlet within 2km. And the fathers chances of being overweight or obese increased by 13 per cent for each additional kilometre to the nearest outlet.

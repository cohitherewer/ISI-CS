	New Delhi, June 15: The Election Commission has immediately sought details of Lok Sabha poll expenses incurred by parties and candidates. The deadline for filing ends tomorrow.        
	The poll panel has already written to district returning officers and state election officers to send the statements immediately after June 16 for scrutiny.         
	The commission will then dispatch these affidavits to the income-tax department, an Election Commission official said. The expense details have to be filed within a month of the election results, which were declared on May 16 this time. Lok Sabha candidates can spend up to Rs 25 lakh. For the Assembly, the limit is Rs 10 lakh.        
	The poll panel can debar a candidate from contesting for three years for failure to file such statements.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Clean beach gift for Gopalpur
                                                                                                               Clean beach gift for Gopalpur
          PRIYA ABRAHAM                              
	Bhubaneswar, July 8: Visitors to the palm-fringed beaches of Gopalpur-on-sea can now look forward to spruced up sandy beaches and cleaner resorts.         
	The picturesque seaside town will be receiving a much-needed facelift with the administration on its toes to rid the beach of the litter and stink.         
	Worried by a steady decline in the flow of tourists, the administration has decided to go for a major cleanliness and beautification drive. Previously, the town received 283,040 visitors in 2007, a number that was reduced to 282,709 in 2008. While the number of foreign tourists increased from 890 to 987, the number of domestic tourists went down from 282,150 to 281,722 in 2008, said the district tourist officer, Sukant Pattnaik.        
	Improved sanitation facilities, construction of new roads and the repair of the existing ones leading to the beach, will be the priority this season.        
	Cleanliness would be the key and the towns biggest draw. The drive will be entrusted to private parties, said district collector V.K. Pandian. Besides, the administration is also ready with a proposal for a hanging-bridge at the towns backwater area  Haripur.         
	The administration has also decided to beautify the waterfronts by introducing water sports facilities. We have almost developed a park which will open by September, said Pattnaik. The major hurdle before the park project is the rehabilitation of slum-dwellers who have been living within the project area limits for years now.         
	The estimated cost for the entire project is slated around Rs 10.5 crore. While hoteliers have agreed to shell out 50 per cent of the total project cost, the Notified Area Council will be providing for 30 per cent of the costs.         
	The remaining 20 per cent will be borne by the Beach Development Committee. Hoteliers should ideally play a bigger role, Pandian believes.        
	Meanwhile, accommodation facilities in the area have decreased from 450 rooms to 320. The fall in tourist numbers discouraged many and three hotels were changed into students hostels, Pattnaik said.        
	However, larger players such as Swosti, Kamath and Sinclairs Groups of hotels are keen to start their ventures in the beach town and have applied for land.

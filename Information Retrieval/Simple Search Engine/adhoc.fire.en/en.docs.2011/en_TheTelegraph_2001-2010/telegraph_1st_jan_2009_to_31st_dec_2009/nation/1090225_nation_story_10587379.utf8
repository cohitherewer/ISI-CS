          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Ahmedabad, Feb. 24: Gujarat High Court today issued notices to minister Mayaben Kodnani and former VHP general secretary Jaideep Patel  accused in the 2002 riots  asking them to explain why their anticipatory bails should not be cancelled.        
	The notices by Justice D.H. Waghela are returnable on March 2. This enables Kodnani to attend the budget session of the Assembly which gets over on February 27.        
	Last Thursday, Justice A.S. Dave had refused to hear the case involving Kodnani, the states women and child welfare minister, and Patel, a former VHP functionary who is now a Narendra Modi loyalist.         
	Not before me, Justice Dave had said when the matter came before him. The chief justice had then assigned the case to Justice Waghela.        
	The special investigation team appointed by the Supreme Court had filed three applications  two in Kodnanis case and one for Patel  to get their anticipatory bails cancelled.        
	On February 5, additional sessions judge A.K. Aswani had granted them anticipatory bail. The SIT had issued two notices, on January 29 and 31, asking them to surrender.         
	The two leaders went into hiding as they apparently got wind that the SIT was going to arrest them.         
	After getting government consent for seeking cancellation of her anticipatory bail, the SIT told the high court that Kodnani fired from her pistol at residents of Naroda Patia, her Assembly seat, where 96 people were killed in the 2002 riots.

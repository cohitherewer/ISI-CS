The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Suketu silent on Boyle film
                                                                                                               Suketu silent on Boyle film
          AMIT ROY                               
	London, June 3: Danny Boyle wants to make another movie in Mumbai but it was not clear today whether that would be based on Suketu Mehtas best selling account of his native city in the raw, Maximum City: Bombay Lost and Found.        
	Ask Danny Boyle, was the comment from Mehta, when The Telegraph spoke to him today in New York.        
	It is known that Boyle is an admirer of Maximum City and used it for background when he was shooting Slumdog Millionaire in Mumbai.        
	He is on record as stating the book became my bible, really. I took it with me everywhere.        
	Boyle has also said that he enjoyed the experience of working in India so much that he wanted to return to Mumbai to make another film, possibly a thriller.        
	Mehta did confirm he is now writing a book on New York as well as a series of lectures for a tour of Italy.        
	Meanwhile, BBC Films have bought Vikas Swarups second novel, Six Suspects, but indications are that he will not direct the film. The screenplay is being written by John Hodge, who has done the screenplays for Trainspotting and Shallow Grave, two of Boyles earlier films.        
	Swarups debut novel, Q amp;A, was adapted by Simon Beaufoy who won an Oscar for his screenplay. But at the Oscar ceremony, Swarup was denied a ticket in his own right and was allowed into the Kodak Theatre only as Beaufoys guest.        
	When his novel was reissued after the success of the film, it was renamed Slumdog Millionaire.        
	Since Maximum City is not a linear story but a series of snapshots and sketches, it will require an imaginative screenwriter to turn it into a movie.        
	Finding a worthy successor to Slumdog will not be easy. On a budget of 15million, if that, the global office takings have exceeded $350 million. These figures have also turned Boyle into one of the most sought after directors in the world.

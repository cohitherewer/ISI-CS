	 New Delhi, Dec. 2 (PTI): CPM leader Brinda Karat today demanded in the Rajya Sabha the arrest of Google India chief and impose a ban on the site for putting up advertisements related to pre-natal sex tests.

	 Calcutta: A murder convict jailed for life ran away with his handcuffs on when three policemen were walking him to the bus terminus at Esplanade. Buddheswar Pramanik, 40, originally from Duttabad in Salt Lake, had been brought to the city from Behrampore Central Jail on a bus on Wednesday in connection with another case. Behrampore police said they could not afford a prison van for a lone convict unless it was a very special case. Two home-guards and a constable took an auto and a bus to reach Esplanade from a Salt Lake court on Wednesday. Pramanik, who was lodged in a city prison earlier, had been shifted a few months ago after clashing with other inmates.

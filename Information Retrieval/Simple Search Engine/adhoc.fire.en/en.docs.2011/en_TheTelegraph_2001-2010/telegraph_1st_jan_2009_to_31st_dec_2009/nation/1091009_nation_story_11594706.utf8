The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Loyalist Venkaiah thickens Advani quit plot
                                                                                                               Loyalist Venkaiah thickens Advani quit plot
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Advani at Faridabad. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 8: L.K. Advani loyalist M. Venkaiah Naidu has indicated that Advani will quit as leader of the Opposition at a time of his choosing, and will also select his successor.        
	Nobody was sure if Naidu, a former BJP president, had spoken on his own or had been put up to the job. Naidu is part of the quartet of Advani loyalists that includes Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj and Ananth Kumar.        
	Sources said the four were pragmatic in their own way. They had been critical of Advani in the past, especially when they felt the tide turning against him on a particular issue, such as his praise of Mohammed Ali Jinnah in 2005.        
	In an interview with Karan Thapar on Devils Advocate, to be telecast over the weekend, Naidu was quoted as saying Advani would not contest the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, nor would he lead the BJP into that election. Parts of the interview were put out on the CNN-IBN TV website.        
	Outlining a road map for the BJP that departed a bit from the one unveiled by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, Naidu said it was logical that the party would need a new leader by 2014, and a change of guard would therefore take place a couple of years before that.        
	Bhagwat, in a recent TV interview, had made two points on Advani.        
	One, the RSS had not asked him to quit as leader of the Opposition after the BJPs election defeat, nor had it told him to withdraw his resignation. Both were Advanis own decisions. Two, the BJP should bring about a generation change at all levels; it was up to the party itself to decide when and how.        
	The BJPs understanding was that the RSS would want Advani to step down simultaneously with Rajnath Singh. Rajnath is to make way for a new party president in December this year.                  Venkaiah Naidu      
	Naidus assertions, however, have again confused the party. Some believe that Advani will continue till the end of this Lok Sabhas term unless the RSS intervenes.        
	Many expect Advani to still have the last laugh, given the perception that the Sangh wont push its wishes beyond a point. Definitely not beyond getting BJP leaders to make barbed comments that were withdrawn almost immediately, such as Manohar Parrikars apparent comparison of Advani to a pickle gone bad.        
	Naidu said: Whenever he (Advani) wants to make way for others, it is his choice. Nobody has given him any deadline.        
	He also claimed that Advani did not want to continue as leader of the Opposition but had been persuaded by the party to remain.        
	When you lose an election and that too for the second time, there will be a certain amount of demoralisation, so we wanted him to guide (us). The process of leadership change is a normal process. So when he wants to choose a new leader, it will be announced by Advani.        
	Naidu also hinted that action might be taken against Arun Shourie for his remarks against Advani and Rajnath.

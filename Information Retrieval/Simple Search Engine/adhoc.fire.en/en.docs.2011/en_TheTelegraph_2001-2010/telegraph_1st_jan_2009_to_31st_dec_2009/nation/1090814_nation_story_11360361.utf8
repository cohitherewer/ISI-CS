The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Push to remove Bangla dam fears 
                                                                                                               Push to remove Bangla dam fears 
          JAYANTH JACOB                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 13: New Delhi hopes to dispel Dhakas concerns that an upcoming Manipur hydel project will divert water from a river system flowing into Bangladesh.         
	Sources said the efforts to convince the neighbour would get a push during Bangladesh foreign minister Dipu Monis Delhi visit, expected in early September.        
	The sources said the Tipaimukh project, on the Barak which flows through Manipur into Bangladesh, had created unnecessary doubts in certain quarters in Dhaka.        
	Delhi, they said, is ready to explain all the points to convince Dhaka that it will benefit, instead. The dam, coming up as part of the project, will help Dhaka in flood control, while ensuring water during dry spells, the sources said.        
	Political parties and experts in Bangladesh have claimed that the dam will leave Sylhet, in the countrys north-east, parched.         
	A parliamentary delegation led by Abdur Razzaq had travelled to the dam site late last month. Monis visit will further help to dispel the misgivings, the sources said.        
	The sources said some parts of the establishment in Dhaka were unnecessarily worried about whether any bilateral treaty on the dam would be effective. The Indus water treaty between India and Pakistan has stood the test of time, said a diplomat, citing an example.

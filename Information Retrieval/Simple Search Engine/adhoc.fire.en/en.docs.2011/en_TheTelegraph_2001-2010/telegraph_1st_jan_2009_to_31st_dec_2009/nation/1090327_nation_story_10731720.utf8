The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitish school U-turn 
                                                                                                               Nitish school U-turn 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, March 26: Unwelcome islands of pomp have evolved into objects of desire for the Bihar government  within a month.        
	The state is wooing the Centre for a share of proposed government-sponsored elite schools less than a month after chief minister Nitish Kumar rejected the concept as discriminatory against other schools.         
	It has now requested the human resource development ministry for the centrally funded model schools described by Nitish as elitist, The Telegraph has learnt.         
	The model schools are meant to act as exemplars. The Union cabinet has approved 2,500 such schools so far, one each for the most educationally backward blocks.        
	The turnaround could prove embarrassing to explain for the chief minister  a self-professed champion of common schooling who has won accolades for his development schemes.        
	On February 28, the Bihar government leaked to the media contents of a letter that Nitish wrote to HRD minister Arjun Singh, urging modifications in the school scheme.         
	Nitish argued in his letter that the funds meant for the model schools should instead be used to set up a greater number of cheaper schools. He also contended that the scheme would be violative of the Bihar governments move under him to shift to a common schooling system.        
	The proposed model schools would stand out as islands of pomp amid other schools not having similar facilities and this would not be in keeping with our policy of development with justice, Nitish wrote to Singh.         
	But now, the Bihar government has made a pitch for the same exclusive schools, ministry sources said. Its quite a U-turn, from the high moralistic position opposing the schools as elite hubs, to requesting for them, a source said.

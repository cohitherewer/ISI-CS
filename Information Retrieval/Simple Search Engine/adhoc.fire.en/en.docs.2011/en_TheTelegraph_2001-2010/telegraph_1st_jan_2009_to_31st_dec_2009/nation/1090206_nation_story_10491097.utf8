The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Change in poll pattern
                                                                                                               Change in poll pattern
          OUR BUREAU                          Cuttack ready to vote                                  
	Cuttack, Feb. 5: As Cuttack votes for its municipal corporation on Friday, a change is foreseen in the polling pattern and percentage across the 54 wards.         
	A silent swing is likely to effect the fortunes of the three main contenders for power  BJD, Congress and BJP.         
	While BJD and Congress are vying for majority, the BJP is limited to saving its corporator tally in the last council. There are 20 wards in which the margin between the BJD and the Congress oscillates from 300 votes to 600 votes. Reports indicate that the BJD has inched its way ahead in 11 wards, the Congress in seven and the BJP in six.         
	The fight is tough in 10 wards with BJD, BJP and Congress rebel candidates and CPI, Samrudha Orissa and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) candidates in the fray.         
	Majority of voters think Naveen Patnaik is apparently the best bet for the next five years. A section is disenchanted with the BJP thus the party is likely to slip down from its last term corporator tally.         
	Accordingly, much will depend on how Cuttack responds to the aggressive campaigns, especially by BJD boss and chief minister Naveen Patnaik, which ended on Wednesday evening.         
	No other chief minister had ever campaigned so extensively in any municipal elections.         
	Poll predictions apart, the last civic polls performance of BJD, BJP and Congress vis--vis changed electoral matrix this time due to the creation of six new wards by splitting 14 of the existing wards according to population-area ratio under delimitation exercise cannot be lost sight altogether.         
	The failure to strike a pre-poll alliance had affected both the BJD and BJP  the ruling alliance in the state.        
	Petition rejected        
	Orissa High Court today rejected all six writ petitions that had raised dispute related to delimitation and reservation of wards in CMC and imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 on each of the petitioners.        
	The city is expected be placed under heavy police bandobast for the civic polls on Friday following official reports that 75 per cent of election booths in Cuttack are susceptible to violence.         
	The state election commission had emphasised on the need to have adequate police bandobast at 136 election booths that have been classified as hyper sensitive and the 185 as sensitive.        
	Officials said 72 sections of armed police force would be deployed for round-the-clock vigil at the 425 voting sites on Friday.

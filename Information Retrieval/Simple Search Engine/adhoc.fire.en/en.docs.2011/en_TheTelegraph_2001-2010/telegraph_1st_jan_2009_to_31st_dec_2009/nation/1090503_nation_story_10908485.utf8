The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | PM on Quattrocchi
                                                                                                               PM on Quattrocchi
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 2: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today broke his silence on Bofors accused Ottavio Quattrocchis name being dropped from Interpols list of wanted, and said it was not good to harass anyone when the world says we have no case.         
	In a television interview, Singh described the case of the Italian businessman as an embarrassment for the Indian government because it had failed to get him extradited from Malaysia and Argentina, where the courts have said we dont have a strong case against him.         
	It is not a good reflection on the Indian legal system that we harass people while the world says we have no case, the Prime Minister said.        
	Interpol removed the red corner notice against Quattrocchi on the CBIs advice last month. The Opposition has sharply criticised the move.        
	But Singh said Interpol had asked India why Quattrocchi was being kept under the red corner notice. The matter was then referred to the law ministry, which sought the attorney-generals opinion and was told there was no case for keeping the notice, the Prime Minister added.        
	Singh also said he was ready for a post-poll tie-up with the Left, but not at the cost of giving up the Indo-US nuclear deal. Asked about the Congress-led UPAs chances of forming a government at the Centre, he said he was confident about winning.         
	To a question if the UPA would seek Left support if it failed to get majority, Singh said: Politics is the art of the possible. Who do we reach out to and who do we not reach is a matter we can only talk about when the election results are known. We have worked with the Left before. For four years they were our partners. I have enjoyed working with the Left. I have many friends. I think (Bengal chief minister) Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is a very good friend of mine.        
	But the Prime Minister said there would be no negotiations on the Indo-US nuclear deal. There is no question of giving up the deal. That situation will not arise. I dont think any serious-minded Indian party would ask that we should annul the deal.

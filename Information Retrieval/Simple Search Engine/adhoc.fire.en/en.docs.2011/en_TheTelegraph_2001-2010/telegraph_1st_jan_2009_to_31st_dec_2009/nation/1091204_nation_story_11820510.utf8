The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Koda shadow on Games village builder

	New Delhi, Dec. 3: Investigations into the alleged Rs 2,000-crore hawala scam that has embroiled former Jharkhand chief minister Madhu Koda today led the Enforcement Directorate to the offices of Emaar MGF, the company building the Commonwealth Games Village.        
	Directorate sources confirmed that at least 10 offices of the company, a joint venture between Emaar Properties of Dubai and the Delhi-based MGF group, were searched since morning in connection with the scam.        
	The searches, mostly in the National Capital Region, came just five months after the Delhi Development Authority had to bail out the then cash-strapped Emaar MGF with a Rs 760-crore package.         
	Sources said officials who conducted the searches found documents that showed Kodas associates on the board of some Emaar group companies. The searches followed revelations by Bikash Sinha, one of Kodas associates now in judicial custody, who told investigators that he and some others had made investments on behalf of Koda in the company.         
	Emaar officials refused to comment on the raids.        
	The sources said the Enforce Directorate (ED) officials also searched the Delhi homes and offices of some board members of the company who they alleged were directly linked to the scam and helped Koda transfer money out of the country.        
	The raids were in connection with violation of Fema regulations and diverting money abroad. We are also investigating if the company has been bringing money into the country in violation of foreign exchange rules, and using the funds to buy agricultural land, a source in the Directorate told The Telegraph.        
	Four years ago, Emaar MGF had brought in Indias largest foreign investment in real estate.         
	Another man believed to have led the ED to crack down on Emaar is Kodas close aide Devendra Mukhia, who surrendered on November 9 in Ranchi.        
	Mukhia, a familiar sight in real estate hubs in Noida, is a big draw among builders in the area as a troubleshooter and a fixer. Investigations are on to find out if Mukhias name appeared in any documents found in the Emaar offices relating to real estate bought in the area for Koda.        
	The sources also said another accused in the scam, Sanjay Chowdhury  Kodas suspected front man for all alleged dubious deals who had left for Dubai as soon the ED registered a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act  was involved with the company. Investigators believe he facilitated the inclusion of Kodas men into the board of the company.        
	ED sources said that Chowdhury, allegedly a member of most companies that Koda is accused of setting up to siphon off money abroad, could also be on the board of Emaar. The sources said the directorate would soon move court for revoking Chowdhurys passport.        
	The Commonwealth Games organising committee, however, doesnt see the searches as a threat to the construction work at the Games village that has a deadline of August 2010  or two months before the showpiece event begins on October 3.         
	I dont see a problem with the continuation of work at the Emaar MGF Commonwealth Games Village site. This is a statutory thing that will continue. The company has many other projects and they might have problems with those, the CWG has nothing to do with it, said Games chief operating officer Vijay Kumar Gautam.

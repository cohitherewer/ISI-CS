The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Rail tapped for vigil 
                                                                                                               Rail tapped for vigil 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 15: After the farmers of Singur and the tribals of Lalgarh, Mamata Banerjee now has a fresh opportunity to play guardian angel  to victims of trafficking ferried on trains.        
	The women and child development ministry is seeking Mamatas help to strengthen surveillance at railway junctions identified as crucial transit points in trafficking women and children, top government officials told The Telegraph.        
	Women and child development minister Krishna Tirath has already held talks with railway minister Mamata seeking collaboration, and sources close to both ministers confirmed that the conversation was very positive.        
	For Mamata, chief of the Trinamul Congress, the proposal presents an opportunity to highlight her stated commitment to concerns of women, a critical segment for her during elections.        
	I think she will be keen to do whatever is possible for the railways to assist in curbing trafficking. The minister would see this as a priority issue, a close Mamata aide said.        
	Any success in curbing trafficking will also help Tirath counter critics who argue she has done little in her ministry since taking over from Renuka Chowdhury after the Lok Sabha elections.        
	There are no official government figures on the number of victims of human trafficking annually, but NGOs and studies have suggested that over 20 million women and children, many of them from Bengal, are affected by the crime in India.        
	The railways have routinely been cited by academic studies and police investigations as the single largest transport medium used to traffic women and children from poor rural backgrounds to cities.         
	The women are forced into prostitution or made to work as household help, while the children are often employed in industries like zari trade that require nimble hands.        
	The Immoral Trafficking Prevention Act bans human trade and the child labour law bans employing children below 14 in homes, but repeated studies have shown that trafficking of women and children continues unabated.        
	This move to involve the railways in curbing trafficking is much needed. We welcome this initiative, Shantha Sinha, chairperson of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, said.        
	The women and child development ministry wants to involve stationmasters to set up child welfare committees at high-traffic railway stations, sources said.        
	Dedicated railway police teams and trained NGO activists will be used to spot groups of travellers potentially transporting trafficked victims.              
	Such groups of travellers may typically consist of a couple of grown-up individuals leading many children or girls betraying either hesitation or fear, past police operations have shown.        
	We plan to train the railway police and NGO activists in spotting potential trafficking victims, said a retired police officer now assisting the women and child development ministry.         
	If the victims are children, they will be taken to child welfare committees which will make arrangements to send them back to their parents.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Baalu amp; Raja, tied by controversy
                                                                                                               Baalu amp; Raja, tied by controversy
          G.C. SHEKHAR                              
	Chennai, May 22: As personalities go, the two men at the centre of the DMKs berth standoff are strikingly different.        
	T.R. Baalu, 68, is tall, well-built and brazen, known to tick off officials openly and has been the DMKs go-getter in Delhi.         
	The diminutive 46-year-old A. Raja is soft-spoken, wears his Dalit origin heavily on his small shoulders and appears to lack in confidence. So much so that he reportedly consults the party leadership before taking any major decision in his ministry and is seen as a below par performer.        
	But a scent of controversy had swirled around the ministries held by the duo. While Baalu held shipping, road transport and highways, Raja was in charge of communications and information technology.        
	When Raja, a lawyer, was in charge, the communications ministry was accused of squandering away over Rs 25,000 crore as licence money which the government would have earned had it auctioned the 2G spectrum during his tenure from May 2007. Instead, the ministry gave it away on a first-come-first-get basis with the sale window opened for a brief two hours.         
	Though Raja denied involvement, questions were raised by the finance ministry on the loss to the exchequer.         
	This was also the time when the Maran brothers, Dayanidhi and Kalanidhi, had fallen out with the Karunanidhi family. The Maran-owned Sun TV and Dinakaran daily launched a strident campaign against the alleged spectrum scam. The moment the brothers patched up with M. Karunanidhi, the DMK chief declared the spectrum scam a closed chapter.        
	Baalu, as minister of shipping, road transport and highways, had bulldozed the Centre into sanctioning the Rs 21,000-crore Sethusamudram Shipping Canal Project and went ahead in spite of opposition from fishermen and environmentalists.         
	Though experts dubbed it unviable, Baalu, before being halted by a Supreme Court stay, pushed ahead. The project involved lucrative dredging contracts. The Congress has probably discovered that the project is not viable and would only bleed public money by way of dredging contracts, said a senior official of the project.        
	The Prime Ministers Office and Congress leaders also blamed Baalu for the slowdown in the highway projects. In December 2008, Delhi High Court had slammed the ministry of highways for changing the chairperson of National Highways Authority of India far too frequently  five in two-and-a-half years  and also interfering in its functioning.

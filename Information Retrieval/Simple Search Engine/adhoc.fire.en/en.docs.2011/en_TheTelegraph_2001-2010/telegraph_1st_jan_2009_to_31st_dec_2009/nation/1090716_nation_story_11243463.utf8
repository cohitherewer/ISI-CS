The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Hillary date with Mumbai
                                                                                                               Hillary date with Mumbai
          JAYANTH JACOB                          Hillary Clinton. (AFP)                                  
	New Delhi, July 15: When Hillary Clinton touches down in Mumbai this Friday, it would be time for her to remember and take forward.        
	In other words, remember the victims of the Mumbai massacre and advance India-US ties that she had said last month were due for an upgrade.        
	In between, the US secretary of state would squeeze in a visit to a university and a college and meet representatives of Bollywood and Young India.        
	She is keen on knowing more about the growing, changing and Young India. So there were instructions that she gets a chance to meet those representing these ideals, said a source.        
	In perhaps a symbolic gesture, Clintons place of stay in Mumbai will be the Tata groups Taj Hotel, one of the targets of the November attack that forced her predecessor Condoleezza Rice to make an unscheduled visit last year.        
	Sources said Tata group boss Ratan Tata would host a reception where Clinton would meet young Indian entrepreneurs, especially women.        
	She would also meet actor Aamir Khan and volunteers of the Self-Employed Womens Association (SEWA), an NGO. Her five-day trip includes visits to Delhi University and Mumbais St Xaviers College, too.        
	The sources said efforts were on to arrange meetings with young parliamentarians but details of all the programmes, except the official meetings, were being kept under wraps because of security reasons.         
	On the business front, the visit is set to take the nuclear deal forward with the likely announcement of two US nuclear parks in Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat.         
	The visit, the sources said, will focus on ushering in Phase III of Washingtons strategic partnership with Delhi, which Clinton recently described as US-India 3.0, borrowing an analogy from the world of information technology.        
	The first concrete move in re-starting nuclear trade since the two countries signed the landmark agreement last year is expected to take off during Clintons visit, with India readying to provide two sites for nuclear reactors to be set up by US companies.         
	Clinton will fly to Delhi on Sunday. She will attend a meet on climate change and interact with scientists researching on agriculture at Pusa Institute.         
	She will meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, external affairs minister S.M. Krishna, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee and leader of Opposition L.K. Advani on Monday.        
	The sources said she would do the groundwork for a possible trip by Singh to America, after which President Barack Obama will visit India.        
	She will fly to Thailand on Tuesday to attend a meeting of foreign ministers of Southeast Asian countries in Phuket.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | In souths Kashi, deluge vs divinity   People safe, not heritage
                                                                                                               In souths Kashi, deluge vs divinity   People safe, not heritage
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                                                  
	Alampur, Oct. 10: When the deluge struck, Shiva, the god of destruction, saved his people at the cost of his own abode.        
	Alampur town, known as Dakshin Kashi (Varanasi of the south), is witnessing the longest flood of all in the state, with historians and art lovers worried about its clusters of centuries-old Shiva temples and 1,200-year-old shrine to Brahma.        
	Yet all the towns 20,000 residents are safe, despite 16ft-plus water levels reaching up to the first floors as early as October 1, at least 12 hours before other places were flooded.        
	The Kurnool district administration had acted almost with third-eye foresight and swiftly evacuated the entire town, 200km from Hyderabad and 25km from Kurnool, before the river Tungabhadra had surged in.        
	But with the residents out of harms way, the pilgrimage centre faded out of the governments focus. By Thursday, when the floodwaters had receded from most other towns and villages, Alampur was still under 3-4ft of water, with stinking carcasses of pigs, goats, chicken, cattle, dogs, snakes and fish floating everywhere.        
	This evening, the water level was at least a foot, and the streets were covered in a layer of slush.        
	Of more concern to devotees, tourists, architecture buffs and historians is the state of the Shiva shrines and the nine-temple Navabrahma complex made of red sandstone, one of the countrys two major shrines to the lord of creation (the other being at Ujjain).        
	Ironically, one reason for the continuing water-logging is the towns 16ft-high protective wall along the Tungabhadra, built to prevent flooding. The river had surged above the wall on October 1; later, the wall prevented the waters from receding.        
	The wall not only did not prevent flooding; it did not facilitate the natural draining of water for four days, said a dejected Purushottam Rao, who sells mementoes to tourists. The deluge has destroyed his ware.        
	With no support available from the district administration, anxious townsfolk came in boats and breached the wall on Tuesday to let the water out. Still, this correspondent saw dirty, waist-deep water on the roads and inside homes in the town on Thursday.        
	The officials brought half-a-dozen pump sets on Wednesday to drain the remaining water out, but the silt and slush made the pumps defunct, said local MP Suryaprakash Reddy. It will be at least Monday before the water drains out completely, officials said.        
	The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has sent a team to check the damage to the Navabrahma complex, built in the eighth and ninth centuries by the Chalukya rulers of Karnataka.        
	Alampur also has a sandstone Shiva temple, which the ASI had spent two years transplanting brick by brick from the place where the Tungabhadra flows into the Krishna.        
	The ASI is likely to shut the temples down for at least a month for repairs. We have to make sure the structures are safe, else even a vibration might bring them down, an ASI official said in Hyderabad.        
	Residents are aghast. Tourism gives us our daily bread, said Bhaskar, a guide.

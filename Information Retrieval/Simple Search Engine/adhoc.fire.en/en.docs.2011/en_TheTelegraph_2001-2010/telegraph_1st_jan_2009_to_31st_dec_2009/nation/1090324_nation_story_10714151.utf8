          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 23: The state has ordered a judicial probe into yesterdays mob violence and police firing at Bhuban in Dhenkanal district and suspended the inspector in-charge of the police station.         
	One person was killed and several others were seriously injured yesterday in a clash between the police and residents who were protesting against the death of Class X student Bimalendu Nayak.         
	Official sources said a district judge would conduct the probe ordered by chief minister Naveen Patnaik. An ex-gratia assistance of Rs 1 lakh has been sanctioned from the chief ministers relief fund.         
	The boys relatives accused the police for calling the murder an unnatural death. After Nayaks body was found near a pond in Badapokhari on Friday, residents hit the roads on Sunday demanding the arrest of those accused.         
	Crowds ransacked the police station and torched vehicles. The police retaliated with lathicharge but that did not work. We were forced to open fire, said Dhenkanal superintendent of police S.K. Gajbhiye.        
	Residents, who had blocked the NH-200 till late last evening, removed the blockade only after a compensation of Rs 100,000 was announced.         
	Shops were closed in Bhuban town today in protest.

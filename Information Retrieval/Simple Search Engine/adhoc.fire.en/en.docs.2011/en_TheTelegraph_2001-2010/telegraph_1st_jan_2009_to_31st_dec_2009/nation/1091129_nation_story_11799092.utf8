The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | India plan to cut emissions by up to 38%

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                           
	New Delhi, Nov. 28: Indias proposed actions on climate change could mean up to 38 per cent lower amounts of carbon emissions by 2020 than its likely emissions without actions, a new non-government assessment has suggested.         
	Plans to expand solar energy applications, improve energy efficiency in households and industry, and promote public transport  if implemented  could mean 12 per cent to 38 per cent lower emissions from business-as-usual (no-action) emissions by 2020, environmental organisation Greenpeace has computed. It has shared the assessment with members of Indian negotiators in climate change talks.         
	The actual deviation of emissions from business-as-usual would depend on which of the proposed actions are actually implemented by India and how much funding would be available, officials and climate change analysts have said.         
	India has pledged several unilateral domestic actions on climate change  a programme to expand installed solar energy capacity to 20,000MW by 2022, mandatory fuel-efficiency standards for all cars by 2011, building public transport systems in cities and improving energy efficiency by coaxing industries as well as households towards more efficient processes and appliances.         
	The least expensive option addressing only energy efficiency could lead to emissions deviations of 12 per cent to 18 per cent, said Siddharth Pathak, a climate policy officer with Greenpeace.         
	The higher the investments and the greater the expansion of renewable energy applications, the greater will be the potential to lower emissions growth, he said.         
	Ahead of crucial UN climate change talks to be held in Copenhagen next month, India has been under intense pressure to quantify how its climate change actions will alter its pattern of carbon dioxide emissions in the coming years.         
	The talks are aimed at finalising strategies to reduce emissions for the period beyond 2012 on the basis of common but differentiated responsibilities  which recognises industrialised countries as primarily responsible for current emissions loads.         
	The negotiations are intended to lead to legally-binding emissions reduction targets for industrialised countries and voluntary, non-binding domestic plans to reduce growth of emissions by developing countries such as India, China and Brazil.         
	Analysts believe India can achieve significant emissions deviations and energy savings through action on electricity which alone accounts for 58 per cent of the countrys total greenhouse gas emissions.         
	A major action that could contribute to lower electricity use would be a switch to efficient refrigerators, air conditioners and heaters. While Indias Bureau of Energy Efficiency has already introduced a voluntary star-rating scheme that rates such appliances according to their efficiency, consumers still have the option of buying relatively cheaper low efficiency products.         
	A mandatory phase out of appliances below a cut-off efficiency limit by 2012 could contribute a lot, Pathak said. Another action would be to support the replacement of 400 million bulbs nationwide with compact fluorescent lamps by 2012, he said.         
	Earlier this week, the Indian government had indicated that the pace of growth of its proposed 20,000MW solar energy by 2022 would depend on availability of funding from international sources.

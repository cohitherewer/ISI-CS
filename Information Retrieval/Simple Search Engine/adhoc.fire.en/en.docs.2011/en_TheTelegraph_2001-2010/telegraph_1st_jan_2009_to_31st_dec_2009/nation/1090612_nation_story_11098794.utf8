The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lebanese angle to Australia attacks
                                                                                                               Lebanese angle to Australia attacks
                            
	Melbourne, June 11 (PTI): Indian students held protests for the third consecutive night in Sydney yesterday and accused Lebanese youths of being behind several of the recent racist attacks.        
	The demonstrations were held despite appeals from Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and community members to stop the gatherings and self-defence patrols. The protesters said police were ignoring their pleas for protection.        
	As the street marches continued, a local council in the Sydney area that has seen days of demonstrations claimed that the students had agreed to stop the protests.         
	The Parramatta city council made the announcement after a meeting with the police, Indias consul general and members of the Indian community. Yadu Singh, co-ordinator of the consul generals committee on Indian students issues, said the meeting had ended with calls to wind up the protests.         
	The rallies have served their purpose and we dont want any more rallies in Harris Park (part of Parramatta). That is the communitys view, Singh said, adding that the gatherings were disrupting normal life of the people. Singh said the students at the meeting had agreed to pass on the request to other protesters.        
	The Lebanese community didnt deny the charges levelled at them by the Indian students but said it was unfair to target everyone because of one bad person.        
	Rudd said yesterday that while violence in Australian cities was a regrettable part of urban life, vigilante action was equally unwelcome.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sparkle of hope in Surat diamond hub
                                                                                                               Sparkle of hope in Surat diamond hub
          BASANT RAWAT                               
	Ahmedabad, Aug. 28: The sparkle is returning to the downturn-hit diamond hub of Surat.        
	The industry, the worlds largest for diamond processing, took a severe beating following the global meltdown which started last year. Demand from the US  which accounted for 60 per cent of the Rs 80,000-crore export market  and Europe, reduced to a trickle, forcing several units in Surat to go bust.        
	The worst, now, appears to be over, with the industry tapping other markets such as West Asia and China for sustenance.         
	Business is still not as usual as it used to be but the situation has improved over the last two months. Exports are gradually picking up, said Chandrakant Sanghvi, regional chairman of the Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council.         
	Surat Diamond Association president Rohit Mehta said production had increased and so had exports. Not to the traditional markets (the US and Europe), which still havent recovered, but to West Asia and China. The stockpile lying with many diamond polishers has been liquidated, he said.         
	The diamond and jewellery sector of the Surat special economic zone recorded exports of Rs 1,975 crore for July this year as against last years figure of Rs 1,255 crore.         
	Industry sources admitted that the road ahead was still long, but pointed out that the figures did not reflect the complete story: one of relief that the tide was now turning, albeit slowly.         
	The industry has passed through its worst phase and the nightmare is behind us, Mehta said, summing up the upbeat mood.        
	Agreed Sanghvi, who said he hoped the industry would get back to its previous levels in another six months.        
	An indication of this newfound euphoria is that the industry, which had laid off thousands of diamond cutters and polishers, has begun hiring afresh and is looking for skilled manpower.         
	Abubhai Jariwala, president, Surat Diamond Workers Union, said: There are vacancies in every unit in Surat.         
	Over two lakh of the eight lakh workers engaged in the industry didnt return after going home for the Diwali holidays last year, turning to the textile industry and agriculture for jobs.         
	The shortage of skilled manpower had been hurting the industry. But, argued Mehta, it was good for the long-term revival of the industry since a shortage of workers would lead to controlled production, which would be beneficial in the changing market where the demand is less.        
	Mehta said it was important that the industry created new markets. We should not be dependent on the US and Europe, he said.

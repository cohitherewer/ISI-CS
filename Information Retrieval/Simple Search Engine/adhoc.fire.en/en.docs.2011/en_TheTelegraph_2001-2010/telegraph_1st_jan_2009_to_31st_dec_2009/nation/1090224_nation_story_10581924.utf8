                                                                                                               Centre clears genomics institute in Kalyani
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 23: The Union cabinet today approved a proposal to establish an institute in Bengals Kalyani that would launch Indias first large-scale programme for screening newborns for genetic disorders and spearhead the countrys efforts in the global cancer genome consortium.         
	The National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, to be funded by the biotechnology department, will have a budget of Rs 210 crore for the next three years.         
	Sources said the institute would begin functioning later this year and eventually have a staff of around 100 scientists.         
	 The institute will lead Indias contribution to the International Cancer Genome Consortium, biotechnology secretary M.K. Bhan said.        
	 The cancer genome initiative is aimed at creating a catalogue of genetic mutations associated with cancer at different sites in the body. The institute will collaborate with medical colleges and hospitals across eastern and northeastern India to jointly develop genomics research.        
	Indias role is to look at the genomics of oral cancer. The cancer genome initiative is expected to improve our ability to classify tumours, improve the efficiency of cancer diagnosis and design more rational therapy for individual patients, a source said.         
	Another planned project would be large-scale screening of newborn children for a variety of genetic disorders in collaborative programmes with local medical colleges. We dont have reliable statistics yet about the prevalence of some genetic disorders, a scientist said.

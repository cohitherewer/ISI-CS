                                                                                                               Pension gift to security forces 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, May 19: The paramilitary forces have been exempted from a pension scheme that would have required personnel to contribute to the fund from their salary.         
	The forces were against the scheme. The finance and home ministries argued over this for more than a year before a decision was taken last week  perhaps a parting gift by the outgoing Congress-led regime that has come back to power.         
	BSF director-general M.L. Kumawat today announced the good news for the paramilitary forces. I am pleased to announce that the government has accepted our demand of restoring the old pension scheme. Now, everyone in the forces will get the pension, PTI quoted him as saying.        
	The pension scheme, effective from January 1, 2004, marked a shift from the defined benefit regime where the government contributed to the pension fund. Under the new scheme, those who wanted a pension after retirement had to contribute from their salary every month. All government employees, other than the three defence forces, were brought under the scheme.        
	In 2007, the home ministry proposed that the paramilitary be exempted as they had a high-risk job profile but the finance ministry resisted it. The home ministry argued that the paramilitary forces were covered by the armed forces act, so their benefits should be the same as the defence forces.         
	About 8 lakh personnel from the CRPF, BSF, CISF, SSB and the ITBP will benefit from the exemption.

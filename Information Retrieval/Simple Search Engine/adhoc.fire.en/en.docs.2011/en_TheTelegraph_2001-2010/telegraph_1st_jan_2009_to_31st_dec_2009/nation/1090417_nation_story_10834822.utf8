The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Karat on front
                                                                                                               Karat on front
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, April 16: CPM boss Prakash Karat has iterated that the general election is a three-way contest.        
	In an article in the CPM mouthpiece Peoples Democracy, Karat said the gathering of forces by the Left and its regional allies had unnerved the BJP and the Congress.         
	Contrary to what the Congress and the BJP hoped would be a contest between the two parties and their respective allies, the coming together of the non-Congress, non-BJP parties are challenging both the Congress and the BJP in a number of states. This is behind the increasing attacks on the third front by the Congress and the BJP leadership, the article said.         
	Karat ridiculed Congress and BJP claims that the third front had no potential. If such a front is only an illusion or just a motley bunch of parties without a programme, why are the two parties so worried?

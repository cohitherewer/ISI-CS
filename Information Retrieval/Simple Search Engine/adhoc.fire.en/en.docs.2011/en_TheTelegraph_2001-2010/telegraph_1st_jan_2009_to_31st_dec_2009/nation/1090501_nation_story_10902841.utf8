	New Delhi, April 30 (PTI): The CBI, which had asked Interpol to drop Italian businessman Ottavio Quattrocchis name from the list of most-wanted persons, today sought two months time from a Delhi court to decide on further action to be taken against the Bofors case accused.        
	The CBI is considering various options available to it in consultation with the government, additional solicitor-general P.P. Malhotra said.        
	During the hearing before chief metropolitan magistrate Kaveri Baweja, Malhotra and Naveen Kumar Matta, appearing for the CBI, sought two months to file a status report in the case.        
	The court asked Malhotra what options were left with the prosecution against the 70-year-old Quattrocchi to which the additional solicitor-general did not give a direct reply.         
	There were eight accused in the case. Three are already dead, four were acquitted by Delhi High Court in February 2004. Various attempts to get Quattrocchi extradited to India have failed, Malhotra said.        
	The matter is under active consideration of the CBI and the central government. It is submitted that it would take about two months to enable the CBI to place the next status report in the matter, he said.        
	The court adjourned the matter for September 8.        
	The CBI also said it had hired the best counsel and spent huge sums of money to bring back Quattrocchi, Malhotra said.

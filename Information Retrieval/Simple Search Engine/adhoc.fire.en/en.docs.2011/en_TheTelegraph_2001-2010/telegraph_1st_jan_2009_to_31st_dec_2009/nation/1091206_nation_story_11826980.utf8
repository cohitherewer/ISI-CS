          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Dec. 5: The Opposition today stalled proceedings in the Orissa Assembly, pressing demands for a CBI probe into the multi-crore mining scam.        
	As the Speaker, Pradip Amat, ignored their plea, the angry Opposition members stormed the Well shouting slogans, tried to climb the Speakers podium and broke his microphone, forcing three adjournments till 3pm.        
	Raising the issue during the zero hour, Leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh said that according to newspaper reports none other than Naveen Patnaik had granted lease to 40 mines during his tenure as Union minister in the Vajpayee government.        
	These mines included Indrani Patnaik mines in Keonjhar, for which the ruling BJD legislators yesterday targeted the previous Congress government in the state, which had recommended the grant of lease.        
	Since Naveen was involved in the grant of mines lease, the vigilance could not function impartially, argued Singh.

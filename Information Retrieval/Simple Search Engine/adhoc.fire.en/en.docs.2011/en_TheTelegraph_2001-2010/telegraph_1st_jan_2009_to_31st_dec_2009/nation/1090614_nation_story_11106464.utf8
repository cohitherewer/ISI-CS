          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, June 13: A controversy is brewing over selection of books by the state for libraries of 3,500 high schools.        
	The Orissa High Court had ordered for formation of a rationalisation committee for re-selection of books after allegations of foul play two months ago. But a review petition has now challenged the order.         
	Initially, the government had constituted a committee with 295 books of 243 writers. The government had approved the list in August 2008 and empowered Odiya Bhasa Pratisthan, a government-run institute on Oriya language, to finalise the process. The institute was allocated Rs 1.40 crore for buying the books. Accordingly, the institute sought sample copies from the publishers of selected books in September, but did not place supply orders.        
	After six months, three of the publishers involved filed petitions in the high court seeking judicial intervention against possible change in the selected list. But on April 6, 2009, the court directed the state to constitute a rationalisation committee for re-selection of books after Odiya Bhasa Pratisthan pointed out that the earlier list had excluded books of many eminent writers.         
	A two-judge bench had suggested inclusion of names of noted writers  Pathani Patnaik, Mohapatra Nilamani Sahu, Satkadi Hota and Hara Prasad Das  in the committee. But the three publishers in their review petition questioned the inclusion of writers whose books were included in the list.

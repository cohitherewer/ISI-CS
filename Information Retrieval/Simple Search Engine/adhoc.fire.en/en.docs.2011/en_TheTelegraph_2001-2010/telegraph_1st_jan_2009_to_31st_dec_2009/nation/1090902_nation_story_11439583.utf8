The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cong, NCP set for joint fight
                                                                                                               Cong, NCP set for joint fight
  - Partners tied by seat compulsions itch to cut each other to size        SANJAY K. JHA                            Sonia, Pawar: Time to shake hands                                       
	New Delhi, Sept. 1: The Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party are set to fight the Maharashtra elections together.        
	Congress leaders conceded in private conversations that the alliance was a foregone conclusion and that they were mounting pressure on Sharad Pawar to extract a better bargain while working out the share of seats.        
	The intermittent go-alone cry, they said, was part of the coercive politics that the Congress leadership plays against Pawar despite the underlying belief that alliance with his NCP is necessary.        
	The NCP contested 121 of the 288 seats in the last elections but the Congress is not willing to spare more than 100 this time. Around 22 seats have become favourable to the Congress after delimitation and the NCP must return those to us, a senior leader told The Telegraph.        
	Congress sources said the party believed the NCP had weakened considerably and it should adjust to the new realities without much fuss.        
	If this years general election is taken as the benchmark, the charge of the NCPs decline becomes irrefutable. The Congress won 17 of the 48 Lok Sabha seats in the state while the NCP managed just eight.         
	It is at the bottom of the table after the Shiv Sena (11) and the BJP (9), a clear slump from the last Assembly election when it emerged as the largest party.        
	Statistics apart, there are several other reasons for the ongoing war of nerves between the antagonistic partners.         
	A section of the Congress has always been suspicious of Pawar and it now wants to pin him down sensing his political vulnerability.        
	The recent attack on Pawar by Congress leader Satyavrat Chaturvedi for the mess in the agriculture ministry and poor price management has not been disapproved of by his party.        
	The same leader had been punished for speaking against Samajwadi Party general secretary Amar Singh in the past.        
	Pawar had flirted with the third front by joining a rally in Orissa and even kept his channels open with the Left, arguing that a UPA government was unthinkable without Left support. The election results altered the political equations and Pawar is now completely dependent on the Congress for a role in national politics.        
	Pawarsaheb may be the BCCI (cricket board) boss but he is a chess player, a Congress leader explained. The chessboard has been thrown away by voters.        
	Congress leader Digvijay Singhs repeated invite for a merger has also created confusion in NCP ranks. The CBI crackdown on NCP MP Padamsinh Patil for alleged murder and Congress non-cooperation that forced the last Indian Premier League cricket tournament out of India are other indicators of Pawars diminishing clout.        
	Former chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, who suspects Pawars hand in his ouster from office, has added to the confusion by openly demanding separation from the NCP.        
	But the last municipal elections in Mumbai have taught the Congress a lesson. The Sena won, despite being in disarray after the exit of Raj Thackeray and Narayan Rane, because the Congress and the NCP fought separately.         
	The Congresss assessment is that it can win 100 seats on its own, but that will be well short of the halfway mark of 144. So, the alliance is necessary.         
	The committee formed by Sonia Gandhi after the Lok Sabha elections to examine the viability of going alone has also suggested alliance.        
	But the Congress sees Pawars hand in the formation of the 16-party third front, which has threatened to contest all the seats in the coming elections. Hence the party has adopted delaying tactics to give minimum time to Pawar to plan the sabotage of its prospects.        
	It is truly ironic that both the partners are itching to cut the other down to size and still be good enough to form the government together.

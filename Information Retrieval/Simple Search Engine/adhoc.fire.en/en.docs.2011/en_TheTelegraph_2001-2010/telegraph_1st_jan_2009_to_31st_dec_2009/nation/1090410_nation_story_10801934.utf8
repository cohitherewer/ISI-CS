The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Diktat from CEO: 50 seats or face music
                                                                                                               Diktat from CEO: 50 seats or face music
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                            
	The number 50 is giving sleepless nights to the babus who run Mayavatis administration.        
	The Bahujan Samaj Party chief has decided she must get 50 Lok Sabha seats out of Uttar Pradeshs 80. Anything less and heads could roll at the secretariat that the chief minister runs like a CEO.        
	A year ago, the officials thought the target was easily achievable when Prakash Karat and A.B. Bardhan began packaging Mayavati as prospective Prime Minister. Her political advisers in the BSP said she would touch 55.        
	But now the bureaucrats are not so sure. Estimates range from 30 to 40, but no ones talking of even 41, let alone 50. That would still be far higher than the 19 Mayavati got in 2004. But the babus fear that anything less than 50 could put their jobs in jeopardy because, as one of them said: She rules like the CEO of a corporate conglomerate. Mid-term appraisals and performance variables are the staple of her style.        
	The bureaucrats say the biggest reason the target may not be achieved is that anti-incumbency has caught up fast. The delivery mechanisms are not in place, cadres aspirations have touched the roof and when they dont get what they want, they sulk or revolt, an official said.        
	The celebrated social coalition of Brahmins, Dalits, some backward castes and, to an extent, Muslims that made her chief minister in 2007 no longer holds.        
	The Dalits complain that Brahmins have got a larger share of the pie while the Brahmins say only one family is walking away with the largesse  a reference to Mayavatis political adviser, Satish Chandra Mishra. He recently got land allotted for a college named after his mother in a prime Lucknow spot.        
	Mayavati gets both party and government to monitor rivals meetings. She asks for the turnout, especially when it is a Samajwadi Party rally. She compares the official data with inputs from the party, which has been broken into units down to the village level, and seeks explanations from both if theres a wide gulf.        
	An official said: If theres a conflict of perceptions on an issue, she mulls over it for a couple of days and then gives her verdict. After that, nothing can change her mind.        
	For instance, she didnt react immediately after Varun Gandhis alleged anti-Muslim speech in Pilibhit. Local BSP leaders had advised against saying anything lest that consolidate Hindu votes.        
	But when the babus learnt of a BJP plan to raise jathas (armies) of 100-plus cadres in every district to propagate Varuns message, they advised Mayavati to invoke the National Security Act.        
	The governments feedback is that while Varun is certainly winning Pilibhit, his effect in other parts has been contained.         
	The NSA move has softened the Muslims towards the BSP but not enough to give us a cutting edge, an official said.        
	If a purge follows the poll results, the word is that Mishra will survive because he is too useful in handling her court cases but not his handpicked Brahmin bureaucrats. Ministers would be soft targets, especially Naseemuddin, who was tasked to woo Muslims. Mayavatis loyal Dalit officials are expected to remain untouched.

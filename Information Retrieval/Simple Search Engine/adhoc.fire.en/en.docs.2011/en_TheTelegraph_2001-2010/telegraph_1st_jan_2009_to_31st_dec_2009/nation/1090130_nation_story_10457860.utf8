                                                                                                               Chargesheet over nun rape
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Kandhamal, post-Christmas                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 29: The criminal investigation department of Orissa police today filed a chargesheet against 10 accused in the Kandhamal nun rape case at a district trial court.         
	Talking to The Telegraph, inspector-general of police (crime branch) Arun Roy said the chargesheet was filed at the court of Baliguda SDJM in Kandhamal within the stipulated 120 days of the first arrests. The police had arrested four men on October 2, 2008.         
	The CID had taken over the investigation on October 3 following media reports on the local polices inordinate delay in the investigations. It was reported that the police had collected medical reports after more than a month of the rape. Roy said the crime branch, investigating the rape, had charged 10 men, who have been arrested. Besides, the branch is likely to submit a petition in the court seeking a warrant to arrest another 50, who were a part of the mob that assaulted the 29-year-old woman at K-Nuagaon on August 25. We will file a supplementary chargesheet later after their arrest, said investigating officer Dillip Kumar Mohanty.         
	Those who were chargesheeted include one Jhuria Pradhan and his son Kartik, Saroj Bhadei and son Muna, brothers Tapas Patnaik and Mitu Patnaik, Biren Sahu, Somnath Pradhan, Gajendra Digal and Jharalal Behera. Three of the 10 were arrested from Kerala. Of them, main accused Santosh Patnaik, alias Mitu, and accomplice Kartik Pradhan, were identified by the victim during a test identification parade held at Choudwar circle jail on January 5. Santosh has been charged under Section 376 of the IPC, while others have been charged mainly under Sections 323 and 324. With the chargesheets filed, the process of framing charges and a trial will follow. Filing was delayed due to the victims reluctance to attend the TI parade.        
	Acting on her petition, the high court had ordered for the TI parade to be conducted at Choudwar circle jail near Cuttack.

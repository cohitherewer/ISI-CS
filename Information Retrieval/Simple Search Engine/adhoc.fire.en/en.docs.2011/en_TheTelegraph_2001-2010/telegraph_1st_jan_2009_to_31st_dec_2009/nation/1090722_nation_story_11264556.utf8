          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, July 21: With rain pouring over the upper catchment areas of the Mahanadi and with the release of floodwater from the Hirakud, the situation in the delta region spread across six coastal districts has officials concerned.        
	Flood managers are virtually on their toes because lakhs of lives are dependent on the river. The Mahanadi delta has a network of 3,924km of river embankments around the Mahanadi, Luna, Chitrotpala, Kathajodi, Daya, Bhargavi, Kushabhadra and Devi spread over Cuttack, Kendrapada, Jagatsinghpur, Puri, Khurda and Nayagarh.        
	With one sluice gate of the Hirakud dam near Sambalpur open and the Naraj delta head near Cuttack city receiving 9.5 lakh cusecs today, with more than 2 lakh cusecs to follow, the concern is if the network embankments downstream will be able to contain the water. There seems to be a tacit assumption that the government may just about tide over the crisis and manage to avert a major flood situation.         
	The new moon tomorrow will be very vital as the draining of floodwater is normally very low during such period. Much will depend on it before the next quantum of floodwater passes through the Naraj delta head, said minister for revenue and disaster management Surya Marayan Patro.        
	The next 24 hours will require close monitoring. Collectors have been asked to remain on a high alert, Patro added. The network criss-crossing the delta have a capacity to contain 9-9.5 lakh cusecs, but if it is more, then inundation is imminent, said an official at the water resources department.         
	According to latest recordings at Naraj, the Mahanadi was running at 25.58m (against a warning level of 25.41m) and approaching the danger level at 26.41m.        
	The level at Hirakud dam stood at 607.19ft against its maximum capacity of 630ft and one of the sluice gates had been opened.

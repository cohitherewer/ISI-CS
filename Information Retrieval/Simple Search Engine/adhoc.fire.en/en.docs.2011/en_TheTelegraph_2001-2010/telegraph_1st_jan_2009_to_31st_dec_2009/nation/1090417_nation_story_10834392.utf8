	Bhubaneswar, April 16: The first phase of polling for 10 Lok Sabha and 70 Assembly seats in southern and western Orissa, was marred by rebel attacks, loot of electronic voting machines (EVMs) and political clashes. However, no casualty was reported.         
	Talking to The Telegraph, deputy-general of police Manmohan Praharaj said Naxalites set fire to polling booths and destroyed several EVMs in Malkangiri, looting machines from a Sundergarh polling station. Polling was, however, safely conducted despite the violence, said the police chief. Inspector-general (law and order), Arun Sarangi confirmed the incidents.         
	Rebels attacked Andrahal polling station in Chitrakonda area, torched a vehicle on election duty and two EVMs, after taking polling staff hostage, Malkangiri collector Nitin Bhanudas Jawle said, adding that voting was halted in the booth. The staff were later released.        
	Two more booths and EVMs were torched in Salimarikonda and MV-73 under Kalimela police station area, said Malkangiri superintendent of police Satyabrata Bhoi. At Gamphakonda and Baphanapalli in Malkangiri more machines were damaged by Maoists. At Mahulpada in Malkangiri, rebels attacked a company of CRPF personnel leading to an exchange of fire for several hours. However, no casualty was reported and the gun battle was followed by a flag march.         
	A political clash was reported in Ganjam where supporters of Congress and BJD clashed at Gobara village under Bhanjanagar Assembly constituency over the distribution of slips leading to blank firing from both sides. However, the men were chased away by the police and polling was continued peacefully afterwards, said Ganjam SP Nitenjit Singh.         
	A similar clash took place at a booth in Polsara Assembly constituency, where polling was suspended for some time as the EVMs were damaged during the clash. Voting resumed around 1.30pm after new machines replaced the damaged ones.         
	Kandhamal peaceful        
	Despite all fears, more than 55 per cent voters exercised their franchise in communally-sensitive Kandhamal amid tight security.        
	Talking to The Telegraph over phone Kandhamal collector Krishan Kumar said the turnout was more than 55 percent and the polling passed off absolutely peacefully.         
	Ninety percent of inmates in the five relief camps also exercised their franchise. At present, over 3,500 riot victims are living in five relief camps across the district. Of them, 2,048 are voters, official sources said.         
	There was lurking fear among inmates and Christian families, who returned home after August-September riots that claimed 38 lives, that there would be a rerun of communal violence during the polls. BJP had made the murder of VHP leader Swami Laxmananda Saraswati and its aftermath as the major electoral issue, fuelling panic among Christians.         
	However, there was no report of any clashes from any part of the district.

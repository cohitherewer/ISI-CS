                                                                                                               PM allays de-link fears
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT       
	New Delhi, July 17: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today clarified in both Houses of Parliament that any meaningful dialogue with Pakistan could start only if Islamabad stopped letting terrorists target India from its soil.        
	Yesterdays joint Indo-Pak statement in Egypt, after talks between Singh and Pakistan Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani, had spoken of de-linking terrorism from the composite dialogue process. The Opposition parties saw in it a dilution of Indias stand on cross-border terror  a view Singh today tried to rebut.        
	It has been and remains our consistent position that the starting point of any meaningful dialogue with Pakistan is a fulfilment of their commitment, in letter and spirit, not to allow their territory to be used in any manner for terrorist activities against India, he said.        
	In both Houses, Singhs assertion was part of his written statement on his visit to Italy, France and Egypt. In the Rajya Sabha, he reaffirmed his point when leader of the Opposition Arun Jaitley sought a clarification.        
	Singh said that the time, place and form of dialogue with Pakistan would depend on future developments and underlined that India was willing to go more than halfway provided Pakistan creates the conditions for a meaningful dialogue.        
	For the present, we have agreed that the foreign secretaries will meet as often as necessary and report to the two foreign ministers who will meet on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly, he said.        
	As the joint statement says, action on terrorism should not be linked to the composite dialogue process, and therefore cannot await other developments. It was agreed that the two countries will share real-time, credible and actionable information on any future terrorist threats.        
	BJP walkout        
	In the Lok Sabha, the BJP walked out accusing the government of capitulating to Pakistan and threatening to agitate inside and outside Parliament.        
	Leader of the Opposition L.K. Advani and his deputy Sushma Swaraj wanted to seek clarifications from Singh after he had finished reading out his statement. But leader of the House Pranab Mukherjee said Lok Sabha rules  unlike those of the Rajya Sabha  didnt allow questions on such a statement.        
	Mukherjee said the Opposition could ask for a structured debate on the subject. Advani agreed to that but insisted on a clarification, and eventually led the walkout.        
	Sushma later told a news conference the BJP had submitted a notice for a debate. Asked if India had buckled before US pressure, she agreed and said the BJP would raise the subject of external pressure at the Parliament debate.

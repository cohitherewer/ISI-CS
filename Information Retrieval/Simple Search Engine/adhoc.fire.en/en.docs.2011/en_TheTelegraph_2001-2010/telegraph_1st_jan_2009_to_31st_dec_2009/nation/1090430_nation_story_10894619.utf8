          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, April 29: BJD leaders and activists today staged a silent dharna near the Assembly protesting against the discriminatory and prejudiced attitude of the states chief electoral officer.         
	Putting a piece of green cloth, leaders and activists sat on a silent dharna.         
	Talking to The Telegraph, the state convenor of BJDs youth wing, Sanjay Dasburma, said his party had drawn the attention of the chief electoral officer to several cases of booth capturing and assault on leaders and workers by the Congress and BJP at several places including Patkura, Brahmagiri and Nayagarh constituencies.        
	However, the chief electoral officer did not take action against them, despite frequent requests, he alleged.         
	While the chief officer complied with demands of Congress and BJP candidates for repoll in some booths, she ignored similar pleas of BJD, said Dasburma, who contested from the Brahmagiri constituency.        
	Echoing Dasburma, sitting party MLA from Patkura, Atanu Sabyasachi Nayak alleged that the CEO had shut her ears to their complaints.        
	In a joint memorandum to the chief election commissioner, Dasburma and BJD student wing convenor Ranjit Mohapatra complained of discriminatory attitude of the officer towards BJD.

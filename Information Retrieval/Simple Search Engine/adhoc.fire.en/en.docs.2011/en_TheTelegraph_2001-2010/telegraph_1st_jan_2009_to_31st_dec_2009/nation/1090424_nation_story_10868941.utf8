The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Chauhan and Atal dwarf Advani
                                                                                                               Chauhan and Atal dwarf Advani
          JAYANTH JACOB IN VIDISHA, HOSHANGABAD                             Chauhan, Vajpayee                                 
	Lal Krishna Advani stares down from a few banners and hoardings but its the gift of Vajpayee that party workers are harping on.        
	And the leader who voters are warming to is not the BJPs man for Prime Minister but the heartland states CEO  chief minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan.        
	For the BJP, the Lok Sabha polls in Madhya Pradesh is turning out to be an extension of the 2008 Assembly elections the party won to retain power.        
	Party leaders mention terrorism and security, but in passing. The stress is on development.         
	Decisive government, determined leader  the BJPs campaign theme for the 2009 elections  seems to be no match for Abki bari Atal Bihari, the slogan of yore that struck an immediate chord with voters, party sources say.        
	In a state where the party has been re-elected on development, it is better to focus on it again, a senior BJP leader explains.        
	No wonder larger-than-life-size hoardings and banners that have Advanis pictures are few and far between.        
	The smooth road you have taken to reach here is the gift of Atal Bihari Vajpayee to us. Our chief minister is working day in and day out for the development of the state. This is the message we are taking to the people, says Akhilesh Khandelwal, the Hoshangabad district chief of the Yuva Morcha, the BJPs youth wing, before setting off again to hit the road for party candidate Rampal Singh.        
	Vajpayees name comes up again and again as BJP workers talk about the Golden Quadrilateral, the highway project launched by the former Prime Minister.        
	And the chief messenger of the development themes the party is highlighting is the states chief executive  Chauhan. He seems to have read the pulse.         
	We want power for better crop yields. We want better roads, too, says Gopu Garg, a farmer in a village 45km from Hoshangabad town, kick-starting his motorbike.         
	The chief minister seems to have also won over many woman voters. He comes across as someone who can bring development, and who will listen to us, says Archana Singh, a resident of Vidisha, some three-and-a-half-hours drive form Hoshangabad, where party leader Sushma Swaraj is the candidate.        
	Party workers talk of the simple way Chauhan delivers his message. He says he is a brother to the women, and a mama (uncle) to their daughters. So their wedding is his responsibility, says one.        
	He may not be talking about Hindutva, a university teacher points out. But his schemes evoke imageries associated with Hindu religion. He knows it will connect with the people. There is no one to match him.        
	Advani just stares down from banners and hoardings.

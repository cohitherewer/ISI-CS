                                                                                    Wednesday , November 11 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Cong slap for Raman rant
          SHEENA K                              
	Raipur, Nov. 10: Who lost the polls, chief minister Raman Singh or the official party candidate? The debate continues.        
	After all, during the campaign trail, Singh had announced that it was he and not the partys official candidate, Jageshwar Sahu, contesting from the prestigious Vaishali Nagar seat, 40km from Raipur.         
	The move was aimed to project Raman Singh as the tallest BJP leader in the state and use that to appeal to voters.         
	But, all ploys misfired on November 7 when the seat went to polls.         
	As the final votes were counted in the afternoon today, it became clear that the BJP candidate was pinned by his Congress colleague, Bhajansingh Nirankari.         
	Since (Raman) Singh claimed that he was contesting the election, and since the BJP candidate has lost, Singh has no right to remain as the chief minister, said the Chhattisgarh Pradesh Congress Committee chief Dhanendra Sahu while talking to The Telegraph.         
	He added that the Congress demanded the chief ministers resignation and that he quit without further delay.         
	Nirankari trounced Sahu by a margin of 1,228 votes. He bagged 47,225 votes while Sahu managed 45,997. This swing in favour of the Congress has taken the BJP poll managers by surprise, in less than a year.         
	Rifts within the BJP ranks helped Congress wrest the seat from the BJP, they feel. In the November 2008 Assembly polls, Vaishali Nagar, which came into existence after delimitation, elected BJPs Saroj Pandey by a huge margin of 22,000 votes.         
	Pandey quit after being elected to the Lok Sabha this year.

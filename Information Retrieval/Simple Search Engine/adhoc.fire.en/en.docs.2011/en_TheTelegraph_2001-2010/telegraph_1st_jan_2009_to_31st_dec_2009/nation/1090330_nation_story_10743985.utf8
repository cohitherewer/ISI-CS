The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | CPM heat on grand Desam alliance
                                                                                                               CPM heat on grand Desam alliance
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, March 29: The Opposition alliance in Andhra Pradesh today teetered on the brink after the CPM announced on its own that it would contest 50 Assembly and five Lok Sabha seats from the state.        
	CPM leaders said the move reflected their unhappiness at the Telengana Rashtra Samitis pressure tactics to garner more seats and senior partner Telugu Desam Partys inability to do anything about it.        
	The decision came at party meetings attended by CPM general secretary Prakash Karat and politburo member Sitaram Yechury.        
	Speaking to reporters, CPM state secretary B.V. Raghavulu said the party had decided to file nominations wherever it felt it was strong enough. But he kept a door open for reconciliation, saying: We shall sort out the seats later when the date of withdrawal approaches.        
	The alliance  dubbed Mahakutami (grand confederation)  was already in trouble with the Telugu Desam and Telengana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) unilaterally announcing one list after another.        
	The CPM had in protest brought out one list of 15 Assembly and three Lok Sabha seats. This was already higher than the 15 Assembly and two Lok Sabha seats that the Telugu Desam had earmarked for each of the Left parties, the CPM and the CPI.        
	Of the states 294 Assembly and 42 Lok Sabha seats, the Telugu Desam is willing to give the TRS 48 but the smaller party wants more.        
	Seat allocations were delayed for over four days last week after the TRS threatened to walk out over its disputes with the Telugu Desam. The Left had then brokered peace.        
	Todays CPM announcement brings matters to a head, and the CPI too has decided to announce candidates without waiting for an understanding with the Telugu Desam.        
	Why blame us? When the two other alliance partners, the Telugu Desam and the TRS, are allowed to play dirty, why cant we? a CPM politburo member said.        
	The CPM had taken the lead to form the alliance but now feels the two regional allies are taking the Left parties for a ride. The party is also angry that the Telugu Desam has not been able to force the TRS to withdraw from four seats where it has fielded candidates despite the CPM having asked for these constituencies.        
	These seats are Mangalagiri (Krishna), Warangal East, Uppal (Hyderabad) and Ibrahimpatnam (Ranga Reddy).        
	The CPM decision comes as bad news to the Telugu Desam, one of whose star campaigners, NTR Junior, is injured in a road accident and has been out of action for over three weeks. Most of its leaders in the crucial East and West Godavari districts have walked over to the Praja Rajyam.        
	The Congress and actor Chiranjeevis Praja Rajyam Party have been scoffing at the alliances problems.

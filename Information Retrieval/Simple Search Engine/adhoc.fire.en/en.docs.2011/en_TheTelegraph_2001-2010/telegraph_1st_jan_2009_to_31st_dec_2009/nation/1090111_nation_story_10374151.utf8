The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Clap! Comrade Karat on stage
                                                                                                               Clap! Comrade Karat on stage
          JAYANTH JACOB                           Karat: Cadre commandments                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 10: When Prakash Karat takes the stage, clap  this was what the CPM told its cadre in Kochi.        
	With election prospects not too good in Kerala and Bengal, the party clearly didnt want to take a chance at the rally that the party general secretary and chief ministers of both states addressed yesterday.        
	The instruction to applaud Karat wasnt the only one handed to CPM workers by the state party unit. There was another  dont drink.        
	Every party wants its cadre to be disciplined. There is no need to read anything into it, snapped a senior leader from the state.         
	Disciplined is what party workers werent in Kottayam last year, when drunken scenes marked the state conference. At the end of that meet, as Kerala chief minister V.S. Achuthanandan took the stage, the cadre went berserk with applause. Some of the exuberance came out of the bottle.         
	State secretary Pinarayi Vijayan, who does not get along with Achuthanandan, later compared the meet to an Usha Uthup musical.        
	The party wouldnt have wanted any one leader to walk away with the applause in Kochi, leaving its general secretary high and dry.         
	So this time, the CPMs state unit decided to play safe with the two commandments  do clap for Karat and dont drink. It seemed to have worked, because the public rally passed without a hitch.        
	The three-day central committee meeting, which had taken Karat and other CPM leaders to Kochi, ended today.         
	At the meeting, the leaders discussed the bleak election prospects  as compared to the last time, when it swept both Bengal and Kerala.         
	Reports from both state units said the situation that helped the CPM score big victories in the 2004 general election does not exist any more. Then, the CPM-led Left Front had won 35 of Bengals 42 seats and 18 of Keralas 20 seats.         
	The defeat in two byelections has worried the party in Bengal, where it is also concerned about a possible electoral alliance between the Trinamul Congress and the Congress. The central committee has directed the state units to declare candidates early.

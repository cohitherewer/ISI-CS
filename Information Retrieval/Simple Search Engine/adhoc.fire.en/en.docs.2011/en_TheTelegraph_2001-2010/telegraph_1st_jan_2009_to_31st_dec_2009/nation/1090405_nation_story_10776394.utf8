The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | H-1B visas necessary, Obama govt tells court
                                                                                                               H-1B visas necessary, Obama govt tells court
                            
	Washington, April 4 (PTI): The Barack Obama administration has told a court the previous governments decision to extend the work permit for H-1B visa-holders was necessary to spare American companies competitive disadvantage they could have faced by losing skilled workers.        
	The March 23 submission before a Philadelphia court, in response to a lawsuit against the move, was the first indication of the new Democratic regimes stand on the visa, popular among Indian professionals.        
	Acting assistant attorney-general Michael F. Hertz said had the Bush government not extended the work permit from one year to 29 months, some 10,000 students with degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) would have had to leave America within 60 days.        
	It would have adversely affected the ability of US employers to recruit and retain skilled workers and created a competitive disadvantage for US companies, the government argued.        
	The matter had last year come up before a lower court in New Jersey which threw out the appeal filed by three US bodies, nine individuals and two students. The same petitioners approached the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia last month.        
	The government said the extension was necessary to retain talent. While it allowed skilled students to avoid the hardship of leaving the country to change their status, it gave employers ample time to file H-1B petitions on their behalf.        
	As indicated in the IFR (Interim Final Rule), there is an important economic interest for the United States in keeping STEM graduates from going to other countries that are providing increased opportunities to these students, the Obama government said in its petition.        
	The IFR would help attract STEM students to the United States. Otherwise, the United States will lose skilled technical workers in great need by high-tech industries.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 25: Tests for swine flu can now be conducted in Orissa as the state finally got its first laboratory facility for testing the H1N1 virus today.        
	Inaugurating the laboratory, health minister Prasanna Acharya said the facility would help minimise the delay in getting swab reports from national testing centres and also lessen the suspense, humiliation and ostracism faced by an alleged patient. The facility will test 38 samples at a time.         
	Regional research medical centre (RRMC) will, however, be using 10-15 samples initially and later on switch to full capacity. Samples will come from designated, government recognised, centres following guidelines. Equipped with bio-safety level-II (BSL-II) standard, the facility has been set up at RRMC, a unit of Indian Council of Medical Research. The facility includes RNA extraction, decontamination equipment and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).         
	Completion of this facility in one-and-a-half months is an example, said the minister, adding that more needs to be done for health-care system in tribal pockets.

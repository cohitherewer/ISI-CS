          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 14: The Congress today expressed frustration at new austerity benchmarks, asserting simplicity was a state of mind not measured in terms of one travel or a periodic stay.        
	The reaction came in response to questions on whether Sonia Gandhi would travel only economy class henceforth. The austerity debate peaked today after she decided to take a regular commercial flight to Mumbai and sat among ordinary passengers in the economy class.        
	Congress leaders said Sonias travel plans were decided on security considerations and the Special Protection Group may not allow her this freedom all the time.        
	A senior leader said Sonia had to risk her safety to convince those who thought luxurious life was a must. The allusion was to ministers S.M. Krishna and Shashi Tharoor, who tried to defend their stay in five-star hotels saying they had not used public money for it.

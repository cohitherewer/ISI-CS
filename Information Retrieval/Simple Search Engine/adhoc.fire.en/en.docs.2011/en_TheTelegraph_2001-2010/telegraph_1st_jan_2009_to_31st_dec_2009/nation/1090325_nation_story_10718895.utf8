The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | New BDR team, old Delhi vibes
                                                                                                               New BDR team, old Delhi vibes
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, March 24: A new Bangladesh Rifles delegation will arrive next week on a visit expected to generate as much warmth as earlier despite a change of guard after last months mutiny.        
	The March 31-April 1 trip by Brigadier-General Mainul Hossain, who took over as the BDR chief after Shakil Ahmed died in the rebellion, will be the first since the February 25-26 mutiny. Ahmed was credited with having improved the relations with the BSF.        
	Fortunately for India, some officers from Shakils team, including a brigadier-general and a senior aide of the slain BDR chief, survived the mutiny. Home ministry officials see this as a blessing since these officers, involved in border talks earlier, can now guide Hossains team.         
	We think they have passed on the legacy of good relations built during Ahmeds tenure, said a BSF source.        
	Hossain will bring only six officers to Delhi, less than half the size of earlier delegations that would often have over 15 officers. They would stay longer too.        
	The new BDR chief wrote to his counterpart in the BSF, M.L. Kumawat, a few days back that he was making the trip to thank Indian troops for their neutral role during the unrest.        
	The BDR top brass realise Indian forces could have taken advantage of the mutiny and possibly made a few incursions, but refrained from doing so. The spirit of co-operation could be traced back to a thaw in ties since 2005.        
	Hossain did not forget to touch an emotional chord, referring in his letter to the BSFs assistance in the 1971 War of Liberation that had led to the creation of Bangladesh.        
	India, too, is trying to ensure the guests are comfortable. The talks agenda does not include contentious issues. The Indian side could also go slow on its demand to deport separatist leaders in Bangladesh.        
	Such gestures are a far cry from the meetings between the officials of external affairs ministries of both countries. Angry arguments even on finalising the minutes often marred the discussions.        
	Hossain will meet home minister P. Chidambaram and home secretary Madhukar Gupta on March 30 and hold a meeting with the BSF brass led by Kumawat.

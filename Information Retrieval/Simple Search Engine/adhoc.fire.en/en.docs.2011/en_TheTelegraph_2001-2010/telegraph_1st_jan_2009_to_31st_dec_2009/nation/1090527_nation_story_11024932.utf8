										      G.S. RADHAKRISHNA      ...in perch in andhra                        Home minister Sabita Reddy after assuming charge				                                 
	Hyderabad, May 26: Andhra has done what few states in the country have: appointed a lady home minister.         
	Sabita Indra Reddy, 46, has been entrusted the key portfolio, which symbolises an unofficial number two rank in the cabinet pecking order.         
	None of the southern states has had a woman in the post, except Tamil Nadu where Jayalalithaa held the home portfolio when she was chief minister. In fact, barring women chief ministers (eg. Orissas Nandini Satpathy) holding the charge of home ministry, the department has almost always been an exclusive male reserve, including at the Centre where save for Indira Gandhi, no lady has ruled the roost over North Block.         
	At present, Mayavati, the second woman chief minister of Uttar Pradesh after Sucheta Kripalani, is the only other lady in charge of home affairs in the country.         
	If Mamata Banerjee does penetrate the Red citadel in 2011, she could become the first woman chief minister of Bengal, which prides itself on being progressive but has never had a lady in the top job or in the home ministry.         
	Sabita Reddys elevation is being perceived as a reward for being a good luck mascot for chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy.         
	In 2003, after his successful 1,500-km padayatra from Chevella  then represented in the Assembly by Sabita Reddy  which propelled him to power, YSR took her on as his chellamma (sister) and inducted her as the mines minister during his first term.        
	The chief minister launched all programmes, including election campaigns, from Chevella, which is also the Lok Sabha constituency of central minister S. Jaipal Reddy. YSR chose to launch his campaign for the 2009 elections also from the same town and became the first Congress chief minister in three decades to retain power.        
	Sabita Reddy had to shift to Maheswaram constituency near Hyderabad these elections owing to delimitation. Though chellammas charm waned somewhat in her old stronghold where the Congress did not fare as well as in the rest of the state, YSR chose her as his home minister.         
	There is a rider though. The chief minister will look after law and order while Sabita Reddy will handle jails, sainik welfare, home affairs, fire services and printing and stationery.        
	She replaces in the home ministry K. Jana Reddy, who was dropped along with three other senior ministers in the newly constituted council.        
	A third-time legislator, Sabita Reddy is the widow of P. Indra Reddy, who also served as home minister in N.T. Rama Raos cabinet. Indra Reddy, who joined the Congress later, was killed in a road accident on the outskirts of Hyderabad.        
	Sabita Reddy, who holds a BSc degree and is the mother of three sons, said her focus would be on tackling the Maoist problem in a state that has become the hub of the guerrillas. I am aware of the challenges of terrorism and Naxalism. I will tackle them effectively, she said confidently.         
	Of the 35 ministers sworn in yesterday, six were women. This is also a high number compared to other states.

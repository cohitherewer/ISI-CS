The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Goodbye Gandhi, welcome goon
                                                                                                               Goodbye Gandhi, welcome goon
          NALIN VERMA                          Buying Bapu                                  
	Patna, March 30: Liquor baron Vijay Mallya made India proud when he successfully bid and bought steel-rimmed spectacles, sandals, pocket watch, bowl and plate belonging to Mahatma Gandhi at an estimated cost of $1.8 million from James Otis. After all, Bapus belongings had finally come home.        
	But, what about those belongings that are already here? Though Indians sweated over items that were taken away, items belonging to the Father of the Nation that are lying at Bhittiharwa in north Bihars West Champaran constituency has received little attention.         
	It is in Bhittiharwa that Gandhi first settled in after he came from South Africa. There he set up an ashram and began his struggle to liberate India from the British rule. The ashram, according to its caretakers, contained Bapus wooden sandals, hand-spun cloths, charkha and mats besides a janta (hand-driven stone grinder to grind grains).         
	Except the grinder, everything else has disappeared from the ramshackle ashram located some 50km from Bettiah  the West Champaran headquarters.         
	Locals state that the belongings either perished in the rainwater that poured in through the ill-maintained roof or were stolen. The place, at best, serves as a rendezvous point for kidnappers and criminals who rule the region, said a resident, A.K. Mishra, adding, that Chandrashekhar was the last politician to visit the ashram in the early Nineties.         
	He did try to start a research centre there, but, the venture never took off.         
	The Congress is now fielding Rabri Devis brother, Sadhu Yadav, an accused in scam and criminal cases from West Champaran. Ironically, his first name (Sadhu) is similar to Mahatma that Indians use as a prefix before Gandhi.         
	This Sadhu  nominee of a party that Gandhi nursed  has done little to justify his name. He, however, has insisted: I am now in the Gandhi-Nehru party. I will try to emulate everything that Gandhi stood for. I will learn more about Bhittiharwa and am happy to contest from where Gandhiji launched his struggle to emancipate India.         
	Despite his enthusiasm, he seemed to have little idea about the alleged thefts in the ashram.         
	Sadhus party is fielding hotelier Samir Mahaseth from the adjoining Sitamarhi seat that had earlier seen a leader like Acharya J.B. Kripalani  a Gandhian  to the Lok Sabha in 1957. Kripalani might have belonged to Sindh (Pakistan), but Sitamarhi voters found Kripalanis Gandhianism as his ticket to their hearts.         
	Today, mainstream parties such as JD(U) and RJD have made the numerically preponderant Yadavs in the area as a consideration for selecting nominees. The JD(U) has pitted Arjun Rai  a Yadav  against RJDs Sitaram Yadav on this seat which of late has become a bastion of outlawed CPI(Maoist) guerrillas.         
	Talking from Dharamsala yesterday, US-based collector James Otis claimed that he owns rarer items belonging to Gandhi that he was ready to part with. His articles include the original Harijan, a journal edited by Bapu, cloths spun by him and his blood.         
	A Gandhian, Razi Ahmed, remarked: Liquor barons may buy Gandhis belongings by paying in crores, but few show readiness to resurrect the dying ideals. Razi may have a point.

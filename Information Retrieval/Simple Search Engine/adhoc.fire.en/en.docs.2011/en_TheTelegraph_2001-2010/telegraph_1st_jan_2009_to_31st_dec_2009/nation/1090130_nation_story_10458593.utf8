The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Padma award row 
                                                                                                               Padma award row 
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Srinagar, Jan. 29: A Kashmiri businessman awarded the Padma Shri was caught in a controversy after some people argued that he wasnt a craftsman and didnt deserve the honour.        
	The state governments statement that it hadnt recommended Hashmatullah Khan, who runs a handicrafts shop in Delhis Chandni Chowk and whose family here has been in the shawls business for 75 years, fuelled the row.         
	 I am shocked to see my name being dragged into this episode. I dont know who recommended my name, Khan said.         
	If this award is for the promotion of Kani shawls, then no person has done what I have done. Only a handful of people knew this craft. I started training two men in 1995, who reluctantly agreed to become artisans. It takes a lot of effort to weave a shawl. Today, by the grace of God, you have 5,000 artisans in the Valley.        
	 Kanis or wooden sticks with coloured threads, as many as 50 in some cases, are used to weave a weft and an artist can weave a maximum of an inch a day. It takes a year to weave a shawl.         
	Kashmir chamber of commerce president Mubeen Shah rallied behind Khan and said an arts body had recommended his name.

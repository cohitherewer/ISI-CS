The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | At last, LoC shrine opens
                                                                                                               At last, LoC shrine opens
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Srinagar, July 20: A Kashmir shrine on the Line of Control closed to people for decades for security reasons was opened yesterday thanks to the efforts of a local legislator.        
	Prayers broke the eerie calm in the shrine to Sufi saint Hazrat Manga Baji Sahib as MLA Sheikh Abdul Rasheed led hundreds of devotees.        
	Rasheed, the legislator from Langate, of which Leepa Valley is a part, was happy his efforts had paid off. The shrine had been closed to people for decades and only a handful of shepherds could make it to the place. But we could open it again, of course with the armys co-operation, he said.        
	According to him, the shrine was with Pakistan before the Indian Army took control of it during the 1971 war. People couldnt visit the place, neither when it was with Pakistan nor after that.        
	The shrine remained open today as well and scores more visited it.         
	I had gone to the place last year with a handful of people and pledged to have it opened. Thank God we succeeded in our endeavour. The shrine will act as a bridge to bring people of the two parts of Kashmir together, said Rasheed.        
	Over the last two decades, Leepa Valley was a key infiltration route for militants. But there has been a decline in infiltration in recent months, a reason that may have prompted the army to agree to open the shrine.        
	Rasheed, a separatist-turned-mainstream politician, was a close confidant of Sajjad Lone but broke ties with his mentor last year when he decided to contest the state elections. Sajjad, who opposed his decision then, himself fought the Lok Sabha elections a few months later but lost.        
	For the devotees, the shrines opening seemed the reward of a lifetime. It is a revered shrine for people on both sides of the LoC. I am glad I could make it here in my lifetime, Farooq Ahmad, a villager from nearby Handwara, said.         
	Ahmad also appeared captivated by the beauty of the valley. This valley can itself be a prime tourist destination, he said.

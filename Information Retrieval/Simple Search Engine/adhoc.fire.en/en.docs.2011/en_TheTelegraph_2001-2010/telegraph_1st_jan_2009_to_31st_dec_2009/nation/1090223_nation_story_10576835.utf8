          GAUTAM SARKAR                          Shibu Soren: Dreaming of a greater Jharkhand                                  
	Jamui/Banka, Feb. 22: Shibu Sorens decision to file nomination from Bihar for the forthcoming Parliament and Assembly elections, and to accelerate the JMMs demand for the inclusion of Jamui and Banka in Jharkhand, has generated tension in the ruling NDA camp.        
	On February 20, the party had held a public meeting at Chakai  a tribal-dominated block in rebel-hit Jamui district of eastern Bihar.         
	Addressing the meeting, Soren had promised to fight for the people of the region, including Banka and districts with a sizeable tribal population. Besides Banka and Jamui, Bhagalpur, Purnea, Kathihar and Saharsa are also on JMMs poll list from where it has decided to field five candidates for the Lok Sabha election and 15 for Assembly polls.        
	Former convenor of Akhand Jharkhand Peoples Front and a former Munger MP Pratap Singh has also agreed to help JMM provided the party respected peoples sentiments.        
	According to Singh, former president of Jharkhand Adivasi Mahasabha Jaymangal Singh had first made the demand for a separate Jharkhand on April 4, 1954. Jaymangal Singh had also chalked a map for the proposed Akhand Jharkhand Rajya before a state committee on May 31, 1954, that included the then Banka sub-division in Bhagalpur and Jamui subdivision in Munger, Pratap Singh added.         
	If JMM would start the movement for greater Jharkhand he would receive the wholehearted support of our party, Singh added.        
	Claiming that the then proposed state included Onker Barnawal and Jamui. Former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, too, assured that the two districts (Barnawal and Onker) would be included in Jharkhand during his Independence Day speech. We hope that JMM can now fulfil what has been till date only a dream and the demand of the regions people, he added.        
	On the other hand, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar has opposed the JMM demand stating that the regions people do not dream of joining another state.         
	Even after nine years, Jharkhands leaders have failed to lead their state towards progress. Jharkhands people are now frustrated with the chain of unsuccessful governments and leaders. People of Jamui and Banka, who experienced progress and development under the JD(U) rule, do not wish to be trapped in Jharkhand, Nitish Kumar said over the phone.        
	States agriculture minister Narendar Singh, who hails from Jamui, his son and Jamui JD(U) MLA, Abhay Singh, BJPs MLA from Chakai Falguni Yadav also slammed the JMM stand. The scenario has changed now and the people dont want to go to the darker side, Narender Singh said in a lighter tone.        
	RJD MP from Banka Lok Sabha seat Giridhari Yadav also condemned JMM and Soren for playing a dirty game. How dare they blame Lalu Prasad. The people would send them (JMM) a fitting reply by not voting. And their dream for a greater Jharkhand would remain just a dream.         
	Former JD(U) MP from the seat and former Union external minister Digvijay Singh also condemned Sorens demand.

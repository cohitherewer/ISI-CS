The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Arjun unhappy for ticket-less daughter 
                                                                                                               Arjun unhappy for ticket-less daughter 
          RASHEED KIDWAI                      Arjun: Disappointed                          
	April 4: An increasingly sidelined Arjun Singh today openly expressed disappointment at the Congress leadership, regretting the denial of a Lok Sabha ticket to daughter Beena and disagreeing with the party stand on Varun Gandhi.        
	Both Varuns (anti-Muslim) statement and the act of charging him under the National Security Act is unfortunate, the human resource development minister told reporters, prompting his party to distance itself from the comment.        
	Arjuns remarks were his individual opinion, said ministry colleague and Congress spokesman Kapil Sibal, a lawyer who has justified the use of the NSA against Varun.        
	Arjun added: I cant deny I am disappointed that my children have not got tickets.        
	Beena today filed her nomination from Sidhi as an Independent after the Congress fielded Inderjit Patel, considered an Arjun loyalist, from the Madhya Pradesh seat.        
	The veteran politician that he is, Arjun, however, knows he may face party action if he campaigns for his daughter. I will campaign for the party, he said, without specifically referring to Sidhi. But he conveyed his unhappiness: I will not contest.        
	Arjun is a Rajya Sabha member and was not expected to contest the Lok Sabha polls.        
	Sources said one reason for his heartburn was his failure to prop up a successor from his family. His son Ajay is a four-time Congress MLA, but father and son are allegedly not on the best of terms.        
	When Beenas name was first aired for Sidhi and Satna, the most vocal opposition had come from Ajay who questioned her familiarity with the constituencies and her ability to win. The son suggested it was he who deserved the Lok Sabha ticket. Today, Ajays supporters in Bhopal said Arjuns remarks may hurt his sons political future.        
	Arjun  three-time chief minister, former governor, and cabinet minister under Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, P.V. Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh  has a long list of grudges against the Congress leadership.        
	In May 2004, he was disappointed when Sonia Gandhi named Manmohan Singh for Prime Minister. In 2007, he had privately nursed an ambition to move into Rashtrapati Bhavan, primarily on the basis of longstanding loyalty to the Family, but was overlooked.        
	Three years ago, he had written to Sonia that Manmohan was not giving him adequate protection in the controversy surrounding the OBC quota in higher education. The complaint was summarily dismissed.        
	Today, however, he was cautious about Manmohan, saying he had come out quite well in spite of his health problems and his return as Prime Minister would be justified and desirable.        
	Arjuns marginalisation had gained momentum when, a few months ago, he jumped the gun to publicly back Rahul Gandhi as the candidate for Prime Minister. Around the same time, he had alleged that party decision-making had become skewed and loyalty was being defined in a narrow sense. He was summoned to 10 Janpath and told to make amends.        
	Arjun has also failed to accept the rise of Digvijay Singh, his one-time protg, as his successor from Madhya Pradesh. The duo fell out in 1995 when Digvijay declined to join Arjuns breakaway Congress (T), formed in protest against Raos leadership.        
	Since then, Arjun has been unsuccessfully trying to tame Digvijay, who is now a key member of Rahuls team as well as the partys publicity and campaign committees.

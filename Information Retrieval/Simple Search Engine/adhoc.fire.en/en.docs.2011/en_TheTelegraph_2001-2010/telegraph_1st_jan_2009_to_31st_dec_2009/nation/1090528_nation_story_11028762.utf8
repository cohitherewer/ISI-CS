The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nigerians held for city fraud
                                                                                                               Nigerians held for city fraud
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 27: Two Nigerians suspected to have tricked several Calcutta residents into parting with nearly Rs 40 lakh by promising them Internet lottery wins have been arrested in the capital, police said today.        
	Earnest Ucheuna Ughabuga, 31, and Anthony Obinawa, 27  who had both come to India on student visas  were picked up from their west Delhi residence after the city police were alerted by their Calcutta counterparts.        
	An accomplice who operated the bank account in which the victims transferred their money is still absconding.        
	The Calcutta police detective branch asked for our help after it received a complaint from a woman called Sunanda Banerjee who alleged that she was duped into depositing Rs 1.22 lakh by people who claimed that she had won a lottery worth Rs 23.5 lakh. They trailed the duo to Delhi, said additional commissioner (crime), Satyendra Garg.        
	Banerjee told the police she had received a mail that said she had won a lottery of Britain-based Shell Petroleum Development Company and asked her to deposit Rs 1.22 lakh in the account as processing fee. She was also told to contact a claims manager in case of any queries.        
	It was only after she deposited the amount that Banerjee realised she had been duped when all efforts to contact the claims manager failed.

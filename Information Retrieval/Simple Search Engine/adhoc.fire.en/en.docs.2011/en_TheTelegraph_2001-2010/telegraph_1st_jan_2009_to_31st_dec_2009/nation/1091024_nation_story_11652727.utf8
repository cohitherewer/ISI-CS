          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 23: A top UN official has said the outcome of international climate change talks at Copenhagen later this year will hinge on four crucial elements  two linked to greenhouse gas emissions and two to finance and technology.         
	More than 192 countries, negotiating strategies to combat climate change for the period beyond 2012, will meet in Copenhagen in December to wrap up the talks and set the stage for action.         
	The four elements that hang together will be crucial for a successful outcome of the Copenhagen conference, Yvo de Boer, executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), said.         
	Well need clear, ambitious emissions reduction targets for industrialised countries, clarity on limitations of growth of emissions in developed countries and a financial package on the table, de Boer said at a conference organised by India and the UN on technology issues related to climate change. Well also need clarity on the institutional mechanisms to manage finance and technology.         
	Under a pact adopted at Bali two years ago, industrialised countries were expected to take on substantial legally binding emission reduction targets for the period after 2012. The developing countries were expected to pursue nationally adopted (climate change) mitigation actions with financial support and climate-friendly technologies from the industrialised countries.         
	The UN official said the Copenhagen conference would also have a greater chance of success if short-term funding commitment was visible. About $10 billion on the table for immediate disbursement, de Boer said.         
	The funds are intended to help developing countries get access to climate-friendly technologies and to adapt to climate change. The bill for technology deployment and adaptation may rise to $200 billion each year by 2020.         
	The Delhi conference concluded today with a call for action to accelerate the large-scale global deployment of climate-friendly technologies and to minimise the time lag between their initial development and deployment in developing countries.         
	India and other developing countries have asked industrialised nations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per cent from their 1990 levels by 2020. But industrialised countries want India and China to join the mitigation process.         
	Danish climate and energy minister Connie Hedegaard, speaking at the conference, said Copenhagen would be looking for strong mitigation commitments from industrialised countries and strong mitigation actions from the developing countries.         
	India has said its domestic mitigation actions  such as improving energy efficiency and expanding renewable energy programmes  will not be open to international scrutiny, except when they are supported by international funding.         
	The climate change negotiations are intended to slow down the growth in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere to prevent a rise in global average temperatures.         
	Scientists point out that time is running out. To limit the temperature rise to about 2C, the world will have to peak its (greenhouse gas) emissions within five or six years, said Rajendra Pachauri, chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a UN agency.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | IIM-A fees up by half a lakh
                                                                                                               IIM-A fees up by half a lakh
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                    IIM Ahmedabad director Barua (left) on Sunday. (PTI)                          
	Ahmedabad, March 29: The countrys top IIM today increased the fees for its post-graduate programme in management by Rs 50,000 from 2010-11, citing mounting costs and hinting that the rising number of OBC students had added to its burden.         
	The decision to raise the fees at IIM Ahmedabad was taken by the board of governors, headed by chairman Vijaypat Singhania, at a meeting today.         
	Last year, we had decided that the fees for the postgraduate programme in management for 2008-09 would be Rs 5.5 lakh and for 2009-10 it would be Rs 6 lakh. The board today decided that the fee for the year 2009-10 for the incoming batch will remain the same, institute director Samir Barua said after the board meeting.         
	For the second year, that is 2010-11, the fee will be Rs 6.5 lakh, an increase of Rs 50,000. So now, as per the revised fee structure, the batch of 2009-11 of the PGPM will be paying a maximum of Rs 12.5 lakh for the course.         
	The director defended the step, saying: With the passage of time, the cost of teaching goes up. We have to account for the increase in the cost of everything.         
	Despite the fee hike, he explained, the average fee collection would dip at the IIM as the quota for the Other Backward Classes would be increased to 13 per cent this year from last years 6 per cent. The OBC (quota) applies to mainly the non-creamy layer so the income levels will be below Rs 4.5 lakh per annum. Therefore, a large number of OBC students will be entitled to subsidies under our fee-waiver scheme, Barua said.         
	Barua said the fee-waiver scheme that was started last year would continue next year. There were 21 students last year who did not have to pay anything at all for the course, he said, adding that 65 per cent students benefited from the fee-waiver scheme because of the graded fee structure  a system of linking the fees with the family income of the students.        
	Sources said the reason for revising the fees was the institutes fast depleting corpus because of the pay revision, infrastructure expansion and other financial burdens.         
	The global meltdown has also impacted money-spinning executive programmes run by the institute, the sources said. So much so that the institute had decided to seek central grants for infrastructure expansion programmes  something it had not done in the last five years after going on a collision course with the HRD ministry during the NDA regime.

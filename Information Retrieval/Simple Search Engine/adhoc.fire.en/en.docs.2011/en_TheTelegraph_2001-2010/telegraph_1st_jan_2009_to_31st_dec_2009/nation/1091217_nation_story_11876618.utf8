	New Delhi, Dec. 16 (PTI): The Union cabinet today approved the Hindu Adoption and Marriage (Amendment) Bill that will give women separated from their husbands the right to adopt a child.        
	Till now only a divorced woman had the right to adopt a child. But after this bill is passed, women who are separated and not divorced can also adopt a child, a cabinet minister said after the approval.        
	The amendment is aimed at providing equal rights to women.         
	The bill will now be sent by the women and child development ministry to the law ministry for vetting after which it will be tabled in Parliament for discussion.        
	Central Adoption Resource Agency (CARA) of Women and Child Development Ministry, along with several NGOs and other organisations, had been mulling over this change in the law for sometime.

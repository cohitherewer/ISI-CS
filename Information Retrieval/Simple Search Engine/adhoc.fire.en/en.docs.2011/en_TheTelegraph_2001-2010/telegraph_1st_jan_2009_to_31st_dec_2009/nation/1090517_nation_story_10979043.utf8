The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | End of Advani era looms, guide role beckons
                                                                                                               End of Advani era looms, guide role beckons
          SANJAY K. JHA                          Advani: Last battle?                                  
	New Delhi, May 16: The end of the Advani era in the BJP is almost here.        
	Till today the BJPs Prime Minister-in-waiting, L.K. Advani announced at a meeting of the parliamentary board, the partys highest decision-making body, that he would not become the next leader of Opposition.        
	The board unanimously rejected his proposal this evening and asked him to continue, but sources said it was more of an honourable send-off to a veteran who had built the party brick by brick over the last six decades.        
	The BJP will elect a new Opposition leader and, like Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Advani will continue in the Lok Sabha as chairperson of the NDA. Arun Jaitley gave away the game to the media by saying Advaniji will continue to guide the party.        
	The choice of verb appears significant as party leaders have so far used lead for Advani and guide for Vajpayee. Advani has indicated in the past that he wanted to retire from politics.        
	Although Advani today said he would remain active in politics, he seems to have taken the first step towards retirement by withdrawing from the race for Opposition leader. The BJP will have to build a new leadership for the next election.        
	The basic difference between Vajpayee and Advani is that the latter is in good health and the party would not like him to withdraw for fear of an ugly struggle among second-rung leaders. Their lack of mutual respect is likely to be exposed when the process to select the Opposition leader gets underway.        
	Sources said Sushma Swaraj would have been the obvious choice but the victories of Murli Manohar Joshi, Rajnath Singh and Jaswant Singh had complicated the matter.        
	The leaders are aware that stepping into Advanis shoes as Opposition leader would be more beneficial than becoming BJP president. Rajnaths term ends later this year.        
	While Joshi is likely to push his claim on the basis of seniority, Rajnath could do everything to suitably engage himself before he relinquishes the office of BJP boss. He cannot be given twin responsibilities as his presidential term has a few months to go.        
	Sushma has a better understanding of parliamentary procedures and superior oratory skills than her rivals. The advantage she enjoys is the support of Advani who would certainly not like Rajnath or Joshi to succeed him.        
	If the tussle becomes very intense, Jaswant Singh, the partys Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, could emerge as a compromise candidate.        
	But Jaswant, whose win from Darjeeling has come as a gift and who has no political clout, is unlikely to be a good investment for the future. Most leaders feel the choice will finally narrow down to Sushma and Joshi.        
	Joshi does not have too many friends in the BJPs central establishment but he has good relations with Narendra Modi. He may also get RSS backing. But if Advani manages to influence the decision, Sushma is likely to be the next Leader of Opposition.        
	In the Rajya Sabha, Arun Jaitley may be elevated to the post of Opposition leader.        
	The BJP parliamentary board also adopted a resolution congratulating Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh.        
	It said: India needs political stability. It needs to put the national economy on track. It needs to strengthen national security. For these challenges, people have given a mandate to the UPA leadership to govern. The BJP and its allies, while acting as a constructive Opposition, will fully co-operate with the government in strengthening India.        
	Unlike the bitter reaction after the 2004 defeat, the BJP said this time: We accept the mandate of the people of India with all humility. We shall do our utmost to honour the spirit of this mandate.        
	Advani himself phoned both Manmohan and Sonia and congratulated them.

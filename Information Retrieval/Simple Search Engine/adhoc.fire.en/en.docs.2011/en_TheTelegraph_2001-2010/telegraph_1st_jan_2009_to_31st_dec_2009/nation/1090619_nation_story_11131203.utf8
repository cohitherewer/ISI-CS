          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Srinagar, June 18: Kashmir University will host a day-long convocation  seen by many here as pro-India activity  on its campus on Saturday for the first time since militancy started two decades ago.        
	Around 900 past students who have graduated since 2003 when the last convocation was held  away from the campus in a high-security zone  will be awarded their degrees at the event where Vice-President Hamid Ansari will be the chief guest.        
	Professor M.A. Qureshi, chairman of the convocation organising committee, said there was no politics in picking Ansari. He is an internationally acclaimed scholar and a diplomat who has authored many books, he said.         
	It is the presence of a national leader as chief guest that has made such occasions controversial in the past.         
	The last convocation that was held within the university premises was in 1984. It should normally have been an annual feature but because of the disturbed situation here, we could hold barely two such programmes after that, a university official said.         
	The convocations were held in 1997 and 2003 but both were hosted outside the university in a high-security zone. In 2003, then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee presided over the event.        
	Security was certainly a reason to host those functions outside but another reason is that our state-of-the-art convocation centre has only come up recently, the university official said.         
	University sources said a convocation had been planned last year but it was shelved following the Amarnath land agitation.         
	Protests after last months rape and murder of two women  allegedly by security forces  in Shopian, south Kashmir, have given students an additional reason to agitate against the event.         
	Students will boycott the event and some have even planned protests on that day, a students union leader said.         
	But the university is determined to go ahead with its programme and has taken steps to ensure a hassle-free event.        
	There will be no student participation in the event. The university has suspended classes for four days from June 17 to June 20 to keep students away. It has also directed the students in all its five hostels  Shaikh-ul Alam, Haba Khatoon, Rabia Basri Hostel, Mehboob-ul Alam Hostel and Moulana Anwar Shah Hostel  to leave the premises, which they have already done, one official said.         
	Qureshi said space constraint was the reason for keeping the students away. We have hundreds of invitees, including the awardees who are the pass-outs of this university. It is more important to have them than current students.         
	The university has in addition passed orders asking employees to ensure their attendance during these four days so that all the necessary arrangements are made. In case there is a strike on June 20, the university has made transport facilities available for the employees and the awardees at 20 different locations, a university official said.         
	Although, in the past, some teachers have expressed reservations on hosting convocations, Kashmir University Teachers Association president Noor Bilal said they had no reason to boycott the June 20 programme.        
	This is purely an academic function, he said. Why shouldnt we participate?

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Faction twist in mayor race
                                                                                                               Faction twist in mayor race
          LALMOHAN PATNAIK                              
	Cuttack, Feb. 10: The race for mayor has taken a twist with two groups within the BJD locking horns for the coveted post.        
	However, the BJD leadership is making an effort to zero in on a unanimous candidate to be elected on Friday.        
	Signals from within the BJD, which won 37 out of 54 wards in the civic polls, indicate that an apparent contest has been on between candidates backed by two groups  one led by Choudwar MLA and Cuttack district BJD president Dharmananda Behera and the other by Pravat Biswal, the partys Cuttack Sadar MLA.        
	While Beheras group is reportedly in favour of corporator Madhusudan Sahu, Biswal is making all efforts to get a corporator from the Cuttack Sadar area elected to the top post. Sahu, the city BJD president and deputy mayor in the last municipal council, is obviously the frontrunner. He made a hat-trick by winning from ward No. 22 last week with highest number of votes. Three other MLAs, one of them a minister and another a former minister, are also apparently in his favour.        
	A mayor from among corporators elected from wards in the Sadar area, on the other hand, is being pursued vigorously by Biswal on the basis of number game. BJD candidates had won from 20 of the 27 wards in the area. Biswal is known for his proximity to Rajya Sabha MP and party heavyweight Pyarimohan Mohapatra.        
	Behera, however, said: Our party leader Naveen Patnaik has the final say over the choice of candidate. We will abide by his decision. Sahu echoed him.        
	Sources in the BJD said today that party strategist Mohapatra was doing his best to get a unanimous candidate chosen for the post. Meetings to decide on the candidate and arrive at a consensus would be held within the next two days.

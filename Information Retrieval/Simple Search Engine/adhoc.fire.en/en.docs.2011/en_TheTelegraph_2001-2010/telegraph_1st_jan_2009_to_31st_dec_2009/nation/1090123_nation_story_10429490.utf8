          OUR BUREAU                          Mohammad Azharuddin after meeting AICC general secretary Veerappa Moily in Hyderabad on Thursday. (PTI)                                  
	Hyderabad/New Delhi, Jan. 22: Mohammad Azharuddin could turn out for the Congress in the next general election, at least as campaigner if not as candidate.        
	The former cricketer met M. Veerappa Moily, the Congress leader in charge of Andhra Pradesh, chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy and state party unit chief D. Srinivas at the Lake View guest house in Hyderabad today.        
	He met us and expressed his desire to serve the Congress party and the country, Moily said. He had met party president Sonia Gandhi in October in Delhi.        
	Azhar was Indias most successful captain before Sourav Ganguly.         
	Moily skirted a question whether Azhar would be fielded from Hyderabad, saying: Thats a different matter.        
	Congress sources in Delhi said Azhar was more likely to be used as star campaigner than candidate because of the problem of finding a safe seat for him to contest.         
	Hyderabad was an option but it is held by Asaduddin Owaisi, chief of the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, a UPA constituent. Sources said the Congress was unlikely to want to upset its equation with Owaisi. Moreover, Hyderabad has been the MIMs borough for years and voters were unlikely to desert the party for a non-political candidate like Azhar, they said.        
	However, sources in Hyderabad said the Congress was also looking at Nalgonda and Nizamabad, other than the capital city.        
	Asked about the match-fixing taint on Azhar, Moily shrugged: There may be a ban on his playing first-class cricket but not on joining politics and campaigning.        
	On Monday, Azhar had dismissed reports that he was joining the Congress. I dont know who announced it from Delhi. I have not told anyone about my political interest. Whenever I decide, I will invite the media and announce it.        
	He was not reachable for comment today.        
	YSR revealed on Tuesday that the former cricketer had told close friend and Congress leader Kiran Kumar Reddy that he wanted to join the party, but that he had not heard from Azhar.        
	In Delhi, Congress sources said the rush to hold the meeting followed the sudden announcement of Sanjay Dutts candidature as Samajwadi Party nominee from Lucknow. Azhar, too, was on Amar Singhs radar and might have joined the Samajwadis had the Congress been slow to act, they said.        
	In 2004, he was invited by Telugu Desam party chief Chandrababu Naidu to contest from Hyderabad. Even the MIM had tried to woo him.

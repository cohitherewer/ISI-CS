                                                                                                               CISF cover for Reliance refinery, IT giants
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, April 24: The Central Industrial Security Force will for the first time guard private-sector complexes, with the government clearing its deployment at Wipro, Infosys, Electronics City in Bangalore, and the Reliance refinery in Gujarats Jamnagar.        
	The move follows intelligence warnings of terror attacks on vital installations after the Mumbai carnage.        
	The central force will handle core security duties, said CISF spokesperson, deputy commandant Rohit Katiyar. Other sources said the force might also be entrusted with access-control duties.        
	It may be a mix of private security services and the CISF, an official revealed.        
	A survey of the complexes security needs was carried out recently, sources said, after which the CISF and the home ministry gave the go-ahead. The next step to be decided is the size of deployments.        
	The private companies will pay the CISF according to deployment and threat perception. The government last year sanctioned 40,000 more personnel for the force, to be recruited over two years.        
	The Reliance group had applied for CISF security early this year along with software companies. Several leading hotels too had sought paramilitary cover after gunmen targeted the Taj and Oberoi-Trident in Mumbai in November.        
	Considering the threat from the seaside  the Mumbai gunmen had come in boats  CISF commandos are likely to be positioned at strategic locations in the Reliance refinery, which is located by the sea.        
	Electronics City houses more than 100 private companies in information technology and electronics, such as Hewlett-Packard, Siemens and Satyam.         
	It had emerged as a potential target as early as the aftermath of the attack on the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, in November 2005.

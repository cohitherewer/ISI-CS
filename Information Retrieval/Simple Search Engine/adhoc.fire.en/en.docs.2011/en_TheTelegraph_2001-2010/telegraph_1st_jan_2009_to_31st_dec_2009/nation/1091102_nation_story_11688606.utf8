The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP rules out CM change
                                                                                                               BJP rules out CM change
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 1: The BJP has ruled out axing Karnataka chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa and is trying to work out a deal to mollify the rebel MLAs calling for his head.        
	There is no question of replacing the chief minister but other outstanding issues can be discussed and thrashed out, former MP and Karnataka BJP spokesman Dhananjay Kumar said.        
	Asked to respond, J. Shantha, MP from Bellary and a protege of the Reddy brothers who allegedly spearhead the revolt against Yeddyurappa, said: My slogan is Paksha bachao, CM ko hatao (save the party, oust the CM).        
	The Reddy brothers, two of them state ministers and the third an MLA, represent the powerful mining lobby of Bellary.        
	The BJP brass today met representatives from both the Karnataka camps, but mainly for forms sake. The central leaders accepted that the chief minister needed to alter his style of functioning but felt they could not ignore factors favourable to him, such as caste equations.        
	Yeddyurappa is from the Lingayat caste, which is to Karnataka what the Jats are to Haryana and the Marathas to Maharashtra. He has been the most influential Lingayat politician since S. Nijalingappa and Veerendra Patil, and commands the backing of the religious mutts controlled by the community, sources said.        
	The central leadership may tell the chief minister to drop confidante Shobha Karandlaje from the cabinet and induct another woman instead. Shobha, the rural development and panchayati raj minister, is the lone woman minister in the state.        
	Sources close to Yeddyurappa claimed that dropping her might send out a wrong signal but Shantha disagreed.        
	Nobody should fall for the gender bait, she said. Shobha is not a role model for women. She functions like an extra-constitutional authority, flies around in a helicopter, orders MLAs about and humiliates them.        
	Shanthas brother and state health minister B. Sreeramulu is among an uncertain number of MLAs who want state Speaker Jagadish Shettar to be made chief minister.        
	The BJP brass is expected to ask Yeddyurappa to ensure that critical administrative decisions are taken through consultation. Even a source close to him said such decisions were now taken by the chief minister and Shobha.        
	Sources said the BJP leadership believed that changing the chief minister would amount to a surrender to the Reddy brothers. They said that with the Congress wary of the brothers after they spirited away Congress MLAs to the BJP and the Janata Dal (Secular), this was the time to bring the trio to heel.        
	Union law minister M. Veerappa Moily, who is from Karnataka, said: The Congress is keeping a distance from the happenings.        
	State home minister V.S. Acharya and Dhananjay Kumar, both pro-Yeddyurappa, met party president Rajnath Singh and L.K. Advani separately. Speaker Shettar, from the rebel camp, met Arun Jaitley, the general secretary in charge of Karnataka, and Bangalore MP Ananth Kumar. The Reddy brothers will be in Delhi tomorrow.

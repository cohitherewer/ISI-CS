The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | UPs got enough, says Sonia
                                                                                                               UPs got enough, says Sonia
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	New Delhi, May 28: Congress president Sonia Gandhi and general secretary Rahul Gandhi have bluntly rejected suggestions that Uttar Pradesh has gone under-represented in the new government.        
	They have indicated the party would have to fetch much better returns from the state to get a greater share of the ministerial pie.        
	MoS kaafi nahin hain (arent MoSes enough)? There are two of them with independent charge, Sonia retorted on being asked why Uttar Pradesh, Indias most populous state, had gone without a cabinet-level minister at the Centre for the first time.        
	Pressed on the point, she resorted to half-jest and pointed to Rahul standing beside her: Here is the reason why UP has fewer ministers, he refuses to become a minister.        
	Uttar Pradesh has five ministers of state  Salman Khursheed, Sriprakash Jaiswal, both with independent charge, Jitin Prasada, R.P.N. Singh and Pradeep Jain.        
	The Congress tally from the state this time, 21, far exceeded the expectations of most in the high command and was enough to prompt state party chief Rita Bahuguna-Joshi to openly demand six ministerial berths. But Sonia said: We have only got 21 out of 80.        
	Rahul, who has declared his ambition is to turn the Congresss fortunes around in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, said: It is wrong to measure UPs importance only in ministerial terms, we have been working there silently, you will see the results in two or three years.

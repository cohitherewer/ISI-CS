	Sept. 10: Behind-the-scenes lobbying to make Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddys son Jaganmohan chief minister is in full swing despite the Congress high commands snub.        
	Eleven of the partys 33 MPs from Andhra Pradesh met Pranab Mukherjee today to argue Jaganmohans case. Mukherjee took note of Jaganmohans capabilities, talent and abilities, said Sai Prathap, who led the MPs. Former Union minister and Andhra leader Renuka Choudhary also met Mukherjee, separately.        
	Yesterday, YSR confidant K.V.P. Ramchandra Rao, the campaigns spearhead, completed meetings with the top brass, including Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh. Rao is said to have claimed that no leader had as much support as Jaganmohan.        
	The fresh pitch came on a day TV channels in Andhra carried surveys claiming 78 to 87 per cent of the respondents favoured Jaganmohan. Central leaders conceded that choosing the next chief minister would be difficult.        
	In Hyderabad, acting chief minister K. Rosaiah asserted he wasnt a lame duck CM even as many ministers, said to be from the Jaganmohan camp, stayed off meetings.

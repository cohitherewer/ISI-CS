The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP to tear report
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      BJP to tear report
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Dec. 5: The BJP has decided to dismiss the Liberhan Commission report as a politically motivated document and not express any regret for what happened on December 6 in Ayodhya 17 years ago.        
	Sources said the party would renew its pledge to build a Ram temple at the disputed site, as going defensive now could be counter-productive.        
	We will tear apart the report, a party source warned two days before Parliament debates the findings of the commission that called the demolition premeditated and held several top BJP leaders, including Atal Bihari Vajpayee, culpable.        
	The decision to counter-attack came on a day RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat re-ignited the sense of Hindu hurt, the old debate that sustained the Ayodhya movement.        
	He told reporters in Chandigarh there was no question of apologising for the Ram Janmabhoomi movement and there was no conspiracy to pull down the mosque. It was, he added, a spontaneous reaction of kar sevaks whose sentiments and emotions had been hurt.        
	Jinko afsos karna chahiye, wo karen (Those who need to regret, they can), Bhagwat said, asserting that the Sangh was committed to building a Ram temple.        
	The BJP has not celebrated December 6 after 1992 and former party chief L.K. Advani had even gone to the extent of saying that the day was the saddest of his life. But Bhagwats comment meant that the parivar was still speaking in different voices.        
	The VHP has announced the day would be celebrated as Shourya Diwas (Bravery Day).        
	VHP president Ashok Singhal said today: When they could not construct, they chose to demolish. It was a spontaneous decision and nobody expected the demolition to be completed in five hours as the building came down in five hours. Nobody planned it.        
	BJP sources said party president Rajnath Singh, who will lead the charge on Monday in the Lok Sabha, would express similar sentiments.

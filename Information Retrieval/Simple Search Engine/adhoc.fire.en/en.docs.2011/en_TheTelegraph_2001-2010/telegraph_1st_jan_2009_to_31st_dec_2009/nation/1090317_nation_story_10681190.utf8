The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sangh rushes to douse fire
                                                                                                               Sangh rushes to douse fire
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Jaitley (top), Rajnath: Face-off                                 
	New Delhi, March 16: The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh has joined the BJP brass to try and prevent the crisis triggered by Arun Jaitley from escalating tomorrow, when the partys central election committee sits again.        
	But Jaitley, who has been boycotting the committees meetings, is still sticking to his guns. Nor has BJP president Rajnath Singh, the other side in the controversy, shown any willingness to climb down.        
	Jaitley, the partys chief election campaigner, had skipped Fridays meeting of the committee over Rajnaths appointment of businessman Sudhanshu Mittal as co-in-charge of the partys Assam affairs.        
	The Sangh is worried about the controversy hurting the BJPs image in the run-up to the general election. It has told both Rajnath and Jaitley that the issue can be sorted out without damaging the party.        
	The BJPs candidate for Prime Minister, L.K. Advani, too has been working on Rajnath while Sangh leaders Suresh Soni and Ram Lal are trying to work out a compromise formula.        
	Jaitley aides, however, said he would not attend tomorrows meeting unless some concession was offered to him. Other sources said Rajnath had flatly refused to revoke Mittals appointment.        
	Although the Sangh would be unlikely to support someone of Mittals background, Rajnath has been emboldened by senior BJP leaders discomfiture with Jaitleys mode of protest.        
	Rajnath aides said the party presidents authority could not be undermined through public blackmail, and that Jaitley should have raised the issue privately without inviting media attention.        
	The Sangh and Advani are worried that if Jaitley misses tomorrows meeting too, it would set off another round of media speculation and strengthen the perception that the BJP was a divided house.        
	The meetings agenda includes discussions on the candidates for Uttar Pradesh and Delhi  which are under Jaitleys charge  as well as those for Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh.        
	Some party sources claimed the crisis would blow over before the meeting. One formula being suggested is to persuade Mittal to resign, thus sparing Rajnath any embarrassment while providing Jaitley with a reason to end his protest.        
	Mittal today said he was a loyal soldier of the party and would do anything the leadership asked him to. But he claimed he had not been asked to resign.        
	Advani played the controversy down at an interaction with reporters on the sidelines of a book release. This issue may make a good story for you, he said, but there are no differences within the party.

	Mumbai, March 17: The Indian Army has ordered a departmental inquiry against Lt Col Shrikant Purohit, named one of the four masterminds of the Malegaon blast, reports our special correspondent.        
	A three-member team, headed by a senior officer of the rank of brigadier, will conduct the probe.        
	Clarifying that it is not a court martial, a defence spokesperson said in a statement in Pune that the appointment of a brigadier indicated how seriously the army was treating the matter. The inquiry is in the form of an internal audit, Prashant Pathrabe said.

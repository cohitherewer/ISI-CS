          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Jan. 2: A medicinal plant garden built at an estimated cost of Rs 96 lakh was inaugurated beside the Bindusagar lake today.         
	Ekamravan Mythological Medicinal Plant Garden has 206 species of herbal plants and was thrown open to the public from today. Even a stroll through this park would rejuvenate the mind and soul, promised Ashok Mishra, the range officer of city forest division.         
	Developed by the forest division, the garden embraces elements of Ekamrakshetra mentioned in Ekamrasamhita, Swarnadri and Mohadaya scriptures that were studied diligently before construction began in November 2006. The 180 plants mentioned in the Purans were placed appropriately in the garden.         
	Visitors to this park would be welcomed by three trees  the mango symbolising Shiv, the amla and bel symbolising Parvati and Ganesh, respectively. While the plants around the mango tree are general medicinal plants, those alongside amla and bel are exclusively meant for women and children. The main trees would be fed with the water that will flow from the medicinal plant hedge adding to the nutrient value of the water, explained Mishra.         
	The park also has two pools  one with lotus and another with water lily in it. The water would be from the Bindusagar Lake. It would also have a music corner  a platform for programmes.         
	More than 100 artisans from Raghurajpur and Lalitgiri were hired to complete the work that ran for more than two years. We have tried to stay true to the architecture of the old town area, said Anupam Shah, the project director.         
	The few structures dotting the garden and its boundary wall are of sandstone and laterite  materials used for temples in the old town area of Bhubaneswar.         
	The boundary wall has carvings depicting Shivs stay at Ekamrakshetra.

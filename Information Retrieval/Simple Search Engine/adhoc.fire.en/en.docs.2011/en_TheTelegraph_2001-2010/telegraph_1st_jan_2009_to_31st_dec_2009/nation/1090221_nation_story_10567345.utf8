                                                                                                               Soren flak for Lalu
          GAUTAM SARKAR                              
	Chakai (Jamui), Feb. 20: Chakai in Bihar  a tribal block in rebel-hit Jamui bordering Jharkhands Deoghar and Giridih districts  became the weak spot for JMM to penetrate Lalu Prasads bastion today.         
	Party boss and former Jharkhand chief minister Shibu Soren who arrived here around 6pm, six hours behind schedule, lambasted the railway minister for damaging both Bihar and Jharkhand.         
	The JMM has set its sights on Bihar for the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections. The party, still a component of the UPA, today ticked off Lalu Prasads RJD from its ally list. It also held a public meeting in Chakai where they promised to fight for the regions people and for their (JMM) brothers in Bihar. Former Jharkhand deputy chief minister Sudhir Kumar Mahto, former minister Nalin Soren, JMM MLA Salkhan Soren, Bishnu Bhaiya and former JMM MLA Prashant Kumar Mandal, addressed the meeting along with a handful of local leaders.        
	Soren in his keynote address announced that the party would contest five Lok Sabha and 15 Assembly seats from Jamui, Banka, Bhagalpur, Purnea, Kathihar and Saharsa. Banka and Jamui are similar to Jharkhand in terms of topography and culture. People here do not want to see Lalu rule, said Mandal.         
	Nitish Kumar has introduced packages for us. On February 19 his vikas yatra came to Jamui. But, as far as the question of tribal sovereignty is concerned, we would prefer to stand on Sorens side, said a resident.

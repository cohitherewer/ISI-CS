          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 17: Varun Gandhi may have to make do with two personal security officers, even after meeting the home minister.         
	Sources close to the BJP MP said he had called on P. Chidambaram on Monday to remind him of his promise to upgrade Varuns security from Y category to Z-plus. However, ministry insiders claimed their boss gave no such assurance.        
	Z-plus category would mean inspectors, sub-inspectors and jawans from Delhi police. Under the Y-categ- ory, a person is entitled to just two personal security officers.         
	The ministry sources said the current set-up might be reviewed at an appropriate time, if at all.        
	A Varun aide said the MP from Pilibhit, whose anti-minority hate speech during a poll campaign had landed him in jail, had been facing death threats and was banking on Chidambaram to upgrade his security.        
	But there has been no message to the DCP (security) to beef up his security and Varunji cannot even travel to Uttar Pradesh because the Mayavati government will not help.

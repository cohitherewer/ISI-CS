          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Raipur, July 28: Armed with attractive incentives and pay packets, the Chhattisgarh government is in search of doctors to work in government hospitals.        
	The state recently conducted a recruitment drive through the Public Service Commission (PSC) to appoint doctors, but only managed to fill 25 per cent of the vacant posts. A recruitment drive was conducted for 1,200 posts lying vacant in the state, but we could hire only 350 doctors, said health minister Amar Agrawal, talking in the Assembly today.         
	Interestingly, of the 300 doctors, 250 are already working with the health department on a contract basis. In all, the department could get only 100 new doctors in the state to work for government hospitals.         
	Last year, too, the state selected 300 candidates after conducting tests through PSC. After appointment letters were sent out, most candidates looked the other way instead of joining a government job. The department has finalised a draft of incentives, Agrawal said.         
	The government would soon announce the packages that could help in filling the vacant posts, he added. Packages include the possibility to allow a doctor to stay in urban areas, though posts are vacant in the interiors.         
	Despite the department urging the government to not inaugurate new health centres in the state, the government went ahead and opened up quite a few that has resulted in vacant hospital minus doctors, the minister said.

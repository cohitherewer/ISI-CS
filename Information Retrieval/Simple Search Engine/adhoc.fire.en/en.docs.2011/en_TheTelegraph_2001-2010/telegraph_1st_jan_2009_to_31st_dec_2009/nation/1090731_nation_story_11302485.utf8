                                                                                                               Varsity bill passed in House
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, July 30: The controversial Vedanta University Bill was passed in the Assembly today amid Opposition protests, paving the path for the establishment of a private, world-class university proposed to be set up by UK-based Anil Agrawal Foundation with an investment of Rs 15,000 crore.        
	Prior to the recent general elections, a motion was moved for the introduction of the bill. However, it could not be introduced in the face of stiff protest from political parties.        
	The bill was re-introduced in the re-constituted Assembly on July 25 for its approval after the ruling BJD secured an absolute majority and the cabinet gave its nod.        
	According to existing law, no private university is allowed in the state. The bill aims to allow establishment of a private self-financing university for which an MoU had been signed between the Orissa government and the foundation in July, 2006. The bill was taken up for consideration yesterday afternoon, following which a marathon debate began.        
	Opposing the bill, BJP legislature party leader K.V. Singhdeo alleged that the Vedanta Group was trying to grab 6,000 acres along the Puri sea beach.         
	There are deposits of illeminite, lignite, zircon and synthetic rutile required for atomic energy generation in that land, he said.        
	However, higher education minister Debi Prasad Mishra dismissed the motive asserting that there was no established fact to prove that the land bore rare deposits.        
	Opposition chief whip Prasad Harichandan also opposed the Bill.         
	He stated that the proposed land was falling in an ecologically sensitive zone and a sweet-water zone. To that Mishra said that the university would contribute to socio, economic, educational and cultural development of the state.         
	The university would enrol 1-lakh students and appoint 20,000 faculty and an equal number of non-teaching staff.        
	An investment to the tune of Rs 15,000 crore would be made in the proposed university.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Singh skips House, worry over UK trip
                                                                                                               Singh skips House, worry over UK trip
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Singh, Advani                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 26: The Prime Minister struck an optimistic note on the 14th Lok Sabhas last day, assuring members in a message that the global economic crisis would leave India the least affected country.        
	Manmohan Singh, who could not make it to the House despite earlier indications about attending on the last day, apologised in the message, read out by foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee.        
	Singhs aides are fervently hoping he would be fit enough to travel to the London summit of the worlds advanced and emerging economies, including the G20, on April 2.         
	Sources said neither Mukherjee nor home minister P. Chidambaram could possibly travel to London and stand in for Singh: the date was too close to the Lok Sabha polls.        
	Since one of our campaign points will be the governments success in securing for India a place at the global high table, it will be unfortunate if the country goes un-represented (at the London summit), a minister said.        
	The summit aims at an agreement on co-ordinated action to revive the global economy. Singh is the only distinguished academic-economist world leader, an aide said. His prescriptions are bound to be taken seriously.        
	A second reason is, US President Barack Obama will attend the conference and Delhi hopes to squeeze in an interaction between him and Singh on the sidelines.        
	The Prime Minister, recovering after a bypass surgery, had to skip Parliament today because his doctors put their foot down after he got fever last Sunday, an aide said. Besides, he would have had to walk the 250 metres between the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha because he has refused to use a wheelchair. That was not considered medically appropriate, the aide said.        
	In the Lok Sabha, L.K. Advani wished Singh a speedy recovery but, at a news conference, heaped scorn on the Prime Minister. Advani repeated his pet peeve that Singh had cripplingly devalued the Prime Ministers office, not only because he was allegedly Sonia Gandhis surrogate but also because he had not been elected directly by the people.        
	Advani demanded that the Constitution be amended to make it mandatory for the Prime Minister to be a member of the Lok Sabha. Singh is a Rajya Sabha member. The BJP leader, however, had not raised this point when H.D. Deve Gowda or I.K. Gujral were Prime Minister while being Rajya Sabha members.        
	The 14th Lok Sabha will be remembered for many wrongs, the foremost being a crippling devaluation of the office of Indias PM. The Lok Sabha is directly elected by the people and hence enjoys a more democratic profile than the upper House, Advani said.        
	Singh has often been left smarting from Advanis attacks in the past. In his message to the Lok Sabha today, however, he thanked the BJP leader for always being constructive as we collectively addressed national challenges in spite of occasional disagreements.

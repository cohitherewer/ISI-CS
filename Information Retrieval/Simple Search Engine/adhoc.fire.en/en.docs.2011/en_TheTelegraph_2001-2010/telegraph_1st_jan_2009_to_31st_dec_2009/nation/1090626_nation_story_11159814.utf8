The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Bangla dam row
                                                                                                               Bangla dam row
                            
	Dhaka, June 25 (PTI): Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has said her government will go by her countrys best interests in finalising its stand on a dispute over a dam India is building in Manipur.        
	Her comments came days after Opposition leader and rival Khaleda Zia wrote to Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh urging him to stop the construction of the Tipaimukh Dam on the Barak river. Khaledas Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) said the dam would reduce water flow and make half of Bangladesh arid.        
	Hasina accused the Opposition of trying to make the dam a political issue. The BNP wants to play games instead of resolving it, she said.

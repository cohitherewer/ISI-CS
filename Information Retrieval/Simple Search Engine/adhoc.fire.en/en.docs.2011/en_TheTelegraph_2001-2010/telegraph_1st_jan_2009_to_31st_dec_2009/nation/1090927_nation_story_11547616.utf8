          OUR CORRESPONDENT                      A poster of Abhimanyu                          
	Cuttack, Sept. 26: Tales of love and violence by two debutant directors celebrate this festive season on the silver screen in the state.        
	While Anam Charan Sahoos Mitare Meeta and Abhimanyu of Sarthak Films were released during the past week, JRJ Medias Love Dot Com hit the maximum number of theatres across the state yesterday.        
	Sudhakar Vasant, a Chennai-based choreographer, has made his debut as director with Mitare Meeta, the story of an angry young man in a love triangle.        
	Similarly, Love Dot Com, a love story set in a campus, is the first directorial venture of Rahat Quddusi. Abimanyu, a gangsters love story, is the second Oriya film to be directed by Susant Mani, a noted film editor.         
	Love may be the common theme in the three films released but what make them stand out is the advanced technical standards involved in making them, said Pradip Sahu, a noted Oriya film critic.         
	But there is certainly an increased dose of violence in all these films, adds Sahu, a member of the regional advisory panel of the Central Board of Film Certification.        
	With Anubhav and Priya in the lead roles and popular stars like Aparajita and Mihir Das, the gangsters love story, Abhimanyu, has a happy ending. The love triangle in Mitare Meeta has Tanmoy and Nepali actress Namrata Thapa in lead roles with Lovelee as the other teenager.        
	Love Dot Com, on the other hand, is marked by the maiden presence of Megha Ghosh, a Mumbai-based Bengali actress, along with Sabyasachi in lead roles along with popular actors and actresses like Bijay Mohanty, Tandra Ray and Mihir Das. It has Mumbai-based Digbizay Singh, Kanhu Mukherjee and Riaz Khan as cinematographer, choreographer and fight master, respectively.

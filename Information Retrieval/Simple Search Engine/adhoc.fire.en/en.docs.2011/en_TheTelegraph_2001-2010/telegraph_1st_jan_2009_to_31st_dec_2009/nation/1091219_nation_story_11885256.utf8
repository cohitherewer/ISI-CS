	Ahmedabad, Dec. 18: Ignoring the governors advice to reconsider the death penalty clause in a bill aimed at checking sale of illicit liquor, the Gujarat government today reintroduced the legislation in the Assembly and passed it without any changes.        
	The Bombay Prohibition (Gujarat Amendment) Bill, 2009, had been returned by then governor S.C. Jamir on November 11. The Assembly had passed the bill in July after the hooch tragedy in Ahmedabad which claimed 155 lives.        
	The legislation prescribed death sentence or life imprisonment for those manufacturing, keeping, selling or making arrangements for preparing and distributing lattha (local spurious liquor) that results in the death of a person.

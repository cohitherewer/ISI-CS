The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Farooq adds a local twist
                                                                                                               Farooq adds a local twist
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                              
	Srinagar, Oct. 18: The controversy over the questioning of Kashmiri cricketer Parvez Rasool took a new twist today with Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association president Farooq Abdullah revealing that some people from the state had given false information to Karnataka police, which led to yesterdays drama in Bangalore.        
	Farooq, who is the Union minister for new and renewable energy, said he had asked the director-general of Jammu and Kashmir police to investigate the case. Look at what our own men can do, Farooq told The Telegraph.         
	He did not specify who the men were but police sources said they were exploring the possibility of mischief by some disgruntled cricketers who did not find place in the team.        
	A state cricket association official, however, called for caution in any such exercise. It could be that some boys were not happy with the selection but this happens everywhere. The government should be careful in handling the case, he said.        
	The new development unfolded as the cricket association decided to allow its team to play in Bangalore. The association had said yesterday that there was a possibility of recalling the team to protest the incident.        
	The issue has been settled. The Karnataka Cricket Association has apologised and our team will stay there and play, Farooq said.        
	The Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association office-bearers had earlier discussed several options. Later in the day, they asked the team members about their state of mind and sought their opinion on the future course of action.

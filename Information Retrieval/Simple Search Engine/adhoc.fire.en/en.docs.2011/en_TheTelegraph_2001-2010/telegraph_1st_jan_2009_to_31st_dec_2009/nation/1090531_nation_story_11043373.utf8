The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Top guns clam up, rest start to worry
                                                                                                               Top guns clam up, rest start to worry
          SANJAY K. JHA       
	New Delhi, May 30: With the top BJP leadership going into its shell  even spokespersons cant be traced and regular media briefings stand cancelled  middle-rung leaders and ordinary workers are worried about the partys future.         
	After the flutter created by L.K. Advanis offer to quit as leader of the Opposition, which was rejected, the party has been in a state of inaction.        
	The top leaders have met only once since to discuss the fate of Uttarakhand chief minister B.C. Khanduri, who too had offered to quit in the wake of the rout in the state, and decided against going in for a change.        
	There has been no other political activity in the BJP since the May 16 election defeat, even as party workers look to the leaders for guidance.        
	Advanis website, which made such a splash during the election campaign, has almost shut down.        
	Before its national executive on June 20-21, the party has to elect its leader in the Rajya Sabha. Reliable sources said only two names are in the reckoning  Arun Jaitley and Venkaiah Naidu  but the party is witnessing a fierce churning at different levels over these choices.        
	After the strong rebuff to Murli Manohar Joshi, who reacted enthusiastically to Advanis offer to quit, no leader has mustered the courage to speak up. But there is a strong undercurrent of resentment. A party MP summed up the mood: Senior leaders are not worried about the partys fate, they are jockeying for their own positions. If there is nobody who can be held accountable, there should at least be a collective effort to build a new leadership. This state of paralysis is having a demoralising effect on everybody; the younger leaders, party cadres and our sympathisers as well.         
	Many in the party strongly feel this is the time to invest in leaders who have mass appeal. The second rung leaders, including Sushma Swaraj, Arun Jaitley, Venkaiah Naidu, were picked by Advani when they were young and have been part of the high command structure for over two decades. Jaitley and Swaraj will turn 62 in 2014 when the next general election is due, while Naidu will be pushing 65.         
	Questions are now being asked about their grassroots support base after all these years. Swaraj is the only one of the three who can claim to have some pan-Indian appeal.         
	What purpose will be served if Naidu becomes the leader in the Rajya Sabha? We had Jaswant Singh in the previous House. How did he help the party? asked an important young BJP leader who did not want to be named. Jaitley, who has the debating skills to fit that role, also lacks in organisational capabilities.         
	These leaders also face opposition from some quarters who view them as part of the team that failed both in 2004 and 2009.         
	A Rajya Sabha MP said: Shouldnt we try to identify a new set of leaders who will be ready to lead the battle in 2014?         
	The BJP has developed a new set of leaders in the states during the last decade  most of them are chief ministers  but not at the national level. Many leaders admit the BJP does not have a team to counter the young Congress army being raised by Rahul Gandhi.                     
	Many of their younger leaders will be hugely experienced in ministerial jobs and administration by 2014, in addition to a good few becoming able parliamentarians. We have almost done nothing to create a new band of Sushma, Jaitley and Naidu. This defeat should be a wake-up call, one BJP office-bearer said.

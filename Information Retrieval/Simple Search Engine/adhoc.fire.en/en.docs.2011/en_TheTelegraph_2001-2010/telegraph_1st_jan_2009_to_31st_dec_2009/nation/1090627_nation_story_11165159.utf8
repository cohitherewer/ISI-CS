                                                                                                               Clashes at Posco site
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, June 26: Tension reigned at the Posco project site today, as supporters and opponents of the mega project fought a pitched battle.        
	Trouble began at Gobindpur village in Jagatsinghpur where most villagers are divided over the South Korean companys proposed steel plant. The residents clashed after a group, claiming to be supporters led by Karunakar Patra, were attacked during a meeting called by project opponents.         
	The supporters were called in by local social activists to restore normality in the village. At least seven persons were injured, one of them seriously.         
	Kujang police station inspector in charge Anil Mishra said cases have been registered against seven accused after an FIR was lodged. No one, however, has been arrested so far. The situation is now under control.        
	The clash incidentally follows the observation of the first death anniversary of Dula Mondal, who was allegedly killed on June 20, 2008, by the pro-project group.         
	On June 20 this year hundreds from Dhinkia, Huagaon and Gadakujang panchayats, opposing the land acquisition bid, had gathered on the seaside near Dhinkia to remember Dula Mondal, under the banner of Posco Pratirodh Sangram Samiti (PPSS) and vowed not to give an inch of their land.        
	The PPSS had further observed June 22 as Black Day, the day when four years ago Posco had signed an MoU with the state government to set up a 12MT steel plant near Paradip at an investment of Rs 51,000 crore.         
	People from 15 villages have been opposing land acquisition from the area, saying it would take away their homes and livelihood.        
	As a part of the agitation, villagers had blocked the approach road to Dhinkia, Nuagaon and Gadakujang and constructed gates and barricades to prevent police and government officials to enter in the areas. Posco needs 4,004 acres, out of which 438 acres are private lands.

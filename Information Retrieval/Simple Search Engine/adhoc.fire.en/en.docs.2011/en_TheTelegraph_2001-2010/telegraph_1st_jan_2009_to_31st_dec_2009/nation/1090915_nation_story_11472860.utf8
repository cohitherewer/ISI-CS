  - Project in place to assist industry          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Emission mess                                        
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 14: As resource-rich Orissa heads for industrialisation, the government, with support of the DFID and the Unido, has focused on adoption of clean development mechanism technology to reduce green house emissions.        
	The state is no stranger to global warming and climate change, and any small fluctuation in weather conditions wreaks havoc in the state made vulnerable by its geographical location.        
	For more than a decade now, Orissa, known as a temperate region, has been experiencing unprecedented rise in temperature and natural calamities such as heat waves, super cyclones, droughts and floods, which have claimed more than 30,000 lives.         
	Environmentalists attribute green house effect to the growing vulnerability.        
	The state has so far signed 70 MoUs with industrial houses to set up steel, aluminium, power and cement plant, which will add to green house emission.        
	To combat this, Orissa has launched Industrial Policy Resolution Technical Assistance Programme, funded by DFID through Unido, in order to provide required institutional and legal support to initiatives trying to assist industrial growth and improve the climate.        
	Under this programme, Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), a project-based market mechanism to leverage capital from the developed nations to reduce emissions in developing countries, has been put in place in Orissa.        
	A CDM cell has been created in Industrial Promotion and Investment Corporation Limited, a nodal agency for the programme, with the DFID funding it and with technical backup being provided by CTRAN, a leading carbon asset management company.        
	UNIDOs national expert and managing director of CTRAN Counselling Ashok Kumar Singha said since past year only five industries in Orissa had availed of the benefit that allows developed countries to generate carbon credit (certified carbon emission reductions) in developing countries. This year as many as 53 industries have taken the benefits, he said.        
	Industries and steel and mines minister Raghunath Mohanty today called upon the upcoming industries adopt the CDM technology to ensure cleaner production, while inaugurating a national workshop.        
	The workshop was attended by more than 200 participants including representatives from industrial houses, academics and experts.

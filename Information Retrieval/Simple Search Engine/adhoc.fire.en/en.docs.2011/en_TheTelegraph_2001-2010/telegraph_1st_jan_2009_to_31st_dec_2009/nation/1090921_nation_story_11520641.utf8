The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Feud in BJP after poll drubbing
                                                                                                               Feud in BJP after poll drubbing
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Sept. 20: While victory has given a boost to the RJD-LJP combination ahead of the Assembly polls, failure has led to infighting in the NDA ranks, particularly among BJP members.        
	The party is showing symptoms plaguing its central leadership in New Delhi. BJP leader and partys Nawada MP Bhola Prasad Singh said: Results show that the party is dead in Bihar and its leadership ineffective.         
	Singh, whose BJP won two of its 18 seats, attacked Nitish Kumar and his government, holding them responsible for the defeat. The government is spending money on unproductive work, he said, adding: Irrigation projects are in limbo. There is no check on black marketing. People are suffering from inflation.        
	BJP MLA Chandramohan Rai, too, attacked the party leadership. The leadership, including deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi and state party chief Radhamohan Singh, should take responsibility for the defeat, he added.         
	Rai supported Singh suggesting that the party should immediately call a meeting of its MPs and cadre to examine its shortcomings. Chandramohan Rai added that while Congress was emerging from nothing, BJP was headed towards nothing.         
	The Congress won two seats against BJPs two in the recently concluded bypolls.         
	Senior BJP leader Birkeshwar Rai was more in favour for outside support to Nitish Kumar-led government.        
	On the other hand, LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan who landed here today amid rousing reception from workers said: The LJP-RJD alliance was unbreakable and the two will take on the NDA riddled with corruption and groupism.        
	Toeing the RJD line, Paswan said: The JD(U)-BJP combination won five seats because of Congress infighting before the polls in Bihar. Had the Congress fought along with the RJD-LJP, the NDA would have drawn a blank.        
	Paswan stated that he and Lalu Prasad were working hard to ensure that the Congress joins the secular alliance in Bihar in the next Assembly polls. The secular forces will win three-fourth of the states seats, if the Congress joins the RJD-LJP combination, he remarked.        
	A Mandal messiah of the Nineties, Lalu has now given up his tirade against the so-called upper castes in view of the latters apparent resentment of Nitish Kumars rule, that prefers the Extremely Backward Classes and Mahadalits over them.        
	We will not differentiate between castes and will treat all equally. Our party will give tickets to all those deserving in Bihar, said Lalu Prasad requesting the people to pardon his party for the mistakes of the past.        
	An experienced campaigner, Lalu, originally a backward class champion, understands the use of playing the upper caste card at a time when the so-called upper castes voters are feeling resentment towards the NDA rule for its EBC promotion and Mahadalit promotion.

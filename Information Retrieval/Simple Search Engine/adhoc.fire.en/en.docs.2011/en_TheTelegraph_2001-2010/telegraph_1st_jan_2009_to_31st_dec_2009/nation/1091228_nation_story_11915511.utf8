          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                          Habib Hussain after landing in India. (Sanket R Jobanputra)                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 27: Air India crew members played Santa Claus to a stowaway on board an international flight on Christmas night  they gave him a blanket and biryani and brought him back home to India where he wanted to be.        
	Moradabad farmer Habib Hussain, 25, was discovered mid-air as he hid in the washroom aboard a special Haj flight from Medina in Saudi Arabia to Jaipur.        
	The crew had two options  to return to the Prince Mohammed bin Abdul Aziz Airport and deplane Habib or to continue the journey to India.        
	Going back to Medina would have meant a mandatory change of crew and the 273 passengers on board would have had to wait for another 12 hours or more. Many of them were elderly and tired after the Haj trip. Besides, Habib looked like he would be better off back home, said a crew member of the flight on the condition of anonymity.        
	The flight commander  considered the supreme authority in such instances under international law  decided to continue the flight after satisfying himself there was no safety or security threat.        
	We knew Habibs was an illegal act. We knew we had taken off from Medina just half an hour back and could very well have returned to the airport. But the young mans distraught pleading melted our hearts. He was certainly not a security threat  we checked him for that. All the passengers sympathised with him. He said he was ready to face the law in India, but he just wanted to get back on home soil, said a senior crew member.        
	Through the day, Rajasthan police interrogated Habib, who has been slapped with a case under the Passport (Entry into India) Act, and appeared to be convinced about his story.        
	We have verified his story and have identified him. So far, whatever he is saying seems to be true, said superintendent of police (East) Biju G. Joseph.         
	Habib was produced before a court in Jaipur, which remanded him in police custody for six days.         
	Clad in his orange overalls, Habib had hid in a washroom till a passenger wanted to use the toilet after take-off. When we found him, he was crouched in a corner of the tiny loo, crying and his hands up. He looked scared and distraught and did not offer any resistance. He answered all our questions  peppering his answers with pleas to be taken back home. Later, we found him a vacant seat, said the crew member.        
	Habib said he had come to Saudi Arabia in June 2009 after paying Rs 1 lakh to an agent. As is the norm with employers there, his passport was taken away. He said he was paid very poorly and irregularly.         
	He said he had to go without food on many days and lived in terrible conditions, sharing a room with 13 others, said the Air India source.        
	The crew member said Habib claimed he had had nothing to eat the whole day. Our flight had taken off from Medina after 6.30pm local time. When we finally served him the biryani on board, he ate with such gusto that we offered him more. Then he slept, said the crew source.        
	Habib, who worked as a contract labourer for a flight handling service company in which the Saudi government holds a stake, had come aboard the Air India plane to clean it at the Medina airport.        
	Usually, handling companies and airport security agencies should check whether their personnel have deplaned before take-off. The handling company goofed up. We have asked for an explanation, said Jitendra Bhargava, executive director, communications, Air India.

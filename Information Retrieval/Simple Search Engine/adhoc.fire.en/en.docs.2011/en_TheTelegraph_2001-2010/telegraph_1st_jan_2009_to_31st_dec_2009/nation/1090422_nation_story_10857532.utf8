                                                                                                               Food bill amp; other PM woes
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, April 21: The Prime Ministers wife and daughters today described the teething problems of VIP life as they stepped out of their shroud of privacy to appear together in a TV interview.        
	Gursharan Kaur told CNN-IBN it was difficult but not very tough to continue her routine after she moved into 7 Race Course Road with her husband.        
	One is now used to it, but I certainly miss my driving and I miss my trips to the Mother Dairy (kiosks) and to the fruits and vegetable markets or whatever, she said. I still try to go out to shop if its shoes or saris.        
	Novelist daughter Daman, married to a police officer, said the first two years were very difficult because of the security and lack of privacy.        
	I was very angry and very bitter in the first year, especially. But the second year was easier. Somewhere towards the end of the second year I was able to rationalise why I was behaving this way and why I was blaming my father for this when it wasnt really his fault, she said.        
	I think I have managed to quite get over with that and I have now become comfortable with the idea that yes, this is what it involves.        
	Congress members close to the Singhs said the family was initially bothered about the demands of protocol and its trappings.        
	Gursharan, for instance, wondered on whose expense account the cavernous kitchen managed to turn out food for so many people every day. She was apparently too nervous to ask her husband, so she put a friend on the job.        
	When she was told the food tab for the family, guests, officials and staff was picked up by the government, she put her foot down and insisted on two separate kitchens: one for the familys exclusive use which they would fund and the other for official purposes.        
	Sources said Daman and Upinder, a history professor with Delhi University and writer of half-a-dozen books, refused to use the official vehicles and were initially chary of using the security till they were told they had no choice.        
	Upinder stressed the daughters were never interested in politics. Daman said her father would be a little nervous if she ever wanted to join politics.        
	Asked what she had missed the most in the past five years, Gursharan said: Most of all spending time with the family. Time to relax. He hasnt had a holiday for the last five years. Many friends have suggested, Why dont you take time off, but there is always so much work, he has no time to. I think he relaxes when he is working.         
	Asked if the Prime Minister ever lost his cool, she said: I am sure he does, but he manages to swallow his anger.

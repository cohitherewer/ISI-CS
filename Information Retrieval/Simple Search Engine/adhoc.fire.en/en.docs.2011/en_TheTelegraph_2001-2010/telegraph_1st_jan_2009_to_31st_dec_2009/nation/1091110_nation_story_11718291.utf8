                                                                                    Tuesday , November 10 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Shakeel slams Nitish stand
          FARHANA KALAM                          Shakeel Ahmed Khan                                  
	Gaya, Nov. 9: Exhorting chief minister Nitish Kumar to snap ties with NDA partners such as BJP and Shiv Sena, deputy leader of the Opposition Shakeel Ahmed Khan has asked Nitish to explain the regional and communal chauvinism being promoted by Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivarj Singh Chauhan.         
	Reacting to Chauhans objectionable statement where he promised jobs for the states people and not for the people of Bihar, Khan said that JD(U)s continued alliance with the BJP will erode the credibility of Nitishs campaign, with has Bihari pride as its theme. Maximum harm is being done to Bihars pride by JD(U)s alliance partners in the NDA, said Khan.        
	Shakeel Ahmed Khan was talking to The Telegraph on Monday morning during his Gaya visit in connection with a programme for the implementation of Sachar Committee recommendations.        
	By merely writing a protest letter, the chief minister can not absolve himself of the responsibility to ensure that the states people are given their due honour and protection in other parts of the country, he added.         
	The deputy leader of the Opposition also came down heavily on the deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi for his attempt to defend the statement. Crores of television viewers have seen and heard the poisonous statement and any attempt to defend Chauhan will be seen as a betrayal of the Bihar cause, said Khan.         
	Raising the anti-constitutional point, Khan, also a senior lawyer of the Patna High Court, said that Shivraj Singh Chauhan had taken an oath to work in accordance with the framework of the Constitution. But, that his statement went against the letter and spirit of the Constitution, which aims to promote harmony and integration through greater interaction between different sections of the population. Chauhan has forfeited his right to continue as the chief minister by violating the constitutional mandate, Khan added.         
	The deputy leader of the Opposition also said that his party would raise the issue in a big way in the winter session of the Bihar Assembly.

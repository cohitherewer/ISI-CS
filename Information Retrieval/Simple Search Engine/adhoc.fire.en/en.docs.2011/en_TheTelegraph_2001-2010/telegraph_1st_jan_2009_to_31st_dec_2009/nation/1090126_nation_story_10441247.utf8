	New Delhi, Jan. 25: An event to showcase the countrys military might, the Republic Day parade organised by the ministry of defence often features the armed forces latest acquisitions in firepower and hardware.         
	However, this years parade will feature tableaux of the INS Jalashva, the Indian Navy vessel acquired from the US, the British-origin Hawk Advanced Jet Trainer Aircraft, and a scaled-down model of the Israeli Phalcon Awacs  each an example of tardy and faulty procurement.         
	If these are the acquisitions designed to give ballast to New Delhis policy of coercive diplomacy against Pakistan  that threatens act, or else...  the security establishment will have a lot of reforms to undertake before its muscle-flexing can be taken seriously.         
	The acquisition of a single Phalcon (contracted in March 2004) by this time would have given the military a boost when sabre-rattling after the Mumbai attacks has also meant a re-assessment of the conventional military capabilities of India and Pakistan.         
	The Phalcon is designed to give the air force the ability for surveillance over a 400km radius. An Awacs flying over, say, Amritsar, would be able to observe the movement of aircraft, ground assets and military machines inside Pakistan for up to 300km.         
	Its command and control system would then be able to transmit the signals to Indian air and ground assets  from within Indian airspace  that would have the time to observe and prepare a response.         
	The Phalcon Airborne Early Warning and Control System (AWACS)  referred to as the Indian Air Forces eye in the sky  will be exhibited in the parade, though the aircraft are not yet in the Indian inventory.        
	Denying a report that the first of three AWACS had quietly landed in Delhi earlier this month, the air force spokesperson had said it was a policy to be open about the acquisition of such a major asset and it was not in the forces interest to keep it hidden.         
	The first AWACS  with its distinctive radome (dome-like shell used to house a radar antenna) mounted on a Uzbek-made Ilyushion 76 aircraft  was expected in November 2007. It is now likely only towards the end of next month  a delay of more than 14 months.         
	Israels Elta Systems and the Israeli Aircraft Industry are involved in mounting the radar and equipping the aircraft with electronic intelligence and communication intelligence systems under a $1.1 billion three-way (India, Uzbekistan and Israel) deal signed in March 2004.         
	The acquisition has been delayed apparently because the aircraft-building facility in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, could not deliver the airframe to the Israelis in time.         
	The third Phalcon is now expected only in 2011 and India has already signed a contract for three more.         
	Jalashva, the second-largest ship in the Indian Navys fleet after the aircraft carrier Viraat (now in dock for long-term repairs) was in the Arabian Sea last week, where it participated in offensive drills to train a newly-converted army amphibious brigade to beach in hostile territory.         
	However, the navys ability to use the Jalashva in actual offensive operations such as a war remains doubtful after the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) last year pointed to serious flaws in the way it was contracted.         
	Senior officials, from defence minister A.K. Antony to navy chief Admiral Sureesh Mehta, have asserted that it is up to the navy to decide how and when it will use the Jalashva with its six embarked SH-60 helicopters that cost around $50 million (Rs 202 crore).         
	The Jalashva, which was the USS Trenton in its earlier avatar, is a 30-year-old vessel. In its report last March, the CAG said the navy had accepted a restrictive clause in the terms for its purchase and doubted how it could be used in the event of hostilities.         
	Restrictive clauses raise doubts about the real advantages from this deal. For example, restrictions on the offensive deployment of the ship and permission to the foreign government to conduct an inspection and inventory of all articles transferred under the End-Use monitoring clause of the Letter of Agreement (LOA). Given that the ship is of old vintage, Indian Navy would remain dependent upon foreign-based support, the auditors wrote.         
	The Indian Air Force is also planning to display its latest acquisition, the Hawk Advanced Jet Trainer. The force is justifiably proud of it, not so much for its capabilities but because it was finally able to get the aircraft nearly a quarter-century after articulating the demand for it.         
	British Aerospace began deliveries of the Hawk 132 for the Indian Air Force in late 2007 and the aircraft were inducted in February 2008.         
	The cost of the 66 aircraft was over Rs 6,000 crore when the deal was signed in March 2004. The Hawk fills a crucial gap in the training of fighter pilots as they graduate from the subsonic Kiran Mark 11 aircraft to the supersonic combat aircraft.         
	So much for the air force and the navy, when their mean machines roll down Rajpath this Republic Day. The army, which will display radars and its armour, will be eloquent with its dissatisfaction over crucial missing component in its arsenal  the big guns. Army chief General Deepak Kapoor had pointed out this month that not a single cannon had been acquired since the Bofors in 1986.

          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 6: The Supreme Court today quickly rid itself of a probe report that indicts the agitating Tamil Nadu lawyers for behaving like hooligans and miscreants.        
	The apex court, which had itself ordered the probe following last months lawyer-police clash at Madras High Court, appeared unwilling to aggravate the situation in Tamil Nadu where lawyers have boycotted courts for about a month. It referred the report to the state government and the high court for appropriate action.        
	With this, former judge B.N. Srikrishna, who had submitted the report yesterday, appears jinxed. His report into the 1992 Mumbai riots  which indicted the Shiv Sena and policemen -- was so politically explosive that no government in Maharashtra has had the guts to implement them since 1998.        
	In this report, he has slammed police for using disproportionate force and the lawyers for boycotting courts over a political issue and provoking the clashes. He has accused the acting high court chief justice of soft-pedalling on the lawyers strike, allowing it to go out of hand.        
	The lawyers had begun the boycott in support of Tamils in Sri Lanka, thrown eggs at a politician for anti-LTTE remarks, and then fought with the police to prevent colleagues arrest.

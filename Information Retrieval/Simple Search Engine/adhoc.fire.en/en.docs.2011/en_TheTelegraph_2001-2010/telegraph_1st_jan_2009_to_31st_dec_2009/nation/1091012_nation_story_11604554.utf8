  - Rahul buzz swirls around Rohit, the scion of Tilak family        SATISH NANDGAONKAR                          Lokmanya Tilaks great-great-grandson Rohit with wife Pranati                                              
	Pune, Oct. 11: As you pass through the imposing four-foot-wide mahogany door of Punes Kesari Wada, the old sepia-coloured faade of the left wall gradually changes into a freshly painted one as if shedding its skin. It resembles the change in one of Maharashtras political families.        
	The large courtyard of the more-than-century-old mansion, where Lokmanya Tilak set up Kesari, a Marathi newspaper that spearheaded the fight for independence, leads to the plush air-conditioned office of his great-great-grandson and Congress candidate from Kasba Peth, Rohit Tilak.        
	Rohit, 30, grandson of Jayantrao Tilak, former chairperson of the legislative council and Lokmanya Tilaks grandson, hopes to one day join the ranks of the partys next-generation leaders led by Rahul Gandhi and including the likes of Jyotiraditya Scindia, Jitin Prasada, Sachin Pilot and Sandeep Dikshit.        
	The MBA and general manager of the Kesari Group of Publications (as well as the newspapers digital edition) could soon make the list if Raj Thackerays spoiler candidate helps him upset the BJP in its Brahmin bastion. Rohit is pitted against the BJPs Girish Bapat, who has won the seat thrice in a row since 1995.        
	The BJP has won six times from this Brahmin-dominated constituency since 1967. In 1985, the seat went to the Congress but was wrested by the BJPs Anna Joshi in 1991. In 1995, Bapat established his stranglehold on the constituency and has since then defeated Nationalist Congress Party candidates in 1999 and 2004.        
	The Congress staked claim to the NCP seat this time and decided to field a fresh face. Many believe that Rahul Gandhi played a key role in the candidature of Rohit, a fifth-generation Tilak in politics just as Rahul is a fifth-generation Nehru-Gandhi.        
	Rohits wife Pranati, however, is reluctant to say if the nomination came from the Rahul quota.        
	It would not be proper for me to comment on this, she said. Rohit has been engaged actively in the social and political fields for the past 10 to 15 years. He has been working hard in this constituency for the past two years and wanted to contest the election.        
	Rahul had handpicked young candidates for the Lok Sabha polls and most of them won. He had surely watched Rohit rise through the ranks of the National Students Union (NSUI) of India and the Youth Congress.        
	Rohit started out as general secretary of the NSUIs Kasba Peth unit in 1998-99 and rose to become general secretary and then president of the student bodys state unit. In 2006, he was chosen the best among the NSUIs state presidents and received an award from Sonia Gandhi. He is now national co-ordinator of the Youth Congress.        
	Young is the buzzword in his constituency. The courtyard outside his office bustles with young volunteers, on bikes decorated with Congress flags, gearing for yet another rally.         
	Unlike his rivals, Rohit has been targeting young voters in Pune through his personal website as well as popular online platforms like blogs, YouTube, Facebook, Orkut and Twitter. Do you think the state of politics will change if you give younger candidates a chance? readers are asked on his personal website.        
	We are telling our voters that we belong to an educated and cultured family who would like to bring about a systemic change that would benefit everyone. We have the Tilak legacy to carry forward, so give us a chance, Pranati said.        
	She has campaigned actively with her husband, who spent the last lap of electioneering, which ended this evening, doing padyatras and rallies.        
	Although many see the election as a straight fight between Bapat and Rohit, the presence of the Maharashtra Navnirman Senas Ravindra Dhangekar, one of the partys six corporators in Pune, could divide the saffron votes. A senior Congress leader, Narayan Chavan, is also in the fray as an Independent.        
	Another factor in Rohits favour is Bapats steadily decreasing vote share. In 1995, he polled 53,043 votes, followed by 39,419 in 1999 and 38,160 in 2004 in a constituency of 3.18 lakh voters.        
	One of the key issues in this constituency is development and preservation of the century-old heritage of the wadas or large mansions, such as Kesari Wada, which houses a museum of Lokmanyas artefacts and a famous Ganesh idol installed by the freedom fighter.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Nitin slips into Rahuls boot 
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Nitin slips into Rahuls boot 
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                          Nitin Gadkari addresses a media conference in New Delhi on Thursday.                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 24: Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ideologue M.G. Vaidya had asked Nitin Gadkari to learn from communists Prakash Karat and Harkishan Singh Surjeet. The new BJP chief has, instead, taken a leaf out of Rahul Gandhis book.        
	He isnt yet thinking of breaking bread with Dalits or sleeping in their homes. But like Rahul, who has broken with the Congresss feudal traditions of wearing garlands and having his feet touched, the BJP chief wants to do away with the chatoogiri (boot-licking) culture in his party, leading by example.        
	Our slogan of a party with a difference should mean what it says. Distinctiveness. No cut-outs, he said today at his first news conference in Delhi.        
	When I was the Maharashtra BJP president and a minister, nobody came to see me off or receive me at the airport. In Delhi, I was told I should wear kurta-pyjama. I am most comfortable in clothes Im used to wearing (a tweed coat with a polo-neck sweater and woollen trousers). I dont want my feet to be touched, or to be garlanded.        
	Those who insisted on paying floral tributes were advised to put the cash equivalent in a kitty Gadkari would place in the BJP office to help the families of the farmers who had committed suicide in Vidarbha.        
	Gadkari, at 52 the youngest ever BJP president, has created a buzz that an era has indeed ended.        
	This generation change could be substantive, a party official said, adding that like Rahul, Gadkari was combining a managerial approach to politics with NGO-like concerns.        
	To me, politics is without a personal agenda. It is an instrument for ushering in socio-economic reforms. I am a management, commerce and law graduate. Although my business had do with concrete and cement, I must confess I am not an expert in concrete, Gadkari said.        
	Among the priorities he listed were expanding the BJPs vote base, infusing confidence among the minorities and restoring team spirit, mutual trust and discipline.        
	I told my colleagues they have a right to criticise me but in my presence. I can either convince them or be convinced myself because I dont believe in protocol, Gadkari said.        
	He showed little patience with indiscipline and below-par performance: Indiscipline is not a subject for discussion but for execution. It will not be tolerated.        
	He added: I can do away with financial audit once in a while but performance audit is a must.        
	Gadkari had provided an example of his penchant for quick action last evening, when he was up against factionalism in Rajasthan. He said he had asked senior leaders, including Arun Jaitley and Rajnath Singh, drop all engagements and find a solution.        
	In six or seven hours we found one. The state leaders resolved to fight the panchayat polls unitedly, he said.        
	Sources said the please-all solution would ensure that everyone, Vasundhara Raje included, got a fair deal that will not block their aspirations.

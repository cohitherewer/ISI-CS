	 New Delhi: If elections are the pride of India, there is greater pride in having the world watch the spectacle.          
	The government is working on plans to turn the one-month long-election exercise, and the campaign that leads up to the voting, into a unique tourist attraction. The move is being steered by the tourism ministry, desperate to ensure the tourism industry recovers from the double whammy of the Mumbai attack and recession.          
	Indian elections are the largest and, perhaps, the longest celebration of democracy. No election anywhere else in the world matches ours in vibrancy, colour and spirit. Then why not market it? said a ministry official.          
	According to him, such tours will be an experience of a lifetime for foreigners who can see first hand how the worlds largest democracy goes about its election.           
	The idea is said to have already captured the imagination of tour operators in the West. Elections have to be packaged in the right format and we are in the process of doing that. It (such showcasing of polls) holds great promise for the tourism sector, the official said.          
	The poll package could include meetings with star contestants and visits to campaigns and rallies. These may be interspersed with trips to regular tourist spots.          
	Brochures with details of elections in India are being prepared and will be handed out to overseas hotel operators and travel agents the ministry is in touch with.          
	The plan also appears well timed: the polls this time are being held during April and May, the lean season for tourists. If everything works according to plan, we may turn the dry season into a fruitful one, the official said.           
	Efforts are on to get international and domestic airlines to participate in the election-season hardsell, with the ministry planning to urge them to consider offering a companion-free ticket for every booking made.          
	According to the official, Kerala has already made a start with election tourism. Tour operators in the state had marketed the 2004 general election. The results were amazing: tourists, especially westerners, arrived in big numbers.           
	Some candidates had addressed crowds in English when they saw foreign visitors, the official said.           
	Elsewhere in the world, the administration in the Indonesian island of Bali, a tourist hotspot, has also marketed its election to great success, the official said.

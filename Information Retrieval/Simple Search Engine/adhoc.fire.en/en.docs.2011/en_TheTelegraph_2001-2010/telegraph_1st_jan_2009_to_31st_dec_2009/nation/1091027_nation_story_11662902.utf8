The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | BJP finds House weapon, slams PM
                                                                                                               BJP finds House weapon, slams PM
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	New Delhi, Oct. 26: The BJP today attacked the Centre and the Prime Minister over an alleged cover-up of Indias largest scam and indicated it would make the spectrum scandal in the telecom ministry a major issue in Parliament next month.        
	Arun Jaitley said the alleged irregularities in the allocation of spectrum to new operators had cost the exchequer over Rs 60,000 crore, and described this as the largest scam in independent India in terms of monetary value.        
	The BJP, reeling from serial poll defeats and infighting, is apparently trying to reclaim the high moral ground it had taken in the 80s and 90s on issues such as Bofors and Harshad Mehta.        
	Jaitley accused Manmohan Singh of exonerating communications minister A. Raja although investigations were on, and wondered why he should send such a signal to the investigative agencies directly under him.        
	Singh, asked about the accusations against Rajas ministry, whose offices have been raided by the CBI, had yesterday said: In a democracy, charges are traded but that does not mean what the Opposition is saying is right.        
	Jaitley, leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, told a news conference today: The fact that the minister belongs to an alliance partner (the DMK) of the UPA could not be a ground for a cover-up operation. I dont think the PM should have intervened.        
	After Parliament reconvenes on November 19, the BJP will try to co-ordinate with the Left and the rest of the Opposition in attacking the government, BJP sources said.        
	The sources, however, were unsure if the party could motivate the Opposition given the reluctance of the Left, Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party to be seen openly in the BJPs company.        
	Besides, the Left may not wish to alienate the DMK given Jayalalithaas failure to recover after two successive defeats and the proximity of the Tamil Nadu Assembly elections, due in 2011.        
	In December 1995, the entire Opposition had put the Narasimha Rao government on the mat and stalled Parliament over another telecom scam involving the then minister, Sukh Ram.        
	Jaitley asked for Rajas resignation, saying his continuation in that ministry is itself a deterrent to an honest and independent investigation.        
	He warned that the probe should not end up fixing culpability only on civil servants. It was the minister who is the prime accused, and the civil servants were only carrying out his dictates, he said.        
	The BJP leader narrated the circumstances leading to the scam. He said that in 2007, when an open licence regime was recommended, the telecom department set two deadlines for receiving applications, one official and the other artificial. The applications received after the artificial date were rejected to allegedly favour friendly applicants who were mostly real estate companies.        
	This is not the Oppositions charge as the PM has commented. It is now a judgment of Delhi High Court which has (in April) quashed the fixation of these cutoff dates, Jaitley said. His other charge was that the licences to the nine selected operators were given away at a price fixed in an auction in 2001, not the 2007 market value.

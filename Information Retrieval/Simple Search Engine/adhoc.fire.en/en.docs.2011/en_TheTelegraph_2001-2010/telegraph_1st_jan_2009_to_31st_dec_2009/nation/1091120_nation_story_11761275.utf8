          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 19: The Opposition today stalled House proceedings for the day demanding that the Assembly first condole the death of farmers due to crop failure and debt burden.        
	The Opposition members stormed the well shouting slogans such as chashi amar rahe (long live farmers), forcing the adjournment till 5pm.        
	As soon as the Assembly met this morning, leader of Opposition Bhupinder Singh and Congress members rose to raise the issue. However, Speaker Pradip Kumar Amat asked members to wait till the question hour was over and called higher education minister Debi Prasad Mishra to reply to a listed question.        
	Infuriated, Opposition members trooped into Well and disrupted proceedings, forcing the Speaker to adjourn the business till 11.30 am.

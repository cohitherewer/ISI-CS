The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Tight security, vigil before bypolls
                                                                                                               Tight security, vigil before bypolls
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT       
	Patna, Sept. 14: The government has decided to deploy armed paramilitary forces in and around all 2,620 polling booths at 11 Assembly constituencies going to bypolls tomorrow.        
	We will ensure that the second phase is as peaceful as the first, said the additional director-general of police headquarters Neelmani.         
	Unlike previous Lok Sabha elections, this time chief minister Nitish Kumar, spearheading the NDA campaign, is fighting a two-pronged poll battle. He has to fight rebels who have fielded nominees against JD(U) candidates and the political rivals  Opposition RJD-LJP combination on one hand and Congress on the other.        
	Probably, for the first time during his four years of tenure, Nitish has party MPs hoping for defeat of official nominees to support family members who are in the fray as Independents. Jagdish Sharma, JD(U)s Jehanabad MP, and Purnamasi Ram, JD(U) Gopalganj MP, have fielded wife and son, respectively.        
	Observers believe that if Nitish wins against all odds, he will emerge as the darling of party cadre who may see a chance to improve in the party.        
	The chief minister has tried to drive home his fight against nepotism. Nitish disowned family members of JD(U) leaders both in Jehanabad and Bagaha. I will not promote my son if he is in politics. Nobody knows that I have three brothers-in-law. I have an extended family and that includes all the nine crore people in this state.        
	While the RJD-LJP has had a relatively quiet campaign, Congress has been more than active bringing in star campaigners such as Salman Khurshid and Sachin Pilot in an apparent bid to revive the Congress in the state.         
	But, the battle seems, yet again, is locked between the NDA-and the RJD-LJP combination with the NDA enjoying a clear edge, thanks to its Lok Sabha performance.         
	Constituencies going to polls are Bagha, Nautan, Begusarai, Triveniganj, Simri Bakhtiarpur, Araria, Dhoraiya, Munger, Fulwari, Ghosi and Bodh Gaya.

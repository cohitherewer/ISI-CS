          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Srinagar, April 13: Farooq Abdullah today agreed to contest from Srinagar on persuasion from National Conference leaders but kept options open for a last-minute change of mind.        
	I will file the nomination papers for the Srinagar seat. The party has selected a person who would take my place in the Rajya Sabha if I am voted to the Lok Sabha, Abdullah said.        
	But the party, keeping the possibility of his pullout in mind, announced that a second candidate, party leader and Srinagar mayor Salman Sagar, would also file a nomination.         
	He (Abdullah) was reluctant but senior leaders persuaded him, a source said.

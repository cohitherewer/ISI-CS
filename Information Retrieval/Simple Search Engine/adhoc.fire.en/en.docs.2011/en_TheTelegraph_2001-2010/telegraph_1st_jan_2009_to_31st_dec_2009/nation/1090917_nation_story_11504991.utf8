The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Cabinet to take up NIT plan today
                                                                                                               Cabinet to take up NIT plan today
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 16: The Union cabinet is likely to approve tomorrow 10 new National Institutes of Technology, including one each in six north-eastern states that at present do not host any NIT.         
	Top government sources confirmed that the cabinet was scheduled to consider the 10 promised NITs at its meeting tomorrow.         
	The cabinet may also consider the foreign education providers bill to allow and regulate the entry of foreign universities in India.         
	The bill was passed by the cabinet under the previous UPA regime but could not be introduced in Parliament because of opposition from the Left, which was then supporting the government.         
	The UPA no longer depends on the Left for its survival but cabinet procedure requires that the Prime Ministers council take another look at the bill since a new government is in place.         
	The promised NITs are seen as non-controversial  and likely to be approved tomorrow without too many hiccups.         
	The 10 beneficiary states will be Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Sikkim, Delhi, Uttarakhand, Goa and Puducherry.         
	The proposal, if cleared, may not be officially announced tomorrow because of the model code of conduct in place for Assembly elections in Arunachal  one of the beneficiary states.         
	The UPA had first promised the 10 new institutes under the 11th five-year plan in 2007.         
	Human resource development ministry sources, however, admitted that the cabinet may wish to scrutinise the foreign universities bill more deeply than the plan to start 10 new NITs.

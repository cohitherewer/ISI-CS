          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           A woman at a flu screening in Delhi. (Reuters)                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 6: Some of Indias flu screening and testing centres today began experiencing the strain of the new guidelines that ask all patients with flu symptoms to get themselves assessed at designated government hospitals.         
	The health ministry has asked states to increase the number of hospitals that patients can visit for clinical evaluation and possible quarantine if they are found infected with the H1N1 virus.         
	We had asked the states to expand capacity with additional hospitals several weeks ago as part of general preparedness and weve asked them again, a health ministry official said. A fresh list of designated centres may be released within a day or two.         
	Three designated hospitals  in Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad  today encountered a spurt in the number of people walking in with fever, sore throat and cough.        
	At Kasturba Hospital in Mumbai, at least 80 people sought clinical evaluation  a 16-fold rise from the average of about five a day last week, hospital sources said. Theres clearly a panic reaction here, a doctor said.         
	The Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases in Bangalore received at least 100 patients. Last week, the institute had received about 10 to 15 persons each day requesting H1N1 diagnosis, sources said. Weve taken 90 throat swab samples, a senior doctor said. Hyderabads Chest Diseases Hospital also received about twice the usual number of requests for H1N1 diagnosis.        
	The number of laboratory confirmed cases of H1N1 in India today climbed to 615 with 19 new cases. Eleven of them picked up the infection locally from previously infected persons.         
	Saudi Arabia has asked Haj pilgrims to provide health certificates showing that they have received flu shots, says PTI.

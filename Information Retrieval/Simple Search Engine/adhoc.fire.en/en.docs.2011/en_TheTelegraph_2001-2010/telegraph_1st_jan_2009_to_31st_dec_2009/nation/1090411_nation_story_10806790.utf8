	Fatehpur (Uttar Pradesh), April 10 (PTI): A fire broke out in the Howrah-bound Kalka Mail today, leading to minor injuries to some passengers who jumped out in panic.        
	When the train arrived at Fatehpur station, smoke was seen coming out of the bogey next to the engine and the coach was detached, railway sources said. But some passengers jumped out in panic.        
	The flames were brought under control in three hours and the train left for Howrah. Assistant station master Rajiv Lochan said the cause of the fire would be known only after an inquiry. Traffic on the Delhi-Howrah line was disrupted for a few hours.

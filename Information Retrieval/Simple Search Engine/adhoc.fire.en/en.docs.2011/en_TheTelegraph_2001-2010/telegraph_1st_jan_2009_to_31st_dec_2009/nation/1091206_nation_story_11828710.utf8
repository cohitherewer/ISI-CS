	New Delhi, Dec. 5: Modifications being proposed to a law to regulate foreign universities include a proposal to exempt them from inspections by the University Grants Commission (UGC) or its successor.        
	According to the earlier draft, the UGC or its successor  the proposed National Commission for Higher Education and Research  had powers to inspect foreign institutions.        
	Under the draft before a committee of secretaries, Indian regulators will no longer have the power to inspect foreign institutions. But it will be mandatory for foreign institutions to disclose details of their fees and admission process.        
	The earlier draft named the Centre as the appellate authority to which foreign institutions could complain. Under the new draft, education tribunals  proposed under a separate law  will act as appellate authorities.        
	Since the bill specifies that all other domestic Indian laws will be applicable to these institutions, clauses referring to national security interests and linguistic sensitivities are being dropped from the earlier draft.

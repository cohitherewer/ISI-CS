	Bhubaneswar, April 20: He had won the Bhubaneswar Assembly seat with record margins of 94,555 and 85,788 votes, respectively, in the 2000 and 2004 elections.        
	But, with the break in the 11-year-old BJP-BJD alliance veteran BJP leader and former industries minister in the Naveen Patnaik government Biswa Bhusan Harichandan has now found himself on a sticky wicket as he fights for his fourth term.        
	Harichandan, who fought the past two elections as a BJD-BJP candidate, is fighting it alone and facing a formidable challenge from former partner BJD.        
	The 75-year-old politician, known for his indomitable fighting spirit, however, has been putting up a brave front. Bhubaneswars voters have elected me for three consecutive terms since 1996. Once, they elected me on a BJP ticket, he reminds the reporter.         
	Harichandan has pinned his hopes on the politically-conscious voters of Bhubaneswar who he believes generally do not appreciate Congress. A lesson will be taught to Naveen Patnaik for his betrayal and former strengthening Congresss chances of coming back to power.         
	The old war horse who has been in electoral politics since 1977 and has been elected to the Assembly five times (twice earlier from the Chilika Assembly seat), said: I am cent per cent sure of my (Bhubaneswar) people.         
	As his case, he highlights on the development works undertaken by him in the past 10 years for the city and especially looks forth to receiving the full support of the legal community as he is a former lawyer. His optimism also stems from the fact that two of his major contenders  Bijoy Mohanty of the BJD and Alok Jena of the Congress  are new faces.        
	Mohanty also claims to be enjoying the support of government employees and slum-dwellers, constituting a large chunk of the electorate.         
	However, slum residents, numbering to around 1.5 lakh and more, have traditionally been BJD supporters because of the governments pro-poor policies and programmes. We used to vote for Biju babu and now we will vote for his son Naveen babu, said Sania Jena of Buddhanagar slum. Hence, election here may boil down to a ghost fight between Naveen and Harichandan.         
	Meanwhile, mayor Ananta Jena and 17 corporator colleagues are campaigning vigorously for Bijoy Mohanty after the BJD swept the recent Bhubaneswar civic polls.         
	Congresss Alok Jena, the former president of Utkal University Students Union, is also trying to mobilise the support of youths and slum-dwellers. Jena has promised to replicate the Shiela Dixit model of development in Bhubaneswar, if he is elected.        
	Much to Harichandans discomfort, former finance minister Panchanan Kanungo is contesting on a Samrudhha Odisha ticket.        
	Party rebel Jagannath Pradhan, who is contesting as an Independent, has also queered Harichandans pitch further. Pradhan, a former corporator, is trying to cash in on the dissidence among party cadre and split party votes.

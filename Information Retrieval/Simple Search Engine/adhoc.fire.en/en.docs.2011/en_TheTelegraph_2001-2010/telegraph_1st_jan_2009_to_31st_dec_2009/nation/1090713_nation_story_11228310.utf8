The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | India changes Pak tune, nudged by US
                                                                                                               India changes Pak tune, nudged by US
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                           Manmohan Singh                                  
	New Delhi, July 12: From accusing Pakistans ISI of collusion with the Mumbai mayhem plotters  they have been spoofing Thuraya phone locations of terrorists  to revealing direct conversations with ISI boss Lt General Ahmed Shuja Pasha, the Indian tenor on its sibling-rival has swung from shrill to nearly sonorous over the past week.         
	The Pakistani establishment has taken fairly satisfactory steps in the last few days in the direction of acting against the guilty, top government sources told The Telegraph today, referring to the announcement in Islamabad yesterday that the trial of those guilty, including Jamaat-ud-Dawa terror mastermind Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, would start within a week. We can probably say Pakistan is not in denial anymore that the Mumbai attack was launched from its soil.         
	New Delhis change of tone is dramatic enough to validate that rare thing called optimism in the Indo-Pak context over the coming week as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his apex team prepare to engage with counterparts on the ringside of the NAM summit at Sharm-al-Sheikh in Egypt.         
	The Prime Minister leaves for Paris tomorrow where he will be chief guest at the Bastille Day parade on July 14; he heads for the NAM meet immediately after the historic parade, led this year by an Indian armed forces contingent, concludes.         
	The jagged history of India-Pakistan relations suggests that both sides be fairly relied upon to blow any opportunity of improvement in ties; the saving grace may be that there are external factors pressing both sides to end belligerent brinkmanship on the subcontinent  infamously labelled the most dangerous place on earth after India and Pakistan exploded nuclear devices in 1998  and return to the negotiating table.         
	The US has been the main driver of resumption of dialogue, although the EU too has quietly played its part. We have had to work on both India and Pakistan for resuming talks, and our perception is we will have to persist with our persuasion, a western diplomat based in Delhi said. The critical issue is that Pakistan must act on the evidence emerging from the Mumbai strike, but equally, India must remain open to talking, closing doors does not help.         
	While Pakistan has had to be goaded out of its denial over the real actors behind the Mumbai terror attack, the Americans have consistently been pushing India over past months to not reject dialogue. The evidence of US-led orchestrations is visible, even though India and Pakistan have taken a rough roller-coaster ride to the talking chambers.         
	US Afpak envoy Richard Holbrookes begin talking mission to the subcontinent in May, the breaking of freeze between Singh and Asif Ali Zardari at Yekaterinburg last month, and in July a flurry of concerted moves on both sides that actually triggered expectations of a positive outcome from the Manmohan Singh-Yousaf Raza Gilani summit in Egypt next week. Foreign secretaries Shiv Shankar Menon and Salman Bashir are expected to meet ahead of that summit and prepare ground.         
	And even though India maintains Pakistan needs to do much more before the composite dialogue can resume, there is a radically new willingness in South Block to push ahead with talks at various levels; India was bluntly rejecting any dialogue with Pakistan till just a few weeks back.         
	The rejectionists, sources say, are still there in the PMO and the foreign policy establishment, arguing that any resumption will mean the end of pressure on Pakistan to act on the Mumbai attack. But this hard line has increasingly lost validity in recent weeks to what can really be described as common sense.         
	As one senior bureaucrat put it: It isnt as if we were getting any yield from Pakistan by not talking, on the other hand, we were being seen in the international community as blocking avenues to ease tensions. As the Prime Minister has said, India cannot choose its neighbours, we have to keep talking.         
	But there is another, more important, factor that has pushed India into talks  Pakistans quick and clever compliance with western diktat that instead of cutting deals with them, it fight off the Taliban in the Swat region.        
	 After the fairly effective action the Pakistanis took in Swat, they really got the Americans and most of the West on their side, their priorities are Swat and Afghanistan, they were not really listening to India any more unless we were prepared to talk, said the official.         
	Talking to Pakistan is really a no-loss gain for us, nobody is saying we cannot continue to complain about lack of Pakistani action against terrorists just because we are talking. In fact, we can use that platform to put across our views more effectively. At least we are headed somewhere now. Sharm-al-Sheikh should provide more definite clues to where.         
	It had better be some place more convivial because US secretary of state Hillary Clinton is scheduled on the subcontinent less than 10 days from now.

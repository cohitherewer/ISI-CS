The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Maoists kidnap Hindalco officials
                                                                                                               Maoists kidnap Hindalco officials
          AMIT GUPTA                          Hindalco mines in Kujam, Jharkhand                                  
	Ranchi, Aug. 18: Suspected Maoists kidnapped a Hindalco Industries engineer and nine employees before returning to torch vehicles and machinery in Jharkhand yesterday in a double strike that police said could be the work of a breakaway faction.        
	South Chhotanagpur deputy inspector-general R.K. Mallick, who is camping in extremist stronghold Bishunpur, Gumla, where the rebels descended on the Kujam bauxite mines, said a CPI (Maoist) splinter group may be trying to make its presence felt.        
	We have learnt that the Hindalco employees are safe and are trying to locate them, the DIG added.        
	Gumla deputy commissioner Rahul Sharma, too, said a breakaway Maoist faction could be involved in the abduction of the Aditya Birla group company employees. We are very close to finding out where the rebels are keeping the Hindalco men. Some employees called up their families to say they were still safe. We will mount pressure on the rebel group to ensure their safe release.        
	Sources said 20-30 armed rebels descended on the bauxite reserve on the Netarhat-Kujam road yesterday morning and whisked away mining engineer Vijay Kumar, a resident of Jodhpur, three supervisors, five contractors and a driver.        
	Some 12 hours later, around 9pm, they returned to torch as many as 12 heavy equipment and vehicles on the mine premises. Senior police officers are not ruling out a possible demand for levy from the company.        
	Hindalco vice-president (mines) K.K. Dave said engineer Kumar and the supervisors, Md Shahjada, K.P. Singh and Devendra Kumar, were travelling by two jeeps with the five contractors when they were stopped.        
	They were intercepted on the Netarhat-Kujam road around 9am. The kidnap took place before the rebels barged into the mine premises and torched nine dumpers, two water tankers and an excavator. They also set fire to the vehicles carrying our men, he said.        
	We have no idea where our employees are. We have informed our headquarters in Mumbai and are waiting for instructions.        
	This isnt the first time Hindalco Industries, the flagship company of the Aditya Birla Group, has faced Maoist terror in Gumla and adjoining Lohardaga district.        
	In May this year, demand for levy had shut down mining operations for more than 20 days. In the last financial year, the company remained open for 200 days following CPI (Maoist)-sponsored violence.

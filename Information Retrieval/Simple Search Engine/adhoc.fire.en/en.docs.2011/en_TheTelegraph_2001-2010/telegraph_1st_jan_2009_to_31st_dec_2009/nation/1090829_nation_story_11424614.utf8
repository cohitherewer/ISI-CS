          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 28: A 15-year-old boy was today detained for allegedly raping a five-year-old girl in a Delhi orphanage where her mother had apparently left her hoping she would be safe.        
	On August 18, mother Rekha was informed by officials that her daughter had to be hospitalised. When she reached the hospital, she was told Suman (name changed) had been raped 15 days ago.         
	The mother went to police on August 20. Rekha said Suman told her that an inmate of the home took her to a room and assaulted her.         
	A medical examination has confirmed rape.        
	The boy is believed to be a Class IV student. He came to the orphanage three months ago, a month after Suman. She is in Class I.         
	It was very difficult to find out who among the many in the orphanage had raped her. Since the girl wasnt in a position to identify anyone, we had to talk to each child systematically, said an officer on the case.        
	The children were split into age groups and also according to the time of their arrival at the home.         
	We then zeroed in on one boy who by his conduct aroused suspicion and whose responses were not proper. Consequently, the boy admitted to his guilt, said the officer.         
	The boy has been produced before the juvenile justice board.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Advani (b)logs out
                                                                                                               Advani (b)logs out
  - BJP veteran missing from action but his portal is abuzz with political debate        SANJAY K. JHA                                      
	New Delhi, Aug. 26: L.K. Advani seems to have (b)logged out.        
	The embattled leader of Opposition is not only absent from the scene while his party roils, he is also missing from his portal, which too is witnessing turbulence.        
	Advani has not posted any blog on his much-publicised portal  touted as the most interactive by an Indian politician  since April 22. The last statement he issued was on June 1, expressing concern at the attacks on Indian students in Australia.        
	But his portal has provided the best platform to BJP workers and sympathisers to debate the ills afflicting the party  from the election debacle to the leadership crisis, from the now-expelled Jaswant Singh to Sudheendra Kulkarni, who snapped his active association with the party earlier this week.        
	The interactive forum is alive and buzzing with politics, but minus Advani.        
	The participants, mostly regular visitors to the portal, seem more concerned about the road for the future than the squabbling within the party.        
	The dominant view is that the time for introspection has been turned into an occasion for ungracious rebellion.        
	Although some of the participants have commented on individual leaders  like party chief Rajnath Singhs inability to control things, Advanis inaction and the inexplicable fetish of BJP leaders for the creator of Pakistan  the overriding theme is the need to find ways to come out of the abyss.        
	Lets use the collective political knowledge and experience of all the leaders to create a road for the future, wrote one party worker.        
	The most interesting debate, however, is on Kulkarni, who used to be the master of this portal till sometime back. Some volunteers who had worked with him in the Advani for PM campaign feel that Kulkarni, who parted ways because of ideological differences, had caused the maximum damage to the BJP.        
	They asked what had changed in the BJP ideology in the past few months  that is, after the election defeat  that made him formally snap ties with the party.        
	Some of us left our cushy MNC jobs to work with you, one volunteer wrote. How come you develop differences only when the party lost and became part of the media orgy that is shredding the BJP to parts?        
	Kulkarnijee, another volunteer wrote, we thought you are a leader who will teach us how to face adverse circumstances all those who truly belong to the BJP and its ideology will remain; those who were here for power and for enjoying good times will slowly go away.        
	Many party workers suggested promoting only those committed to the party ideology. One proposed selecting 30-40 young leaders from across the country, locking them up for debate and training for a few months, and then giving them the task of running the party.        
	Another said new leaders were needed as the old the existing set-up as well as the GeNext  had been found incapable.

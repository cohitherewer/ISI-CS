The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Passage delays Kasab case
                                                                                                               Passage delays Kasab case
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, April 5: A grenade-proof passage being constructed for Ajmal Kasabs security in Arthur Road jail has pushed back the 26/11 trial by at least a week.        
	The trial was to begin at the high-security central Mumbai prison tomorrow, but the public works department (PWD), which is constructing the passage and also erecting a wall, told the special court trying the case that it would need a week more.        
	The special anti-terror court is situated on the jail premises.        
	The construction inside the jail is still on. The work is expected to be completed in six to seven days, special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam said.        
	Kasab, the lone gunman captured alive during the November 26 attacks, has been produced in the special court only once since his arrest because of the high level of threat to his life.         
	The Maharashtra government has decided to fortify Arthur Road jail in such a way that Kasab can be produced in the special court with minimum risk.        
	Since the past month, PWD employees have been working to construct the passage. Security sources have declined to speak on the specifics of the construction.        
	Kasab, in his egg-shaped cell, is guarded by the Indo-Tibetan Border Force. The special anti-terror court he will appear before is the one where those accused in the 1993 serial blasts were tried.         
	The one-storeyed courtroom was constructed from jail barracks in 1994 to conduct the trial in the blasts case.         
	Bollywood actor Sanjay Dutt and 122 other accused were heard in this courtroom over 14 years by special judge Pramod Kode.        
	Tomorrow, 21-year-old Kasab would appear before special court judge M.L. Tahilyani through video-conferencing.         
	Anjali Waghmare and K.P. Pawar are likely to represent him at the hearing.        
	Both the lawyers, appointed by judge Tahilyani, have been provided Z-category cover after Shiv Sena activists attacked Waghmares house last week.        
	Questions have been raised about Waghmares appointment after a man, who claims to be a 26/11 victim and has demanded a compensation of Rs 50,000, said she had agreed to fight his case.        
	Yesterday, advocate K.B.N. Lam, one of the three lawyers who had volunteered to defend Kasab and faced the Senas wrath, moved an application before the special court demanding that Waghmare file an affidavit saying she was not representing any 26/11 victims claim for compensation.         
	Judge Tahilyani will hear the application tomorrow.        
	Waghmare has denied the alleged victims claim. It is a rumour. I have not accepted any such vakalatnama, she said after agreeing to represent Kasab.

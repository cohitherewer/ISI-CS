The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Resilient city rages
                                                                                                               Resilient city rages
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Guwahati, April 6: Hands trading wares and hailing autos till moments before the blast picked up bottles and stones and hurled them at policemen and firemen  telling the government that resilient Guwahatis patience had finally run out.        
	After an initial phase of shock and a few quick calls to ensure their near and dear ones were safe, the common man on the street began waging a war against those responsible for their security but had let them down too often.        
	As chants of government murdabad rose, the police resorted to mild caning to disperse the Maligaon blast protesters. A few photographers, police and fire brigade personnel were injured.        
	Why are we targeted again and again? What did we do to deserve this? Why is the government unable to do anything to prevent the carnage? asked trader Ratul Chakroborty.        
	Strewn at the site were mangled frames of bikes, wounded people wailing and gasping for breath, maimed bodies and pools of blood.        
	Guwahati has become like Pakistani towns and cities where blasts have become commonplace, said Anup Saha, a resident.         
	How long can we remain quiet with people getting killed and maimed on a regular basis? Look at our vulnerability. The bomb was planted near Jalukbari police station, cried Sanjib Das, another resident. Enough is enough. We want the government to firmly deal with these demons.         
	Todays was the second blast in the city in a week. On March 31, militants had triggered a blast at Jyotikuchi.

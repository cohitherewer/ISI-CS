The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | US terror alert bites
                                                                                                               US terror alert bites
          OUR BUREAU AND PTI                              
	New Delhi, June 4: The US has claimed India faces a serious and growing threat from terrorism and asked its citizens to be vigilant in this country, prompting Delhi to assert India is completely safe and the advisory unjustified.        
	Home minister P. Chidambaram said India was safer than many other countries in the world and the government would try to persuade Washington to withdraw the advisory.        
	Hours after his remarks, the advisory, posted on the American embassy website since June 2, was removed this evening but the websites of the US consulates-general in Calcutta and Mumbai continued to carry it.        
	The government seemed unaware of the advisory for two full days before TV channels played it up this morning.        
	But on a day the government dismissed the terror advisory, Delhi police claimed to have arrested a key operative of the Lashkar-e-Toiba near Qutab Minar.         
	Mohammad Umer Madni, 50, was not carrying weapons or ammunition, the police said. He operated from Nepal, they added. The Pakistan-based Lashkar is blamed for the November 26-29 Mumbai attacks.        
	The US advisory coincides with Washingtons deafening silence on the release of Hafiz Saeed, chief of Lashkar and its front Jamaat-ud-Dawa, by a Pakistani court on June 2.         
	Islamabad had put Saeed, prime accused in the Mumbai attacks, under house arrest days after the carnage following global pressure.        
	The Urgent Warden Message posted on the embassy website said: The United States Mission in India wishes to urgently remind all US citizens resident in or travelling to India that there is a high threat from terrorism throughout India.        
	It urged US citizens to maintain a low profile in India and added: Americans in India should be vigilant at all times and monitor local news reports and vary their routes and times in carrying out daily activities.        
	The advisory asked Americans to consider the level of security while visiting public places, including religious sites, and while choosing hotels, restaurants and entertainment and recreation venues.        
	I dont think there is any justification for the advisory, Chidambaram told reporters. India is a completely safe country. Thousands of tourists come to India and we look forward to welcoming them.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Different Somen sweats in battle for relevance
                                                                                                               Different Somen sweats in battle for relevance
          SUJAN DUTTA IN DIAMOND HARBOUR                        A poster of Samik Lahiri; (below) Somen Mitra in Diamond Harbour. Pictures by Sanjay Chattopadhyaya				                                       
	Somen Mitra is sweaty and a little breathless after a mornings round of speeches and processions through the workers colonies along the Ganga in Maheshtala and Metiabruz in his Diamond Harbour constituency.        
	I am a different kind of politician, he says.        
	Mitra has just sat down in the house of a party colleague with a glass of sharbat and flatly refuses to pose for a photograph. I do not go after the press; the press comes after me, he says.        
	His party is the Pragatisheel Indira Congress; he is contesting from Diamond Harbour for the first time; and he is contesting on the Trinamul Congress symbol with, it must be rubbed in, the blessings of Mamata Banerjee.        
	Twelve years ago, Mitra had drubbed her in the organisational elections in the state Congress and was chiefly responsible for her expulsion from the party and the emergence of Trinamul. He is out of the Congress himself now. A different kind of politician, indeed.        
	It doesnt matter and do you know why? He explains why his political persona does not evoke questions from the public. Because two years ago at a rally in the Shahid Minar grounds I proclaimed that Bengal needed a secular democratic movement against the Left Front and readily acknowledged Mamata Banerjee as its leader.        
	With that, Mitra focuses on the campaign in Diamond Harbour; the fact that Samik Lahiri, the CPM candidate and sitting MP, spent crores from the state exchequer to get Diego Maradona to Maheshtala.        
	It was a gimmick, he says. People are not taken in by such tricks any more.        
	Mitra lives in Sealdah, Calcutta, from where he has successfully contested Assembly elections. His contest from Diamond Harbour is also his struggle for political relevance.        
	He is not with any of the major political outfits. He has never really been a popular leader and even in the Congress had risen up the ranks of the state organisation largely by manipulating it.        
	Mamata had once heaped scorn on the likes of him by calling them political watermelons  red (the colour of the CPM) inside and green outside.        
	But since the 2004 Lok Sabha elections  which Lahiri won handsomely  Nandigram and Singur, the 2006 Assembly elections, the 2008 panchayat elections and Februarys Bishnupur by-poll have combined to propel Mitra to make the gallant effort.        
	So, early every morning, he drives from his house in Sealdah to a locality in the constituency to take up campaigning for the day. Over the last few days he has been criss-crossing Maheshtala, Metiabruz and Budge Budge.        
	Tracking down a candidate in the heat of the day and in the middle of a campaign is a tough job. By the time you reach the level-crossing where he is to address the meeting, he has moved on to the next shanty.        
	Diamond Harbour constituency is neither completely rural nor completely urban. It is largely both. Factories, jute mills and brick kilns, workers colonies, markets and farmers settlements are scattered around farmland.        
	In its geographical spread it is one of the largest in south Bengal. Its electorate of about 13.7 lakh will vote in more than 1,610 booths. Only the CPM has the organisation to cover this ground.        
	Lahiris larger-than-lifesize portraits, showing him resplendent in a red kurta, adorn trees, lampposts, houses. We brought Maradona to Maheshtala because we are building a football academy there, says Aveek Lahiri, Samiks brother and CPM activist, at the partys campaign committee office in Amtala.        
	The stadium will be named after Maradona. If Im not wrong, even Trinamul leaders were spotted trying to catch a glimpse of Maradona.        
	Trinamul workers allege that part of an amount of Rs 16 crore spent by the state government was used to take Maradona to Maheshtala.        
	Trinamul, campaigning actively for Mitra, has made an issue of land acquired for projects in Maheshtala and its environs. That is a catchy issue. As the crow flies, the constituency is closest to Nandigram.        
	Dulal Das, Mitras councillor from a Maheshtala ward, alleges that the CPM has helped promoters acquire 262 acres for a riverside housing project and has changed land use in defiance of rules.        
	Ratan Bagchi, the CPM convener for the constituency, hits back saying Mitra has declared that his wife bought a plot opposite the Tata factory site in Singur and has disclosed this to the Election Commission.        
	So land in Singur is suitable for Somen Mitra to build a bungalow on, but not for the Nano plant, he says.        
	Bagchi and his party have taken the Singur campaign, and their charge that Mamata and her colleagues are anti-development, in a big way to Diamond Harbour because they are convinced this has a ready audience.        
	This despite the drubbing the CPM got in the panchayat elections in South 24-Parganas. Bagchi claims that two months ago, the party had convened a meeting of about 400 landholders who may have to give up their plots if the proposed Barasat-Raichak expressway project is taken up. All of them agreed to give up their land, he claims.        
	The minute calculations that the partys activists are doing in its little offices, however, betray a nervousness. They worry most that Bengali Muslims, who are believed to have voted for Trinamul  or against the CPM  in the panchayat polls, may still not vote for the front.        
	We have recovered ground, insists Bagchi. We are certain of this from the turnouts at our public meetings.        
	The majority of the 40 per cent Muslim population in the constituency is Bengali-speaking.        
	In the state polls of 2006, the opposition to the Left totalled 53.54 per cent of the vote across the newly demarcated Assembly segments (Falta, Satgachia, Bishnupur, Maheshtala, Budge Budge, Metiabruz) of Diamond Harbour Lok Sabha constituency. The Opposition vote rose to 55.78 per cent in the panchayat polls of 2008 and the Left vote dropped to 44.22 per cent in the delimited constituency.        
	If he can sustain the trend in the Lok Sabha election on May 13, Somen Mitra will remain politically relevant.

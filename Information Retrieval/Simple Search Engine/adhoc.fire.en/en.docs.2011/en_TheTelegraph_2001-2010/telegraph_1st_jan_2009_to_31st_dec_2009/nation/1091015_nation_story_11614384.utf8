          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 14: Normal life was paralysed in most parts of Mayurbhanj due to the JMM-sponsored daylong bandh in protest against the attack on their leader Sudam Marandi.         
	Three security men, including an assistant sub-inspector, were killed in the attack, while Marandi and former zila parishad chairman Bhadav Hansda escaped unhurt.         
	The deceased were identified as assistant sub-inspector of Chandua police station Narayan Pradhan and Marandis personal security officers Gama Hembram and Rajendra Hembram. JMM activists are peeved over the intelligence failure and inadequate security, though the chief minister Naveen Patnaik ordered a probe into the incident.        
	Protesters blocked railway tracks at Bhubaneswar railway station leading to the termination of Baripada-Bhubaneswar Superfast Express. The blockades led to the cancellation of Rupsa- Baripada DMU train.         
	The bandh began at 6am with JMM activists burning tyres and shouting slogans at important locations including district headquarters town of Baripada. Activists marched on the streets and blocked roads at several places. Few of them also tried to block NH-5 that witnessed a thin run of vehicles.        
	Schools, institutions and shops remained closed and vehicles kept off the roads for the better part of the day, while markets wore a deserted look.         
	Mayurbhanj SP Dayal Gangwar said the bandh passed off peacefully without any major untoward incidents. We had arranged for tight security and kept a strict vigil, he said.         
	Unidentified armed men yesterday gunned down three police persons during a football tournament at Bandap village under Chandua police station on Orissa-Bengal border where Marandi was the chief guest.         
	Describing the incident as unfortunate, a visibly upset Marandi said a few armed men hiding themselves behind the bush had shot at his bodyguards, when he was getting in his vehicle after prize distribution. Hearing the shots, he ran for cover and managed to reach the district headquarters late night after walking down kilometres and then hitchhiking.         
	Chief minister Naveen Patnaik today condemned the attack and said combing operation was on. He assured that security around Marandi would be strengthened and police protection would be provided to any politician, whose life is under threat.         
	Police remained tight-lipped as to whether yesterdays attack was a handiwork of Maoists. Investigations are on and we are looking into all angles, said Gangwar SP, who had rushed to the spot last night.

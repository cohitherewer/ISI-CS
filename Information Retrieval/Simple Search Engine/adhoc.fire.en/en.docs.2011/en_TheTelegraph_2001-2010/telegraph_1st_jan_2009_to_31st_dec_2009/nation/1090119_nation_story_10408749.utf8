                                                                                                               Paswan spanner in poll alliance
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Jan. 18: The UPA and the NDA gearing up for a keen tussle in the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls in Bihar have one thing in common. Both are plagued with vicious infighting over sharing of seats ahead of the elections.        
	While Ram Vilas Paswan has increased Lalu Prasad and Congresss worries by stating recently that his LJP would contest all the 40 seats, the BJPs two high-profile men  party spokesman Ravishankar Prasad and actor Shatrughan Sinha  have been fighting for the same Patna Saheb seat, adding to the worries of its prime ministerial nominee L.K. Advani.        
	Moreover, the BJP is believed to have been claiming the prestigious north Bihar Muzaffarpur seat, which JD-U stalwart George Fernandes represents in the lower house of Parliament.         
	We had left our claim on Muzaffarpur seat in Fernandess honour. With the possibility of ageing and ailing Fernandes staying away from the fray, we will like to get the seat back, which earlier was our share, said a senior BJP leader, adding: Muzaffarpur seat will be an important issue in course of formal seat-sharing meeting between the BJP and JD-U.        
	Paswans LJP, Congress and RJD had contested the 2004 Lok Sabha polls in alliance winning over 30 out of the states 40 seats and in the process causing severe damage to the NDA.         
	Paswans stay in UPA and contest the polls in alliance with the RJD and Congress is very crucial, particularly after the state is slipped in Nitish Kumar-led NDA rule and has attained the image of a better-ruled state, said a UPA leader.        
	A section of the UPA leaders still believe Paswans threat to go it alone in the polls more as a pressure on the RJD and Congress to extract more seats in its share than actual intent to field his candidates on all the 40 seats.

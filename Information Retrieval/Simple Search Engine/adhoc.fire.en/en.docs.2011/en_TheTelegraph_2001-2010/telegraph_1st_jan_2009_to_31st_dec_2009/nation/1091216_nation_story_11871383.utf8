The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Job jitters claim young life

          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                          Students and police locked in a tussle at Sri Krishna Devaraya University in Andhra Pradesh. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Hyderabad, Dec. 15: Mahadasha Madhav Satya Venkata Narayana had dreamed of joining a software company after his MBA course at Andhra University in Visakhapatnam.        
	But the 23-year-old student felt betrayed last Wednesday when the Centre announced it would initiate the process for a separate state of Telangana, which Narayana and many of his peers believed would ultimately alienate Hyderabad, the nerve-centre of IT, from Andhra Pradesh.         
	Narayana died yesterday after suffering a stroke while on a hunger strike on the university campus along with fellow protesters campaigning for a samaikya (integrated) Andhra.        
	As vice-president of the Andhra University Students Union, Narayana took the lead and participated in the first phase of the indefinite hunger strike that began on Thursday.         
	He was shifted to King Georges Hospital on Sunday night as his condition worsened. The budding management graduate died yesterday morning, the first student casualty in the second bout of the campaign for a united Andhra.         
	Narayana, the son of M. Sriramamurthy Mummadivaram of East Godavari district in coastal Andhra, had planned to settle down in Hyderabad after his MBA.         
	He had already received several call letters and attended some interviews also, said mother Nirmala, speaking to this correspondent from Mummadivaram.         
	His sister, Damayanti, has an MCA degree and is working in a software company in Visakhapatnam.        
	Friends of Narayana contend that a separate state would disturb several thousands of IT jobs in towns such as Visakhapatnam, Tirupati, Nellore, Vijayawada and Anantpur.         
	Most of the IT companies have their base in Hyderabad and may not prefer to give projects to other cities if the state is divided, said Shiva Prasad, a classmate of Narayana at the universitys MBA school, voicing the fears of his fellow students.        
	Though the student leaders wanted to take out a procession, the family refused their request. I do not wish to turn my sons last rites into a political gimmick, said Narayanas father Sriramamurthy, a state government employee.        
	The current bout of student protest is a throwback to the seventies when the movement for a separate Telangana and an integrated Andhra had disrupted an entire academic year at Osmania and Andhra universities. As many as 375 students died in the movement for Telangana, while 52 perished in the struggle for Andhra.        
	Since then, students of Osmania University in Hyderabad have been identified as potential troublemakers with a radical bent of mind. Through the seventies, several public sector undertakings included a rider in their advertisements looking for jobs: Osmania students need not apply.        
	Education authorities are upset over the protests as they could affect prospects of filling up the large number of seats in the engineering colleges of the state. Andhra has nearly 275 engineering colleges with over 2 lakh seats, over 30 per cent of which have been lying idle over the last two years. The new colleges emerging in the east  in Calcutta, Bhubaneswar and Raipur  have already hit us. Now the agitation will further reduce admissions in engineering in and around Hyderabad, said Chukka Ramaiah, an educationist who runs special tutorials for entrance exams.        
	If the agitation escalates further, parents fear it would impact the future of their children set to appear for the various entrance tests: those conducted by the state and the Centre and even those for admission to foreign universities.         
	The government appeared to talk tough. Inspector-general of police A.R. Anuradha said the students participating in the movement are doing so at the risk of their own future. If their participation in protests is established with video footages and cases are registered against them, they will not get visas or passports in time, she said.

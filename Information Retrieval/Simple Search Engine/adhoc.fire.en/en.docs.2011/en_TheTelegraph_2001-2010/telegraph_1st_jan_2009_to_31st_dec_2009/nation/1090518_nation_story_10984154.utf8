	Lost to: Siddhant Mohapatra (BJD)        
	Margin: 66,566

	Constituency: Hajipur (Bihar)        
	Lost to: Ram Sunder Dass (JD(U))        
	Margin: 37,954

	Lost to: Mahabali Singh (JD(U))

	Portfolio: Minister of state for rural development and parliamentary affairs        
	Constituency: Hingoli (Maharashtra)

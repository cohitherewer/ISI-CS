	Bhay ho for Jai ho    
	New Delhi: The BJP has a parody ready for the Congresss chosen poll jingle  Jai ho.    
	The Opposition party will sing Bhay ho.    
	The BJP on Saturday presented the one-minute parody to be used as a TV commercial to counter the Congress theme song based on A.R. Rahmans Oscar-winning number from Slumdog Millionaire.    
	The BJP claimed the parody was penned by a sympathiser. The video of Bhay Ho starts with a man putting a bag on the upper berth of a train which provokes poor children sitting on the opposite berth to shout: Bhay ho.     
	The song runs as follows:     
	Bhay ho, bhay ho, bhay ho. Phir bhi Jai ho! Aaja aaja voter is jhanse ke taley Aaja aaja jhuthe muthe vade ke taley Bhay ho, bhukh ho Ratti ratti sachchi hamne jaan gavai hai Bhukhe pet jaag jaag raat bitayi hai Mandi ki mar me naukri gavan di Gin gin vaade hamne zindagi bitadi Mandi ho. Atank ho. Mahengai ho Bhay ho. Phir bhi Jai ho.    
	Tharoor relief    
	Thiruvananthapuram: The Congress was spared a small embarrassment in Kerala with Vijayan Thomas, the chairman of its TV channel Jaihind, giving up his plan to contest from Thiruvananthapuram and support party candidate Shashi Tharoor.     
	Thomas said on Friday that he was not going to enter the fray. He would work for Tharoor. Thomas, an NRI businessman, said Congress chief Sonia Gandhi had requested him not to contest. Thomas, it was said, had been cut up with the state party leaders who did not help him get the ticket.    
	Jolt to JB    
	Kolhapur: The Congress has denied veteran Orissa leader J.B. Patnaik an Assembly ticket, choosing a fresh face  debutant Pradeep Sahu  to replace him.     
	The three-time chief minister and sitting MLA from Begunia was removed from the post of leader of Opposition in the Assembly recently.    
	Eighty-two-year-old Patnaik, JB to colleagues, was keen to contest but the Congress high command had sent early signals that he may be sidelined. A few days ago, Ghulam Nabi Azad, the general secretary in charge of Orissa, hinted that the party would opt for a new face for the chief ministers chair.     
	After being removed as leader of Opposition, Patnaik was made a special invitee to the CWC  the partys highest decision-making body. He was also made a member of the manifesto committee but kept out of the state poll committee.

	Rae Bareli, Jan. 27: If Sonia Gandhis dream railway coach factory in her constituency took shape today, she has much to thank the hundreds of farmers who sacrificed their land to make way for the project.         
	Flanked by railway minister Lalu Prasad and her son Rahul Gandhi, Sonia flagged off the construction of the countrys third such facility at Lalganj, 30km from here.         
	On October 14, the previous date for the inauguration, the Congress president had to return after Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati cancelled the allotment of the land to the railways.         
	Mayavatis argument was that a large number of Dalit farmers would lose their land if the project came through.         
	But for the 300 and odd farmers who would have indeed lost their land, the decision came as a shocker as agriculture was no longer rewarding.         
	We went to the farmers and asked if they were willing to sacrifice. It was a difficult situation. There were farmers who sacrificed all they had. There are farmers who turned landless, said Kausalendra Singh, a farmer in Lalganj.         
	We decided to root for industry to stop migration and low turnout from agriculture and save our future generations, said Bharat Verma, a Loadh caste farmer at Sekhowapur village adjacent to the railway coach factory and a supporter of Mayavati.         
	Bharat, a father of four sons, lost his entire 1.5 bighas of land to the factory. I have been promised that one of my sons will get a job as I have become landless now. Like me, others who have also lost their land would get jobs, he said.         
	Many like Bharat formed a group and decided to be a party in the court case at Allahabad High Court challenging the cancellation of land allotment. They wanted to convince the court that they were in favour of the factory.         
	Among others, Ram Gopal Gupta, a member of the gram sabha, and Abhindra Pandey, a Mayavati supporter, went to court against the government move and deposed that they were willing to hand over the land to the railways.         
	We dont have false sentiments over the land. It was lying useless for years as it was unproductive and there was no irrigation facility. Whatever little we grow is destroyed by the invasion of nilgais, which are a menace in the area, said Pandey.         
	On October 16, the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court lifted the status quo orders on the land.         
	Two days later, Mayavati, who studied the report on the mood of the farmers in despatches from the district magistrate, relented and returned 189.25 hectares of land to the railways, paving the way for the project.

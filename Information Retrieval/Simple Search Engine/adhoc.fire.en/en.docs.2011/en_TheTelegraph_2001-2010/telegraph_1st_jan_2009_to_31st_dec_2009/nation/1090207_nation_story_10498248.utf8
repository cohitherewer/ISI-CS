The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Knights toast solid squad
                                                                                                               Knights toast solid squad
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Sinquerim (Goa), Feb. 6: The Kolkata Knight Riders decision to spend only half their kitty of $1.21 million and sign up a Bangladeshi pacer without much of a CV may smell of poor strategy to some. Satisfied team officials, however, say everything has gone to plan.        
	Our presence at the auction was more a matter of propriety; our team has already been built, said team director Joy Bhattacharjya.        
	We had a smaller purse compared with the others. But we are quite satisfied that things have gone according to plan and we have achieved a solid team.        
	The franchise, which held trials last month to select Indian youngsters, had just one vacant slot for a foreign player at the auction. It bought Mashrafe Mortaza, presumably as replacement for Shoaib Akhtar, forced out by the India-Pakistan tension.        
	Umar Guls replacement will be signed up after the auction, from the Indian Premier Leagues larger list of unauctioned players.        
	The Knights had picked up four foreign players before the auction, more than fulfilling their requirements, team strategists say.        
	We have already re-signed two temporary players from last season  (Australian batsman) Brad Hodge and Ajantha Mendis. We have also signed Australian Moises Henriques for this season, and may need one more foreign player, Bhattacharjya said.        
	In addition to these three, the Kolkata franchise has just picked up Angelo Mathews, a Lankan all-rounder yet to become a familiar face in international cricket.        
	The Knight Riders are confident that the new bowling line-up would deliver the goods following the exit of Shoaib and Gul.        
	Mendis and (Ajit) Agarkar are expected to play a pivotal role with others like Mortaza, or even Angelo, to support them, Bhattacharjya said.        
	Sources said Mortaza was strongly recommended by Bangladesh coach Jamie Siddons. In our mind our team is complete. As far as picking Mortaza is concerned, we think he will bring value to the team. He is a talented bowler and our coach John Buchanan too was keen on him, Bhattacharjya said.        
	IPL sources said the Knights decision to buy Mortaza would help them expand the teams fan base in Bangladesh and widen its catchment area.        
	The IPL governing council has said it is open to the idea of teams extending their fan base to other countries and playing there if these countries cricket boards allow that.        
	Bhattacharjya said that while the Knights were allowed another foreign player, the last of their 10, the team was pinning its hopes on young domestic players too.

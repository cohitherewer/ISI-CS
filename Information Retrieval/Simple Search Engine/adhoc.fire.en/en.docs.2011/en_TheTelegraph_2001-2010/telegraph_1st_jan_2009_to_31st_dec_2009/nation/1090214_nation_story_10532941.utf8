The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Went by proof, says CBI
                                                                                                               Went by proof, says CBI
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 13: The CBI today said its stand on Moninder Singh Pandher, who was sentenced to death despite the investigative agency giving him a clean chit, was based exclusively on evidence.        
	Reacting to the court verdict which had not taken into account the CBIs contention that Pandher was away in Australia when Rimpa was raped and murdered in February 2005, the agency said its opinion in all the 16 cases in Nithari was based on legally admissible evidence.        
	The chargesheets were finalised after a thorough probe from all angles, including scientific tests like DNA fingerprinting, skull superimposition and other legally admissible evidence the CBI said.

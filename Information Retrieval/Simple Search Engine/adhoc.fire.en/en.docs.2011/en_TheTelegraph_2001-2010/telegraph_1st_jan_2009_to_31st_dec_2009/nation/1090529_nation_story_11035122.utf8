The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Apex court raps emperor judges 
                                                                                                               Apex court raps emperor judges 
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, May 28: The Supreme Court today criticised some judges tendency to act as emperors and pass orders beyond their jurisdiction.        
	The vacation bench of Justices Markandey Katju and Deepak Verma made the observation while staying an Orissa High Court order that had increased the marks of six candidates in the postgraduate medical entrance examination by 30 to 60.        
	How can the high court increase marks? The judge is an emperor? He can increase marks? Justice Katju, an open votary of judicial restraint in executive and legislative matters, said.        
	He blamed lawyers too. You lawyers think you can make the judiciary do anything. Judges should also know their limits, he said.        
	The court then issued notices to the state government on appeals filed by some students against the high court order. These students had been displaced from their positions on the merit list by the award of higher marks to the six candidates.        
	The high court had accepted the six candidates plea that their answers were the correct ones, and not those that figured as correct on the model answer papers on the basis of which the answer sheets had been evaluated. The high court went by medical literature adduced by these students. This upset the entire merit list, said Shibashish Mishra, the lawyer for the students who had appealed.        
	He added that the high court had also passed a blanket order restraining any other candidate from seeking similar relief. But if the model answers were wrong, they were wrong for everybody, Mishra said. All should then have got extra marks.

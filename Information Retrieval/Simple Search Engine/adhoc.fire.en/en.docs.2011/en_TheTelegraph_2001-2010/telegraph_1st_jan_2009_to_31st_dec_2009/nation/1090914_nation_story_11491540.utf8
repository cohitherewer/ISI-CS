The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Found: UGC ruse on deemed varsity
                                                                                                               Found: UGC ruse on deemed varsity
  - Report to be silent on names        CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                           Kapil Sibal                                        
	New Delhi, Sept. 13: The UGC misinterpreted the law and the rationale behind sanctioning deemed university status allowing undeserving institutions to flourish, a human resource development ministry review is learnt to have found.         
	The report by Kapil Sibals ministry is also likely to question the grant of deemed university status to relatively new institutions yet to establish academic credentials, top government sources have told The Telegraph.         
	The review has thrown up several cases where new institutions were granted the status because of a flawed understanding of the vision behind allowing deemed universities, the sources said.         
	It has also revealed cases where the same teachers have been listed on the rolls of multiple institutions run under a private deemed university  effectively misleading students about an institutions faculty strength.         
	These findings indict the UGC  which sends expert teams to scrutinise demands for deemed university status before recommending it  for the unprecedented growth of often substandard private higher education institutions.         
	But the report is unlikely to directly assign responsibility, as these findings can also embarrass the ministry  which finally sanctions the deemed university status on the basis of recommendations of the UGC.         
	The review panel has completed reviewing 81 of 92 private deemed universities and is scheduled to complete examining the rest, and 38 public funded institutions by September 24.         
	The review was ordered by Sibal on June 4. His ministry also ordered the UGC to withdraw a controversial order that allowed the deemed universities to confuse students by calling themselves full-fledged universities.        
	The report is expected to frame the governments future policy on deemed universities  once encouraged to assist top institutions offer degrees, but now tarnished with allegations of subverting standards through corruption.         
	Once an institution is granted deemed university status, any constituent colleges offering professional courses do not need separate recognition to award degrees, a Supreme Court judgment has held.         
	This judgment  in a case filed by a deemed university named after Tamil poet Bharatidasam  has, however, been misinterpreted by the All India Council for Technical Education and the UGC, the review may argue.         
	The judgment has been cited by the AICTE and the UGC to allow deemed universities to set up new campuses  both within the country and abroad  without government sanction.         
	There is a view that this is an incorrect reading of the judgment. Rules applicable to constituent colleges which exist at the time that deemed university status is granted, cannot exempt all new campuses or colleges from scrutiny, a member on the HRD ministrys review panel argued.         
	The member  speaking on condition of anonymity  said the review team also disagreed with the UGCs rationale in granting deemed university status to young institutions before they had established their credentials.         
	Only institutions created under an act of Parliament  such as central universities or IITs  state legislatures or deemed-to-be-universities recognised by the UGC can award degrees in India.         
	The concept of deemed universities was envisioned first by Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan to aid established centres of excellence  like the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research  in offering degrees without losing their autonomy.

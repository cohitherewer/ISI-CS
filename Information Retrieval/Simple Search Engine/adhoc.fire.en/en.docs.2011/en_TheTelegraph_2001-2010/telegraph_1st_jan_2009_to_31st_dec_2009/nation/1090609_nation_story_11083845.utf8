The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | SC glare on Maya transfers
                                                                                                               SC glare on Maya transfers
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 8: The Mayavati government will have to explain to the Supreme Court why it had transferred dozens of senior police officers and bureaucrats after the Lok Sabha elections.        
	The apex court today issued notices to the Uttar Pradesh government on a petition challenging the post-poll transfers of 34 IPS officers, including 17 district police chiefs, and 13 IAS officers.        
	This is an issue that requires serious consideration, the vacation bench said.        
	Mayavati had allegedly asked state administration officials to ensure her Bahujan Samaj Party won at least 50 of the states 80 seats. Sources say she ordered the transfers as punishment after her party secured just 21 seats.        
	The court, though, wondered if it could stay the transfers, one of the demands by the petitioners, former IPS officer Prakash Singh and former IAS officer Satya Narain Shukla.        
	It, however, asked the petitioners to draw its attention if similar action took place in the future, which should make it difficult for Mayavati to continue with the transfer spree.        
	The petition urged the court to ensure that no all-India service official was transferred, suspended or demoted in violation of the law. It said these officials could be punished only in consultation with the Centre.        
	How can the executive powers of the state be exercised in derogation of the powers of the Centre? Shukla argued.        
	The petition also referred to the demotion of senior IAS officer Dinesh Singh from the post of principal secretary to secretary, and the suspension of IPS officer Ajay Kumar Mishra as police chief of Mainpuri district.        
	Mishra had allegedly defied instructions to act against Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav.

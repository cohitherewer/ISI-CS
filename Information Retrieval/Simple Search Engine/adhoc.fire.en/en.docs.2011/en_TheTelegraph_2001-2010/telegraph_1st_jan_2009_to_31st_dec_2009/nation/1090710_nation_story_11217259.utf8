The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sultanganj fears pilgrim clashes
                                                                                                               Sultanganj fears pilgrim clashes
          GAUTAM SARKAR                                        
	Sultanganj (Bhagalpur), July 9: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumars promise to request Jharkhand Governor Syed Sibtey Razi and the latters offer to withdraw a ban on direct entry on dak kanwarias has failed to defuse tension among the devotees.        
	Dak kanwarias are pilgrims who run a distance of 110km from Sultanganj to Deoghar in less than 24 hours after they fetch the holy water of the Ganga in Sultanganj. Unlike ordinary pilgrims, who sometimes stand in a queue for hours, dak kanwarias have direct straight access to the temple after they reach.        
	Heeding Nitishs demand, Razi had earlier instructed Deoghar officials to reintroduce dak kanwarias direct entry into the sanctum sanctorum of the Baidhyanath temple (in picture). But, administration has decided to continue with the ban on Sundays, Mondays and Wednesdays.        
	Worshipping Lord Shiva on Mondays of Shravan (the holy month which began from yesterday) carries a special significance. So, dak kanwarias try to reach Deoghar on Monday. Barring our entry to the temple on that day is a sacrilege, said Bishambhar, a devotee from Dehradum, who sustained injuries in a lathicharge on Tuesday.         
	On Tuesday, a clash erupted on the banks of the Ganga in Sultanganj when pilgrims went on a rampage protesting against the governors ban. Police had to resort to lathicharge to control the mob that comprised pilgrims from across the country. Dharmendra, a devotee from Samastipur, and Chano Roy, from Nawada, sustained serious injuries in the incident.        
	PHED minister Aswani Choubey who rushed to Sultanganj from Deoghar last night, also lambasted the high-handedness of the Jharkhand government. It was only yesterday morning that the Deoghar deputy commissioner informed me of the decision. He said the decision was taken to curb the rising number of fake certificates and for security reasons. Choubey said.        
	The decision has been disapproved by the priests of Baidhyanath temple to people of Bihar (the originating point of the mela).         
	Jail Shanker Das, the Sultanganj sub-divisional officer, predicted that more such altercations could not be ruled out.

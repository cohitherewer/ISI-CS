          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, April 12: A case between parents and Orissa government regarding the proposed fee hike in private English-medium schools, pending before the high court, seems far from settled.         
	The hike has been a contentious issue in Orissa ever since management of several private schools decided to hike admission and tuition fees from the 2009-10 session after the Sixth Pay Commission recommended a pay hike for both teaching and non-teaching staff. The move triggered fury from parents, especially in Cuttack and Bhubaneswar, where some schools hiked fees 50-100 per cent of the previous rate, forcing the government to intervene.         
	Only 25 of the 211 schools responded after the state issued a notification seeking details of funds required to pay a salary as recommended by the commission.         
	On March 27 the government, however, issued an order allowing 25 per cent hike in tuition fees and 15 per cent hike in development fees by managing boards of those private schools that intend to implement Sixth Pay Commission recommendations.         
	The issue reached the high court after an association comprising parents of DAV Cuttack School students challenged the validity of the government order calling it arbitrary.         
	The petition came up before a single judge bench of Justice M.M. Das on April 9, but was posted for hearing on May 4. Till that time the government notification on the hike shall remain inoperative, the court has said in an interim order.         
	The court has also asked the secretary of the department of school and mass education and the director primary education to clarify their respective stands through affidavits to be filed by them to the court by April 9.

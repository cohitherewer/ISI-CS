The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Delhi seeks terror rider for Pak aid
                                                                                                               Delhi seeks terror rider for Pak aid
          JAYANTH JACOB AND NASIR JAFFRY                              
	New Delhi/Islamabad, Jan. 30: India will lobby with the US and other countries to link military aid to Islamabad with its action against terrorism amid signs that the Pakistani probe into the Mumbai attacks will yield little.        
	Delhi will also move the United Nations Al Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee to ban more Pakistani entities and individuals for aiding and abetting terrorism.        
	The committee had in December banned the Jamaat-ud-Dawa, a front of the terrorist group Lashkar-e-Toiba that India, the US and Britain blame for the Mumbai attacks.        
	Pakistans high commissioner to Britain, Wajid Shamsul Hasan, sparked a furore today when he said the Mumbai attacks were not planned on Pakistani soil and suggested the evidence India had handed to Islamabad linking militants in the country to the November 26-29 siege could be fabricated.        
	New Delhi is wary of moving a resolution for action against Pakistan at the UN Security Council. Sources said such a move will be treated not on the merits of the case but on political considerations.        
	India also has no plans to make innocent Pakistanis pay for a crime committed by elements in Pakistan by taking steps like suspending train and bus services.        
	Rather, India will pressure the US and other countries to tie military aid to Pakistan with action against terrorists.        
	The issue will be taken up with Richard Holbrooke, President Barack Obamas envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, who is expected to visit India soon.        
	Mumbai probe        
	High commissioner Hasan told a TV channel today: Pakistani territory was not used so far as the investigators have made their conclusions. His comments were the first from a senior Pakistani official since India handed over a dossier of evidence earlier this month.        
	Hours later, however, Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani, who is in Davos, said Hasan had spoken too soon. He cant comment at the moment when the Prime Minister cant comment.        
	In New Delhi, foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee responded angrily. We have not received any information from Pakistani authorities through proper channels. This is not the way a government can respond.

                                                                                                               Cops fast for hike
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Feb. 9: Spouses and members of Orissa Police Havildar Constable and Sepoys Confederation today went on a fast to protest against organisation apathy.         
	The confederation has over 40,000 employees  its members drawn from Orissa Police and Orissa State Armed Police  in the ranks of constables, havildars and sepoys.        
	The daylong fast was observed by all members and by their members families  whether young and old. Except for those ailing, everyone took part. Our members among the 40 platoons posted in front of the Assembly also observed the token hunger strike, said confederation president Padmanav Behera today. The confederations 47 branches observed the daylong fast in their respective areas, he added.         
	Earlier, the members had submitted a memorandum and a letter to the chief minister, Naveen Patnaik, refusing to accept the revised pay scale made according to the fitment committee report. However, neither the letter, nor the memorandum elicited any response from the government.        
	If the fast fails to evoke any response we will be forced to go for mass leave or cease work. And we will do all that before February 20, Behera said.        
	The date for further protests would be decided at the confederations general body meeting soon, he added.        
	Fitment committee report was accepted by the government in December 2008 to revise pay scales of government employees according to the recommendations of the Sixth Pay Commission. The report stated that a government constable ideally should receive a revised pay packet that was Rs 3,000 less than his counterpart at the Centre.        
	Now the confederation is demanding a monthly police service pay of Rs 1,000 for a new recruit, as is done by the Centre.         
	Members are also upset by the fact that the committee did not mention the introduction of special police as had been done for the central government police officers.        
	The Orissa Fire Service Firemen and Havildars Association president, S.N. Samal, also claimed that all its 2,000-odd members observed the fast today.         
	The fire service personnel are also agitating over non-revision of pay scales. The commitment report had made no mention of fire personnel as a result of which their pay has not been revised  commensurate to the recommendations of the Sixth Pay Commissions, Samal said.        
	This has compounded our woes. We are already deprived of statutory benefits and incentives as is the case of our counterparts in the police, he added.

                                                                                                               Pak quiz in FBI probe
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Aug. 20: The Federal Bureau of Investigation has questioned some Pakistanis after registering a case in the US involving six Americans who died in the 26/11 attacks, an FBI agent said in court today.         
	The officer told the special court hearing the terror attack trial that the US agency registers a criminal case and investigates the death of any American national in a foreign country.         
	He said the agency received a letter pertaining to last Novembers attacks from a Mumbai metropolitan court on February 10 this year, seeking its help in the investigation. I had received five Global Positioning Systems devices and one satellite phone from India, which we immediately sent to our laboratory, he told judge M.L. Tahilyani.         
	During his cross-examination by defence lawyer Abbas Kazmi, the FBI officer said the agency had interrogated some Pakistani nationals, but refused to reveal details on the ground that it could hamper the probe.         
	The officer said the FBI had also investigated the email id of Kharak Singh, a name linked with payments which were made for an Internet telephony account used by the handlers of the 26/11 terrorists.         
	Kharak Singh had subscribed to Callphonex, a New Jersey-based company, with the help of yahoo.com, and investigations were on to identify details about the person, the FBI agent said.         
	He added that the agency was looking into who had made the payment through Moneygram for the Internet telephony services used by the terrorists.        
	Earlier, the owner of Callphonex had told the court that though Kharak Singh claimed to be Indian, the payments for the Voice Over Internet Protocol (VOIP) services were made through Moneygram and Western Union Money Transfer from Pakistan by two different individuals.

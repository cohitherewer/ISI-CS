          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, April 24: Panic spread in Malkangiri as suspected Maoists gunned down a panchayat head late last night.         
	Talking to The Telegraph, Malkangiri superintendent of police Satyabrata Bhoi said the body of the former ward member and the head of Palkhonda village (Skikhpali panchayat), Kasa Madhi, 50, was found this morning.         
	Reportedly, a group of armed men called on Madhi at his residence and dragged him out around 2am towards the nearby forests, where he was allegedly gunned down.         
	However, no Maoist poster, banner or leaflet was left behind claiming responsibility, the officer said. The motive behind the incident has not been ascertained, said the SP, ruling out the political angle. Police suspect that the village head was on the rebel hit list, as he did not support the group that may have led to a suspicion of him being an informer. A combing operation has been started in the forests to nab assailants.         
	This was the third murder by suspected Maoists in recent weeks at Malkangiri. A couple of weeks ago, Somnath Madkami, a candidate of regional outfit Samruddha Odisha, was hacked to death for defying a poll boycott call.         
	Earlier, rebels had killed BJP leader Nanda Madkami after labelling him a police informer.

                                                                                                               Naveen demands flu lab
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Aug. 14: As the number of suspected swine flu cases continues to rise, the government on Friday urged the Centre to set up a laboratory to test throat and nasal swabs and blood samples in the state.         
	Orissa, which does not have a swine flu testing laboratory, has to depend on Delhi, Pune and Calcutta for results. This causes a delay in the treatment because a hospital has to wait for 72-hours for the results to arrive.         
	Orissa has not been included in the list of 18 states where the Centre has announced to set up swine flu testing laboratories.         
	The demand was made at a meeting between visiting central nodal officer for H1N1 A.K. Mishra and chief minister Naveen Patnaik at the secretariat. Mishra, however, remained non-committal on the matter. So far, no confirmed case of H1N1 has been found in Orissa.         
	Later, talking to reporters, he admitted that 40 to 50 samples are tested everyday in Calcutta creating extra pressure on the laboratory.

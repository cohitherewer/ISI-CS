                                                                                                               BJP dishes out gravy and gravitas     -  History lessons in poll statement 
          SANJAY K. JHA                                                
	New Delhi, April 3: You could have mistaken it for a treatise on Indias civilisation and heritage.        
	The foreword to the BJP manifesto, written by Murli Manohar Joshi, laboured in total disconnect with contemporary politics, rambling through a maze of ancient history to unearth the glories and wisdom of our forefathers.        
	It is unfortunate that the leaders of Independent India quickly discarded this vision and continued to work with the institutional structures created by the British which had nothing to do with Indias worldview and its vitality which were responsible for its survival despite continued outside attacks and alien rule, Joshi rued.        
	The saga of Indian knowledge and morality, told through the quotes of Megasthenes, Fa-Hien and Macaulay, almost suggested this document was unrelated to the political battle of 2009.        
	But then came a downpour of populism and political brinkmanship, providing a rude awakening from Joshis five-page trance. Amid the welfare schemes and sops, the BJP unveiled its three primary goals: good governance, development and security.        
	Apart from the usual pre-election rhetoric, the manifesto had a few new proposals. For instance, a quota for the economically backward among the upper castes, tax exemption for the armed forces, mandatory ratification of international treaties by Parliament, a pension scheme for old farmers and a system of holding Assembly and parliamentary elections together.        
	On the nuclear deal, it stuck to its known position, arguing the pact was not about empowering India but (about) disempowering India by making the country dependent on US supplies and tying it to discriminatory regimes from which Pakistan is free.        
	The BJP promised to keep all options open for the advancement of Indias civil and nuclear programmes and stressed the need to promote thorium use. It promised to amend the Constitution to make Parliaments ratification mandatory for international treaties that impacted on Indias strategic programmes and territorial integrity.        
	On Pakistan, the manifesto did not offer anything substantially different from the Congress. It promised coercive measures, including diplomacy, and made the cessation of anti-India activities a pre-condition for resumption of dialogue.        
	Among the pet issues the BJP reaffirmed were deportation of illegal immigrants, national identity cards for all, a better anti-terror law than Pota, strengthening of intelligence networks and a new education policy.        
	A typo at the end, however, spoilt some of the gravitas of the opening. The manifesto, which wound up with a poem by Tagore, substituted wars for walls in the line Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls.

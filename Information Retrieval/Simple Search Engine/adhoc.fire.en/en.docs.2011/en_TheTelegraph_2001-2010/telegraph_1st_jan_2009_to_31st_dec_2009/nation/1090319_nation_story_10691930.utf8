                                                                                                               Starve, but spare the courts 
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                      The Supreme Court: Not a matter of right                          
	New Delhi, March 18: Every starving person cannot move courts to get food from the government as a matter of right, the Supreme Court has said.        
	Delivering a judgment involving Assam, a two-judge bench yesterday ignored an earlier top court order directing Bihar to pay salaries to starving employees of state-owned sick companies.        
	Justices R.V. Raveendran and Markandey Katju said the order in Bihars Kapila Hingorani case was not a binding precedent though it had been passed on humanitarian grounds.        
	The judges then overturned a Gauhati High Court ruling that had drawn on the Bihar case and had ordered Assam to give an ailing company bailout money for distribution among staff.        
	 it (the Hingorani case) may lead to every disadvantaged group or every citizen or every unemployed person facing extreme hardship approaching this court or the high court alleging human right violations and seeking a mandamus requiring the state to provide him or them an allowance for meeting food, shelter, clothing, salary, medical treatment and education, if not more, the bench said.        
	Yesterdays order goes against earlier rulings that said the state should always come to the help of the starving, unemployed and the weak.        
	In the Bihar case, the court had  at the behest of Hingorani, a social worker  ensured salaries were paid to starving employees. It had earlier stepped in to feed the people of Kalahandi district also.        
	In June 2001, Gauhati High Court had on an appeal by Barak Upatyaka D.U. Karmachari Sanstha, a trade union, directed Assam to help the ailing Cachar and Karimganj District Milk Producers Co-operative Union Limited.        
	The high court had said since the co-operative was always run by a government bureaucrat, it was liable to pay the salaries of the employees pending since 1994.        
	But Assam refused to extend any further grant-in-aid on the ground that earlier grants were not repaid by the co-operative. It then moved the Supreme Court.

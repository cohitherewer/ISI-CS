	New Delhi, May 24: Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi held a meeting this evening at the Prime Ministers Race Course Road residence to discuss the ministry expansion lined up for this week.

	Sources said that from the Congress, only ministers of state would take oath in the next round of swearing-in, which could be held on Tuesday if a deal is worked out with the DMK by then.

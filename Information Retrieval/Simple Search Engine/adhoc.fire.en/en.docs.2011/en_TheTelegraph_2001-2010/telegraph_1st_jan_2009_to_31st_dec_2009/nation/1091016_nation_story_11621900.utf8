The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Self-rule cry after PC offer
                                                                                                               Self-rule cry after PC offer
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Srinagar, Oct. 15: The Centres offer of a unique solution to the Kashmir dispute has spurred the states two main parties into pitching old proposals that they hope will now carry more weight in Delhi.        
	The ruling National Conference (NC) is rooting for more autonomy, while the rival Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) favours self-rule.        
	Home minister P. Chidambaram had yesterday reached out to the separatists, saying the Centre would restart the dialogue with every section in Kashmir because the states unique geography and history needed a unique solution.        
	The NCs point was made today by chief minister Omar Abdullah, who revived the autonomy theme and reminded the Centre that restoring it is not about creating a sovereign state within a nation.        
	It (autonomy) is about addressing and accommodating diversity. Retaining some form of sovereignty is required to empower the people of Jammu and Kashmir not only to get a fair share of national power and resources but also to be able to withstand and benefit from the new economic regime of globalisation, Omar said.         
	Autonomy will address genuine issues of identity, borders and governance, he said, adding it will prevent issues from escalating and taking the form of nation, territory and statehood in a way that sows seeds of secession.        
	Omars statement assumes significance against the backdrop of events that took place nine years ago. In 2000, the NC government had passed an autonomy resolution in the Assembly but it was rejected by the BJP-led NDA, which dubbed the move anti-national saying it would create a state within the state.        
	The NCs autonomy proposal leaves four subjects  defence, foreign policy, currency and communications  with the Centre.        
	The PDP believes the answer lies in self-rule, a theme echoed by former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf but to which the party has made significant changes. The PDPs position was put forward by former chief minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed.        
	Self-rule will effectively remove the sense of siege that has gripped the state post-1947. It will also lead to a virtual reunion of the two sides (two parts of Kashmir) separated by (the) LoC, Sayeed said.        
	The PDPs self-rule proposal seeks, besides greater autonomy, a dual currency regime  Indian and Pakistani currencies  in the state. It also wants a common legislative council set up for the two parts of Kashmir, with members from both sides.

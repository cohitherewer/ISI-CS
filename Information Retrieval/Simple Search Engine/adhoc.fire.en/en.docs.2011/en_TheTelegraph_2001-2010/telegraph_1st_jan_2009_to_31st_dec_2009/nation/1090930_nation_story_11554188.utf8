          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 29: Incessant rains dampened the Puja spirit in the coastal belt even as Met officials warned of heavy rain for another 48 hours with a cyclonic system developing in the Bay of Bengal.        
	A low pressure area formed over the west-central Bay and adjoining north-west Bay off north Andra Pradesh and south Orissa coast has led to the rains, said weathermen.        
	Heavy downpour continued to lash most parts of the state, including Bhubaneswar and Cuttack, forcing people to stay indoor.        
	Immersion of idols scheduled to start at 3pm in Bhubaneswar got delayed by more than four hours and had not begun till 6pm. Despite the best efforts of the organisers in starting processions, city roads witnessed a thin turnout as most people did not venture out to bid adieu to the goddess in the rain.        
	Yesterday too, spells of rain since morning played spoilsport at the Ravan dahan, hugely disappointing the audience after effigies of Ravan, Meghnad and Kumbhakarna refused to catch fire following the shower.        
	We had made massive arrangements for this years Ravan dahan and were expecting a good gathering but bad weather in the evening spoiled our plans, said an organiser.        
	Meanwhile, the Met office today forecast more heavy rainfall at isolated places over south Orissa during the next 48 hours. Under the influence, a gusty surface wind from northeasterly direction with a speed reaching from 45/55kmph to 65kmph is likely to sweep past along and off the Orissa coast, said S. Mishra, the local Met office director.

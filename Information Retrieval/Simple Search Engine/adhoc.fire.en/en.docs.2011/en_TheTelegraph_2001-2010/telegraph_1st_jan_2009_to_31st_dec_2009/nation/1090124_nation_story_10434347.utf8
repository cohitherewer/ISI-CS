	New Delhi, Jan. 23: When it was suggested to Pranab Mukherjee last year that he was Number Two in the cabinet, he was not amused.        
	Number Two? I was Number Two to Mrs Indira Gandhi! I dont have to be called a Number Two now, he said.        
	Since the Mumbai terrorist attacks, Mukherjee has been the face of the government at home and to the world. Today, he was officially acknowledged first among equals because the Prime Minister will undergo heart surgery.         
	Sonia Gandhi also reconciled herself to Mukherjees position after publicly scotching speculation that the government would not have a deputy Prime Minister when there were inspired reports that the veteran from Bengal merited a more substantive status than being another minister in the Manmohan Singh cabinet.                    
	But sections of the Congress were not convinced that Mukherjee had filled the trust deficit that supposedly exists between him and the party president.        
	They said that if Singh fought fit after his surgery and the Congress was in a position to lead the UPA coalition again, Sonia would root for him.        
	With a caveat. If the Congress independently won 160 to 180 seats and could be a stronger nucleus than it was in 2004, there was a good chance that Rahul Gandhi could be the prime ministerial candidate.        
	A leader put the Sonia-Mukherjee-Singh triangle in perspective.         
	The Congress president is an excellent human resource manager. She spots skills and talent and uses them effectively. She knows Mukherjee is a repository of political and parliamentary wisdom, a good political manager and strategist and doesnt live in a time warp. He understands contemporary issues as well as history. She has tapped his strengths. But she doesnt share the same comfort level with him that she does with Singh, the leader said.        
	So, the response among Congress circles to Mukherjees elevation was: Finally, Dada has made it to the top, if only for a few weeks. He deserves it.        
	The question bothering the Congress was that if Singh wasnt fit enough to take the top job again and Rahul was unprepared, who then? Few were prepared to slot Mukherjee as an obvious choice.        
	Sonia, they claimed, had not taken too kindly to the Lefts pressure to make him the UPAs presidential candidate in 2007. So, if the Congress had to take the Lefts support again, sources said, it was highly unlikely that Sonia would let its leaders dictate who the Prime Minister ought to be.        
	The response to P. Chidambarams name was as ambivalent. Although he continued to enjoy the Congress first familys trust, even when he was with the breakaway Tamil Maanila Congress and later an outfit he floated, there was a view that he was too junior to be considered, notwithstanding his brilliance.        
	A.K. Antony was dismissed out of hand. The other leaders looked at with a degree of seriousness, for distinct reasons, were Digvijay Singh and Sushil Kumar Shinde.        
	Digvijay, who had two stints as chief minister, was left out in the cold after his detractors let it be known that he was not content to be just another general-secretary.         
	But, like Mukherjee, it was unclear where he stood vis-a-vis Sonia, though Rahul was said to regard highly his political sagacity.        
	Shinde could be seemingly lacking Manmohan Singhs vision, knowledge and understanding. But he is said to be a Sonia favourite with a trump card: he is a Dalit.         
	But being a loyal member of a non-casteist party, he never leveraged his caste antecedents to his advantage.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Sonia in balancing act on Pak
                                                                                                               Sonia in balancing act on Pak
          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi, July 30: Sonia Gandhi today to tried to cap the reported disquiet in the Congress over the joint statement with Pakistan by focusing on the Prime Ministers assertion that talks would not be held unconditionally.         
	The Congress president endorsed Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs statement in the Lok Sabha yesterday but reinforced the position that the party had not changed its stand.        
	The Prime Minister has made a firm and unequivocal statement in the Lok Sabha yesterday on all major policy issues, in particular, our relations with Pakistan. No one should be in any doubt on our partys position vis-a-vis Pakistan. It remains unchanged, Sonia said.        
	She stressed that the dialogue process would resume only after it (Pakistan) has demonstrated its seriousness to bring the perpetrators of the Mumbai terror attacks to justice, and to prevent its territory from being used to launch terror attacks.        
	In her address to the Congress parliamentary party this morning, Sonia steered clear of mentioning the joint statement and the reference to Balochistan. This was a point the BJP had raised repeatedly during the two-day discussion on foreign policy issues in Parliament and walked out saying the government hadnt offered a convincing explanation.        
	Sections of the Congress were uncomfortable with the allusion to Balochistan. They wondered why India did not add its own version to it and find a proper context in the joint statement. Although no leader bought the BJPs charge of a sellout, they were said to have privately asked if the Prime Minister had given his Pakistani counterpart, Yousaf Raza Gilani, a face-saver to restart talks.        
	Congress sources said Sonias self-assigned brief was to defend the Prime Minister and restate the partys line on Pakistan. The aim was to remove any impression that the party was about to soften its position and barter away Indias sovereign stand.         
	Sources said a statement on Balochistan, however neutral, had the potential of being misread by the BJP and blown up. She did not want to add to the controversy, a source said.         
	Rahul Gandhi, though, batted strongly for the Prime Minister and scotched reports of differences. The government and party are absolutely one on the joint statement. You media have created such an impression, he said.        
	However, the BJP seemed to have convinced itself that Singh and Sonia were at odds over the joint statement.        
	Sushma Swaraj claimed Singh had failed to convince Sonia and this was reflected in the Congress presidents address to party MPs today. Sushma pointed out that though Sonia praised Singhs speech, she did not mention the joint statement.        
	Sushma said none of her partys concerns had been answered by Singh. She tried to rebut the parallel Singh had drawn with former BJP Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayees efforts to keep the Indo-Pak dialogue on track despite Kargil and Kandahar. She said Vajpayee had kept the focus on terrorism.        
	Apart from Sushma, other BJP leaders did not target Singh. Murli Manohar Joshi held a news conference to argue that the G8 view on enrichment and reprocessing was a bigger issue than Balochistan.

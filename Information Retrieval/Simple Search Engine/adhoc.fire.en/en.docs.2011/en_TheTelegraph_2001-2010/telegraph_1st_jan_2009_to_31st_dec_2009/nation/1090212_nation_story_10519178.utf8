          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 11: Opposition members today climbed the Speakers podium to stall the proceedings of the Assembly, after the Speaker rejected a no-trust motion moved against the Naveen Patnaik government.        
	Speaker Kishore Kumar Mohanty was forced to adjourn the House for an hour in view of the pandemonium. As soon as the business started this morning, Opposition chief whip Satya Bhusan Sahu said its members had submitted a notice expressing intention to move no- confidence motion against the government. Sahu wanted a ruling from the Chair on the matter.         
	Mohanty said he had received the notice and would give his ruling on the matter later. He then proceeded with question-answer session and called rural development minister Biswa Bhusan Harichandan to give reply to a listed question.         
	However, the agitated members trooped into the well and caused uproar, demanding immediate ruling from the Chair.         
	Some of them stood on Assembly reporters table, while an angry Tara Prasad Bahinipati from the Congress tried to climb the Speakers podium.

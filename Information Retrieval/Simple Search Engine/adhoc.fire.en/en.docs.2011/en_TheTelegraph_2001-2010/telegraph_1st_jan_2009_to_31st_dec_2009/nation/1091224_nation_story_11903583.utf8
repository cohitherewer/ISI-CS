          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 23: Human resource development minister Kapil Sibal today dismissed two controversial proposals in a Planning Commission blueprint for public-private partnerships in school education.         
	But the HRD ministry and the commission failed to reach a consensus on key financial aspects of the UPAs ambitious plan to fund schooling through PPP investments  and postponed the decision to the next year.         
	The plan approved by cabinet involves using PPP investments to set up and run 2,500 exemplary secondary schools  one in each district  for students starting Class IX.         
	But the Planning Commission in the blueprint suggested expanding the ambit of these schools to cover students from Class I. In contrast to the cabinet-approved plan, the commission also proposed that the schools not be limited to backward rural areas but include poorer parts of cities.         
	At a meeting with a panel of experts and the commission, Sibal today dismissed both these suggestions.         
	But a slew of objections raised by the HRD ministry and other experts on the panel  picked by the ministry  on the commissions strategy to fund the PPP proposal will only be discussed at a fresh meeting on January 11.         
	The HRD ministry fears that the Planning Commission blueprint contains loopholes that could allow private partners to minimise their own investment, depend largely on government funds while retaining day-to-day management reins of the schools.

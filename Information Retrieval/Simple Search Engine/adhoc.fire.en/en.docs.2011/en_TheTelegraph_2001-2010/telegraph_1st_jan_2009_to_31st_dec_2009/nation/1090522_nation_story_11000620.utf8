The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Teacher crunch in state
                                                                                                               Teacher crunch in state
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Mentors missing                                  
	Cuttack, May 21: The Orissa governments decision to offer Class VIII in 5,616 upper primary and primary schools, under the centrally-sponsored Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan from 2009, has received a lukewarm response from teachers of secondary institutions.        
	Members of Orissa Secondary School Teachers Association are worried that the governments attempt to universalise education will only worsen the quality of academics. The association also believes that the government is not being realistic in its approach because before they decide to add extra classes, the infrastructure in existing schools should be upgraded and more teachers should be trained. In a way, teachers state, parents preference for private English-medium schools and Saraswati Vidya Mandirs, is justified.         
	The association general secretary, Kishore Panda, stressed that the state government was still dragging its feet when it came to the appointment of teachers. The introduction of Class VIII in all primary schools in 1,083 panchayats by 2009 would prove to be disastrous.        
	Of the 53,818 primary schools, nearly 13,000 are of upper-primary level (till Classes VI and VII).         
	While 39 per cent of primary schools (Classes I to V) are run by two teachers, nearly 50 per cent of the upper-primary schools are also run by two teachers.         
	It is ridiculous that the government should expect teachers trained for primary schools to manage the job of teaching higher classes in mathematics, science and English, said Panda talking to The Telegraph.         
	At least 10,000 trained teachers need to be appointed before the introduction of Class VIII in the upper-primary schools, he said.         
	School and mass education department officials admitted that at least 9 lakh children continue to remain deprived of elementary education in the state, because they have no schools to enrol in. Most of these 9 lakh children are between the age group of five and 10 years and 6 lakh of them are girls.         
	Though there are estimated 54 lakh children in the eligible age group, only 45 lakh are enrolled in schools. The education experience has been no better for those who were availing primary level lessons in the state.         
	While 734 primary schools have no classrooms, 6,509 of them run Classes III, IV and V in single rooms and 13,061 have only two rooms.         
	Large numbers of children have no choice but to give up education after Class V, as there are not enough schools with Classes VI and VII, officials of school and mass education department said.

  - PMs most active day after bypass, doctors happy with recovery        OUR BUREAU                          Singh before a meeting with Benin President Boni Yayi in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)                                              
	New Delhi, March 4: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today met a visiting African President and home minister P. Chidambaram in what officials described as his most active day at work since his heart surgery five weeks ago.         
	In his first official engagement since his bypass surgery on January 24, Singh held talks for about 90 minutes with President Boni Yayi from Benin, and oversaw the signing of three agreements between India and Benin.         
	Doctors attending to the Prime Minister said they were happy with his pace of recovery. Hes been going to his office at 7 Race Course Road since Monday. There are no restrictions on his activity, a member of his medical team said.         
	Sources in the Prime Ministers Office said Singh displayed no trace of strain, but was cheerful and appeared to enjoy the meetings.         
	After the official engagements, Singh also cleared several files, as he has been doing for the past few days  initially from his home, and from his office since Monday. He held wide-ranging discussions with Chidambaram, the sources said.         
	Congress sources said the Prime Minister had expressed his desire to attend to political work, such as strategy sessions and the central election committee meeting. Doctors, who had said earlier Singh would be able to resume normal activity between six and eight weeks after the surgery, said he was now in a position to determine his own pace of activity.         
	Cardiologists who were in his medical and surgical team said they expected Singh would be able to travel and campaign in the coming weeks. He can travel and campaign, but how much would be up to him, one of the team members said.         
	The state of his heart six weeks after surgery will be better than the state of the heart six weeks before the surgery, a senior cardiologist said.         
	A joint team from Mumbais Asian Heart Institute and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences had conducted a repeat coronary artery bypass surgery on Singh at the AIIMS on January 24 to remove five blockages in his arteries.         
	Doctors who had recommended that Singh consider a bypass rather than an angiography with stents to clear his blockages today cited a new medical study that appeared to vindicate their decision.         
	The study, one of the largest to compare results of bypass surgeries with the results of angiography with stents when multiple blood vessels are blocked, has found higher rates of repeat blockages in patients who had received stents.         
	Coronary artery bypass should remain the standard of care in patients with three-vessel or left main coronary disease or both, European and American doctors have said in the New England Journal of Medicine.         
	The rate of repeat blockages occurring in one of the vessels a year after the treatment was about 14 per cent among patients who had received stents in contrast to about 5 per cent among patients who had undergone coronary bypass surgery.

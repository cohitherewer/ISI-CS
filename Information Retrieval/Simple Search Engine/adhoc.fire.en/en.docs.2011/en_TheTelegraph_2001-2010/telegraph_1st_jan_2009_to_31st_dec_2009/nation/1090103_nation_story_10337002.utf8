The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Ordinance to hike judge salaries
                                                                                                               Ordinance to hike judge salaries
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 2: The Union cabinet today decided to bring in an ordinance to hike the salaries of Supreme Court and high court judges three-fold.         
	The cabinet has decided to promulgate an ordinance to that effect, science and technology minister Kapil Sibal said. Consequently, the pension that judges receive would also be upwardly revised, he said.        
	After the pay revision, the Chief Justice of India will get Rs 1 lakh a month instead of Rs 33,000 he gets now. Other apex court judges and chief justices of high courts will get Rs 90,000, up from Rs 30,000 a month. High court judges who get Rs 26,000 will get Rs 80,000. The pay does not include allowances and official accommodation.         
	The hike became necessary after a recent salary revision for central government staff announced by the Sixth Pay Commission. Junior court staff would have earned as much as, if not more than, the judges.         
	But the bill to hike judges pay could not be passed in the last House session, compelling the government to bring an ordinance.

          GAJINDER SINGH                              
	Chandigarh, July 23: A 21-year-old man was lynched in a Haryana village in front of his 12 police escorts last night after he ignored a kangaroo courts diktat to divorce his wife.        
	Ved Pal had married Sonia against her parents wishes and the khap panchayat (caste council) in Singhwal, Sonias village, had refused to let him take her home since the couple were from the same gotra or clan.        
	On March 20, the council asked Pal, who is from the neighbouring village of Matuar, to divorce Sonia and begin treating her as a sister.        
	Pal, however, secured an order from Punjab and Haryana High Court that Sonia be allowed to live with him and entered Singhwal with a warrant officer and a dozen policemen.

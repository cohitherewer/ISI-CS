          OUR CORRESPONDENT       
	Cuttack, March 20: A petition was filed in Orissa High Court for disqualification of three BJP MLAs on the ground of defection to BJD.         
	Karindra Majhi, the BJP legislator from Baliguda, filed the petition contending that the three MLAs  Mahesh Sahu (Talcher), Dhaneswar Majhi (Kesinga) and Pramila Giri (Boisinga)  had incurred disqualification under the anti-defection law.        
	The petition has been filed under Schedule X of the Constitution (anti-defection law) on the ground that the MLAs had voluntarily given up their membership of their party and joined the BJD, the petitioners counsel, Sushanta Das said today.        
	They are not eligible to participate in any proceedings in the House although they took part in the trust vote on March 11, Das said.

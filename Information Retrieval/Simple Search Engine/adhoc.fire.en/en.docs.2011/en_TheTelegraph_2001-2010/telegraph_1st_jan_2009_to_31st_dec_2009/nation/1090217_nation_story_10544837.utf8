	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 16: President of National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) Ganesh Natarajan believes that cities such as Bhubaneswar should cash in on the economic downturn and shape itself as a global IT destination.         
	Addressing a national IT conclave  Destination Bhubaneswar  today, Natarajan said, the capital city was shaping itself as an upcoming destination for the IT crowd with its urban infrastructure, cost competitiveness and a pool of technical manpower.         
	Orissa has the opportunity to shape a world-class IT and BPO workforce, accelerate digital and physical infrastructure, focus on infrastructure to attract global citizens to live and work in the state and market Bhubaneswar as a global IT destination, said Natarajan.         
	At the programme, the IT boss was all praises for the state government. Such steps as taken by you are necessary to attract fresh, middle and senior level talent to Bhubaneswar.         
	Nasscom has been working hand-in-hand with the Central government to ensure that the impact of global meltdown does not leave a cascading effect on the Indian economy. Natarajan, who also happens to be the global CEO of Zensar Technologies, announced that the company would set up a centre in Bhubaneswar.         
	Presiding over the conclave, state information technology secretary P.K. Mohapatra said the recent Nasscom-AT Kearney study on location roadmap for IT-BPO growth had identified Bhubaneswar as one of the better locations.         
	Today Orissa is ranked ninth in the country in software exports with an average growth rate over 35 per cent  achieved in the past two years. Though we can not ignore the current financial meltdown, we are hopeful that we would be able to maintain the growth in the coming years, said Mohapatra.         
	The Infocity IT SEZ was the first operational one in the state and one of the biggest in the eastern region. The other three IT SEZs  Mindspace IT Park by K Raheja Group, Info Park by DLF and Info Valley IT SEZ by Orissa Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation  were in different stages of implementation.         
	We are coming up with Orissa Computer Application Centre tower with affordable world class plug-and-play space to cater to the requirements of IT and ITES units. This would also help entrepreneurs to reach quick start ups, he added.        
	Todays inaugural function was followed by a panel discussion attended by state IIIT director Gopal Nayak, former RPG board member P.K. Mohapatra, CEO of Global Talent Track Uma Ganesh, vice-president and head of talent management of Zensar Technologies Prameela Kalive and state IT director Vishal Dev.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Jharkhand unity show after personal twist
                                                                                                                                 2                                                                                      Jharkhand unity show after personal twist
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Rajiv Pratap Rudy                          
	New Delhi, Dec. 28: The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, BJP and the Janata Dal (United) today put up a show of unity that BJP spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudy tried to unstitch by stating that it would do his party no good because it did not have the mandate to rule.         
	Rudys comments threatened to cast a shadow on the prospective coalitions durability even before it came into being.        
	Shibu Soren, the putative chief minister, first flew to Mumbai to meet BJP president Nitin Gadkari, who instantly began a damage-control exercise by claiming that Rudys statements were twisted out of context.        
	Rudy was directed to clarify his remarks made at a meeting of the RSSs student wing, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, in Calcutta on December 26.        
	He claimed the comment reflected his personal views and was made before the BJPs parliamentary board had taken a call on supporting Sorens JMM. Three options were being thought of. Should we sit in the Opposition? Should we support a government from outside or should we be part of it? I was merely answering a question on what a party with strong ideological moorings like the BJP should do when it does not get a clear mandate, Rudy explained.        
	In Bhopal, Sushma Swaraj, who was recently made the leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, endorsed Sorens leadership, saying he was no longer a tainted person.        
	Late this evening, Soren landed in the capital and drove to the residence of Sharad Yadav, the Dal(U) leader and NDA convener. They addressed the media with Sudesh Mahato, the All Jharkhand Students Union president, Yashwant Sinha, the BJP MP from Hazaribagh, Raghubar Das, the Jharkhand BJP president, in an apparent re-affirmation of their solidarity.         
	Soren was later expected to call on L.K. Advani, chairman of the BJP parliamentary party.        
	Questions flew thick and fast on how the BJP could align itself with a person who had figured high on its list of tainted politicos when Soren was a minister in the UPAs first tenure.         
	Sinha explained: The fundamental difference between this coalition and the earlier ones is that its core is made up of political parties. The JMM, BJP and Ajsu are hard-core political parties and will, therefore, give a government that will last its term. The two or three Independents who have come on board have promised to give us unconditional support. Let us not forget that the previous government lived on the mercy of a few Independents.        
	Sinha also announced that the government would run on the basis of a common agreed agenda that would be worked on shortly.         
	Asked if Soren and the Ajsu would become part of the NDA, Yadav said: That will be considered later.        
	BJP sources said according to the power-sharing formula mutually agreed upon, the BJP and the JMM would get four cabinet berths each, the Ajsu two and the Dal(U) one. The BJP has also managed to wangle the Speakers post.        
	It is not known if Gadkari would be in Ranchi when the ministers take oath of office on December 30 or ask predecessor Rajnath Singh to represent him.        
	A Raj Bhavan communiqu said Soren had been asked to take a floor test by January 8.

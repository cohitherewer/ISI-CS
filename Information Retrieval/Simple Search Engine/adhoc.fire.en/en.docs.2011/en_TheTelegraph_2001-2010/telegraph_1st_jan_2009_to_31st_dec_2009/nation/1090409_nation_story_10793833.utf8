The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | JD(U) softens saffron tone
                                                                                                               JD(U) softens saffron tone
          NALIN VERMA                      Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar                          
	Patna, April 8: The JD(U) manifesto that its leadership is set to release soon reflects the partys well charted out effort to present itself different from the BJP  its 13- year-old ally.        
	For the first time in its 11-year alliance history, the BJP released its manifesto before the JD(U).        
	The tone of JD(U)s manifesto becomes clearer with Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar refusing to not share dais with BJP star leader and Gurajat counterpart Narendra Modi.         
	Nitish has stressed that he feels no need to share the dais with the Gujarat CM and seems to be conscious of his secular image. I will accompany L.K. Advani when the latter campaigns in Bihar. But, otherwise, I understand that the Bihar BJP leaders are sufficient to do the job.        
	The JD(U) manifesto does not mention Ayodhya, Ram setu, uniform civil code or Article 370 issues anywhere in it  items that are the focus of the BJP manifesto working on the Hindu plank.        
	The JD(U) manifesto instead dwells heavily on how the Nitish Kumar-led government has ensured safety and security to all communities (emphasising on the Bhagalpur verdict).         
	Besides, the manifesto mentions measures taken up to improve living conditions of minorities, including monthly pension to riot victims, reviving the weaving industry and fencing of graveyards. It promises more welfare measures for Muslims.         
	The manifesto enumerates on the governments measures in successfully improving the law and order situation and creating a climate for investment in the state, for reserving seats for women and Extremely Backward Classes in government institutions.        
	The manifesto promises further schemes for the states agriculture sector  still the mainstay of the states economy  roads in every village, power and drinking water to every home.        
	Besides, it promises administrative reforms to ensure better governance, all-inclusive growth  a Nitish mantra  more technical and vocational educational institutions and improving medical sector across the state.        
	JD(U) cadre believe that Nitish has also played a role in de-communalising the Bihar unit of the BJP and that state BJP leaders would rather support Bihar chief minister in advocating action against Varun Gandhi, rather than join the chorus seeking justice for the BJP Pilibhit nominee. So far, no BJP leader in Bihar has disagreed to Nitishs opposition to Narendra Modi campaigning in Bihar.  
	Gaya: Chief minister Nitish Kumar, on Wednesday, demanded his wage in terms of vote for the work done by him in the state in the past three-and-a-half years. 
  Addressing an election meeting in Raniganj under the Imamganj police station area, a part of the Aurangabad parliamentary constituency, Nitish said that the NDA government has done much to bring Bihar back to the rails. 
  Nitish Kumar appealed to the electorate to vote for the JD(U) candidate Sushil Singh. And for NDA prime ministerial candidate L.K. Advani. Interestingly, he ignored the Naxalite problem, despite the fact that the Imamganj area was a Naxalite stronghold and just a few hours before the CM rsquo;s arrival, rebels blew up a school-cum-cluster centre in the neighbouring area.

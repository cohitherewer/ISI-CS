The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Maoist barb from Lalu, help from govt
                                                                                                               Maoist barb from Lalu, help from govt
          OUR BUREAU                          Lalu Prasad and (right) Nitish Kumar                                  
	New Delhi/Patna, Oct. 2: The bad news for Nitish Kumar is that the Centre fears more Maoist attacks in Bihar.        
	The better news is, he is likely to get all the help he needs at a time the Centre is readying its biggest ever offensive against the rebels. Bihar, being one of the seven worst-hit states, lies near the focus of that country-wide operation, which could be weeks away.        
	Union home ministry officials said the Maoists, lying low in Bihar for sometime, were expected to step up attacks in the state, especially in the riverine, difficult-to-access north. This region had been outside their gunsight till they mowed down 16 people last night in Khagaria.        
	The officials said the rebels had been quietly working in old CPI bastion Khagaria. By proving they can strike at will, the Naxalites are sending tough signals to the government weeks before it launches the joint offensive, a source said.        
	They also need to convince their cadre that despite the recent arrests of several leaders, their movement is still going strong.        
	Nitish, facing barbs at his lame-duck government from political rivals, had till this evening not asked for CRPF deployment in Khagaria, but Delhi kept the central forces on standby.        
	The local CRPF inspector-general has been told to join the states anti-rebel operations if needed, Union home ministry sources said. Four CRPF battalions are stationed in Bihar but none is in Khagaria.         
	The Centre today stepped up its propaganda against the Maoists, saying: The killing of unarmed and innocent civilians including children seems to be the hallmark of the Maoists now.        
	Nitish faced equally acerbic attacks at home. RJD chief Lalu Prasad was first off the blocks, saying: Complete anarchy and chaos have gripped Bihar, with law and order having collapsed. His new ally from the Lok Janshakti Party, Ram Vilas Paswan, and senior RJD leader Ram Kripal Yadav were among the first to the massacre site.        
	Yet, during Lalu-Rabri rule in the 1990s, Bihar had witnessed at least 15 bloody massacres triggered by the long-drawn war between the Maoists and the Ranvir Sena, the private army of upper caste landlords.        
	However, the RJD chief, emboldened by the recent bypoll wins, has been bustling about the political scene. After a boat accident killed 50-odd people at Phultoda ghat, also in Khagaria, he and Paswan had been the first to the spot.

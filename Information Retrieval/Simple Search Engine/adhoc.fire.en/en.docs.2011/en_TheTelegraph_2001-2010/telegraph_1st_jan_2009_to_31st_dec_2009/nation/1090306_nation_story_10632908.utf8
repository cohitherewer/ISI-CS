The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | IIM way to beat downturn: go desi, earn less
                                                                                                               IIM way to beat downturn: go desi, earn less
          BASANT RAWAT                              
	Ahmedabad, March 5: The big buck financial behemoths from Wall Street swamped by the financial tsunami, the countrys premier B-school has settled for domestic big daddies and a 31 per cent drop in average salary.        
	The placement season at Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, which got under way on February 25, ended on the ninth day today with all 281 outgoing students landing jobs.         
	Last year, the batch of 255 students had been placed within five days.        
	The impact of the meltdown was sharply felt on the average salary offered this year, which came down to Rs 12.17 lakh from Rs 17.85 lakh in 2008, a drop of 31.8 per cent. The 2009 average is less than that in 2007, which recorded Rs 13.7 lakh.        
	But in spite of the crisis, finance remained the preferred choice with over 100 students opting for it. Last year, 113 students, or about 45 per cent, had taken jobs in the financial sector, which dipped to 39 per cent this year.         
	We had expected a far more drastic shift, conceded a relieved IIM-A director, Sameer Barua.        
	The largest single recruiter was the public sector Union Bank of India, which snapped up 18 graduates in its maiden foray into the campus. Sources said all the graduates were offered senior positions.        
	The salary slide could not dampen the mood on the campus, which was one of relief, both for students as well as the administrators.         
	In these turbulent times, to place all the students who wanted to be placed is in itself a big achievement, Barua said.        
	Himanshu Nema, a first-year student, was more optimistic. All of us know that it is the function of the market. There is no panic. We know it is a temporary phase. As soon as the market picks up, salaries will be back to normal, he said.         
	As many as 25 and odd first-time recruiters were in the fray, most of them Indian companies. Among them was IFMR Trust, a Chennai-based NGO, which offered two jobs.         
	Besides Union Bank, another first-time recruiter, Jaypee Capital, picked up 12 students for managing its operations in the financial and capital market  roles similar to those offered by international banks.         
	Bank of Baroda and Indian Oil recruited six and five students, respectively.        
	Consultancy firms, a favourite with IIM grads, were the choice of 24 per cent of the students. Among them were Boston-based Bain and Company (8), McKinsey and Company (8), Boston Consulting Group (7) and Frost and Sullivan (5).        
	However, the institute chose not to reveal the highest salary offered, though Barua claimed that there are several international offers worth more than Rs 1 crore.         
	The highest salary offered in 2008 was Rs 1.44 crore by a Wall Street investment bank. No one had been willing to say which, but the buzz was it was Lehman Brothers, which was on a recruitment spree. A year on, the company has been relegated to the pages of history, among the first to go bust.        
	The campus has been a favourite hunting ground for Wall Street giants  such as Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Goldman Sachs  but it was not known how many visited this year.        
	Barua said all major international recruiters, except investment banks which have collapsed, visited the campus, but admitted they made fewer offers.         
	Some of the leading recruiters did come but the offers made by them are not worth mentioning as they hired IIM-A graduates at entry level, which means a not-so-attractive compensation package, said a source in the institute.        
	Barua admitted that the institute had to work hard to invite more firms because of the volatile job market  one of the reasons why it took nine days to complete the placement process.         
	Seven students opted out of placement to start their own ventures, against 10 last year. In all, 109 firms participated in the placement process, up from 90 last year.

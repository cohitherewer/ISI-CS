          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gaya, June 15: CPI(Maoist) rebels went on a rampage early on Monday and blew up at least three government buildings in Chakarbandha village under Dumaria police station area of Gaya, near the Bihar-Jharkhand border.        
	According to reports that reached the district headquarters today, 70-odd heavily armed rebels, all men, raided the Chakarbandha village shortly after midnight and blew up a government middle school, a community hall and a panchayat bhavan building in a well co-ordinated operation.         
	After the initially fury subsided, the men blasted some more government sponsored buildings in the area in a more leisurely fashion.        
	Chakarbandha village is virtually inaccessible and the rebels, police suspect, walked 9km to reach the village from the nearest forests, said Gaya superintendent of police M.R. Naik. The village is located 24km from Dumaria police station.         
	A few months ago, a police constable and five SAP jawans were shot by rebels in Raniganj village under the neighbouring Imamganj police station area.         
	Confirming the incident, Gaya superintendent of police M.R. Naik said the blasts were a reaction to the recently held Assembly elections in the Chakarbandha village, which has been a rebel bastion and a no-election zone for years now.        
	Naik added that the Naxalites feared that these building would also be used to host police pickets in the future and thus took what they perceived as prevention.        
	The SP further said that a rebel-police encounter took place on Monday morning while a patrolling team was returning to the station near the Chakarbandha village. Though the police promptly retaliated, no casualty was reported from either side.         
	He added that a joint operation of Gaya, Aurangabad and Palamau (Jharkhand) police, would be conducted against the Naxalites.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Jan. 14: Orissa High Court today said that the former mayor and deputy mayor of Cuttack could obtain no-dues certificate by depositing Rs 22,600 against recovery notices of over Rs 9 lakh each issued by the Cuttack Municipal Corporation (CMC).        
	The money is outstanding against them as advances for over seven years. CMC had asked them to pay or face criminal and civil cases under Sections 375(1) and 376 of the Orissa Municipal Act.        
	The court ruling means that former mayor Nibedita Pradhan of BJP and deputy mayor Madhusudan Sahu of BJD can file nominations to contest the civic polls in Cuttack scheduled for February 12.        
	The recovery notices issued by the CMC is stayed pending further order of this court on February 9, the division bench of Justice I.M. Qudussi and Justice B.P. Ray said.        
	Members in the city units of BJD and BJP were reported to be jubilant at the high court ruling.        
	The former mayor and deputy mayor had asked for emergency stay on the recovery notices, arguing that operation of the notices would prevent them from obtaining the mandatory no-dues certificate to file nominations to seek re-election.         
	The last date for filing nominations is January 16.        
	Court sources said three other former members of the municipal council  Seshadev Nanda, Pravati Swain and Bijay Mohapatra, who had also filed similar petitions, were also granted the same relief.

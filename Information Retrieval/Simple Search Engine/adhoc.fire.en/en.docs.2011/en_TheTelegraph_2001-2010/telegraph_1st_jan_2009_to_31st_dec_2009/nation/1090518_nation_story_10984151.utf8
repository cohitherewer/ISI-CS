The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Nation | Lessons of 2009
                                                                                                               Lessons of 2009
                            
	What the winners and the losers can learn from the stunning verdict of this election        
	CONGRESS           Vote pullers dont have to be crowd pullers; look at the thumping endorsement for Manmohan Singh 

  It pays to play by the aam aadmi; pro-market Manmohan wasnt initially keen on NREGA, but pushed, he implemented it and it worked 

  Good governance can offset the anti-incumbency factor, indeed it can make incumbency its own reward 

  Ekla chalo re is a good idea for a party with national ambitions; piggybacking on regional allies in its traditional northern bases kept the Congress stunted for decades, going it alone has opened new prospects. It will take time and hard work, but the Congress could actually regain critical lost ground in UP and Bihar now 

  Separation of powers between government and party was an experiment in 2004; in 2009, this neo-dyarchy has become an established mode of governance. But theres a rider  it can only work with the security of complete mutual trust and support, as Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan have unflinchingly shown 
      
	BJP           Ideological confusion lands you nowhere; L.K. Advani tried to pull himself to the moderate centre, Narendra Modi remained the poster boy of the Hindu hardline and was championed as successor in the middle of Advanis summit attempt, nobody knew where the party really stood 

  It doesnt often pay to drag political battles to a personal pitch; Advanis consistent and sharp attacks on Manmohan as weak and ineffective backfired

  Personal ambition is never quite enough to propel a party to power; in focusing too hard on his bid for prime ministership, Advani often ignored critical concerns of the party itself. As the campaign got off, the BJP appeared riven with factionalism and personal feuding and lost cohesion and discipline, once its USP 

  It is not enough to attack your opponent, it is probably more important to articulate an alternative, and positive, worldview of your own; Advani and the BJP failed to convince the electorate why they were seeking change 
      
	LEFT          It is key to have your house in order before you launch a charge on the enemy fortress; the CPM ignored deepening crises in both Kerala and Bengal to fight Cold War-era ghosts of imperialism in Delhi 

  Pragmatism and political flexibility (of the kind that the late CPM boss and Karats predecessor Harkishen Singh Surjeet practised) might work much better than outmoded ideological rigidity 

  There is such a thing as anti-incumbency in democracies, and once it begins to work, it unravels fast; 32 years in power in Bengal is an unmatched record, but it offers small cause to the CPM to live in denial. Assembly elections are not too far, and Mamata is closing in 
      
	LALU/ PASWAN           Caste is not always thicker than calibre; Nitish Kumar may have benefited from eating into the old Lalu Prasad vote base, but equally he has gained from delivering on the promise of governance. Arithmetic is a handy tactic in caste-riven societies, but two plus two do not always add up to four 

  There is a fine and treacherous line between confidence and complacency; in humiliating the Congress on seat-sharing and driving it away, Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan displayed an arrogance that turned out utterly misplaced 

  Never take the voter for granted, a personal lesson for Guinness record-holder Paswan; he won Hajipur by Himalayan margins in the past but forgot each election is a new test, and was humbled by old veteran Ram Sunder Dass, a man he thought to be well past his prime 
      
	MAYAVATI           Littering the realm with Soviet-style statues of yourself doesnt quite add up to Dalit empowerment, neither is social engineering any substitute to governance; Mayavati read too much into her UP victory of two years ago and too little into her poor performance as chief minister since then
      
	MULAYAM /AMAR           Riding too hard and too long on ransom-potential can be injurious to health; the Mulayam-Amar combine had set itself up as bargainers-in-chief vis--vis the UPA on verdict eve, the results have left them surveying their errors on the periphery. Far from grabbing key portfolios, they may not even be called to join the government 

  Muslims are not their monopoly in UP, theyve gone by the bagful to the Congress this time 

  Not everything is decided in the shady backrooms of Delhi, there are the people too and their votes; Amar Singh often forgot this

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Rahul after lunching at Andhra Bhavan. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, July 22: Health freak Rahul Gandhi took a break from steamed chicken and vegetables to tuck into red-hot and spicy fried food today at Andhra Pradesh Bhavan, not far from Parliament.        
	Bhavan regulars, who include MPs from the southern state, were surprised to see a familiar SUV and a posse of security guards drive into the complex this afternoon. They went into a tizzy when they saw Rahul step out, accompanied by Alwar MP and political aide Jitendra Singh. They were told Rahul had come for lunch.        
	Rahul and Singh, an MP said, looked a bit lost because this was the first time they were visiting the Bhavan, a must-visit on every food guide in the capital. The duo were escorted to the air-conditioned dining hall on the first floor that is reserved for politicians, officials and journalists  the last group on request.        
	The Bhavans menu is limited: a standard vegetarian thali with separate non-veg fare on order. Singh, a veggie, stuck to the thali but Rahul also ordered three servings of fried fish, mutton and chicken and a bowl of chicken curry.        
	He asked for phulkas but was told by the waiter that only pooris were served for lunch. Rahul said it was fine by him but before he was through with his second poori, specially made phulkas arrived from the kitchen. He also dug into the vegetables, which included roasted arbi, steamed spinach, fried kundru and dal with greens. The spoon was abandoned for the finger.        
	Rahul skipped the biryani and the rice but took a few sips of the rasam that is leavened with spices, including a stiff dose of pepper. He didnt touch the semiya halwa, nor was he adventurous enough to sample the pickles and chutneys that came with the meal.         
	After the meal, Rahul asked for the bill, which the steward refused to give. Rahul asked him if he wanted him to visit again, and thrust a few hundreds in his hand.

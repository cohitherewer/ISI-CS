          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Patna, Jan. 4: A 14-member central team has been assessing the damage caused by the floods in five Bihar districts on Indo-Nepal border in response to the state governments demand for a Rs 14,000-crore special package to rebuild devastated homes, schools and other facilities in the Kosi region.        
	The team, headed by Union ministry of home affairs joint secretary Sadakant, has been inspecting the devastated structures and meeting affected people even as the state government had launched the second phase of relief operations to provide food and blanket to displaced people.        
	Sources in the disaster management department said that the government from tomorrow onwards would pay Rs 1,590 in cash to each of the displaced families to enable them buy foodgrain of their choice from the Food Corporation of India (FCI) shops at reasonable rates.        
	Besides, the affected families would be paid Rs 250 more for buying blankets to cover themselves as cold wave has been sweeping Bihar for the past three days.         
	Several families which had their homes and crops thoroughly washed out are still living in relief camps in Saharsa and Madhepura districts since August.        
	Prime minister Manmohan Singh, who visited the affected areas last year, had described the floods as national calamity and subsequently released Rs 1,000 crore for the relief operations.        
	Soon after chief minister Nitish Kumar met the Prime Minister and submitted him a memorandum and demanded a special package of Rs 14,000 crore for rebuilding areas which had all its schools, houses, community halls, roads, agricultural infrastructure and crops obliterated.         
	JD-U president Sharad Yadav followed up on Nitishs demand by submitting another memorandum to Singh mentioning similar demand. Later, Nitish also criticised the Centre for sitting over our demands.        
	The central team members, who are expected to stay here till tomorrow, also met disaster management officials and other departments concerned in their bid to assess the demand and the quantum of the damage.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 2: Activists from women organisations, including We Can, All India Democratic Womens Association (Aidwa) and National Alliance of Women (Nawo), today voiced concern over the absence of sexual harassment cells in states government and private offices.        
	The members protested against the alleged reinstatement of a psychology professor of Utkal University syndicate. He was one of the three who were suspended in 2006 by the then university vice-chancellor L.N. Mishra after students brought forth sexual harassment charges against them. The rest of the two professors have retired and the third  Prabhash Mishra  was reinstated by the university syndicate recently.        
	We fail to understand the reason behind the decision, said Aidwa leader Tapasi Praharaj. Activists recently sought information under the Right to Information Act on why Mishra was reinstated. The reply was annoying, as they wrote back (syndicate) stating that they could not understand our question, said Praharaj.        
	Activists also approached Governor-cum-Chancellor M.C. Bhandare on April 10 and May 12 to press for action against the decision, but so far there has been no response from the governors office. Now, the members have threatened to demonstrate in the university campus if demands are not met.        
	Activists have also carried out a survey in offices  especially Orissa Mining Corporation and police commissionerate  to see if they had a harassment cell, said Pramila Swain of Nawo. None did.        
	But cases of harassment are being lodged.         
	An employee at the research and quality control unit of the water resources department recently brought sexual harassment charges against a senior officer, Birendra Kumar Sahu, at the Mahila police station

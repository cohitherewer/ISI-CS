The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 LOW ON FIZZ

 For the Union health minister, it is perhaps show time again. After having dimmed the aura of smoke-exhaling stars with his ban on cigarettes on screen last year, Mr Anbumani Ramadoss once more turns his guns on film personalities. They, together with cricketers, Mr Ramadoss recently insisted at an event in Calcutta, are to give up promoting soft drinks and fast food because ?these are doing much harm to society?. But, as before, the minister gets the wrong end of the stick. There can be no denying the connection between advertisements and the creation of desire. But merely hitting out at the faces that bring the products into the living room will hardly solve the problem. And India does have more than a slight problem with junk food consumption. As Mr Ramadoss guesses rightly, junk food is rapidly increasing the health costs for both the country?s population and its government, perhaps at a higher rate than that caused by smoking. There is already a sharp increase in heart ailments, diabetes and other complications related to obesity ? a price many Indians have to pay for their new-found prosperity.

 The problem is certainly not confined to India. The West has been battling it for a while. This should be apparent wherever globalization has changed food habits, increased the consumers? choices and deepened pockets. But the ills of excessive adipose are still not as evident here as, say, in the United States of America or even the United Kingdom. This is why children are indulgently allowed to forego their home-made ?tiffin? for a burger from the canteen, or to skip physical exercise for watching television. What conscientious ministers like Mr Ramadoss could do is promote greater awareness of the dangers that lurk behind such a lifestyle, and perhaps use the same faces that he is targeting to beam such messages into Indian homes. As Mr Ramadoss must have noted, given the runaway success of some government propaganda on social and health matters on the small screen, children as well as adults are obviously not immune to such persuasion. If the minister relents, he may even find this tactic more successful than imposing his iron will to force people to give up smoking or pleading with stars to stop luring children to yet another packet of potato chips. And so far as the vices of the middle class are concerned, it is also the safest bet for the government.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 THROUGH A DIFFERENT LENS

 Chair: Forbidden city, Beijing Mukerjee is currently on her second visit to China, on a state invitation, as part of an international delegation

 Mala Mukerjee entered professional photography quite by chance, although she has been taking photographs since she was a child with her fathers Leica. She did a diploma course at Londons Guildhall university, because she felt it was important to upgrade her knowledge of photo-printing techniques. Her works have been exhibited in London, Oxford, Mumbai, Calcutta, and various other cities. One question she faces in India is about the absence of people in her works. Indian viewers are yet to become familiar with the genre of abstract art, she feels. Her series on windows, which continues to receive additions, has beautifully draped glass-and-teak English windows as well as the bare, rust-and-decayed-wood windows of dilapidated Indian homes. Jantar Mantar is another favourite subject, to which Mukerjee loves to return. Excerpts from an interview with her.

 Q. Do women photographers bring a different sensibility to their work?

 A. Different persons look at things differently. To that extent any work that claims to be original must have the stamp of a distinct sensibility. It is the artists personality, background and mental make-up that matter more than sex. I do not ever approach my work thinking that I am a woman. I do not know of too many women photographers who do the kind of work that I do. Rather, I find a kindredness of spirit with the work of some photographers who happen to be men. I think I have been able to inspire a few photographers. Some of them are producing work with which I feel on similar wavelengths. There are men as well as women among them.

 This is not to say that photography does not have its own peculiar challenges. Some situations are better suited for young men with strong limbs than for women. Frankly, I cannot picture myself on a battlefront taking pictures of a war raging around me. Also, situations in which the action is taking place in a crowded area may need a photographer who can elbow his way in to be at the right spot or, say, can climb a wall if necessary.

 I am not saying that women cannot do that. Some women are competing successfully with men in this kind of photo-journalism. There are situations that can make it difficult for a woman to take interesting pictures. The answer, though, is no. I do not think my work is different because of my being a woman.

 Q. As a professional photographer, have you ever felt obstructed, or privileged, because of your gender? 

 A. No. People have generally been helpful to me men and women. There have been cases where I have been rebuffed, but my womanhood had nothing to do with that. I normally ask for consent before snapping a stranger. I would like to think people give their consent to me more readily than they would if a man were to approach them.

 Q. Do you feel Indian photographers are restricted in their choice of subjects and perspectives?

 A. Here again, ones mental-make up matters, not nationality. A photographer with a post modern approach will choose his subjects differently from, say, a conservative. A politically committed photographer will have his own point of view. Restrictions are self-imposed and also imposed by societal values upon which one is brought up. Some subjects are popular in the West but elicit little public interest here. The West has, by and large, a more liberal attitude. It is possible that Indian photographers are more conservative. But I will not generalize.

 I have faced more restrictions and prohibitions in India (photographing bridges, airports, important buildings) than I have elsewhere. I also believe that foreign photographers face much greater restrictions in India than we do. They have to take prior permission from the authorities, often located in Delhi, for some types of work.

 Q. Does wielding the camera make you feel powerful in any way?

 A. No. I prefer to take portraits when people are least aware of my presence with the camera. It helps if the photographer is able to develop an easy relationship with the subject. This is possible even with a stranger on the street after the exchange of a few sentences or gestures (a smile often does the trick). The subject must develop confidence in the photographer and be at ease. The power of a camera only distracts it makes people self-conscious and uneasy. That is not my idea of a good situation for portraits. It is also possible, in some situations, to get good results when the subject is not aware of the presence of a camera/photographer. Candid work often gives excellent portraits. Also there are situations when the subject knows about the cameras presence, but is so absorbed in his work that he pays no attention to it.

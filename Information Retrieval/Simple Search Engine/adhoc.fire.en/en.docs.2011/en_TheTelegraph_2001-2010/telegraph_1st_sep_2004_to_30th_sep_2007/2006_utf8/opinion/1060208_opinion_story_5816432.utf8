The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 OVER BOARD

 Religious fanaticism is the world?s oldest form of political correctness. The first victim of the latter is a sense of humour and the ability to laugh at oneself. This is at the heart of the protests against the caricatures of Prophet Mohammed that were published in a Danish newspaper. There is no doubt that the cartoons paid scant regard to Muslim sentiments by actually depicting Mohammed. But that is no reason for the incident to acquire the proportions that it has across west Asia and elsewhere. Fanatical Muslims must recognize the harm they are doing to their faith. A very powerful body of opinion in the West has begun a campaign since the attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, that intolerance and violence are integral to Islam. Muslims who are protesting against the cartoon by taking to violence and arson are only fortifying such a prejudiced view of Islam. This display of fanaticism is only serving to deflect attention from the tolerant and catholic strands of Islam. Perhaps because Islam is such a young religion ? young compared to the other established world religions like Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Christianity and so on ? that it is so unusually prickly and sensitive about what it perceives as attacks against its traditions and practices.

 The protesters must accept that embedded in every democratic and liberal society is not only the right to criticize but also the right to lampoon and ridicule. The exercise of this right may not always fulfil the highest standards of good taste but the existence of this right in a democracy is as important as the right to protest. The newspaper in Denmark has used this right in a manner that has offended sections of Muslims across the world. But this sense of outrage ? however justified ? cannot be taken as a licence for violence and the destruction of property. Ignoring ridicule is the best mode of killing it. Fanatical Muslims, by doing exactly the opposite, have only invited further ridicule, and perhaps even aroused greater opposition and hostility towards Islam.

 The Danish daily which has cast the first stone should also engage in some introspection. It has chosen to pander to one of the worst forms of prejudice that is on show in the Western world. This can only be compared to the racist slurs that were common before empire became a bad word in the West?s lexicon of political correctness. It is worth speculating if the same newspaper ? and those of its ilk ? would publish similar lampoons on, say, the blacks, gays or feminists. It would possibly not do so because it employs a self-censorship that is governed by codes of political correctness. Is it too much to expect that a similar restraint will be used against displaying items that might provoke a frenzy of religious fanaticism?

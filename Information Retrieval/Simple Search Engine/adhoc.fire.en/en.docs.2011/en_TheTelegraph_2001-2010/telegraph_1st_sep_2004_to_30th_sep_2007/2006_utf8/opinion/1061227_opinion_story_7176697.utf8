 GAMES PEOPLE PLAY

 Bad news for lovers of English: the Scrabble-playing community is about to get a new, up-to-date list of all the English words it can use. And an anti-English dogs breakfast that will be.

 For those who dont know, Scrabble is a word-game, played with lettered tiles on a special board. The players make words, incorporating one or more letters from previously made words. Each letter has a value: one point for easy letters such as E, five for K, ten for Q or Z, and your word scores accordingly.

 Great fun it is, as played in any normal household by players of roughly equal skills and knowledge of the language. The big question is: what words do you allow? The main troublemakers are the umpteen imports with no English equivalent. Kiwi, for example, is obviously OK. But what about those other New Zealand birds, the moa, kea or tui? Or what was originally Latin, as in ad hoc?

 In my home, like most, common sense and mutual concord are the first guides. In doubt, we refer to a 600-page dictionary, but exclude archaisms, dialect, slang or, notably, American spelling; and include familiar words such as fax, too new for the dictionary.

 In sum, our English belongs in the real world. Not so in high-level Scrabble. Its players rely on an official word list of (inflections included) some 220,000 words, and assiduously memorize as many as they can.

 The result is a grotesque hodge-podge of archaisms, foreignisms and, above all, obscurities unknown to 99 in 100 of even well-educated English-speakers. A few normal English words creep in, but almost, one feels, against the players will: they would sooner write janes than jeans. (Do you know what a jane is? I dont and my dictionary doesnt either.)

 Scrabberwocky

 Who ever used the verbs abye, condiddle, flyte or weet? What are fohs, fomes, fon or forbs? When did you last spot an abaca, an abamp or an abator ? Have you ever met dispread and its past tense disprad? Is your horse spaviet or liable to be wexed? Are you often scowthered?

 Two-letter words are especially useful for connecting one word with or running alongside another. So our top-level Scrabblers have an armoury of them: ch, an obsolete dialect word for I; ee, oo, oy and gu,Scots words for eye, we, grandchild and a kind of violin played in Shetland. Three-letter phoneys are useful too, so there is a small army of them.

 The new list will add even more: ja, fe, ki, za (no, dont ask) and no fewer than 66 of three letters, including such gems as igg, jal, aua (a mullet) and aue (an interjection, it seems, of pain).

 These words may, somewhere, exist. Others listed quite certainly dont. Almost any word ending in -ness is granted a plural. Do you believe in farwawaynesses or cursednesses? The talkers of Scrabberwocky do.

 Theyre not even consistent. They allow Scottish dialect, but little of others. Shakespeares unhouselled, Spensers kon (know) and even the ybounden of a 14th century carol are there. So why not Chaucers thousands of oddities?

 They rule out almost all the second person singular of verbs. It is indeed obsolete; but Lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace was sung every Sunday evening in every Anglican church for three centuries, and long into my lifetime. Not into the Scrabblers gibberish, however; they probably think it is the superlative of the well-known adjective lett, letter, lettest.

 If the grandees of Scrabble want to play in an artificial language, so be it. But dont pretend its English. I could go on for 220,000 words, but I wont. At such absurdnesses, Ch can but interject, Aue.

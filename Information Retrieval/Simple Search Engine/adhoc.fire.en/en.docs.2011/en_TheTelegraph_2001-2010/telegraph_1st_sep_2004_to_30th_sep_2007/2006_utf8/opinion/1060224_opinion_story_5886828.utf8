The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 ldquo;Drawing is the root of everything rdquo;: thus wrote Vincent Van Gogh (1853-1890), who, at the age of 27, declared his life rsquo;s pursuit the practice of art. Drawing wasn rsquo;t peripheral to Van Gogh rsquo;s creativity. He drew continuously, between paintings, for paintings, as an expedient and even when he was not allowed to paint under doctor rsquo;s orders. In technique, in style and in composition, his drawings are intimately intertwined with his paintings. In this book, VINCENT VAN GOGH: THE DRAWINGS by Colta Ives, Susan Alyson Stein, Sjraar Van Heugten and Marije Vellekoop (Yale, $45), for the first time, a detailed analysis is made of what Colta Ives calls Van Gogh rsquo;s ldquo;graphic fervour rdquo;. Left is the drawing entitled The Sower, the first version of what was to become the famous painting. To his brother Theo, Vincent wrote that the painted version lacked ldquo;clearness of touch rdquo;. He added that is one reason why he felt it necessary to draw it.

 Duel in Bengal

 - 13 lakh names deleted from the voters list; another 15 lakh to be dropped

 The Election Commission and the CPM are furiously crossing swords. But the commissions decision to stagger elections in West Bengal has presented the CPM with a political issue to champion at the hustings at a time when it was starved of issues, reports Debashis Bhattacharyya

 Debashis Sen had just returned from a short stint at the Washington-based International Monetary Fund last October when his boss gave him the news. Why me? gasped the 1985-batch, Bengal-cadre IAS officer. 

 Being the chief electoral officer (CEO) of the state ? as Sen, five months into the hot seat, has learnt ? is not easy. Certainly not when the countrys Election Commission (EC) and the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Bengals ruling party for close to three decades, are in a full-body, Sumo-esque lock. The wrangling between the two is fast reaching a crescendo as the proactive EC steps up pressure to ensure a free and fair election in the eastern state, long draped in red. 

 The feud shows little signs of being called off. The EC is convinced that it is on the right path. The Marxists are equally adamant that the EC has stepped out of line. And though some believe that the Left will eventually gain out of the imbroglio, the battle royale continues. 

 The EC, clearly, has hit where it hurts most. Some 13 lakh names have been deleted from the voters list in the operation clean roll being waged by the commission in Bengal. The CEO says the commission expects another 15 lakh names to be dropped from the list before the election to the 294-seat Assembly gets rolling. 

 Not surprisingly, the Opposition in Bengal ? which has long accused the ruling party of packing the electoral list with bogus voters ? is elated. We are happy that we stand vindicated, says Congress general secretary Manas Bhuinya. We have always complained of these fake voters, but for the first time the EC has taken a serious note of it, he says. 

 The CPM, on the other hand, is fuming. The party has accused the commission of deleting the names of genuine voters in many constituencies even though the EC maintains that only those who have died or moved away have been dropped from the list. But what has really raised the hackles of the Left Front, the ruling coalition led by the CPM, is the ECs decision to hold the poll in five phases, starting on April 17 and ending on May 8. Its unwarranted and unjustified, given the law and order situation in Bengal. Elections have always been peaceful here since we came to power, says veteran CPM leader and former chief minister Jyoti Basu. Party leaders question the motive for the move, arguing that even in strife-torn Kashmir, Assembly elections were held only in four phases. 

 The EC, however, sticks by this unprecedented decision. EC officials say the split polls are necessary for area domination ? a euphemism for a strong presence of central forces and observers in each constituency to ensure a free poll. The decision was taken keeping ground realities in mind, a central EC member says. We have to look at issues such as troubled areas and the number of security forces available for the polls.

 To be sure, the EC has taken a number of steps to prevent electoral frauds. For one, it has made it mandatory for voters to carry their photo identity cards issued by the commission. No EPIC (electors photo identity card), no vote, is the latest EC buzzword. The commission has also ordered a photo electoral roll (a list of voters with their photos) in 46 constituencies, where it has received a large number of complaints about fake voters. 

 The EC has cast its net far and wide, seeking to plug the gaping loopholes. Teachers, many of whom belong to the pro-CPM unions, have been barred from electoral duties. The EC rules that unlike in previous elections, no teachers can be appointed as presiding officers. 

 Paramilitary forces, too, will operate for the first time directly under the EC. Jawans from the central forces will keep an eye on the polling process in booths and intervene if there is a need. EC observers ? there will be 350 in all ? are criss-crossing the state, monitoring the poll arrangement, much to the chagrin of the ruling party. Casting the observers as partisan, the CPM has lodged several complaints against them with the commission. 

 The Election Commission is concerning itself with every aspect of poll management, including maintenance of law and order, which is a state subject, CEO Sen says. To show that it means business, the commission has already taken disciplinary action against 24 officials in the state. 

 But the big question is: are all these measures going to sound the death knell for the CPMs 29 years of uninterrupted rule in Bengal? Not everyone thinks so. In fact, some analysts believe that the EC, in its zeal to prevent the scientific rigging the Opposition has always ascribed CPM victories to, is going too far and that some of the steps it has taken may actually benefit the Marxists. 

 The EC appears to be overzealous and some of its measures like holding a five-phase poll in the state defy logic. An organised party like the CPM is only going to use it to its advantage, says Dwaipayan Bhattacharyya of the Calcutta-based Centre for Studies in Social Sciences. 

 Sure enough, the EC, while hemming in the ruling party with a fence of restrictions, has also presented the CPM with a potentially explosive political issue to champion at the hustings. And this could not have come at a more opportune time for the party, starved as it was of any real issues this poll. 

 What the EC has done is an insult to people of Bengal and it has become an emotive issue in this election, says Benoy Konar, veteran CPM leader and member of its state committee. People would respond to this injustice. 

 Jyoti Basu, too, says voters will give a fitting reply to the EC which, he stresses, seems unaware of ground realities in Bengal. In party rallies, leaders are also harping on the trouble caused to thousands of students as the five-phase poll threatens to disrupt examination schedules. 

 Analysts say the hypothesis that the CPM has been in power only through vote frauds is missing the wood for the trees. The Oppositions disunity is the Lefts main strength in Bengal. Despite several rounds of talks, Mamata Banerjees Trinamool Congress, for example, has not been able to finalise a seat-sharing arrangement with its ally, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Her call for a grand alliance of opposition parties also fell through with the Congress refusing to join in unless she snapped ties with the BJP. All this, needless to say, could only help the CPM prolong its stay in power. 

 The partys bulging organisational muscle is not to be winked at either. Anyone on the field knows how strong their organisation is vis-a-vis the opposition parties, says Bhattacharyya, who has studied the panchayat system extensively in rural Bengal. 

 This partly explains why opposition parties in Bengal are groaning more and more under the weight of the EC measures. Rahul Sinha, general secretary of the state BJP, says the commissions decision not to allow graffiti, posters and banners for campaign has hit the party hard. The Election Commission could have restricted the campaign, but this blanket ban has only helped the CPM. They are carrying out door-to-door campaigns and distributing leaflets, as allowed by the EC. But we simply do not have the organisational resources to do that, Sinha says. 

 The other opposition parties are hurting as well. Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay, senior Trinamool leader and the Opposition chief whip in the outgoing Assembly, claims that names of 1500 Trinamool voters have been deleted from the voters list in Rashbehari, the Calcutta constituency from where he is seeking re-election. Local election officials are refusing to put their names back on the list though they have shown their ration cards and bank passbooks. They say it is too late, Chattopadhyay moans. His campaign, he says, has also been constricted by the Commissions order against defacing walls. 

 Manas Bhuinya of the Congress says that the five-phase poll has affected the Opposition too. He says there is absolutely no time left to campaign before the first phase of the poll scheduled for April 17. Up to April 13, the use of loudspeakers is banned in the state because of the higher secondary examinations. That leaves us with barely two days to campaign, he says. On the other hand, Bhuinya says the five-phase poll would help the CPM as it can now easily move its cadres from one constituency to another at the end of each phase. 

 Not surprisingly, even though the CPM is struck with a double whammy ? the EC restrictions and a critically ill Anil Biswas, the partys state secretary ? it hardly seems perturbed. Politburo member Biman Bose, tasked with overseeing the poll campaign along with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in absence of Biswas, says though the party is not in favour of a split poll, it had no problems accepting it. 

 Meanwhile, Debashis Sen is putting in a 12-hour day without a day off, to ensure everything goes according to the book. Its not easy, with his office split in two places and the five-day poll heightening his problems five-fold. But the men he meets on his morning walks in Salt Lake keep him going. They recognise his face on television and stop him on his tracks. Carry on with your good work, they say, shaking his hand.

Bones of contention

 Polling in five phases 

 Who gains? The CPM. It can shift its cadre from polling area to polling 

area. The Opposition doesnt have the organisational muscle to do this. 

 Deletion of the names of a large number of voters from the electoral 

roll 

 Who gains? No one. All parties hit. 

 Ban on graffiti and posters 

 Who gains? The CPM. Its cadre is campaigning door to door. The Opposition 

parties dont have a cadre. 

 The large number of observers 

 Who gains? The Opposition. But the CPM is making this a campaign issue 

and accusing the observers of hobnobbing with Opposition leaders.

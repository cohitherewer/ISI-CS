 Letters to Editor

 Sleight of hand

 Sir Such disrespect and insult, as shown by the Australian captain, Ricky Ponting, to the president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India after the presentation ceremony of the Champions Trophy, should never be tolerated by the board (Push comes to shove, Nov 7). The International Cricket Council should carry out a thorough investigation to find out the real intention behind Ponting shoving Sharad Pawar out of the way. However, the Australian cricketers already have the disrepute of misconduct both on and off the field. Be it Greg Chappel pointing his middle finger towards the crowd or Shane Warnes intimacy with models in hotel rooms, the Aussies have established a reputation for annoying actions.

 Yours faithfully,

Rahul Roy, Calcutta

 Sir The way the Australian cricket team has misbehaved with the BCCI president is deplorable. The Australians were never known for their gentlemanly behaviour on the field. Pontings rude behaviour, following close on the heels of the controversy around the Australian umpire Darrell Hair, is contemptible. The BCCI should boycott playing matches with Australia or inviting them to India unless the Australian team apologizes for their misconduct. The ICC must also take disciplinary action instead of seeking half-hearted apologies.

 Yours faithfully,

Raghubir Singh, Pune

 Sir Cricket is said to be a gentlemens game, but the Australian teams behaviour after receiving the Champions Trophy from the BCCI president was totally unacceptable and anything but gentlemanly. Though Sharad Pawar has declared magnanimously that the incident was trivial, the utter lack of respect shown to the board president by the Australians goes on to prove the singular lack of grace in their behaviour. They should not be invited to play in India, nor should the Indian team play in Australia till the visitors apologize for their misconduct. The Australians seemed to have forgotten that they are the unofficial ambassadors of their country, to which they have brought shame.

 Yours faithfully,

C.V.K. Moorthy, Bengaluru

 Sir Sharad Pawar was gracious enough to pardon Ponting for gesturing with his finger to hand over the trophy. This was followed by a push and shove to get him out of the view of the photographers. There may be one unintentional mistake, but not three in a row. It was rude and audacious behaviour, especially, since the seniority of the presenter was evident. It was clearly a breach of etiquette, and an instance of disrespect shown not only to the BCCI president but also to a cabinet minister. This is a national insult and deserves severe penalty. A national team cannot afford to forget simple rules of conduct even in a jubilant mood. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sense and sensibilities

 Sir In Against common sense (Nov 2), Mukul Kesavan goes on to show how a male-dominated society has an uncanny knack of directing its spleen during times of crises, national or social, at women. Be it a drunkard husband, the liberal Jack Straw or the narrow-minded imam, Taj Din al-hilali, the ultimate aim of male chauvinists is to turn women into scapegoats. If women dress liberally they are blamed for displaying uncovered meat. Whereas, if they decide to cover themselves, with a veil for instance, they are considered primitive and non-progressive. Sadly, most people tend to forget that there are more important problems to deal with than ways of dressing up.

 Yours faithfully,

Md. Aslam Parvez, Calcutta

 Sir It is not the ongoing debate on the burqa that should worry us as much as the frequent threats of violence by Muslims angered by perceived insults, be it from Pope Benedict XVI, the director of a Mozart opera in Berlin or an Australian imam. In the late Eighties, the photographer Andres Serrano exhibited a photograph entitled Piss Christ, depicting a crucifix immersed in urine. It raised a furore and the US senate took the unusual step of condemning the photographer, but nobody was harmed in the process. Contrast this with the more recent incident of the cartoon of Prophet Muhammed. There were weeks of rioting, resulting in loss of lives. Muslims, especially those who have opted to live in democracies, must realize that the constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech cannot be held hostage to religious perceptions, some of which are of dubious validity.

 Yours faithfully,

 Kangayam R. Rangaswamy,Waunakee US

 Erratum

 Sir I would like to point out a typographical error in the article, A fractured conscience (Nov 7). The paragraph beginning In August 2000.. includes the sentence Revolutionaries are not very exercised at the annihilation of workers of either Muslim or Hindu variety. As I had framed it, it should have read, Revolutionaries are not very exercised at the annihilation of workers by jihadis of either Muslim or Hindu variety. I think you will agree that the error makes a significant difference to my meaning.

 Yours faithfully,

Dilip Simeon, New Delhi 

 The error is regretted.

 TIME ON A GADGET

 But even timekeepers are subject to the ravages of time. Reports suggest that among the young the popularity of the wristwatch as an essential accessory is on a sharp decline. The young of today do not need a wristwatch any more since their mobile phones and their iPods tell them the time with as much efficiency and as little fuss as the wristwatch. These gadgets perhaps tell the time more accurately because these are electronic. But the decline in the popularity of the wristwatch is not necessarily a function of its relative absence of accuracy. It has lost its relevance for the young as a fashion statement. The youth are choosing gadgets that also work as a timekeeper. A wristwatch, on the other hand, is only a timekeeper. This trend suggests that it is the lower end of the wristwatch market that is being adversely affected. The higher end, dominated by watchmakers like Patek Philippe or Vacheron Constantin, has not felt the impact as yet.

 It is entirely possible that the wristwatch, like the pocket watch of yesteryear, will only survive in a niche market, and will be used by fuddy-duddies and antiquarians. This will be a radical shift in the keeping and the reading of time. The latter idea is important since, even a few years ago, a child had to be taught how to read the time, and the working of the three hands of the watch had to be carefully explained. This need has now disappeared. Electronic gadgets do not have hands to tell the time: they just display it. Just as the advent of the calculator eliminated the teaching of elementary arithmetic and mental mathematics, just as the invention of velcro did away with the intricacy of tying shoe laces, so the popularity of electronic gadgets is bidding adieu to a particular way of telling and recording time. O tempora, o mores. Time is being conquered by time.

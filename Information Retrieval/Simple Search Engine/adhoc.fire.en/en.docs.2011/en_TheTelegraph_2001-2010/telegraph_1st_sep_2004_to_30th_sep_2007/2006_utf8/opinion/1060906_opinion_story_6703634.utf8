 HARSH CHOICE

 Looked at perversely, Ms Sonali Das, who killed her newborn daughter with her mothers help in a small town of West Bengal, was exercising a choice. Mother of a retarded four-year-old girl, she would only accept a male child as her second issue. A similar preference is expressed by innumerable others who go for sex determination tests, often during their first pregnancy, and escape prying neighbours by killing female foetuses in silence. But even in her tragic hamhandedness, Ms Das is not alone. Mothers have shown no remorse in throwing out their just-born daughters from hospital windows or leaving them on the wayside as dogfeed. Meanwhile, rural India continues to practise its tried and tested methods of suffocating the child in case she sees the light of day. The collective effort of the woman (often as misguided or helpless as Ms Das), her family and sometimes her community has succeeded in dangerously reducing Indias female sex ratio. In Ms Dass case, as in a majority of others, the preference may have been dictated by the financial condition of the family, which sees the girl child as a veritable burden given the amount it takes to marry her off. But as reports and studies increasingly indicate, the choice is not determined by such simple calculations. Had it been so, urban India, basking in its newfound prosperity and so wildly receptive of new values and ideas, would not have reported such a high percentage of female foeticide. According to a recent study, a single decade has seen a complete change in the sex ratio in the most prosperous places of Calcutta itself. And in cities beyond, the figures shame those in the hinterlands. Occupants of urban India, it goes without saying, are exercising their choice, and more stridently than Ms Das. Expensive, cutting-edge technology ensures that their choice is carried through, often in the case of the first-born, and certainly in the case of the second. Unlike Ms Das, they do not wait for a third chance.

 The preference for a male child is, to a large extent, culturally determined in India and the rest of the subcontinent. This has its historical baggage (the actual experience of social repression, malnourishment and contempt), which is proving to be an insurmountable burden for a rapidly globalizing India. A way out of this could be provided by a more targeted drive for education and welfare for women, and greater institutionalized care for the girl child.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 TO BE OR NOT 

 A second wedding anniversary is traditionally associated with paper. Mr Manmohan Singh might well want to link the second anniversary of his government with something even more fragile than paper. The completion of the second year of the government of the United Progressive Alliance coincided with mayhem in the stock market, with the widespread protests against the policy of numerical quotas for other backward classes, with the resignation of two eminent social scientists from the Knowledge Commission formed by the prime minister, and an escalation of violence in Jammu and Kashmir. The combined impact of all this cannot exactly be read as a vote of confidence for the UPA and for Mr Singh. The visible lack of confidence is, to a large extent, a fallout of Mr Singh?s palpable failure to be an effective leader. He has conveyed the impression that he is not the master of the decision-making process. This has given rise to the widespread belief that the real power vests with the Congress president, Ms Sonia Gandhi, who refuses to assume the responsibilities that go with wielding power. Mr Singh presents the pathetic and all-too-familiar figure of a good man fallen among politicians.

 That this divergence between power and its responsibilities has not reflected adversely on the stability of the regime is related to the performance of the economy. The UPA has not been the pace-setter of economic reforms, but its macroeconomic management has been commendable. The good health certificate that the economy has received from all quarters has helped in deflecting attention from failures and scandals. For the latter, witness the Volcker report and Mr Natwar Singh?s much-delayed resignation. For political failures, see the management of affairs in Bihar. Both cast shadows on the prime minister?s extraordinary record of integrity. The challenge of the third year will, however, come from domestic issues. It will grow directly from policy measures that have recently been put in place. The prime minister has succumbed meekly to the policy of reservations in educational institutions launched by Mr Arjun Singh, the minister for human resource development. Mr Manmohan Singh has thus implicated himself in a populist gesture aimed at creating caste-based vote-banks. History will not be kind to him for this divisive act.

 FOLLY IN HIGH PLACES

 MALA FIDE - Malvika Singh

 Two erudite men, both former ministers of external affairs, both authors, both from Rajasthan, albeit from different communities Natwar Singh and Jaswant Singh have hogged the headlines these last two weeks for all the wrong reasons. It was embarrassing to listen to these men as they got increasingly muddled in their own rhetoric. They have become symbols of irresponsibility in high places, betraying traditional good sense and appropriate conduct.

 Because they are intrinsically intelligent, but alas, madly ambitious, they manage to correct their wrong moves as they stumble along, hoping the populace will forget their inanities. Television has pandered to this and has given expensive prime time to irrelevant posturing. The majority reaction, apart from the press, has been one of pity pity for those who have lost their cool.

 Rumour has it that there was a suggestion within the BJP to make a younger and more dynamic person leader of the opposition in the Rajya Sabha and retire Jaswant Singh from that position. With this rather irrelevant controversy around him, the plan may have got scuttled for the moment, leaving more time to lobby. A cover story in a leading national newsmagazine put Jaswant Singh back on the national arena from where he had disappeared. This has been an inventive marketing strategy for his book, the publishers of which are delighted that they did not have to spend a nickel for the national advertisement, or review, of the book, thanks to the enthusiastic men and women who break news.

 Word of mouth

 They, in fact, have broken no news at all. We do not know if there was a mole and if so, who it was. All that has been exposed is infantile behaviour. As bits and pieces are trotted out and repeated endlessly, the one thing that is never addressed is the faulty judgment that provoked the then government of India to send its cabinet minister on the aircraft, virtually as the host returning terrorists to their safe haven. If only the same dignity could be meted out to Indians in India by these same men and women who rule us, the rampant dissatisfaction that has triggered militant protest movements on our own soil, against our own people would not have been so rampant. These well-read, well-heeled, well travelled but failed leaders are detrimental to the future of India. We need new ideas, radical policies that cleanse the past and present rot, hard disciplined work and commitment from the elected representatives, and not this posturing for petty personal ends.

 As for the Natwar Singh saga had he kept quiet, not volunteered the many sweet nothings, it would have been a forgotten story. He was not serving the government when he sent the letters of recommendation. Business deals were done and if government agencies are owed monies or have to extract penalties et al, so be it. Punish the deviants. Let us not be bombarded with non-issues. Boring. How come we never seem to get the real dope on the real scandals?

 Stories of corruption in high places, indulged in by VVIPs are discussed ad nauseam everywhere from humble tea stalls to fancy living rooms in cities as well as in the sprawling lawns of Lutyens Delhi, where that reserved community spills the beans on one another. That is how incestuous corruption is, and therefore easy to track, but it remains protected, by and large, by the same privileged community. Why do we not have some vigorous investigative journalism? Is it because we are addicted to handouts?

 And finally, to return to the two Singhs, surely their parties can intervene and ask them to cease the natak and get down to work or retirement, as the case may be. Enough of all the petty politics that we have been witness to in recent years.

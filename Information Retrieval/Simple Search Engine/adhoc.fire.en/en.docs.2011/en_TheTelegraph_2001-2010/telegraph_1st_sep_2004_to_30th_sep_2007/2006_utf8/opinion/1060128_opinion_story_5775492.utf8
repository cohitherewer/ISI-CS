 GUNS N ROSES

 Daya Nayak was once seen with the citys movers and shakers. But with the Anti-Corruption Bureau having moved for his arrest, the encounter specialist has fallen from grace 

Mumbais most infamous cop, Daya Nayak, nurtured a secret dream which he shared with some journalists once. I want to work in a film with my idol, Amitabh Bachchan, he said. 

 At one point of time ? when he was among the most f?ted policemen in the city ? it didnt quite seem like an impossible dream. But last week, his hopes were shattered as the Anti-Corruption Bureau accused him of graft and moved for his arrest after a prominent city paper exposed the story of his riches. The Mumbai police sub-inspector has since been suspended from the force. 

 Though the Mumbai police has its share of bad apples, Dayanand Nayak stands out for his remarkable rise in the force. The man who started out as a dish washer in an Udipi restaurant in Mumbai became one of the best-known encounter specialists in the city. In police lingo, an encounter specialist is the most dreaded cop in the force ? for he does not hesitate to kill. 

 Daya Nayak had 80 killings to his credit. And for a while, the city, caught in the maelstrom of crime and corruption, even seemed to welcome his actions. He was at the centre of debate, the subject of a film and seen with the citys movers and shakers. 

 So nobody was really surprised in 2002 when he flew Amitabh Bachchan in a private plane to his sleepy little hamlet, Yennehol near Mangalore in Karnataka, to inaugurate a school he had funded and named after his mother, Radha Nayak. There was a media outcry questioning his source of income for the multi-crore school, but the presence of Bachchan put a lid on the controversy. Bachchan had always stood up for Nayak and had been quoted as saying: I am willing to face any inquiry on Daya Nayak. 

 In turn, Nayak was a die-hard Bachchan fan. He once told a reporter that like Bachchan in the film Coolie, he too considered 786 a lucky number and wanted it to figure in his mobile phone number. To get the number allotted to him he had to lobby hard with the mobile service provider which was in the process of allocating it to a politician. Daya eventually managed to beat the politician to get the number. And it was quite an impressive one: 9820000786. 

 Nayak believed that the number worked wonders for him. When the school controversy broke out and the state government instituted an inquiry, Nayaks then boss, joint commissioner of police, crime, Bhujangrao Mohite, exonerated him of charges of illegal funding and extortion. Later, Chhagan Bhujbal, the then deputy chief minister of Maharashtra, gave him a clean chit in the state Assembly. 

 Nayak got the upper hand ? and he came out smelling like roses ? on two other occasions when he was accused of forging a nexus with Mumbais mafia and of accumulating assets disproportionate to his income. Nayak, in fact, has a history of getting out of uncomfortable situations. In 1999, mafia don Chhota Shakeels associate, Tariq Nabi, had filed a complaint of extortion against Daya Nayak and other officers. The state CID had discharged all the other accused but chargesheeted Nayak. But somehow the case never moved. 

 Nayak has also faced several human rights and inter-departmental inquiries on encounters, including that of an alleged Nigerian drug peddler, Abdul Halim, in the tony Mumbai suburb of Juhu. The Nigerian consulate lodged a protest with the city police and even closed the consulate for a day in 1997. 

 For many years it was believed that nobody who encountered Nayaks gun lived to tell the tale. Then one man went and proved the adage wrong. In December 2002, Mahesh Gowda was picked up by Daya Nayak. According to Gowdas statement in court, a local BJP leader who was a Nayak crony wanted Gowda finished off for personal reasons. When I asked Daya Nayak about my crime and the reason for getting beaten up, he laughed and said ? Marne ke liye gunha karne ki jaroorat nahin (you dont have to commit a sin to die), Gowda wrote in his complaint. 

 For two days and three nights Gowda was beaten black and blue. On the third night, the cops got me out of the lock up and asked me to sit in the police van. I had heard about these encounter killings and knew that once I sat in the van I was a dead duck. I dont know where I got the strength from but I just refused to budge. 

 What saved Gowda was Kannada. Nayak got a call and started speaking in Kannada, his mother tongue. I took the cue and pleaded with him in Kannada to let me go. It worked. He told me to go back to my native place and never to show my face in Bombay again, says Gowda. Ironically, Gowda later read in a newspaper that his cellmate, Munna Bapu, was allegedly killed in an encounter by Nayak on the same day. Gowda went back to his hometown in Shravanbelagola in Karnataka. 

 Then one day Gowda heard of a complaint lodged at the MCOCA court against Nayak by a journalist, Ketan Tirodkar. Gowda returned to Mumbai to seek justice and get his wife back who, he alleges, was forcibly married off to a local BJP leader, Suresh Gupta. In 2004, Gowda just walked into the court and pleaded with judge A.P. Bhangale to be made a witness against Nayak. 

 Gowdas testimony considered evidence might put Daya Nayak in the dock. But knowing the policemans penchant for getting out of sticky spots, he may well survive.

 Whats clear, though, is the fact that Daya Nayak is not likely to act in a film with Bachchan for a long, long time. And it remains to be seen if the actor would, as he once promised, stand by him in court.

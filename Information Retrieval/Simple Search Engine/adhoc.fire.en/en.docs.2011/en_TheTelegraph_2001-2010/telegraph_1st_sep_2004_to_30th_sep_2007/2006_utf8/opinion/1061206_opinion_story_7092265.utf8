 DIFFICULT DAYS AHEAD

 Rita Manchanda

 In the tumultuous days of the April Revolution in Nepal, the symbolic assertion of peoples power was the hoisting of flags on the defaced statue of Prithvi Narayan Shah, the founder of the Shah dynasty. Flying highest was the janajati or indigenous nationalities flag. Unlike the jana andolan of 1990, which was essentially Kathmandu-centric, this time, there was a country-wide mobilization and convergence on Kathmandu, and the janajatis came in huge numbers since the kings autocratic rule had affected their livelihood. 

 Today, the dominant graffiti in Kathmandu is all about ethnic assertion, particularly the Madhesia communitys right to self-determination. Madhesia and Dalit community leaders demand that their rights be reflected in the restructuring of the state. The consequences are manifest in new assertions the Chepang community wants self determination with autonomy in 29 village administrative units spread over four districts. The Maoist central leader and head of the Madhesh republican government, Matrika Yadav, warns that if the madhesi people did not get citizenship before the elections to the constituent assembly, they would boycott the polls. 

 Although upper caste columnists decry the populist manipulation of identity politics and blame the Maoists for promoting divisive ethnic federalism, ethnic rights activists argue that the onset of genuine autonomy prevents separatism. As for the Maoists, Prachanda, the rebel leader, states defensively that ethnic struggle is also a form of class struggle, and that self-determination is being advocated within a federal structure on the basis of not only ethnicity but also regionalism. 

 Future imperfect

 According to Krishna Khanal, a 

 political scientist, one of the crucial goals of the peoples 

 uprising was to restructure the Kathmandu-centric administrative 

 system, which provided no opportunity for those living 

 outside [the] capital. Social scientist, Mahendra Lawoti, 

 called it a system of institutionalized exclusion of more 

 than 80 per cent of the population to privilege the Bahun 

 Chetri upper castes.

 The challenge for the new inclusive 

 Nepal is to accommodate the aspirations of the officially 

 recorded 21 caste groups, 59 indigenous nationalities and 

 93 linguistic groups. In particular, there is the Madhesia 

 question and the demand for autonomy of the madhya 

 region abutting Bihar. This is a regional community group 

 of Hindus, Dalits, indigenous nationalities and Muslims, 

 discriminated by region and the singling out of the people 

 of Indian Mithila origin as migrants. Politics 

 is transforming this regional identity into an ethnic one. 

 The tussle between the hills (parbatiya) and the plains 

 (terai) is evinced in the denial of citizenship to more 

 than 300,000 madhesi. The Citizenship Bill goes some way 

 to meet this grievance despite its cut off date of April 

 1990 and its discriminatory provisions, which affect madhesi 

 women seeking husbands abroad.

 The restructuring of the state remains a contentious issue. The Comprehensive Peace Treaty makes no mention of federalism, though it mentions ending the present centralized and unitary structure of state and the need to address the problems of the oppressed . But doubts have been raised regarding the adoption of the mixed system of elections for the constituent assembly, which determines 50 per cent seats by proportional representation. Sarita Giri of the Sadbhavna Party is sceptical of parties demonstrating the political will to transform the dominant patron-client culture. 

 Political analysts warn that the failure to respond to the mobilized social consciousness of the oppressed could mean a new axis of conflict that would displace or redefine the old struggle between the forces of the monarchy and those of the democratic republicans.

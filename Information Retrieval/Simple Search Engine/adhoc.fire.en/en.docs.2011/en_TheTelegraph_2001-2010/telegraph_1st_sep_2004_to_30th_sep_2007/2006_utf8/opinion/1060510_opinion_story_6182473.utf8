 Difficult times

 Sir ? Pramod Mahajan?s death is a loss to the nation (?Brother?s hate wins?, May 4). But it is a much greater loss to the Bharatiya Janata Party. Although the BJP has many ?GenNext? leaders, they are not of the same calibre as Mahajan. The dead saffronite was a good orator, despite the fact that he did not always adhere to the civil use of language. His greatest achievement was the BJP?s victory in the closely fought 2003 assembly elections, particularly in Rajasthan. Thanks to Mahajan?s campaign management skills, the BJP turned the tide in its favour. But historical forces often defeat the greatest of strategists and Mahajan?s brashness and myopia cost the party the 2004 general elections. Nevertheless, what was admirable was Mahajan?s candid acceptance of responsibility for the defeat. His strength of character endeared him to his colleagues. With Mahajan?s death, the BJP has lost a member who could defend the party line against the dictates of the sangh parivar.

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

 Sir ? Politicians cutting across party lines have condoled the death of Pramod Mahajan. In an era of dynastic politics, this able legislator, who had had humble beginnings, made himself count not only within the BJP but also in national politics. His accidental and untimely death evokes memories of Rajiv Gandhi?s assassination. The Union government, setting aside bitter domestic politics, should issue a commemorative stamp in Mahajan?s honour.

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba

 Sir ? In contrast to the uncivil face of Indian politics, the ever-smiling Mahajan was a welcome relief. His death at the hands of his own brother has brought the domestic space of powerful celebrities under scrutiny. Nothing justifies Praveen Mahajan?s action, but the younger sibling may have had reasons to feel peeved. The larger lesson from the episode perhaps has to do with the changing equations within the family once a member rises to fame. 

 Yours faithfully,

M. Kumar, New Delhi

 Sir ? It is unfortunate that India had to lose another dynamic politician at a relatively young age. Commoners as well as celebrities have testified to the benevolence of this man. But one will never really know whether Mahajan practised charity at home. Although it is difficult to establish the truth about Praveen Mahajan?s charges against his slain brother, there is a lesson to learn from the deplorable incident. We ought to remember that before setting out to help the world outside, we should, first of all, set our own house in order. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shirleen A.B., Meghalaya

 Sir ? Pramod Mahajan?s name has been added to the ever-growing list of talented Indian politicians dying prematurely and under abnormal circumstances. At the beginning, there is Deendayal Upadhyay, a founder of the Jan Sangh, who was found dead in a train compartment in 1968. Sanjay Gandhi was killed in an air crash and Rajiv Gandhi was brutally assassinated. Promising politicians like Madhavrao Scindia and Rajesh Pilot died in accidents. One wonders what all these deaths will cost India in the long run.

 Yours faithfully,

Raghvendra Singh, Vadodara

 Sir ? Unlike most of his colleagues, Pramod Mahajan had had the grace and courage to take the blame on himself for the BJP?s electoral defeat in the general elections of 2004. But he gave full credit to the party workers and his fellow members whenever the BJP won through his efforts. As the saying goes, the hallmark of a great leader is his ability to take a little less of the credit and a little more of the blame that is his due. Despite the taint of communalism dogging the BJP, Mahajan enjoyed a good rapport with individuals across the political divide. Besides, he was in many ways responsible for India?s coming of age in the field of information technology. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? The untimely death of Pramod Mahajan is a setback for the BJP, which wished to use his political acumen to revive its lost fortunes. It was a queer mix of frustration and stigma which provoked Praveen Mahajan to convert his private hell into a public spectacle. However, it was the absence of adequate security at Pramod?s residence that allowed the younger sibling to fulfil his dark desires.

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

 Sir ? Had it not been a case of fratricide, the death of Pramod Mahajan would not have been subjected to such media hype.

 Yours faithfully,

Nandini Saraf, Calcutta

 Sir ? Politicians of all hues attended Pramod Mahajan?s funeral. The Congress even sent an official delegation headed by Motilal Vohra. In this context, the silence of the left has breached all bounds of civility. Surely, it would not have been an ideological compromise on the part of the Left Front to send a representative to attend the funeral. 

 Yours faithfully,

A. Choudhury, Calcutta

 Talk global, do local

 Sir ? If Bangalore can be rechristened Bengaluru to give it a local flavour, why can?t the Indian Institute of Management Bangalore be confined within India? Or so the government probably thinks. Institutes such as the IIMs are supposed to foster a global mindset in their students, who are trained to prepare Indian business and industry for the emerging global competitition. But try to reach out to even a small country like Singapore, and their attempt is immediately foiled. So much for our policy of liberalization!

 Yours faithfully,

Kangayam R. Rangaswamy, Waunakee, US

 Lights out

 Sir ? Drinking alcohol was taboo during my childhood. It was forty years ago, and society looked down upon a drinker as some kind of a villain. But over the years, things have changed to the extent that a teetotaller is treated as an old-fashioned person. Both smoking and drinking in India, as we see it now, are legacies of the West. We revel in aping the West so much that we do not stop to judge what is right and what is not. One of the greatest ever Indian actors, Ashok Kumar, was hardly ever seen in his films without a fag between his lips. Neither the public nor the press made a hue and cry about it. Surely, this was not because smoking was considered a healthy practice then! It was simply that the West approved of smoking at the time. If the greatest Indian icon of all times, Amitabh Bachchan, is made to apologize to the National Organization for Tobacco Eradication for appearing in a film with a cigar between his lips, it is because the anti-smoking lobby has grown very strong in the West. 

 When the West starts telling us that alcohol is bad, several organizations will come up in this country to secure a ban on it, and all drinkers will be castigated. Even our government follows the West in its policy-making. Have we forgotten to judge what is good for us?

 Yours faithfully,

S. Padmanabhan, Bilaspur

 Sir ? ?Bachchan says sorry for cigar pose? (Jan 11) is a lot of hullabaloo over nothing. For centuries, tobacco in a variety of forms has been used by mankind, sometimes to be chastised, sometimes to be glorified. The campaign drummed up by Note, though entirely noteworthy, does appear to be aimed at targeting a superhero like Bachchan (rather than the cigar that he is seen smoking) to get some quick publicity. There have been several occasions in the past when controversies have been instrumental in making films successful, taking the wind out of the complainant?s sail. Will the latest controversy tread the same route?

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Away from home

 Sir ? The decision by Infosys to implement its expansion plans in other states sounds the death knell for the software industry in Karnataka. The decision was perhaps long overdue. Karnataka had got a headstart in the IT race and continued to grow rapidly for several years. But the pathetic quality of infrastructure, government apathy and political interference have led to the sad state of affairs. In sharp contrast, other states have upgraded their infrastructure, and wooed IT industries. 

 Yours faithfully,

C.N. Kumar, Bangalore

 Sir ? H.D. Deve Gowda has reacted to ?Infosys to grow outside home? (Jan 12) by questioning what companies like Infosys have done for the state. He should think before making comments like these. What he has he done for his state? Or is it that he did not get as many favours from Infosys as he would have liked? No one can deny that Bangalore owes its global recognition to IT companies like Infosys and not to politicians like Deve Gowda. 

 Yours faithfully,

K.K. Poddar, Rourkela

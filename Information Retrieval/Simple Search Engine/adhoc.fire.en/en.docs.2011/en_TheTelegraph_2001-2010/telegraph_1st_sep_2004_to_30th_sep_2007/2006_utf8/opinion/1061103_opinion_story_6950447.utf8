The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 NEW HIGHS

 The Sensexs ride to 13000 from the depths it plumbed in early June has been swift, with the index climbing 45 per cent in less than five months. The market is already up 38 per cent this year, compared to a gain of 42 per cent for 2005. Inflows from foreign institutional investments are back, oil prices have fallen and the quarterly corporate results have been excellent. Yet the Sensexs climb to new highs has left many investors disappointed. That is because the broader market has not rallied and the Bombay Stock Exchange midcap and smallcap indices are far from their previous highs. Even within the Sensex, many companies are well below their May peaks. The current rally has been led by banking, telecom and information technology stocks, with the other sectoral indices left behind. The up- shot has been that many portfolios have not benefited. Small investors, in particular, who prefer midcap stocks, have not really been big gainers in this rally. 

 Nevertheless, the September quarter corporate results of smaller companies indicate that, in the aggregate, their profit growth has been much higher, in percentage terms, than that of larger companies. That raises the hope that the next stage of the rally will be in the better midcap stocks, as their valuations catch up with those of the frontline scrips. The other big worry of investors, including institutional investors, is that the Indian market is too expensive. The BSE 100 index is trading at a trailing price-earnings ratio of more than 20. At the same time, however, earnings growth in the last quarter has been around 28 per cent (it would be even higher if banks and the oil companies are included). In other words, the high growth in earnings justifies, to a large extent, the elevated valuations of Indian stocks. The bulls also point to the fact that although Indian PE ratios may be high, they are still way below the peaks reached during earlier bull runs. 

 Much depends, of course, on the prospects for growth in the economy. With investment demand kicking in and credit growing at a sizzling pace, there seem to be few worries on that score at present. In fact, the Reserve Bank of India too has raised its gross domestic product growth forecast in its recent mid-term review. Moreover, in the event of the expected slowdown in global growth, India is one of the few countries that will remain relatively insulated, thanks to its dependence on internal demand. In short, the current market rally has been based on solid fundamentals a rapidly growing economy and a very high rate of growth of corporate earnings.

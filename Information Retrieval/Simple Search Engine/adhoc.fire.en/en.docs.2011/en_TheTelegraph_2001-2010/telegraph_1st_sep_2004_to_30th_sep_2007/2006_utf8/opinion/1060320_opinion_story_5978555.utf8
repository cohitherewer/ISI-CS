 Letters to Editor

 Against the wall

 Sir ? It seems from his article, ?Cleaning up democracy? (March 16), that Partha Chatterjee is not entirely in favour of an impartial Election Commission in West Bengal. Even while admitting that the lack of such an institution in the United States of America might have caused widespread irregularities in the last two presidential elections, he does not consider it desirable that a body with such powers should conduct elections in Bengal. Chatterjee himself points to the opportunities for voter impersonation in the absence of error-free voters? lists, yet he cannot bring himself to support the efforts of the EC to ensure that some proof of citizenship be provided for inclusion of new voters in the list. One would like to ask him how new voters are enlisted in Britain where they have, according to him, ?an established tradition of non-partisan civil service?. Since Chatterjee also does not like the idea of extra policemen to ensure undisturbed polling, maybe this should be left to the local committee volunteers, as before. 

 The ban on election graffiti has disturbed the author no end. He feels that it is the ?single most visible material sign of political activity in the state?. How about the rallies and processions every other day and the bandhs? And the traffic snarls, loss of wages and general misery of the people? True, wall-writing has, like giant-sized cut-outs in Tamil politics, become essential aspects of Bengal?s political culture. But whoever thought cut-outs of political leaders in Tamil Nadu were of great aesthetic value?

 Chatterjee suggests that ?the EC should have insisted that the permission of the owner [of a building] be secured before a wall was used for a poster or graffiti?. Now this is a good laugh. Where walls are occupied in the words, ?all walls for XYZ party from 2005 to 2020?, I would like to meet someone who will deny party dadas the right to deface his walls, unless he has already decided to leave the locality for good. What, if I may ask Chatterjee, is wrong with the wish of cleansing the public political arena? Is the desire to rid ?the citizenship of all the noise, smell and gaudiness of a publicly mobilized plebeian [lumpen?] culture? a violation of Indian democracy? Why shouldn?t the act of voting be the private act of private citizens? The struggle of the weak cannot be won by wall-writing because the party which can mobilize more muscle and money will emerge victorious. The weak do not inherit the earth, at least not yet, walls or no walls.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Partha Chatterjee has disappointed this time. He criticizes the EC principally for two steps it has taken. One relates to the phasing of the polling process in West Bengal. It has been argued that the law-and-order situation in the state is not so bad as to warrant such strict supervision. Surely the author is not unaware of the history of electoral violence in the state? His statement that ?there has not been any major violence on election day in the state in many years? may gladden the die-hard left, but will convince few others. Violence may occur not only on election day, but before and after the polls too; and physical assault is not the only form of violence; there are others which do not get recorded. 

 ?Behind all this zeal? of the EC, Chatterjee detects a sinister conspiracy of the elite to destroy ?a publicly mobilized plebeian culture?. This is not convincing. The plebeian of this country have always been mobilized for electoral purpose. They deserve a better deal. The ?zeal? shown by the EC will not hurt them. It may hurt another section of the elite, namely the political class.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Thousands of genuine voters in villages in Bihar could exercise voting rights for the first time in the 55 years of the Indian republic only because the EC took some effective steps. Names of 13 lakh bogus voters have already been deleted and more such names are in the process of being deleted in West Bengal. This has happened only because of the ?activism? of the EC. It is unfortunate that Partha Chatterjee finds the graffiti and larger-than-life cut-outs used in election propaganda a part of our culture. By the same logic, intimidation of voters, false voting and booth capturing are also part of our culture, and any action by the EC against these practices should be against our democratic system. Perhaps Chatterjee should devote his next article to this.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? It is not appropriate to justify wall-writing in Bengal by pointing out that cut-outs are the norm in election campaigns in Tamil Nadu. Both are equally wrong. They encroach upon private property, and the over-zealous cadre, who paint party slogans on the walls, never bother to clean them up after the elections. If Partha Chatterjee has so much faith on the presence of electoral officers of political parties in polling booths, then how does he explain the numerous instances of booth capturing, rigging, fraudulent voters and violence that have marked all the elections in Bengal?s recent history.

 I have a feeling that Chatterjee?s real objection to the clean-up acts of the EC is his belief that elections in India are increasingly taking a bourgeois form. But it is doubtful how far posters, slogans and wall-writing are effective in bringing issues that concern the downtrodden to the table. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Partha Chatterjee?s political sympathies seem to have come in the way of his scholarship. It would perhaps do him good if he takes a walk around the state and does a reality check for himself. And why the discomfort with the deployment of more armed forces in polling booths? Does it worry the author that an apolitical army manning the booths will ruin the grand plans of the communists? If Chatterjee would have his way, then the rotten polling process will remain the same as ever and none can ever expect a free and fair election in the state.

 Yours faithfully,

Shubhankar Dam, Oxford, UK

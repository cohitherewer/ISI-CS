 THE CHALICE OF SPORTS

 The Jules Rimet trophy

 Complete book of the World Cup 2006 By Cris Freddi, HarperSports, ? 7.99

 Why was Lev Yashin considered the finest of goal-tenders? Why does Garrincha still evoke awe and wonder? Whose goal stunned the 2,00,000 Maracan? Stadium crowd into stunned silence? Answers to these and many more questions can be found within the 404 pages of the Complete Book of the World Cup 2006.

 The paperback is full of information and illustrations related to ?the greatest spectacle in the world of sports?. Tracing back from the inaugural World Cup in 1930 at Montevideo in Uruguay, the history of the last 17 World Cup championships have been meticulously traced. Every match has been graphically covered, mentioning the result, the respective teams, the goal scorers as well as the match highlights.

 India was kept out of the World Cup in 1950 because it wanted to play barefoot as it had done in the 1948 Olympics. But Fifa refused to comply. That very year, the host, Brazil, had also invited Burma and Philippines to form the Asian group, and to qualify for the actual championship. Unfortunately none of the three teams showed the urge to compete. 

 The first Asian team to play in the football World Cup was Indonesia (then the Dutch East Indies), which played in the third World Cup, in 1938. It put up a miserable show, losing by six goals to nil. The third World Cup was played in France while Nazi Germany had overrun Austria. The German football authorities selected the best of Austrian players in the German team. However, that did not help, as Germany lost to Switzerland. 

 The first team from Africa to play in the World Cup is not one of the main contenders from Africa today. Egypt played first from Africa in the second World Cup at Italy in 1934, at a time when Benito Mussolini took over the World Cup to propagate his own achievements. 

 In India we are told by our ?experts? that soccer became popular in the United States of America only after the arrival of Pel? and Beckenbauer in the mid-Seventies. But soccer in the US is still not as popular as basketball and baseball, though it has been played there quite seriously for decades. The US took part in the first World Cup at Uruguay in 1930. 

 The author, Cris Freddi, apart from delving deep into Fifa?s official records, has very pragmatically documented serious contributions from around the globe in this work. The magic of Didi, Vav?, Pel?, Maradona, Eusebio, Beckenbauer, Platini has been highlighted, as also the outstanding contributions of Tost?o, Riva, Baggio, M?ller. At the same time, the glorious exploits of Ronaldinho, Kak?, Messi, Rooney and other familiar names of modern day soccer have received due adulation.

 The artistry of the Brazilian players, the never-say-die spirit of Germany, the introduction of total football by Holland, the finesse of France, the magnificence of Argentina, as well as the rise of the Dark Continent have been brilliantly described.

 Thankfully, Freddi has also mentioned that England is a perpetually overrated team which has not achieved anything of note except for the 1966 victory at home under extremely controversial circumstances. 

 This book would reveal how experts tend to undervalue teams like Czechoslovakia, Sweden and Holland. These nations over the years have done extremely well in the World Cup championships but have been deprived of their rightful due. This is indeed a complete book and an ideal copy for reference.

 Letters to Editor

 Scared out of their wits

 Sir ? It is shocking to read about the suicide of poultry farmers in Arambagh following the bird-flu scare (?Potato and poultry take their toll?, March 14). It is even more heart-rending to think that the responsibility lies with the government officials whose contradictory statements caused the panic.Why is there no clear statement from the authorities on the situation almost a month after the first alert was issued? Till the crisis blows over, the poultry industry should be adequately compensated to prevent mass suicides.

 Yours faithfully, 

Anirban Rudra, Calcutta

 Stand alone

 Sir ? As the assembly elections in Bengal approach, the antics of the political parties get increasingly hilarious. The state Congress president, Pranab Mukherjee, has dashed Mamata Banerjee?s hopes to forge an electoral understanding with his party (?Congress rejects Mamata? March 16). Mukherjee, in fact, has tactfully kept Banerjee at bay by making the Trinamool Congress?s snapping all ties with the Bharatiya Janata Party a prerequisite to an alliance with the Congress. On her part, Banerjee has given the electorate little confidence by keeping 93 out of 294 seats open for the Congress, a party she once accused of being the CPI(M)?s B-team. 

 One has to remember that Banerjee?s influence in West Bengal has weakened considerably. Her love for the Congress is thus not unnatural. But she should get her priorities right first and stop making a fool of herself.

Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Pranab Mukherjee has successfully foiled the possibility of a joint fight against the Left Front. He has offered Mamata Banerjee?s links with the BJP, which he alleges to be against ?national compulsions?, as the pretext for his rejection of Banerjee?s proposal of a mahajot. The national policy of the Congress at present is to join hands with the left at the Centre to keep the National Democratic Alliance out. Then how is it that the Congress is fighting the left in Bengal? Or has Mukherjee arranged for a mock-fight in the state to ensure the Left Front?s victory here, and therefore a more sustained alliance with the left at the Centre?

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? With rare cunning Pranab Mukherjee has spoilt the chances of a Trinamool Congress victory over the left. It is evident that Mukherjee has hardly any sympathy for the people of West Bengal or even his own party in the state. He is only focussed on furthering his own political interests as a politician on the national platform. Adhir Choudhury, caught in legal wrangles, can hardly satisfy that ambition. So he is trying to please the ruling party in the state at all costs. The fate of the Congress in West Bengal is doomed if the party continues to spurn Banerjee?s offer for a mahajot. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Kaushik Banerjee, Rishra

 Sir ? Mamata Banerjee?s political manoeuvrings have begun to take a toll on her party?s image. The defeat of the Trinamool Congress in the last municipal elections has proved that people are no longer convinced of her political strength. And her erstwhile ally, the Congress, is unwilling to put its national stand vis-?-vis the BJP at stake for an electoral understanding with her. The Congress can dispense with Banerjee so easily because she is no longer a force to reckon with. Such an abrupt fall in Banerjee?s fortune can be attributed to her own whimsical position on every issue. She has lost the trust of her supporters. And now her fair-weather friends have no interest in her.

Yours faithfully, 

S. Mukherjee, Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 SPEAKING AN ALIEN TONGUE 

Stephen Hugh-Jones

 Does a specifically Indian English really exist, I asked two weeks ago. Should that perhaps read ?Indian Englishes?? And how far can one push the idea that any group?s English is as valid as any other?s? All three questions are linked.

 You may think it an imperial impertinence even to ask the first one. Yet the answer was by no means always self-evident. Take Nehru?s Glimpses of World History, published in 1934. This clearly was an Indian writing for Indians; his daughter Indira, to be precise. He uses plenty of Indian terms: zamindari, bania, panchayat, hartal, for example. But there?s barely a trace of Indian style. Here is a British-educated writer writing like any other.

 By now, Indian English there plainly is, with its own vernacular. That a four-twenty could not be British English is natural; 420 has no place in British criminal law. But eve-teaser could be, yet it isn?t. There are many such strictly Indian-English words and phrases.

 Add Indian syntax and we are well apart. Newly settled in Mumbai in 1961, to work on the Indian Express, I was mystified to be asked, ?You are staying Colaba-side, isn?t it?? It was kindly interpreted for me: ?You live in Colaba, don?t you??

 Rich mix

 The phrase, normal to its user, bizarre to me, raises our second question: Indian English or Englishes? There are 108 varieties, wrote one contributor to a 1986 study of the topic in that excellent monthly Seminar (108, by the way, being a purely Indian usage).

 The most obvious variations are those of accent. Even I could tell these differed from region to region, no doubt reflecting the local vernacular. My many colleagues from Kerala baffled me with their high-speed, slippery English, as North Indians did not. Class counts too: the Doon School accent of a friend of mine must sound as strange, however elegant, to most Indians as it did to me.

 In print, distinctions show up in a mix of vocabulary, syntax and, more subtly, style. I?m told these too vary by region. Yet do they at the literary level? I?ve recently read Gita Mehta, Amit Chaudhuri, Arundhati Roy and, from an earlier generation, Attia Hosain; geographically, a pretty catholic selection. In subject matter and vocabulary they vary regionally, for sure. Yet stylistically all four, to me, could be British writers telling the same tales. Anita Desai has called Attia Hosain?s style ?rich and ornate as a piece of brocade... [she] is reproducing the Persian literary style she was taught when young.? Really? I?m not qualified to dispute it. But I find Hosain?s style plain enough; for brocade, try Henry James or Conrad.

 Class difference

 In contrast, the most insular Briton can spot the ?class? differences among Indian Englishes, reflecting different levels of familiarity with the language. My ex-Doon School friend would not have found that query about Colaba as baffling, but just as barbarous as I did.

 So, I fancy, would many Telegraph readers. Is such a phrase Indian English at all? Isn?t it just bad English? Here comes our third question. Let?s agree Indian English exists, as valid as any other. But with caveats. At high levels, it is not easily distinguished from older rivals; it comes in umpteen varieties; and the most Indian of these ? naturally, English being still largely an imported language ? are those of users to whom it is still an alien tongue. Are their Englishes as valid as any other? Maybe. But think of the pidgin of the Pacific before you leap to that politically correct answer.

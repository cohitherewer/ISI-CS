 NEW SALVE TO OLD ILLS

 Malvika Singh

 One thing that emerges clearly from the protests in West Bengal over the Tata Motors project is a sane land-use policy that will help keep the many potential problems of future industrial proposals at bay. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is a very sensible man, erudite and compassionate. He comprehends well that farmers and agriculture are a priority as is industrialization. He is a chief minister who will be more than willing to sit around a table and thrash out fresh approaches to old problems and initiate new and energetic policy initiatives that would be inclusive and beneficial to all sectors of the economic space. Why is he being damned by the like-minded? Why are gheraos and dharnas seen to be effective when the same protesters could have a fruitful dialogue with the chief minister on the issue? Where is the voice of the corporate sector, the CIIs of the world, on the pros and cons of taking over prime agricultural land? Why are they not demanding a proper and comprehensive, modern land-use policy for smooth transitions? Why is the corporate intervention non-existent, so utterly simplistic and intellectually limited? Where is Ratan Tata in all this? What is his thinking, reaction and position on the ongoing conflict? 

 It would be encouraging and heartening to see a substantial dialogue emerge from this one reality on the ground. It could set a trend and enforce sustainable change and a shifting of gears. Medha Patkar and other activists as well as political entities must work towards a solution and not merely stall change and growth. In the stale and predictable style of protest that we have been witnessing over the weeks, the regulars missing were the Brinda Karats of the world! I suppose that band, which is always at such dharnas et al, could not defy its chief minister and the politburos decision to go ahead with the small car project. It is this kind of hypocrisy that dilutes the potential strength of public protest. 

 Come forward

 In India, compensation is always a tricky issue. Because of rampant corruption, more often than not, the real value of the price of land is never fully declared and transactions are done in black and white. When the government takes over land, the virtual family silver, it actually ends up paying half the true market rate because it only deals in white! Is this fair? Surely rich corporates can afford the market rate of the land they need to build their enterprises. Why can they not negotiate directly? They want freedom from government controls on the one hand and want the government to be their dalal and agent, on the other. These double standards make a mockery of the many other freedoms they constantly demand. 

 To rationalize this exploitative reality, market-rate compensation must be paid by the buyer, all in white. The corporate sector will think twice about where to set up their factories if this comes into play. They will begin to look at less fertile tracts, drylands and suchlike, often further out and away from metropolitan areas, which they will be able to acquire for reasonable money. Today they are using the government to acquire prime land for the price of degraded land. They must cease to use the government to squeeze out lucrative deals for themselves at the cost of the citizen. 

 Ratan Tata could set an example, a precedent, by agreeing to develop and enhance the same acreage of degraded land elsewhere in the state as part of the package. He could give back and help the development of poorer and underprivileged areas that desperately need a direct input and not merely the trickle-down effect. He will then have participated in a private-public joint venture in the true sense of the term. This is the kind of pioneering impact that the corporate sector needs to make on the forgotten India, the India that needs to join the development process for this nation to become a superpower.

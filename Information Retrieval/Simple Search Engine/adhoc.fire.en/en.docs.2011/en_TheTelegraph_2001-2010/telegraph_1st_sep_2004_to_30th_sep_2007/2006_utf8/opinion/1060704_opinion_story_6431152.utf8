 BEIJING IS NOT FAR FROM DELHI

 When scholars sit down to talk about how India can become a great power of the future, the discussion invariably boils down to China, writes Jyoti Malhotra

 A model to replicate

 There?s nothing like Sri Lanka to concentrate the mind when it comes to a discussion on terrorism. Last week, even as the German NGO, Friedrich Ebert Stiftung, was hosting a conference on the state of the India-Pakistan peace process, via Kashmir of course, a sunny-side-up island morning was rent apart with news of a Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam suicide bomber successfully meeting his destiny in the shape of a top Sri Lankan general.

 But it wasn?t until both sides, sitting around a square table, had gone through the process of reordering each other?s affairs in their own image, that the subject of China really came up. In fact, it was a bit of an afterthought, what with both sides so consumed with the mess in Kashmir, the bureaucracy in India, the army in Pakistan, the compulsions of Pervez Musharraf caught between Allah and America, as well as the sense of schizophrenia between Manmohan Singh and the Congress, to have focussed on Asia?s biggest power for any sustained period of time.

 Still, having made the connection, the Indian participants, interestingly, were reluctant to let up. See how India and China had put their border dispute on the backburner, they said, even as they concentrated on sending trade figures through the roof (last heard it had crossed $10 billion, and who cared if as much as 70 per cent of Indian exports consisted of raw iron and steel). So why couldn?t India and Pakistan do the same with Kashmir?

 So when the MIT-India Consortium Summit beckoned a few days later, back in the heat and humidity of Delhi, it seemed like one was entering a brave new world. Here the talk was all about India as a future great power, how it could get there, and what it could learn from the competition. In one word, China.

 Point was, as two American scholars of Chinese origin who set the pace that morning emphasized, China had become part of the world elite by building a world-class infrastructure that had gone hand in hand with maintaining a punishing pace of economic reform. So how had China done it?

 Professor Yingyi Qian of the University of California, Berkeley, used his case study of the Hangzhou Bay Bridge that was being built between Ningbo and Shanghai to illustrate his point. (Hardly anyone in the audience remembered that Atal Bihari Vajpayee was visiting Hangzhou as foreign minister in 1978, when China invaded India-friendly Vietnam, leading Vajpayee to cut short his visit of China, thereby putting the relationship into deep freeze for another decade.)

 When built by 2009, the Hangzhou bridge is going to be the longest bridge in the world. Interestingly, while no foreign funding had gone into its construction, private investors had put in just over half the money. What was key to the China story, Professor Yingyi pointed out, was that while the Communist Party of China pushed Chinese banks to give bank loans to Chinese entrepreneurs, it was the local state government that took responsibility for the completion of the project. In other words, it was imperative for the government to develop a stake in the privately-funded dam/bridge/expressway.

 Then it was the turn of Professor Yasheng Huang of the MIT Sloan School of Management to prove his money?s worth. Should Mumbai be like Shanghai, he asked? That?s when he proceeded to trash the CPC?s predilection for littering the landscape with the tallest and grandest buildings, much to the shock and awe of his elite audience.

 Professor Yasheng pointed out that much of these large buildings ? and a number of them were in Shanghai ? were actually empty. The CPC had been pouring money into ?infrastructure,? but at the cost of ?soft power? issues like education and health. No country could be truly great following that path to stardom, he said. Mumbai, for example, should know ? as should the rest of the world ? that China witnessed 85,000 violent street protests in 2005 against forcible land seizures and corruption, while 30 million grievance petitions were filed.

 Deifying Pudong ? once a marshland across the river in Shanghai, but now the showpiece of socialism with Chinese characteristics ? Professor Yasheng added, was hardly worth it. Considering the electricity to light up all those brilliant buildings was drawn from nearby Zhejiang province, which would regularly experience shortfalls as a result.

 The backbone of the Chinese economic reform, he said, had in fact been the investment into education during the Sixties and Seventies, although even the good American professor hesitated to give credit to the ?Cultural Revolution? years. Another significant omission on his part, which he later made good over kadhai murg at lunch: since Hu Jintao had become the most powerful man in all of China in 2003, he had ordered sweeping changes in national education/health policies, which could become the basis for a second wave of information-fuelled reform.

 So what was the message Mumbai should, in the end, draw from Shanghai? People?s power first, a prerequisite of which was to empower the people with a good education. Plus, at a critical stage, introduce the required state-led modernizations, so that the people are maximally prepared for both the pain and gain of economic reform. Only then can the whole become more than a sum of its parts.

 Clearly, the most tantalizing part of MIT-India?s vision of the world was that India was within reach of the Chinese success story. And while it wasn?t important to replicate that model, according to Lant Pritchett, the World Bank?s leading south Asia economist, India needed to realize that it was critically important to actually deliver what was once promised. The state needed to be trusted by its people, that was the bottomline. Whether it was in electricity reform, building quality infrastructure or putting a man on the moon, the state, like Caesar?s wife, could not be seen to be fallible. China scored much higher on this front, Pritchett said, compared to India.

 Clearly, too, it was not in the MIT conference?s brief to point out that Beijing was pursuing border negotiations with India in an effort to resolve the 42-year-old bilateral, border dispute ? India is the only country with which China continues to have a border dispute today ? because it wanted to focus all its energies on building a world-class nation.

 In this sense, however, China provides an all-important example to India ? an allusion to which some seminar participants could not help but make. Which is, if India seeks to continue to grow at 9 per cent per annum, it will soon have no option but to proactively address the concerns of its neighbourhood, so as to create a sense of collective security.

 Some believe that a creative relook at the Kashmir dispute might be one good way to start.

 Scary picture

 Sir The report, More the men less safe the world (Aug 30), raises serious questions about the future of human civilization. With abortion of female foetuses on the rise, it does seem likely that women are on their way to becoming an endangered species. The researchers seem to be worried about the fact that anti-social behaviour among men will rise even as they fail to find female partners. But the scientists have little reason to worry. Men have a natural propensity towards violence and this is not diminished by having female companions. And even if the killing spree increases, then men will kill other men only. That will at least help bring down the disparity in the sex ratio. 

 It is not merely the killing of female foetuses that results in fewer women of marriageable age. Most Indian families are still hesitant when it comes to accepting inter-caste marriages. If caste prejudices are done away with, then there will be more women of marriageable age available for men. Moreover, the concept of marriageable age needs to be redefined. Any woman who is an adult should be able to marry. But women over twenty are often thought to have lost their attractiveness and desirability in our society. This is nothing but stereotypical thinking and this will have to change. 

 Instead of speculating on a society with more men then women, it would be better if one started taking effective measures to thwart such a possibility. The killing of female foetuses is an outrageous crime and the parents who give their consent to such an action are guilty of homicide. If they are punished under laws pertaining to murder, then the heinous practice will stop soon. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Datta, Calcutta

 Sir One of the many ills of modern science is the invention of technology that makes the determination of the sex of a foetus possible. This has made the abortion of female foetuses rampant in countries like China and India. The preference for a male child over a female is bound to disrupt the social structure sooner or later. Indians should be warned of an imminent disaster if they continue with such malpractices. Not only the parents but also the doctors who perform the operation need to be punished severely. It is deplorable that the Union government has remained slack about cases of female foeticide in spite of their frightening recurrence. Should the number of women in India fall radically in the coming years, then the government would stand equally guilty of the crime. 

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir There is no doubt that abortion of female foetuses is a reprehensible act. However the dire predictions of researchers about men being unable to marry as women grow fewer in number may not be true. The Indian social structure is such that grooms will always be in high demand. States like Punjab and Haryana where the rate of abortion of female foetuses is the highest are also the ones in which the girls families pay whopping amounts as dowries to the grooms. If men were in surplus, then they could not have commanded such a high price in the marriage market. 

 There is no need to feel sorry for the hapless men who would supposedly be left with no woman to mate with. The males in all species fight fiercely among themselves to be the privileged procreator. Nature guarantees that the strongest male wins the battle, thus ensuring the propagation of the healthiest genes. Whether women are available in abundant numbers or not, the weaker males will always lose out in the fight for survival. 

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Pal, Batanagar

 Sir There has to be equal number of men and women on earth so that the natural balance remains intact. Tilting this fragile balance can only spell doom. If female foeticide and infanticide are not checked immediately, then there are reasons to be apprehensive about the future of this planet. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Caught in the web

 Sir The suicide by fourteen-year-old Gobinda Mukherjee puts one to shame. Suicides among adults are on the rise but Gobindas case is doubly tragic because the boy had to work hard to support his family at a young age. He must have felt humiliated when his mother rebuked him for demanding Rs 10 for going to a mela. The boys demand was not unjustified, given the fact that he worked hard and contributed to the family income. He rightly felt that his mother was denying him his well-earned leisure. Adults often take recourse to corporal punishment to discipline their wards without thinking of the possible psychological effects. It is parents insensitivity to children that results in unfortunate deaths like these. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sekhar Basu Mallik, Calcutta

 Sir The tragic death of Gobinda proves that the government legislation banning child labour remains just eyewash. Gobinda had to toil from 8 am till 8.30 pm everyday to earn a meagre Rs 400 at the end of the month. The boy must have been bitterly disappointed when his mother rejected his demand for Rs 10. At the same time, one cannot blame the mother since even a paltry sum of ten rupees means a lot to poor people like her. If anybody is to be held responsible for Gobindas suicide, it is the government that remains indifferent to the plight of the poor.

 Yours faithfully,

Sharmistha Ghosh, Siliguri

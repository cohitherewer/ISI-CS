 PARTY SQUABBLES

 Partisan squabbles for power are often given euphemistic names. Such tussles within a communist party are called ?inner-party struggles?. The open war within the Kerala unit of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), though, has little ideological pretension. The abuses that the party?s rival factions are hurling at one another fit into the tradition of communist parties. One has only to recall the CPI(M)?s hatred of the Communist Party of India for many years after the 1964 split in the parent party. The coming assembly polls in Kerala have only sharpened the battlelines between the state party secretary, Mr Pinarayi Vijayan, and Mr V.S. Achuthanandan, both members of the CPI(M)?s politburo. The party?s decision to deny an assembly ticket to Mr Achuthanandan has sparked the latest crisis; but the feud has been openly there for a long time. The latest showdown should demolish the myth that the CPI(M) is a monolithic party. It also shows that the party?s organizational discipline can be vulnerable to stresses. The fact that even the intervention of the party?s general secretary, Mr Prakash Karat, has failed to resolve the crisis in Kerala proves the point. 

 There are two other aspects of the feud that could lead to significant changes for Kerala. First, it could mar the prospects of the CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front in the elections. The LDF was widely expected to return to power. The parliamentary polls of 2004 and the recent municipal elections confirmed the growing unpopularity of the Congress-led United Democratic Front government. The exit of former chief minister, Mr K. Karunakaran, from the Congress was also expected to help the left in the assembly polls. If the crisis within the CPI(M) leads to the LDF?s defeat, it may prove costly for the party and the left as a whole in national politics as well. Second, the row is linked to the debate within the CPI(M) on economic reforms. Mr Vijayan is known to be open to reformist ideas, much like Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. But while Mr Bhattacharjee has the support of a majority of the party leaders in Bengal on most economic issues, the two factions in Kerala are sharply divided on these. Mr Achuthanandan, a senior trade union leader, is a bitter critic of Mr Vijayan?s reformist agenda. If the LDF returns to power, the CPI(M)?s problem can have its impact on the state?s economy.

 Letters to Editor

 Bitter dose

 Sir ? The report, ?Karat chop chokes guru?s breath? (Jan 4), does not come as a surprise. Only a few years back, a clinic in Hardwar, which used to insert full-page advertisements in leading national dailies claiming total cure of epilepsy, was found to administer large doses of sleeping pills to hapless patients and reap huge profits. There are innumerable spurious drug rackets operating in the country. Even some of the well-known ?herbal? medicines have been found to contain a high percentage of metals and have hence been banned in the United States of America. Unless the government takes stringent measures, the drug traders and fake clinics will continue to thrive and multiply at the cost of gullible patients.

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Sir ? Ramdev has, with his exceptional skills in oratory, and a 24-hour channel at his disposal, acquired a huge following which includes high-profile politicians and filmstars. He also has the entrepreneurial and marketing acumen to run an entire pharmaceutical unit. It would have been acceptable if he had confined himself to teaching yoga and delivering sermons. But since he has ventured into the manufacture and sale of medicine, it is his responsibility to ensure that what he sells to unsuspecting consumers are made from permitted substances. If the allegations against him are proved to be true, people will think twice before going in for similar ayurvedic cures for their ailments. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sourav Sengupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? Using human and animal body parts is a practice resorted to by mainstream medicine too. Health tonics contain animal liver extracts and phosphorous from bones, animal and human. Tonics for anaemia contain cattle blood. Human blood, serum, tissues and organs are regularly transplanted. Animal organs and blood too are being actively considered for transplants. Capsules use gelatine from animal bones. Animal and human serum form the main contents of vaccines. And what, pray, is stem cell therapy? Bones cannot genetically contaminate a person, but human and animal serum definitely do. So the ?exposure? of Ramdev?s medicines isn?t an exposure after all. Allopathic medicines sometimes kill and maim without curing. At least the swami is curing people. And as far as human skulls are concerned, Ramdev has to be a billionaire to procure as many skulls as producing medicine in bulk would require. 

 Yours faithfully,

Jagannath Chatterjee, Bhubaneswar

 Sir ? Whatever the substance in the allegation against him, Ramdev has public sympathy on his side. Given his huge following, matters might take a bad turn if his medicines are found to contain forbidden substances. The government should intervene instead of letting Brinda Karat and Ramdev defame each other in public.

 Yours faithfully, 

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Ramdev is getting a raw deal from the television channels which are trying to portray him as a fraud after Brinda Karat?s allegations. Ramdev?s open challenge to any national or international laboratory to test his medicines should be taken up before launching into an attack against him. It is possible that the samples sent by Karat to the Union health ministry are not from Ramdev?s pharmacy, or have been tampered with before being sent, at the behest of multinational pharmaceutical companies which have suffered losses after Ramdev?s ayurvedic medicines became popular. The government should send fresh sealed samples for testing. Soft drinks marketed by MNCs have been proved to contain harmful chemicals and yet they continue to be sold openly. Why doesn?t Karat and her comrades file cases against these MNCs first? 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhash Chandra Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? Ramdev might use animal bones in his medicines, but this is less important than the fact that hundreds have recovered from severe illnesses after taking them. 

 Yours faithfully,

Jaita Panda, Rourkela

 Sir ? Ramdev is doing invaluable service not only for India but for the entire world by asking people to take care of their health and improve it further by doing yoga. The charges levelled by Brinda Karat against him carry no weight. There are too many people whose faith in him will not be shaken by such flimsy accusations.

 Yours faithfully,

Suman Barthakur, Guwahati

 Sir ? If Ramdev is only concerned about the health of Indians and doesn?t care at all about the business prospects of his pharmacy, then why is he unleashing extreme right wing political messages against Brinda Karat? And if curing people is his sole aim, then why doesn?t he have the guts to say, ?Yes, I have used animal matter, but it is necessary to cure those deadly diseases?. If there was transparency in the manufacture of his medicines, the controversy would not have arisen. 

 Yours faithfully,

Anwesha Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is impossible to take sides in the Brinda Karat-Ramdev controversy, because both communists and godmen are there to deceive people and make a living. We have also learnt that the jobs of drug inspectors and MPs are interchangeable. Maybe we should start sending pharmacists to parliament. In the Sixties, communists spearheaded the anti-MNC movement. Today they are accused of working for the MNCs. Could anything be more ironic?

 Yours faithfully, 

Chameli Pal, Batanagar

 Sir ? The reaction of the Congress and its coalition allies to the attack on the Communist Party of India (Marxist)?s Delhi office by the Ramdev?s followers was surprising (?Secular allies dump CPM over Ramdev?, Jan 6). It is a pity that the ruling alliance has chosen to remain silent on the issue. How long do Indians have to suffer these so-called ?gurus? and be an object of ridicule to the world? 

 Yours faithfully, 

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

 NEW ROBES

 Women are the gateway, if not to hell, then at least to a lot of unnecessary complications. None of the hullabaloo over women priests ? and now women bishops ? would have happened had they quietly stayed in the places ordained by theologically competent men, arranging flowers, fetes and jumble sales or shrinking into cloisters and running schools when the ?calling? grew too strong. But such peace is not meant to last: it was in 1994 when women?s desire to be equal before god compelled the Anglican church to allow them into its priesthood. And now there is no stopping them. One report shows that 50 per cent of entrants into Britain?s seminaries are women. So meteoric has been their rise in the church ? a model for all women entering professions that men have for long been clutching on to for dear life ? that the Church of England has just voted in plans for women bishops. In cosmic time, this is not a lot. Two thousand years only.

 The decision may be logical but it is certainly not conducive to peace and goodwill. There is already some frost between Canterbury and Rome over women priests, and the recent election of Ms Katharine Jefferts Schori as bishop by the Episcopal church in the United States of America has not only exacerbated that, but has also begun to drive apart the traditionalists and liberals within the worldwide Anglican communion. Some Anglican churches in Africa, for example, have made clear that they do not wish to see women in positions of authority. Unfortunately for the male executors of god?s will, women, whether Catholic or Anglican, have discovered that there are no real arguments against women?s ordination. It is claimed that there were no women at the Last Supper, just as it is claimed that man was made in god?s image. Since neither is verifiable, it is a little difficult to brandish these as logic for more than 2000 years. The Vatican is still hoping it can be done, threatening the few American, German, Austrian and South African women who have been ordained as priests with excommunication. There is real danger of a serious rift between traditionalists and liberals in the Anglican church over the women bishops issue. The old wives? tales are right as usual: women are a bunch of trouble.

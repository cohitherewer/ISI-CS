 Letters to Editor

 Way of all faiths

 Sir ? How soon will our temples have corporate governance (?Temple titans in temporal tryst?, Jan,5)? Perhaps the representatives of the major Indian temples will be able to decide after they meet at a five-star hotel in Mumbai. Although religious discussions are not on the agenda, it would be worthwhile to take advantage of the sideline talk to drive home the point that people of all faiths be allowed entry into our temples. If permission is denied to foreigners, glass enclosures can be created for them. Universal love and brotherhood form the essence of Hinduism.

 Yours faithfully,

 A.K. Ghosh, Calcutta

 Grim harvest

 Sir ? What happened in Raghopur, the constituency of Bihar?s former chief minister, Rabri Devi, is one of the most barbaric acts of recent times (?Family roasted in caste cauldron?, Jan 2). Though social tensions have been an integral part of Bihar for the last couple of decades, with frequent clashes between caste-based private armies, the burning alive of a pregnant woman and her children is unprecedented. The allegations brought by the villagers against the officer-in-charge of the Raghopur police station, Nuruddin Khan, speak volumes of the state of affairs in Bihar?s villages. Raghopur being a Yadav-dominated area, the backward Kahar community must be given protection. The swearing-in of the new government should not be allowed to boost the revival manoeuvres of the militant upper castes. More important, the killings must not be made fodder for vote-bank politics.

 Yours faithfully, 

Koyel Basu, Calcutta.

 Sir ? The ghastly killing of Bijendra Mahto?s wife and children in Raghopur is a grim reminder of the task that lies ahead of the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar. Caste violence shows no signs of abating in the state. Hopefully, under the new regime, the killers will be punished at the earliest.

 Yours faithfully,

B.K. Mahapatro, Berhampur, Orissa

 Sir ? It appears that the Janata Dal (United)-Bharatiya Janata Party government?s political rivals have been swift to capitalize on the Raghopur massacre. While Lalu Prasad has typically tried to blame Nitish Kumar for the killings, Ram Vilas Paswan has gone to the ludicrous extent of claiming the dead as his own ? remember that five of the killed were children ? by labelling the victims, wrongly, as Dalits. This only proves that the architects of Bihar?s decline have not learnt any lesson from their humiliating defeat.

 Yours faithfully,

Megha A, Hyderabad

 Sir ? The new year began with the horrible massacre in Raghopur. It is appalling that a pregnant woman and her five children could be torched alive over the theft of a buffalo. In Bihar, cast and class fights are not uncommon and the police have become blas? about such incidents. In the Raghopur case too, Nuruddin Khan?s negligence and greed were criminal. It is no use forming inquiry committees, for they cannot prevent incidents like this from happening. The people must learn the lessons of humanity, and the police have to do their duty.

 Yours faithfully,

Mohd. Mudassir Alam, New Delhi 

 Sir ? The police in Bihar have long been reduced to spectators of crime. The Raghopur massacre has proved that they are now covert perpetrators as well. The frustrated outburst of the villagers of Rampur during the chief minister?s visit is entirely justified (?Furious villagers rant at Nitish?, Jan 2). Inquiries are a farce, since they are conducted by people who are neck-deep in corruption. The media too are to blame for failing to follow up stories once they lose their sensation value. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

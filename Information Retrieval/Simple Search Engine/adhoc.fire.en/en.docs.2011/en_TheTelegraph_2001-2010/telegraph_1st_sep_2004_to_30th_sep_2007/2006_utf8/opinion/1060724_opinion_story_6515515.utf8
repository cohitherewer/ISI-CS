 ENGLISH AGAIN

 Mopping up the English-language mess will be a difficult affair for the West Bengal government. The deeply misjudged and wrong-headed experiments with language teaching in primary education that the Left Front conducted throughout the Eighties and Nineties have left generations of students internally divided and irreversibly disadvantaged. The higher education minister, Mr Sudarshan Raychaudhuri, has now announced certain measures targeting students joining professional courses. English language ?laboratories? are going to be attached to professional institutes and teacher-training colleges in order to bring communication-skills in English up to the mark. To devise such ad hoc measures without rectifying the entire urban and rural infrastructure of English-teaching is perhaps yet another cosmetic approach to the entire problem.

 The situation is made worse by the government?s attitude to its own past errors. The school education minister, Mr Partha De, has argued in the assembly that the state?s language-teaching policy in the Eighties was in response to the demands of the times, and hence a perfectly logical one, as is the change now. The government has also recently disagreed with the grades awarded to the state colleges by the national assessment and accreditation council, and is thinking of forming its own evaluation committee. Mr Raychaudhuri has claimed that in the changing global scenario, just a Central accreditation would not be quite enough. The state colleges need to be evaluated according to ?international? standards. Hence the need for a state-level committee. A dogged inability to admit failure, together with a general lack of vision and expertise, continues to jeopardize the lives of students and young people in Bengal.

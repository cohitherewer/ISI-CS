 BACK TO THE WAR FRONT 

 Nehru in China

 India and the World: Selected Articles from IDSA Journals Volume 1 Strategic Thought: The Formative Years Edited by N.S. Sisodia and Sujit Dutta, IDSA Promilla, Rs 1,175

 The institute for Defence Studies and Analyses is a premier institution in south Asia for strategic studies. It brings out two journals: Strategic Analysis (called IDSA Journal before 1987) and Strategic Digest. The latter is a compilation of reports from other foreign publications. The former carries articles by fellows of IDSA, who mostly comprise military officers and personnel from the Indian foreign service. Nevertheless, occasionally, foreign academicians, senior military officers and bureaucrats contribute to Strategic Analysis. And this opens up a window to the overtly secretive Indian strategic managers? thought process.

 The IDSA, set up in 1965 as a semi-autonomous institution, was modelled after the RAND Corporation of the US and Institute of Strategic Studies, London. Its job is not only to promote consciousness regarding India?s defence among the informed public but also to aid the government in formulating the national security policy. The journals of the IDSA provide a forum to debate and discuss some burning issues.

 In the volume under review, about 20 selected articles published during the first two decades of the IDSA are included. They fall into two categories: those dealing with grand strategy and those with military strategy. Among the former group of articles, one of the most powerful is by K. Subrahmanyam. Written in 1972, it evaluates Nehru?s strategic theory. Subrahmanyam asserts that Nehru was a realist, aware of the inevitability of conflict with Pakistan and China. He equipped the armed forces adequately to face Islamabad. But Nehru also realized that against the armed might of China, India did not stand a chance and had no way to stop it from absorbing Tibet. So he attempted to accommodate Beijing?s demand through diplomatic means. When the bullets started flying, the Indian generals bungled.

 Max Jean Zins? essay of 1986 supports the argument of Subrahmanyam. A recent strand of thought sees Nehru as an ultra-realist who operated under the smokescreen of the non-aligned movement. But a majority of military officers will not agree with the interpretation that the Indian army is to be blamed for the catastrophe in the Himalayas.

 On military affairs, the best article is by Stephen P. Cohen, published in 1969. He rightly argues that the principal task of the Indian army is internal rather than external defence. So, the Indian decision-makers should use the army in nation-building ? aid to civil duties, flood and famine relief. Influenced by the modernization theory, Cohen assumes that the army?s participation in such non-combat duties will upgrade India?s civil infrastructure. The generals might counter-argue that overemphasis on non-combat duties might result in inadequate combat training for the military.

 Those who are outside the orbit of the IDSA but are students of strategic studies are aware of the limitations of the institution. If IDSA has to reach the level of PRIO Oslo, SIPRI Stockholm, Stimson Center US, then it has to be truly autonomous with regard to recruitment of fellows and day-to-day functioning. Just because the Indian defence and foreign ministries fund the organization, it does not mean that they could use the IDSA to suit their purpose. Despite the shortcomings, the IDSA remains the only one of its kind in India.

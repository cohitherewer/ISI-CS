The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 THREE PROTESTERS

 It has become easy to dismiss or trivialize public protest in India. ?Activism? is perceived as falling into one of three categories: fashionable left-liberalism (Arundhati Roy), Hindu right-wing lunacy (Shiv Sainiks against Valentine?s Day), and the Bengal bandhs. The construction of the Sardar Sarovar Dam on the Narmada has long provided a focus for activism, primarily embodied by Ms Medha Patkar and the Narmada Bachao Andolan. That history of active resistance has now come to some sort of a head, with three different forms of protest taking place simultaneously, none of which is easy to slot into the categories above. Ms Patkar?s hunger-strike, Amir Khan?s public support of Ms Patkar, and Mr Narendra Modi?s 51-hour fast by the Sabarmati are three different kinds of gesture, each having something to say about civil society and the polity in India.

 If Mr Modi?s fasting is an expression of, rather than a protest against, partisan politics, then Khan?s support of the NBA?s absolutist position is just the opposite. And this is where his use of Rang De Basanti, and of the particular idea of a national conscience that the film tries to dramatize, are significant. The message here is that the focus of the Narmada issue has been lost in a labyrinth of party-political, and ultimately electoral, interests, which are deliberately obscuring the real stakes in the situation ? the thousands of displaced tribals and their rehabilitation. Whatever the qualms felt by other activists regarding the entry of celebrity into such an arena, the need to see the entire issue as an essentially human one, and thereby to identify unequivocally, and simply, who the victims are remain the focus of Khan?s protest. Of course, Khan?s support for the NBA has made him confront the implications, vis-?-vis the Plachimada protests, of being the brand ambassador for Coke. But misgivings regarding the pitfalls of celebrity endorsement should not deflect attention from the idea of the active citizen, ?alive to events happening around?, that informs Khan?s presence at Jantar Mantar. Every political leader and bureaucrat, from the prime minister and the water resources minister, to members of the Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party in Gujarat and Delhi seem to have lost sight of the facts of the case for the sake of a range of political stakes. This is what the active citizen?s protest must address in no ambiguous terms.

 TRIAL AND ERROR

 GWYNNE DYER

 It?s easy to tell the difference between the trial of Saddam Hussein and the Nuremberg tribunal. That was a grave and dignified affair; Saddam?s trial is more like a French farce, with a large and confusing cast of characters who rush onto the stage to deliver a few lines and then vanish again. But it?s a pretty black comedy: seven people associated with the trial, including two defence lawyers, have been assassinated since it began and another defence lawyer has fled Iraq fearing for his life.

 The court has only been in session for eight days since October, and the last day was the worst yet. The new chief judge, Raouf Abdel-Rahman, took over with such a heavy hand that within an hour, he had one of the defendants, Saddam?s brother-in-law, Barzan al-Tikriti, ejected from the court for complaining about his health care (he has cancer), and then expelled his lawyer as well.

 When the other defence lawyers walked out in sympathy, the chief judge ruled that they would not be allowed back and appointed different lawyers to conduct the defence. And when Saddam rejected those court-appointed lawyers and tried to leave the courtroom, he was first physically restrained by the guards ? and then the judge ordered him to leave. It?s hard to muster any sympathy for the old tyrant, but the courtroom is a zoo.

 Poetic justice

 Former American attorney general, Ramsay Clark, has called the trial ?lawless?. It is now on its third chief judge, the first one having resigned two weeks ago because of official criticism that he was being too meticulous about observing Saddam?s rights, and the second having been fired after a few days when it was revealed that he was an ex-Baathist.

 The new chief judge certainly does not suffer from that problem. In fact, he is a Kurd from Halabja, the very place where Saddam is accused of having killed thousands of people in a poison-gas attack. It?s a bit like having a concentration-camp survivor as chief judge at Nuremberg ? poetic justice, but liable to generate considerable doubts about the fairness and impartiality of the court.

 However, Saddam is not being tried for the atrocity at Halabja, nor for any other crime that the world had heard about before this trial started: the aggression against Iran, for example, or the slaughter of the Shias who responded to George Bush senior?s summons to revolt at the end of the first Gulf war. Those topics are off-limits because they implicate America.

 Hero again

 Instead, he is being tried for the torture and execution of some 146 people whom he suspected of being involved in an assassination attempt against him in the village of Dujail. In theory, he might be tried later on for some of his larger crimes, too, but in practice that won?t happen because the new Iraqi law decrees that all appeals must be completed and a death sentence carried out within thirty days of the accused being found guilty.

 It would have been possible to try Saddam and his companions before an international court, too. In fact, it would have been a lot easier than it was in1945, since there are now many precedents for such a court. But an international court would have had to try Saddam on charges of waging aggressive war and pursuing a policy of genocide, which would have brought up all sorts of awkward history from the days when the US and Saddam Hussein were allies.

 So from Washington?s point of view, Saddam had to be tried in an Iraqi court. Raouf Abdel- Rahman and his fellow judges will find Saddam guilty, and then they will hang him as fast as possible. But the court is accomplishing the improbable feat of turning this monster of a man into a hero and a martyr in the eyes of many people across the Arab world, and even in Iraq itself.

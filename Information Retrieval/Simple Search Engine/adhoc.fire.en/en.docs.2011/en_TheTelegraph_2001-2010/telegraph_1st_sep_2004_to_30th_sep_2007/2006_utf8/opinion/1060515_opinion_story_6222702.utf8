 NEW PLAYERS IN A NEW REGIONAL GAME 

As ?indigenous? voters emerged a stronger force in Assam, 

Sanjib Baruah explains how the Congress?s strategic alliance with Hagrama 

Mohilary paid off

The election results in Assam are not a simple victory 

of a national party, the Congress, over a regional party, the Asom Gana Parishad. 

The ability of the chief minister, Tarun Gogoi, to edge out his regional party 

rival as a more reliable defender of regional interests significantly contributed 

to the Congress victory. Gogoi convinced many ?indigenous? voters ? a euphemistic, 

yet necessary, term for navigating Assam?s politics ? that he may be able to defend 

their interests better than the self-proclaimed regional party. The change of 

the name of the state from Assam to Asom a few weeks before the elections was 

hardly a minor signal. A national party with a regional outlook is how Hiteswar 

Saikia had once described the Assam Congress. For Saikia, that was political rhetoric, 

or at best a political dream. Gogoi has done it through actual political coalition-building.

As many had predicted, the Supreme Court?s invalidation 

of the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunal) Act was a major issue in the 

recent election. The Congress responded by proclaiming the Foreigners (Tribunals 

for Assam) Order of 2006. The Bharatiya Janata Party and the AGP cried foul and 

said that the Congress has brought back the IMDT Act through the backdoor. Large 

segments of the ?minorities?, dissatisfied with the Congress?s inability to defend 

the IMDT Act, betted on perfume mogul Badruddin Azmal?s Assam United Democratic 

Front. Incidentally, the euphemism, ?minority?, has a particular meaning in Assam, 

and its antonym is not ?majority?, but ?indigenous?.

Azmal expected to become kingmaker in the event of 

a hung assembly and hoped to have major influence on any new government. But the 

political appearance of the AUDF ? funded by Azmal?s deep pockets ? scared many 

?indigenous? voters who had traditionally backed the AGP. Azmal?s party won 10 

seats ? pretty much the number he thought would give him that political leverage. 

But since the results have come out, Azmal has been busy more in damage control 

than in influence peddling.

The party that acquired the influence that Azmal had 

fantasized about, and won one more seat than the AUDF, is the faction of the Bodoland 

People?s Progressive Forum led by Hagrama Mohilary. And on the key regional issue 

in post-IMDT Assam ? illegal immigration from Bangladesh ? Mohilary and Azmal 

are in opposite camps.

Mohilary and other Bodo militant leaders today evoke 

more confidence among many ?indigenous? voters on the illegal immigration question 

than the AGP. While Bodo leaders are not vocal participants in the IMDT debate, 

they are trusted not for their words, but because of their track record in Bodo-dominated 

areas.

Hagrama Mohilary is perhaps the single biggest winner 

of this election: a remarkable achievement for a relative newcomer to electoral 

politics. Until about two years ago, he was the leader of the dreaded Bodo Liberation 

Tigers. His organization was disbanded only in December 2003 following an accord 

signed with the Central and state governments. Last year?s elections to the Bodoland 

Territorial Autonomous Council gave Mohilary his first chance to display his style 

of electoral politics. That was when the political partnership between him and 

the state Congress began.

The formation of the BTAC was the result of both the 

BLT?s armed struggle and the overground political mobilization by the All Bodo 

Students? Union. The BPPF includes both camps of the Bodo movement. However, in 

the BTAC elections, Mohilary put up his former BLT colleagues as independent candidates 

against official BPPF candidates. There were violent clashes between Mohilary 

loyalists and ABSU supporters and allegations of vote rigging led to re-poll in 

two constituencies. Mohilary himself won his seat uncontested ? apparently a prestige 

symbol for former militants adjusting to democracy because it proclaims unchallenged 

political dominance.

Unlike the BJP and AGP, the Congress did not put up 

any official candidates in the BTAC elections. It allowed the Congress to remain 

on the best of terms with all factions of the Bodo leadership and wait and see 

before developing an electoral strategy. When the Mohilary-led BTAC was sworn 

in, Tarun Gogoi and three of his ministerial colleagues attended the ceremony, 

but top leaders of the BPPF stayed away. In the assembly elections, the alliance 

between the Mohilary faction and the Congress was quite open. The Congress did 

not put up candidates in five constituencies and asked its supporters to vote 

for BPPF(H) candidates.

While Bodo-specific issues such as additional developmental 

funds for the BTAC area and more powers to the BTAC, are likely to be priorities 

for the BPPF(H), the party also attaches enormous significance to state-wide matters. 

Since the election results, its spokesman, Khampa Borgoyary, has spoken of ?indigenous 

ethnic groups? having a significant say in the running of the state government 

?for the first time since Independence.? This, he says, has been facilitated by 

an attitudinal change of the state Congress leadership. Solving the problem of 

illegal immigration will be a priority for his party because it concerns ?all 

the indigenous people of the state.?

The historic emergence of Bodo leaders as more trusted 

defenders of ?indigenous? interests becomes particularly apparent when their spectacular 

electoral success is contrasted with the defeat of the AGP in almost the entire 

Upper Assam ? a stronghold of AGP-style regionalism.

To be sure, Gogoi himself did not spare any efforts 

to address the concerns of ?minorities? after the court struck down the IMDT law. 

He supported the amendment of the Foreigners Order and criticized statements by 

political opponents and by the state governor about thousands of Bangladeshis 

entering Assam through the porous border. But unlike his political rival, the 

state Congress president, Bhubaneswar Kalita, Gogoi persistently called Azmal?s 

AUDF party ?communal? and showed no interest in an alliance. That gave him high 

marks from ?indigenous? opinion-makers and voters.

The contrast with the AGP could not be more striking. 

Just before the vote-count began, the AGP announced that it would ally with AUDF 

to form a new government. ?Barring the issue of illegal migration from Bangladesh,? 

said party president Brindabon Goswami, ?there is not much of difference between 

the AGP and the AUDF. Both parties have regional aspirations and it will be easier 

to work with them.? 

In coming days, there will be many challenges to the 

brand new political equation that has emerged in Assam. There is already a feeling 

in Congress circles that while the support of the BPPF(H) and a few independents 

may enable the party to form the government, the party cannot afford a further 

erosion of its traditional support among ?minorities?. Thanks to the AUDF?s success, 

the number of ?minority? Congress legislators has come down to eight from thirteen 

in the previous assembly. There is pressure to get the AUDF on board. And not 

surprisingly, the pressure has come from New Delhi as much as from the grassroots. 

It was the Congress observer, Digvijay Singh, who said in Guwahati,?it will be 

only ?thanks? from us if AUDF comes forward to support us.? Ajmal has already 

expressed a desire to meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi. 

The next few days will determine whether the new regional 

attire of the Assam Congress ? the Bodo dokhona rather than the Assamese 

gamosa ? is only a temporary electoral fashion or the sign of a significant 

regionalization of a national party.

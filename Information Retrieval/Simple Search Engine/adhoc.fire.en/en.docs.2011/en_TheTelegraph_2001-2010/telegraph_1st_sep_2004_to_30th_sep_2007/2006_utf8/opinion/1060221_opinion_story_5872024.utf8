 PHILOSOPHER AND TEACHER: PETER STRAWSON 

 A thinker who was relentless in his 

 pursuit of truth and its importance, writes Arindam Chakrabarti 

 in his tribute to Peter Strawson 

 Interview with god 

 Professor Sir Peter Frederick 

 Strawson passed away on February 13, at the age of 86. Kierkegaard 

 was not Strawson?s most favourite philosopher. But Kierkegaard?s 

 chosen epitaph ? ?That individual? ? seems to capture best 

 the spirit of this last great apostle of clearness, distinctness, 

 common sense, and light-footed realism. It is also an apt 

 description of the author of the 20th century philosophical 

 classic: Individuals: An Essay in Descriptive Metaphysics 

 (1959). In a philosophical milieu where ?logical positivists? 

 and ?ordinary language philosophers? in Cambridge and Oxford 

 were trashing ontology as at best bad grammar and at worst 

 gibberish, this work, describing the common basic structure 

 of our thought and talk about the world of objects and persons 

 around us, gently brought back the prodigal sons of linguistic 

 philosophy to their metaphysical home. 

 Strawson started his studiedly 

 quotidian metaphysics by talking about the ineluctability 

 of our reference to substantial particulars in space ? material 

 objects and persons, the subjects of our conversation and 

 empirical judgments. In the last months of his life, he 

 was working on a co-edited volume on controversies regarding 

 the meaning of predicates. Thus his seminal work revolved 

 round the themes of subject and predicate in logic and grammar, 

 which was the title of his smallest, dearest ? and, he felt, 

 unduly neglected ? book.

 A couple of days before he died, 

 he wrote a short light-hearted piece about truth for his 

 grandchild. In his youth, Strawson had twice played a formidable 

 David against such philosophical Goliaths as his own teacher, 

 J.L. Austin, and the towering Bertrand Russell. On the first 

 of these occasions, also, the topic was truth.

 In an Aristotlean Society meeting, 

 Austin had defended the hoary correspondence theory of truth 

 with unmatched cunning and complexity of examples. With 

 a slew of trenchant objections, Strawson argued that that 

 theory needed not to be emended but eliminated. Strawson?s 

 own proposal, influenced by Frank Ramsey, was that ascribing 

 truth to a statement simply amounts to asserting, conceding, 

 granting or endorsing a statement with a ?ditto?. (Here 

 we could reflect on the trivium that the word in Sanskrit 

 for ?Yes, I agree? is ?Om? ? the clich?d name of Gandhi?s 

 god.) The Austin-Strawson debate on truth has since become 

 canonized as part of basic training in philosophy.

 On the second occasion, the target 

 of attack was Russell?s theory of description. That theory, 

 first published in 1905, was designed to clear up two millennia 

 of muddle-headedness starting from Plato. The problem, nicknamed 

 ?Plato?s Beard? by W.V. Quine, was this: what is it that 

 we refer to when we intelligibly use the name or description 

 that stands for an unreal or impossible entity, to say, 

 for example that Pegasus flies or that the square-circle 

 does not exist? Russell showed that ?Pegasus? or ?The square-circle? 

 does not denote or mean anything by itself. Rather it introduces 

 a (false) existence-claim (conjoined with a uniqueness claim) 

 into whatever sentence we construct using it. In order to 

 call such a sentence false, we don?t need to first identify 

 a thing (a nothing?) for the sentence to be false about. 

 Russell would have argued that 

 the sentence, ?The present king of America is a Texan?, 

 is neither true nor meaningless, therefore it must be false, 

 because the subject-phrase introduces a false existence-claim, 

 and because a sentence is either true, or false, or meaningless. 

 In his slow but devastating essay, 

 ?On Referring? (Mind, 1950), Strawson rejected this 

 bogus trichotomy. Sentences can be meaningful or meaningless, 

 but only statements made by the use of sentences can be 

 true or false. Is the graffiti-sentence we may find: ?Aishwarya 

 loves me? true or false? We don?t know what statement is 

 made by it until we know who says it, when, and whom does 

 he refer to by the name. Thus, that America has at least 

 one and at most one king is not part of what is asserted 

 usually by the use of that funny sentence, but a presupposition 

 of that sentence being usable to make any statement at all. 

 Since the presupposition is not true, the statement is neither 

 true nor false, but the sentence remains meaningful.

 When Russell was at the zenith 

 of his fame and the theory of description was taken to be 

 the ?paradigm of philosophy?, a 30 year old Strawson demolished 

 it in one clean stroke, proving it itself to be muddled-headed. 

 ?On Referring? led to a new line of research in logic and 

 linguistics about presuppositions and truth-value gaps. 

 What was the big deal? we may wonder now. Strawson would 

 have responded, quoting Austin here: ?Importance is not 

 important, truth is?.

 When I was working under his supervision 

 on a similar ?unimportant? topic of philosophical logic, 

 I had asked him how I should face the likely objection that 

 the conclusions we draw in analytical philosophy or Navya 

 Nyaya, after such complex argumentation, were trivial. He 

 told me that I should welcome that charge (what in Nyaya 

 is called ?ishtaapatti?) and respond ?I hope it is 

 trivial?.

 Even if Strawson?s theory of truth 

 and reference is regarded as too technical to be of abiding 

 and wide-ranging philosophical interest, his work on causation, 

 perception, actions, universals, the mind-body problem, 

 and the problem of other minds will be remembered as having 

 changed the shape of the field. With subtle yet limpid argumentation 

 against the Cartesian obsession with the first person?s 

 privileged access to her own subjective states, he proved 

 that a mental state cannot be self-ascribed unless it is 

 ascribable to others. About ?my depression?, which often 

 even the non-philosopher imagines to be too private to be 

 knowable by another, he said, ?If only mine, then not mine 

 at all?. We can benefit by meditating on this principle 

 in all sorts of different contexts.

 Out of his ten books, The Bounds 

 of Sense is 20th century?s most widely used English 

 commentary on Kant?s Critique of Pure Reason. Apart 

 from making Kant?s notoriously difficult ideas accessible, 

 this ?commentary? contains some of Strawson?s most delightfully 

 vehement criticisms of Kant. At one point he calls one of 

 Kant?s arguments about the self ?a non-sequitur of numbing 

 grossness?. He also audaciously clips off Kant?s transcendental 

 idealism, as unnecessary revisionary metaphysics!

 Quite independently of his enormous 

 published work, Strawson?s impact on philosophy spread through 

 his untiring teaching at Oxford, first at University College 

 and then at Magdalen College. Paul Snowdon has compared 

 his tutorials to interviews with god. I personally remember 

 those fortnightly 90 minute sessions of his reading my essays, 

 more thoroughly than I could ever read them myself, exposing 

 their errors and bringing out their unsuspected potentials, 

 polishing their grammar and style, and through it all, his 

 entrancing demonstration of how to think for the sake of 

 getting it right, rather than to appear clever.

 Outside of analytic philosophy, 

 and especially in the social sciences, his paper, ?Freedom 

 and Resentment? remains the most widely read and used. In 

 it, Strawson shows that abandoning the reactive attitudes 

 towards each other in favour of a ?cold? scientistic determinism 

 is not an option to us humans who live through personal 

 relationships. It is not enough for us to ?explain? each 

 other?s conscious conduct with Dennett?s dangerous idea 

 or Zizek?s Marxist-Lacanian gaze at the economic-sexual 

 causes and effects. Amidst all our ?cool? philosophies, 

 we must remain human by being attracted or indifferent to 

 or repulsed by other humans. And when we do that, we cannot 

 but ascribe a certain ability to have acted otherwise to 

 those very humans who live and act within the causal realm 

 of animate and inanimate nature. This was Strawson?s nuanced 

 solution to the toughest problem of the metaphysics of morals: 

 the issue of freedom versus determinism.

 Professional philosophers in the 

 world are now divided between the continental types and 

 the analytic types who often shun each other. Strawson?s 

 greatness lies in the fact that like his philosophical heroes 

 Aristotle and Kant, his profound influence straddles both 

 camps. Contemporary analytic stars like John Searle, Hilary 

 Putnam, and John McDowell confess to deriving their content 

 and method of thinking from Strawson. Such continental philosophical 

 giants as Jurgen Habermas and Paul Ricoeur explicitly built 

 their theories of communicative acts and the moral phenomenology 

 of othering the self on foundations laid by Strawson.

 At the Boston World Congress of 

 Philosophy in 1998, Donald Davidson, W.V. Quine, P.F. Strawson 

 and a couple of other living greats were honoured for their 

 lifetime contribution to philosophy. Someone from the audience 

 asked an obvious question to this exclusively white galaxy 

 of great minds ?Have any of you ever made a serious study 

 of or been influenced by any non-Western philosophy?? The 

 deafening silence in response was broken by Peter Strawson?s 

 modest confession: ?I have been exposed to Indian philosophy, 

 regrettably late in my life, and some of it, especially 

 the ideas of the Nyaya school of thought has influenced 

 my metaphysics?. When the greatest living Oxford philosopher 

 (and a successor of Gilbert Ryle who had publicly said that 

 nothing worth a philosopher?s notice arose out of the East 

 except the sun) confessed to this incriminating cognitive 

 contagion from the East, he was not showing off his cosmopolitanism, 

 he was fearlessly speaking unadorned truth.

 Of all the English speaking philosophers 

 who were hosted and celebrated in India in the 20th century, 

 Strawson was the only one who truly, deeply, and honestly 

 interacted with the philosophers in this country and loved 

 always to come back (Once he playfully described himself 

 as an ?Indiaddict?) Apart from the late Pranab Kumar Sen 

 and Rooprekha Verma, who were his close friends and edited 

 a wonderful collection of essays on his philosophy with 

 his ?replies?, he was particularly fond of Ramchandra Gandhi 

 whose doctoral dissertation on the presuppositions of human 

 communication he had supervised. Gandhi?s metaphysical views 

 have moved far apart from his teacher?s, but his brilliant 

 and powerful idea of taking addressing rather than referring 

 to another human being as the more fundamental speech-act 

 bears the stamp of a frontal attack on his own stand-point 

 that Strawson, typically, would have nurtured in his research 

 student.

 Towards death we are not supposed 

 to take a reactive stance, for death is not a person or 

 a voluntary act, unless it is a killing. Natural death just 

 happens in the causal order of things (Wittgenstein decreed 

 that it is not even an event in life). No one does it, hence 

 no one can resent it. Yet, perhaps testing the limits of 

 my rational adherence to unintelligent design, I cannot 

 help claiming a certain freedom to resent the death of such 

 an irreplaceable teacher, such a dazzlingly sharp and incredibly 

 honest philosopher, such a kind man.

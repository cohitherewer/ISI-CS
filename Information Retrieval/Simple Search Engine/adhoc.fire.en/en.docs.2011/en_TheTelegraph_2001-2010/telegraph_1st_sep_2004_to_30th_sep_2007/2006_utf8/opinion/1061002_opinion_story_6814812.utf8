 NUTRITION IN A NUCLEAR AGE

 DOCUMENT

 Excerpts from the International Atomic Energy Agencys Nuclear Technology Review 2006

 The success of the application of previously adopted international standards related to the use of ionizing radiation, now used by over 50 countries worldwide, for the control of food-borne pathogens and insect pests is reflected in part by the recent enactment of harmonized regulations in five more countries for various types of food.

 Other activities related to the application of international standards for consumer protection and the facilitation of agricultural trade include an online database of government first actions in response to a nuclear emergency affecting agriculture. 

 International trade from affected regions will also be enhanced through collaborative efforts in the revision and expansion to cover additional isotopes of the Codex Guideline Levels for Radionuclides in Foods Following Accidental Nuclear Contamination for Use in International Trade, and for a period greater than one year following a nuclear accident or radiological event.

 Stable isotope techniques have in the past been used as nutritional research tools but are now also used for developing and evaluating nutrition programmes. The techniques can be applied in the most vulnerable population groups...because only stable isotopes are used. 

 The sensitivity and specificity of measurements, as compared to conventional techniques, are increased by use of stable isotopes. For example, a better understanding can be achieved of the efficacy of nutrition interventions based on changes in body composition measured by stable isotope techniques. Such techniques can address the need to evaluate locally appropriate, sustainable food based strategies on nutritional status in people living with HIV/AIDS and emphasize the importance of integrating nutrition into a comprehensive response...as recently highlighted by the WHO. 

 Positron emission tomography imaging is now a dominant topic of most medical imaging meetings, and there has been a remarkable increase in PET publications. This technique, using ultra short-lived radio isotopes attached to biological markers, allows nuclear medicine physicians to track organ function at the molecular level. In particular, with the use of radiolabelled glucose...or C11-choline, organs can be explored with respect to glucose and amino acid metabolism. PET images fused with X-ray computed tomography images provide intricate detail and true quantitative health changes in individual patients, thus leading to changes in the way in which disease is managed.

 Within the past few decades, advances in computer speed have fostered a revolution in medical imaging technology. Within the next decade it is expected that most modern radiology departments will acquire flat panel imagers, thereby becoming filmless and completing the transition to digital technology. 

 The abandonment of chemical processing of film is cost-effective, leading to substantial improvements in image quality and reliability, and has the potential to lead to an overall reduction in exposure to patients from diagnostic X-rays. These advances provide the basis for an electronic medical recording system... reflecting the impact that the technique has on imaging of cancer and other diseases.

 Experience the magic 

 In CONCEPTS OF SPACE IN TRADITIONAL INDIAN ARCHITECTURE 

 (Mapin, $35), Yatin Pandya rubbishes the cut-and-dried 

 way historians, archaeologists and anthropologists look 

 at ancient Indian constructions and suggests we try and 

 understand the correlation between ?spatial attributes and 

 human behaviour?. Buildings, he believes, emote purely at 

 a ?human plane, making unnecessary any cultural conditioning 

 or prior knowledge of the context.? And yet he goes on to 

 provide the historical context, detailed plans and their 

 analysis of the four structures he selects for study ? the 

 Rudabai Stepwell at Adalaj (both pictures), the Kailash 

 temple at Ellora, the Sun temple of Modhera and the Sarkhej 

 Rauza in Ahmedabad. Pandya also explores contemporary local 

 and domestic spaces. What rankles is his attempt to separate 

 history and tradition.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 IDES OF DECEMBER

 One womans failure is another mans success. Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has a chance now to do a dance on the political grave of Ms Mamata Banerjee. But this will depend on how determined he is to shape a new West Bengal that is infused by a work culture. Fridays bandh called at the behest of Ms Banerjee was a flop. This is not to suggest that Calcutta and the rest of West Bengal functioned as on a normal working day. Rather it is to point to the fact that compared to previous bandhs, there was much more activity in the city and in the state. There was the fear of violence. Despite this, a larger number of people came out to pursue their normal activities. One reason for the relative failure of the bandh was the heightened activity of the state. It would not be incorrect to assume that Mr Bhattacharjee was personally responsible for ensuring that buses plied and that mini buses, taxis and auto-rickshaws came out of their garages. The availability of transport gave people the sense of security to come out of their homes to attend to their jobs. A bandh-weary people voted with their feet. Mr Bhattacharjee, unlike Ms Banerjee, rightly read the mood of the people and took the necessary steps to foil the bandh.

 The foiling of one bandh does not a work culture make. Mr Bhattacharjee cannot be unaware of this. It is also easy to take steps against a bandh called by a political rival. Mr Bhattacharjees real test lies a fortnight away. On December 14, there is the call of an all-India industrial strike. The Centre of Indian Trade Unions is the prime mover of this strike. On similar occasions in the past, an industrial strike has become, in left-ruled West Bengal, a bandh when everything in the state has come to a standstill. The principal reason for this had been the state governments tacit support to the strike call. In the past, the Left Front government has refused to make transport available and this has transformed an industrial strike into a bandh. Mr Bhattacharjees government can no longer take this position. It cannot argue, somewhat disingenuously, that a bandh call by Ms Banerjee and a strike call by Citu should be treated differently. Both disrupt normal life, both devastate work culture and both tarnish the image of West Bengal. Mr Bhattacharjee has taken it upon himself to tell the world that the common impression of West Bengal as being inimical to work, capital and enterprise is not true. On December 14, he will have to walk the talk.

 Mr Bhattacharjee has to prepare from now to implement the necessary steps to ensure normalcy on December 14. It is not enough to say that only the IT sector is outside the purview of bandhs. People in West Bengal must be given the choice of going about their business without hassle and fear. One important way of ensuring this is to make transport available on December 14, as it was done on December 1. A fortnight is a long time in politics. It is a very long time in the making and unmaking of a successful chief minister.

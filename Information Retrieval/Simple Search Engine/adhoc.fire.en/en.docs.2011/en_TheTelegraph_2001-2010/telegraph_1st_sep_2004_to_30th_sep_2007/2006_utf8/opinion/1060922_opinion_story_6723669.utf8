FAILED STATES: THE ABUSE OF POWER AND THE ASSAULT ON 

DEMOCRACY By Noam Chomsky Hamish Hamilton, 11.99

[Douglas Giles] used to teach a class on 

world religions at Roosevelt University, Chicago.Last year, Giles was ordered 

by his head of departmentnot to allow students to ask questions about Palestine 

and Israel.Students, being what they are, did not go along with the ban. A young 

woman, originally from Pakistan, asked a question about Palestinian rights. Someone 

complained and professor Giles was promptly fired.

 Henry Porter, The Observer, August 13, 2006

In the Eighties, the Reagan administration had concocted 

the category of the terrorist state. A decade later, Bill Clinton came up with 

the concept of the rogue state. More recent is the notion of the failed state 

that posed a security threat to the United States of America or called for US 

intervention to save it from itself. But Noam Chomsky argues that all three categories 

are hard to sustain since, even under a rather conservative reading of US law, 

the US itself best fits the bill.

However, the contention that America is the number 

one rogue state is trite and overworked. What the US has increasingly begun to 

exhibit, in fact, are the characteristics of the failed state itself its record 

of denying democracy abroad and its ever-tightening leash on democracy at home. 

Failed States studies the damage done to the world and to the institution 

of American democracy by successive presidential regimes in the US, especially 

the George W. Bush regime. 

In his preface, Chomsky offers a tentative definition 

of failed states as those that are unable or unwilling to protect their citizens 

from violence, and perhaps even destruction. They also tend to regard themselves 

as beyond the reach of domestic or international law. This myopia gives them 

the licence for aggressive conduct abroad while, at home, whatever democratic 

institutions they have are devoid of any real substance. As evidence, Chomsky 

brings not just the Bush II years but the whole history of American intervention 

abroad, particularly in South America. 

The Bush Doctrine of perpetual hegemony unilateral 

intervention to assure military dominance and uninterrupted access to vital resources 

 is traced from the Clinton Doctrine all the way back to J.Q. Adams and the acquisition 

of Florida in the first Seminole war of 1818. The Bush team has intensified and 

extended the Clinton Doctrine in every sphere. For instance, Clintons idea of 

control of space for military purposes has been transformed into ownership 

meant to allow instant engagement anywhere in the world.

Yet, Bush amp; Co. is not a bunch of trigger-happy 

cowboys running amok. Chomsky repeatedly asserts that they are only pretending 

to be irrational but, in fact, know exactly what they want and that is absolute 

domination, as long as the going is good. If the War on Terror is really about 

terror, why did the Senate sharply reduce funds for mass transit security just 

before the London bombings of July 2005? Perhaps, the Bush regime would not really 

like to see terror go. 

Scholars have questioned the viability of the US political 

system if it does not face threats to survival resulting from current policies 

 so that it can play crusader abroad and divert attention from unpopular socio-economic 

policies at home. Instead of exploiting Muslim opposition to al Qaida, the Bush 

administration did precisely what bin Laden had hoped it would do. The result 

was the diffusion of jihadis around the globe and the quagmire of Iraq.

A leadership radically dedicated to the short-term 

interests of its powerful and wealthy elite, and to global dominance, adopts the 

natural device of demonic messianism. The rhetoric extolling democracy and Americas 

sacrifices to promote it abroad is nothing new. It is rooted in the Wests erstwhile 

civilizing mission in the colonies. Only the USs track record is a consistent 

opposition to genuinely popular and democratic regimes such as that of Salvador 

Allende in Chile and support for the likes of the Somoza regime in Nicaragua or 

its blinkered attitude to Arab-Israeli issues. What America fears is genuine democracy 

that would empower the people who would then exercize their franchise to reject 

the US and/or their poodling governments. Thus the coalition played every card 

to delay elections in Iraq. Democratic identity for a nation is the subjugation 

of its interests and its publics wishes to US ones. Hence, Turkey was asked to 

prove its democratic credentials by rejecting the opinion of its citizens and 

joining the war against Iraq. 

Abuse of power abroad is closely linked to the assault 

on democracy at home. The US, today, has one of the most gagged or collaborative 

presses in the world. Public opinion is intensively monitored and, apart from 

Bushs spying on citizens, websites such as frontpagemag.com and campus-watch.org 

regularly cite Noam Chomsky and other distinguished intellectuals in their lists 

of the most dangerous academics in America. 

Douglas Giles is just one member of a growing community 

being deprived of its fundamental right of freedom of speech and conscience. Meanwhile, 

real wages for the majority of middle and working-class Americans have stagnated 

or declined and are now almost the lowest in industrial societies. Simultaneously, 

there has been a steady erasure of the welfare system while the hungry in the 

US rose to over 38 million in 2004. This disenfranchised public is kept in line 

by the resort to a pseudoreligious transfiguration harping on Christian and 

family values and opposing significant scientific research at the same time that 

the government cries imminent destruction by enemies. Chomsky reiterates that 

a basic feature of the democratic deficit in the failed state is the ignoring 

of public opinion. Persistent academic studies and surveys say that the majority 

of Americans want the US to abide by international law, sign the Kyoto Protocol, 

allow the United Nations to lead in international crises, and use diplomacy and 

economics instead of force as much as possible. It goes without saying that US 

public policy does not reflect this popular mood at all. 

However, this line of argument also exposes Chomskys 

flawed logic if the media does not speak the truth, if the state has successfully 

hoodwinked the people for so long, then how did the majority come to hold the 

correct position on so many issues? Admitting that he is, on the whole, right, 

one still feels that a less articulate and a less rhetorical Chomsky, one that 

did not fail to mention the Marshall Plan, would have sounded more convincing.

In comparison to the rest of the Chomsky corpus, Failed 

States is a disappointment of sorts. The book is hurriedly written and basically 

an extension of Hegemony or Survival (2003). Although it takes a bout of 

verbal diarrhoea to counter Chomskys blitzkrieg of facts piled upon facts and 

his relentless portrayal of a nightmare, one feels tempted to ask whether Americas 

present plight is indeed reminiscent of the German descent from civilization to 

Nazi barbarism.

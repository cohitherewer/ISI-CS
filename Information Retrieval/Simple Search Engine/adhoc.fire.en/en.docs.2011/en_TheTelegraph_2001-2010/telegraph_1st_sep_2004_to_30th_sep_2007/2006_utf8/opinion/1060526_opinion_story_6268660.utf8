 SMALL AND PROUD

 In 1999, the British prime minister, Mr Tony Blair, had announced, ?Kosovo is on the doorstep of Europe?. This week he could have said the same thing about Montenegro, one of the original six federal republics that had made up Yugoslavia, which voted to break away from Serbia. The relationship between the small mountainous nation of Montenegro and its dominant neighbour Serbia had always been fraught with tension. From 1997, the prime minister of Montenegro, Mr Milo Djukanovic, had initiated the process of distancing his country from Serbia and to regain the independence the country enjoyed previous to the Paris Peace Conference that marked the end of the First World War. Montenegro was jubilant that it was independent but what is significant, and may even be a trifle disconcerting for Mr Djukanovic, is that the independence was achieved by a very slender majority. According to the rules agreed upon prior to the elections between the government and the European Union, 55 per cent of the voters had to vote in favour to achieve independence. Results showed that in an election that had seen a turnout of 86 per cent, 55.4 per cent votes went in favour of breaking away from Serbia. The celebrations were thus laced with some amount of sadness.

 The independence of Montenegro is perhaps the last nail in the coffin of the state of Yugoslavia, which was created after the First World War. Yugoslavia was thus a quintessentially 20th-century entity. It was cobbled together at the beginning of the century and disintegrated as the century was coming to an end. The disintegration witnessed a long and cruel ethnic conflict. Even today, Montenegro has large Serb and Albanian minorities and these cannot be comfortable with the upsurge of nationalism that now grips Montenegro. In the late 19th century, Montenegro had no public clocks. But time and Europe seem to have caught up with the tiny country.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 LONELY IMPULSE OF DELIGHT

 Excellence is immaterial when it is a woman who excels. This sounds harsh in an age aspiring to, and almost achieving, equal opportunities in some spheres, but the truth is harsh sometimes. It is even more disconcerting to find the comment true of a sphere in which the entry of women has been perceived as a kind of victory, symbolic of a breakdown in conventional ideas of women?s skills, ambitions and place in the professional world. Women in India cannot fly fighter planes. The best women trainees are allowed to fly only transporters and helicopters. Men are selected, according to performance, to fly these as well as combat aircraft. The policy is blatant in its discrimination; its makers are evidently more attuned to old-fashioned cultural prejudices ? against women as fighters? ? than attentive to competitive performance records.

 Women have been wanting to fly ? and not just metaphorically ? since there was a vehicle to fly in. The first woman pilot, Blanche Scott, took off in the plane she was allowed just to taxi in 1910. At no point was the entry into aviation easy for women anywhere in the world. In this, as in many other professions, women had to prove themselves more competent than men before they would be considered at least equally capable. Flying and freedom are irresistibly associated in the human mind, and both ideas, together and separately, clash with the impulse to control and confine. For the West, with its long history of splendid women in the sky, this conflict is now far in the past. But even there, the female fighter pilot was a concept difficult to acknowledge. The organization called the Women?s Airforce Service Pilots, better known as WASP, made new history for women in military aviation during World War II. But it was not recognized formally as a military organization till 1977. Yet many women were already part of military service at the time, as ferry and test pilots, mechanics, flight controllers and instructors.

 Having allowed women to enter the force 15 years ago, India is still hesitant to give them a fighter?s power. There are only 700 women in the 1.1 lakh strong force, and even among them, merit is obviously not a deciding factor in allotting roles. The ratio of women to men in the force is an unmistakable indicator of cultural barriers, through which the achievement of Kalpana Chawla had burst through like a new dream. The custom barring women from the cockpits of fighter planes exposes a self-contradiction at the base of the policy to admit them into the force at all. If the idea is to make maximum use of India?s magnificent human resources, it is absurd to stop the best from doing their best. Women are showing the way by breaking through inhibitions to fly and fight; the best thing the administration can do is follow their lead.

 CHICKENS AGAIN

 It is now time for India to be menaced by chickens. With more than 30,000 poultry dying of the avian influenza in northern Maharashtra, it has become crucial to work out the right combination of prompt action, keeping the public properly informed and preventing undue panic. So far, only birds have died of the ?flu, and the designated infected and surveillance zones are of manageable size, although the neighbouring states of Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat have to immediately get their short- and long-term acts ready. There is always a risk of the birds infecting people, and ultimately ? most dangerously ? of the virus mutating within human beings to produce a human pathogen that might be passed on from person to person without the mediation of birds. That way lies the possibility of a pandemic, like the one in 1918, which took around 40 million lives all over the world.

 Prompt culling of poultry within the designated zones is crucial now, without stopping to think of the financial losses incurred because of this. But careful and sustained observation, together with proper testing of a large sample of dead birds, is also important. It is important to establish beyond doubt that the killer flu is the avian one, since already there are rumours that the outbreak, or the news of it, was commercially motivated. But whatever the truth, it will have to be faced and communicated to the public accurately and accessibly. Laboratories and government departments, state as well as Central, will have to be efficient and scrupulous about this. What China did with information regarding SARS, or Indonesia and Thailand with their outbreaks of bird ?flu, should not be repeated in India. Keeping stocks of medicines ready, and marshalling resources and political will for a vaccine should also be top priority at a longer-term level. In a country where human beings, most of them very poor, often share living space with poultry and farm or domestic animals, habits of carefulness and observation will also have to be inculcated. Farmers must be encouraged to change their habits of raising poultry, and to stop living in the same space as their poultry, which is not going to be an easy task in India. In the cities, full of unsupervised and unhygienic food-producing units, where uncooked meat, eggs and foods that are eaten raw are unthinkingly brought into contact with one another, proper standards of safety and cleanliness will have to be introduced and maintained.

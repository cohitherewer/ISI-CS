The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 FIRST PRINCIPLES

 The Bharatiya Janata Party treated its arrival on Raisina Hill as an occasion for a party; for the first five years in power, it splurged on programmes proper and improper. Then its conscience twitched. It wanted to become virtuous but not too fast. So it passed the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, which required the government to abolish its primary deficit in five years. That would have been by next year. The United Progressive Alliance government thought it unfair that its predecessor should have had a ball and it should have to pay the bill. So it has been putting off the deadline, which now stands at 2009 when this government should be demitting office. But maybe the Congress has developed hope of returning to power; or it has been slow in realizing the pleasures of fiscal irresponsibility. Voices are being heard in favour of putting off the deadline even further. The Planning Commission, in its approach paper, has proposed a plan so huge that its adoption would entail the scrapping of the FRBM deadline. But of course, all that is being suggested is that it be further postponed.

 Politicians should have no difficulty in agreeing to spend more; and in case they have, the Planning Commission has provided sanctimonious heads for expenditure which should salve their conscience employment, social justice, infrastructure, and so on. But surprisingly, there is someone whose conscience is not so salved the finance minister. He has put off the FRBM deadline once, but this time he is balking. And he has received support from an unlikely player the Reserve Bank of India. That is a surprise since Mr P. Chidambaram and Mr Y.V. Reddy have not often seen eye to eye. But the real surprise lies in the opposition, which comes from the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, and his deputy chairman, Mr Montek Singh Ahluwalia. When they ran the finance ministry a decade ago, they placed great stress on fiscal correction. Now their objective has changed with their interests they now belong to the spenders. But being good economists, they have cobbled together a plausible argument that a higher fiscal stimulus is affordable since inflation is no longer high.

 A single bad cause does not convert good economists into bad. The finance minister should try putting it to his antagonists that the point of fiscal responsibility is not simply good governance and prudence, but reestablishment of a fiscal principle, that current revenue must cover at least current expenditure, and that if the government borrows, the money it so raises should be spent on heads that would bring a return at least equal to the interest cost. It is not enough for the government to spend on infrastructure; it must do so productively, efficiently and responsibly.

 A FEW GOOD JOURNEYMEN

 Travels to Europe: Self and Other in Bengali Travel Narratives (1870-1910) By Simonti Sen, Orient Longman, Rs 490

 Not always can one explain the cultural transaction between the colonized and the colonizer in terms of ?the loss and the recovery of self [of the colonized] under colonial rule? (Ashis Nandy). Very often this is a matter of rejection while intending to accept, and acceptance while pretending to reject. The process of otherization which, conversely, forms the basis of the construction of selfhood, involves a moral framework which varies with the change of the historical contexts. The nationalist ?self? remains largely an amorphous concept, almost always ?in the making? and challenged from within.

 Simonti Sen examines this process as embodied in the writings of some Bengali travellers who ventured into Europe in the period 1870-1910. Travel, Sen indicates, has to be understood as a metaphor, epitomizing an expedition into a domain (Europe here) which represented not merely a geographical terrain but a cultural trope and conceptual praxis to the colonized mind. Sen, taking her cue from authors like Stephen Greenblatt and James Clifford, demonstrates what in anthropology is known as ?spatial practice? ? implying that every space is ?discursively mapped and corporeally practised?, instead of simply existing there as a given.

 Sen?s rationale for choosing the period between 1870 and 1910 is that 1869 is the year when Suez Canal was opened to ?facilitate the journey to Europe? while 1910 is roughly the time when the turmoil in global politics leading to World War I significantly altered the Indian perception of Europe.

 Sen initially focusses on some pre-colonial Persian travellers like Mirza Sheikh Intesamuddin, Mirza Abu Taleb Khan and Yanagawa Masakiyo, a Japanese, showing how their accounts are suffused with a sense of wonder at Europe?s grandeur and all its trappings of modern technology. The writings of 19th-century Bengali travellers like Trailokyanath Mukherjee, Romesh Chandra Dutt, Girish Chandra Basu, Shibnath Shastri, Rabindranath Tagore, Krisnabhabini Das et al shows that a different sense of historicity with a reworked binary of ?self? and ?other? inform their writings. Sen contends that these narratives come through as more introspective, detached, assertive and judgmental than the pre-colonial travelogues.

 One limitation of Sen?s interestingly insightful work is, by her own admission, her total engagement with the liberal-intellectual bhadralok travellers. An alternative perspective from the margin thus sadly remains beyond the purview of Sen?s study. Sen is also not quite mindful of the frequent indeterminacy and ambiguity informing several competing-cum-conflicting models of ?self?, which littered nationalist discourses in the 19th century.

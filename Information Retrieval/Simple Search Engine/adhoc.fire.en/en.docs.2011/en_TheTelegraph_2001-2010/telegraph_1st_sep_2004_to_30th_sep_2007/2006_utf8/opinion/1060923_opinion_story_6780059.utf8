The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 TWIGGYS GIRLS

 The message must be clear Twiggy is as bad for health as tobacco. If it is a public health responsibility to persuade young people not to smoke, then should girls be protected as well from the perils of waifdom? The Madrid local government had banned underweight female models from the catwalk during the citys fashion week recently. Indias health minister has endorsed this decision, since the country is facing an acute problem of osteoporosis among women, which could be a direct result of inordinate, fashion-driven dieting. Some girls schools in Calcutta have even begun monitoring the diet of their students, arranging for family-based counselling against eating disorders, especially anorexia. In India, modish skinniness coexists with a curious absence of misgivings about being overweight. There is an indigenous tradition of reading obesity as health, prosperous felicity and successful parental care. The Indian application of the Madrid principle has been complicated by a recent global study, which announces that Indian women have the highest abdominal obesity the biggest bellies in the world.

 Most parents and teachers would have noticed and this has been confirmed by paediatric research that discontentment with body weight and shape in girls is often strongly related to the frequency of reading fashion magazines. This, in turn, is positively associated with having dieted to lose weight. Regulating the repertory of public images that has a direct impact on such attitudes and perceptions from adolescence into adulthood might, therefore, seem to make sense. But the problem lies deeper. Feelings about the body are intimately and complicatedly tied up with self-esteem, which is both a privately experienced and publicly determined thing. Indian girls, who go on to become women, from the sort of social classes familiar with fashion shows, are perhaps caught between two image-systems with two different kinds of effect on attitudes to weight and shape. On the one hand, there is the globalized image of successful female professionalism. Here slimness, or fitness, is a measure of self-management and achievement. Such a woman would be picking at steamed fish with a fork in a pin-striped suit on a rooftop restaurant, laptop and boyfriend visible but out of focus. On the other hand, there is the body of the wife, daughter-in-law and mother, who like Madhuri Dixit did it and got it all, and then had the good sense to move on to higher, and larger, fulfilments and fecundities.

 Between professionalism and motherhood, modernity and tradition, achievement and destiny, how would self-esteem, and therefore happiness or unhappiness, be constructed for the upwardly mobile or affluent, urban Indian woman? And what would each choice of life ask of her body? How would she feed, clothe and carry it in the world? How would the world look at it then? And how would she look out at the world from inside this body? Making oneself thin or fat by eating too little or too much is surely tied up, often in an obscure and difficult way, with all these questions. Life is scarier than the catwalk.

 Difficult to heal

 Sir ? How can a Union minister, even if he happens to be in charge of the health ministry, get involved with minor administrative affairs of an autonomous institution like the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, slyly ordering the transfer of officials while the director is on leave? The prime minister should have intervened in the matter and stopped Anbumani Ramadoss from antagonizing the medical community. What the minister has said --- including telling the AIIMS director to go ahead and quit --- only betrays his callous disregard for institutional autonomy. A noted heart surgeon like P. Venugopal does not have to go out of AIIMS humiliated by the minister and his babus. Ramadoss deserves to be stripped of his portfolio. It is a tough call, but the prime minister must prove himself up to it.

 Yours faithfully,

J.S. Acharya, Hyderabad

 Sir ? The recent fracas between the director of the AIIMS and the Union health minister had hardly anything new about it. Such spats have been quite common, no matter which dispensation is at the Centre (?At AIIMS, an age ailment?, June 18). It is true that P. Venugopal was the chosen candidate of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government, but at least he was a capable professional. There have been scores of cases where thoroughly incompetent persons have got positions of power, thanks to their proximity to politicians and bureaucrats.

 Yours faithfully,

N.N. Hazra, Calcutta

 Sir ? Despite his noble aim of trying to revive the image of AIIMS and provide people with better treatment, Anbumani Ramadoss?s interference in the administrative affairs of the institute has shown exactly what ails the AIIMS. The answer, of course, is unwanted political interference. With an intake of just 50 students every year, AIIMS is hardly able to meet the growing demands of the health sector ? both in terms of research and production of doctors. Being a doctor himself, the health minister should have used his powers to increase the number of seats in AIIMS, giving respect to its autonomy rather than politicizing matters.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? No doubt Anbumani Ramadoss?s meddling in the running of AIIMS is unacceptable, but the real reason for unhappiness in the medical fraternity is different. Doctors are angry with the Union health minister for denying them pay for the days they were on strike. Someone should tell these doctors, who are proud to be in ?elite? institutions, that strike means no pay. While abdicating their duties as public servants, they had claimed that sacrifices are needed for great causes. While patients were asked, and forced to make sacrifices then, now they too expect these doctors to make their share of sacrifice. There cannot be double standards in the same struggle.

 Yours faithfully,

N. Pranav Sachdeva, New Delhi

 Sir ? The spat between the Central health minister and the AIIMS director, P. Venugopal, is utterly ridiculous (?Lash and push for AIIMS director?, June 1). There is no doubt that Anbumani Ramadoss?s hostility towards Venugopal has more to do with grubby politics of the Indian kind than the real problems with healthcare at the institute. But the support for Venugopal by one group of AIIMS doctors and opposition by another, clearly points to the revolting influence that political parties have over doctors and medical students of one of the premier medical centres in the country. Apparently, Venugopal was sympathetic towards the recent protest by AIIMS students and junior doctors against the government?s proposed reservations policy. Little wonder then that Venugopal is not Ramadoss?s favourite. 

 It is ironic that while the junior doctors and students thought that the AIIMS director has been doing a wonderful job, other faculty members believed that the institute was deteriorating since 2003 because of his poor performance. Obviously, both of these groups cannot be correct. Everyone knows politicians are unscrupulous, but it is shocking to learn that physicians of a leading medical institute are no better. The leading positions in government hospitals are decided not on the quality of the physicians, but on their connection with the political leaders in the ruling government. It is no surprise that the Supreme Court has recently dubbed the Medical Council of India as a ?den of corruption? and removed its president on charges of money-laundering. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kunal Saha, Columbus, US

 Sir ? The AIIMS has been able to serve the people well simply because it has managed to thwart attempts of government interference. The tussle between the health minister and the director of AIIMS is nothing more elevated than an ego-clash. P. Venugopal, however, has shown the courage to stand up to the minister and side with the agitated doctors who were going to lose their salary for the 17 days that they were on strike. Just as it was the people who suffered during the strike, again, it will be helpless patients who will bear the brunt of the war of attrition between a minister and a hospital director.

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

 Blood loss

 Sir ? The report, ?Elections take toll of blood bank stocks? (June 7), is a pointer to the lack of adequate infrastructure jeopardizing one of the most essential services in the public domain. There is no proper system of collecting blood in the state. As a result, the blood banks have no other option but to depend on NGOs or local clubs to organize donation camps. But these organizations hardly get any support from the state government in their endeavour. The fact that the blood banks have run dry during the elections in the state is a sad reminder of the callousness of those who wield power. The politicians and ministers mouth promises about helping the electorate but cannot even ensure them basic services. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Surajit Das, Calcutta

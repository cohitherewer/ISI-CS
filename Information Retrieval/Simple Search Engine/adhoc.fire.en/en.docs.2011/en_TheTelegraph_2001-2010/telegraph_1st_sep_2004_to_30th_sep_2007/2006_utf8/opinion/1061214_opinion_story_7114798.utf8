 Whose development?

 Sir Abhirup Sarkar in Development versus displacement (Dec 7) has rightly stated that the real problem in the Singur small car project pertains to the people losing their land. Adequate compensation should solve this problem. As far as the project is concerned, it is expected to generate a large concomitant employment potential, both direct and indirect, which would also benefit the state enormously. To progress from primitive agricultural economy to industrial economy is a natural human aspiration. The policy-makers should try to make the transition as trouble-free as possible. 

 Yours faithfully,

Ashok Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir It is important to note, as Abhirup Sarkar points out, that the government has been vague about the compensation that is to be given to the farmers in Singur. Before embarking on industrialization, a lot of groundwork should have been covered. The overall literacy rate in West Bengal is not significant and farmers, in particular, are not educated enough to take up alternate professions. In order to ensure the livelihood of the poor farmers who did not give away land willingly, the government must provide them with adequate compensation. 

 Yours faithfully,

Hara Lal Chakraborty, Calcutta 

 Sir Once the acres of agricultural land marked out for the Tatas are given to them, several thousands of acres more are bound to be lost in the process of furthering industrialization. One hopes that the government would give priority to making agro-products available to the public at a reasonable price rather than selling them affordable cars, which would only increase pollution and urban congestion. 

 Yours faithfully,

Gomathy Selvaraj, Calcutta

 Sir The protests in Singur over the Tata Motors project are quite understandable. Very often farmland is acquired forcibly for industrial projects and the compensation paid to farmers is a pittance. The only solution in this case is to follow the Magarpatta city model, where the farmers themselves are stakeholders in the project. The farmers in Magarpatta, Maharashtra, pooled their land together and set up an IT park on that land. This proved financially prosperous. The government and corporate bodies should, therefore, make the farmers stakeholders in the project to be developed on their land. This is the best way to contain dissent among the people of Singur whose land is being used for the small car project. Corporate houses must also go the extra mile and help improve the quality of life in the villages in which they are setting up their plants. Hinjewadi near Pune continues to be a poor village although the IT park it houses generates huge profits. Had the villagers been made stakeholders in the project, Hinjewadi would have been one of the most prosperous villages in Maharashtra. 

 Yours faithfully,

Derek Saldanha, Pune 

 Sir Abhirup Sarkar has presented the pros and cons of the Singur small car project lucidly. The fact that Tata Motors has chosen West Bengal for its small car project is certainly of great financial significance for the state. But should this economic development come at the cost of the sole source of livelihood of hundreds of farmers? These farmers do not even have the educational qualification to find themselves other jobs. Who would be accountable if the promised compensation does not reach these people? What if the amount that reaches them is insufficient to keep their home fires burning? If industrialization is the only way in which a developing state can transform itself into a developed one, then its government should adopt more definitive measures to ensure that the lives and livelihoods of its poor are protected. This must be done not just in terms of giving them financial help, but also by giving them jobs and thereby, security for their future. 

 Yours faithfully,

Oeendri Biswas, Kharagpur

 Sir The brute force employed by the Left Front government in acquiring agricultural land in Singur for the small car project of the Tatas goes against all democratic norms. The left leaders have forfeited their moral right to condemn Mamata Banerjees fast as undemocratic (Fast politics, Dec 10). Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee appears a pitiful figure before the unionized government employees, his corrupt police force, his inept bureaucracy, his disenchanted front partners and his contradicting cabinet colleagues. If Banerjee has now adopted a so-called undemocratic mode of protest after failing to lead a democratic one against Bhattacharjees vision of industrialization, and the brutal methods adopted to implement it, then she has good reasons for doing so.

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir If violence has only one antidote: counter-violence (No velvet glove, Dec 5), then all the wars and riots ravaging the world would be justified instantly. And all the valorization of the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi would mean nothing. Branding the protesters at Singur as outsiders is an easy ploy to defend the police violence. And if the police were right in suppressing the Maoists at Singur, then so were the Naxalites who vandalized a Tata Motors showroom in Calcutta. After all, they were answering violence with more violence.

 Yours faithfully,

Sugoto Pal, Calcutta 

 Sir It is true that violence begets violence. Those who resort to destruction to make their point are enemies of democracy and should be put down ruthlessly. The police did their duty in suppressing the Maoists at Singur. If the police had been softer, then the Maoists would have stalled work at Singur, not for the villagers benefit but for their own. 

 Yours faithfully,

Tarakdas Majumdar, Calcutta

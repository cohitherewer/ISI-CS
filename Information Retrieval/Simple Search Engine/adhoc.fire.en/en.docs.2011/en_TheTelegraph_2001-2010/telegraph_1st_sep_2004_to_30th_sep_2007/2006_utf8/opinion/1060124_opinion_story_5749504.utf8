 THE REVOLUTION AND ITS CHILDREN

 Given the political insouciance of Nepal?s political leaders, Jyoti Malhotra wonders if there is anything they could learn from India?s example

 Fear factor

 So without much further ado, let?s put the Nepal story in perspective: Nepal?s seven-party political alliance held a massive rally on January 20, less than two weeks before the first anniversary of the proclamation of emergency by the king of Nepal. King Gyanendra has ordered a major crackdown. Nearly 60 middle-rung leaders and about 300 student and union leaders have been arrested.The formerprime minister, G.P. Koirala, and the former foreign minister and communist leader, Madhav Nepal, are under house arrest. With nearly 15,000 army and armoured police on the streets during the curfew, Kathmandu looks like a ghost town.

 For far too long, the king of Nepal has considered himself the avatar of Vishnu. But if the slogans of the Nepalese people against King Gyanendra on curfew day in Kathmandu are any indication, that particular piece of myth-making is fast fading in this rather slovenly Shangrila. However, sloganeering hardly ever made a revolution.

 And so, despite their decision to settle overt differences and forge a united alliance a couple of months ago, Nepal?s political parties have fallen far short of their promises to challenge the monarchy and shake the ground beneath Gyanendra?s feet. For a start, they were taken utterly by surprise when the government ordered that curfew would begin at 8 am and continue upto 6 pm. The parties had thought that they would have a rather gentlemanly time of it, perhaps saunter into the heart of town at Asantpur and shake their fist at a king who was far, far away in the eastern kingdom addressing his people.

 Perhaps it is hardly fair to criticize the political parties, especially when they have had only 15 years to experiment with democracy compared to 56 that parties have had in India (save the three years of Emergency). The independent nation had also been fortunate with its leaders compared to the faction-riven Nepali Congress. 

 Moreover, what could one expect a few thousand leaderless, rudderless young and middle-aged men to do against the all-powerful security forces when all their leaders were in jail? Surely, it was hardly their fault that they ran from the sight of the determined men in blue fatigues, wanting to clobber them with the same passion that they show the Maoists.

 More and more, it began to appear in Kathmandu last week that the answer to the nation?s political ills was satyagraha or Mahatma Gandhi?s non-violent method of protesting against the powerful. The advantage with satyagraha is that you don?t really need powerful orators to lead the masses, men of determination and will-power will do. If the seven-party alliance considers this instrument of protest and adapts it to the needs of the time in Nepal, it might manage to skake the monarchy.

 Meanwhile, the lesson from last week?s protest-that-never-happened is that the king?s considerable and overwhelming use of force against a few thousand men with nothing to declare but their anti-monarchy slogans, showed that King Gyanendra was really scared. There is no other way to explain the presence of 15,000 army and armoured police on the streets, the area around the Narayanhity palace taken over by the army. The king looked like he was using an armoured personnel carrier to swat a fly. However, a more reasonable answer would be that the display also showed that Gyanendra?s core competence remains the defence forces.

 Not only is he the commander-in-chief of the army, but the king?s direct control of the Royal Nepal Army is also part of the unfinished business of the 1990 democratic revolution.

 In the 15 years since, the monarchy has played that trump card extremely effectively, and none more so than Gyanendra. But as the feeling grows about his inability to bring peace to the country ? especially the Kathmandu valley ? more and more democrats are talking about there being ?no alternative? to limiting the king to a ceremonial role as part of a revamped constitution. But to rewrite the constitution only after 15 years would require the services of a constituent assembly. Which is exactly what the Maoists have been demanding for a long time.

 The other question that inevitably crops up is whether the alliance between the Maoists and the political parties is for show or for keeps. Shekhar Koirala, the gentle doctor from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, told some of us from a secret location in Kathmandu last week that there was no alternative to the Maoists and the political parties fighting together. Maoists have the cadre to institute change, certainly to take on the monarchy one day, hopefully without violence. But it is also a fact that G.P. Koirala hasn?t still publicly come out in favour of the Maoists, despite the 12-point agreement between the two entities.

 What should India do then? The fact is that New Delhi continues to bother about its somewhat out-of-date ?twin pillar? thesis of constitutional monarchy and multi-party democracy that must guide Nepal through these troubled times. 

 A lot of Nepalese are beginning to ask why India should bother with drawing such a fine line when it comes to the king (perhaps because a lot of former royals within the Congress party are related to what is left of the Nepal royalty?), when all it needs to do is simply echo and anticipate what the country wants. Which is, simply put, a democracy.

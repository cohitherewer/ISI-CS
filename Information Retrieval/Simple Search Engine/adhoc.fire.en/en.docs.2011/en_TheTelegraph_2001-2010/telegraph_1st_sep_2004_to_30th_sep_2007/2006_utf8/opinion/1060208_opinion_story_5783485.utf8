 FREEDOM FOR KEEPS

 The odd man out 

/ Raoji Bandodkar

 Special trait

 In the Indo-US statement of July 18 2005, India and the United States of America resolved to ?create an international environment conducive to promotion of democratic values, and to strengthen democratic practices in societies which wish to become more open and pluralistic.? The last phrase is an important caveat, which enables India to proclaim its democratic credentials, which are beyond dispute, and to continue its traditional policy of refraining from the active promotion of democracy in the region of its immediate influence.

 We, in India, take for granted the basic freedoms which are rare elsewhere in the developing world, but however much the government may think it is desirable for mankind, it has no inclination to propagate the faith beyond our borders. India is regarded as a model of continuing democratic traditions since independence, though Indira Gandhi declared an Emergency with the support of a supine Congress party due to fears of growing domestic opposition and a mythical foreign hand, and suspended human rights and political freedoms between 1974 and 1977, when extra-constitutional and unaccountable circles close to the prime minister took far-reaching decisions. Given the chastening experience of the Emergency, it might be supposed that India would be more convinced than most about the virtues of free speech, democratic norms and accountability. But this has not converted India into an apostle of democracy even in its immediate region, let alone beyond. India, like the US or any other major power, has no record of supporting or promoting democracy for its own sake, but rather on the basis of a pragmatic assessment of the effect of democracy in the region in the light of its own national interests.

 South Asia has had many periods of undemocratic rule. Pakistan suffered the first military coup d?tat in south Asia in 1958 and has had a military-guided government ever since, even during periods of civilian government elected through or despite the ballot box. In Nepal, except for brief periods, the powers of the king have been sweeping, whether exercised by himself or exercised on his behalf by an unaccountable aristocratic coterie. Bhutan is an absolute monarchy with a veneer of popular representation, though it is likely that the king enjoys backing among the majority of the Bhutanese people. Maldives has the dubious reputation of having one of the longest serving presidents (Abdul Gayoom, since 1978) in the world, and a non-party system in which candidates have to be officially vetted and approved. Political parties were only permitted to be registered in mid-2005 and have yet to contest an election. Sri Lanka has an unbroken history of elections but has suffered a de facto partition of the country and civil war, leading to an emergency situation. Bangladesh was therefore not unusual in the region for having an autocratic government almost from its inception as an independent state. The expectations of an enlightened democratic system under Sheikh Mujibur Rahman after 1971 were undermined by mismanagement and growing disillusion, leading to his declaring himself president for life, and one party rule of the Awami League. When Rahman was overthrown in a military coup in 1975, rule from the army barracks followed for 15 years until 1990. In Myanmar. India is anxious to work with a military junta with an abysmal human rights record which has been in power since 1962. In the neighbouring countries, it is hard to detect the hand of India prodding, persuading or cajoling the leaders to emulate India?s democratic standards. Is it because of a strict definition of non-interference in other countries? internal affairs, or is it because experiments with democracy across our borders have usually led to elected governments that have been either anti-Indian or non-responsive?

 In October 25, 2005, the external affairs ministry announced that India had donated $5 million to the United Nations Democracy Fund, the largest single remittance of the time. Such gestures conceal the fact that India, like most countries, pursues its own interests irrespective of the virtues of following an ethical foreign policy to promote human rights, democracy and the rule of law. India has used the pretext of promoting democracy when the occasion demands it, but it has seen in Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh, for instance, that the fruits of democracy have not necessarily been to India?s advantage. It would be better to refrain from any inference that New Delhi is likely to change its traditional stance.

 It is acknowledged that there is no such thing as a perfectly functioning democracy. In India, the common man lacks any faith in the legal system, except for the Supreme Court. Elsewhere, it can be justice delayed and denied, and that too, at an exorbitant cost. In most of the huge backlog of cases in the courts, the government itself is involved as a litigant. Why does it not take steps to have at least those cases resolved quickly? Why does the highest appeal court in the land deal with matters like garbage collection and unauthorized occupation of government accommodation unless there is a total breakdown of governance? There is wholly inadequate representation of females in parliament and the state legislatures. 

 There is lack of transparency in government, even in matters that touch on the safety and security of the population. It is commonly believed that the true figures of the incidence of HIV/AIDS are suppressed. What are the steps to protect the population against the pandemic of H5N1 virus or avian flu? 

 Cash for questions and the MPLAD scandal in parliament came as no surprise to the long-suffering public. Perhaps the speaker and the chairman of the Rajya Sabha need to set up their own corps of vigilantes to check on other abuses of a member of parliament?s privileges, such as rent or staff accommodation and sales of railway tickets and attestations of documents. India ranks joint 71st, along with a country like Zimbabwe, out of 102 countries on Transparency International?s 2002 corruption index. The prime minister, following tradition, does not make regular radio or TV broadcasts or even give regular press conferences. It is not the fashion of our leaders to be accessible, except when in the company of visiting dignitaries or when they themselves are travelling abroad.

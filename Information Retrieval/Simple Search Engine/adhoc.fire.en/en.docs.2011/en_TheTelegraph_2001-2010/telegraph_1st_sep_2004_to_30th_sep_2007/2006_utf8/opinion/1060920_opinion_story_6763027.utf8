 Most unremarkable

 Sir Pope Benedict XVIs remark about Islam has been irresponsible (Popes jihad remarks spark Muslim anger, Sept 16). Instead of preaching fellow-feeling and universal brotherhood amongst the adherents of different religions, he is propagating hatred. This seems to be the problem with most religious leaders at the helm. When they ought to highlight the commonalities of different religions, they end up dividing society. However, those offended at the popes comments should show restraint and stay calm. Protests must not lead to violence.

 Yours faithfully,

Masood Md. Sohail, Calcutta

 Sir While referring to Islam, the pope must have forgotten the reaction of sections of the Christian community, particularly that of the Vatican, over the film, The Da Vinci Code. There is already a lot of controversy among historians, as well as among Muslims, about the Prophet and his teachings. Most religious figures of different faiths have been such controversial figures. However, it goes without saying, that followers of Islam have tended to react more angrily than most other communities when any remark is made about the Prophet by a non-Muslim. Bearing this in mind, and given the current tensions prevailing between the largely Christian West and the Islamic countries, the pope should have been cautious while talking about a religion other than his own.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The popes diplomatic apology cannot hide his real intentions. The best rebuttal of the misconception that Islam was spread by the sword is in De Lacy OLearys book, Islam at Crossroads. It says that history shows that the legend of fanatical Muslims sweeping through the world and enforcing Islam by the sword is an absurd myth. Look at Spain, where Muslims were brutally ejected after ruling for almost 800 years, or India, where Muslims ruled for almost 1,000 years, or Indonesia and Malaysia where, despite a Muslim majority, there has never been a religious war. The histories of these countries suggest that intellect and peace helped the spread of Islam. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Pope Benedict XVIs comments could cause a tectonic shift in the understanding of the non-Muslim perception of Islam. It might explain why the term Islamo-fascists does not sound strange in the context of the developments in Islamic societies. The popes remark could at best be interpreted as a partly flawed, partly accurate view of Islam. It may not be entirely untrue to say that Islam advocates bloodshed. It does see the spread of other religions as inimical to its own growth and influence. Muslims are urged to take corrective measures to change such negative perceptions of their immediate world. Muslim intellectuals must leave no stone unturned in bringing Islam out of the shadow of the jihadis and help it regain its lost glory. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The pope has spoken like a populist politician, and not like a spiritual leader. He does not even realize that he has rubbed salt on the wounded psyche of the educated, liberal and peace-loving majority in Islamic societies. A religious leader of his stature must remember that Christians are also guilty of mass conversions, and not always through peaceful means.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Where George W. Bush failed, the pope has triumphed. Ordinary individuals have nothing to lose when they speak their mind in public. But when the head of a religious community or that of a powerful country does the same, he has to take into account the negative publicity that he might create.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Pope Benedict XVI is drawing flak for his alleged portrayal of Islam as a faith that adopted violence as a legitimate means of conversion a view popular during medieval times, but no longer. Even Islamic terrorists do not have conversion as their main objective. Islam preaches brotherhood as a fundamental tenet while Christianitys basic doctrine is love. 

 There is one interesting fact about India though. Despite the unfettered proselytization during British rule, the total population of Christians has never exceeded 2.5 per cent of the total population of the country. In contrast, the Muslim population in India has always been substantial. One wonders whether this would have been possible without the use of physical force during Muslim rule. 

 Yours faithfully,

 FUN FOR OUTSIDE ALLIES

 MALVIKA SINGH

 When senior CPI(M) leaders are seen lobbying energetically for the extensions of secretaries to the government of India, a coalition in which their party is not an intrinsic part of the government but merely an ?outside ally? which has shown itself up as opportunist, it is very disturbing and needs to be stopped in its tracks. Equally, for a bureaucrat to ?use? a politburo member to ferry the cause of an extension in the job to those in power is unsavoury and a continuation of the malpractice that has, over the years, become embedded in politics.

 Is this an example of ?good governance? that the left party in question hammers on about? Is this its leaders? definition of ?correctness? in administration? Or is this their way of ?infiltrating? a government that they refused to join but wanted to fiddle around with to their own ends? Is this their way of trying to intervene without responsibility or accountability, in an attempt to disrupt the party in power? Is this part of the silly game of wanting to bring the UPA to its knees in the hope of forcing another alliance, a third front, with which they can play another kind of disruptive game? 

 The CPI(M) is fast becoming a detrimental bedfellow. Small wonder that the Congress-led UPA is unable to make its own secretarial appointments without frenzied lobbying from the left. The left has serious problems with the Congress and has always been its fierce opponent. This time, for selfish reasons that suited its greed for power, which allowed it to play a role at the Centre, something that was denied it by the voter, it grabbed the opportunity to become an ?outside ally? and has relentlessly corroded the government?s position on all fronts.

 Take care, look left

 Coalition politics is not the politics of blackmail. ?Blackmail-type politics is to do with immature politicians, those who have never worked at the grassroots but have risen in the ranks for other reasons. ?Earnest?, innocent, na?ve do-gooding types, running about holding a banner for the ?downtrodden? and indulging in politicking laced with the rhetoric of a past century, do not trigger and establish real and genuine change and growth. What the CPI(M) harps on about, all political parties have within their manifestos. Neither egalitarianism nor ?human rights? is the personal preserve of the left. It is time for the Congress-led UPA to say so. The government must do what it has set out to do and if the lot sitting in the opposition benches want to vote against it, so be it.

 Manmohan Singh needs to call the shots as he chooses. He needs to, in his inimitable, gentle and quiet manner, spell out to his colleagues his gameplan and priorities for the social sector and the market. One needs an enormous input of infrastructure and money whereas the other needs to be unshackled to generate the money for the social sector. He understands the how-to-do-it better than the rest on the scene. He must present that blueprint to the nation through the cabinet and the parliament and set new, clean parameters for policy and implementation. He is the only leader today, at a national level, who will be trusted to deliver for all if given a free hand to do so. His Congress colleagues must be issued a whip by the party president to stop hindering the government through their congenital habit of back biting furiously for bettering their ?jobs?.

 The Congress, meanwhile, needs to get its act together. It needs to pull in workers at the grass roots. It needs to work. It has not worked for decades. It has let down this plural society. It has, by its inability to change with the realities of a new generation, killed the premise it was built on. Why cannot it be led into a revival? Why is it allowing reactionary forces, both Left and Right, to raise their dangerous heads that will lead to the polarizing and division of a plural polity?

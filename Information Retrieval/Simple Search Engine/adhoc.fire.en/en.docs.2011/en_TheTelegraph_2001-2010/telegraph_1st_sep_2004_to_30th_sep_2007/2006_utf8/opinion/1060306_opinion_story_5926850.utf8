 Extracts from the ILO?s regional high-level tripartite meeting on the Role of Labour Inspections in Combating Child Labour, Harare, 2001

 In order to make labour inspection more effective in the fight against child labour, labour inspectors must be familiar with the problem and aware of the possible consequences for children. The appropriate training of inspectors therefore is a critical dimension of effective enforcement. 

 ....International standards must be used to improve the quality of training so that the inspectorate can respond to its dual role of prevention and protection. The experiences of past inspection visits should be introduced as case studies in the training process. There is an urgent need to improve skills in data collection, maintaining records, writing reports and conducting the various interventions in order to ensure effective monitoring....Inspectors need to be made aware of the intrinsic value of abolishing or regulating child labour...Knowledge of international standards and reporting procedures must therefore be integrated into the training of labour inspectors in order to help them fulfil their role in identifying the shortcomings of laws and policies.

 Any significant role in combatting child labour inevitably requires labour inspectors to be trained in number of additional areas, starting with the phenomenon of child labour itself, its incidence and range and the desirability of its abolition as well as the relevant international standards and national regulations. In view of the sensitive nature of child labour, there is a need for training in functions of labour inspectors. Employing women labour inspectors ...can be helpful since they are perhaps perceived as less daunting...they are certainly more acceptable where only girls are employed or where religious attitudes require that women talk to girl workers and inspect their working conditions.

 Labour inspectors...often have considerable sympathy for the child workers and their families and the impossible dilemmas they face; for many parents, especially mothers alone and parents in situations of extreme poverty...there is simply no alternative to putting their children to work....

 Training is the appropriate way for inspectors to acquire the necessary professional understanding in such emotionally demanding situations. A clear policy and effective methods need to be developed on this aspect of the work....Inspectors? status needs to be enhanced and their working conditions improved, if labour inspection is to be carried out in the most effective and efficient way.

 Labour inspectors regularly find themselves under...pressure...because of the threat they appear to represent to important economic interests....They therefore need recognition, respect and support at the political level and from the community, but this is difficult to achieve if their independence is threatened, their status low, and their salaries and working conditions inadequate. Unfortunately, this is often the case and, in such circumstance, will result in low motivation and poor performance and, at worst, a serious risk of corruption, and further downscaling of status....It is necessary to improve salaries and conditions in various ways, and...increase the number of inspectors...

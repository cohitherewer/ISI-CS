The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 BREAK THE CHAIN

 A country in which implementing the rule of law unleashes violence on the streets is in a very sorry state indeed. It would not be quite accurate to describe casualties in the conflict between traders and the administration in Delhi as victims of police violence. It is lawlessness, corruption and politicking of cosmic proportions that create unfortunate situations like this. In India, corruption is a great chain of being. Therefore, any effort on the part of the courts to root out even a few local links in that chain results in violence and in the undermining of the judiciary itself. Judicial activism is, in any case, not something that the courts should be forced into by an inept government with its own stakes in the perpetuation of a clearly illegal situation. But when the courts do rule, then a repeated failure to implement the ruling, or repeatedly finding ways sometimes the most extreme ones of getting round the order makes the courts look ineffectual and redundant. Unauthorized commercial structures have mushroomed and struck secure roots in Delhi because of an archaic rent control law, whose reform would put political parties at a serious disadvantage by jeopardizing their vote-banks. Hence, the municipality and police are repeatedly pressured by the political establishment to go slow on demolitions, and an entire system of wrongdoing is thus put, and kept, in place.

 What happened in Delhi could well happen in Calcutta too. One just has to imagine what would happen if the administration here just went by court orders and the rule of law, ignored all party-political injunctions and evicted hawkers or squatters from where they were not supposed to be, or even went on a similar sealing drive in some areas of the city. Calcutta remains one of the most dangerously polluted cities in the world simply because the electoral interests of the state government conflict with the international auto-emission regulations. Buses, taxis and autorickshaws can get away with breaking the law because the government is unwilling and unable to do what the courts have repeatedly asked it to do. Delhis judicially activated changeover into CNG, for instance, had faced the same sort of resistance. But it did finally happen, and is now an exemplary success story. The court should take heart from this and stand by its ruling. And the administrations in other Indian cities, particularly Calcutta, should heed the lessons of Delhi.

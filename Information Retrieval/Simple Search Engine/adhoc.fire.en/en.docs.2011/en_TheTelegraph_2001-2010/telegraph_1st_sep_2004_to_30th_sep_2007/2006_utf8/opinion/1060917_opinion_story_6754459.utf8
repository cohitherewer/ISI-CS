The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 n First the BJP netas lost power. Now, it seems that they have lost their cool. It was Ananth Kumar who first saw red when a constable stopped him from entering the press enclosure during the partys conclave in Dehra Dun. Kumar even waved his badge, but the constable was unmoved and directed him to the members enclosure. A seething Kumar then decided on a fistfight but was restrained by members of the press. However, Kumar does have company. During the same event, Siddharth Nath Singh, the BJPs media convener, was stopped by another policeman on his way to a meeting. A heated argument ensued and Singh was heard telling the constable rok ke dikha. The BJP leader had no idea that he had met his match, The constable coolly retorted, ja ke dikha and held his ground, and soon it was a free-for-all. However, it was the constable who had the last laugh and a sulking Singh was forced to return to his hotel room.

 n Hot-headed young leaders have drawn a rather cold response from the grand old man of the BJP. Atal Bihari Vajpayee warned in Dehra Dun that old men in the party cannot be discarded like pieces of furniture. Vajpayees not-quitting-anytime-now mantra has not go down too well with the likes of Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley. Even the bosses at Nagpur are miffed. The old man has thrown a spanner in the RSSs plan of succession in the BJP. Sangh parivar insiders revealed the real reason for the grouse was that both Vajpayee and Advani were older than the current crop of RSS leaders. Hence, the young men were finding it difficult to manage their old folks.

 Lok Sabha speaker Somnath Chatterjee is at it again. First he came up with the idea of starting a TV channel for the Lok Sabha. Playing the perfect communist, Chatterjee then turned to the public sector undertakings for financing his dream project. Unfortunately, his proposal was shot down by the Rajya Sabha on grounds of conflicting interests. Nonetheless, the upper house allowed a live telecast of its proceedings, only when the house was in session. The Lok Sabha channel, however, remains a 24/7 affair and all manner of people and programmes are aired on it. The other day, there was even a panel discussion on how one should carry injections and syringes while travelling. For the want of interesting programmes, the channel is often forced to churn out forgotten topics and faces with an alarming regularity. Will someone please tell Chatterjee to do something for the sake of the viewer? Why not show the footages of the hilariously unruly scenes, which often force him to adjourn the house? 

 The other day it was reported that Rahul Gandhi had to cut short his visit to Amethi after spraining his ankle. Angry villagers, who had gathered expecting Rahul to announce new industrial projects for the constituency, raised slogans against their favourite son after he cancelled his visit abruptly. One would have imagined him to rest for a few days to get back on his feet. But a mere sprain is unlikely to bother the young gun. As soon as he landed in the capital, an agile Rahul boarded a flight which was headed towards foreign shores.

 BJPwallahs attending the National Executive in Dehra Dun were aghast to find Feroze Varun Gandhis posters adorning the walls near the venue. The pictures of the holy trinity Atal-Advani-Rajnath was nowhere in sight. A sheepish Varun told the gathering that it was the handiwork of his supporters from a neighbouring district and he had no role to play in the mischief. But very few in the party were willing to accept his version of the story. Across the fence though, Congressmen nodded their heads in a show of sympathy. It is only the Congress culture sweeping the rank and file of the BJP, quipped a party leader. As far as we are concerned, we think that there is still hope for dynastic politics in India. 

 The Union home secretary, VK Duggal, the custodian of Indias law and order, is a happy man these days. And all because his son, Sunil, has ended up writing a book on how unsafe India has become for its women. The junior Duggal seems to have a special dislike for government security agencies. So much so that he ended up starting a security agency of his own. At the book launch, this agency was in charge of the security arrangements. And even as the proud father watched his son pulling up the government for failing to guarantee the safety of women, Duggals own security guards were pushed to a corner by men from Sunils company. This probably shows that men in this country are not exactly safe always either. But what made Sunil start his agency? Apparently, he was peeved at the way women were treated at discotheques which he visits frequently. Now that is called mixing business with pleasure. Did that also inspire Sunil to write his book?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 For the current practitioner of Gandhigiri, life seems to be as full of trials and tribulations as it had been for the original proponent of the ideal. Sanjay Dutts admirers may even point out that their hero has been no less stoic in response to hardships than the Mahatma himself. The stars problems, they insist, started not just with his fascination for the AK-56, which got him booked under the arms act. It got steadily worse as ruling dispensations in Maharashtra tried to play politics with the gun. When Sharad Pawar took over as CM, he is supposed to have upgraded Sanjus case as one to be tried under the Tada. The move prompted Congressman, Sunil Dutt, to knock on several doors, including the lair of Bal Thackeray. There was thus little surprise when some ten days before the courts verdict, the Dutts did their rounds of the political durbar in Delhi, paying courtesy calls. Congress circles are now agog with rumours that Munnabhais services may be used to shore up the partys prospects in Uttar Pradesh. All that, however, depends on how the court decides to punish him, and for how long. Which means that in case of a severe punishment, it will not only be Bollywoods film producers who will be losing out.

 Munnabhai or no Munnabhai, Congresswallahs are already in a spot in UP. The partys gameplan in the state seems to be going awry with every passing day. It had been banking on the BSP leader, Mayavati, to throw a lifeline to the party. The Congress leadership had even hoped that the threat of the CBI investigations into the Taj corridor scam would keep her in place. The apex court order, reinstating the probe against her, has, quite definitely, scuppered the Congress plan. Mayavati is now under no obligation to accommodate the party and is, once again, free to decide who she wishes to dance with.

 The Vasundhara Raje Scindia-Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw liplock at the India Economic Summit recently has had a load of people speculating on the incident. One has called it a society fashion. Although neither Scindia nor Mazumdar-Shaw has deigned to comment on it, the CMs office has declared that it was a peckgone-wrong. One of the ladies did not turn the other cheek in time!

 As fate would have it, a Venezuelan peacenik, who has been in violence-prone areas and survived Afghanistans lawlessness, ran out of luck in Indias Chambal. On a world peace mission, the man got mugged by dacoits at Shivpuri who took away everything he was carrying. When the peace activist shouted in broken English that he was on a peace mission to oppose Americas policy in Iraq, the robbers gave him a sound thrashing. Aghast, the foreigner later asked the local police authorities why he had been beaten up despite surrendering everything he had. The police official gave him the rationale. Chambals dacoits, he said, were not in the habit of earning without labour. The peacemaker is still pondering the definition of labour.

 When it comes to local flavour, even Indians are at a loss. Take the plight of the AICC gen-sec, Digvijay Singh, who is in charge of Andhra Pradesh. Diggy Raja cannot fathom anything from the tales which angry leaders narrate to him in Telugu. In their hurry, they forget that the man cannot understand a word of their language. Not unnaturally, Digvijay proved a complete failure when he tried to broker peace between two Congress MPs, Satyanarayan Reddy and L Rajgopal. Neither Diggys English nor Hindi made an impression on the warring MPs. Last heard, Digvijay had hired a tutor to teach him the basics of Telugu. One still wonders if he will be able to play the arbiter with much success.

 As is history by now, Shah Rukh Khan has replaced Big B as the celebrity anchor of KBC III. But the parting of ways between the TV channel and Amitabh Bachchan apparently wasnt very cordial. Bachchan was not against continuing with the show, provided the channel renegotiated his contract. And the channel was willing to consider a new contract if B-B recorded the nearly two-dozen episodes left of the previous show which was disrupted when the megastar fell ill. Talks, however, broke down. Bachchan is said to have refunded the fees already taken for the incomplete show. One thing led to the other and in walked the reigning star of Bollywood to herald a Don in Indian living rooms. 

 A single-minded pursuit of self-interest is the key to political success. There is K Natwar Singh who can vouch for that. So long as Natwar was the leading light of the Congress, he was most pugnacious in advertising his loyalty to the Nehru-Gandhis. So profound was this loyalty that he was ready to wipe out from public memory the feats of the previous government in international affairs. He would pointedly hark back to the Shimla summit and other such high points of the Congress era without making even an oblique reference to the saffronites foreign dalliances. All that seems to have changed after he was shunted out of the cabinet on account of the oil-for-food scandal. He now appears more than willing to give the devil its due. In a recent newspaper article, he went as far as to say that AB Vajpayee broke new ground in 2004. Is it because the Congress no longer needs him or the opposition has shown its willingness to use his services?

 NOT STARRY-EYED

 The visit of the president of the United States of America, Mr George W. Bush, is imbued with significance. Mr Bush?s visit is coming at a time when bilateral relations between India and the US have touched an all-time high. Indeed, even the shrill protest by sections of the public in India merely illustrate the degree of importance that is being attached to the visit. The focus of attention is clearly on the nuclear deal, but even without a final agreement on this issue, the visit will retain great importance. There are a number of sectors, from agriculture to education to science and technology, which will receive a big boost from Mr Bush?s visit. The last visit of an American president took place in 2000. And while Mr Bush may lack the charisma of Mr Bill Clinton, the Indo-US relationship has greater substance now. 

 India?s strategic elite, however, harbours a paradoxical view of the US. On the one hand, a section of the elite continues to be suspicious of US policies on south Asia. Some of this tension, of course, is a legacy of the Cold War, but this sentiment is kept alive by the US?s relationship with Pakistan and ? more generally ? by Washington?s perceived behaviour in international politics. On the other hand, such apprehensions notwithstanding, there is strong support for engaging the only superpower in a meaningful relationship, and for building a strong, pragmatic partnership with it. The terms ?natural allies? and ?strategic partners?, often used for India and the US, have a deep resonance with India?s strategic elite. The belief that there is long-term strategic convergence between the two countries is a common assumption in the corridors of power where the contours of India?s policy towards the US are formulated. Economic and technological ties, educational and societal links, shared concern over China?s future, and the common battle against terrorism are key factors that bind the US and India together. A shared commitment to pluralism, democracy and the free-market, as well as the successful Indian diaspora in the US, provide strong foundations for the growth of the relationship. Economically, the US is India?s largest trading partner and vital to its recognition as a global player. A modus vivendi with the US is seen as not just desirable, but a necessity if India has to translate its aspirations into reality. 

 Nobody denies the presence of many irritants, and some are not trivial. Yet, India?s relationship with the US in 2006 seems to be more secure than it has ever been in the last fifty years. Not only is there greater connectivity at the level of the political leadership and senior officials, but the scope of the relationship has also greatly expanded. Mr Bush?s visit is being taken as a sign that India has, at last, found a place on the radar screen of Washington?s policy community. This has bolstered the confidence of India?s policy-makers to deal with Uncle Sam rather than fawn over him.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 PAST CALLS

 Sourav Ganguly must be rewriting that famous description of mixed feelings in seeing ones mother-in-law drive ones new BMW over a cliff. He must be happy to be called back to the Indian side. But that happiness must be counterbalanced by the fact that he has to bat in South Africa where the wickets are bouncy, quick and where the ball seams a bit. Also, test matches, with no restrictions on fielders on the off side, are not exactly the form of cricket where he has recently got runs. Besides, he goes out to join a side that is demoralized by a series of ignominious defeats in one-day internationals. As Ganguly flies out to South Africa, his mind will surely be on these issues as well as on the recollection of the spat he had with the coach of the Indian team, Greg Chappell. Gangulys own form, since he was dropped from the side, has not been exemplary. He has failed to perform many times against less-than-mediocre bowling. While this may not be the best time for him to return to the team, it is certainly the best time for him to return to form.

 Opinions on Gangulys recall will remain divided. Many will hold that it is backward-looking. He belongs to Indian crickets past, not the future, which belongs to younger players. But others, especially Gangulys innumerable supporters, will argue that his recall corrects an injustice that had been done to him. The other important aspect of this episode is the number of powerful and influential people, with nothing to do with cricket, who have raised their voice in favour of Gangulys reinstatement in the Indian squad. What Gangulys supporters do not realize is that his inclusion in the side, in the recent past, was not warranted by his performance. He was not getting runs, his technique, always weak, was faltering, his feet were not moving and he was a liability on the field. He was dropped for these and other cricketing reasons, not at the behest of someones personal whims. Many of these reasons have currently become irrelevant because the entire Indian side seems to be afflicted with Gangulys faults. In that negative sense, he is a perfect fit. If Ganguly scores runs, the past will be forgotten. But those who have the future of cricket in mind will hope for a more fundamental solution to whatever ails Indian cricket.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 LEFT HALF-WAY

 Two sets of agenda prompted the left?s support to Mr Manmohan Singh?s government. One, that was reflected in its common minimum programme, related to governance. The other was inspired by the left?s political strategy to keep the Bharatiya Janata Party out of power as well as to try and influence the government?s policies. When the left decided not to join the United Progressive Alliance government but to support it from outside, it was accused of trying to wield power without sharing the government?s responsibilities. Two years later, the confusion about the left?s role in New Delhi has only worsened. Its intervention has generally been more a hindrance than a help for the government. Its opposition to reforms, especially in banking, retail and agriculture, has been a constant source of irritation for the government. Given the fact that Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee takes a pro-reform position on many of these issues, it has not been easy to judge which one is the real face of the left. Yet, the left is anxious to take its share of credit for the government?s steps, such as the rural employment guarantee scheme, which it sees as positive. Its view of the government?s failures is similarly prejudiced by its own agenda. The stalemate over a pension fund policy is a case in point. 

 It is unlikely, though, that the left would withdraw its support to the UPA government, unless an unforeseen situation forces its hands. The resounding victory of the left in West Bengal and Kerala in the assembly elections could prompt it to mount fresh pressures on the government. There is little doubt that the left?s protests over the government?s moves to build closer ties with the United States of America will become shriller. There will be other issues, such as labour reforms and privatization of airports, that will see the left complaining. Much of these will be familiar political rhetoric aimed at the left?s social and political constituency. Such noises will surely be heard at the meeting of the central committee of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in Hyderabad next month. But the left should be as answerable to the people as the UPA for the government?s failures. It has to admit that an interventionist role is not necessarily an obstructionist one. Helping a government survive is no good if that means holding its policies to ransom. The left has an unprecedented position in New Delhi, but seems still unsure about what to do with it.

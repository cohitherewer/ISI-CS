 UP IN ARMS

 Policies are sometimes quite mysterious. What, for example, was the policy behind the induction of women into the armed forces? A series of recent incidents has revealed the fact that some women are becoming extremely, even tragically, unhappy in their chosen profession in the forces, and the reasons for that remain somehow shrouded in confusion. The public interest litigation asking for permanent commission for women in the army has brought to light a strangely muddled approach to women in the army. The arguments seem to be bewilderingly circular: training in the army is devoted to the development of combat leaders, while the existing policy excludes women from combat training. Therefore, women play a limited role ? does this mean decorative? ? and thus cannot be considered for permanent commission. This is impossible to fathom logically. The explanations have to be sought in some other sphere. But it must be acknowledged first that there is something woolly-headed about the policy to induct women into the armed forces. There is also a weak hope that it is possible to get away with tokenism.

 A burden of unspoken assumptions and resistances are associated with women in the army. Some of these are cultural ? although the army?s argument seems unsure about which bits of the cultural assumptions it should cling to. One, given the backgrounds from which most of the recruits come, women commanders may not be quite acceptable. Two, given these same backgrounds, women and men working together in confined spaces may not be acceptable. It is not clear who is chary of accepting what in each of the two cases. This is just one example of a flawed argument. The question is of maximizing the human resources available. Women in the armed forces should be trained the way men are. Just as the army should know exactly why they are inducting women, women too should know what is expected of them when they enter the discipline. They should not be expecting peace postings and non-combat roles if they are looking for permanent commission. It is not enough to put on a show of equality, it needs grit as well as an ability to adjust in order to be able to lay claim to a true parity. If the right to a permanent commission has to be earned, the army should provide the opportunity to women to be able to do so.

 WINNING STREAK

 Mr Lakshmi Mittal?s victory in gaining Arcelor has been greeted with jubilation in India, with Messrs Chidambaram and Kamal Nath expressing pride that an Indian had become the world?s largest steel maker, a sentiment echoed by business leaders as well. And why not? Lakshmi Mittal?s businesses may be abroad, but he remains a shining example of Indian entrepreneurship. He has built a global empire from scratch by buying up decrepit steel units and turning them around. But his bid for Arcelor was in many ways a test case. As the Arcelor management made known all too plainly, despite his success Mittal was in many quarters still seen as an outsider. His acquisition of Arcelor conclusively proves that he has arrived. In the words of the Arcelor CEO, Mr Guy Dolle, he is now a manufacturer of perfume and not merely of cologne. 

 The victory has been all the sweeter because of the bruising battle that Mittal had to wage to gain control. The Arcelor management is now saying that its arrogant dismissal of earlier offers ? Mr Dolle referred to Mittal Steel shares as ?monopoly money? ? were meant only to extract a better deal for its shareholders. But that is doubtful, given the rage with which the Arcelor board had reacted when the bid was first made. In all probability, Arcelor overplayed its hand when it tried to make the Russian steel-maker, Severstal, a white knight. Key shareholders complained that Arcelor had overpaid for Severstal and that the management was taking them for granted. Mr Mittal?s improved offer finally forced the Arcelor management to capitulate. Clearly, this triumph is not only Mr Mittal?s, but also a victory for the Arcelor shareholders. The creation of shareholder value is evidently a more potent force than nationalist rhetoric. That is very heartening, because it shows that the barriers to growth in a globalized world are commercial, rather than based on colour or nationality. Other Indian entrepreneurs will doubtless be encouraged by the success of Mr Mittal?s bid.

 The deal gives Mittal new geographies and high-value-added products that will lend more stability to the company?s revenue stream. The steel industry as a whole will benefit because the deal is very likely to lead to mergers and acquisitions among other players as well. That will lead to more pricing power for steel-makers. But the question that the creation of the Arcelor-Mittal behemoth poses to Indian steel companies is this: how does a company like Tata Steel, slated to produce 7.5 million tonnes of steel by 2008, see the future when confronted with competition from the likes of Arcelor-Mittal, with over 100 million tonnes per year of raw steel capacity?

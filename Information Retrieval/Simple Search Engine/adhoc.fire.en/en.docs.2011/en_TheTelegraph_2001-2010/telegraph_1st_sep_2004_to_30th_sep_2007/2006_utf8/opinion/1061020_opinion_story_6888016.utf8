 Better late than never

 Sir The verdict passed by the Delhi high court in the Priyadarshini Mattoo murder case has restored the common mans faith in the judiciary (Guilty, after perversity, Oct 18). However, while praising the judgement, it should be kept in mind that it took seven agonizing years for the courts to nail the culprit. Santosh Kumar Singh, who raped and murdered the young woman, deserves the harshest punishment. At a time when corruption has pervaded the legislature and the bureaucracy, the courts are the only hope for ordinary Indians. This verdict shows that nobody is above the law of the land. However, there is more that needs to be done. First, the courts must ensure that justice is delivered in the shortest possible time. Second, the law must also be amended to stop influential people from interfering in the course of justice.

Yours faithfully, 

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee,Faridabad 

 Sir First, Santosh Kumar Singh was acquitted of murder charges. Then there was a retrial, which helped in nabbing him. All this raises serious concerns about judicial accountability. It is really surprising to note that the bench passed the judgement against Singh by using the same set of evidence, which was deemed inadequate by an earlier judge. When public servants err in judgment, either intentionally or by mistake, they are penalized. But the judiciary seems to be an exception to this rule. It is often seen that judgments passed by lower courts are overruled by higher courts of law. But the judges who deliver such questionable verdicts are seldom penalized for their actions. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Santosh Kumar Singh has been found guilty of the rape and murder of Priyadarshini Mattoo by the Delhi high court. Such a judgment goes to show that the law does not always take a different course in the case of the rich and the famous. However, in this particular case, justice will only be achieved when the courts punish those who were responsible for weakening the case against Singh in the first place. These people are no less guilty than Singh who killed the young woman. The bar council should also revoke Singhs licence, now that he has been found guilty. There has been a lot of talk about how the media played an important role in bringing about justice. However it has to be remembered that the media could only raise their voice as the judicial system is accountable in a democracy such as ours. Even a former chief justice had once lamented about the degree of corruption in the judiciary. It is time steps are taken to stem this rot to protect Indians from becoming victims of biased judgements. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The seventeenth of October will remain a red letter day in the history of the Indian judiciary. The courts have finally punished Santosh Singh, the son of a senior police officer, ten years after he committed the heinous crime. The grit and determination shown by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the victims father has finally borne fruit. When the judges meet later this month to discuss the nature of the punishment, they would hopefully award the death penalty to Singh. Only then can the nation be assured that justice, though delayed, has finally been done in this case. This would also raise hopes that the murderers of Jessica Lal and Nitish Katara would also have to pay for their crimes soon enough.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir While delivering the judgment against Santosh Kumar Singh, Justices R.S. Sodhi and P.K. Bhasin described the earlier acquittal as perverse. This is an interesting observation that raises several questions. For instance, one may be inclined to ask whether the earlier judge will now be asked to explain why he went about setting a murderer like Santosh Singh free.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The courts have convicted Santosh Kumar Singh, seven years after he was acquitted for the same offence.However, there is no need for Singh to fret about his fate. There is, after all, an easy way out for him. All he has to do is go to Kashmir, convert to Islam and petition the president for clemency. Politicians are sure to take up his cause, and leading lights of the Indian intelligentsia would then cry themselves hoarse demanding his freedom. And amidst such public clamour, the president will have no choice but to pardon him.

 Yours faithfully,

C.V.K. Moorthy, Bangalore

 Sir The verdict passed by the Delhi high court does not come as a surprise. But what is shocking is that it took ten years to arrive at this conclusion. This shows that mostly the law caters to the interests of those who wield power. Had it not been for the tenacity of Priyadarshinis father, justice would have eluded the victim. In criminal cases, the judiciary, under pressure from the media, might take up cudgels on behalf of the victims of injustice. But when it comes to cases in the civil court, such actions are few and far between. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.P. Ghosal, Calcutta

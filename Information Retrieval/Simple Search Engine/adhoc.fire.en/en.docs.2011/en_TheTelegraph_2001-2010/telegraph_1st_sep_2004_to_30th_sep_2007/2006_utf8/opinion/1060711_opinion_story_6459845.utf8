 ENTER THE DRAGON

 The reopening of Nathu-la is a momentous event, but not without some attendant concerns and nagging worries, writes Jyoti Malhotra

 Nice place for a stroll

 Moments before the Sikkim chief minister, Pawan Chamling, and his Tibetan counterpart, Champa Phuntsog, had cut a red ribbon and rewritten history at Nathu-la last week, the two mannequin-soldiers from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police and the PLA had been engaged in a little game of one-upmanship of sorts: first, the PLA soldier, standing shoulder to shoulder but mere inches from his Indian comrade right on the border which separates China from India, saw that the ITBP soldier was a little taller than him.

 And so a stool was brought for the PLA soldier so that he could now look down on the Indian. But the ITBP could not possibly stomach such an insult. They soon brought their own stool for their man to stand upon. Both soldiers thus stood until the red ribbon fluttered to the ground, and neither the fog, nor the rain, nor the horde of jostling cameramen could disturb their signal contribution to the moment.

 Thus, as the brass bands brought to celebrate the occasion at 14,400 feet drew attention, Pawan Chamling walked across into China without passport or travel permit. Only for a few minutes, but the border, sacrosanct since 1962, was definitely breached. As if returning the compliment, a couple of PLA commanders wandered into India. At first a little hesitant, then when they were mobbed by Indian women, they whipped out their ?made in China? digital cameras and recorded the moment for posterity.

 Oh what a moment it was! A rocky outcrop until a few months ago caught in a time-warp of history and hagiography, Nathu-la has now submitted to the collective yearning of the Sikkimese people for a place under the sun and the snow. Meanwhile, the realization grows in both Beijing and New Delhi that a Nathu-la success story may well be the key to unlock the border imbroglio that has held the bilateral relationship more or less hostage even before the 1962 war.

 Border trade at Nathu-la for now will be limited to the rather sublime, if somewhat ridiculous, kind of goods that used to be in fashion in the Fifties ? such as yak tail, yak butter, ghee and silk ? which the ministry of external affairs in New Delhi decided should suffice for both Sikkimese and Tibetan traders. But with the Nathu-la rocky outcrop blasted by the Border Roads Organization (the same party which thrives on slogans such as ?go gently on my curves?) to make way for a motorable road, even the MEA knows that those goods will soon be consigned to the dustbin of history. China?s ambassador to India, Sun Yuxi, visiting the pass (the first time a Chinese ambassador has been allowed to visit Sikkim), pointed out that Beijing was ready for container traffic across Nathu-la. Indeed, it was keen that the China Airways flight from Lhasa to Kathmandu be extended up to Delhi.

 For China, growing at a monstrous 9 per cent and hungry for more, it makes perfect sense to look for newer markets, and India?s more-or-less virginal east by north-east is just one such place on the map. Nathu-la and Sikkim are hardly ends in themselves. The Chinese are clearly looking at connecting with Kalimpong, Kohima and Calcutta. That is a clear 300 million people already.

 Still, the most interesting part in this Nathu-la story must be the change of mindset in New Delhi ? for which Pawan Chamling?s Hindi skills and political persuasion of both Atal Bihari Vajpayee as well as the economist-prime minister, Manmohan Singh, are partly responsible ? which turned from looking at Nathu-la as a snow-and-sleet-fed frontier outpost that helped keep the Chinese out, to one that used the instruments of the market to engage and get to know them better. So on the day of the re-opening, July 6, Manmohan Singh announced a central grant of Rs 600 crore to upgrade the national highway between Siliguri and Gangtok.

 But New Delhi as well as Gangtok are all too painfully aware that if trade at Nathu-la is to be opened to both truckers and tourists (Kailash Mansarovar lies about 300 km beyond, and Lhasa, the ultimate pilgrimage, just further), it must be done slowly and steadily so as not to swamp and overwhelm the Indian trader. 

 Sikkim?s economic adviser and professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, Mahendra Lama, who has studied the economic impact of reopening Nathu-la, points out that the pass will be ready to receive package tourists in about six to eight years and that large-scale traffic should be allowed in another 10 years.

 Still, it is not as if the ?Hindi-Chini bhai bhai? years are back, not even with the expected visit of the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, around October. New Delhi knows that the Chinese are developing major defence links with both Bangladesh and Myanmar, even as Beijing?s ?all-weather friendship? with Pakistan stands like the south Asian bedrock.

 Interestingly, it is despite these fundamentals that India wants to engage with China. India?s own economic progress is hardly tardy, and if Nathu-la allows cheap Chinese goods into India, it can also carry Indian goods into China.

 In fact, even the Indian security establishment?s obsession with intelligence agents disguised as traders, cuts both ways. It is a point the Mandarin-speaking foreign secretary, Shyam Saran, realizes well ? that Nathu-la is both a bridge and an entrep?t for the onward journey as well as the return.

 Still, there is no one in the world like the Chinese to learn from history. Beijing insisted that the Nathu-la pass be reopened on July 6, the dalai lama?s birthday. And while the sometimes-frosty-sometimes-cordial talks between the dalai lama?s representatives and Beijing continue, the latter seemed to be sending its own message, both to New Delhi and to the dalai lama.

 Here, the Chinese seemed to be saying, is the direct road to Lhasa. If you want, you can go home. And even if you don?t, let?s make one thing clear ? we have complete control over Tibet.

 Letters to Editor

 Highway to hell

 Sir India may be earning millions of rupees through the IT sector, but the government is strangely apathetic towards providing a safe working and commuting environment for the IT professionals who have put the country on the global map (Robbery stink in techie murder, Dec 24). The question is: are there any evening and late-night police patrols in Bangalore on the roads connecting IT hubs, mostly on the outskirts, to the various parts of the city? Or could it be that the police are hand-in-glove with these criminals and have a share in the spoils? Adhip Lahiri was apparently driving home at 10 in the night, which is not very late in a city like Bangalore. 

 The Calcutta police should immediately learn from this incident and tighten round-the-clock safety measures in Sector V, the EM bypass and the connectors which link Sector V to other areas of the city. The Calcutta EM bypass is very desolate at night and could be the hub of criminal activities if not guarded strictly. There should be police booths at adequate intervals and a police help-line should be started.

 Yours faithfully,

Abhijit Sen, Calcutta

 Sir One fails to understand why the IT companies and multinationals have such long working hours in our country be it Bangalore, Hyderabad or Calcutta. Other countries like Australia, the United States of America and the United Kingdom do not put at risk the personal safety of their IT executives through such lengths of time. Why can their Indian branches not reschedule the working hours of their professionals so that they do not have to work late?

 Yours faithfully,

Basudeb Bhattacharya, Calcutta

 Sir It took four days for the police to get to Adhip Lahiris silver Matiz, and that too, it was a chance discovery by two constables who happened to be curious. How does that rate the efficiency of the Bangalore police? Fifteen kilometres is not so long a distance that it cannot be covered in a single day. As for the fact that the car was hidden, do the authorities expect that the culprits will abandon the vehicle in a place where it can be easily found? Instead of being proud of the find, it is time the police learnt to be prompter at their work.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir The death of Adhip Lahiri shows how ruthless and money-minded people have become. This man was murdered for his money. And this is not the first death of its kind. Such crimes are common in Bangalore, especially in the IT and BPO sectors. The police should immediately upgrade their security services to protect other office-goers. 

 Yours faithfully,

Mahelaka Begum, Calcutta

 Happiness mantra

 Sir Dont worry, be happy and live longer (Dec 24) is a call to build up a will to survive, live a long and meaningful life. Among the many other things, there are ten easy ways to enhance ones quality of life: daily workouts, not smoking, owning pets, eating wisely, having good friends, laughing, being positive, meditation, relaxation, and yoga. Being nice does make one last longer than the ones who are not. Optimism strengthens ones defences against disease and death. Keeping pets lowers blood pressure, increases self-esteem in children, decreases cholesterol and depression, relieves stress, and adds to the family spirit. Good friends increase the zest for living. Old people having close friends live much longer. Laughter decreases the secretion of stress-related hormones. Those who are giving and helpful outlive the selfish. 

 Yours faithfully,

Tuli Das, Calcutta

 Sir Dev Anands picture beside the anchor piece of December 24 is ample evidence of optimism. Even with a string of flops, he is as enthusiastic about life as ever. It is not surprising that he is often referred to as the evergreen star. But one wonders what would happen if such optimism turns out to be a kind of complacency. If one does not accept failures and reversals, from where will one get the inspiration to succeed? 

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir It made me sad to read about the death of five-year-old Vijay Pal of Madhya Pradesh, who, unlike Prince, did not survive the 125-feet fall down a dry-bore well (Prince rerun, minus the happy ending, Dec 25). Why have deep holes been left open and unmarked in the middle of fields? Their owners should either fill up or barricade them properly. The irresponsible owner in this case should be punished, so that such accidents do not recur. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.K. Ghosh, Calcutta

 UNCERTAINTIES DOG NUCLEAR DEAL

 Twenty-Twenty 

/ Bharat Bhushan

 Party?s over

 Barely three days before the visit of President George. W Bush there is no certainty about the India-US civilian nuclear cooperation agreement. Although both sides still see the agreement as the centrepiece of the visit, new difficulties are cropping up even in the run-up to it.

 President Bush?s speech at the Asia Society has not made matters any easier. He has reiterated what was till then only a demand made by state department officials that the Indian plan for separation of civilian and military nuclear facilities be ?credible, transparent and defensible?. He has raised the demand to a political level and thus modified the basis of the July 18 joint statement.

 This is contrary to the spirit of what was understood by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. He told parliament last year that the separation would be phased, voluntary, all commitments would be reciprocal and that India would not accept any discrimination. 

 The July 18 statement talked of India being in the same category as other states which have ?advanced nuclear technology?. It talked of India assuming the same responsibilities and practices and ?acquire the same benefits and advantages as other leading countries with advanced nuclear technology, such as the United States.?

 But Bush was talking a different language at the Asia Society. He spoke of two categories of nations under his Global Nuclear Energy Partnership. In the first category, besides the United States of America, are those ?nations that have advanced civilian nuclear programme ? such as Great Britain, France, Japan and Russia?. In the second are ?nations like India that are developing a civilian nuclear energy programme.?

 The US president went on to suggest that while the first category of nations could be trusted to reprocess nuclear waste into fuel, countries like India could not be. They would have to send their waste fuel under the GNEP programme for reprocessing to the Category One Brahmin nations: ?The supplier nations will collect the spent fuel. And the supplier nations will invest in new methods to reprocess the spent fuel so that it can be used for advanced new reactors?.

 Contrary to its name, the GNEP, then, is not about partnership but about selling ? first selling the fuel, then shipping the waste fuel back for reprocessing and then selling it once again to ?partners? like India.

 There is also a subtext over and above these commercial considerations. India has a fully developed nuclear cycle. The waste fuel from the Russian-supplied Kudankulam nuclear power plant is fully safeguarded and India is already reprocessing it under the guidelines of the International Atomic Energy Agency. President Bush is now suggesting that while India may not be exactly like Iran, it was still on the ?other side? ? it would not be allowed to reprocess even safeguarded fuel.

 The July 18 statement was not about India?s desire to buy nuclear fuel. It was about access to natural uranium and civilian nuclear reactors. Uranium availability in India has not kept pace with expansion in reactor capacity. India has never been in the international market for nuclear fuel. Now it is being lured through GNEP, which is about selling nuclear fuel to countries like India.

 India?s expectation has been that any new nuclear power plant set up with international help will come with guarantees of a lifecycle supply of natural uranium. Learning from the Tarapur experience, India cannot accept a deal without guarantees of lifecycle uranium supply again.

 What is becoming increasingly clear, however, is that the US and Indian bottom lines on nuclear cooperation are different. India has made its bottom line public through the lengthy interview of Anil Kakodkar, chairman of department of atomic energy. He has set the yardstick against which negotiations will be conducted.

 If the US shifts its bottom line, as is being suggested in the case of the fast breeder reactors, then the question is how would this impact the Bush administration?s attempts to get the US congress on board? There are strong lobbies within the US congress and outside it, which do not favour civilian nuclear cooperation with India because of non-proliferation considerations.

 The only effective answer to congressional criticism is for the Bush administration to claim that it has frozen India?s nuclear weapons capability. To do that, it must cap India?s fissile material production (which can be diverted for making weapons) and ensure that henceforth, fissile material will be produced under international control. That is why it seems implausible that the US would agree not to put the FBR programme under the civilian category for five or even ten years. Fast breeders produce fuel for power plants but the plutonium they produce can also be used for making weapons.

 Yet another issue relates to the future of the existing Indian stockpile of nuclear waste which can also be used to make weapons. US non-proliferation experts want even that to be put under safeguards. This is a tricky issue, as Indian nuclear waste requires a cooling period of five years during which it is kept in water pools.

 If India agrees to subject its waste stockpile to international safeguards, then whatever has been produced in the past five years cannot even be touched. So even this has become a technical issue of some import. The nuclear cooperation with the US has also been unnecessarily shrouded in secrecy ? creating the impression that the Indian leadership wants to concede more than what is admitted. There has been no sustained attempt to be accountable to the political class cutting across party lines and to the scientific community whose blood, sweat and tears have propelled India to being a nuclear power. Instead, there is a seeming encouragement for attacks on the department of atomic energy and the scientific community by strategic analysts. That some of them occupy important positions on the government?s policy advisory bodies indicate an unholy connivance for these attacks.

 What is amazing is that no one has risen to the defence of the nuclear scientists ? not even the prime minister?s office. If nuclear cooperation with the US is really a national enterprise, then this is hardly the way to go about it. One gets the impression that the Indian political leadership of the day somehow wants to reach an agreement and present it as the high point of the Bush visit. The Bharatiya Janata Party has also given the government the breathing space it needs by not being overly critical.

 The manner in which the obligations of the US administration to the US congress are being prioritized over obligations to Indian parliament suggests that the Manmohan Singh- government wants a deal almost at any cost. Therefore, there is a fair chance that an agreement on the separation of India?s civilian and military nuclear facilities may well take place during the Bush visit based on a ?political? decision. In parliament, the government perhaps does not expect anything more than a symbolic scoring of points by the opposition and it thinks it can live with that.

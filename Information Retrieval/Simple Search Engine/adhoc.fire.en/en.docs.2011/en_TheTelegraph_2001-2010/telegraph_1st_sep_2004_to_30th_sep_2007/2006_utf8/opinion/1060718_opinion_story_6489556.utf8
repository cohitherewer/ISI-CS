 FOR THE SIMPLEST DEMANDS

 Malvika Singh

 There was a time when the quality of our political debate, during the sittings of the Constituent Assembly, was spirited and sophisticated. Our leaders were committed, thinking, and able to debate and participate in an intellectual discourse that led to many a consensus but also some sharp differences. Today, there appears to be a frightening lacuna in that space. It is the primary reason for the societal degradation that confronts us, that has diluted ethics and values, integrity and dignity. The dumbing down of our leadership and our bureaucracy has had a very negative impact on India, Indians and on development processes. It has let down a patient populace that wants government to allow it to function without having to be bogged down by red tape and corruption. It is a legitimate demand, a peaceful one that is not politically volatile, one that has remained unfulfilled for nearly 60 years. It is a shocking, shameful truth.

 When you look at the Central government ministries, you find that each is operating on its own, doing what its minister wants, all out of sync with the greater whole. It is much like an orchestra with a flautist, a cello player, drummers, two violinists, all of whom are taking off in different directions, emanating shrill, out-of-tune notes that create a cacophony rather than a symphony. Ramadoss, Arjun Singh, Kamal Nath, P. Chidambaram, Pranab Mukherjee, all able individuals, and the one and only weak loyalist, Shivraj Patil. It is a scary scene for any intelligent citizen: the lack of cohesive policy bereft of social commitment and a weak leadership unable to even address the nation with passion. Is anyone in complete control? That is the fear.

 End of patience

 It is very disturbing to find that the prime minister and his advisors are delaying talks with Pakistan because of blasts in Mumbai and in Kashmir. Surely they comprehend that they are playing straight into the hands of ?terrorists? and ?militants? who are determined to stall all peace initiatives and who feel victorious with New Delhi?s reaction, which is what they have been waiting for.

 Manmohan Singh did not fall prey to this advice earlier, but alas, he seems to have succumbed to bureaucratic thinking-in-the-box. This country has a plethora of thinkers, creative intellectuals, who must be brought in to advise, to think out new strategies for the peace process.

 Why has the prime minister allowed himself to be isolated from the intellectual energy of India? Why has he become a seeming pawn in the hands of uninspired bureaucrats? 

 Why does he follow archaic thinking and permit his good sense to take a backseat? Has he given up on his hitherto number one mission ? peace across the border? Has this good man, with integrity and nationalism, just plain given up? It is a sad commentary on the realities that confront India. Where is the ?dynamism? that was so much a part of Indian politics where challenges were met with determined dedication?

 In the old days, when prime ministers had to keep specific individuals in the cabinet for various political reasons and not because they were the right people for the right job, and when an embarrassing situation arose in a ministry over policy, the prime minister usually reshuffled the portfolios. This was a peaceful and diplomatic, albeit uninspired, way of dealing with controversial situations without ?rocking the boat?. That has not happened with two rather vociferous ministers who have walked roughshod over their terrain much like dictators, unwilling to debate and discourse.

 Sadness and fear are emotions that do not give constituents a sense of security or confidence. India is patient and tolerates many political contortions but equally it expects the government to rise to its task and perform.

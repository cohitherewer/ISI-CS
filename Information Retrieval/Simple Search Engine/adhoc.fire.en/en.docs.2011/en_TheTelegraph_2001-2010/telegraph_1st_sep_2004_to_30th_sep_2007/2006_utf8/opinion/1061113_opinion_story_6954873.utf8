 TRUTH ABOUT GAFFES

 GWYNNE DYER

 A gaffe is a true statement that outrages the hypocrites, who then mobilize to shut the truth-teller up. The most common gaffes are about politics and religion, because those are the areas where the level of hypocrisy is highest. Which explains John Kerrys problem on October 31, or why Muazzez Ilmiye Cig almost went to jail in Turkey the next day.

 John Kerry inadvertently spoke the truth about why some people end up in the US armed forces while others do not. Speaking to students in California, he said: You know, education, if you make the most of it, you study hard...you can do well. If you dont, you get stuck in Iraq.

 Cue mass outrage. How dare Kerry suggest that people might be in the US army because they lacked the education for softer, safer, better-paying jobs, or indeed might have joined precisely to get that missing education? No, they are all there solely because they are patriots, and anybody who says differently will be spanked soundly and sent to bed without supper.

 The Republicans leaped on Kerrys remark as a golden opportunity to paint the Democrats as unpatriotic and disloyal to the armed forces. And yet Kerrys remark was entirely true. The Pentagons own figures show that only 10 per cent of American enlisted troops have any post-secondary education, whereas 56 per cent of the general population does. It has been true since Sargon of Akkad created the worlds first regular army over four thousand years ago: its mostly poor who join the army, because the rich have better options. The military themselves recognize this in their recruiting ads, which stress the opportunities for further education during or after military service. Its obvious, but you are not allowed to say it plainly in public.

 Fearless voices

 More admirable than Kerry, because her gaffe was deliberate and she refused to apologize, is Muazzez Ilmiye Cig, a 92-year-old Turkish archaeologist who said that the hijab is not Islamic at all, but a 5,000-year-old Middle Eastern tradition.

 The great thing about being 92 one of the few good things about being 92, apart from not being dead yet is that you no longer have to care about your career or what people think. As one of the worlds leading experts on Sumer, the first civilization, Cig published thirteen books and dozens of scholarly articles on her subject and earned great respect within that small community. But then she published a book, My Reactions as a Citizen, last year, about her own convictions and all hell broke loose in Turkey.

 All she said was that the head-scarf, now a badge of Muslim identity, was actually first worn 5000 years ago by temple priestesses in Sumeria whose job was to initiate the young into sex. They were not prostitutes; only the daughters of the rich and influential got temple jobs. So gradually the wearing of head-scarves came to designate respectable women; not peasants and slaves. The fashion persisted down to Greek and Roman times, and was picked up by the Arabs when they conquered Syria in the generation after the Prophet.

 Well, I could have told her that. I grew up a Catholic in prelapsarian Newfoundland, and the nuns who taught my sisters wore the full Sumerian gear. Until a couple of decades ago, Catholic nuns still dressed like any respectable Middle Eastern woman (of any religion) of a few thousand years ago. Muazzez Ilmiye Cig was just stating the obvious historical truth. A serious gaffe.

 So Islamist lawyers brought charges against her for inciting hatred and enmity among the people, and she ended up in court facing imprisonment. But 25 lawyers came to defend her for free, and the state prosecutor asked the judge to drop the charges. Soon she walked out of the court a free woman, cheered by the crowd that had come to support her. The hypocrites do not always win.

 NEW VISION

 By any measure, it is Bengals biggest leap forward into the future. The state governments agreement with the Salim group of Indonesia and two Indian private companies for a multifaceted infrastructure project has a truly historic potential. In its vision and scope, the project is unprecedented not just in Bengal but anywhere in India. Two special economic zones spread over 22,000 acres of land, big and small industrial hubs, a clutch of new townships to be built over another 10,000 acres, expressways, a new-age bridge over the Hooghly and several other infrastructural facilities can make it the biggest-ever agent of change for Bengal and the eastern region. Nothing of this scale has ever been attempted or visualized in India. Given the slow pace of governmental work in India, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and his industries minister, Mr Nirupam Sen, have achieved an enormous success by steering the project to this stage in less than a year. Many had doubted the Salim groups commitment to the project and the governments ability to give it a concrete shape when the chief minister signed a memorandum of understanding for it in Jakarta in July last year. Irrespective of how the implementation of the project goes over the projected 15 years, the signing of the agreement is a testimony to Mr Bhattacharjees vision of a new Bengal. There have been other examples of the investors growing faith in Bengal. But this agreement alone could change the states investment climate dramatically. 

 However, a project of this scale can also cause social and political upheavals. The new facilities will come up mostly on land that is now used for agriculture. The project will, therefore, lead to the displacement of thousands of people not only from their sources of livelihood but also from their social and cultural roots. If the events at Singur, where an automobile project of the Tata group is to come up, are any indication, the New Kolkata International Development Project could be up against much opposition. It is not enough that the government plans compensation and rehabilitation packages. Large projects in India often become unpopular because of the governments lack of will and inability to implement the rehabilitation plans effectively. Also, there will be doubters, some within the ruling left front. Hopefully, small minds will not be able to kill a big idea.

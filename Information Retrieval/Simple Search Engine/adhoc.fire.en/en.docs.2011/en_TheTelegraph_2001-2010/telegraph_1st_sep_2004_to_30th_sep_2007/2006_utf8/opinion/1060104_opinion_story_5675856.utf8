 TUNNEL VISION 

 Contrary to the trend abroad, students 

 in India?s top business schools seem overly concerned with 

 job placements, writes Arkadev Chatterjea 

 Aiming high 

 One of the 60 students in my financial 

 engineering and risk management course at IIM Calcutta got 

 a plum job at a European branch of a renowned international 

 bank and asked me to be his referee. Normally, this would 

 be a pleasant duty. But I politely declined, stating that 

 since he had put little effort into the course and got the 

 lowest grade, he would be better off with other professors. 

 He also got one of the lowest grades in a colleague?s course. 

 The student is pleasant, intelligent, has a solid background. 

 What went wrong? Is it what we teach or how we teach? My 

 colleague is a popular teacher and I generally get good 

 student course evaluations. Why did he put little effort 

 into the course? It?s hard to tell. I think it has much 

 to do with the purposes of education, the common admission 

 test, the selection process and a culture where success 

 is counted in terms of placements.

 There are at least three purposes 

 of education. The first is connected with what we think 

 about an educated person who has ?general education? or 

 ?liberal arts education.? In The University: An Owner?s 

 Manual, Harvard University emeritus professor Henry 

 Rosovsky suggests that an educated person must be able to 

 think and write clearly and effectively. Second, he should 

 have a critical appreciation of the ways in which we gain 

 knowledge and understanding of the universe, of society, 

 and of ourselves. Three, he should not be ignorant of other 

 cultures and other times. Four, he should have some understanding 

 of moral and ethical problems, and five, he should have 

 achieved depth in some field of knowledge. Indian colleges 

 do not offer general education. IIMs try to do that, but 

 tend to overburden students who take double the number of 

 courses than an MBA student in America. Thus, attention 

 falters and time for a course shrinks.

 A second purpose of education 

 is to acquire useful skills and professional credentials. 

 MBA is a fairly expensive way of doing that. A third purpose 

 is ?job market signalling.? Stanford University emeritus 

 professor Michael Spence suggested that education can signal 

 ?productivity? to potential employers. You may signal your 

 abilities by passing punishingly difficult examinations 

 (say, JEE) and successfully completing a demanding course 

 of study (say, chartered accountancy). A credible signal 

 must be costly to do, easy to see, and hard to mimic. And 

 this is where the CAT and the IIMs come in.

 I surveyed my first year IIM students 

 on this. A majority clamoured ?signalling?; a significant 

 minority indicated professional training; and very few favoured 

 liberal arts education. So it is jobs, jobs, jobs! If you 

 go to IIM, you will get good jobs. To get into IIM you have 

 to ?crack? the CAT. It?s a devilishly difficult exam, where 

 people scoring a small fraction of the total marks get calls. 

 If it?s a bad day ? the light is too dim or the room is 

 too hot? get a few answers wrong, and your rank will slide 

 down. Yes, IIMs subsequently screen students, but the fate 

 is sealed ? each IIM typically focuses on the top 1,000 

 to 1,500 students for about a thousand seats. Group discussion 

 and interviews rearranges the lucky few.

 India is not alone. Many countries 

 including Britain, France and Japan favour a single entrance 

 examination. It is cheap, easy to administer, and gives 

 the impression of fairness. But is it the best method? Is 

 it consistent with the way arts and science advances ? a 

 group of disinterested professionals pushing the boundaries 

 of knowledge forward? In this case, it would mean an admissions 

 committee with a healthy representation of faculty members 

 unbiasedly evaluating the potential of an applicant and 

 admitting him on the basis of the best interests of the 

 institution and society. American universities select students 

 this way. An applicant is evaluated on the basis of the 

 reputation of the institution where he studied before, academic 

 performance, standardized test scores, recommendation letters, 

 statement of purpose, interviews, committee?s vision of 

 composition of an ideal incoming class, selector?s biases 

 and so on. IIMs admit doctoral students this way.

 Who gets in? Rosovsky suggests 

 that US colleges and universities favour categories of students 

 like the highly-talented (top schools fight for them), alumni 

 and faculty children, students from well-known institutions, 

 those who would help achieve a national and international 

 representation, under-represented ethnic minorities, women 

 applicants, special talents (athletes, writers, singers), 

 students interested in diverse fields of study, and so on. 

 Ability to pay is not a major constraint as students are 

 offered financial aid. Corruption does not seem to be a 

 major problem either ? yes, diplomat children get in, but 

 you cannot influence all members of the admission committee. 

 After the students are admitted, 

 they have to distinguish themselves in an extremely competitive 

 environment. IIM students fiercely compete in the early 

 part of the programme. The slack begins after a cut-off 

 date beyond which the grades are not reported to potential 

 employers. Everything becomes placement driven. A colleague 

 explained that students have been trained to think in terms 

 of coaching help: school students take tuition to go to 

 engineering schools, the latter take coaching to go to top 

 management schools, and management school students seek 

 courses that would help them get good jobs. Where is the 

 time or need for serious academic study? IIM students also 

 have a database of courses, ranked in terms of how they 

 are going to help in the job placements.

 This is an alarming situation. 

 As the number of students taking the CAT is skyrocketing, 

 admission is increasingly becoming a lottery game and student 

 quality is falling. Of course, there are many bright students 

 who are serious about studies. But the concern is about 

 a significant section of students which seems to be steadily 

 growing. During the four years that I have taught my course 

 in Calcutta, the numbers penalized for heavy absences slowly 

 crept up. 

 What about elsewhere? Although 

 many of them had multiple job offers, the MBA students I 

 taught at Indiana University, Bloomington, would regularly 

 come to class. And when I was teaching at Cornell?s business 

 school, there were some 110 students in the class, including 

 a group of some 12 to 15 Japanese students. Polite and inquisitive, 

 they would pleasantly ask the professor if they didn?t understand 

 something. The course grade was 50 per cent for a take-home 

 project and 50 per cent for a final examination. Nearly 

 everyone did well in the project. But these were the dying 

 days of their last semester and many of them eased up. Only 

 some Asian students scored above 100 in a 120 point final 

 exam. That?s the global arena and it is tough out there.

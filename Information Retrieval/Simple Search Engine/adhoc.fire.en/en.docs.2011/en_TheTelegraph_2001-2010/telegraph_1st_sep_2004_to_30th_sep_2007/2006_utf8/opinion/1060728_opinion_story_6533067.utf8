The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 BY THE WAYSIDE

 It is always the weakest link that ultimately makes nonsense of the most impressive enterprises. And the weakest link, amid the boom and glitter of business process outsourcing in Bangalore as in other success stories elsewhere, is women?s safety. It is a pitiful irony that women, on the one hand, are working in greater numbers, earning eye-catching salaries, and spending unconventional hours in offices often situated in other states or cities. Like Tanya Banerjee from West Bengal, who died of multiple stab wounds on a highway some distance from Bangalore after having left her workplace around nine in the evening. Therefore, on the other hand, this change in women?s quality of life, recognized as empowerment, seems to have made them into easier prey for violent criminals. Women have forged ahead, but the administration has not been able to keep pace. It has not been able to create an environment in which women can work and move about with a sense of security, knowing that any threat to their safety will be ruthlessly confronted and criminals punished severely. To a cynical observation, this lack may seem intentional. Inadequate safety would not only strengthen society?s tendency to confine women ? in the name of their own good, of course ? but could also undermine the confidence of women themselves.

 Bangalore is a case in point. The city has turned in recent years into an island of hi-tech development in the midst of backwardness, peopled by high-earning, high-spending young people from other parts of the country. Yet not much change has taken place in its law-keeping systems: the fact that crime thrives in areas with unequal development and migrant populations did not seem to mean much in law-keeping terms. So Pratibha Srikanta Murthy was raped and killed by the driver of the car she was in on her way to work a few months ago, and numerous other men and women have complained of cellphone and credit card robberies, even of beatings and threats. There has been a 75 per cent increase in the crime rate since 2004, yet it took Srikanta Murthy?s death for companies to tighten their pick-up and drop-off systems and for the police to acknowledge they had a problem on their hands. Providing a reasonable degree of security is not all that difficult. Neither is it optional. All it requires is the willingness to deal with a changing world and to acknowledge that women play a big part in it.

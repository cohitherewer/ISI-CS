 DIVIDED WE LEARN

 Ardhendu Chatterjee

 The British prime minister, Tony Blair, is eager to experiment with new ideas in education reforms. Blair wants schools to introduce ? setting? under which students are to be taught in different groups depending on their ability. Blair?s colleagues have supported the move by arguing that mixed ability classes do not help either weaker students or intelligent ones.

 However, this move has been widely criticized at some quarters. Margaret Drabble, a biographer and novelist, thinks that setting may cause ?lasting bitterness? among pupils in lower groups. Writing in Report, Drabble says ?Clever children in a heavily streamed school may benefit in the short term in the grades...but they often lose out in skills...Education is...a collaborative undertaking: it should teach to navigate as well as score. And good friends across the social spectrum are worth as much as higher grades.?

 Back home, the Maharashtra government?s recent directive to schools in the state to stop the practice of segregating students on the basis of marks has revived the same debate over the pedagogic practice of tracking. The state education department has eventually bowed to the mounting pressure exerted by a number of pressure groups against ability-grouping. The pressure groups regard the directive as a vindication of their views.

 Both the supporters and critics of this principle agree that gifted children benefit most from tracking and between-class grouping. Normally, students with a higher IQ would like to be put in a class where there is stiff competition. They lose interest in a heterogeneous class with the teacher devoting most of the time to slow learners. They also find it difficult to focus on the lessons with which they are already familiar. Those placed in low-end tracks are not comfortable in the company of more talented classmates. But, strangely, once segregated and placed in a homogeneous group, they feel a little let down.

 The right step

 The practice of between-class grouping or ability grouped class assignment should theoretically help both meritorious and weak students. Under such an arrangement, learners are given the same module of lessons in keeping with their performance levels. Mobility of learners from a low-end track to a high-end one is permitted when there is a perceptible improvement in performance. But this arrangement too sometimes fails to produce desired results.

 An alternative method envisages segregation of students into multiple ?cooperative learning groups in heterogeneous classrooms?. It allows pupils to learn their lessons in a spirit of cooperation rather than of competition to reach the same standard of attainment. Combined with different traditional tracking practices, and supported by remedial teaching, this method enables a teacher to impart lessons most effectively in a heterogeneous class. Flexibility being the key, teachers are free to regroup learners according to the interests of their pupils. 

 State or Central government schools in India incorporate discriminatory practices by admitting students through written tests, without realizing that those who fail the tests have nowhere else to go. The parliament tried to implement the common school system as envisaged by the Kothari commission thrice, but the bill was stalled on each occasion on one pretext or another. Abolishing grouping practices altogether will not help in any way. It may deprive gifted children of the kind of learning environment they badly need. It may not be a blessing for slow learners either. And to describe ability-grouping as?casteism?, ?academic apartheid?, ?gross human rights violation?, and so on, as the pressure groups in Maharashtra have done, is to stretch it beyond the purview of educational principles.

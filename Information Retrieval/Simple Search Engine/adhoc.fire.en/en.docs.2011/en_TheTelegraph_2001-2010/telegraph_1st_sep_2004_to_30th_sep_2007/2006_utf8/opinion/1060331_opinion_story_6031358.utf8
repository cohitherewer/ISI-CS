 Ladies in the driving seat

 My Sainted Aunts (Penguin, Rs 200) 

by Bulbul Sharma could easily be one of the best books to come out of India 

this year. For those brought up on the tales of formidable Bengali women by Lila 

Majumdar and Ashapurna Devi, Bulbul Sharma?s aunts bring back the world of Cantheridine 

oil, starched, white cotton saris and obsession with hygiene. The opening story, 

?Mayadevi?s London Yatra?, chronicles the saga of the matriarch?s visit to her 

eldest son in London. (The son had sailed there to study forty years ago, but 

a fear of flying had prevented him from making a trip back home.) Another aunt 

wasted no time in deciding to go to Nagpur and find a job as soon as her husband 

left home to become a holy man. Yet another had the course of life altered when 

her husband?s family came to fetch her from her parent?s home once she reached 

puberty: the child bride had grown ?a clear six inches taller? than her husband 

in the intervening period. Sharma?s narration is simple, lucid and full of the 

old-world charm that is hard to find in new-age Indian writing.

 A Woman of Cairo (Hodder, ? 3.50) by Noel Barber was first 

published in 1984 and has been reprinted now as part of the Hodder Great Reads 

series, which celebrates ?the best and most-loved popular classics of the 20th 

century?. Serena Pasha is the daughter of a diplomat in Cairo in the Twenties 

and Thirties, the last days of the Empire in Egypt. Mark and Greg Holt are sons 

of the Egyptian adviser, a throwback to the times when Britain believed ?that 

Egypt was incapable of governing itself?. Mark and Serena grow up together and 

fall in love, but it is Mark?s brother who has been promised Serena?s hand. The 

approach to the Second World War and the armed attempts by the Egyptian nationalist 

forces to overthrow the British rulers make the novel a pacy and engrossing read. 

Not to be forgotten are the beautifully-woven-in characters of King Farouk, Anwar 

Sadat and Nasser ? the result of the author?s own interactions with them. 

 Clueless and co. (Rupa, Rs 195) by 

Pratik Basu adds one more to the corpus of forgettable Indian English novels, 

primarily written by people taking sabbaticals from successful careers in industry 

or media. Pratik Basu, an IIM Calcutta alumnus ?from a time when batch numbers 

were still in single digits?, is contemplating extending his sabbatical indefinitely. 

His novel is set in corporate Calcutta of the Eighties, and written in the jocular, 

irreverent mode that has become a trademark of almost all ?first? novels today. 

No prizes for guessing that the author?s corporate, B-school experience becomes 

fodder for his debut novel. 

Smoked (Review, ? 6.00) by Patrick 

Quinlan begins with two con men trying to overpower and rape Lola. She is 

25 and has already been gangraped at 16. This time, however, she gets the better 

of Mr Shaggy and Mr Blue Eyes, and the episode portends more violence, Tarantino 

style. The hero, Smoke Dugan, is a bomb-maker, and Lola Bell turns out to be his 

girlfriend. But Denny Cruz, the hitman, is out to get Smoke, and decides to use 

Lola for the purpose. What follows is a breathless sequence of abduction, car 

chases and con jobs. Just what the doctor ordered for a Hollywood flick.

 Maximum Ride: The Angel Experiment (Headline, 

? 2.99) by James Patterson takes you on a ride from Death Valley, California, 

to the bowels of the New York subway system, with Max, Fang, Iggy, Nudge, the 

Gasman and Angel. A fantasy ? Angel and co. are 98 per cent human and 2 per cent 

bird ? with plenty of resonances from urban neighbourhoods.

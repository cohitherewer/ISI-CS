 MUSICAL INDIA

 Britain is a neat little country with very few people living in it. And in spite of multiculturalism, social mobility and politically correct class-guilt wreaking havoc with accents, charting the economics and sociology of British musical taste is a relatively sweet and simple affair. Hence a Leicester professors survey of his own societys listening habits has confirmed some stereotypes. Listeners of opera and classical music are wealthier and more educated, while fans of rap are more likely to commit crime. With findings like the latter, a warning light starts blinking because one stereotype rests on other, more pernicious, ones. The typecasting of rap (and hip-hop) often goes hand-in-hand with racial stereotyping. Besides, only 25,000 people have responded to this survey, which, even by British standards, is rather a small number. 

 The challenge for such a survey would be to include a country like India. First, what would then be a representative survey, given the immense numbers? How would rural India, for instance, respond to an internet-based survey? Yet, would not such a survey be nonsensical without taking into account what the uncomputered millions listen to? The scale of popular, and subaltern, consumption of music through radio, television and cinema in south Asia could seriously unsettle a British ethno-musicologist relying mainly on the internet for gathering material for his study. An invaluable world of data will be beyond his reach. And with something like Hindi or south Indian film music, any kind of facile social mapping will simply not do, for music is often the great leveller in the sub-continent, and tastes remain constant across economic strata and over long periods of time. Lata Mangeshkar has been around for a very long time, and her fans, in a city like Mumbai, would include someone like Bina Ramani as well as the humblest Dharavian, and the entire range in-between. Is it possible, then, to work out an internet-based socio-economic map of the full range of music consumption in the sub-continent without making methodological and analytical blunders? Yet, the making, recording, packaging and consumption of music, even in the sub-continent, are now part of a rapidly evolving market. And markets mean trends, trends mean surveys, and surveys would mean gross generalizations when it comes to music, for so much of it vitally exists outside such organized markets in India.

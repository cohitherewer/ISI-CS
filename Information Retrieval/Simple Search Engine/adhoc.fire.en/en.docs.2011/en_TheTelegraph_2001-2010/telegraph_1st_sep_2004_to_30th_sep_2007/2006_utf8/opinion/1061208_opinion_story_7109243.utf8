 JUST DESERTS

 Few would doubt the exemplariness of Shibu Sorens career in politics. If the bribery scandal involving him and his partymen exposed the venality of Indias political leadership, the murder trial against him has shown its moral abjection. His conviction and the life sentence against him the first such judgment against an incumbent minister in independent India are perhaps even more educative. They prove, more conclusively than ever before, that holders of public office in this country are neither above the law, nor are they invincible. This reality has been further confirmed by the Supreme Courts recent ruling that dispenses with the need for sanction from the requisite government authorities every time a public servant has to be tried for criminal and other penal offences. The verdict was passed by the apex court while setting aside the objections of several of the countrys high-profile legislators to prosecution for corruption charges. On the face of it, this may seem a reiteration of Article 14 of the Constitution that grants equality before the law. However, the fact that it allows for the doing away of the immunity granted to public office-holders under Section 19(1) of the Prevention of Corruption Act and Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure in most cases except those which have a correlation to their official duties, will go a long way in bringing back probity in public life. 

 The ruling can be seen as part of the apex courts ongoing attempt to sort out the judicial procedure concerning public servants. In deserving cases, it has struck down the single directive that assures bureaucrats immunity and has qualified governors right to grant sanction to the prosecution of chief ministers. Such activism, quite obviously, has not been viewed with much kindness by the executive, which has always found itself at the wrong end of the stick. But in a country where constitutional safeguards are distorted to warrant unqualified access to power and public office becomes a ticket to justify corruption and crime of the worst kind, such judicial interventionism, no matter how unwelcome, becomes necessary.

 The knowledge that ministers, judges, civil servants, et al, can be made accountable cannot be a self-sufficient tool by itself in the hands of the public. India will continue to be the only democracy in the world to require sanctions for proceeding against its public servants as part of the legal immunity will remain in place (and probably add to the confusion). More important, the people will have to remain dependent on the integrity of the investigating agencies, the police, and, ultimately, the will, ability and independence of the public prosecutor to deliver just deserts to the likes of Shibu Soren.

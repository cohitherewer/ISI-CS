The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 PEOPLES POISON

 Something as banal as breathing clean air is obviously not a priority in Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Resurgent Bengal. Otherwise, why should Calcuttans be repeatedly denied that most basic of biological necessities, and by none other than the state government? Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai every other Indian metropolis has managed to control vehicular pollution and clear its air, to a significant extent, of the various poisons damaging the health of its citizens. But not Calcutta. The Left Front government its current chief minister together with its various transport ministers have, till date, not managed to implement any of the new anti-pollution laws and regulations that the judiciary has tried to enforce over the last few years. The courts have been forced into an increasingly helpless activism by a criminally callous, inefficient and mendacious state government. It has now revoked its ban on three-wheelers that are more than ten years old and have not converted to liquid petroleum gas. And its declared rationale is either a piece of fiction or, if true, a measure of the extent of its failings in this matter.

 For the transport secretary to say that the ban could not be implemented because there are not enough LPG outlets in the city is to beg the question. It is precisely here in creating enough LPG outlets and strictly monitoring the conversion that the other cities, most notably Delhi, have made a substantial difference. A sustained political will has been the most important determining factor for their success. The transport department in Bengal has claimed repeatedly that the socio-economic situation in Calcutta is different from the other cities, hence the need to have a different set of rules, no matter what the consequences. This has now begun to sound so much like a lame excuse for political populism and inertia that very few people actually believe it is anything else. LPG outlets do not exist because the government does not want them to. And the government does not want them to because it cannot afford to have the autorickshaw unions up in arms against it. This is simple and shameful, given that most LPG suppliers are eager to set up shop in the city once demand increases. What is most shocking is that Calcuttans have begun to believe in a vision for their city which thrillingly combines boundless development and filthy air.

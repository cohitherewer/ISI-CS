The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 ANOTHER CULT

 Discrimination is one of the classic weapons of power. It makes no difference if the power is held by a temple trust. The administration of the Balaji temple in Tirupati has ruled that no religion other than Hinduism can be preached in the vast area around the temple which the Tirupati-Tirumala Dewasthanam controls. This outright violation of a constitutional guarantee has been ostensibly prompted by the allegation that Christian missionaries were distributing pamphlets close to Tirumala, which houses temple workers. The reaction may be rooted either in extreme insecurity or in extreme aggressiveness, but the psychology is irrelevant. It is the intimate complicity between religion and state that is far more revealing. For the Dewasthanam?s reaction has not stopped here. It has declared a ban on the building of churches or mosques in the same area ? a harsh reminder of the ugliest face of majoritarianism ? and has forbidden non-Hindus to either enter the temple for worship or be employed in its service. This is an extension of casteism, which banned entry of ?lower? castes to temples, and a defiant display of power, both of which directly contradict the spirit of the cult from which the deity was born. 

 Power finds it own rhythm, and its own self-serving logic. Non-Hindu VIPs will be allowed to enter, although only after they have signed a declaration that they have faith in Hinduism. This is not as moronic ? or presumptious ? as it looks. Important persons provide publicity, contacts and wealth; this is not something the Dewasthanam will give up. It nurtures the VIP cult, obliging the state, for example, to resettle the hereditary residents of Tirumala to acquire their property for the temple. This is not merely indecency in god?s name, it is a spectacular violation of principles of democracy and secularism. And the state seems to find no problem in supporting it.

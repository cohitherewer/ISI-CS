 LAND RITES

 In economic terms, farming is hardly the best use of land. Even farmers who depend on land for their livelihood are compelled to do so because they know no better use of land. Land being the most limited of economic resources, its most profitable use must be at the heart of all plans for economic development. This larger logic is being ignored in the debate over the Bengal government?s decision to acquire agricultural land for the Tata group?s proposed automobile unit at Singur. For all the advances it made in agriculture in recent decades, Bengal?s economy did not grow fast or large enough mainly because of the state?s inability to move toward industrialization. Land cannot sustain the economic needs of an expanding population. And the inability to use land for other economic activities prevents the farmers from graduating to other livelihoods. Any opposition to the use of agricultural land for industrialization, therefore, is devoid of basic economic logic. It is also unfair to the farmers? own economic mobility. Bengal actually needs more and more land to be put to industrial use. In the recent elections, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee won a massive mandate on precisely this economic agenda. 

 It cannot be anyone?s case that the farmers? interests are irrelevant to the demands of an industrialized economy. At Singur or any other place, the people who lose land to an industrial project have their right to economic rehabilitation. All state governments offer monetary compensation and other rehabilitation packages to the land-losers. There are laws that make it obligatory for the governments to offer such packages. It is another matter that administrative inefficiency and a lack of political will often lead to avoidable complications. But Bengal?s commerce and industries minister, Mr Nirupam Sen, is right in rejecting the demand that the people be given jobs in the industrial units which come up on their land. The jobs created in any such project obviously depend on the nature of the industry. Unfortunately, most of the dissenters over the Tata project are driven only by populist motives. Ms Mamata Banerjee, of course, has to oppose anything and everything that Mr Bhattacharjee proposes. Clearly, she has not taken any lessons from the people?s total rejection of her negative politics in the assembly polls. Mr Bhattacharjee must not allow such spoilers to cloud Bengal?s new economic hopes.

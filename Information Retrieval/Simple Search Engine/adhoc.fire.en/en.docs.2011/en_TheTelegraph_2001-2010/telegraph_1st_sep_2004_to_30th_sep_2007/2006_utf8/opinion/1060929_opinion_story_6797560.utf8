 Letters to Editor

 Misplaced trust

 Sir Although the meeting between Manmohan Singh and Pervez Musharraf during the NAM summit in Havana is being hailed as a success, it may not serve Indias interests (Mohabbat in Havana air, Sept 17). Singhs failure to compel Pakistan to demolish all terrorist camps on the other side of the border reflects his weak personality. Musharraf, on the other hand, appears to be miles ahead in diplomacy. The decision to have a joint counter-terrorism offensive will only give Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence access to secret information kept by the Intelligence Bureau and the Research and Analysis Wing. Shaking hands or having joint discussions on Kashmir is not enough. Neither is it wise to enter into hasty agreements. India should recognize Pakistan for what it is. It will never adopt steps to serve Indias interest, or stop funding terrorists. India should also come to terms with the fact that winning over his Pakistani counterpart in a battle of nerves is not Singhs cup of tea. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shubhankar Ghosh, Bolpur

 Sir Pervez Musharraf is a shrewd politician and Manmohan Singh, a simple man. Perhaps that is why Indias foreign ministry has clarified that there is no basic change in the policy towards Pakistan, even though both countries signed a joint anti-terror pact. Pakistans president has his own set of rules while dealing with India on matters that involve al Qaida and Dawood Ibrahim. The rules dramatically change with respect to the outfits when he confronts them as an ally of the Western powers. The media have often reported on the innumerable terrorist camps in Pakistan. Is it believable that the Musharraf government is entirely unaware of them? Pakistan is playing a dirty game in pretending to root out terrorism while nurturing it. Musharrafs contention, that the terrorist camps across the border are freelance in nature, does not absolve him of the responsibility of dismantling them. Peace talks with Pakistan will not bear fruit unless it changes its stance on Kashmir. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Sir Both the heads of state of India and Pakistan keep arranging meetings without any real hope of a breakthrough. The issue can be resolved by the sincere efforts of hardliners in the two countries. People across the borders are eager to see an end to the problem. Hopefully, with the recent agreement on terror management, the menace will be contained. 

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir The fact that Manmohan Singh agreed to meet Pervez Musharraf in Havana and decided to continue the peace process, attests to Indias gullibility. Perhaps nothing more can be expected of a weak and indecisive government like Indias. The Bharatiya Janata Party has justifiably raised questions about the national interest being at stake. How could Singh say that Pakistan too is a victim of terrorism and that India and Pakistan need to fight terror jointly? Sensitive decisions such as resuming talks with a country suspected of importing terrorism into India should have been taken after consultation with all allies as well as the opposition. 

 Yours faithfully,

Manmath Deshpande, Nagpur

 Sir The wisdom of signing a pact with the alleged perpetrator of almost all terrorist activities in India is highly disputable (Finer points missing form terror plan, Sept 19). The details of the pact have not been made public but it is alleged that its main clause lays down that the intelligence gathered by IB and RAW will have to be shared with Pakistan (read the ISI). India might as well have made an agreement with Harkat-ul-Mujahideen or Lashker-e-Toiba. As the government led by the United Progressive Alliance takes the nation from the frying pan to the fire, it is the innocent who will continue to suffer.

 Yours faithfully,

S.B. Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir Indias new joint terror action plan with Pakistan clearly shows that our country has become a stooge of the United States of America. What else can explain the agreement in the face of repeated terror attacks on India? Excusing Pakistan for the terror unleashed in Kashmir and elsewhere in the country is certainly not going to solve Indias problems. With India recanting its decision to withhold talks till the Mumbai train blasts and the Malegaon bombings are thoroughly investigated, the Pakistan government regains its much-needed credibility to the detriment of our safety. Typically, the Congress-led UPA government has adopted appeasement as the basic ingredient of its foreign policy. This is as much visible in Indias current dealings with the US on nuclear matters, as in the resumption of dialogue with Pakistan.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Kamat, Alto Betim, Goa

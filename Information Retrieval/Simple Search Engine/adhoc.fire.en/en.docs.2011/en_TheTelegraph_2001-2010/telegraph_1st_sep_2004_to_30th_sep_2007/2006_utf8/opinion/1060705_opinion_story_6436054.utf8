The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 STILL BURNING

 She led by a light that was both kindly and heroic. There is thus a dark symbolism about the killing of Takhellambam Maneka Devi. She was a leader of a women?s group in Manipur that called itself meira paibis or ?women torch-bearers? and fought social evils like alcoholism, drug abuse and ?excesses? by the security forces. Her death at the hands of unknown assailants is only superficially yet another story of administrative failure or of senseless violence by militant groups. Tragic as it is, the death is essentially a heroic tale of courage in the face of deadly odds. It is no coincidence that yet another woman pays with her life for defying the evil forces. The bravery of Manipur?s women has achieved almost an iconic status. Maneka Devi?s death adds to the legacy of Thangjam Manorama, whose death in army custody triggered a massive protest two years ago. It also brings to mind the act of some women who sent shock waves far beyond Manipur by stripping in public to protest against ?army excesses?. 

 However, the torch that Maneka Devi held up was not merely one of protest. It signalled her ? and the group?s ? battle to cleanse their society of some evil practices. Like Nagaland and Assam next door, Manipur has bled long due to its ethnic insurgencies. In Manipur?s case, the ordeals have been worsened by the rise in some social vices. Together with the insurgency-related violence, Manipur has become a fertile ground for alcoholism, drug abuse and a high incidence of HIV/AIDS. Maneka Devi personified the Manipuri women?s fight against these evils. Her killing is thus more heinous than the deaths from the militants? ambush or from the army?s counter-offensives. The state has a duty to find and punish her killers. But the women of Manipur have shown what to do when the state fails. The best way to remember Maneka Devi is by keeping her fight ? and her hopes ? alive.

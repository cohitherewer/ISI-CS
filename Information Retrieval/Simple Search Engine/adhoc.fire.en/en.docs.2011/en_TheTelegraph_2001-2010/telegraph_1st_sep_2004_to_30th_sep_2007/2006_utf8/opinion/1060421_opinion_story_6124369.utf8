The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

Hardly any snob value 

 ELITE CLUBS OF INDIA (Bhageria Foundation, Rs 3,900) by Purshottam Bhageria 

and Pavan Malhotra is a murderously heavy tome that combines tacky design and 

embarrassingly bad writing ? all the more embarrassing because it tries to affect 

expensive, coffee-table classiness. ?As civilization onward reels,? the authors 

conclude, ?It?s Clubs that grease the speeding wheels.? This book is positively 

dripping with grease as it tries to put on a bluff British manner: ?And you have 

to be a good sport, old boy. Play the game and all that. The grand style continues... 

golf, tennis, rugby at places along with squash, billiards, swimming and of course 

the social life revolving around the card rooms. You are different... you are 

among the chosen few.? This is the entrance to the Bangalore Club, established 

1863: ?a quintessential British Club and has snob value?.

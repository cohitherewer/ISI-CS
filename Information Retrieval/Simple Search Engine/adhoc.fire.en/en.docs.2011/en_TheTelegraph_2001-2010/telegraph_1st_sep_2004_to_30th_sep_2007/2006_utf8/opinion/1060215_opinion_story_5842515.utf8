 Letters to Editor

 Keep faith

 Sir ? Swapan Dasgupta rightly points out in ?Dogmatic certitude? (Feb 10) that Muslims are feeding on an exaggerated sense of victimhood, coupled with the belief that their faith is superior to that of the ?kafirs? or non-believers. The religious war is wreaking havoc on the world. Young men and women, indoctrinated in a violent ideology that defies modernity, are volunteering as human bombs. The ghetto-mentality that rules the community can be changed only if there is proper education. The voices of moderate Islamists also need to grow stronger to curb the fundamentalists.

 Yours faithfully,

Pradip Chowdhury, Calcutta

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Over board? (Feb 8), has described the Muslim protest against the publication of cartoons of Prophet Mohammad as ?religious fanaticism?. Attacking adherents of other faiths, desecrating or vandalizing a place of worship or a holy book amount to religious fanaticism, and Muslims have not indulged in them. It would be na?ve to expect them to be calm when the founder of their faith is insulted. Had the religious heads of other faiths like Judaism, Christianity or Buddhism been similarly ridiculed, would protests by their believers have been any less severe? The right to freedom of expression is one of the pre-requisites of a democracy. But this right cannot be used as a licence to be disparaging of a religion. The Western media has been quite notorious for its hostility towards Islam, especially after the World Trade Center attack. India should stop judging Muslims from the Western perspective. 

 Yours faithfully,

Serajuddin Khurram, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Swapan Dasgupta warns in ?Dogmatic certitude? that ?a faultline is developing between Islam and universal modern values.? There is no doubt that the strictured approach of Islam is unsuited to a modern progressive society. Witness its prescription of ?execution? for blasphemy while the world is striving for a ban on capital punishment. No wonder Muslims have reacted so violently to the publication of the cartoons of Prophet Mohammad. Sunanda K. Datta-Ray explains in ?Taking God seriously? (Feb 11) that any pictorial representation of Islam?s prophet is sacrilegious. But representations of the prophet are not new. And in any case, they do not merit such worldwide response. This only exposes the insecurity and lack of humour among Muslims.

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Sunanda K. Datta-Ray?s ?Taking God seriously? does not really address the complexities of the issue of the Danish cartoons. The published cartoons were undoubtedly insensitive. But would illustrations of the prophet in children?s books be overlooked? Datta-Ray himself suggests that they would not have been. The problem is where does one draw the line? How much should one compromise to ?respect? the sentiments of a particular community? On the other hand, what is ?freedom of expression?? 

 The world seems to be divided into those who believe in Islam and those who do not. And those who do not must prioritize the wishes of those who do. Showing restraint and consideration should not be taken to signify that there is universal brotherhood at the core. It simply means that not showing respect would result in difficult situations such as the one we have now. 

 Yours faithfully,

Rabea Saleh, Calcutta 

 Sir ? It is surprising that the editorial, ?Over board?, defends the Danish daily?s right to publish the cartoons in the name of press freedom in a liberal society, while simultaneously acknowledging the blow dealt to the religious sentiments of the Muslim community. By depicting the prophet as a terrorist, the publishers of Jyllands-Posten have made Islam synonymous with terrorism. Islam is a tolerant religion that preaches peace, love and brotherhood, not only among Muslims but amongst non-Muslims as well. But what does one do if one?s religion is depicted as anti-social, all in the guise of exercising democracy? Individuals are free to hold their personal opinions but the media are expected to be more responsible. Though illustrations of any kind are banned in Islam, pictures of the prophet would not have raised such an outcry if he had been portrayed in a more dignified manner. The West?s preaching of the values of multiculturalism cannot be taken seriously if it does not take into consideration the religious sentiments of other communities.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? Islam might be a comparatively new religion, but with a billion followers worldwide, and its advocacy of tolerance, equality and humanity, it is in no way inferior to the older, established religions. Neocons in Washington and their allies in Europe have plotted the war against Islam ever since the Cold War ended. Every faith has a minority which trades in terror, but they do not speak for the majority. The demolition of the Babri Masjid and, more recently, the pogrom in Gujarat showed intolerance and hatred. Yet they did not demean the ancient faiths of India. One stray act of violence by a religious community should not be taken as proof of its inherent value system.

 Yours faithfully

Rinku Chowdhury, Burdwan

 Sir ? Blind faith and sentiment are associated with every religion and if someone deliberately hurts them, there are bound to be repercussions. The Danish prime minister?s refusal to apologize to Muslims for the caricature of Prophet Mohammad shows that a number of Western countries think of Muslims as violent and intolerant. When Muslims protest over any issue, the entire world cries foul. But when powerful nations like the United States of America carries out its policy of aggrandizement against Afghanistan and Iraq, it is justified as an act of crushing terrorism. Not only Muslims, but Hindus too have often vented their anger over a number of issues. Take the protest against the paintings of M.F. Husain, which hurt religious sentiments. Is this not an act of fanaticism, too? 

 Yours faithfully,

Md Ayub Ansari, Jagatdal ,West Bengal

 Extracts from the ILO?s regional high-level tripartite meeting on the Role of Labour Inspection in combating Child Labour, Harare, 2001 

 In 1802, Parliament in Great Britain passed an ?Act to preserve the morals of apprentices?. The definition of ?morals? included what today would be termed as the occupational safety, health and welfare of these ?apprentices?, who were in fact just child workers in different trades, most notoriously in mining, textiles, chimney sweeping, etc. ?Enforcement? of this first ever child labour-protection legislation worldwide was entrusted to committees of respected men from society, but since compliance was entirely voluntary, these ?monitors? proved ineffective.

 Thereupon, in 1833, the first four factory inspectors were appointed to His Majesty?s Government to control, inter alia, excessively long working hours of children and young persons. The birth of labour inspection is thus historically linked to the felt need to effectively control and combat the worst abuses of children in the world of work and to safeguard their health.

 This linkage of issues regarding labour inspection on the one hand, and child labour on the other, is further underlined by the fact that at the very first International Labour Conference of the ILO, in 1919... new international standards were adopted by the community of ILO members on both labour inspection and child labour protection: Convention No. 5, which prohibited work done by children of less than 14 years of age in industrial undertakings; and Recommendation No. 5, which urged member states to fulfil their obligation... to set up a national system of labour inspection. This close interrelationship found further expression in subsequent ILO standard setting work. Thus, both the fundamental ILO Conventions and Recommendations combating child labour...include provisions on enforcement by inspection systems; and likewise, both ILO Labour Inspection Conventions...covering industry, commerce, mining and transport, and... all manner of agricultural activities, refer to the principal duty of labour inspectors to secure...legal provisions relating to the employment of children and young persons.

 Child work and child labour: although ?child? can be defined in terms of age, some societies may see the fulfilment of certain social rites and traditional obligations as marking the transition from childhood to adulthood, whilst in others the integration of children into social and working life maybe so gradual that it is not possible to separate the phases. In the context of child labour, however, a child may be a person below the age limit of 15-years... or, in the wider context of the UN Convention of the Rights on the Child (1989), below 18-years.

 Some light work can be an essential part of a child?s socialization and development process and a means of transmitting acquired skills from parent to child. From the age of 6 or 7 many will be helping around the home...tending livestock, fetching water or collecting wood. Not all work is harmful to children; work experience can involve acquiring the right sort of skills and responsibilities for the child to become a useful member of the community. Children learn to take responsibility, and pride in their own activities. They might be involved in craft workshops ...assisting their parents in ancillary tasks, acquiring skills and gradually becoming full-fledged workers in family establishments or trades. Work of this kind is not without its problems, especially as regards the children?s health and safety and their schooling, but it is not what is generally meant by child labour.

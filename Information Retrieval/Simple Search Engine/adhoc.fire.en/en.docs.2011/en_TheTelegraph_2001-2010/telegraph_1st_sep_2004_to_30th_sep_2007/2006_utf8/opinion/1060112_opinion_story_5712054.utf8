 In at least some countries, female injecting drug users are more likely to be in a sexual relationship with another injecting drug user than are male injecting drug users. A woman in partnership with a male injecting drug user tends to default to sex work in order to support both her and her partners drug dependence.

 Thirty-five per cent had had unprotected commercial sex. A study in Sao Paulo, Brazil, found that 40 per cent of HIV infected females were infected through unsafe sexual activity with injecting drug users. A study of the wives of HIV positive male injecting drug users in Manipur, India, revealed that 45 per cent were HIV infected, although none reported ever injecting, and 97 per cent reported having sexual relations only with their husbands. Only 15 per cent reported using condoms at least half the time within the last year. An association was also established between the husband reporting a sexually transmitted infection and HIV prevalence in wives, suggesting either that sexually transmitted infections are a marker of unsafe sexual activity or that they facilitate the transmission of HIV.

 Studies have found that 8 per cent of sexual partners of HIV infected injecting drug users in the Russian Federation have been infected, compared to 6 per cent in Ukraine.... In Argentina, it is estimated that 12 per cent of all HIV infections in women result from unsafe sexual activity with a male injecting drug user.

 A consistent characteristic across studies is that injecting drug users are less likely to use condoms with primary sexual partners. In situations where the partner also injects, injecting drug users are also more likely to share injecting equipment with their primary partner. This is illustrated by a study of injecting drug users at needle syringe programmes in the north-eastern United States, where 54 per cent said they never used a condom with their primary sexual partner compared with 33 per cent, who never used one with non-primary partners. Twice as many injecting drug users reported that they shared injecting equipment with their primary sexual partner as compared with a non-primary partner.

 Men and women who have same sex partners: having sex with another man creates additional risk of HIV transmission for male injecting drug users. A survey of this population in Denver in the US demonstrated high-risk sexual behaviours with multiple partners of both genders. Over 80 per cent had more than one male partner, 20 per cent had non-primary female partners, and 15 per cent exchanged sex for money or drugs. Condom use was inconsistent and infrequent for all types of sex (vaginal, anal and oral) and with all types of partners; 90 per cent injected cocaine and 59 per cent used methamphetamine ? drugs associated with risky injecting and sexual practices; 45 per cent of this sample was HIV infected. Significantly, in this study, men who had sex with men and who injected did not identify strongly with either men who have sex with men or injecting drug users. Other studies have shown that men who have sex with men and inject identify most strongly with their drug use rather than their sexual practice.

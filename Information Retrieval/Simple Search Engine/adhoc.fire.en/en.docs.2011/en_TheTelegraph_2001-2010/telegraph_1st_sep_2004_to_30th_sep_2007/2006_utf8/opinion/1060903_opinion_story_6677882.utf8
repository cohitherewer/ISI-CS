Letters to Editor

Blame it on the woman 

Sir What Michael Noer has said in Dont marry career 

women is merely what generations of men have felt towards married working women 

(Outrage over advice against career women, Aug 28). A man develops an inferiority 

complex when his wife does well professionally. He gradually ceases to cooperate 

with his wife. This results in inevitable problems, often involving the in-laws. 

Our society expects a woman to quit her career if domestic problems arise, as 

if it is her responsibility alone to maintain peace in the family. 

Yours faithfully, 

Moumita Nandi, Calcutta

Of little help 

Sir It is assuring to hear the prime minister announce 

that there is no need to equate terrorism and terrorists with any one community 

(Minority wail reaches PM, Aug 22). Yet, one wonders whether the law-enforcers 

will change their attitude towards the minority communities, now that Manmohan 

Singh has finally understood their suffering. Moreover, one doubts whether the 

prime ministers announcement will stop the general public from looking upon every 

bearded person wearing a skullcap with suspicion. There is no guarantee that what 

happened to the passengers on Flight NW42 at Amsterdam will not be repeated again. 

I wonder who is to take the blame for this. Should it be the politicians, terrorists, 

minorities or our own selves? 

Yours faithfully, 

Ranadhish Choudhuri, Calcutta

Sir It has become a matter of grave concern that 

Muslims feel alienated from society because of the manner in which the inspections 

were carried out after the Mumbai blasts. To maintain the nations secular status 

and to preserve the equality of all citizens, mutual trust and confidence-building 

measures need to be implemented immediately. What is most disturbing is that every 

terror strike in India is blamed on the Muslim population of the country. It is 

true that all Muslims are not terrorists. But we also have to accept the fact 

that some of the worlds most dreaded terrorists are Muslims. Islam teaches peace, 

amity and tolerance but, unfortunately, some of its followers have been guilty 

of violating these principles. After the Mumbai blasts, there have been reports 

of police excess on Muslim youths. Perhaps, it would be better if Muslim leaders 

discussed this issue with Singh to try and weed out the troublemakers from their 

community. At the same time, Singh should not prescribe a policy of appeasement 

and compromise the nations security. 

Yours faithfully, 

S. Mukherjee, Burdwan 

Sir The prime minister, Manmohan Singh, has assured 

the minority community that he would discuss the issue of discrimination against 

Muslims with the chief ministers of various states. This is a welcome move, considering 

the fact that many heroes of Indias independence movement hailed from the minority 

community and contributed immensely to the cause. So, it would be wrong to assume 

that Indian Muslims are less patriotic than members of other faiths. However, 

one suspects that Muslims lag behind in demonstrating their love for the country. 

If they really wanted to let the countrymen know that they get hurt by such insinuations, 

they should all come out on to the streets and raise anti-terrorist slogans. They 

should also remind themselves to don their skull caps and beards while taking 

part in such demonstrations. If Indian Muslims come together to denounce the spectre 

of terrorism that is haunting the country, they will be successful in effacing 

the grudges borne by non Muslims. This would also put an end to their sense of 

alienation. 

Yours faithfully, 

Sudeep Ghosh Moulick, Siliguri

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 After making a mountain out of a mole(hill), the media have quickly shifted attention to slippery truth behind the Natwar-Jagat saga. But that has neither stopped tongues wagging, nor made life any easier for Jaswant Singh. There is keen speculation on what could have prompted his misadventure. Some say it is the Pakistan connection. According to this theory, a visit to Pakistan does something to you. It happened to LK Advani, who was found shooting his mouth on MA Jinnah in Pakistan itself. Jaswant, too, was there remember the famous Hinglaj visit? but somehow managed to keep his composure. The stress must have proved too much though. Another theory puts the blame on a marketing strategy which misfired. In his prior meetings with publishers, Jaswant, apparently never hinted at anything resembling a CIA mole, although there were extended parleys on the hijacking episode and Strobe Talbott. The brilliant idea of the spy-that-wasnt must have cropped up later to push the book sales. But no matter which theory you subscribe to, one thing is certain. A furious Jhandewalan may force Jaswant to quit from the post of the partys leader of the opposition in the upper house and, even if that fails, to enforce a ban on sanghis travelling to Pakistan. 

 While the good doctors popularity graph is plunging, that of the UPA chairman, Sonia Gandhi, seems to be perpetually on the rise. She is now often seen in the central hall of parliament, engaged in pleasant chit-chat with all and sundry. Days ago, she even decided to order some dosas while the conversation flowed. The eatables, however, took more time to arrive than usual, and everyone immediately hollered accusations at Lalu and his taskforce (the canteen is managed by the railways). Sonia stayed on, even after the dosas had been consumed, although not entirely because she wished to. An MP had dropped a glass of water on her, but Sonia, politeness personified, wasnt complaining.

 Your enemys enemy is your friend. Is that why Mamata Banerjee is, supposedly, planning bigger things for Jagmohan Dalmiya? The buzz is that didi, who recently praised Sonia to the hilt on the office of profit issue, has decided to get Dalmiya elected to the Rajya Sabha with Congress support. With partyman Dinesh Trivedi, retiring this year, that is eminently possible. Will Buddha be able to put up with so much evil?

 The tradition of the babalog taking over the political mantle is not restricted to the Nehru-Gandhis. The daughter of the NCP president, agriculture minister and BCCI chief, Supriya Pawar, is all set to enter the Rajya Sabha. She will take the place of NCP member, Vasant Chavan, who died recently. Her entry in politics has been speculated on ever since Pawars health started failing. There remains a question though. Will the NCP ally support her, especially given the way Pawar ditched the Congress candidate and helped Rahul Bajaj to win? 

 The Haryana CM, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, has another interest besides helping children in distress. He seems to collect club memberships as personal trophies, and it doesnt matter if he has no time for either social or recreational activities. Hooda was recently nominated member of the prestigious Delhi Golf Club. The CM also became a member of the India International Centre recently, although he has been a member of another of the capitals upmarket watering hole, Habitat Centre. Hooda is also member of the Air Force Golf Club. 

 The junior minister for industry and commerce, Ashwani Kumar, is very particular. He never uses his official car when not on official duty. But his strict principles did not restrain him from fixing a red light on top of his personal car. Kumar should perhaps be excused. One needs some assurance of ones ministerial status, especially if senior ministers dont send down any important files for signature.

 There can be no doubts about the frost between Shah Rukh Khan and the Big B. The Bollywood grapevine is even suggesting that Bachchans proximity to the Samajwadi Party is taking King Khan closer to the Congress. Is it so madam?

 Footnote

 Talk of ishtyle, and one immediately starts thinking of the businessmen who have made politics their business. There is the king of good times, Vijay Mallya, who does not waste time talking politics. Another is RP Goenka, who spends a lot of time in the Rajya Sabha, but keeps his own counsel outside the house. Videocons Dhoot is rarely seen in the central hall. One among this breed who cuts a refreshingly different picture is Rahul Bajaj. He not only listens to debates in rapt attention but is also equally eager to carry on the verbal battles outside the central hall. The other day, however, he was caught off guard for a little while when he was teased about his silk kurta. Why not switch to khadi? one asked. Without reminding the questioner about his familys long connection with Gandhi, Bajaj merely informed that he had given up wearing it for years. As for a brand favoured by most parliamentarians, Bajaj, trying not to sound snooty, merely said that he lived in Pune, not Delhi. Smooth talker!

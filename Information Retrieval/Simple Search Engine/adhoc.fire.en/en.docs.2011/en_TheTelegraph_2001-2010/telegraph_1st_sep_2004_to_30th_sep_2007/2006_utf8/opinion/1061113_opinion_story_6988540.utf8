 CHARACTER AND WISDOM IN TWENTY-TWO YARDS

 With the demise of Polly Umrigar, Raju Mukherji has lost the man he most respected in Indian cricket

 No schoolboy fiction was ever conceived without the wide shoulders, the clear-cut features and the booming voice which went on to make the heros personality. We had come to believe that such qualities were found only in story books. But in Polly Umrigars story, it was no fiction. It was as authentic as the city of Mumbai, which had nurtured and nourished him.

 Christened Pahlan Rattanji Umrigar, he was a larger than life persona. The massive frame sheltered a heart still bigger. Never did those shoulders stoop. Rather, they were always strong enough to carry his peers. His magnanimous presence captivated all and sundry.

 As a child, I had often seen him saving India from embarrassment. But the first distinct impression that remains is that of a leader harnessing his men to victory. The year was 1961-62; the venue Eden Gardens, and the opposition Ted Dexters England (then MCC). Polly Umrigar was not the appointed captain. But in the absence of the skipper, Nari Contractor, he introduced Ramakant Desai from the High Court end and brought about the downfall of the prolific Ken Barrington. Desai bounced, Barrington hooked and Durrani, at square leg, made the difficult catch look easy. That masterpiece of tactics opened the floodgates and England collapsed, giving India its first-ever test match victory at Eden Gardens. As the dignified figure of Umrigar receded into the pavilion, he walked into crickets hall of fame. Never before or after had a deputy captain made such an inspiring move to liven up an almost dead test match.

 I met him later in 1976, when he was a national selector. During the course of the Eden test match, he and his colleagues wanted to have a look at the test prospects from East Zone. A hasty net session was organized. All the national selectors, except the East Zone representative, turned up, as did the potential players. But no one had bothered to prepare the pitch for the net session! Kishen Rungta was furious at the callousness of the local cricket administration. Umrigar was shocked and sympathized, Hope you boys are more fortunate next time. Later, as the secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, he took every possible step for the promotion of youth cricket so that no talent would be lost through carelessness.

 After my cricketing days were over, I kept in touch with Polly kaka. I would write to him very often with proposals and suggestions. Not once did he seem annoyed. On the contrary, he would write back words of encouragement and discuss cricket issues in detail. Those letters are the treasures of my private collection of cricket memorabilia.

 Sir Garfield Sobers was undoubtedly the greatest of all-rounders. He was a rare three-in-one all-rounder; a person capable of bowling pace and spin, besides batting. But was he the first of the three-in-ones? Surely not. That credit, arguably, may be conferred on Polly Umrigar, the most underrated of our sporting heroes. About his batting and off-spinning abilities legends abound, but his medium-paced out-swingers and off-cutters did not receive the recognition they deserved. At a time when India did not possess top-class pace bowlers, we had to rely on the incisive medium-pace of this burly all-rounder from Mumbai. Hardly ever did he disappoint. On the matting wicket of Bahawalpur in 1954-55 against Pakitan, he enjoyed his best spell with the new ball: 58-25-74-6.

 No Indian cricket-addict has quite been able to forget the way Umrigar was treated by the national selectors and the media. He was a natural leader of men, a man of dominating presence and astute thinking, and considerate too. He was not the kind to create a halo around himself to unnerve the newcomer. Nor would he have a permanent nod for the powers-that-be. He suffered the consequences of not belonging to any group. But this uncompromising posture made him our hero.

 Against Harry Caves New Zealand in 1955-56, Umrigars India won the series 2-0. Next winter, he went about consolidating the team whose nucleus was rapidly ageing. But constant changing and chopping did not help the teams morale against Ian Johnsons Australia. The series was lost. But Umrigars personality did not stoop even against the marauding West Indies, with the blistering pace of Wesley Hall and Roy Gilchrist and the genius of Rohan Kanhai and Garfield Sobers. India wrested an honorable draw in the first test but the strength of the opposition created an inferiority complex among the players.

 Umrigar spotted the problem soon enough and requested the selectors for a few changes. He wanted courageous men who would fight till the end. But the selectors refused to yield and Polly Umrigar, a man of high principles, relinquished the captaincy. No Indian captain before or since has shown such strength of character.

 However, to his credit, he never bore anybody any grudge, nor did he brood. He served under Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi, 15 years his junior, and wholeheartedly supported the young captain in West Indies in 1962. He played under several mediocre captains, but not once did he show any rancour or ill-will.

 A grave injustice was done to him by a flippant remark which went on to become an international headline. He had a dismal series in England in 1952. To make matters worse, it was said that he had backed away from the express deliveries of Freddie Trueman. If that was true, then it applied to many eminent names in international cricket. Did not the Australians fall in a heap against Peter Pollock in South Africa in 1970? Did not the Englishmen draw away from Lillee and Thompson in Australia? There are numerous similar examples. Why was Umrigar singled out?

 But the fact remains that he went back to England in 1959 and collared Trueman and Harold Rhodes and smashed an innings of 118 at Old Trafford. He took on the mighty Wes Hall in his own backyard, and made an unbeaten 172. Where were those who had derided Umrigar on his first tour in 1952? 

 Against Fazal Mahmoods men, he had his most successful series ever. He reeled off three centuries in five tests. When he retired in 1962, he had a fantastic average of 42.22, with 3,631 runs, including 12 centuries.

 As a bowler he never got his due. Overshadowed by Vinoo Mankad, Ghulam Ahmed and Subhash Gupte, he was always considered to be second fiddle. Yet when the Aussies capsized against Jasu Patel in Kanpur in 1959, it was Umrigars four vital wickets, including those of Neil Harvey and Norman ONeil, that hastened the disaster. As a fieldsman, he was in the top bracket, whether close in or deep. A safe pair of hands, a strong throw and impeccable anticipation were his hallmarks.

 After retirement from cricket, he was still more active in the service of the game. As coach, manager, administrator, he left his mark. Remarkably open to views of all kinds, he would take suggestions even from laymen. He studied diligently and then made his recommendations to BCCI. It was primarily because of his initiative that former players, both test and first-class, now receive pension from the BCCI in recognition of their services to Indian cricket.

 I met him once at Sunil Banerjees place in Calcutta. Poly Kaka had read a piece I had written about him and thanked me profusely: Raju, that article of yours pleasantly surprised my family. They thought no one remembered me any more. Next time you come to Mumbai, you must have a cup of tea with us. With his demise, I have lost the man whom I respected the most in Indian cricket.

 Polly Umrigars retirement from active cricket had a unique ring about it. After scores of 56, 172 not out, 32 and 60 against Hall, Sobers and Gibbs, he decided that he had had enough. People were aghast. They kept asking why. Umrigars classic reply was, Better now when they are asking why than later when they would be asking why not. What a lesson from a champion sportsman! He taught us what character was; what wisdom meant.

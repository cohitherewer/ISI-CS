 VIEW FROM THE UNDERGROUND

 For intelligence to be tightened at the lowest level, the police have to rebuild its network of informants, writes Sumanta Sen

 Preventive action

 In the midst of all the groping around about who could have masterminded the July 11 blasts in Mumbai, came the written observation of the citys police chief that the explosions were the handiwork of terrorists who were no ordinary thugs but highly trained experts. It did not require the experience of such a highly placed policeman to come to this conclusion. Indeed, behind the observation lay an admission of helplessness. The police today are clearly up against opponents whom they cannot match, not just in the nations business capital but in other cities also.

 The same feeling of helplessness could be discerned in the words of the former army chief, General Shankar Roy Chowdhury. In an interview to a private television channel recently, the veteran soldier kept on insisting that the intelligence network must be tightened at the lowest, that is the thana-level, and this would not be possible without the cooperation of the public. Since that cannot be done in a day, the country will continue to lie exposed to attacks and deaths. The Mumbai police chief had not mentioned intelligence failure in so many words, but it is amply clear that he was also referring to the same thing.

 Non-professionals are also saying the same and quite a few politicians are gunning for the Union home minister, Shivraj Patil. Being in charge of internal security, the man certainly has to answer a lot of questions, particularly as he has not exactly impressed the world with his performance in the last two years. Still, have heart. The man from Maharashtra has to work with a force that is overburdened with the wrongs of the past.

 It all began in the Sixties of the last century when the Congress government at the Centre decided to go in for preventive detention in a large way. Defence of India Rules, Maintenance of Internal Security Act and such other measures became convenient tools in the hands of an administration which was as keen to lock up political opponents without normal trial as to pick up anti-social elements not to the liking of the then political dispensation. The police were happy, they were spared the hassle of framing charges and proving people guilty in courts.

 This not only led to a curb on civil liberties, with time it began to tell on the efficiency of the force. Calcutta police, for instance, used to be hailed at one time for its performance, which was believed to be comparable to that of Scotland Yard as it was then. The detective department could be counted upon to nab potential wrongdoers, and with plenty of evidence to be placed before a court of law. Slowly, this efficiency began to wear out as preventive detention dispensed, to a large extent, with the need for investigation. Indeed, when the Left Front came to office in 1977 and did away with preventive detention, a senior police officer had confided to this contributor, What do we do now, our sources at the thana level have mostly dried up. 

 Even though nearly 30 years have passed since then, things do not seem to have changed much. Very often we come across reports of arrested people getting bail because of lack of evidence. The police bosses are very often at a loss as to what to do with their men at the lower levels. Actually, they cannot really be blamed because the legacy they inherited continues to remain a stumbling block. They are constantly urged to tone up their public relations in the interests of their image as a whole. The greater need of returning to the old days, when an army of effective sources existed to help the cops, seems to have been ignored. In his interview, Roy Chowdhury was perhaps actually referring to this when he spoke of public cooperation.

 And this holds good for other cities also. As for Mumbai, one witnessed a different and strange spectacle. Again on the small screen one saw shoeshine boys being shown as sources of information for the city police. Nothing wrong with that, save the question that if the police themselves had told the journalists about these boys, hadnt they then committed the cardinal scene of exposing their hidden armoury? Any denial by the police on this account can be taken with a pinch of salt.

 At this stage one may ask, why is the thana-level performance being given such importance when the issue is that of countering terrorism on a large scale, involving organizations with worldwide networks. Such importance is being given because these organizations need operators at the base level to do the job and that is where the thana comes in. For instance, who had actually triggered off the Mumbai blasts may not be known as yet, but it cannot be denied that local-level criminals had a big hand to play in the planning of the operation by way of providing vital information. The law-enforcers may lack sources, but it is clearly not so with the law-breakers. Yet it could well have been the other way round had the instrument of preventive detention not been used to such a large degree and over so many years. Even now, the police do act on tip-offs and act successfully, but whenever it comes to the big thing, like the blasts at Akshardham temple or the ones in Mumbai or the attack on parliament house, it is seen that they had no clue as to what was being planned. The power to keep eyes and ears open has surely shrunk and there is little point in searching for the reason. It lies within. If the ordinary stationhouse cannot perform as it did in the past then there can be no hope for the ordinary citizen. This is not theorizing, this is the opinion of many experienced officers, now retired.

 How bad things have become can be assessed from what happened at Salt Lake a few years ago. A retired police officer, one who had belonged to the top echelons, had rented out the ground floor of his house to people who later turned out to be terrorists. When this was discovered, the man argued that he was so preoccupied with his sons illness that he could not pay sufficient attention to who the tenants were or to inform the local thana about them. Thus he had violated a direction given to all by the police and should have been hauled over the coals. But then crow does not eat crow flesh. So much for awareness at the top. And he was with a central agency at that.

 So what is the immediate way out? Bring back the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, says the Bharatiya Janata Party, only to be rightly snubbed by the prime minister, who pointed out that the law has not served any purpose. Protagonists of such laws should realize even at this stage that preventive detention has eaten deeply into the system and will continue to do so the more it is used. Talking of Mumbai, in the last 13 years, there have been a number of blasts but how many have actually been convicted by a court of law?

 Another question that was asked immediately after the July 11 incident was why Mumbai all the time? The answer should be simple. When a terrorist organization looks for local operators it searches the underground, and which other city has such a vast underground as Mumbai has? It is no secret that the underground has made inroads into various layers of society, which can only be to the liking of the mass killers. Crime and money do go hand in hand and Calcutta should thank itself for being a poorer city. Mumbaikars may well have the misfortune of seeing their much-acclaimed resilience being tested again.

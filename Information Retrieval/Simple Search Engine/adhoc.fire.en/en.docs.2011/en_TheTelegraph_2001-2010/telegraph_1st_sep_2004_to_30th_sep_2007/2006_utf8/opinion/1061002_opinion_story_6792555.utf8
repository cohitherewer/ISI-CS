 Wild woes

 Sir It is pathetic that 21 lions are standing on the brink of death as a result of a failed and erroneous cross-breeding experiment carried out by the officials of the Chhatbir zoo in Chandigarh (Hybrid lions wait for death, Sept 18). Callous experiments on animals should be banned immediately, especially when the motive behind this particular project had been merely to boost the parks attraction for tourists. It is ironic that the breeding programme, which helped restore the decreasing population of Asiatic lions back in the Eighties, has resulted in serious problems after almost two decades. The government and the authorities should remember that the number of lions all over the world has dwindled threateningly over the years. It is time to preserve the few that are left rather than jeopardizing their life with cruel experiments. 

 Yours faithfully,

Rahul Roy, Calcutta

 Sir Thank god for the radio astronomer who ventured into the domain of bird-watchers (After six decades, a new bird, Sept 13). The discovery of a new species of birds capable of singing distinct fluty songs, named Bugun Liocichla after the tribe, is an honour for Arunachal Pradeshs Eaglenest sanctuary. But the census figure of 14 is a call for conservationists to take steps to preserve and protect this new species. It should not meet the same fate as certain endangered black bucks of Rajasthan, which fell victim to high-profile shikaris. 

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta 

 A religious Marxist

 Sir If a kara-wearing turbaned Sikh could be the general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), why is there such a hullabaloo about Subhas Chakraborty visiting some Kali temple and offering flowers? Arent surnames like Basu, Bhattacharya and Chakraborty un-Communist too, since they indicate caste? Has it stopped our Marxist hardliners from using surnames?

 Yours faithfully,

Subroto Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir The controversy involving Subhas Chakraborty reminded me of an incident that happened in 1974 in Warsaw. I had asked the director of the Ship Research Institute at Gdansk, Poland, What do you communists mean when you say that you do not believe in god or religion? After pausing for a minute he said, Have you seen a radish? How does it look like from outside? I said, It looks red. How does it look like when you halve it? he asked. It looks white inside, I replied. That is the depth of red in communism, he declared. I realized how correct he was after the fall of the Soviet Union. All the religious places which were suppressed for so many years were back in business immediately.

 Yours faithfully,

T.N. Saha, Calcutta

 Sir Hats off to Subhas Chakraborty for worshipping Kali as a true devotee, without fearing the consequences. All the communist ministers of the state owe their position to the votes of lakhs of believers. A true communist ought not to take favours from a believer. If one is dependent on believers, how can he flaunt his atheism or secularism? 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Datta, Calcutta 

 Sir Subhas Chakrabortys visit to Tarapeeth was a calculated move aimed at wooing the BJP/NDA vote bank. Remember that Tapan Sikdar, the former state BJP president, is an important player in Chakrabortys constituency. The Bengal sports and youth affairs minister has been in politics for too long to do something like worshipping Kali without an ulterior political motive. 

 Yours faithfully,

Santanu Datta, Calcutta 

 Sir It is a bit too much to believe that Subhash Chakrabortys visit to Tarapeeth or his description of Jyoti Basu as the Krishna of modern times have resulted in the Communist Party of India (Marxist) facing an identity crisis (Subhass God deserts him, Sept 20) There was no need for the CPI(M) state secretary Biman Bose to forbid state secretariat members from attending religious functions. Marxist ideology is based on anti-capitalist principles. Bengals Marxists are distinctly pro-capitalist. If the communist government permits huge pandals in public parks and roads, what does it speak of the partys stand on religion? All said and done, it is not a good idea to encroach upon the faiths and beliefs of individuals. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Sir It is a pity that a Hindu minister in the Left Front government of Bengal was made to eat humble pie and apologize to the supposedly secular CPI(M) leadership for his conduct of praying in a temple and declaring that he is first a Hindu. Just when I was appreciating his assertiveness, he fell flat on his face and was pathetically biting the dust. The same left government which chides a minister for praying at a temple happens to spend no less than Rs 130 crore annually on madrassahs in the state. 

 It has also been revealed that 12 per cent of the students in the madarssahs are non-Muslims: the dearth of government schools in the state is why poor hindu students are forced to go to madrassahs. Has anyone heard the CPI(M) issuing diktats to the minority communities? But this is no surprise, for the communists have always had a warped idea of secularism. 

 Yours faithfully,

G. Vijayalakshmi, Chennai

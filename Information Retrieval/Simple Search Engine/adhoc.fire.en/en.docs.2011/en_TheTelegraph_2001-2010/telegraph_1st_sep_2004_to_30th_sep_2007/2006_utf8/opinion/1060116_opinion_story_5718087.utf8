 INTERSECTIONS AND PARALLELS

 SHOT IN THE DARK

 How 15 Park Avenue weaves a network of simultaneous realities

 Living, perhaps, is all about pliant, parallel realities. About physical existences that rear their heads from within the deepest layers of a rational mind. That?s what Aparna Sen reminds us of in her latest directorial venture, 15 Park Avenue. If in the film, the divorced elder sister volunteers to take up the responsibility of her younger, schizophrenic half-sister, hundreds of such little-known Indian families exist. Except for the fact that the problem happens to be a constant variable. Sometimes it is the unmarried sister or the paralytic father; on occasions it is the incorrigible alcoholic brother or an autistic child. 

 What is surprising is that despite the shackles of everyday living, the characters in each of these unknown families, as much in the film, keep playing an elusive game of parallel realities. They perform their social roles with as much perfection as dusting the mantle-piece at home on a Sunday morning. And the wondrous part of it is that each of these realities is essentially independent. None of them manages to trample over the other and emerge as the absolute reality. And that is the miracle of abstraction where the two parallel realities merge, and also split ? as and when necessary. 

 Ethics or morality has no universal standards. For one who goes by it, every single decision perhaps evolves out of a warped reality. Someone who can afford to bypass the subtle line manages to lead a hassle-free life. If the elder brother in the film is a suave smooth-talker, it is because he believes that is the right way to handle things. If the elder sister treads between occasional hysteria and situational absurdities, it is not because she chooses to, but because her reality demands that she respond to the requirements of the circumstances. And she responds ? and does not submit to the demands of her locale. This is how Sen makes her most important statement in the film ? the difference between responding and submitting to an irreversible daily-life-situation. 

 In the film, even a convenient lover ? who breaks off his engagement after the gangrape of his girlfriend and subsequent manifestation of her latent schizophrenia ? is not let off. He comes back, after 11 years, and is caught in a world of unexpected reality. Despite his dilemma, he cannot help but respond to the more pressing of his parallel realities. 

Throughout the film, Sen keeps challenging the elder 

sister?s decision through external interventions. Sometimes it is a lucrative 

offer to go abroad, sometimes love and sometimes the choking truths of her immediate 

realities. Yet, not for once does the character collapse. though there are times 

when she fails to live up to her own expectations. 

 This is where the strength of Sen?s film lies. She plays the final card when the schizophrenic sister?s reality ? so long the only stark, unreal world ? becomes her own reality and she starts looking for the same illusory elements in the context of her own reality. Warped realities, black and white realities, slippery realities and tangible realities ? all become one and the same. And in the course of watching the film, the indirect experience no longer remains a distant truth. It becomes a tangible reality stirring its head from within a network of dissociated worlds that all of us can finally identify with. Perhaps realities are finally as much about intersections as about parallels.

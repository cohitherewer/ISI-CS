 EXIT KING

 A king who wouldn?t retire is the stuff of Shakespearean tragedy. But an actual king who proposes his own retirement is poised, quite uniquely, between monarchy and modernity. Bhutan?s King Jigme Singye Wangchuk has been planning a retirement age of sixty-five for Bhutanese kings. This, among other far-ranging democratic reforms, is part of the draft constitution unveiled by the king in March last year. The Wangchuk hereditary monarch has ruled the ?Land of the Thunder Dragon? since 1907. King Jigme came to the throne in 1972 when he was only 17 and plans to retire in 2008, aged 52, once the constitution comes into force that year. The idea of the king?s retirement comes in conjunction with that of a national council to govern the country, filled by members elected to the national assembly. Although culturally a traditionalist, King Jigme?s reign saw the advent of radio broadcasting in 1973, television in 1999, and the first internet service the same year. This is the king who had said that ?the country is more important than the king?, and more famously, that Bhutan?s ?gross national happiness? is more important than its gross national product.

 Yet, there is a curious doubleness in the idea of the retiring king. One the one hand, it subjects the monarch to the impersonality of constitutional stipulations, paving the way for the accommodation of kingship within a modern democratic state. On the other hand, such a rule also seems to take the king more seriously than reducing him to a symbolic figure, shorn of political agency, as in other modern democracies. The 1998 reforms grant the Bhutanese National Assembly authority to remove the monarch with a two-thirds vote. But a king who is made to retire is also very much a functioning king, politically relevant within the government, unlike the largely decorative functions of the monarch in, say, Britain. But the Bhutanese king?s attempts at combining the dignity and aura of traditional monarchy with the imperatives of modern governance is unprecedented and hence, significant. The spirit of it is something that the Nepalese monarch, for instance, would do well to emulate, as would the many superannuated veterans, thriving on archaic notions of seniority, in governments that take pride in being democratic.

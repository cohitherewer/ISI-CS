 SCRIPSI

 Come not, 

 when I am dead,/ To drop thy foolish tears upon my grave,/ 

 To trample round my fallen head,/ And vex the unhappy 

 dust thou wouldst not save./ There let the wind sweep 

 and the plover cry;/ But thou, go by./ Child, if it were

 me where I lie:/ Go by, go by. ? ALFRED TENNYSON

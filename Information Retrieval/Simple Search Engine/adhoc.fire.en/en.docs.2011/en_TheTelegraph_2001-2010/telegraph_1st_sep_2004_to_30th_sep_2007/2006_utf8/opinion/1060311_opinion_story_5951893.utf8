The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 UNACCOMMODATED

 It is a question of what the eye has got used to. Every day, millions of more-or-less-comfortably-off Indians encounter thousands of homeless, abandoned human beings, many of them old and sick, in every kind of public space. The latter make up a sea of humanity ? men, women and children, abjectly poor in Calcutta, somewhat better organized in Mumbai. They are rendered invisible by what might be described as the naturalness of their presence, like the dogs and crows they share their resources with, and graced occasionally by the attentions of charity, social work, journalism or photography. So why did Ms Mira Moitra ? camping alone, at 73, on platform 1 of Birati station ? get noticed? And why does she have that look of crazed bafflement on her face, which might remind some of another ?unaccommodated? old person out of a Shakespearean tragedy?

 Ms Moitra, unmarried, has been denied shelter by a series of brothers and sisters-in-law, and has lost her sister?s address. Crippled and starving, she was spotted wandering around in Birati and brought to the station, which, she realizes now, is to be her ?home?. The Government Railway Police, assured of her harmlessness, have decided not to meddle. A local doctor has declared her days numbered. Yet, she is not dead, and with her clean, white sari, her walker and her articulate outrage turning into a wish to die, she is still recognizably an old ?lady?, though abandoned by her family. And it is the habits and markers of her class that doubly isolate her from the communities of the homeless who would surely be sharing the station premises with her. 

 Middle India is, therefore, duly shocked ? although it is an occurrence that is increasingly taking place in middle-class Indian homes, as the Calcutta high court has brought to the notice of the police recently. But even cruelty has a context. Elderly people like Ms Moitra have not only been abandoned by their families, but they have also been failed by inadequate laws and dysfunctional or non-existent justice, welfare and healthcare systems. The absence of a welfare system creates their inordinate dependence on the family, and the services that enable a secure and healthy life at a relatively low cost seem to exist solely to harass and exploit the elderly rather than provide them care and support. To blame it on the demise of the joint family is to misrepresent the complex, systemic and political nature of the problem ? an evasive moralism behind which governments often hide.

 Cases like Ms Moitra?s suddenly render the invisible visible again, for a while. The convenient otherness of poverty and abandonment on the streets comes closer home, and human presences, which had become elements of a familiar landscape, begin to acquire particular histories. Every streetchild or beggar has a story to tell as to how he got to where he finds himself today. And these stories usually implicate more than just a few cruel family members.

 POLL BOUNTY

 Trust the leftists of Bengal to make even newborn children matter in vote-bank politics. Poll-eve largesse, promises and posturings are nothing new to India?s politicians. But the Marxists seem to be way ahead of others in honing these electoral skills. So, over the next two months, activists of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) will visit households across the state, distributing ration cards for newborn and other children. Large numbers of these children would be from families living below the poverty line. The government and the party promise to issue BPL cards to nearly 1.53 crore people who are eligible to get them. And this in just two months! Other promises ? thousands of jobs in the government and in schools, provident fund schemes for some 6.5 lakh unorganized labourers and much more ? are cascading down from Alimuddin Street. 

 The cynicism of the exercise is as sickening as it is revolting. Nearly three decades in power have so stunted the sensitivity of the party bosses that they think nothing of insulting the people?s intelligence so brazenly. But the promises could well be turned into accusations against the leftists. They have to answer why all this work, especially those meant for the poor, was not done by a government that claims to be the sole protector of the people?s interests. Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee may well be asked if he is not trying to steal the people?s vote with false promises. If the sorry state of the government?s finances had earlier led it to freeze jobs, what has changed now to unlock the gate of promises? Yet, the leftists remain great pretenders to imagined virtues, which prompt them to pose a holier-than-thou attitude vis-?-vis governments run by other parties. 

 If it is the season of poll promises, it is also the time for old posturings. It is no coincidence that the announcement of the poll largesse in Bengal came on the same day that the party?s general secretary, Mr Prakash Karat, struck a shriller note in New Delhi in opposing the Centre?s liberalization moves. The left?s renewed attack on the United Progressive Alliance government?s plan for divestment in public sector units is clearly aimed at the coming assembly polls in the two left strongholds, West Bengal and Kerala. There is little doubt that the compulsions of electoral politics have inspired the left in extending its opposition to divestment in PSUs, from the navratna companies to even small ones. The same political motive is behind the opposition to the modernization of the airports in Mumbai and Delhi as well as to the privatization of pension funds. Yet, West Bengal?s chief minister has publicly spoken in favour of both pension fund reforms and privatization of new airports. The CPI(M) has made a fine art of doublespeak; but its poll politics is holding the economy to ransom.

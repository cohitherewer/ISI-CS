The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 SOUND AT 16, DEAF AT 36

 - More and more youngsters are complaining of a constant buzzing or ringing sound in their ears

 A modern lifestyle loaded with heavy sound bytes is all set to give birth to a deaf generation, warns Tirna Ray

 A group of youngsters walks around the snazzy multiplex in Calcuttas Salt Lake on a wintry afternoon, foreheads creased and lips sealed. They dont smile. They merely walk, much like Asimo humanoid robots. And just when you are convinced that these children are a bunch of weirdos, you bump into another lot of young boys and girls ? again, all unusually quiet. The mute teenagers take you by surprise ? till you spot the tiny headphones or a Walkman sitting pretty in the pouches of their belts. 

 Far from treading the silent zone, youngsters today are leading an incredibly noisy life. And as they happily turn a deaf ear to any word of caution, a lifestyle packed with loud sound bytes is all set to give birth to a deaf generation. Starting from cellphones, Yahoo chats, FMs, discman and car stereos to music in the malls, discotheques, blaring televisions and now the iPod ? youngsters today live amid a whirlpool of noise. And the trend has set the alarm bells ringing. 

 A Telegraph-Mode survey backed by reports from doctors, sociologists and experts ? who strongly disapprove of the acquired listening habits of the new young Indian ? reveals that the situation is deafening, with a grim and scary future in sight. The poll says that 93 per cent of those surveyed in the 16-26 age group feel that sound is highly stimulating and can charge up a person. Sixty per cent prefer their music loud, while 44 per cent feel disoriented without music or noise around them. 

 The writing, it seems, is on the wall. Senior ENT specialist Shantanu Banerjee says that in the last two years, there has been a significant five per cent rise in patients approaching him with such problems. A noisy lifestyle and such aggressive listening habits can cause more harm than one can even think of. Someone who is 16 today ? with severe and continuous noise exposure ? is likely to become near-deaf by the time he is 36. What is worse, he adds, is that the incurable nerve-damage hearing loss takes place over a period of time. Initially, it begins with the patient becoming short of hearing by 10-15 decibels. But it gradually leads to dangerous levels of severe hearing loss, Banerjee adds. 

 Banerjee recalls that over two decades ago, when the Metro rail in Calcutta was under construction, several of his patients complained of hearing loss and discomfort. But hearing problems among youngsters ? evolving out of such lifestyle noise intake ? is a recent phenomenon. 

 Arup Banerjee, medical officer, ENT, who has been in this field for the last two decades, says that more and more youngsters are complaining of a constant buzzing or ringing sound in their ears. Twenty years ago, I had one such young patient, today I have 20 a month, he says. 

 The impact of loud sound is aggravated by other life-style related problems. 

 Todays generation has unhealthy food habits. Youngsters gorge on junk food which results in unsaturated fat that causes the narrowing of blood vessels, adding to the hearing problem, Shantanu Banerjee says. 

 Also, living in an incessant cauldron of noise causes irritability, heart problems, blood pressure problems and less sleep. In fact, this may be the reason 31 per cent in the age group of 16-21 have frequent headaches, while 24 per cent of youngsters suffer from sleeplessness and irritability. 

 But all this doesnt bother Sushma Bhardwaj, a first-year zoology student in Bangalore. Loud music, she claims, distracts her from the root-realities of ugly domestic sounds. If she is at home, Sushma dislikes the sounds of her maid cursing away while washing the utensils and banging them on the sink. Sushma counters the clamour by listening to music. Her Walkman works as the magic wall and she merrily carries on with whatever she is doing. And no, the music doesnt disturb her. On the contrary, it gives me a happy backdrop and works as a catalyst to enable me to proceed with my work at hand, she says. The immediate reality around me is blurred and I am able to create my personal realm.

 Sushma is no exception. Most of her contemporaries are unaware of the fact that if the delicate hair-nerves of the ear are assaulted by loud sound vibrations, noise-induced hearing loss may occur. And even when they are warned that the average decibel level for human ears is below 85 decibels ? whereas the noise level that they encounter is significantly more ? they contend that life, after all, is a risky business. 

 So 24-year old Sanjay Ramachandra, who is pursuing an MBA degree and stays alone in Delhi, introduces himself as a good-life freak who loves his music loud. Sound bytes, he explains, give you another perspective to what you are doing. For instance, when I skate in the morning, I love the blaring music in my ears. It lends a cinematic edge to every turn I take, every step I repeat.

 Ramachandra doesnt realise that prolonged and regular exposure, even to everyday noise levels, can cause serious damage. In a country like India, as Dipanjan Roy, New Delhi-based medical epidemiologist, points out, noise levels in a crowded place can be as high as 90 decibels, while the average decibel level for human ears is below 85 decibels. 

 Something as common as an electric shaver or a food processor can average 85 decibels. And the consequences can be a slight but permanent hearing loss (provided the exposure is over an eight-hour period). Sensitive individuals may experience hearing loss even at 70 decibels. Rock concerts can reach 120 decibels and may cause damage in 30 minutes. 

 But who cares? In Mumbai, Sudha Srinivasan, 23, goes to a discotheque thrice a week, and stays on for at least three-and-a-half hours. And she is not alone. According to the survey, when youngsters across India go to a discotheque, 70 per cent prefer to stay there for at least three to four hours. 

 By the time Sudha is back home, its late evening and time for her to chat with her circle of friends. Post-dinner, its either a film on the VCD or the latest computer game that she borrows from the local video parlour. Finally when she goes to bed, she has her discman playing with the headphones plugged into her ears. If she happens to wake up, she switches it off. Or else, it just plays on through the night. 

 The mornings are no quieter. The discman and a cellphone are constant companions ? even while she is studying. Her parents say that she behaves like a zombie without her discman. She loves watching TV at a high volume and, of late, her parents have begun to worry because they are having to shout to talk to her, though Sudha denies that she has any difficulty in hearing. With an already identifiable 17 per cent of people ? in the age group of 22-26 ? complaining of a buzzing or ringing sound in their ears, Sudhas parents fear is not unfounded. 

 Take Panchali Mitra, a 23-year-old civil engineer. She had been sensing a ringing sound in her ears for a while, but hadnt given it much thought. But she ? and her family ? realised that the problem was serious when her brother called long-distance recently and Panchali could hardly hear him. The doctor says the problem lies in Panchalis listening habits. Three-and-a-half-hours of Walkman every day, two hours of transcription of a Spanish teaching aid programme for an NGO, and about seven hours ? thrice a week ? at a discotheque have left her not only with indigestion problems and irritability but also severe hearing problems. 

 Its a dangerously noisy life that these youngsters are leading today and I can tell you we dont have to wait too long to see the consequences. Its here for all to see, warns Arup Banerjee. 

 The reality is indeed grim. The survey shows that 93 per cent of youngsters like music playing in a car, taxi or an auto, while 59 per cent of the younger population have a Walkman or a discman as their daily companion. Loud and powerful sounds, they say, serve as a useful blanket to ward off unwarranted noises. According to Calcutta-based sociologist Basabi Chakraborty, youngsters are in desperate search of stress busters, and sound bytes serve as one of the best options. 

 Cyber chat sessions or a Dolby sound system, the young claim, help them to find the beat to their living. What they are unaware of is that in the midst of all this noise, 30 to 40 per cent of the 16,000 sensory receptor hair cells in the organ of corti can be destroyed before any noticeable amount of loss of hearing occurs. 

 Sociologists and environmentalists contend that such attitudinal change is a consequence of a radical and quick social makeover. Todays youngsters are desperate to cling to an image that can make them feel upbeat. Hindi films ? emphasised by multiplexes ? highlight the aspirational qualities of living. And sound, they point out, is an inevitable part of a good life, giving them an illusory sense of comfort. 

 The listening habits of youngsters have changed drastically over the past couple of years. A major reason is the nuclear family structure. The child grows up alone and seeks forms of entertainment that can make him or her feel less lonely, reasons Madhumati Dutta, environmentalist and professor of economics at the Bengal Engineering and Science University, Shibpur. Basically technology helps social isolation and in fact enhances it. 

 Dutta points out that while India has advanced technologically, laws and regulations have not evolved sufficiently to counter related problems. What makes the trend ? of such Western lifestyle noises ? worse in a country like ours is that we are already victims of passive noise intake, she says. And Dutta holds that noise is also an expression of machismo or bravado. If you have noticed, youngsters on a bike often enjoy their bikes roaring. 

 For the young Indian recklessly zooming through a tangle of sound bytes, the future may come as a rude shock. And even if the consequences then are loud enough, the deaf generation may have to learn a sign language to make any sense of it.

 GUN FIRES AGAIN

 Old soldiers, lore has it, fade away. But the controversy over the Bofors gun refuses to do that. It has risen Phoenix-like with the Central Bureau of Investigation asking the British Crown Prosecution Service to defreeze the accounts held by Mr Ottavio Quattrocchi in London. The matter has created quite a stir in Indian political and legal circles. But the issues need to be looked at bereft of passion and sentiment. Under Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence, Mr Quattrocchi is innocent till he has been proved guilty. Suspicion cannot be a reason for punishment. The fact of the matter is that nothing has been proved against Mr Quattrocchi despite twenty years of investigation. Yet he remains under the shadow of suspicion. Under the circumstances, not allowing him access to his money kept in legal bank accounts in London does appear to be a trifle unfair. Even if, for argument?s sake, it is assumed that Mr Quattrocchi has ill-gotten gains from the sale of the Bofors gun, it is highly unlikely that he would keep that money in a legal bank account in London. Both the available evidence and common sense suggest that there are no valid grounds to keep Mr Quattrocchi?s London accounts frozen. India?s apex court should accept this reality.

 Whatever be the legal aspects of the matter, what is undeniable is that Bofors is a very emotive label in India. Given this context, the CBI and the government of India could have acted with a little more finesse. Government agencies and the relevant government departments spoke in different voices. The prime minister?s office threw out hints that it was not aware of what was going on. All these only served to provoke the opposition to reopen the Bofors case and point to the usual suspects. The CBI must have known the political implications of what it was doing, and the least it could have done was to keep the government in the loop so that the damage control would have looked less ham-handed. Exactly the opposite actually happened. The CBI behaved as if it was undertaking a covert operation; once the defreezing became known, it tried to duck the responsibility and passed the buck to the politicians. The latter, instead of playing with a straight bat, over-reacted. The upshot has been the resurrection of a cause c?l?bre that had died a natural death. Nobody quite knows the whole truth about Bofors; hence politicians react to smoke signals.

 NEW SPIRIT

 It may be premature to celebrate the birth of a brave new order in Bengal. But the failure of yet another bandh the second in less than a week is surely a sign of significant change. It suggests that the people have finally overcome their fear of the politics of intimidation. What is more, it signals a new determination to defy this brand of politics. Given Bengals track record of violence during bandhs, this is a brave step forward. And it has little to do with the capacity of any particular political party to create panic and chaos. It does not take too many people to disrupt public life or to unleash violence. Thus, the peoples decision to defy the bandh call on Tuesday has nothing to do with the size or strength of a party such as the Socialist Unity Centre of India or the Naxalite outfits which called it. Signs of this new spirit of defiance were evident even last weekend, when the Trinamool Congress had called a bandh. Tragic though it was, the death of a government employee in a bomb attack on a bus in north Bengal during the Trinamool-sponsored bandh captured the new spirit of courage.

 However, it would be over-optimistic to expect the politicians to completely change their old ways. The strike called by leftist trade unions on December 14 is yet another proof that parties of all hues take to the same discredited methods in order to impose their will on the people. Whether the people can go about their normal work on December 14 as well will depend largely on the chief minister, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. The availability of public transport helped the people reject the latest bandh calls. Mr Bhattacharjee has said that his government has the same policy for dealing with all bandhs. That policy will be on trial on December 14. There is another important message in the peoples growing defiance of the politics of coercion. The last two bandhs were called to protest against the governments action over the proposed automobile project in Singur. The people are clearly impatient with the politicians habit of discarding dialogue for street fights. Violence over the Singur issue is just as disruptive as the lefts strike call on industrial issues. Democracy offers various options for dissent and legitimate protest. Democratic options do not always give quick or satisfactory results. But that is no justification for reducing democracy to street politics.

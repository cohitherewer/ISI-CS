 LEAD ROLE

 Tainted politicians are so common in India that they are almost accepted as part of the system. When they are indicted or convicted by a court, it is only an embarrassment for their parties or the governments they belong to and a political weapon for their opponents. But Mr Shibu Sorens conviction in a murder case raises some disturbing questions about how some politicians corrupt the system and also fall victim to it. Mr Sorens political career may be said to represent that process. Here is a man who was once an iconic figure of the Jharkhand movement, which captured the imagination of the tribal people in different parts of the country. The peoples reverence for him was reflected in the honorific, Guruji, by which he is known among the states political workers and common people alike. But his rise in national politics in later years became increasingly entangled with charges of corruption and murky political deals. His conviction, therefore, exposes the vicious side of the Indian political system.

 The prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, had little choice but to ask Mr Soren to resign as a Union minister. But he may still regret his decision to re-induct Mr Soren in the ministry after the latter had quit it in the wake of another court case. The Congress leadership will now have to deal with the fall-out of the episode on Jharkhands politics. Mr Soren has been the chairman of the steering committee of the United Progressive Alliance in the state. Obviously, it would be risky for the UPA to continue to project Mr Soren as the face of the alliance in Jharkhand. And, despite his conviction, he may continue to be the sole leader of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha for quite some time. His exit from the Union cabinet may have saved the prime minister a major political embarrassment. But the UPA faces a political and a moral dilemma in Jharkhand that may be more difficult to contend with.

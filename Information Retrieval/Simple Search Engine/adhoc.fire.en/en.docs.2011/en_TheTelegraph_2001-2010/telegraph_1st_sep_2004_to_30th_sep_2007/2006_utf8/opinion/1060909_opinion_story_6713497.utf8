 Passenger profile

 Sir Close on the heels of the harassment of Indian passengers by Dutch authorities comes the news that another Indian was ordered off an Alitalia plane because he did not fit the profile of the hallowed business-class traveller. I wonder what the criteria are fair-skin and fluency in English maybe? Will Indians still not protest against such discrimination on grounds of colour and race by airlines and immigration authorities the world over? Perhaps most Indians love to side with the white man as long as other Indians are at the receiving end.

 Yours faithfully,

 Savage law

 Sir The temerity shown by a kangaroo court in Nadia when it pronounced a death sentence on a man for stealing a cow is alarming (Court kills for cow, Sept 5). The man may have been a habitual cattle-lifter and a criminal, but that does not give anybody the right to take his life by taking the law into their own hands. How could such an incident be allowed to take place in the so-called progressive state of West Bengal? Did it ever occur to the onlookers or those who actively took part in lynching the thief that they might meet a similar fate if they fall foul with the ringleaders of the village who preside over this court? The sub-divisional police officer of the area reportedly said that his force was trying to identify both the people who killed the man and those who witnessed it. One hopes that the members of the jury are not exonerated owing to their political clout. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Safikul Mahaldar had to pay with his life for a petty theft. Instead of being taken into custody, the shalishi meeting announced that he should be hacked to death in full view of the other villagers. Subsequently, a mob was allowed to carry out the execution with sticks and scythes. About 20 villagers pounced on the poor man and killed him brutally. Not even one among the bystanders came to his rescue. This is an instance of barbaric justice and so the question arises: are we still living in a savage society? Who gave the authority to the village courts to carry out such a sentence? Since a large number of people were involved in the lynching, the case just might be closed for want of permissible evidence or witnesses. But surely, the police can arrest the shalishi judges as they were the ones who ordered the lynching and ensure that they are punished.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Poverty and theft are aberrations in the civilized society that we live in. But the shocking truth is that kangaroo courts still exist and are even successful in handing down primitive justice to rural litigants, thereby lightening the huge backlog of cases before the formal courts. The Nadia incident reflects the failure of the law-and-order machinery of the state, the elders preference for the shalishi concept, and the administrations inability to spread education and awareness among people. If such arbitrary verdicts continue, the peoples faith in law will soon be eroded.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir I would shudder to live in an Indian village, where, it seems, young men are regularly killed by popular sanction, and elderly women banished for being witches. Rural India is a scary place to live in, with people having no idea of freedom. It is time malpractices endorsed by the village elders are declared illegal and the perpetrators punished. Only those who have a minimum level of education should become elders, so that their judgments are not products of primitive ideas and superstitions. 

 Yours faithfully,

Dorothy Ramathal, Calcutta

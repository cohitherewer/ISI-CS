 Fatal sting 

 Sir With the outbreak of dengue and chikungunya in many parts of India, the mosquito is now holding centrestage in India. (Capital with toll at 16, Oct 5). States as far removed as Delhi and Kerala have been hit badly. The deadly outbreaks with such frightening regularity show that nothing much has been done by the health authorities to ensure the safety of the common man. Come monsoons and the mosquito menace gets worse. The government, in the name of exterminating mosquito-larvae, adopts some routine measures but nothing comes of them. The negligence on the part of health officials is unpardonable. Tropical cities like Singapore have tackled the mosquito menace by maintaining the desired standards of hygiene. Why should the Indian officials then fail repeatedly in this regard? 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Kamat, Bardez, Goa 

 Sir With members of the prime ministers family getting infected with dengue, one hopes that civic authorities would now be more active in exterminating the dangerous virus. The unchecked spread of the disease in the capital and elsewhere is a matter of concern for the nation. Foreign dignitaries and tourists will now think twice before planning their visits to India. What lies at the root of the problem is the lack of hygiene and civic sense among the people. If this attitude does not change, then civic authorities will not succeed in getting rid of the threats posed by the disease .

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, Calcutta

 Sir Delhi is in the grip of dengue and it would be wise for other states to take steps to prevent a similar outbreak. A few simple steps could be implemented to achieve this. The water tanks in trains departing from Delhi should be sanitized. The patients already infected with the virus should be kept in separate wards and areas around the hospitals fumigated.

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir The spread of dengue in Delhi is not surprising, given the unhygienic conditions prevailing in the streets and lanes of the capital. The blocked sewers on roads in front of the municipal corporation office is symptomatic of the apathy of the officials. Worse, the helpline number issued by the corporation to dispense information about the outbreak has been of little use as well.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhash Chandra Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir The editorial, High alert (Oct 6), has correctly pointed out that dengue has proved to be a great leveller the prime ministers relatives along with hundreds of ordinary Delhiites have fallen victims to the same disease. While health officials are doing their best to contain the scourge, the health minister, Anbumani Ramadoss, has reportedly denied the seriousness of the outbreak and declared that the situation is under control. Had the outbreak been declared as an epidemic, then more stringent measures could have been adopted to battle the disease. With the toll rising in the capital,the authorities must recognize the gravity of the situation and take some urgent steps to bring the situation under control.

 Yours faithfully,

Kangayam R. Rangaswamy, Waunakee, US

 Sir The worsening health situation in Kerala and Delhi should force the health ministry to seek expert help from the developed world. Vaccines should be imported from the United States of America and distributed free of cost to health centres in India. After all, one of the reasons for the number of dengue deaths in the country is that the Indian health infrastructure is woefully inadequate to contain such pandemics.

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sekar, Nalco Nagar, Orissa 

 Sir Dengue has become an annual event in many parts of the country. Yet our health centres have not equipped themselves with the necessary equipment for detecting and treating the dreaded disease. The indifference on the part of those responsible for protecting our lives is appalling. Perhaps the only way to bring erring officials to their toes is to install the fear of judicial punishment in them. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Sir The south of Calcutta has been declared as one of the zones susceptible to dengue (City south found dengue prone, Oct 6). This is not surprising given the conditions prevailing in these parts. During the monsoons, rain waters that flood the streets are not drained properly. They stagnate in potholes and open drains that have now become breeding grounds for mosquitoes. The municipal authorities have not bothered to clear and disinfect the sewerage system in spite of repeated pleas from the citizens who are now living in the shadow of an epidemic.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Ghosh, Calcutta

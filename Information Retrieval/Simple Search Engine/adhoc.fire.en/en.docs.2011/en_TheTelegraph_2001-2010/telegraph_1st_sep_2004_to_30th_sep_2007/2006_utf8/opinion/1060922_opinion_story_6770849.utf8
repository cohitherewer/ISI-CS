The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 When the size matters

Bookwise

 Small and compact 

Sensible, scholarly books still get published but 

the market rewards the sort you can judge by the cover. You can describe the two 

categories as up-market the one for the intellectual elite, and down-market, 

which is entertainment for the common reader. Or, you could break it down further 

into the number game: the former, with limited print, runs as low as 500 copies 

but is costly; the latter usually has an initial print run of at least 5000 copies 

but is priced in the Rs 100-150 range for the mass market. 

Ideally, the publisher would like to mix the two 

but this does not happen here: you either go for the top end or the lower, depending 

on how well you know your segment of the market and the key players who operate 

the levers of demand. Hence the question: how do the two systems work and can 

they ever meet as they have done in the big companies in the West because of the 

retailing chain stores?

Take the top end, or the scholarly books, which could 

be anything from purely educational books to reference manuals like dictionaries 

of different kinds or serious fiction. These books are addressed to a small worldwideclientele. 

But the clientele, although spread across the English speaking world, can be identified 

either through direct mailing of publicity brochures or by negotiating marketing 

arrangements with distributors who take care of sales in the territories reserved 

for them. The important point is that this market can be identified and reached, 

unlike that of many other hit-or-miss titles where it is diffused over a wide 

area. Also, although print runs are small, price is not a restraining factor because 

such books are published to satisfy a specific need. 

Mass market books are a different story. First, the 

down market is clearly now a sub-division of the entertainment industry glitz, 

sex, romance and violence do very well because there is a nexus between them and 

sales. Essentially these are non-books or packaged soap books that can spin off 

into films or television serials. It is the mass entertainment potential of this 

fiction that commands a price. Because of the up-front money, the print runs have 

to be huge too if costs have to be recovered. But the price has to be pegged down 

to seduce the impulse buyer. 

Books are now products to be merchandized like any 

other commodity. This product must be seen and talked about. This means hype 

book releases, talk-shows, meet-the-author and the rest. But the market for popular 

books cannot be identified in the same way as with scholarly books. And this market 

can be whimsical because there are no rules here. 

So, can the two ends meet? Only if you have huge resources 

like in the West where different companies can operate within one large holding 

company. In India we can have different divisions with a house and that is about 

all. But it leads to marketing problems resulting in increased overhead costs 

that is not desirable. It is best to remain small and compact and make sure that 

you get reasonable returns.

 CAMPUS BEAT

 Centres of higher education should cease to be death-traps for students and teachers. The Supreme Courts acceptance of the Lyngdoh committees recommendations on student-union elections is an expression of a quiet determination that should perhaps have been more the governments than the courts. The formation of the committee, under the courts order, was itself an acknowledgement of the corrupting influence of politics inside the campus. Not surprisingly, the adoption of the recommendations has been unwelcome news to student bodies which fight proxy battles, kill recalcitrant teachers and recruit members for larger political formations with gusto. The legal instruction, which has to be implemented with immediate effect by governments and educational institutions, tries to ensure that campus elections are held by the students, for the students. The order restricts candidature to students alone by setting age-limits for contestants and by linking eligibility to attendance and performance. To further liberate this activity from interference, it forbids acceptance of funds from political parties and seeks to deglamorize the process by putting a ceiling on expenditure and placing strictures on the conduct of candidates. They can neither count more than Rs 5,000 as their electoral expenditure nor leave defaced walls on the campus after elections without risking disqualification. At a time when student leaders proclaim their political inclinations through the internet, the prescribed use of hand-painted posters for propaganda may even sound medieval.

 The question is whether such prescriptions will serve as judicious means to the end. Obviously, much depends on the proper implementation of the measures, which appear strikingly similar to those which have failed to discipline candidates for Indias legislatures. In the absence of a regulatory body, there is little reason to believe that the rules will be adhered to with any strictness within the campus. There is also no clear directive on the supervision of the electoral process. Will teachers be expected to continue risking their necks in overseeing the process? The most disconcerting is the fact that there is no precondition placed on the political affiliation of student unions. If these bodies continue to be run by student members of political parties, is there any hope of keeping the electoral process free?

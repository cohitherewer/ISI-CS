 Letters to Editor

 Mean streets

 Sir ? How can a government that promises to be ?of the people, for the people and by the people? drive out the homeless from the little dwellings that they managed to gain for themselves (?Pavement-dweller count up?, April 20)? It is a disgrace for a growing, multiplex-packed metro to have thousands living in the streets in penury. It is easy to blame the street-dwellers for the filth they spread, but none of us makes any efforts to rehabilitate them, because that calls for a lot of sensitivity and hard work. We have indeed reduced the state to a mockery of democracy. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Subhanjan Sengupta, Durgapur 

 Watered down

 Sir ? Earlier it was Arundhati Roy who had tried her luck as social activist ? perhaps to salvage her downsliding popularity. Now it is Aamir Khan who is vying for the same kind of attention (?Enter: Aamir the activist?, April 15). So far the Narmada Bachao Andolan was devoid of any political tag; it was more a social outrage. But with Khan entering the scene, it will soon get a political dimension and the top leaders will make a beeline to claim him for their political ideology. Medha Patkar?s spirited struggle will lose its relevance in the process. The social activists should discard people whose main objective is to gain cheap popularity. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

 Sir ? It seems that his rebel and reformist image in the recent film Rang De Basanti has inspired Aamir Khan to speak out for the cause of the oppressed and the displaced. Yet one wonders where this voice was when, some years ago, he had worked in the Kutch region, shooting for his film, Lagaan, where, for years, people have been hoping for the Narmada water. Social service is not a hobby that can be indulged in at one?s leisure and discarded when more important work beckons. Before making empty promises to the displaced people, Khan should look into the technicalities of both the Sardar Sarovar project and the protest against it. Instead of endorsing products like Coke, which has polluted the river Parvati in Madhya Pradesh, he should be more consistent in both speech and action. After all, charity begins at home, not in the Jantar Mantar.

 Yours faithfully, 

R. Singh, Vadodara

 Sir ? It was good to see Aamir Khan using his celebrity status for a noble cause, albeit a little late. It would be interesting to know what prompted his conscience to be moved by the NBA, Bhopal gas victims and Plachimada protesters all at the same time. Will he be able to continue his support with the same zeal? If he leaves midway, it will not harm the NBA as much as it will his own image. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The participation of Aamir Khan in the agitation against the Sardar Sarovar dam at Jantar Mantar should not be taken too seriously. It is a short-term interest and does not have to mean that doing Rang De Basanti has awakened his soul. Khan has a long way to go if he really wants to prove that besides being a talented actor, he is also sensitive to social issues. The way he landed up at Jantar Mantar to meet the NBA activists and spoke to the media shows that he was not fully aware of the movement. The attendance of some of the actors and the director of Rang De Basanti at the agitation shows that it was just another excuse to promote the movie. 

 Yours faithfully,

Khalid Pervez, Calcutta

 Sir ? Aamir Khan?s gesture of solidarity towards the NBA activists and Bhopal gas victims is a welcome sign. He appears to be the conscience of the world of glamour. He should now start a Bharat Bachao Andolan.

 Yours faithfully,

 Suman Barthakur, Guwahati

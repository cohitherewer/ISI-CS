 Fight it out

 Sir ? The report, ?Wind blows for fighter girls?(March 11), highlights the obsolete mindset of the Indian air force. After nearly sixty years of independence and quite a few wars and peacetime operations, the IAF is still debating on whether women are qualified enough to fly fighter aircraft despite their proven efficiency in the task. The attitude makes a mockery of professionalism as it confuses culture and social custom with ability. The discrimination evident in specifying a ?trifurcation? board for men and a ?bifurcation? board for women, has ensured that women can fly only transporters and helicopters. Not allowing women to go into fighter aircraft squadrons is a denial of democratic rights and does no credit to the country. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? It is disconcerting to find that society still applies a different set of rules when it comes to women professionals (?Lonely impulse of delight?, March 12). Indeed, ?merit is?not a deciding factor in allotting roles?. Otherwise, why should women be deprived of the opportunity of becoming fighter pilots if they have proved themselves to be as capable as their male counterparts? It is not too difficult to understand the logic behind this discriminatory policy. It is essential for society to preserve the age-old representation of women as nurturers. The image of women as fighters is a threat to the patriarchal setup. Women?s freedom to fly, both literally and metaphorically, have to be curbed to prevent the possibility of women becoming more powerful than men. They are thus coerced into roles that they have long outgrown. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The IAF?s policy of excluding women from becoming fighter pilots may not be as illogical as it sounds if one remembers the risks they run if captured in enemy territory. Given the war of attrition with India?s neighbours, this is a highly probable scenario. One only needs to recall the severely mutilated body of a captured soldier that was returned to India during the Kargil war to imagine the horrors awaiting women pilots in a hostile neighbourhood. 

 The threat to a woman warrior is so grave that it once forced Soviet women pilots to decide on jumping to their deaths in case of an adversity to prevent their capture by enemies during World War II. Are Indian women prepared to take the same decision? Perhaps the IAF should throw open the post and see how many women consciously make the choice. It is unlikely there will be too many Noor Inayat Khans.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Debarring women from flying fighter aircraft is not only an affront to their capacities, but also to the training standards of the IAF. It also sends out a negative message to women who aspire to serve their country.

 Yours faithfully, 

Anirban Rudra, Calcutta

 Sir ? The result of the daily SMS poll published in The Telegraph on March 12 (?Should women be allowed to fly fighter planes??) was surprising. Even though a small percentage ? 15.38 per cent ? of the participants are not in favour of allowing women to fly fighter planes, one wonders what argument could they have to support their opinion. Do they believe that women are incapable of handling the job? 

 Yours faithfully, 

Manjusha Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? When Indian women have an inspiring precedence in Kalpana Chawla, who flew and died in a space shuttle, why should the IAF think twice before allowing them to join the rank of fighter pilots? It is time that the cultural prejudices are done away with. Apart from biological constraints, if any, there should be no hindrance to women flying fighter aircraft. As it is, women?s representation in the air force is itself deplorable, with only 700 women in a force of 1.1 lakh pilots. This inequality is reflective of the cultural barriers that have kept women out. The bravehearts should now take up cudgels against the inequitable system.

 Yours faithfully,

A.K. Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is disheartening to find a gender bias in the Indian army. When women have beaten men in almost every sphere of performance, such discrimination is an insult to their abilities. The air force should amend its policy. This would be a fitting, though belated, Women?s Day gift to the women pilots.

 Yours faithfully,

Joyeeta Dey, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir ? Malvika Singh is wrong in blaming the British for Partition (?Blasting through peace?, March 10). It was the Gandhi-Nehru-Jinnah trio that was instrumental in carrying out this dastardly act. The principal architect of Partition, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was fully aware of the severe repercussions that would follow, but to him the nation?s interests were subservient to those of Jawaharlal Nehru. Holding the British responsible for converting India into a third world country too is unfair. India would have become a superpower by now had our leaders not brazenly looted its resources since independence and created a system of governance based on corruption. Surely Singh realizes that the only way of putting an end to cross-border terrorism backed by Pakistan, of which the latest example is the bomb blast at Varanasi, is to completely destroy the terrorist camps located in Pakistan occupied Kashmir. But this requires courage, something our leaders do not possess. Gandhian philosophy has transformed India into a nation of ineffectual wimps, to be regularly harassed by a neighbour that is one-fifth its size.

 Yours faithfully,

 Jayanta Kumar Dutt, Calcutta

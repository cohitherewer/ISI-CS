 NEW STORM BREWING

 Gwynne Dyer

 We just ignore them, said the man at the think -tank in Beijing, a senior adviser to the Chinese foreign ministry, and burst out laughing. He laughed because it is a long and daunting list of people to ignore. He has to ignore the American journalists and academics who predict an eventual war with China, the US armed forces, who are transferring more and more hardware to the western Pacific and the Bush administration officials whose search for allies in Asia to contain China culminated in not-quite-an-alliance with India. He also has to ignore their counterparts in the Chinese military-industrial complex, who try to use all that as evidence that China must pour much more resources into defence. He is a busy man.

 The reason he deliberately ignored them all is because taking the American threat seriously and trying to match it would just mean playing into the hands of the hawks on both sides. There is no objective reason that makes a US-Chinese clash inevitable, but preparing for it, or even talking too much about it, actually makes it more possible.

 I heard the same argument from half-a-dozen other influential foreign policy analysts in Beijing, which should have been reassuring. It would have been, if not for the fact that every one of those experts, having patiently explained that there were no threats on the horizon that could deflect Chinas peaceful rise to great-power status, then added: except Japan. That is quite an exception, since Japan has the worlds second-biggest economy and is right on Chinas doorstep.

 Time for trouble

 Which brings us to Shinzo Abe, the new prime minister of Japan. Elected as the leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, he is the youngest man to occupy the office since the Second World War. The people around Abe are uncompromising nationalists who insist that Japan must become a normal country, which means that it should stop apologizing for the second World War, rewrite school textbooks omitting all the material about war guilt and Japanese atrocities, and rewrite the peace constitution so that Japans euphemistically titled Self-Defence Forces can legally become ordinary armed forces, able to be deployed overseas. 

 This group, long a minority faction within the LDP, first gained power with the choice of outgoing prime minister Junichiro Koizumi as leader, but Abe takes a harder line. He has even said that it is not necessarily unconstitutional for Japan to develop a nuclear deterrent and advocates even closer military ties with America, and worries aloud about the intentions of a stronger China. He not only irritates the Chinese, whose relations with Japan are at the lowest point in decades; he actually frightens them. No sane Japanese wants to turn the countrys giant neighbour and biggest trading partner into an enemy. But it wouldnt be the first time that a government has talked itself into a needless military confrontation. 

 Symbolism matters. If Abe continues Koizumis habit of making annual visits to the Yasukuni shrine which is devoted to the souls of Japans millions of war dead then many Chinese will conclude that he is a threat. Koizumis official visits outraged people all over Asia whose countries were occupied by Japan during the war, but the Chinese, in particular, went ballistic.

 Shinzo Abe has refused to say whether he will copy Koizumi, but he visited the shrine privately as recently as last spring. If he visits it again as prime minister, Sino-Japanese relations will get even worse, and it will get still harder for the sensible people in Beijing to ignore the rhetoric of the American and Chinese hawks. With a little bad luck, we could be as little as a couple of years away from the start of a new Cold War in Asia.

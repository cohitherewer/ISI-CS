 JUST CHILDREN

 In what sense does childhood end at eighteen? Or is the attaining of majority in age a purely legal matter without being laden with cultural and sentimental significance? Just a cursory glance at the laws that will be affected by bringing uniformity to the legal definition of a minor as a person below the age of 18 years shows that the stakes are considerably more than merely legal. Such a revaluation, and its implementation in law, would have to look hard at Indian societys range of attitudes to the nature and function of childhood. After all, the ministry of women and children the pairing is significant has invoked the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child in its petition to the law ministry. And the UNCRC talks about a child and not about something as impersonally legal as a minor. Its preamble starts with the assumption that childhood is entitled to special care and assistance, but also admits, however imperfectly, of cultural difference on the one hand, and of the childs evolving capacities on the other, to which this special status has to be adapted. Are sex-work and domestic labour, for instance, equally harmful for all persons under eighteen anywhere in the world, and hence equally unjust? Is an eight-year-old killer as morally culpable as a 17-year-old murderer, and therefore punishable under the same juvenile justice law? 

 Thinking about majority must remain distinct from, and yet happen in conjunction with, thinking about the age of (sexual) consent and of criminal responsibility. This is not only a question of physical capacity or vulnerability, but also of the capacity to understand the nature of right and wrong, and of contracts, and then to make decisions or act on that understanding. The measuring of these capacities in individual children would depend on regarding them as embodied subjects existing in their specific social and cultural realities rather than depending on a universal notion of what children ought to be like. This becomes, ethically and legally, most tricky in the three realms of sex, work and war. The extent to which children can be responsible owners and users of their own bodies and minds will determine the nature of the rights that they are entitled to, and the manner in which they might be allowed to exercise these rights in their own lives and in the lives of others. The matter is really as complicated as that. Childhood, in law and in life, is most often a very adult affair.

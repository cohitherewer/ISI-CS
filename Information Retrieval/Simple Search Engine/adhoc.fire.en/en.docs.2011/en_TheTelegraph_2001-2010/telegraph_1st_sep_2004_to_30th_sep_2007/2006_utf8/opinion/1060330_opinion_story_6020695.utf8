 Letters to Editor

 Man behind the party

 Sir ? The death of Anil Biswas is unfortunate for his family and party comrades (?Party chooses Biswas successor?, March 28). His sudden demise at a time when the assembly elections in West Bengal are just round the corner must have dealt a rude blow to the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in the state. However, since the CPI (M) has always worked as an organization, it should not be too difficult for an experienced leader to smoothly don the mantle of the state party secretary. In this critical hour, the CPI(M) must be in desperate need of a person who will be able to conduct party affairs with ?lan. Yet, Anil Biswas?s shoes will be difficult to fit into.

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? Anil Biswas?s donation of his body after death is an exemplary act that is worthy of emulation by the leaders of all parties. Taking the cue from them, ordinary citizens will be inspired to do the same, thus making more human bodies available for medical research and education.

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? I agree with the comment in the editorial, ?Old faithful? (March 27), that ?[Anil] Biswas will be a tough act to emulate?. His rise from an ordinary worker of the CPI(M) to the party general secretary in West Bengal, while remaining faithful to the ideology of the Stalinist school, is a wonder in these days of globalization. His deadpan style of speaking and his satiric comments will be sorely missed. 

 Yours faithfully,

Amitava Banerjee, Chennai

 Sir ? Anil Biswas?s demise was shocking because it was so sudden. But one cannot help wondering why, in spite of being a communist leader, he was admitted to an elite private nursing home after his cerebral attack, and not one of the government hospitals, or even the Woodburn ward of the SSKM hospital. Does this not go against the Marxist ideal of equality that the CPI(M) leaders profess to live by? The communist leadership?s message perhaps is: ?Don?t do as we do, do as we say.? 

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Warrior queen

 Sir ? One cannot play to Lata Mangeshkar?s tune on her opposition to the proposed Peddar Road flyover in Mumbai (?Flyover faces Lata music?, March 28). No doubt she is one of the best things that ever happened to Indian music. But that cannot be the reason for scrapping a planned flyover which is supposed to benefit thousands of Mumbaikars. Any development project is bound to cause some inconvenience to people living in the construction area, but they always feel compensated by the benefits that they will enjoy once work is completed. As they say in sites in Calcutta, today?s pain is tomorrow?s gain. Mumbai?s increasing population has become a strain on the city?s infrastructure, and the roads in particular have to bear the brunt. Flyovers are a big help in reducing the pressure on the arterial roads of the city. Mangeshkar?s threat to move out of the city if the flyover comes up is rather selfish because it ignores public welfare. 

 Yours faithfully,

Aires Rodrigues, Mumbai

 Sir ? It is unbecoming of Lata Mangeshkar to protest against a project that would benefit most of the people of Mumbai. True, the privacy of buildings on both sides of a flyover is affected during the construction period. But the advantages supersede the disadvantages in the long run. The reasons that Mangeshkar is citing for opposing the proposed flyover would not stand scrutiny. The authorities concerned will surely have surveyed first whether the site falls in a seismological zone.

 The real reason behind the venerated singer?s protest is what she and her sister, Asha Bhosle, told the chief minister, Vilasrao Deshmukh five years ago ? the fear of compromising their privacy once motorists ride at a handshaking distance of their residence. But such a protest stinks of pettiness. For someone like Mangeshkar, it would have been more dignified to move quietly to another locality. Some have told her as much. But will she heed the advice?

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir ? The least that the government of Maharashtra can do for India?s nightingale is to honour her wish and stall the construction of the proposed Peddar Road flyover. Well past her youth, Mangeshkar surely deserves some peace and quiet. Besides, her objections are not all baseless as certain areas of Mumbai do fall in a seismological zone. If the flyover falls in such a region, the lives of the residents of the locality will be put in danger. As such, Mangeshkar might be doing a favour to the city by objecting to the flyover. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Asish Mukherjee, Calcutta

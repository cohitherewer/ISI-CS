 WHY WE REFUSE TO LEARN

 Vimala Ramachandran looks at the differing perceptions about ?motivation? among administrators, teachers and parents

 A job well done

 In a district of Rajasthan I asked a group of teachers who they thought was a ?motivated teacher?. After thinking for a while, one of them said: ?A ?motivated? teacher comes to school every day, does what he is told and provides the information the higher ups want!?

 I was puzzled with the answer. I probed further. Almost all believed that daily attendance and complying with orders and requests were reasonable indicators of motivation. A headmaster with a sense of humour said: ?We have five teachers in our school. One of them is a dakia, who responds to enquiries that come from above and dispatches data/information to the district or block office. The other is a halwai, who manages the mid-day meal. The third one is perpetually on training and the fourth is a clerk who has to maintain accounts and pay salaries. Who is left to manage five classes and teach around 200 children? One teacher!?

 I met two kinds of administrators. The first group was empathetic to teachers and talked about systemic issues that impact teaching and learning in schools. They did not see teachers as villains but cogs in a giant wheel that were trapped in a hierarchical and corrupt system. One officer admitted, ?Teachers are victims of the transfer and posting phenomenon. They have no security of tenure and... have to acquire godfathers for protection. Once they develop these contacts and links, there is no need for them to do their job seriously!?

 The second group saw teachers as shirkers and blamed them entirely for poor quality education. To this group a motivated teacher was one who was regular, did what he or she was told and was, by and large, compliant. One of the more sensitive lamented: ?Job satisfaction and morale are highly inter-related. To my mind, this requires a certain basic seriousness about what one is doing. Thereafter, the level of satisfaction or morale may decrease due to prevailing work conditions or other factors. But government schoolteachers lack this basic seriousness. There is a lot of dissatisfaction and frustration among them. Surprisingly, they do not seem interested enough to do anything about it.?

 Parents had a different view. A teacher who came regularly, stayed in the school for the stipulated time, did not use excessive force (beat, shout and punish) and taught with interest was, for them, a motivated teacher. Some educationists this author talked to argued that a motivated teacher was one who could communicate with the children, drew energy from interaction with children and was concerned about what and how much they were learning. Parents alone said that the ability of their children to learn to read and write and pass examinations was important. Ironically, administrators brushed learning aside ? it was incidental to the mountain of data they gathered and fed into the system. Enrolment, attendance, mid-day-meal distribution and participation in training programmes have become the indices of education.

 Discussions on motivation led to comparisons with private schools. Teachers, administrators and parents quickly pointed out that private schools attached great importance to discipline, regularity and good results in yearly as well as public examinations. Almost all the teachers I interacted with sent their own children to private schools. They admitted that irregular attendance of teachers was uncommon in private (aided and unaided) schools and that teachers taught for the stipulated hours. But when asked why government schools were different, most could not give a convincing answer. They ended up blaming the system.

 Ordinary citizens squarely blame the teachers, citing absenteeism, politicization of teachers? unions and, most important, lack of professional ethics. Teachers, on the other hand, argue that the system has pushed them to a point where they think it advisable to lie low and do what their higher-ups tell them to do. The more politically savvy and active teachers spend time and energy cultivating politicians and local networks. Contrary to popular perception, almost all of them admitted that ?motivation? is a dynamic feeling; it changes from time to time. They linked it to the larger environment in which they work and how this affected their sense of self-worth. 

 One panchayat leader narrated an interesting experience. ?If the family or community considers teaching a noble profession, the teacher will naturally be more motivated. When someone does their job well, their status in society increases. Kalyanpura village is in Chaksu block. Girls here were hardly sent to school. Their numbers were minimal. We started pehchan shala. The teacher appointed identified all the girls herself. She built a rapport with the community. Everyone was full of praise for her work. The villagers themselves organized her salary. She had to leave when she got married. A huge party was thrown for her and that day was called Balika Utsav (festival for girls). About 700 girls from all the nearby pehchan shalas participated. The villagers organized everything themselves. The function cost almost Rs 20,000!?

 Teachers complained about feeling demeaned when they were sent out to collect data or for door-to-door polio campaigns. They argued that their job was not to do research surveys and campaigns for the government and felt that when they had to do so it affected their social status. They valued justice and fair play. They were ready to work with administrators and political leaders who they felt were just, and appreciated and rewarded hard work.

 The government?s decision to hire contract teachers and parateachers was a further blow to their self-worth. They felt they were no longer discharging a unique, special duty and that even untrained hands could do what they had been doing hitherto. It was clear that motivation in this case, as in others, hinged on the emotional energy of people. Their skills and unique strengths, especially their status as professionals, are not appreciated and there is no positive affirmation and encouragement.

 Teacher motivation is a complex issue in India. There is virtually no incentive for teachers who go beyond the call of duty and empower their students to learn and move on in life. On the other hand, teachers who network with political leaders and local bureaucrats manage plum postings and, if they are lucky, teachers? awards too!

 Everyone ? the different categories of people we spoke to ? was of the opinion that 25 per cent to 30 per cent teachers are highly motivated and work very hard regardless of their personal circumstances. Another 30 per cent comply with all the formal requirements ? regularity, attendance, data on enrolment and retention, mid-day meal distribution and so on. These teachers have the potential but the system has worn them out. The remaining 40 per cent to 45 per cent can be categorized as ?indifferent?? they are just not motivated and really do not care.

 India is a large country. It is possible that the gap between the educationist?s perception of motivation and that of teachers, administrators and the larger community may be narrower in educationally advanced states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Himachal Pradesh. The nature of the problem in Rajasthan may be a far cry from the issues bothering West Bengal.

 But one thing is certain. Teacher motivation is definitely a huge issue in education and unless we, as a nation, decide to take it seriously, the future of our children is shaky. This is particularly grave when it comes to children living in diverse poverty situations and to those who depend on government schools.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 NO ONE IS ABOVE

 In a democracy, nobody is above the law. Yet in India, it is not possible to make complaints or allegations against a judge. This is an odd and old contradiction. A similar problem was mooted in the question, who guards the guards? How a judge is to be judged is a question of the same complexity. It is impossible to cut through this contradiction without a fundamental reform of the laws. Such a reform seems to be in the offing with the approval of the Union cabinet to the Judges (Inquiry) Bill, which will allow complaints to be lodged against members of the higher judiciary except the Chief Justice of India. The new bill will establish a five-judge National Judicial Council to hear complaints and charges against judges. This can be seen as a necessary step to confirm the blindness of justice before whom every one is equal. Members of the judiciary should, in fact, be the first to welcome the new bill and the setting up of the National Judicial Council.

 By convention and by law, the judiciary is enveloped in an aura of awe. This is created partly through the notion of contempt. The ordinary man or even the intelligent layman is never quite sure about what constitutes contempt of court. This uncertainty engenders a sense of fear, which is not healthy in a democracy. Members of the judiciary are not the only group to enjoy this kind of special protection. Legislators are also protected by the very dubious notion known as privilege. Any criticism of a legislator can be immediately booked under the rubric of breach of privilege. It is impossible to understand the necessity of this idea. It originated in the 17th century in England, when members of the House of Commons were fighting against the arbitrariness of a monarch. In a 21st-century democracy, it has the ring of irrelevance. It is somewhat axiomatic that in a democracy no one should enjoy any legal privileges which are not available to every member of society. The transgression of this principle pushes democracy towards undermining both freedom and equality. It curbs the freedom to speak without fear and makes some groups, by virtue of their occupation, more equal than others. Allowing complaints against judges will obviously be open to abuse like any other system. Abusers should be tried by the relevant laws of the land as should be those who, in the name of upholding justice, abuse justice.

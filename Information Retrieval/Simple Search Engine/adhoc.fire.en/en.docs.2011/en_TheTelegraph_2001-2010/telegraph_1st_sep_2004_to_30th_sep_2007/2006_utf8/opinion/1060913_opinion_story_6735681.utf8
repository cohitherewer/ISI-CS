 SHAKY BEGINNING

 The bitter experience with Jharkhand should make New Delhi wary of groups pushing for new states, writes Sumanta Sen

 Our identity is under threat, goes the cry whenever ethnic groups demand a state for themselves. So it was heard when the demand for a separate Jharkhand was raised, the demand ultimately got realized a few years ago. And, since then, it is being seen that those who had been anxious to protect their identity are now going all the way to get themselves identified with the mainstream culture, warts and all.

 The current crisis in the state has to be seen in this context. Defection, graft and so on are not new in Indian politics. But Jharkhand is an exception in that from its birth, the state has been plagued by such unsavoury aspects of Indian politics. Actually the germ had entered even earlier when leaders of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha were accused of accepting bribes from the Congress for voting in favour of the Narasimha Rao ministry. Then came the birth of Jharkhand, the falling out of Babulal Marandi with Arjun Munda and the spate of allegations that came with the split. Now Munda is facing the same kind of allegations.

 There is also Shibu Soren. He became a minister in the United Progressive Alliance, had to quit after serious charges were levelled against him, and is now back in the cabinet. In the interim period, he also became the chief minister of the state by claiming a majority he never had and had to resign within a fortnight. His successor, the present chief minister, also did not have a majority but had managed to buy the necessary number of horses. Now those horses have bolted the stable. But given the states political culture, they may agree to return if offered a better feed.

 The man who is being touted as the next chief minister is Madhu Koda, former Bharatiya Janata Party activist, and currently an independent legislator from Jagannathpur in West Singbhum district. A recent press report mentioned that he was friends with a few industrialists of that area. Close ties between politicians and businessmen are nothing new but it comes as a jolt when a tribal is seen playing a role so common to dikhu (outsider) politicians. Or are todays tribal leaders seeking to pay back the moneybags for the businessmens support? That support, of course, had not always been voluntary. Incidentally, why does Koda fly out to Bangkok so often as he has been reported to be doing?

 If the ordinary tribal had any hopes from a state of his own, he must have realized by now that it was all a pipe dream. Virtually nothing has come his way. It may be pointed out that this is the order of the day throughout the country. But then tribals have always suffered much more than others and, in their innocence, they have clung on to a dream which others would have given up long ago. That dream must now have been shattered. This is not a comforting thought for a state battling Maoists. What is particularly strange about the situation in Jharkhand is that it has never been ruled by the Congress, a party which mastered the art of manipulative politics long ago. Jharkhand has seen governments formed by the BJP and its allies, political outfits that claim that they regard principles above everything else. 

 But where are their principles? When Arjun Munda saw that four ministers elected as independents had crossed over, he should have advised the party that he be given permission to resign. But no, he told the central leaders that he would be able to win back support and they encouraged him to do so. So what happened to the principles that the BJP and the sangh parivar have been gloating about?

 It is also difficult to understand the action of the speaker, Inder Singh Namdhari, of the BJP. He has issued disqualification notices to the three members who have defected from the Arjun Munda government on the basis of defection charges that are at least a year old. The speaker had ignored the charges for so long and he has now brought them out for the purpose of saving Munda. A seasoned politician like Namdhari cannot be unaware that the man who occupies the chair is not guided by partisan politics. But why blame Namdhari alone? The occupant of Ranchis Raj Bhavan had also not covered himself with glory last year when he was seen as acting in a partisan manner. In the case of governors, the time has come to take a close look at the wisdom of having politicians in this office, as they have misused this position far too often. In neighbouring Bihar, Buta Singh had not been exactly impartial while dismissing the first Nitish Kumar ministry. Some years ago, in Lucknow, a governor had also acted in a manner that had forced Atal Bihari Vajpayee to stage a dharna outside the Rashtrapati Bhavan. 

 One of the arguments offered when a small state is created is that it is being done to ensure better administration. This argument was heard during Jharkhands inception and the question that may legitimately be asked now is what administration are we talking about? There is a lot of money floating in the air in Ranchi but how has that helped the countryside? Is the Jharkhand villager in any way better off than when the capital was in Patna? Actually the degree of economic depravation and the political culture remain unchanged. Indeed it is the experience with Jharkhand, more than any other small state, that should make New Delhi think twice before giving in to pressures from groups wanting their own playfield. One hopes that a day will not come when any serious thought is given to demands that Jharkhand should also include tribal belts in West Bengal like Purulia and Jhargram.

 Returning to the issue of Jharkhands immediate future. If the present Central dispensation has any sense, it should immediately intervene and impose presidents rule. The Congress, along with the Rashtriya Janata Dal and Shibu Soren, is busy ensuring that the National Democratic Alliance gets a drubbing. At the same time, they are keeping a close eye on their flock lest the long arm of Munda catches up with them. This is a repetition of the ugly scene that we have seen so far and the prime minister should not hesitate to put Jharkhand under presidents rule. Not that presidents rule would clear the decks permanently. But a fresh election will at least give people a chance to deliver a definite mandate rather than a fractured one. It is also time for the Election Commission to introduce rules that will make it difficult for independents to contest. Their presence on the scene is a sure invitation to the politics of aya ram, gaya ram.

 Sleeping in his grave, Jaipal Singh must be smiling. The prime mover of the Jharkhand movement had switched over to the Congress. He knew that despite the talks of identity, it would be the mainstream culture that was sure to prevail.

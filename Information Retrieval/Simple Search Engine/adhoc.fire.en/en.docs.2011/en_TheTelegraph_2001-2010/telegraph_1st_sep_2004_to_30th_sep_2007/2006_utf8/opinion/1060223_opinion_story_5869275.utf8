 Learning it the hard way

 Sir ? In retrospect, one finds that the issue of granting autonomy to colleges in West Bengal first began with Presidency College. It had always been the automatic choice so far as the University Grants Commission is concerned and the college too had been demanding it for a long time. However, despite the National Assessment and Accreditation Council having visited Presidency College, it is St Xavier?s College, Calcutta, which has achieved the status of being the first autonomous college in the state. This has led to some unwarranted comparison between these two eminent educational institutions and inane conjectures about Presidency?s shortcomings. Infamous as it already is for its over-hyped college politics, Presidency can certainly do without the negative publicity at this crucial stage of the autonomy procedure. If one has to attest to the college?s worth, it can be pointed out that Presidency has been ranked the second-best college in India after St Stephens, New Delhi, and it consistently produces toppers every year. 

 The only probable reason why St Xavier?s tripped Presidency in the autonomy race is the fact that the former is a private college and, therefore, subject to less extraneous influence. Presidency, being a government-run institution, is more vulnerable to pressures from the state higher education ministry that has throughout been reluctant to let go of the college. However, given that the college has put in a lot of effort for its betterment and the NAAC team is happy with its efforts, it can be said that Presidency?s autonomy is just around the corner. A college has to be judged by the consistency of its performance over the years. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The state government?s refusal to grant autonomy to Presidency College proves that the fate of education in the state is completely, and quite unfortunately, intertwined with politics (?Presidency freedom prey to polls?, Feb 14) . The chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, is indeed left with very few option since he is caught in the vicious trap of his own party?s policy of politicizing the education system. No wonder then that the brightest minds are migrating elsewhere.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Being a student myself, I think that the chief minister is right in fighting for the autonomy of Presidency College. But the minister for higher education, Satyasadhan Chakraborty, is playing spoilsport since he does not want to antagonize the teachers? lobby dominated by the Communist Party of India (Marxist). It is time the government realizes that like the industrial scenario in Bengal, education too needs to be refurbished.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The state government?s reluctance to grant Presidency autonomous status is symptomatic of the administrative corruption that always delays or aborts any project, however well-intentioned. The deplorable state of most of the colleges under Calcutta University is due to the excessive political intervention. The government-meddling has resulted in an outdated syllabi and an examination process which is oblivious to students? interests. Students often get unjustly marked and their career gets jeopardized by delayed results. In such a situation, the better colleges under Calcutta University are fully justified in demanding autonomy. The fact that Alimuddin Street is still debating over the issue shows how unconcerned it is about improving the educational set-up. It is shameful that an institution is being denied what it deserves simply because some ministers are unwilling to relinquish their partisan interests. The chief minister?s promise that he will personally look into the matter gives us hope. He will be rendering invaluable service to his alma mater if Presidency gets the autonomous status.

 Yours faithfully,

 Parting shot

 Sir ? In the recent spat between Ravi Shankar and Zakir Hussain, everyone seems to have forgotten the needs of the audience (?Tabla on top?, Feb 19). The sound engineer plays an important part in any musical programme since his job is to continuously monitor and balance the sound levels of all the microphones in front of different instruments to produce a pleasing harmony. The volume of the tabla should never be set at the same level as that of santoor, sitar or sarod, as the louder percussion will drown the softer sounds of the stringed instruments. On the other hand, the tabla should not be set so low that its rhythm cannot be heard clearly. This is a technical specification that has got nothing to do with the status or reputation of the artistes. The recent row seems to have its origin in the public perception that the louder things are, the better. 

 I had the privilege of attending this year?s Dover Lane music conference, where the blaring loudspeakers killed the music of many skilled performers. Several (Ali Akbar Khan more than once) complained that the resultant echo in the restricted space caused them difficulty in following their own recital. Eventually, I found that the only way to enjoy the music was to stick my fingers into my ears which helped to tone the racket down to a tolerable level. Let all of us make the same gesture to this childish quarrel amongst ace artistes. 

 Yours faithfully,

L.N. Roy Choudhury, Calcutta

 THE NEW INDIAN TRUTH

 Malvika Singh

 The year 2006 is moving on roller-skates as we enter the second half of February with a sense of disarray across the political spectrum. As our airports wallow in inexplicable ineptitude run by lazy, incompetent people on government dole, for all practical purposes, the left in India are yelling their guts out to protect bad management and zero service. It makes one shudder to see how senseless the protest is. Instead of concentrating on demanding a cleansing of the corrupt system of governance, on forcing the need for infrastructure, power and water to be put in place, on fighting for basic education and healthcare, on ensuring that law and order prevails in the villages, towns and cities and that the authorities work for the people and not against their immediate interests, and most important, on pushing for colonial laws to be re-addressed and changed to assist a democratic polity, they are fiddling about carelessly asking for superficial and redundant action, action that belongs to a regressive, old and staid mind set.

 Their rhetoric of today seems to be aimed at their constituents in West Bengal. As an outsider, it appears that the CPI(M) is also split along the middle like all parties in India. The CM of Bengal is a man most people in India respect but, in equal measure, they are aghast at the shrill cries that emanate from some members of the politburo. The double-speak we hear which is beginning to sound like that of the BJP/RSS sends shivers down the spine. This trait of fooling and confusing constituents as well as voters with contradictory statements about positions, beliefs and values, is predictable. All polarized parties indulge in such articulation as they deal and cope with their lapsed thinking on issues that have changed radically with time and with a younger, more agile mind of another generation living in a global reality. Where are the forty year old leaders of the CPI(M)? Why are they not brought forward? Why do we not see their faces, hear their voices? Are they a part of the new Indian truth? Do they meet and talk to their counterparts in other parties, something that is essential for a healthy democracy? Or do they not believe at all in democracy, much like Stalin?

 Unspoken blackmail

 The airport saga that unfolded over last week was juvenile to say the least. We all know well that those who work for the government do not ?work?, they wander about with an officious and arrogant gait, pretending they are doing what they have been employed to do. They live off those who generate wealth in this nation, those who pay their taxes. These pot-bellied and well-fed ?staff?, government employees, have reduced the face of India to something the real India is not. Why is this ridiculous brief being held for non-performance? Why doesn?t Prakash Karat, for example, go on hunger-strike till farmers committing suicide are taken care of? Why does he not go on a hunger strike till certain colonial laws that have corrupted the Indian polity are reformed? Why is the demand always superficial? Indians have had more than their share of pampered government employees who have held the country to ransom as they exploit us all and our patience. No one is accountable for their ineptitude, their corruption, their mismanagement. 

 Blackmail, holding institutions to ransom by forcing closure and other such exploitative tactics belong to protest instruments of the past. Today, dialogue, discourse, give-andtake need to be compelled. We seem to have petrified like fossils in a vibrant environment that is looking to the future. There is lots going wrong but ongoing threats, verging on unspoken blackmail, are no answer to the immense problems we have to address. If the government has to fall because of a lack of outside support, so be it. Let us move on and deal with the realities of today, not be suffocated with the rhetoric of a bygone time.

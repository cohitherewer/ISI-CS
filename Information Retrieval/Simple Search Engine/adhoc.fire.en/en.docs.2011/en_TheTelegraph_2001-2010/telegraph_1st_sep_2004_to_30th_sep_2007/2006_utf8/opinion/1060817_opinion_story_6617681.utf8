 ART OF SPEECH

 There is no denying that making a speech every year on the occasion of Independence Day is a tedious task. The nation expects the prime minister on that day to say something stirring, to say something sensible and to say something worthy of some reflection. It is difficult to meet all these expectations. The problem is compounded when the prime minister of the day is not a natural orator who can carry the people, their emotions and their thoughts, in the course of the speech. Jawaharlal Nehru had this enviable ability and his ineffable charisma helped. One of his principal admirers, Mr Manmohan Singh, the present prime minister, unfortunately is not an orator. He is a man of depth but not one who can move people with the power of words. His speeches are seldom memorable and never stirring. His address to the nation on Independence Day was no exception. In fact, it was breathtakingly ordinary but no one expected it to be otherwise.

 But Mr Singhs lack of oratorical skills cannot quite explain some other aspects of his address. Clichs seemed to trip one over the other in the text of the speech. We salute our beloved tricolour, India is certainly on the march, we have miles to go and so on. Surely there are enough wordsmiths in the prime ministers office who can express these sentiments without repeating phrases which have all lost their meaning. Nobody expected the prime minister to make bold policy pronouncements in his Independence Day speech. But neither was it expected that he would utter pious platitudes through fatigued phrases. What made it worse was an element of dissembling in the speech. It is clear that the government is trying to curtail the extent of the Right to Information Act. Yet the prime minister expressed the hope that the act would empower the people. Only in one sense was the speech completely honest albeit unconsciously. The speech was lacklustre and thus reflected completely the image and the performance of the government. India is on the march but its steps are not synchronized.

 Letters to Editor

 Disturbing images

 Sir ? As images of police brutality on students protesting against reservations came in from Delhi and Mumbai, one could not help but wonder if the government was bent on scripting a sequel to the Mandal agitation of the Nineties (?Quota chain reaction sets in?, May, 14). One was shell-shocked to see students being mercilessly beaten, tear-gassed and drenched with water cannons. Students making a legitimate protest did not deserve to be treated like criminals. Their assembling in high security zones did not mean that they were trying to break into some politician?s residence or office. If students from the backward classes were to protest in support of reservations, would they be roughed up as well? 

 The government, in reality, is committed to neither group. However, it should realize that unless it acts soon, the agitation may lead to street fights and violence. And India, at this stage, can do without new pretexts for violence.

 Yours faithfully,

Somak Datta, Kalyani

 Sir ? The National Human Rights Commission should take note of the video clippings that show how the Mumbai Police have allegedly taken the help of anti-social elements to beat up agitating medical students. The Mumbai police commissioner, A.N. Ray, and other responsible police personnel should not only be suspended but taken to book for this violation of human rights. Ray was also distorting the truth when he denied that his force had lathi-charged the group. 

 It is useless to wait for seven long days for the inquiry ordered by the commissioner on the orders of the Maharashtra governor, especially when there is conclusive evidence on camera. A country where the police have to take the help of criminals to discipline the educated youth cannot have a bright future. The governor, the chief minister, and the deputy chief minister of Maharashtra must apologize to the students.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhash C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? The televised images of medicos being brutalized do not make for a happy weekend for the viewer. The action of the Mumbai police was barbaric to say the least. If such atrocities, whether against students or striking workers, is permitted in India, we should re-examine our commitment to democracy. The inference to be drawn from incidents like the ones in Mumbai and at the Honda factory in Gurgaon last year is that the establishment will not tolerate dissent. The powers-that-be have absolute authority to dictate terms, whether pertaining to economic liberalization or to ?economic suicide?, as in the present case. And why has a Mumbai police inspector been suspended when the city police chief had already justified the police action? If there is anyone who deserves suspension, it is the police commissioner himself. 

 Yours faithfully,

Deepak Rao, Calcutta

 Sir ? India should relinquish its claim of being the second largest democracy since in no democracy are peaceful protesters beaten up as the agitators were in Mumbai. Protesting against government decisions is a fundamental democratic right. The police rhetoric notwithstanding, the students had not broken the law. The Centre has been barking up the wrong tree for a long time with reservations, but the handling of the protests in Delhi and Mumbai begs immediate public activism.

 Yours faithfully,

Amit Kr. Mishra, Baghmara, Meghalaya

 Sir ? While the police dare not lay their hands on a procession or a rally organized by a political party in a city even though it brings public life to a stand-still, it is only with the students (who, in this case, have no political backing) that they decide to show their muscle power. Another matter which appears equally shocking is the silence of the political parties. Instead of condemning the police high-handedness, they seem to be tacitly backing the police action. 

 Yours faithfully,

Abhishek Law, Calcutta

 Sir ? There can be little dispute that the proposed increase of backward caste quotas in medical colleges is an ill-conceived and ill-executed idea. But the threat of a bandh by the medicos is equally foolhardy (?Doctors? quota bandh?, May 13). Sanjib Malik, president of the Indian Medical Association, has indicated that doctors need to go on a strike to build up pressure on the government. But this ?pressure? by the IMA is likely to cause needless pain to many patients while failing to impress opportunist politicians. Besides, the principles of their profession demand that medical practitioners set aside their personal concerns, no matter how justified, whenever there is a patient to attend to. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kunal Saha, Columbus, US

 On guard

 Sir ? The Telegraph should be thanked for publishing the details of the philanthropic endeavour of Goutam Das (?Police aid for burnt man?, May 14). It is exhilarating to know that Calcutta?s spirit is recovering. Incidents of the police helping out people on the streets will go a long way in bolstering public confidence. It would be humiliating to judge the performance of these policemen on the basis of the accolades and prize they get from their respective departments. Let us remember that like Das, there are also taxi drivers and footpath dwellers who have come forward to help people. 

 Yours faithfully,

Pinaki Roy, Balurghat

 Sir ? It is an indication of the times that we live in that policemen make headlines when they do their duty. There is no doubt that Goutam Das has been brave in taking an electrocuted man to the hospital. But he was ?doing his job?, and so were two other traffic policemen in the city who took an ailing man to the hospital last week. It could be that the police, the portfolio being handled by the chief minister himself, is making a concerted effort to change its image. But it will take more than one Das to really make the impact felt.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Biswas, Calcutta

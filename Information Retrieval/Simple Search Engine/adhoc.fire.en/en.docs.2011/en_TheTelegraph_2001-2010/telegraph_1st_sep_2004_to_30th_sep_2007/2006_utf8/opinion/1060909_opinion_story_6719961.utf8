The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 CURIOUS CURRENT

 The old quip about Calcutta catching a cold when Paris sneezes may be something of an exaggeration, but scientists are demonstrating that movements in the waters of the Pacific Ocean can have an effect on the monsoon in India. The votaries of the new technology that has made the world a smaller place must pause to ponder the phenomenon called El Nio in the eastern tropical Pacific which causes major climate changes in regions as far removed from it as south Asia. The name El Nio or the baby Christ was given by South American fishermen because they noticed that it occurred during Christmas. The first official mention of it can be dated back to 1892 when it was discussed in the Geographical Society Congress. Since then, it has continued to confound scientists because its occurrence and its impact remain unpredictable. Nobody has been able to quite explain why every few years, around the winter solstice, a current of unusually warm water appears around the coast of Peru and Ecuador. This current of warm water has always been known to affect climate in the Americas. It has also been shown that El Nio leads to lower biological productivity in the ocean. El Nio thus has an impact on the entire ecosystem.

 For a large part of the 20th century, El Nio and its impact were thought of as a local phenomenon. But this changed dramatically with the appearance of El Nio in 1982-83. This was considered a major El Nio event by the scientific community which began to track its appearance and impact. Research suggested links between El Nio and the phenomenon of global warming. But these remain at the level of hypothesis. A new aspect of the El Nio effect has been opened by the findings of scientists on how the warm waters of the current influence weather conditions in India.

 Indias rainfall history goes back 132 years, and it has been observed that severe shortage of rain in other words drought conditions has coincided with El Nio events. But El Nio events have not always produced droughts. This unpredictability has baffled scientists. Now it seems that a solution has been found to the mystery. Droughts are explained not by the appearance of El Nio but by its precise location. The warming can occur anywhere in the eastern Pacific off the coast of Peru or thousands of miles away in the central Pacific. When the warming occurs in the central Pacific, rainfall in India is adversely affected resulting in severe drought. The monsoon in India is thus a function of the location of the baby Christ.

 El Nio is not exactly a blessing for people affected by it. But for scientists it has opened up a new area of research. The study that demonstrates a correlation between the location of El Nio in the central Pacific Ocean and droughts in India is based on 23 El Nio years. The whimsical child may be laughing somewhere.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 UNEASY LIES THE HEAD... 

 - There was hope when he came. Now we think its hopeless

 These are testing times for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The government faces flak, the Left is angry with Singh and the BJP sneers at him, describing him as a man who is on deputation but not in charge, reports Bishakha De Sarkar

Football is in the air, so the allegories in Congress 

circles are rather sporty these days. Out in the field, says a senior Congressman, 

is the two-year-old United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. The skipper 

in the centre is the man with the blue turban. The problem, though, is that there 

are no cheerleaders and fanfare to announce the team. And some believe that there 

has been no huddle either ? none of the quick brainstorming that precedes a stroke. 

 The imagery is to do with football, but the issue being discussed is reservation. Higher quotas for Other Backward Classes (OBCs) in private educational institutions may now be on the back burner, but the issue is still dangerously simmering away. And for the UPA government, its just one of the many subjects troubling its constituents. 

 For the Congress, it has been a fairly long month. First came the protracted stir on reservation, which saw agitated doctors and other professionals out in the street. Then came the Presidents decision to return the office of profit bill to Parliament with a few queries. And now the issue of petroleum and diesel price increase is being hotly debated ? within and outside the government. The Left parties have called for a day of protest on June 13. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is already in protest mode and is holding roadside dharnas. And even within the Congress, there is a section that is putting pressure on the government to bring down the raised prices. 

 Clearly, this is not an easy time for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. And not surprisingly, the Prime Minister is playing a game of hide-and-seek ? now you see him, now you dont ? with the country. And when he is not doing that, he is indulging in a tight-rope act ? now he is stern, now he is acquiescent. But while the Prime Minister may be trying to keep all factions happy, many believe that the time has come for him to stand up and be counted. Though, of course, I think its rather clever of him to keep quiet, says a Cabinet colleague. 

 There are good reasons for him to maintain a low profile. He is hamstrung because he has not inherited the government ? because it has been given to him, says a critic from the Left. He is just the CEO of a government which has no disha (direction) but is in a dasha (abysmal state), says Sushma Swaraj of the BJP. 

 There are some who believe that the Prime Minister, in his bid to please everybody, has ended up pleasing nobody at all. The Left is angry with him and the BJP, the main Opposition party, sneers at him, describing him as a man who is on deputation, but not in charge. How can he function when hes not sure of himself, asks Swaraj. 

 The reformists feel that he is not going fast enough, succumbing at every step to Left interventions. And within the Congress, too, there is a growing feeling of discontent. There was hope when he came, says a party worker, attached to a senior leader. But now we think its hopeless. 

 Not everybody is surprised. This is bound to happen because, for the first time, the Prime Ministers post is not the central political authority, says a minister at the Centre from Maharashtra. And because of that, ministers bypass the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) with ease, he says. The buzz has it that some of the senior ministers ? many of whom held important portfolios when Singh was a bureaucrat ? go straight to Congress president Sonia Gandhi to debate troublesome government issues. Senior leaders like Arjun Singh and Pranab Mukherjee have a direct line to the Congress president ? one that was also greatly used by K. Natwar Singh when he was the foreign minister, much to the consternation of the Prime Minister. 

 And even some of the allies ? like Ramvilas Paswan or Dayanidhi Maran ? would rather discuss matters with Sonia Gandhi than with Singh. And the problem is that Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh have a friendly relationship, but its not a free and frank one, says an observer. So any complaint that Manmohan Singh may want to make will become a big issue if he ever raises it. 

 Some Congress watchers believe that since both Singh and Sonia Gandhi are people of few words, serious issues are left untouched. And one of the problems is that the political secretary to the Congress president, Ahmed Patel, himself a reticent man, does not hold regular meetings with the Prime Minister to discuss matters of concern. 

 The reservation issue is a case in point. Cabinet members stress that the issue was hardly discussed ? between Manmohan Singh and human resource development minister minister Arjun Singh, or in the Cabinet. Once the Parliament had passed a Constitutional amendment making it mandatory for the government to have quotas for OBCs, the government had to legislate it. The Prime Minister, sources said, wanted more time ? but Arjun Singh then threw the Constitutional amendment at him, and there was nothing that he could do about it.

 But what worried both the pro-reservation and anti-reservation camps was the fact that neither was sure of the Prime Ministers own views on the subject. In some quarters it is believed that the anti-reservationists went on strike because they thought the Prime Minister would come to their aid. In fact, even an old friend of his ? former Knowledge Commission member and sociologist Andre Beteille ? is believed to have said that he felt let down by the governments position on reservation. But in informal meetings with members of the Knowledge Commission, the Prime Minister had spoken out in favour of reservation, pointing out that no lower caste had made it to the top positions in the upper caste-dominated bureaucracy. 

 At the same time, a colleague points out that the Prime Minister had also hoped to go slow on reservation. He wanted to build up the infrastructure first ? for education and employment ? before announcing reservation, says the colleague. But the Prime Minister succumbed to pressures ? not just because of Arjun Singh, who was spearheading the move for quotas, but because of allies such as the PMK of Tamil Nadu, advocating reservation for OBCs. 

 Manmohan Singh, his associates hold, is a mild mannered man, not given to histrionics. A proponent of the middle path ? one of the first things he said after becoming Prime Minister was that he would follow neither the Left, nor the Right, on the subject of text books ? he is, however, often seen by members of the Congress and the Left as someone who doesnt take a position. It is said that the Prime Minister cant sneeze without taking permission from Sonia Gandhi, says Swaraj. 

 To some, however, Singhs trait of equidistance is worth cultivating. There may be people wholl believe that he has ended up not pleasing anybody. Id say that he has not displeased anybody either, says D.P. Tripathi, a spokesperson for one of the UPA partners, the Nationalist Congress Party. He is the new kind of a PM ? a professional trying to steer the government through economic, social and political crises.

 Within the Congress, however, there is a fair amount of concern because there are many who believe that the government is caught between two worlds. Those hankering for reform believe that not enough of that is happening. Those pushing for advances in the social sector hold that there is little movement on that front, either. But the restraining hand of the National Advisory Council, led by the Congress president, is doing a useful job, says a minister, hinting that Singh would have, otherwise, carried out the governments programme of economic reform. 

 However, some, like former minister Salman Khursheed believe that the government is moving ahead ? but little is known about the progress it has made. There are several pillars of rural uplift, and the arches on top are being expanded with more and more representation, Khursheed holds. Sometime in the next few months ? possibly as a mid-term appraisal ? the government plans to showcase its achievements with a media blitzkrieg. Its time for Dr Manmohan Singh to become a storyteller, says Khursheed. Some of the best statesmen of our times ? from Ho Chi Minh to Nelson Mandela ? were also great storytellers, he says. 

 The government does have a list of achievements, something that even critics within the Congress and outside, such as the Communist Party of India (CPI), admit. The rural employment guarantee scheme ? even if it was watered down from the original draft that sought to give guaranteed employment in every rural district ? has won its share of accolades. Though it has evoked serious criticism, too, some within the government believe that the recent Indo-US nuclear deal is a landmark move. CPI national secretary D. Raja points out that the government repealed POTA, as it had promised to do. There are some other good steps, such as the passing of the domestic violence bill and the right to Information Act, that the government has initiated, he says. 

 Still, the list of things not done is a long one, too ? and Manmohan Singh is getting the flak for it. A member of the PMO points out that Singh himself is keen to see labour and judicial reforms come into practice, as well as greater privatisation and growth of private educational institutions. The Left allies, on the other hand, are pressing for relief for agriculture workers and the unorganised sector, along with the passing of two controversial bills ? for the rights of tribal people to forest land, and for quotas for women in elected bodies. There is a lot to be done, says Raja. 

 With discontentment levels growing, the Left is planning to release a comprehensive document, possibly before the end of the month, to focus on its differences with the UPA government. We have conveyed our dissatisfaction on many issues on many occasions, and we are now going to put it all down in writing, says Prakash Karat, the general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Except in Parliament, when the UPA needs our help and discusses matters, on other issues it just pushes its way through, says Karat. 

 The stand-off between Manmohan Singh and the Left seems to be hardening. Earlier this week, Karat led the Left in refusing to attend a meeting convened by the Prime Minister just before the government decided to go ahead and announce a rise in petrol prices ? a move that the Left had long been opposing. Singhs office retaliated by hinting that the Prime Minister would not visit Calcutta, as he had been slated to next week, to lay the foundation stone for a science institute. 

 The reservation stir has been temporarily put to rest, but the coming days are going to be stormy for the Prime Minister. Swaraj of the BJP says that her party will take up the issues of price hike and the office of profit bill in the monsoon session of Parliament, slated to be convened in the last week of July. The Left will tighten the screws on the Manmohan Singh government and his own colleagues promise to give him a hard time. The economic growth of 8.3 per cent has to trickle down to the people, says a minister. After all, people cant eat the national income, he says. 

 The Prime Minister, more than anybody else, will be waiting for the referee to blow his long whistle ? indicating the end of game.

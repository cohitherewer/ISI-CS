 Power in Print: Popular publishing 

 and the politics of language and culture in a colonial society 

 By Anindita Ghosh, Oxford, Rs 650

 As people create language, so the language of a particular community constitutes its identity. The imperialist agenda consists in depriving the colonized people of a language of their own. The colonizing process is complete when the colonized discover that their native language has been stifled. To make themselves heard, to write their own history, they have no other language but that of the colonizers.

 Since the locus of British power in India was Bengal, the Bengali language became the site of struggle between the colonizer and the colonized in the 18th and 19th centuries. The British had to master Bengali for administrative purposes and more crucially, to gain access to the native mind and so to control it. Hence they started off a process of standardization. This meant that the British imposed their discretion to purify the native dialect and make it acceptable according to their own standards. Anindita Ghoshs Power in Print argues that this standardizing process was neither uncontested, nor unmediated. The book attempts to explore the active participation of indigenous social groups in the formation of the standardizing norms. 

 The vital factor helping the native speakers in this regard is that Bengal was the home of the first established vernacular press in India. The cheap printing techniques, combined with a basic level of literacy, allowed the suppressed groups to retain their voice even in the face of a strong civilizing current. While the educated Bengali middle class adopted the language and ethos of the colonizing power to gain acceptability in society, authors, publishers and readers from relatively lower rungs of society resisted the standardizing process by stubbornly sticking to the eccentricities of the native speech and giving them expression in print. These voices from the margins continued to challenge the norms of the acceptable in literature. 

 The hub of the commercial publishing industry in Bengal was Battala in north Calcutta. The cheap books and tracts that were churned out in dozens from the Battala presses articulated tastes and values that were significantly different from the literary standards being created by the British. They defied the new-fangled norms by this very difference. The barely literate and even the illiterate could get easy access to mythological tales and ballads, popular romances, almanacs, thrillers, farcical skits, dramas and the like by doling out a few annas from their pockets. These popular books enjoyed a symbiotic relationship with their readers. Being produced mostly by people of plebian origin, the ideology of these writings mirrored that of the writers and of the readers for whom they were produced. At the same time, the cultural sensibilities that they inculcated in their readers were radically different from those being disseminated by the ruling class.

 Ghosh demonstrates how the social farces that rose to popularity in the 1870s served as critiques of contemporary mores by irreverently laughing at the puritanical presumptions of the bhadralok class. Like the city-comedies of 17th-century England, these plays had servants, prostitutes and humble rustic folks as their main protagonists. While extolling the moral virtues of poverty, the farces attacked the hypocrisy and debauchery of upper-class people. Literature of this kind was empowering for the poor, as it provided them with a medium to voice their dissent against the dominant culture, which sought to silence them.

 Challenges to the standardizing trend in Bengali were posed by two other significant groups those of marginalized women and impoverished Muslims, with their repertory of tales in syncretistic folk Bengali. What is remarkable about the writings of both these sections of society is the fact that they retained and celebrated traces of the original Bengali. In order to define itself, the Sanskritized Bengali of the educated male Hindu has had the language of these groups stigmatized as vulgar and improper. But rich in self-representation, these writings strongly resisted the process of linguistic purification and ultimately left their mark on what came to be characterized as modern Bengali.

 The renaissance in Bengali language and literature was largely a product of the enlightened middle class. The exposure of this class to European ideas helped it to identify and reject certain aspects of the indigenous culture that were in need of modification. Yet the reforming zeal in language and literature was always in the danger of suppressing the vital elements of the native culture and speech habits. But, as Power in Print demonstrates, these peripheral voices proved too strong to be ignored. They thrived in the cheap but widely popular printed literature of the 19th century and continued to throw out challenges to the high literature by their wide circulation. By highlighting these local struggles, Ghosh has offered a fresh insight into the birth and growth of the modern Bengali language.

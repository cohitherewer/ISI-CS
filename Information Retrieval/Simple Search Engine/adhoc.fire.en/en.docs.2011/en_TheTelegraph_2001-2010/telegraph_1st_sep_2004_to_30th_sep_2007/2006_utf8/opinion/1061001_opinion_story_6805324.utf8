The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Puja in the times of the Net

 - I can access almost all kinds of puja paraphernalia on the website

 From Toronto to Timbuktu, you can soak in the festive spirit thanks to dozens of websites that showcase different aspects of Durga Puja, reports Anirban Das Mahapatra

 Net, set, go: Today, 

 thanks to the Internet, the stage for the pujas is truly 

 global 

 Ensconced in the comforts of her cushy home at Hendon in London, Saraswati Pandit sits in front of the computer, scrolling enthusiastically through the website of a Calcutta-based puja portal for images of goddess Durga. I am deeply religious, and my domiciled status in the United Kingdom has done nothing to dent my faith in God, says the 62-year-old non-resident Indian, a cashier at a John Lewis departmental store. 

 Its a typical September day in the English capital and nothing has perceptibly changed outside the walls of her residence, where life still goes on with unfailing British punctuality. Inside, however, time has gone into a warp for the expatriate, who knows exactly what it feels like to wake up to golden sunshine on an autumn morning and hear the wind blow through rustling kash phool or foxtails. And though the dhaks havent started beating in sync outside her window, as they used to back home long ago, Pandit is not complaining. Thanks to the Internet, the pujas, for Pandit, are now only a click away. 

 Several time zones away, Sapna Banerjee, a 25-year-old second generation New Yorker, uses the Internet to soak in an experience that was never quite her own. I have heard that people in Calcutta go from neighbourhood to neighbourhood checking out the different manifestations of Ma Durga and the elaborate decorations, says Banerjee. She cant always do that in New York but Banerjee has found an alternative. All chapters that organise pujas around here are very Net savvy, and even if I cant take a physical tour around town, I can browse through them all virtually and feel the festive spirit. 

 BONG WITH 

 A BANG

 A simple Durga Puja search on Google 

 is likely to take surfers to the website of Timir 

 K. Ganguly, a resident of Stuttgart, Germany, 

 who has taken the pains of putting up a personal 

 website dedicated to the pujas. 

 There may be no frills attached to www.ganguly.de/durgapuja/durgapuja.html 

 , but the effort clearly reflects the sentiments 

 of a section of the diaspora who have never known 

 their homeland first hand but nevertheless share 

 a bonding with Bengal. 

 Gangulys parents last saw a puja in Calcutta 

 in 1978. I personally have seen only one 

 Durga Puja in Calcutta, in 1997, he says. 

 However, it was in 1996 that he was prompted by 

 a friend to start his website. In place for nearly 

 a decade now, the site currently puts together 

 a series of links that lead to Mahalaya audiostreams, 

 songs by Hemanta Mukhopadhyay and Manna Dey, a 

 facility to search for air tickets to Calcutta 

 in case anyone is feeling homesick, a detailed 

 itinerary of the pujas this year and even a Flash 

 animation where one can offer a virtual anjali 

 simply by clicking on items. 

 In 1995, Gangulys father took the initiative 

 of setting up a puja in Stuttgart for the benefit 

 of the few permanently-settled Bengali families 

 in the vicinity. A friend donated the Durga 

 pratima from Kumartuli, so I went to Kumartuli 

 with my father and organised its transport to 

 Stuttgart, he says. Information about the 

 Stuttgart puja is also available on the site, 

 including road directions to the puja mandap and 

 snapshots from past pujas. Bengalis from all over 

 south Germany apparently trickle in to partake 

 in the festivities and the purohit one 

 Mr Ray is brought in from London. 

 The feedback to my website is very positive, 

 says Ganguly. I get mails from all over 

 the world. Many people enjoy the online Mahalaya 

 this year, there were more than 3,000 hits 

 on the day of Mahalaya, he adds.

 Clearly, the altar of worship seems to have no 

 geographical boundaries.

Clearly, the days when probashi or expatriate Bengalis sitting in an apartment in downtown Los Angeles or Hamburg would mourn the distance between them and their old neighbourhood puja are history. From Toronto to Timbuktu, the jazz of the pujas is now for the taking, albeit on cyberspace. 

 Dozens of websites some run by entrepreneurs in India, some by Bengalis living abroad have come up in recent times showcasing different aspects of Durga Puja. With the puja bouquet on the Internet, you can listen to agomoni songs that celebrate the arrival of Durga, check out puja dates and schedules, get a close-up of some of the best images in and outside Calcutta or even surprise relatives living thousands of kilometres away with a box of sweets on bijoya dashami. 

 Sambit Kundu, a software professional working in San Diego in California, says that he enjoys listening to the musical pre-puja odes of the Mahalaya. All Kundu has to do is log on to his favourite website, www.bangalinet.com and wait for the audiostream to load on his computer. It is an evocative experience, he gushes. 

 Then theres Saroj Majumdar, an entrepreneur resident in Liverpool, who finds www.anandautsav.com just right for savouring the sights of the pujas back home. It used to be difficult to get a feel of the pujas earlier, but now I can actually access almost all kinds of puja paraphernalia on the website, he says. There are shots of specific pujas in particular areas in Calcutta and they remind me of my childhood days. 

 Needless to say, puja crazy non-resident Bengalis are having the time of their lives for technology has ensured that the festival is no longer a fading album of old snap shops. Technology helps them get a much clearer picture of what is going on back home, says Delhi-based social scientist Ashis Nandy. It reduces the chances of them wallowing in a false sense of community feeling that is likely to arise out of their not knowing exactly what the dominant mood in Bengal is like, he observes. 

 There was a time when the pujas came all wrapped in nostalgia for the Bengali living outside the state. But advancing technology has succeeded in taking the pujas to a wider circle of audience. If television programmes on Doordarshan enabled Bengalis living across West Bengal to catch up with the puajs across the state in the early 90s, satellite TV made it possible for a national audience to tune in a few years later. Now, with the Internet, the stage for the pujas is truly global. 

 The trend of online puja began some five years ago but has become more and more fancy in recent times, thanks, primarily, to the spread of digital cameras. With the Internet boom, web developers realised the puja experience could be carried to each and every home over the Net, says Sushmita Roy of the Delhi-based Compare Infobase Ltd, the developers of www.123Durgapuja.com. 

 Not surprisingly, websites catering to the expatriates interests have proliferated. Most sites are easy to run since they either depend on greetings and gifts or contain stock information such as the history of pujas and puja schedules. 

 Some, like Anandautsav launched in 2003 are substantially more detailed. A one-stop URL, it has news about the pujas (will it rain in Calcutta?), puja clippings, legends of Durga and lip-smacking puja recipes. There are downloads and even short animation films that take on everything from Mahisasura thus giving the devil his due to the Bengalis knack of leaving home for Darjeeling during the holidays. That apart, the website has room for pujas from all over the world organising committees from places as diverse as Paris, Hanoi, Toronto, Montreal to London and Baltimore send in photos of their own pujas, making the affair truly international. 

 In its wings are websites that help people send their wishes to friends and relatives. The major demand on our website is for wallpapers of goddess Durga and cards, says Roy. From Mahalaya onwards, we have begun to receive at least 80-100 hits in the cards section and about 50-60 hits in the wallpaper section of our website every day. We expect the daily number of hits to go up to about 300 during the pujas.

 Most hits, say webmasters, come in from the US and the UK but resident Indians have also begun to log in. Thats because there are thousands of Bengalis living in Indian cities other than Calcutta who want to keep a tab on activities, whether in Calcutta or in their own cities, says a developer. 

 Portals such as Bangalinet have incorporated novel features on their site such as audio clips of dhak beats. We have a section on the history of the Durga Puja, says Sukanta Chatterjee, CEO, Bangalinet. For example, the fact that Durga Puja has a history that goes back to the Battle of Plassey is unknown to many. The daily number of hits on Bangalinet is an astounding 2,500, claims Chatterjee. 

 Gifting is yet another activity that puja websites make possible. And those who have used online facilities to send presents in the past know just how much of a difference it can make. The ability to send gifts at the click of a button makes it a lot easier to let people know back home that youre thinking of them during the pujas, says 40-year-old Gautam Chakravartee, a resident of New York. 

 And thats primarily the reason why developers who have e-commerce sections dealing with puja gifts have a couple of weeks of hectic business. We have been getting about 10-12 gift orders on our website every day, says Pranav Sharma of the Lucknow-based website Indiagiftsportal. And the gifts are not only outbound a lot of bookings are made from abroad to be delivered to Bengali homes across India as well. The choice of gifts varies from website to website, ranging from sweets boxes to items of home dcor. But the clear-cut favourite is the kaju barfi hamper, says Dharmendra Jaisinghani, director of the gift portal Indiawithlove. 

 And while the Bengali is happy to furiously click away on the mouse, web developers say they have reason to smile too. For with the growing popularity of puja sites, the revenue has been coming in as well. 

 Prominent websites such as Anandautsav draw high-profile advertisers, including real estate biggies such as Bengal Peerless Housing, electronics goods companies such as Hyundai Electronics and prominent web portals such as Sulekha. For smaller sites, advertisers are dynamically generated by search engines and could be anyone from around the world. 

 Still, there is a flip side to all thats fun about puja on the Net. Nandy warns that it can also foster a sense of parochialism among a few Bengalis living abroad. The virtual link to a common home cloisters them together and makes them more inclined to keep fellow Indians such as Tamils or Gujaratis whom they would have otherwise mingled with at a distance, he says. 

 Right now, though, its Durga Puja that rules. Thousands of finger tips are clicking away frantically in some part of the world or the other. Puja on the Net is just what the doctor ordered: you can see the best of the pujas across the world, offer a prayer, gorge on sweets and send your greetings. And you can always switch it off when the noise gets to you.

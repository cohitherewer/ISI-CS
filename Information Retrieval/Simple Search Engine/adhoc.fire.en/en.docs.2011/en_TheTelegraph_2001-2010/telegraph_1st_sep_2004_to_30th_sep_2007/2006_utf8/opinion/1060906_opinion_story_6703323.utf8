 A LEGEND IN THE SHADOWS

 If acting is the sole criterion, then there are actors other than Suchitra Sen who could get the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, writes Sumanta Sen

 Behind the veil

 For ages now, Suchitra Sen has kept herself confined to her house. At times, there are speculations in the media about her, like when it was reported that she was considering returning to the world of cinema even if only for once. The lady herself had not uttered a word, and the speculations died down. Not, however, public interest in her. Now it is heard that she may be the recipient of the Dadasaheb Phalke Award. The big question, of course, is whether she will agree to receive it and thus expose herself to the public glare? Only Sen herself has the answer to this.

 The news itself is a bit startling. Why Suchitra Sen? Did her name come up because the information minister in New Delhi is a Bengali, who, like many others, grew up on a diet of Uttam-Suchitra starrers? Also, as a politician, he must have thought it would be useful to tickle the sentiments back home. However, two larger questions did not cross anybodys mind: is it alright to disturb somebody who has decided to withdraw herself from public life on her own? Second, what exactly has been her contribution to cinema?

 To answer the first question first. If Suchitra Sen agrees to receive the award, and in person, some critics in the world of cinema would certainly be heard saying, So much for her lack of interest in the outside world. She could not resist the temptation of publicity. This will hurt both Sen and those who admire her for her memorable performances as well her decision to retire gracefully. The fans will be even more hurt if they get to see her now a far cry from the picture of Rina Brown, which they still have of her in their minds. The hurt, of course, would not have been that much if she had been around all this time. Even her most ardent fan would admit that one looks different with age. But by shutting herself up, Sen has stood in the way of this belief. Indeed, it was wise of her to turn down the offers she had received from Mumbai.

 Now the question of her contribution to cinema. She was an actor whose talents certainly did not surpass those of others. Even when she was the rage of Bengali cinema, there were others who were no mean actors. Take Sabitri Chatterjee for instance. Those who had seen her performance as the dumb girl, Shayamali, will agree that Sen could never have played that role. And it was not a one-time performance in a film. Chatterjee had to appear in the role on stage night after night for many months. Even in films, could Suchitra Sen perform as Supriya Chaudhuri did in Meghe Dhaka Tara? As for Kaveri Bose, who knows to what heights she could have risen if her career had not been cut short. A much younger Sharmila Tagore or Aparna Sen also possesed cinematic qualities that Sen obviously lacked.

 Yet people queued up in huge numbers to see her films. The reason, perhaps, was the image she enjoyed from the very beginning. She was not the usual actor from a humble background forced to face the camera because of circumstances. She married into an aristocratic family of south Calcutta, an actor who had not taken to films for money. This was rare in the Fifties and it did matter to some extent. What helped was her awareness that she was different, and she carried herself in a manner to make that perception last. There was always something imperious about her. To most in the film world, she was Mrs Sen, a form of address which suggested that socially she was a notch above the others.

 Then she parted from her husband. Soon, Calcutta was full of stories of how she had been ill-treated. That also helped strengthen her image, especially when she did not choose to be with any other man but lived alone with her daughter. There were rumours but over all she came across as a dignified person who refused to make compromises. She grew in stature and the Uttam-Suchitra team became a sure money spinner. In those days, many insisted that the success was more due to her but it has to be accepted that later, even without her, Uttam Kumar was able to carry the industry forward. This, however, can only be a never-ending argument among old timers and so it is better to accept that one complemented the other.

 Here it must be made clear that no one is suggesting that she was a poor actor. But it is true that the awe with which her name is mentioned today is not just because of her acting abilities. One does wonder whether a great director would have been able to draw out any hidden reserves she may have had, as Satyajit Ray did with Madhabi Mukherjee in Mahanagar and in Charulata. But then, she was approached by the maestro for the lead role in Devi Choudhurani (a film which was never made by Ray) but she refused reportedly because her fees could not be met. Was it just that? Or did Sen decline the offer because she had realized that in a Ray film all the credit went to the director and even a superlative performance would be attributed to his abilities to bring out the best in an actor. Perhaps, Sen could not agree to this. It would have hurt her image, and bruised her ego as well. In fact, Sens refusal also helped her secure the image of an uncompromising lady.

 Her crowning moment came when she decided to call it a day. True, the decision came after her last film had bombed in the box office, but then that was nothing unusual and certainly not a good enough reason to retire. But for Suchitra Sen, her image was more important than anything else. She could not see herself playing second leads or character roles or taking to jatra. Not only did she retire from films, in a way, she retired from life. Again the speculations began and this time they continued for a long time. It was even suggested that she was suffering from a terminal disease. One does not know how she reacted to such rumours; perhaps she did not react at all. She had done a Greta Garbo act, she had done it consciously, and to her that was what mattered. Slowly the Suchitra Sen myth began to grow and it did her a world of good. Where would she have been if she had continued with a career that she herself had felt was on the point of sliding?

 Coming back to the award business. Even at the risk of annoying her admirers, it has to be said that if acting alone was the sole criterion, then there are other actors, even in Bengal, who deserve a thought. Did her name come up because of the myth surrounding her? Can that be a good enough reason alone? Kanan Bala had been similarly honoured, but it needs to be remembered that she had, in her own way, helped Bengali cinema find its feet. She was historically important, as was the man whose name the award carries. Suchitra Sen, unfortunately, played no such role. Yes, with her personality and background, she did bring in a whiff of fresh air, but if performance is to be considered, then actors such as Meena Kumari, Madhubala or Waheeda Rehman should have Sens admirers scratching their heads. Those who decide on a national award should take into account a wider view. And if it has to be somebody from this state, then why not Ritwik Ghatak whose contribution to cinema is beyond question. But then Ghatak did not manufacture dreams for adolescent afternoons.

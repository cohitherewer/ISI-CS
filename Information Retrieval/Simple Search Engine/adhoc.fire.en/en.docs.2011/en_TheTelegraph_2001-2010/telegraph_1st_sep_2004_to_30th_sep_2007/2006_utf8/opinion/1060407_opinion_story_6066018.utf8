 WITHERED STATE

 All opponents of the Left Front in West Bengal attack its political bankruptcy, quite overlooking the fact that under 29 years of left rule, the state is economically bankrupt. The comptroller and auditor general?s report on the state government finances (2004-05), which has just been made public, show the level of the bankruptcy in pretty stark terms. The interest paid by the state on its accumulated debts amounts to Rs 9,767 crore. This is practically equal to the total tax revenue ? Rs 9,924 crore ? that the state government collected. In addition, the state receives from the Centre Rs 10,741 crore under various heads and non-tax receipts. But the state government?s salary bill (including pensions) amounts to Rs 13,137 crore. The obvious conclusion is shocking: the state government begins with a deficit of over Rs 2,500 crore. Any work it does, any programme it undertakes only adds to this deficit. The West Bengal government would be bankrupt even if it remained completely idle and incurred no expenditure save payments for interest, salaries and pensions. This serves to explain why the total expenditure of the government has increased by about seven per cent over the last four years. In other words, government expenditure has grown at a lower rate than the rate of inflation. The precarious condition of public healthcare in West Bengal and of infrastructure can now be understood as a function of the shrinkage in the state?s activity which in turn is a result of the absolute lack of funds. This is a damning comment on any government and more so for a government in power for 29 years on a declared programme of welfare of the poor.

 The parlous state of West Bengal finances has fiscal mismanagement writ all over it. This despite the fact that it has a professional economist as the finance minister. No amount of shirking of responsibility can take away from the fact that over the years, the state has taken no corrective steps to avert this financial disaster. Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s vision of transforming the economy of West Bengal may well be halted by his government?s utter failure in managing the state?s finances. A bankrupt state is a bankrupt state is a bankrupt state.

 Letters to Editor

 Mind your own business

 Sir It is unfortunate that despite so many pressing social concerns, the Indian parliamentarians still had the time to raise a storm over cricket. Equally baffling is the fact that the media decided to devote so much attention to the hullabaloo, and even got Baba Ramdev to air his views. There is nothing new about Indian cricketers struggling on bouncy wickets. The media must ask the cricket board to prepare green tops in the country instead of paying attention to what politicians and godmen have to say in this matter. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Arnab Sarkar, Calcutta

 Minor flaws

 Sir According to the Sachar Committee, only 5 per cent of Muslims are employed in different governmental departments, agencies and institutions (Minority report paints grim picture, Dec 1). But Muslims are surely not the only minority community in the country. The committee should have also revealed the number of Christians, Buddhists and Sikhs who hold government jobs. That would have given a fair idea of the communal mindset which prevails among todays bureaucrats. To declare that only Muslims have been ignored when it comes to employment in government offices raises suspicions of electoral opportunism.

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir The report presented by the Sachar committee states that Dalits and Muslims are two of the poorest communities in the country. A majority of Dalits still lead a life of poverty and deprivation. It is true that some Dalits have managed to do well in life but they constitute only a small fraction of the community. The same logic applies to Muslims as well. A large number of poor Muslims do not have access to basic amenities like education and healthcare. However, reservation for Muslims is not going to change their lives in any dramatic way. If the government really wants to do something to improve the lot of Dalits and Muslims, it should create the job opportunities in order to help them improve their finances.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Although one does not have the temerity to dismiss the statistics revealed in the Sachar committee report, one still cannot help wonder what fraction of the Muslim population studies in mainstream institutions. Most Muslims attend madrasahs where they study the Quran, Arabic, a bit of mathematics and history. If these students were to be given fair employment, then the job market including administrative and police services needs to be restructured so that knowledge of the subjects taught in these institutions can help them get jobs. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Parting shot

 Sir The examination fee prescribed by the West Bengal Central School Service Commission is highly discriminatory. In case of applicants for headmasters in government-aided schools, the candidates must be in service for at least 10 years. But the commission has fixed Rs 500 as application fee for the general candidates and Rs 125 for those who belong to the SC/ST category. Presumably, both these categories of applicants are in service. Even their pay-scale is the same. Therefore there is no reason to fix a lower fee for candidates from the reserved categories. A person who is in service must not be given a benefit of this nature. There is no doubt about the fact that this particular policy is highly unfair. Will the School Service Commission please look into the matter at the earliest?

 Yours faithfully, 

 Kalipada Basu,Chinsurah, Hooghly

 GIRLS IN THE NEW WORLD

 NEHA SAHAY

 Heres an amazing success story. A teenager expelled from school last year is all set to go to Germany to learn classical music. 

 Sixteen-year-old Hayley (the English name chosen by Huang Haiying), ran into trouble when she entered senior school, which requires students to stay on campus. Equivalent to junior college in India, admission to senior school in China is based on grades obtained in the middle school-leaving exam. Ironically, living on campus is aimed at getting students to focus on preparing for university, without the distractions of living at home. 

 Hayley had got into the best senior school in her city, one of the new cities built on South Chinas coast. Her parents, well-paid professionals, were confident that she would make it to a good university in the provincial capital of Guangzhou. Imagine their shock when, barely four months into the first semester, the school called them up to ask where their daughter was. They traced her to a one-room apartment downtown, that she was sharing with her much older boyfriend a DJ at the citys most notorious discotheque to which she and her friends had been frequent visitors without her parents knowledge. 

 What followed was mayhem: the school expelled her; the parents insisted she stop seeing him; Hayley refused, even warning them that her boyfriend wouldnt hesitate to harm them. The police were informed; she was locked up in her room, with all communication between her and her parents at an end. The only time she left the house was to visit a counsellor, once a week, escorted by her mother. Interestingly, the parents, whod grown up during the Cultural Revolution, didnt go for counselling.

 Home and away

 Barely two months into counselling, Hayley left home. The parents first hunted for her at the apartment, and then took turns parking themselves at the discotheque at all hours, discovering a whole new cultural revolution in their city they would rather not have known. Unwilling to go to the police again, they decided to wait it out. We didnt say it to each other, but both of us were convinced wed lost her, recalls the mother.

 Surprising everyone, Hayley didnt go back to her boyfriend, but decided to earn her own living. Jobs for pretty teens are aplenty in Chinas coastal cities, but for those with a middle-school education, the choice is between waitresses and shop girls. Used to being attended to all her life, Hayley found herself on her feet in a tiny shop 10 hours at a stretch day after day, with barely 10 minutes to gulp down lunch, all for 600 yuan, one meal and a bed in a dorm. Yet, she stuck it out for a full four months before swallowing her pride and calling her mother. 

 Despite her aptitude for academics and their ambitions for her, the parents didnt want to risk sending Hayley to school again, away from them. Nor was Hayley keen to make her disgrace known to another school. Instead, she let herself be persuaded to go back to her other love: the piano. 

 With nothing else to distract her, Hayleys talent quickly blossomed enough to necessitate advanced lessons in Guangzhou, a good two hours away from her hometown. Twice a week, Hayley and her architect mother, who had put her career on hold, drove to Guangzhou and back. Six months later, the effort had paid off: Hayley had appeared for qualifying exams in Beijing, and been selected to study piano in Hanover. 

 But the mother hadnt anticipated such an outcome. If four months away from home in the same city had led her daughter astray, what would a year in the decadent West do? On the other hand, if she refused, she risked losing her daughter again, maybe forever, the counsellor warned her. She had to trust the teenager. 

 The passport is ready, so is Hayley. But the end of the story has yet to be written.

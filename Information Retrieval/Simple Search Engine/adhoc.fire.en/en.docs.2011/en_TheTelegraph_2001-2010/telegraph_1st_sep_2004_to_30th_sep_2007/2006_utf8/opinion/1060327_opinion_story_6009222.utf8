 Vital arm of democracy

 The media in theory is a vital arm of any democracy, reporting the news fully, fairly and freely, and commenting on it. Good reporting leads to investigative journalism as reporters probe the news for fuller information. The media?s role in documenting and discussing public opinion pushes governments to be accountable to the public, and impacts policymaking and legislation. It is the fourth estate, separate from the legislature, executive or judiciary. Unlike the other two, the higher judiciary and the media are not specifically accountable except to general public opinion.

 The media is helped in its work by handouts from government and other agencies. If not thoroughly investigated and if false or slanted to mislead, they become ?plants?. Many individuals, corporate organizations, even voluntary/non-profit ones, use such means. Public relations agencies are employed to project a desired point of view in the media. These agencies also often offer ?lobbying? services, that is, persuading people with power to a particular point of view and thus change legislation, rules, procedures, decisions, etc. In the United States of America, recent exposures reveal the web of connections and payments between lobbyists and legislators as well as the use of media by government to plant stories. Some Indian agencies also use money and other influences to induce favourable media responses.

 Some major print media even had a tariff card for printing news and photographs of personalities on their society pages. The tariffs vary depending on several key factors, such as editorial position, the column length, and accompanying photographs. When what is printed as news is actually paid for, and is therefore an advertisement, it misleads the reader who values genuine news above motivated advertising. The growing practice of featuring products in movies for which the film producer charges a fee to the manufacturer falls in the same category, although it is argued that the movie is itself fiction, and featuring a product in it for a fee cannot be objectionable.

 In an increasingly complex world where it is impossible to pursue all the news, there is some justification that PR agencies try to get specific messages published and noticed amidst the clutter of news and advertising. The media must take responsibility for what it publishes and not be paid to do so.

 Changing trends making the media more than a reporter and commentator are due to many factors resulting from intense competition and the substantial financial rewards for success. Many media today are moving beyond publishing bits of motivated news stories provided by PR Agencies. They are actually inventing news and aiming to add to circulation by being the first to publish particular news.

 The change in the media is also because of the vacuum created by the declining ability of government agencies to function efficiently and honestly. Police refuse to register a citizen?s complaint. When they do register it, they might word the first information report in a way that ensures the failure of the case when it comes to court. The investigating agencies are corruptible and influenced by powerful people to botch the investigation. In court, it is said, many prosecutors are happy to keep asking for adjournments, for a price paid by the defendants. All this is adding to the huge delays in hearing cases in courts, compounded by the shortage of judicial officers and rush of cases. Some court functionaries are influenced by power and pelf. Instances of these have been brought to public attention and will increase, until a mechanism is adopted to prevent such abuses.

 The lack of experienced editors and other supervisors, unable to read between the lines and insist on thorough investigation, and more concerned with winning the race for the latest scoop, leads to premature publication of news. In addition, the pressures of breaking news intensified by a competitive landscape with print, broadcast, online media and even some bloggers, put checking and cross-checking, the hallmarks of good journalism, on the backburner. The growing number of brash youngsters desperate to make a name and not always able to distinguish between the genuine and the planted information is another cause for publishing poorly investigated ?stories?.

 I have many times pointed out the ways in which the media accept the leaks from investigative agencies (like the enforcement directorate and the police) during the process of investigation and publish them as news. Since the late Eighties, corporate chieftains and distinguished managers and others have been tarred by such leaks from investigating agencies, with little opportunity for the accused to rebut them. This ?trial by media? was followed years later by courtroom trials in which the accused were found innocent. By then their reputations had been tarnished. After using these selective leaks, the media did no follow-up thereafter to track the progress of the charges.

 Television has transformed news presentation and enabled not merely reporting the news but also participation in making it. Many have attributed the duration and spread of the Gujarat killings after Godhra to the extensive television coverage and comment. Yet, we are not without responsible television as demonstrated by reporting of the recent bombing in the Sankat Mochan temple. Television reporting was immediate and an example of how a temperate media can, by responsible reporting, help prevent a communal conflagration. In a volatile country like India, the media and especially television, has a major responsibility for the way it reports and comments on events. But some television anchors have become active participants, trying to direct public opinion. The immediacy and brevity of television makes for high impact on the audience. Serious issues become entertainment and acquire high TRP ratings and advertising revenues. The reporter as newsmaker who tries to push his opinions on television is an excess that has come to stay since the Nineties.

 Television in India has now gone farther by mounting its own ?sting? operations. By tempting someone to accept a bribe (or sexual favours) on television, the reporter has become an actor and a newsmaker. While the practice may be ethically questionable, the extremely poor quality of police investigation and its readiness to be bought leaves only the media to expose such criminals. When wealthy criminals walk away free after buying up witnesses and investigators, there has to be an alternative. It has become the media.

 The best alternative is, of course, legal reform to deal with confessional evidence, witness protection, reforming criminal investigation and justice systems as well as the police. Many detailed proposals led by the classic report of the Rustomji Police Commission lie untouched. Meanwhile most crooked politicians and many bureaucrats and businessmen escape without punishment. Unfortunately, even when they are charged and found guilty, their punishment is a farce. Sting operations by the media to expose such wrongdoing and crimes, and when found guilty, their punishments, are therefore inevitable and will increase. There must be agreed rules in the media for such operations, the evidence must be usable and the medium must be made transparently accountable.

 Most recently, the media, particularly television, has gone farther by launching signature campaigns to compel the authorities to reopen cases that were dismissed because the evidence was flawed or the judgment was perverse. What was a function of the legislature as the watchdog of people?s rights, in which it has failed, has now been taken over by the media. 

 In the developing Indian context, the media are doing what in other democracies the legislature, executive and judiciary do. Even the higher Indian judiciary has stepped well beyond normal judicial responsibility. At present, neither the media nor the higher judiciary are accountable for their actions in performing these extended functions.

 Without hope

 Sir ? The report, ?Death row convict freed? (Feb 17), is evidence of all that is wrong with our judicial system. The accused in this case, Purnendu Patra and Rabin Jana, had been convicted for barbarically murdering Saraswati Guchait, a bidi-worker, and given a death and life sentence respectively only last year by a fast track court in Contai. And now, the high court has acquitted both of them. The fact that Patra, a member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist)?s branch committee in East Midnapore, and Jana, the party?s local committee member, are influential party workers, raises more questions. If this is the way convicted criminals are allowed to go scot-free, how do we continue to repose trust in the judiciary? Be it the case of Priyadarshini Mattoo, Jessica Lal or Saraswati Guchait, we have repeatedly seen that our judicial system has failed to provide justice. Presumably, the high and mighty are above the law of the land.

 As an ordinary citizen of this country, I would request the authorities concerned, including the National Commission for Women, the State Commission for Women, the police and the public to take up this case and either appeal against the verdict in the Supreme Court or to reinvestigate the matter so that justice is done. It is the least that we can do for Saraswati and for others like her.

 Yours faithfully,

Anirban Dasgupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? Media and public outrage at the acquittal of the accused in the Jessica Lal murder case has produced some result. Let us hope that the killer will be punished. However, one realizes that both the media and public have a selective memory and conscience. What about the innocent victims crushed under the wheels of an imported BMW in an early winter morning on Lodi road in Delhi some years back? In that case, the victims were poor workers and it was easier to buy off witnesses than in Jessica?s case. But if the can of worms, conveniently tucked away in some cupboard, was to be opened, the stink would perhaps reach the heavens. 

 Yours faithfully,

B.D. Chattopadhyaya, Uttarpara, Hooghly

 Sir ? Indian citizens have welcomed the Supreme Court?s awarding of a one-year prison term to Zahira Sheikh, a ?self-condemned liar? who changed her testimony for money (?Jessica message in Zahira jail?, March 9). The apex court justices have rightly observed that ?small flies? in our society are getting caught while seasoned criminals and the powerful are getting away. With corruption rampant in almost every level of the lower judiciary, the rich and influential can easily get a convenient verdict, as happened in the case of Jessica Lal and scores of others.

 There is no argument over the dictum that no innocent should be convicted unless proved guilty. But it is equally important for the judiciary to see that no perpetrator of crime walks away free, and without any fear of prosecution. In a country like India, the stacks are heavily loaded against the ordinary victims of crime. The criminal justice system in India is inherently flawed, so much so that even the chief justice of the country had to acknowledge that. While everyone agrees that ?justice delayed is justice denied?, a wealthy accused can easily drag a criminal case for decades using the loopholes in the system. Why only Zahira Sheikh, even members of the judiciary are found to be easily influenced by money. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Role back

 Sir ? The report,?Double-role trouble for MP Jaya? (March 7), where Jaya Bachchan is supposed to have been found complaining that it was a shame her family ?was not allowed to sit in the legislature?, makes it obvious that she knew that the allegation against her was not baseless. And yet the chairperson of the Uttar Pradesh film development board did not desist from blaming the Congress for her problem. The Election Commission would not have heeded the complaint of Congressman Madan Mohan Shukla had it been unjustified. Jaya Bachchan?s reference to the erudition of her family while arguing her case makes it more ridiculous. Has she forgotten that it was a Congress government that gave the awards to her family members? Perhaps she should be reminded that it was the commitment of the Bachchans to their art, and not dirty politics, that got them the awards. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

 Sir ? Very few would grudge the EC for issuing the directive against Jaya Bachchan, and it cannot be helped if she comes from an illustrious family of Padma recipients. The EC?s order should be honoured by Jaya Bachchan if she wants to retain her public image as the Bachchan bahu devoted to the cause of politics. 

 Yours faithfully,

Salil Gewali, Shillong

 Sir ? I fail to understand why the Election Commission took so long to realize that Jaya Bachchan was not qualified to become a Rajya Sabha member? Why did it not find reasons to disqualify her before someone else pointed out the irregularity? I think everyone knew the rules, but decided to keep mum as everyone was up to some mischief or another. It is impractical for a Rajya Sabha MP to waste time doing nothing for most part of the year. Instead of fighting among themselves, parties should amend the rules so that MPs can hold an office of profit simultaneously.

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

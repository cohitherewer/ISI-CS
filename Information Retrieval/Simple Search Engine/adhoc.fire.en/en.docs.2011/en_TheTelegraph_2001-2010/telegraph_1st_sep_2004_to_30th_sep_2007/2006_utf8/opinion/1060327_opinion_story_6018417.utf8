 OLD FAITHFUL

 Anil Biswas, whose death was formally announced last evening, was a modest man even though he had no reasons to be modest. During his tenure as the general secretary of the West Bengal unit of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), he was among the most powerful men in the state. But he never made a display of this power. On the contrary, he preferred the backroom to the limelight. When he could not avoid the limelight, he chose to back into it rather than to embrace it. This self-effacing quality grew from the fact that Biswas saw himself as first and foremost a loyal worker of the CPI(M). This to him was his most important identity; the position and the trappings of power came later and were in a sense incidental. He was an organization man. The invincible electoral juggernaut of the CPI(M) was run by him and was, to a large extent, his own creation. Biswas had learnt the basics of running the party apparatus from Promode Dasgupta, whose prot?g? he was with Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Mr Biman Bose. If P.C. Joshi, the legendary general secretary of the undivided Communist Party of India, chose the best and the brightest among the youth to lead the party, Dasgupta preferred to train ordinary young men to rise to the demands and requirements of the CPI(M). Biswas was Dasgupta?s cupbearer and he fulfilled the latter?s faith that the ordinary would inherit the party and West Bengal. Biswas left his indelible mark not only on the party?s organization but also in the field of education over which he established his personal control through the appointment of trusted lieutenants in key positions.

 Biswas was trained as a dyed-in-the-wool Stalinist. He abhorred the refinements of Marxian analysis. But his ingrained Stalinism did not stand in the way of pragmatic politics. When Mr Bhattacharjee, as chief minister, led the charge to reform the economy of West Bengal by making it investor-friendly, he found in comrade Biswas an enthusiastic ally. This freed the chief minister from unnecessary hassles. Biswas looked after the party and Mr Bhattacharjee wooed capital. It was the almost perfect political partnership. With Biswas?s death, the chief minister?s responsibility increases and his task becomes more complicated. He has to work out his equations with the party without the assistance of a loyal ally. Nobody is indispensable, especially in a party like the CPI(M), which is driven by its own organizational momentum, but Biswas will be a tough act to emulate. He, together with Mr Bhattacharjee, has set the agenda for West Bengal?s future. The new secretary will have to face the challenge of new times.

 Letters to Editor

 Death and the maidens

 Sir The report, On tomato diet, model dies (Nov 18), should be an eye-opener to thousands of teenage girls and weight watchers who take to drastic dieting without consulting qualified dieticians. A number of weight-reducing centres have sprouted all over the city, mostly with no qualified doctors to supervise the diet charts and exercises. There are instances where youngsters have had heart attacks while doing their workouts. The government should make it compulsory for these units to have trained hands to tackle emergencies. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Ashok S. Mehta, Calcutta 

 Care where it is due 

 Sir The books and artefacts lying in neglect at the Bangiya Sahitya Parishad would have been considered national wealth in any other part of the world (Care for fair, not library, Nov 10). It is only in India that they can gather dust without being preserved and maintained. Couldnt the chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, spare a thought for the cobwebbed books in the shelves of the Bangiya Sahitya Parishad, when he sells culture through events like the book fair and film festival? The money wasted on inconsequential events, such as the laying of foundation stones and inaugurations, could easily be spent on saving the books, journals, manuscripts and artefacts rotting away at the Bangiya Sahitya Parishad. 

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir The decrepit condition of the Bangiya Sahitya Parishad should come as no surprise to a resident of West Bengal. The state, which is reputed to be the cultural hub of India, is also the one in which some of the most appalling instances of indifference towards history and heritage are to be found. Only a few days ago, rainwater seeped into the newly built Bhasha Bhavan of the National Library, threatening to damage the priceless books housed there. It is not known whether the central public works department has undertaken the necessary repair works yet. Who knows, the next monsoons may witness a repeat of the incident. The Bangiya Sahitya Parishad authorities can rest safe, no one will be pulled up for dereliction of duty. In this context, the theft of Rabindranath Tagores Nobel medal from Santiniketan could be mentioned. Perhaps it is only a matter of time before the treasures lying around in the Bangiya Sahitya Parishad are stolen as well. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shreya Dutta, Calcutta 

 An appeal

 Sir Rakesh Biswas, a third-year student of information technology at Beliaghata Government College of Engineering and Ceramic Technology and an alumnus of Krishnagar Collegiate School, has sustained serious injuries to his spine and the lower portion of his body owing to a fall from a considerable height. Rakesh had initially been admitted to the SSKM Hospital. He needed an immediate neuro-orthopaedic operation. But as the rush of patients at SSKM kept delaying it, he was shifted to Vellore Christian Medical College on November 17. For his sustained treatment, about Rs 2.5 lakh is needed. About Rs 25,000 has already been collected. Since Rakesh comes from a lower-middle-class family, we appeal to all the alumni of Krishnagar Collegiate School and others to provide financial assistance and save a promising life. For making donations, cheques and drafts should be sent to Krishnagar Collegiate School Alumni Association Rakesh Biswas Benevolence Fund, opened with UTI Bank, Krishnagar branch. Money orders and cash may be sent to Dilip Kumar Guha, Alumni Association, Krishnagar Collegiate School, Krishnagar, Nadia.

 Yours faithfully,

Dilip Kumar Guha, Krishnagar

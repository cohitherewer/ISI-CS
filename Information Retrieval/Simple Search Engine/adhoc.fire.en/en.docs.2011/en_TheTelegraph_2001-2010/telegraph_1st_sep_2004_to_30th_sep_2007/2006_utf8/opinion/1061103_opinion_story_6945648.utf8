 Darkness under the lamp

 Alternative Economic Survey, India 2005-2006: Disempowering Masses (Daanish, Rs 275) by the Alternative Survey Group is a crucial document that has been compiled by some of the best minds in the Indian academia. It peels off the layers of shine to present an India, which is often hidden away carefully from the public gaze. The 13th edition of the AES makes use of sound theories, irrefutable logic and established facts to bring out disturbing aspects about Indias socio-economic reality. For instance, studies have pointed out that the countrys much-touted GDP growth has not made much of a difference to the quality of life led by the common man. There are also references to the crisis brewing in Indias agriculture sector, and its increasingly fragile environment. The essays and the accompanying statistics give credence to the belief that what goes by the name of economic empowerment in India is often a cleverly disguised attempt to mislead people into believing that the poor shall inherit the earth.

 Tiger Tales: Tracking the big cat across Asia (Penguin, Rs 350) Edited by K. Ullas Karanth tries to unlock the doors of tiger library, with remarkable results. The anthology can be divided into three parts. The first, comprising some of the earliest essays on the tiger, examines the modus operandi of tiger hunts in colonial times. The second refers to the era of new natural history, which was characterized by the first fledgling steps at protecting this magnificent beast. The third and final section takes a look at modern day conservation methods that are in use. A fine blend of adventure and science makes the task of reading the book a pleasure.

 Terrorism and other themes: Politics, principles and practice (Seagull, Rs 325) by Robi Chakravorti comprises a collection of articles that can be described in the words of the author as an attempt at academic journalism. The spectre of terror has recently spawned a vast body of literature, which aims at analyzing and under- standing this global phenomenon. Chakravortis book, in a sense, is an extension of this theme. It illustrates the complexities that bind politics, nations and themes in a particular historical setting, resulting in ideological practices being given different meanings at the same point of time.

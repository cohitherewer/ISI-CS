 DEFINING CONFLICT AND JUSTICE

 DOCUMENT

 From the US Supreme Courts June 2006 ruling on the Guantnamo trials

 Hamdan: trying time

 The DC Circuit ruled that Common Article 3 is inapplicable to Hamdan because the conflict with al Qaeda is international in scope and thus not a conflict not of an international character. That reasoning is erroneous. That the quoted phrase bears its literal meaning and is used here in contradistinction to a conflict between nations is demonstrated by Common Article 2, which limits its own application to any armed conflict between signatories and provides that signatories must abide by all terms of the Conventions even if another party to the conflict is a nonsignatory, so long as the nonsignatory accepts and applies those terms. 

 Common Article 3, by contrast, affords some minimal protection, falling short of full protection under the Conventions, to individuals associated with neither a signatory nor even a nonsignatory who are involved in a conflict... 

 Syllabus

 ...The latter kind of conflict does not involve a clash between nations...

 (iii) While Common Article 3 does not define its regularly constituted co- urt phrase, other sources define the words to mean an ordinary military cour[t] that is established and organized in accordance with the laws and procedures already in force in a country.

 ...At a minimum, a military commission can be regularly constituted only if some practical need explains deviations from court-martial practice. No such need has been demonstrated here. Pp. 6970.

 (iv) Common Article 3s requirements are general, crafted to accommodate a wide variety of legal systems, but they are requirements nonetheless. The commission convened to try Hamdan does not meet those requirements. P. 72.

 (d) Even assuming that Hamdan is a dangerous individual who would cause great harm or death to innocent civilians given the opportunity, the Executive ...must comply with the prevailing rule of law in undertaking to try him and subject him to criminal punishment. P. 72.

 Justice Stevens, joined by Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer, concluded in Parts V and VI D iv:

 1. The Government has not charged Hamdan with an offense...that by the law of war may be tried by military commission, 10 USC 821. Of the three sorts of military commissions used historically, the law-of-war type used in Quirin and other cases is the only model available to try Hamdan. Among the preconditions, incorporated in Article of War 15 and, later, UCMJ Art. 21, for such a tribunals exercise of jurisdiction are, inter alia, that it must be limited to trying offences committed within the convening commanders field of command...Here, Hamdan is not alleged to have committed any overt act in a theatre of war or on any specified date after September 11, 2001.

 More importantly, the offense alleged is not triable by law-of-war military commission. Although the common law of war may render triable by military commission certain offences not defined by statute, Quirin, 317 US, at 30, the precedent for doing so with respect to a particular offence must be plain and unambiguous...e.g., Loving v. United States, 517 US 748, 771. That burden is far from satisfied here. The crime of conspiracy has rarely if ever been tried as such in this country by any law-of-war military commission not exercising some other form of jurisdiction, and does not appear in either the Geneva Conventions or the Hague Conventions...Moreover, that conspiracy is not a recognized violation of the law of war is confirmed by other international sources, including...the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, which pointedly refused to recognize conspiracy to commit war crimes as such a violation. Because the conspiracy charge does not support the commissions jurisdiction, the commission lacks authority to try Hamdan.

 2. The phrase all the guarantees...recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples in Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions is not defined, but it must be understood to incorporate at least the barest of the trial protections recognized by customary international law. The procedures adopted to try Hamdan deviate from those governing courts-martial in ways not justified by practical need, and thus fail to afford the requisite guarantees. Moreover, various provisions of Commission Order No. 1 dispense with the principles, which are indisputably part of customary international law, that an accused must, absent disruptive conduct or consent, be present for his trial and must be privy to the evidence against him. Pp. 7072...

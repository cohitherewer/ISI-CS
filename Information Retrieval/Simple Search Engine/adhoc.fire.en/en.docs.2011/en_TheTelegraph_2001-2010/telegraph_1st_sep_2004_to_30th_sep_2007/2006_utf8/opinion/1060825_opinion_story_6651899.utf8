 TURKISH DESIRES

 - A city of dangerous liaisons 

 The Janissary Tree 

 By Jason Goodwin 

 Faber, Rs 395

 A dark, handsome and solitary man, physically fit but tragically deprived, a man of simple living and sophisticated pleasures, with an acute mind and a delicate touch in cooking, is an irresistible draw as a detective. Yashim Togalu, investigator and eunuch, who appears for the first time in Jason Goodwins The Janissary Tree, set in 19th-century Istanbul, is as enigmatic, and as seething, as the richly corrupt city he inhabits. The Janissary Tree is the story of a sprawling centre of trade, politics and different cultures burdened with many histories, caught at a moment when it seems to be teetering on the brink of dissolution. With its evocation of dangerous alleys and shadowed interiors, of glittering, heavily guarded corridors leading to the harem and the brooding courtyards of the sultans palace, of the stinking field covered with vast and bubbling tanning vats with miles of tunnels under them, the tinsmiths workshops and the soup-makers guild, the dizzying fire-towers and noisy waterfront, marketplaces, churches, mosques and synagogues, secret rooms and even more secret implements in them, minarets, domes and crowded wooden houses that burn like tinder, the novel offers a spectacular and restless experience and leaves the reader longing for a map.

 There are obvious advantages to having a eunuch as detective in a story of the Ottoman Empire in 1836. Yashim can move as easily among the harem as he can among the soup-makers. He numbers among his closest friends Stanislaw Palewski, ambassador of a Poland that no longer exists, the still beautiful Valid Sultan, the mother of the ruling Sultan Mahmut II and the woman who lends Yashim Les Liaisons Dangereuses, as well as Preen, the seductive, loyal and irrepressible kek, a traditional transvestite dancer, who can lure any man into involuntary revelations in smoky and menacing drinking joints in order to help a friend. These characters grow upon the reader, credible yet elusive, participating in the spirit of the time and the place while contributing to the action and drama around the central mystery. 

 This is Goodwins first work of fiction, two of his earlier works being a travelogue of Istanbul and a history of the Ottoman Empire. Its vivacity is evidence of the authors enjoyment of his chosen subject. But that has its drawbacks too. The novel sprawls, as does the city in which it is set, and that makes it tougher to hold on to the tension of the detective story. The strands of that tale is entangled with the past as well. The middle-aged sultan is busy changing and modernizing old systems and customs to keep in step with the rest of Europe. This cannot be done without resistance, and the promise of a surprise edict on the day of the sultans inspection of his favoured New Guard increases the tension of the imminent climax. For the day of the inspection, ten days from the commencement of the story, is also Yashims deadline. He has been ordered by the seraskier, the sultans commander-in-chief, to find out who has abducted four young officers of the guard. Almost predictably, the first of these young men is found murdered the next day, and other corpses soon follow. 

 Yashim, familiar with intrigue, is faced with a terrifying puzzle. Is this a plot by the surviving but ousted Janissaries, once the elite corps but later grown corrupt and violent, which had been ruthlessly put down by the sultan during one of its rebellions ten years ago? There is no end to plotting the sultan himself was suspected to have fomented the Janissaries rebellion in 1826 so that he could bring in a modern and disciplined army in its place. They seem to exist in 1836 in a secret society, with its own codes and religion, a strange derivation of Sufism. At the same time there are also the avaricious Russians, intent on their own plots to sabotage the Ottomans, and an assassin who can only see in the dark. 

 But this is not the end of Yashims troubles. The Valid Sultan has asked him to locate her stolen jewels. Napoleon had given them to her, for his empress Josephine and Mahmut IIs mother had once been inseparable friends as two little French girls in Haiti. Tied up with this burglary is the murder of a young concubine, who had been bathed, perfumed, and made ready for her turn in the sultans bed for the first time in her life. A mark on her finger from where a ring has been taken off is as bothersome a clue for Yashim as the grisly sight of a faceless corpse in a huge soup cauldron.

 The tautness of the narrative is occasionally, but only occasionally, overwhelmed by the rush of colour, character and event. It seems that the author cannot always resist the temptation of displaying the variety and eccentricity of 19th-century Istanbul life, even if it distracts the reader. But the scenes of suspense and violence are unrelieved by frills, and there are many of those. It is perhaps not surprising that the two mysteries that Yashim sets out to solve should come to a single climax, although the climax itself is a little more dispersed than would be allowed by the logical perfection expected at the close of a detective story. But this is not the usual detective story, neither is Yashim the usual detective. He is a eunuch who is a freelance, and quite a satisfactory lover as well. Goodwin has put together a magic mix, using the recent craze for period thrillers to blend serious scholarship and a strong sense of history with romance, intrigue, blood-lust and adventure in a vividly imaged, stylish tale.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Shovelfuls of money 

 MADE FOR MAHARAJAS (Roli, Rs 4,500) by the curator of the Asian department of Londons Victoria and Albert Museum, Amin Jaffer, is subtitled A Design Diary of Princely India. The standard British view of the maharajas in the Twenties was that they had nothing else to do except live in luxury and spend money with a shovel. This book tells a story of mutual fascination: the maharajas and their ranis with England and Europe, and vice versa. The best designers, photographers, salonieres, jewellers, hatmakers and glovers of the Western world wooed and worked for these bizarrely cosmopolitan, jetsetting Indians (remember the Maharajah of Pukkapore in Waughs Vile Bodies, who marries Mary Mouse?). The women in this book look exquisitely idle (Gayatri Devi, top right) or chicly forlorn, whereas most of the men look opulently unshapely except for the Maharaja Yeshwant Rao Holkar II of Indore, left, painted here by Bernard Boutet de Monvel. (Man Ray had also photographed him.) Bottom right is a rosewood and silver bed by Christofle for Nawab Muhammad Bahawal Khan Abbasi V of Bahawalpur. The four bronze women represent France, Spain, Italy and Greece.

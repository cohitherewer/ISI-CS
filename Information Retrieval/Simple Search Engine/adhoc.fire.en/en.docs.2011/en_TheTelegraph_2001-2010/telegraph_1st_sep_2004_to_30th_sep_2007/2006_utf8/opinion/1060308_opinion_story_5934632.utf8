 Explosive matter

 Sir ? Now that George W. Bush has had his photo-op in front of the Purana Qila, it?s time to mull over the implications of the nuclear deal. First, even if all the nuclear reactors proposed in the deal become functional and perform to capacity, the total electricity generated in 2020 will meet just 5 per cent of India?s electricity needs, and just 2 per cent of its total energy needs. As a matter of fact, nuclear reactors have become unpopular as a source of energy worldwide and the US itself has not commissioned a single reactor in over 30 years. Second, India has to open up its civilian reactors to inspection in perpetuity. It has been denied both nuclear-weapons-state status and even the right to be a member of the Nuclear Suppliers Group. Also, the spent fuel will have to be returned rather than used in India?s fast breeder programme. This is nothing but limiting India?s nuclear capacity indirectly. 

 One also needs to know what secret protocols are hidden in the agreement. Recall that Indian air force?s requirement of 126 combat aircraft has suddenly been revised upwards without a stated limit, and the earlier (and logical) demand for aircraft from a single source has been replaced by a demand for aircraft from multiple sources. Besides, is there any guarantee that the Americans will not twist India?s arms later? What if there is a demand now to participate militarily in the upcoming invasion of Iran? It is just not logical to say that the deal is independent of India?s attitude to Iran or Iraq. For surely the money that India pays for this deal will fuel the American military machine. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Media reports on the visit of the American president are evidence that the predominant feeling is that George W. Bush is good for India. I think the feeling is misplaced. We should be wary of falling into the trap of staying selfishly nuclear by striking a deal with the US and continuing to stay away from signing the NPT. We have to go beyond and look into the motives of an American administration that has, for no just cause or reason, invaded two countries and brutalized their citizens. Another major reason for the pro-Bush sentiment is the media?s strong antipathy towards the left and Islamic fundamentalists. The left and Muslim protesters may have their biases, but that does not mean the rest have lost their ability to analyse issues independently. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? It was a ?triumphant? Bush who left India for Pakistan. And why not? A president who has a 34 per cent approval rating, is supposed to be out of office in two years, and is burdened with a sordid record of disastrous deeds, both in international and national politics, has successfully conned a pliant India into agreeing to a deal which the country will rue some day. India allowed Bush to get away talking glibly about ?freedom and democracy? despite knowing that Bush himself is out to truncate the freedoms of his own citizens to promote his businessmen benefactors. Take his policy on tax cuts, privatization of health services, relentless pursuit of crony capitalism and the increasing evidence of his nexus with oil and other big business. India is also not bothered about the fact that Bush pays lip-service to clean (nuclear) energy, but does everything in his power to endanger the environment by promoting fossil fuel energy. Witness his refusal to sign the Kyoto Protocol and his successful pressurizing of the US Congress to allow drilling for oil in the pristine Alaskan heartland. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Why was Pakistan not offered the same nuclear deal? It has been a long-term ally of the US and a participant in the war on terror. After the A.Q. Khan imbroglio, there should have been more US interest in supporting Pakistan to make its nuclear programme more legitimate. Why the insistence that India specify its nuclear facilities, segregate them as military and civilian and then put the latter under the inspection regime of the International Atomic Energy Agency? The intervention of international agencies like the IAEA will effectively blunt the edge of India?s nuclear programme and nullify India?s deterrent programme to keep neighbouring atomic states like Pakistan and China at a distance. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The main purpose of the US?s nuclear deal with India is to impose some degree of control over the latter?s nuclear technology and make it dependent on US cooperation. The effect of this will be some degree of political control too, as a growing nation depends on energy resources to a great extent. Since India is not a party to the NPT, this is the only way the US can make it serve its interests.

 The US has not built a nuclear power plant for years and lags behind France, Germany, Japan and Sweden in nuclear power plant technology. India should have signed contracts with France or Sweden or Germany. But, of course, Manmohan Singh is an economist and not an engineer. George Bush is actually responding to the needs of the powerful energy companies who want lucrative contracts in India. Their recent performance in Iraq is certainly not stellar. Closer home, the record of Enron?s effort at Dabhol should serve as a warning about the quality of US performance in India.

 Yours faithfully,

Partha Sur, New Jersey, US

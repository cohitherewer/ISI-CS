The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 WRONG PLACE TO TAP

 MALVIKA SINGH

 What a strange way to start the New Year ? to have Prakash Karat tell us with a smirk on his face that the private sector should never have been allowed to enter the telecommunications sector because someone broke the law and indulged in phone tapping. It all sounded so utterly ridiculous that one had to pinch oneself to make sure one was reading it right. What has illegal phone tapping got to do with allowing the private sector to own phone companies? If someone breaks the law, that person should be punished by the tenets of the law. What has it got to do with FDI or competitive business? The CPI(M) seems obsessed with going for the jugular of the UPA regardless of the issue. It is bizarre. Many Indians began this year by being hugely embarrassed, intellectually, by such platitudes. Something has gone wrong with the rhetoric of left opposition, much akin to the rising flame of a dying wick.

 And then, a newspaper headline: ?Splurgers beware, the taxman is watching you.? Is it undemocratic to splurge? Is it against the law to spend your own hard-earned money or your inheritance? Is this yet another way of encouraging the tax department to harass the citizen, as we have experienced for decades, and thereby increase extortion? That?s how it has always been done...the conscious crooks get away by ?fixing? it, by ?sharing? their unaccounted for money, and innocents become the scapegoats as ?quotas? are completed. Is this a new authorization to question spending, a new year?s gift to tax inspectors so that they can continue to ?splurge? at the cost of citizens of India? Instead, why doesn?t the government write simple, straightforward rules, with no addenda, so that there is no ?interpretation? required. The rules should apply to all professional and non-professional groups including government babus and politicians. For a change, give India a new year present.

 Naked authority

 Both these happenings are symbols of the madness that has enveloped us, a midsummer madness in the dead of winter, where the horrors of past errors and mistaken policies have begun to unravel. Politicians and bureaucrats are running for cover as exposures of all kinds, from sex scandals to fingers in the till to breaking municipal rules to extortion have hit the headlines. Ministers, having broken municipal rules, are pulling rank by demanding they be spared the rule of law. Their cronies are publicly and shamelessly protesting against legal play. The fa?ade of correctness has been stripped away.

 Leaders across the country, along with their lieutenants, look naked, devoid of the veneer that has protected them so far. This kind of ?authority? cannot govern India and be respected by citizens. No one can take administrators seriously when they are the first to break the law, leading to rampant lawlessness. It is shameful.

 This blatant support of corruption and lawlessness by those who are in public positions to administer the law and provide dignity and order for society at large is the last sign of a torn social fabric and a failed state. To think that an ancient, progressive culture that attracted explorers and merchants from across the unknown seas to its unique riches and strengths, should come to such a pass only jolts one into the realization that the system has degraded itself, lost all sense of morality and integrity and has compelled India into becoming a defunct nation.

 We are a large and hungry market. We are an energetic and thinking people who live within a fragile democratic framework and not in an autocratic polity. We are an extremely patient one billion beings. However, resilient Indians have bettered themselves despite bungling governance. Will the present dispensation at the Centre wake up and deliver a fresh, clean package to us that will restore a semblance of pride for a start?

 CORE OF MYSTERY

AN ENCHANTED SPACE: THE PRIVATE WORLD OF GANESH PYNE 

(CIMA, price not mentioned) by Sovon Som catalogues a recent exhibition 

of this master of the modern art of Bengal. But the best paintings remain the 

older ones, from the Seventies to the early Nineties. In the more recent paintings, 

the enchantments come a bit too easily and even risk the decorative. One misses 

that old inscrutability, a richly allusive mysteriousness that drew from a baffling 

range of cultural and private sources. Of special interest here are the undated 

?jottings?, which bring together visual and literary ?note-book? entries, out 

of which the larger and more finished paintings grow. Poems, sketches and doodles 

jostle with one another to create densely cross-hatched inward spaces from which 

singular images glimmer out. It would be sad if Pyne?s art loses this obscure 

and difficult core. This is The Mask, 2005.

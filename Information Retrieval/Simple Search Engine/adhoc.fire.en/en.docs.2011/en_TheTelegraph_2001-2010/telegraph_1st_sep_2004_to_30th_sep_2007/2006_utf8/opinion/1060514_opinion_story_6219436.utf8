The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 The exchange of single red roses between the crowned queen of Rae Bareli and the deposed raja of Chhattisgarh, Ajit Jogi, did nothing to undo the dressing down the latter had received in the course of D-day for daring to initiate the letter campaign for a change of prime minister. Apart from the move being completely unabashed, there were ample doubts about the veracity of the letter. In fact, by last Thursday evening, Congress MPs were already joking about it, and the key to their mirth lay in Jogi?s past record. A few years ago, ABA Ghani Khan?s signature was found to have mysteriously appeared during a parliamentary vote despite the fact that Barkatda was absent from the house. Fingers were pointed at Jogi, but the case was dropped with the dissolution of the assembly. A similar thing happened in 2003, when Jogi submitted a letter to the Chhattisgarh governor, complete with names of six BJP MLAs as well, supporting an alternative government in the state. The saffron legislators promptly disowned their dalliances with Jogi and pointed to the former CM?s attempts at bribing them. The matter greatly embarrassed the Congress, forcing it to severe ties with Jogi. Wonder why Jogi should be risking his comeback with another of his letters! 

 Pramod Mahajan?s death seems to be doing his party a lot of good, and a lot of bad. First the good. The ?martyrdom? of Mahajan has so overwhelmed the Maharashtra CM, Vilasrao Deshmukh, that despite consternation within his party, he has decided not to put up a candidate if the BJP fields any family member from Mahajan?s immediate family for the Rajya Sabha seat which has fallen vacant. The NCP chief, Sharad Pawar too has expressed similar wishes. On the other hand, the BJP president, Rajnath Singh, is reported to be in a state following the death of his adviser. Singh is being blamed for the unsuccessful rath yatras as also for his failure to hold the national executive of the party, which, according to the party?s constitution, is supposed to happen every three months. Singh, said to be thoroughly confused, has already changed his mind thrice over the venue and time ? from Guwahati in March, to Ludhiana on the 26th of this month, to Delhi on the May 30. Hey Ram!

 Uma Bharti?s new party, Bharatiya Janshakti Party, sounds suspiciously similar to her alma mater, the BJP. This alone should be reason to keep her ?BJP? in mind. But that isn?t how it works with her former party colleagues. Take Rajnath Singh. Addressing an election rally, Singh mentioned the three candidates in the fray ? from the Congress, from the Samajwadi Party, and the third from ?a little party whose name I cannot recall?. A mighty snub or is his memory going as well?

 The two Union ministers of state for commerce and industry ? Ashwani Kumar and Jairam Ramesh ? have been a source of much amusement to their ministerial colleagues ever since they began their tenure by squabbling over a room at the Udyog Bhavan. They have grown much quieter since. Recently, when their senior minister, Kamal Nath, was heard complaining about the number of social gatherings he had to attend, one of the bureaucrats in his ministry had a wonderful idea. Why not allocate the weddings to be attended to one junior minister and the funerals to another? Last heard, Nath was seriously mulling over the idea. 

 For Pramod Mahajan?s friends and associates, even his death was an event management assignment. Though ostensibly organized by the Delhi BJP, the entire operation ? from visualizing the billboards with a smiling Mahajan, to the Pandit Jasraj recital, to the condolence meet at the Talkatora auditorium ? was handled by the PR people and tentwallahs who had become synonymous with the media-savvy saffronite. Meanwhile, a private airline operator is said to have flown doctors in and out free of cost while a prominent hotelier hosted them. Their way of repaying their debts to the departed leader.

 Rahul Gandhi seems to have finally managed to get rid of his ?baba log? tag. But it has been quite a gruelling effort. His drill in Rae Bareli included visiting several villages a day in the 44 degree Celsius heat. Though not as spontaneous as his sister, Rahul did earn points for his manners, team spirit and good conduct. He also proved to be a quick learner, devising his own way of blessing new tractors as demanded of him by doggedly loyal villagers. Congressmen who were initially dismissive of him are believed to have changed their opinion about Rahul. The Nehru-Gandhi scion is now being looked at as a ?lambi race ki ghoda?. Which is probably why many wish to preserve him in the air-conditioned comfort of the office of the AICC general secretary. But there are others, more ?well-meaning?, who want to see him rough it out in UP in order to force a mother of a battle. For that Rahul needs to tour a district every second day. Will Mama let him?

 AN AMERICAN TRAGEDY

 A CASE FOR PHILIP ROTH

 Ignored for so long, is it now too late in the day to give the Jewish enfant terrible the Nobel?

 Another year without the Nobel Prize for Philip Roth. Perhaps the most important living American novelist, Roth has allegedly spent a decade among the also-rans for the Nobel. For a long time now, writers and critics have been crying themselves hoarse trying to persuade the Nobel committee. There is a whole industry on the Continent arguing Roths Nobeligibility. Harold Bloom once sighed that he had tried but didnt know anymore whether he would ever convince Stockholm: [Roths] not terribly politically correctAnd they are. With the multicultural and feminist credentials of the Nobel, it is not surprising at all. Or perhaps Roth has been too funny, too sarcastic, ever since Portnoy, to be taken as seriously as John Updike or Thomas Pynchon? 

 The notorious and prolific literary career begun with Goodbye, Columbus (1959), and made (in)famous by Portnoys Complaint (1969), had been slipping into an acute self-obsession with each new Zuckerman instalment in the Eighties. But, The Counterlife (1986), Roths twelfth full-length novel was a turnaround. Yet, the best hadnt come.

 After a rather restrained review by John Updike of Operation Shylock (1993), his split with Claire Bloom and the publication of her memoir Leaving a Dolls House, Roth checked himself into a psychiatric hospital claiming that he was near suicide. One doesnt know what really happened in there, except for the anti-depressants, but he came out and wrote as if he lived on borrowed time. He hit the market with Sabbaths Theater (1995). Then came American Pastoral (1997), I Married a Comm- unist (1998), The Human Stain (2000), The Dying Animal (2001) and The Plot Against America (2004) a phase that Salman Rushdie has called Roths late blast and his best. Old but reborn, Roth was re-inventing himself and America over and over again while his peers, great masters of the craft themselves, were all falling into quietude and losing their touch. Between 1991 and 2000, Roth won five major awards as well as a Pulitzer. He is only the third author, after Eudora Welty and Saul Bellow, to have his works published by The Library of America while still alive. In 1998, handing Roth the National Medal of the Arts, Bill Clinton said that Roth has done for Newark what Joyce did for Dublin and Faulkner for the South. And the Library of Congress, on its bicenten- ary, pronounced him a living legend.

 Why then has the Nobel eluded him? Never mind that he doesnt campaign for it, Roth alas is an incorrigible misogynist. Jewish-American fiction is well past its heyday, and he doesnt like being called a Jewish writer although he writes mostly about Jews. The Left doesnt like him because he calls their bluff and lambasts their hypocrisies. The Right hates him because he has always hated the Right. He parodied the Nixon administration in Our Gang (1971). He has projected the Bush administration back onto the past in The Plot Against America where he remakes American and Jewish history by letting Charles Lindbergh win against Roosevelt in 1940 and turn the US into a de-facto Nazi state. 

 Roth will not get the Nobel because we are no longer comfortable with self-lacerating writers who possess a brutal intellectual honesty. And who dont mind lacerating others for the sake of their art, who steadfastly refuse to please anybody. A writer, these days, must choose some pet EU concerns for the big one. 

 This troublesome pupil of Kafka, Chekov and Dostoyevsky, who brought the likes of Ivan Klma to the West, retreated into the woods of solitude he had explored in The Ghost Writer (1979) and turned inwards after his crises of the Nineties. Thus was rekindled a tremendous interest in the world outside and the people inhabiting it. 

 Each of the late novels is technically complex, yet without pretensions, and boasts one of the best handlings of English on either side of the Atlantic. But, their author, at seventy-three, is of a dying breed. Understandably, his last work, Everyman (2005), is a meditation on death. For an author who, according to Cynthia Ozick, has transcended that low word career and become the thing-in-itself, a Nobel next year, or later still, will, in fact, be insult added to injury. Instead, let him be another Borges.

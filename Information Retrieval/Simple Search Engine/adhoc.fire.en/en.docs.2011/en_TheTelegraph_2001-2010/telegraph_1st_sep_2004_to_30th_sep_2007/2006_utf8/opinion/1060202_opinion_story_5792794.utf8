 IN A SHADOW

 Peace negotiations are ultimately an act of faith. The ceasefire in Nagaland is based on the faith that it will lead to a peaceful end to the decades-old Naga rebellion. A shadow seems to have been cast on this faith during the latest round of peace talks between New Delhi and the National Socialist Council of Nagalim, led by Mr Isak Chishi Swu and Mr Thuingaleng Muivah. It is not difficult to see why the Naga leaders are questioning the purpose of the peace process. Even after eight years of the ceasefire, the political issues that sparked the rebellion remain unresolved. Both sides have always agreed that the ceasefire is a means to an end. Finding a mutually agreeable solution to the political issues remains the larger goal of the peace initiative. That the NSCN has agreed to extend the truce, by six months instead of by a year, should be a signal to New Delhi to look at the peace process more closely. The extension of the truce is a sign of hope for peace in Nagaland. But the agreement comes also with a warning that New Delhi cannot afford to ignore. Mr Muivah deserves to be complimented for not letting his misgivings destroy the hope.

 However, the Naga leaders cannot be unaware of the complicated angles to the Naga issues. The most intractable of them has been the territorial question. The NSCN leaders want all Naga-inhabited areas in the North-east to be integrated into a single territorial unit. That will involve slicing away areas from Manipur, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. The people in these states react suspiciously ? and sometimes violently ? to any such idea. New Delhi has to be extremely cautious in dealing with the Nagas? territorial demand. No government can afford to ignore the sentiments of the people in these states. Even the NSCN?s demand for ?sovereignty? is a difficult proposition. How the government deals with it may be crucial to future peace talks with other rebel groups in the region. The complexity of the issues cannot be wished away by either New Delhi or the Naga leaders. But the ceasefire is supposed to create the climate for discussing these issues. Obviously, hard bargains will mark these negotiations. The agreement in Bangkok could be seen as a fresh beginning for such talks. But unless the political issues are addressed more seriously, the truce itself will be in danger. Both sides need to do more in order to make it a truce with a purpose.

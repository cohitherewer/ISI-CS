 INDUS IS NOT INDIA

 Different identity

 The Indus Saga: From Pataliputra to Partition By Aitzaz Ahsan, Roli, Rs 495

 The author, Aitzaz Ahsan, is the founder-president of the human rights commission of Pakistan and a senior advocate in the country?s supreme court. He was incarcerated when his country was ruled by a military government. This book, like Jawaharlal Nehru?s Discovery of India, was written in prison. Shashi Tharoor, in a recent book, prefers to call Nehru?s ?discovery? an ?invention?. Ahsan?s study of the Indus culture can be termed as an ?invention? too. The insights provided by Ahsan are truly innovative and, according to Khushwant Singh, ?provocative?. But, at times, Ahsan?s book becomes monotonous and it includes strands of analysis that are incongruous. 

 The alliterative subtitle, ?From Pataliputra to Partition?, is misleading. The author delves into the pre-history of the Indus at a time when neither Pataliputra nor any of its sixteen mahajanapadas existed. The history of the Indus, which goes back to nearly five thousand years, is what Ahsan attempts to study. His project approximates the Braudelian concept of la longue dur?e. But the tools used by Ahsan are ill equipped to reveal the diversity of Fernand Braudel?s historical structures. Even Lucian Febvre?s analysis of the three fundamental ingredients of historical causality ? contingency, necessity and idea ? which inspired Braudel, finds little application in Ahsan?s study. Ahsan unwittingly gets trapped in the notion of ?linearity? of time which denies his study depth and versatility.

 Ahsan?s contention is that Indus and India represent two distinctively different civilizations. An ?unobtrusive strip of land?, which Ahsan calls the ?Gurdaspur-Kathiawar salient?, separates the Indus from the Ganges. Ahsan dismisses Nehru?s emphasis on the ?oneness? of sub-continental history. Yet, he also repudiates the ?fragility syndrome? of Pakistanis who, in order to stress their unIndianness, assert some fanciful affinity with the Arab world. Ahsan argues that since ?the Indus has been relatively closer to the areas of the Oxus (Amu Darya) and the Jaxartes (Syr Darya) than to any other plains, river systems, peninsula or desert region, whether Indian or Arab?, the roots of the Indus civilization should be traced to central Asia or Persia. 

 Ahsan depends entirely on the Kosambian method of ?examining the successive charges in the means and relations of production? to delineate the emergence of the three universal states in the Indus, and also its journey from feudalism to capitalism. But this approach achieves moderate success as it fails to link the different perspectives to a single historical event. For example, when Ahsan postulates that Jinnah?s demand for a separate Muslim state was a result of the clash of interest between the Hindu and the Muslim bourgeoisie, he seems to be upholding his own perception of a ?different? Indus culture as a supportive base for Jinnah?s demand. But he fails to recognize the difference in the idea of difference itself which sets Jinnah apart from Ahsan himself.

 Again, how relations of production relation could possibly enable sufi and bhakti saints to fuse two fundamentally irreconcilable cultures is a question which the author chooses to leave unanswered. Ahsan makes very little effort to understand and explore several other similar ?inventions? preceding his. The author?s avowed project of ?demystifying? history ironically historicizes some of his own myths while rejecting others.

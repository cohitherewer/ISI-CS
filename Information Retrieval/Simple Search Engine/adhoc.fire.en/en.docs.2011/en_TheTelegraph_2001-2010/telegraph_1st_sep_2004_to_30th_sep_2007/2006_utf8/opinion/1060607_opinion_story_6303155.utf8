The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 For the sake of peace 

Aditi Bhaduri

The news that the ?Quartet? is planning to send financial 

aid to Palestine has reached Gaza but few are rejoicing or hoping for better times. 

Many promises have been heard in Gaza and hope is a word long lost there. But, 

even in a hope-less land, loyalty to the Hamas runs deep. The more the United 

States of America and Israel refuse to recognize Hamas as legitimate representatives 

of the Palestinian people, the more determined it makes Palestinians to support 

them. 

That the Hamas would win the elections was fairly 

evident. Even the Palestinian Authority knew this, so unpopular had the rule of 

the ?Abus? become by then. Therefore, it seems odd that analysts at Washington 

and Israeli intelligence had not foreseen the Hamas?s spectacular triumph in the 

polls. Or was there some intent in this ? of bringing the on-going negotiations 

to a grinding halt? 

Returning to the West Bank recently, I was surprised 

to find that life had become more sullen, much more than what it had been even 

during the days of the al-Aqsa intifada. To get to Hebron from Jerusalem, 

a mere 20-km drive, now you have to change transport thrice. The city seems to 

be a skeleton of its former self. The old quarters of the city seem to be dead. 

All the shops have closed down and families have moved out of their houses fearing 

violence. 

Now that the Hamas has been given a mandate by the 

Palestinian people, it needs to be engaged politically by both the Palestine Liberation 

Organization and Israel. Otherwise, the situation on the ground may turn worse. 

In fact, many Israelis, as well as members of the international community have 

proposed this idea as isolating the Hamas now will only add to its popularity. 

Responsibility, they argue, may even change the nature of the organization. 

In the wrong 

In fact, the Hamas will not have any option but to 

moderate its stand now ? both the economy and international opinion demand it. 

Arab states are uncomfortable with the rise of Hamas to power while Hamas cannot 

afford to lose Arab money. But Israeli intransigency is stoking radicalism in 

the Hamas?s ranks. Moreover, Israel is also withholding money that actually belongs 

to Palestinians. The money that Israel refuses to transfer into the hands of the 

Palestinian Authority are taxes that it collected on behalf of Palestinians. Under 

the terms of the Paris Protocol, Israel is supposed to transfer the funds to Palestine. 

Even if the Hamas is forced to renounce power that 

it won democratically, the outfit will not go into hibernation. Its violence has 

been directed not only at Israel but also against the Fatah. A rejection will 

force them up the path of violence once more and their support amongst ordinary 

Palestinians is likely to increase further.

For its part, the Hamas has to keep in mind that its 

mandate comes from the Palestinian people. More importantly, they should also 

remember that power cannot be sustained on empty stomachs. Some countries had 

suspended aid operations to Palestine following Hamas?s victory in the elections. 

The Palestinian finance minister, Omar Abdel-Razeq, has admitted that his ministry 

could not pay salaries to public employees because of a widening international 

boycott of the Hamas-led government. The boycott was mainly due to Hamas?s refusal 

to recognize the state of Israel, renounce violence and honour all agreements 

signed between Israel and Palestine.

Hamas leaders should take a lesson from the Fatah?s 

loss of credibility. Palestine is on the brink of a civil war. There have been 

numerous clashes between loyalists belonging to the two factions in Palestine. 

Most Palestinians, the Hamas-led government should do well to remember,want their 

leaders to resume negotiations with Israel.

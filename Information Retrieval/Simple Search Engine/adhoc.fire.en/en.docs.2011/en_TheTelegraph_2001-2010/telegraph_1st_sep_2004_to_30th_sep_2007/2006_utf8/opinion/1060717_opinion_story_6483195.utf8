The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 MIDNIGHT KNOCK

 The idea is to prevent further acts of hate, not to sow the seeds of more hatred. A terrorist attack will naturally spark off a search for suspects, but the least that can be expected is a planned search. It is time to ask exactly what kind of a plan leads to midnight and early morning raids on settlements housing the poorest of the minority community, as is happening now in Mumbai. The indignity inflicted seems part of the plan too, because the technique is the same in each case: the barging into homes while families are asleep or barely awake, the dragging away of male members before their children, a release ? obviously with no apology ? hours later. That is, till the next time. Of the numerous questions the administration should be compelled to answer, this is one of the most important. The state is not only failing to protect its citizens, but it is also going as far as it can to alienate some of its most helpless members who are too vulnerable to object to anything. Simply by ?rounding up? hundreds of them immediately after a terrorist attack, the administration brands a particular community ? it allows itself to be perceived as suspicious of everyone in the community. It is almost as if the state feels the need to grow a larger number of extremists within the country.

 After a terrorist attack, the question of rights becomes confusing and reason grows muddled. The most confusing ? and confused ? signals, however, are emanating from the investigating agencies and politicians. But among the many clues and non-clues, the roads-not-taken and blind alleys that are being thrown haphazardly at a wondering nation, the reason for raids on the poor remains a dark secret. Yet all citizens have cause for concern that such raids would lead only to resentment and hurt precisely when goodwill is at a premium. Especially since investigators claim to have before them names and faces, suspicions and warnings from overseas agencies, indicating sophisticated communication and coordination dependent on expensive equipment. 

 There is an overt indecency in the Bharatiya Janata Party?s decision to send Mr Narendra Modi to Mumbai to lead the party?s campaign against terrorism. Mr Modi is associated with one of the most hideous episodes of violence against Muslims, if only by omission. To make him a leader in an anti-terror campaign is a ploy to link the killers to a whole community as well as to provide provocation for sectarian unrest. But is the administration under the United Progressive Alliance doing anything different? Sensitive times demand sensitive behaviour. Is it that poor people do not matter to any administration? Or are law-keepers trying to take out their failures on them? Perhaps policemen believe, in their sublime innocence, that bullying and hurting the weak will terrify the killers of the innocent.

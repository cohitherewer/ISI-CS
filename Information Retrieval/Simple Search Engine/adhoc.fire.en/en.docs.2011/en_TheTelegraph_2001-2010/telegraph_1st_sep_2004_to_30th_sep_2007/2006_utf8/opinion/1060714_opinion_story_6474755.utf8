The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 WAKE UP

 Pious platitudes can never compensate for the lack of effective action. The address to the nation by the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, one day after the blasts in Mumbai and Srinagar, contained all the expected and well-meant sentiments. But the prime minister?s statement failed to convince and to build confidence. It also left a trail of unanswered questions. Why didn?t Mr Singh go to Mumbai immediately? That was the least that was expected of him. He has since announced that he will be visiting Mumbai today, two days after the city returned to its normal life. The president of the Congress, Ms Sonia Gandhi, went to Mumbai with the home minister, Mr Shivraj Patil, in tow. But this is not the same as a visit from the prime minister. The distinction between the government and the party cannot be abandoned even in a crisis. Again, why did the prime minister wait for 24 hours before he addressed the nation? By the evening of Tuesday, the full scale of the horror was already known. The expectation was that the prime minister would speak to the nation immediately. Timing was of the essence, and the prime minister faltered here as he indeed has been doing in too many spheres of governance.

 The failure in governance is manifest in the manner terrorists so easily hit their targets in India. This can only be explained by the systemic failure of intelligence. Yet, to date, no action has been taken to make the various intelligence agencies more accountable to the prime minister. Mr Singh was quite right when he said in his address that ?this is not the first time that the enemies of our nation have tried to undermine our peace and prosperity?. The nation will look forward to the time when the prime minister is able to affirm that this is the last time that India?s enemies will try to erode its peace and prosperity. Till the prime minister can instil that confidence, anything he says will sound hollow and meaningless. Life in Mumbai has returned to normal not because of, but in spite of, what the government has done. The people of that city have no other choice but to go on with their lives. Many unrelated things are converging at the present moment to convey the impression that things are spinning out of control for the United Progressive Alliance. Mr Singh must appear to be a little more assertive and effective if he is to quell the impression.

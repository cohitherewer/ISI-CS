 FAST POLITICS

 Fasting in most religious traditions is a ritual act of atonement or purification. Christians fast during Lent and Muslims during Ramadan. Hindus fast before performing any religious ceremony to approach god in a state of ritual purity. Fasting was made to shift to the realm of the secular by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. He used the fast with devastating effect against the British government. This was his unique form of protest. A ritual act became in his hands an instrument of protest. A fast by Gandhi always embarrassed as it was indeed intended to the British government. The latter did not quite know how to cope with a fast by Gandhi. It is undeniable however this might go against nationalist sentiments that Gandhi used the fast as a form of political blackmail against his opponents. Or to put it more politely, a fast was a form of exerting pressure. He overlaid this with moral and religious concerns by using the rhetoric of the inner voice and atonement. What is equally important is that a fast took the politics of protest outside the purview of democratic discourse and practice. Under British rule, this displacement of the politics of protest had some justification since British rule in India was not democratic: most Indians had no access to democratic institutions.

 Once India was independent and a proud republic with universal adult suffrage, fast as a mode of protest lost its edge and relevance. The democratic institutions allowed enough scope and opportunity for the articulation of protest and dissent. Only those who did not believe in democracy and in the rule of law expressed their protest through non-democratic and violent means. The Maoists are a typical example. There are others, like Ms Medha Patkar, Ms Irom Sharmila and Mr Sunderlal Bahuguna, who do not belong to any political party but want to draw public attention to their cause and use the fast as a weapon against the state. It could be argued that they were forced to adopt this weapon as they have no representation in the established democratic institutions of the country.

 Ms Mamata Banerjee, whose fast against the acquisition of land in Singur enters its seventh day, can claim no such justification. She is the leader of a political party that is embedded in the democratic system. She has never, even in her rhetorical fury, expressed her lack of faith in democracy. Yet, she has chosen a form of protest that is fundamentally undemocratic. Moreover, before and during her fast, the chief minister of West Bengal has appealed to her to come to the negotiating table to discuss the Singur issue. She has spurned such offers and has opted to make a public spectacle of herself. Her fast, unlike those resorted to by Gandhi, has no moral overtones. It is no more than a piece of political blackmail.

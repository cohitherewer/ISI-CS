 VIRTUAL LIVES

 Like alcohol and glue, the internet can be dangerously addictive. As the proportion of heavy users more than eight hours per week grows in India from 20 to 38 per cent between 2004 and this year, it is time for Indians to sit up to the peculiar dangers of this revolutionary and extraordinarily facilitating medium. Although information technology has become, for India, the magic phrase for entry into globalized modernity, the aspect of the internet that has, so far, alarmed the Indian State, and provoked all sorts of kneejerk reactions, is the power of the internet to resist and elude censorship and control. Both security and morality have been the concern of the State. Terrorism and pornography both find their ideal medium in the internet, as does that other ungovernable phenomenon, democracy. But India has bothered strangely little about the internets ability to transform many of its users into dysfunctional human beings. 

 According to American surveys, the worst victims are comfortably-off, single, urban men in their thirties, who begin to prefer, for the greater part of their waking hours, the company of webgames, chatrooms and the like, to real people even when they happen to be their loved ones. This is considerably more than, say, modern Indias odious fascination with the mobile phone. Addiction to the net not only renders the addict socially and domestically absent, but it could also cause, like alcoholism and other forms of substance abuse, irreparable physical and psychological damage. It can profoundly alter the mind and bodys relationships with time or with other minds and bodies. Hence the irony of a universally connective medium producing islands of pathological non-communication in cyberjunkies who prefer pixels to people. A whole new form of awareness and therapy is required to deal with this syndrome in the context of Indian cities and towns. A conservative and unequal society still largely unwilling to respect the individuals privacy affords several excuses for escapism and mendacity. An escape from the pressures on ones professional, social or sexual identity, perhaps from identity itself, is often what an entry into the global might imply for many. Or, to virtually overcome the limits of ones actual existence to find a kind of freedom to refashion oneself and yet belong to other potentially unlimited communities. This is where the internet might offer its most compulsive pleasures.

 Letters to Editor

 Royally deluded

 Sir Yashodhara Raje Scindias recent unfair demand is the latest version of the Indian upper classs indulgence at the cost of the commoners self-esteem (Yes, Your Highness, Nov 5). Despite being stripped of their royalty, the erstwhile royals still live in a world of material and social opulence. One is reminded of how the maharajas loved elegant pastimes and spent lavishly on the riches of Europe. The end of the raj and six decades of independence should have eroded their prosperity and altered their mindset. But very few princely families managed to reconcile themselves to this loss. Therefore, the title Shrimant is a botched attempt by the government to pander to the self-delusion still characterising those who no longer find their blue blood of much use. Raje should learn a lesson or two from the Indian judiciarys attempt to do away with archaic terms of addresses in court.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir One fails to understand why such a hue and cry is being raised over the use of Shrimant to address Yashodhara Raje. This does not cost a penny to the exchequer. Incidentally, nobody raises an objection when Lalu Prasads followers call him the raja of Bihar. What then about most of the members of parliament and legislatures who live like maharajas at the cost of taxpayers? In India, members of various bodies and commissions set up by the government invariably prefer five-star comfort to the state guest-houses when they travel on official business. The government must formulate and implement strict policies so that such unproductive drain on the national exchequer is checked. In fact, as representatives of the people, MPs and MLAs should stay in sarais or dharamshalas for better interaction with the masses. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Sir Yashodhara Raje insists on being called Shrimant, and Jyotiraditya refers to the inhabitants of the erstwhile Scindia fief as his prajas. Some imperialisms benefit the citizens, while the extravagance of some others is at the cost of their subjects. A major reason behind Yashodhara Rajes anxiety could have been the fate of the Shah of Iran and the plight of the monarchy in Nepal.

 Yours faithfully,

Md. Aslam Parvez, Calcutta

 Murder down below

 Sir The spine-chilling news of the probable extinction of sea fauna by 2048 offers the only solace that at least some people know the problem and know it exactly (2048: Your last morsel of seafood, Nov 3). Such natural catastrophes can surely happen; how soon is what we need to know. Human greed is the major cause of devastation in the natural world. One can only wonder what the human race would do with all its material wealth once there is no food to buy. What would it do with political and military power when it would be meaningless to show off such might? The classic lack of logic in many human actions is exemplified by the way we kill caterpillars even though we love the sight of the butterfly. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Datta, Calcutta

 Sir With India accounting for 89,451 animal species or 7.31 per cent of the global fauna and 10.78 per cent of the flora, it cannot waste time to act on the threat to biodiversity. Indias water ecosystems are very rich in biodiversity. This also represents an enormous economic wealth. Indias marine species also need to be protected for genetic studies and environmental reclamations. Reckless human predators have ensured that, by the year 2025, the earth could lose as many as one-fifth of all species of animals existing today. India should not only guard its own endangered species against extinction but also revive and refurbish the natural habitats of our plant and animal kingdoms. We must try to ensure that man and beast continue to share the planet. Therefore, the suggestion of zoologists and biologists to reduce fisheries and set up marine reserves is the most viable solution at hand.

 Yours faithfully,

Tuli Das, Calcutta

 Inhuman

 Sir It is tragic that innocent people keep losing their lives because of the VIP syndrome (VIP twist to Puri temple stampede, Nov 5). What is it that prevents the VIPs from sharing the road with commoners? Taxpayers money goes to waste in making security arrangements for VIPs that serve no purpose other than helping them to show off and bully the people. Why can our politicians and bureaucrats not learn a few lessons from their Western counterparts who freely mix with the crowd and do not make a show of their status? It is time Indian VIPs shed their egos and learned to identify with their more plebeian brethren. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad 

 Sir The only way to cure the Indian breed of VIPs of their megalomania is to make them experience a stampede such as the one at the Jagannath temple. The unqualified callousness of Indian politicians and celebrities is baffling. Is it because of a lack of value-based education among our political and bureaucratic classes? Or is it simply the corrupting influence of power and money? 

 Yours faithfully,

Niladri Ghosh, Howrah

 GRIEF?S DEFEAT

 - Tagore?s late-born Mirabai

 Relationships By Rabindranath Tagore, Translated by Supriya Chaudhuri, Oxford, Rs 395

 Rabindranath Tagore?s Jogajog was published, in book-form, in 1929. This was the year Thomas Mann got the Nobel prize and Virginia Woolf?s A Room of One?s Own was published. While Tagore?s novel was being serialized in Bichitra ? between 1927 and ?29 ? Mann started working on Joseph and his Brothers, Woolf completed Orlando, and in 1928, Lady Chatterley?s Lover hit England. In 1927, while Proust was finishing In Search of Lost Time, Freud was discussing religion in The Future of an Illusion, Heisenberg the principle of uncertainty, and Duke Ellington improvising the ?Creole Love Song?; Civilization and its Discontents would come out a year after Jogajog, as would Auden?s Poems. Waste Land and Ulysses happened in 1922, and Magic Mountain completed in 1924, the year of Kafka?s death. In the mid-Twenties, Shostakovich, Stravinsky, Matisse, Picasso and the Surrealists were approaching the peak of their creativity. In the same year as Jogajog, Dali painted The Persistence of Memory, and the Museum of Modern Art opened in New York City. Then, in 1933, the year of Jung?s Modern Man in Search of a Soul, Hitler would declare himself Chancellor of Germany.

 This glimpse of a wider chronology is important if one is to restore to Tagore?s modernity, and his Modernism, their original places in history and in the world. This is surely one of the primary motivations behind Supriya Chaudhuri?s rendering of the novel into English, and her critical introduction to this translation, as indeed behind the entire ?Oxford Tagore Translations? series, of which this is the fifth volume. Translating Tagore into English is to open his genius out to a wider range of critical and historical approaches, reinstating the ?World-Poet? within a universe of literature and scholarship that is considerably larger than what most of his current venerators seem able to summon up.

 The reach of Tagore?s own creative and intellectual life seems to have achieved an extraordinary expansion during the Twenties. The evidence of this is not only in the drama, poetry, songs, fiction and essays of the period, in the evolution of Visva-Bharati, and in Tagore?s complex responses to nationalism, but also in his incessant and extensive travels in India and abroad throughout the decade: several times to England, Central and Eastern Europe, the United States and Japan, apart from visits to Canada, China, South-east Asia and Egypt. Significantly, Rabindranath?s eldest daughter, Madhurilata, died in 1918 in her early thirties, and in 1925, Jyotirindranath passed away, a brother twelve years his senior, with whose childless wife, Kadambari, Rabindranath had had a mysteriously intense and formative intimacy before she took her own life in 1884.

 Jogajog comes towards the end of this restlessly itinerant, death-touched decade. And in contrast to the avant-garde wit and cosmopolitanism of its twin, Shesher Kobita, it is a novel informed by what Chaudhuri calls a ?profound and irreducible sense of disillusion? that produces its own modes of discontinuity and unfinishedness. Tagore describes the trauma of writing this novel in terms of ?unbearable harm and self-degradation?, the loss of nothing less than the struggling writer?s ?self-respect?, who seems, at every stage of the writing, to have ?failed his own creation?. He ends up with a novel that explores only a fraction of its projected temporal span, and that too across a great and baffling gulf of time. Yet these failings are also what the novel is about. Its tragic sense of life is founded upon the failure of everything that is noble and passionate in the human imagination, because of both a ?fortuitous combination of circumstances?, and of something inherent in the imagination itself ? a capacity for self-deception and egotism, however unconscious and exalted, and a final, unutterable sense of emptiness, loss and ineffectuality (?the defeat of grief?, as Auden had once put it) that finds its only expressive correlative in the whimpering of a dog.

 Auden?s ambiguous phrase is Tagorean, for it talks of being defeated by grief, but also gestures towards the possibility of using that grief itself to rise above the experience of defeat, the defeating of grief ? a process that both Kumudini and her brother, Bipradas, would finely understand and wish to master. Chaudhuri reads this ?failure? at the heart of Jogajog in relation to Luk?cs?s beautiful formulation in Theory of the Novel of ?a strange and melancholy paradox? ? ?the moment of failure is the moment of value?. It is the perception of this ?value? that leads to the novel?s representational challenges and, crucially, to Kumudini?s sense of ?metaphysical privilege?, her quasi-mystical ?election into misery?.

 Tagore?s achievement in Jogajog is to present Kumudini?s ?canonization? as both a situation and a subjectivity ? a historically determined predicament, involving an entire network of intertwined lives across time, as well as a form of inwardness, singularly tragic and ultimately unknowable, that would create its own spaces and symbols, tangible and intangible, and its own modes of reticence and revelation. Moreover, by setting the novel in the 19th century, this selfhood is placed within a social history of women?s intimate lives, their rituals, gestures and structures of desiring and feeling, in relation to traditional feudal-patriarchal habits of proprietorship on the one hand, and to a more ?modern?, liberal reformist sensibility on the other, each of these given complex human embodiments that elude reductive moral or historical schemata.

 The mystical coordinates for Kumudini?s sexually-beleaguered subjectivity are provided by the songs and legend of Mirabai, making her a modern-day saint and martyr in much the same way that George Eliot?s Dorothea Brooke, with her ?passionate, ideal nature? and her ?ardently willing soul?, is a ?late-born? St Theresa in Middlemarch (1872). ?Many Theresas have been born,? writes George Eliot in the Prelude to her novel, ?who found for themselves no epic life wherein there was a constant unfolding of far-resonant action; perhaps only a life of mistakes, the offspring of a certain spiritual grandeur ill-matched with the meanness of opportunity; perhaps a tragic failure which found no sacred poet and sank unwept into oblivion?. Dorothea is most notably succeeded by James?s Isabel Archer in The Portrait of a Lady (1881, revised 1908), the ?nobility? of whose imagination pitches her into a horrific conjugal mistake, and from which it attempts to hang back: ?there was a last vague space it couldn?t cross ? a dusky, uncertain tract which looked ambiguous and even slightly treacherous, like a moorland seen in the winter twilight. But she was to cross it yet.?

 Eventually betrayed by her own body, this is the darkness that Kumudini?s imagination will have to traverse within the actual confines of her husband?s home. But by a narratorial sleight of hand, which is one of fiction?s most inspired ? and also most painful ? elisions, the novel, like her brother, must leave her to do it alone.

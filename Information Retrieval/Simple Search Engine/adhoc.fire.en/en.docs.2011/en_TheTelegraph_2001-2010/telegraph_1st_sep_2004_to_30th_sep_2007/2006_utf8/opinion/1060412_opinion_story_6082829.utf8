 Letters to Editor

 All in the mind

 Sir ? While some are genuinely committed to artistic liberty, people like M.F. Husain seek media attention through deviant behaviour (?Delhi knives out for Husain?, April 8). In 1975, he painted images of Durga that had striking resemblance to Indira Gandhi. These travelled the country during Emergency, and Husain became famous. His paintings list different types of deviant sexual behaviour like bestiality (bull copulating with Parvati or Durga in sexual union with a tiger), incest (nude Lakshmi on the head of Ganesh), voyeurism (Shankar on Shivaratri watching his wife copulating) or plain blasphemy (Sita sitting on the thigh of a naked Ravana). If portraying the Prophet in cartoons can cause a global backlash, Hindus have perfect reason to file criminal complaints against him for outraging their religious sentiments. Had he been a real iconoclast, he would have painted Prophet Mohammed too. Husain has not only hurt the sentiments of Hindus, but has broken all the norms of a civil and pluralist society. 

 Yours faithfully,

Chameli Pal, Batanagar

 Sir ? That the Union home ministry has asked the Intelligence Bureau to look into the M.F. Husain issue is disconcerting news. The move to prosecute Husain is quite obviously aimed at pleasing the self-styled Hindu outfits. History is replete with instances where different groups have impinged on artistic freedom to suit their whims. Husain?s controversial work celebrates the secular spirit of India. Whatever the Supreme Court ruling, the government is merely adding to the market value of the paintings, particularly outside the country.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? What compels M.F. Husain to envision Hindu gods and goddesses as his fetishes? Hasn?t he realized by now that playing with religious sentiments in the name of artistic expression is nothing short of playing with fire. Sadly, in our country we have different yardsticks by which to judge any one crisis. For how long are we going to dismiss or trivialize the protests against Husain as fundamentalist outbursts? Remember, Muslims in nearly all parts of the globe, protested against the caricatured images of the Prophet. Let us hope agitations against Husain are not portrayed in a bad light just because they are being staged by the majority community.

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad 

 Sir ? The reaction to some of M.F. Husain?s paintings was quite unnecessary. But the government?s endeavours to prosecute the famous painter defy logic. If Husain?s paintings are blasphemous, what about the Khajuraho and Konark temples which are full of semi-nude statues of gods and goddesses? It must be recognized that the painter has complete freedom to express his creative instincts and depict any subject in the manner he wishes to. By reacting to the paintings, the public and the government are doing exactly what Muslim fundamentalists had done in response to the depiction of the Prophet in some Western publications. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta 

 Sir ? There is a danger of more violent responses if M.F. Husain is brought to book for his vulgar portrayals of Hindu deities. He has exceeded all limits of decency and civility. While the law will take its course, the Central government should at least withdraw the Padma Shri, Padma Bhushan and Padmavibhushan conferred on Husain.

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind D. Tapkire, Mumbai 

 In all fairness

 Sir ? The recent hike in fees in the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, is completely justified (?IIM subsidy in Murthy glare? April 3). A previous report, ?B to C, IIM grads get a salary high? (March 13), mentioned that a student from IIM Bangalore had bagged a Rs 85 lakh per annum job and similar offers had flooded other IIM students. Considering their earnings after graduation, Rs. 1.77 lakh per year is not unreasonable at all, and it is far less than what private B-schools charge. 

 Yours faithfully,

Devashis Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? IIM Ahmedabad has increased its fees by 12 per cent after considering the rate of inflation and the cost provided for professional courses. However, the hike is less than 50 per cent of the cost per student borne by the institute per year. Students there also reportedly get additional subsidized education packages within the fee they pay for the course. All of which means that there is further scope for a fee hike.

 Yours faithfully,

Ashish Kumar Mohanty, Cuttack

 Sir ? The hike in the annual fee of the five IIMs was long overdue. It is proportionate to the amenities they equip their students with. In order to attract the best brains of the world, the institutes need to improve their faculties. Surely, IIM aspirants would not mind paying a few thousand rupees more for the quality of education.

 Yours faithfully,

Joyeeta Dey, Calcutta

 Errata

 Bibek Debroy (?Liberalizing agriculture?, April 11) is no longer director, Rajiv Gandhi Institute for Contemporary Studies, New Delhi. He is presently secretary-general, Peace Harmony Development, New Delhi. The error is regretted.

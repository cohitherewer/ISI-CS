The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 FALL BACK ON THE FOURTH ESTATE

 Beginner?s luck

 Increasingly, publishers tend to prefer first-time authors ? more so if they are young and telegenic ? because they find it easier to ?tease? the market with an untested commodity than risk money on those whose previous works may not have done well. Publishers have a monitoring system that is fine-tuned to tell them how well a previous book has done: the number of copies printed, the number sold over what period of time and how the bottom line looks after a year or so. More importantly, they know two other crucial factors: the author?s clout with the media and whether the book was largely sold to individuals across the cash counter or to institutions that would take their own time paying their bills and would not repeat their orders.

 What does this mean for full-time writers who live on earnings from their writings which are not supplemented by regular or part-time work? Does it mean the end of the road for them, especially if they are the middling kind which most of us are?

 A simple fact. All writers have begun their writing life as journalists and they have continued their journalistic writings even after they have become famous; some have branched off as scriptwriters for films and TV sitcoms, but journalism remains their bread-and-butter line. Authors have never relied on their books as a means of livelihood for two reasons. Given the vagaries of the market, they could never be sure how much they would earn from royalties at the end of the year; second, writing is a full-time job but every writer needs ?a break?, not merely to supplement the monthly budget, but to take some time off from the creative act which can be quite exhausting. 

 It isn?t necessary to get back to a full-time job now because developments in technology have led to a vast expansion and diversification of media outlets that have an inexhaustive appetite for raw material; discussions about books and writers, almost any kind of gossip is a cheap source of such material.

 If authors find it difficult to get their second and subsequent books published because of the failure of the first, there is a growing demand for shorter versions of their writings. It is easy to understand this paradox: the reader does not want more than 3000 words at a time. The publisher is happy to go along because smaller books do not require big investments. 

 An author?s second book may be rejected for any number of reasons that may have nothing to do with quality. Successful marketing, after all, depends on a collaboration between the writer, the publisher and the media. If the writer doesn?t satisfy the immediate needs of the publisher or the current interests of the media the book would be out. But that doesn?t mean that these writers are out in the cold.

 There is nothing that can be done about it, except to carry on and work out their creative impulses in journalism of one kind or another.

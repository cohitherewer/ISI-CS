 DIFFERENT CASE

 The stock market has rebounded sharply from its recent lows on the back of a resurgence of net inflows by foreign institutional investors, on the one hand, and buying by mutual funds on the other. Sentiment has also been boosted by better-than-expected corporate results for the first quarter of 2006-07. The question in the mind of every investor is whether the buoyancy will last. It is not only the Indian markets that have been rising other emerging markets too have gone up. As of August 15, the MSCI BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) index was up 5.3 per cent this quarter. Also, money has again started flowing into emerging market equity funds. Clearly, some of the fears that led to the market crash in mid-May have been alleviated. The biggest of these was that interest rates would rise globally as central banks started tightening money supply in an effort to contain rising inflation. Since then, the United States of America Federal Reserve has paused after a record run of 17 consecutive rate hikes. The pause comes after data showed that US gross domestic product growth slowed considerably in the June quarter. The Japanese central bank, which started removing excess liquidity from the Japanese markets, has also indicated that it is in no hurry to raise interest rates. This change in policy has been a boon for the markets.

 There are plenty of indications that US growth is slowing down. Inflationary pressures are tapering off while growth is braking. Simply put, the earlier series of US rate hikes is finally having an effect. To be sure, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England continue to raise rates, but a US slowdown will sooner or later affect their economies too. Many analysts also believe that emerging markets are closely correlated with US growth and any deceleration in the worlds primary engine of growth is likely to be negative for emerging markets. The uncertainty is reflected in the fact that the recent rise in emerging market indices has been accompanied by low volumes.

 However, unlike other Asian markets, Indian growth depends on the strength of its domestic consumption. If the RBI follows the Fed and pauses in raising interest rates further, domestic debt-fuelled consumption should continue. Investment demand continues to be very strong. India is different from other emerging markets. The problem is, most foreign investors have usually lumped emerging markets together, although there are some initial signs of change the MSCI BRIC index has handsomely outperformed the MSCI Emerging Markets index, reflecting the bigger opportunity in the BRIC countries. The next few months will show whether the Indian market can successfully decouple from the emerging market herd and reflect its long-term potential.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 PASSED BY

 One measure of a government?s strength is how it is perceived at home and abroad. By this yardstick Mr Manmohan Singh?s government scores rather poorly. Within India it is seen as a government that does not know its own mind and is incapable of standing by its own decisions. This perception is only partially related to the fact that the government is a coalition one and thus open to various kinds of pressures from the coalition partners. A large part of the perception actually grows from the fact that the prime minister is seen as someone who does not assert himself in spite of the respect and the dignity he commands. He is seen as a soft prime minister who does not push through his views. The perception is no different abroad. Despite the respect that he receives in Washington and in other important capitals of the world, when it comes to an impending international crisis, the world tends to ignore India and its government. Witness India?s isolation as events in west Asia hurtle towards a major confrontation. In the past, whenever the world faced a crisis like the one looming over west Asia, special envoys from key governments would rush to New Delhi to consult the Indian government and sometimes even to seek its intervention. This time such visits and appeals for assistance have been conspicuous by their absence.

 The reasons for this neglect are not difficult to locate. The government of India does not have a full-time foreign minister. The prime minister holds the portfolio as he holds many others. In the prime minister?s office, there is nobody who is a specialist in foreign affairs. The foreign secretary, unfortunately, is in limbo at the present juncture, because he is due to retire in September. This is a bizarre situation because at the policy level nobody is devoting his full attention to foreign affairs. The implications of this situation have not escaped leaders and mandarins in the important capitals of the world. The prime minister?s foreign policy initiatives seem to be focussed on the Indo-US nuclear deal. In St Petersburg, at the meeting of the G-8, he earned a few points on the battle against terrorism. But this was fortuitous. The blasts in Mumbai took place a few days before the meeting, thus providing the prime minister with an agenda. Without the Mumbai blasts India may have been reduced to the position of a mere spectator. Both the prime minister and his government need to grow into their statures.

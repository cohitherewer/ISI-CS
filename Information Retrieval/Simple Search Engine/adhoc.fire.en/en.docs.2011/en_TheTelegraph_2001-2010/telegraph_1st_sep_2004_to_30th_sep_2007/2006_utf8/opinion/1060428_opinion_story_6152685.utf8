 ALL WEATHER FRIENDS

 High anxiety

 WEATHER AND WARFARE By Ajey Lele, Lancer, Rs 595

 Whether it was Attila?s cavalry in front of Rome during the summer of 452 AD or Hitler?s panzers in front of Moscow during the winter of 1941, weather played a crucial role in undermining the effectiveness of the armies of these two warlords. Even in the age of the so called revolution in military affairs, high grade killing machines remain vulnerable to weather. In this monograph, Ajey Lele attempts to evaluate the probable effects of climate on new combat technologies which the armed forces of the big powers are acquiring.

 The core of RMA consists of the use of the latest sensory and electro-optical systems for raising battlefield reconnaissance, target acquisition and destruction capabilities of the militaries. However, the performance of these systems depend to a large extent on the level of atmospheric moisture content, fluctuating temperature, fog, dust and so on.

 Temperature gradients inside the oceans affect the performance of sonar. Occasional geomagnetic storms disturb the global positioning systems? signals. Air pressure affects gunnery computations and ballistic performance. Air reconnaissance, aerial transport operations and para drops depend to a large extent on the visibility, cloud cover and precipitation. The unmanned aerial vehicles and thermal vision devices are more effective in cold, snowy climate rather than in regions with high temperature. This is because in lower temperatures, such devices could actually register far higher heat contrast between the surrounding medium and the target emitting heat waves. Cloud cover also obstructs laser guidance for bombs dropped by the aircraft.

 The two Gulf wars and the air war in Kosovo in 1999 witnessed the use of RMA technologies. The optical and infra-red sensors of the Nato aircraft failed due to bad weather. Lele tells us that occasionally, the weather over Iraq adversely affected US military operations. Not Saddam Hussein?s elite republican guards but the violent desert sandstorms at times stopped the American blitzkrieg in central Iraq. The rough sand choked weapons, helicopter engines and computers. The khamsin (desert storm) in Cyrenaica frequently stalled Rommel?s panzer thrusts also.

 Climate is a pattern of weather conditions spread over a considerable period of time, and it exhibits non-linear tendencies. But that does not mean that as far as climatic changes are concerned, there is always chaos in the armed forces. Emergence of new gadgets can allow the military to take advantage of the fluctuating weather. Meteorological satellites provide photographs of the cloud cover which are essential to the latest fighters. The increasing availability of sub-metric resolution satellite data enables the meteorologists to understand the changing weather pattern over the probable combat zone.

 Lele rightly says that the Indian armed forces should prepare themselves to fight the weather as well because they operate in regions with wide temperature variations. While in Siachen the temperature drops to minus 70 degrees Centigrade, in the deserts of Rajasthan, where the Indian army is supposed to operate, the temperature reaches 50 degrees Centigrade.

 Lele?s account at times is incoherent and his organization of chapters (which he claims to be thematic) is a bit confusing. For a general reader, the monograph appears to be too technical. Nevertheless, Lele has touched upon an important subject. As far as Indian strategic study is concerned, his book seems to be the first of its kind.

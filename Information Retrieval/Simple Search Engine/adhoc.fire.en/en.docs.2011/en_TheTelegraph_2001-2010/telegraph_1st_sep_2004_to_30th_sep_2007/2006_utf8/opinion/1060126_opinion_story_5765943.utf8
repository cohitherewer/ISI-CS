 MAN AND ISSUES

 Personalities, especially those that bear the Gandhi-Nehru legacy, have an unending fascination for most Indians, especially to those belonging to the fourth estate. As a result, attention, in the just-concluded plenary session of the Congress, was focussed on Mr Rahul Gandhi. From reports emanating from Hyderabad, it would seem that the most important question before the Congress was whether Mr Gandhi should assume an important office in the party. Mr Gandhi, despite the clamour in his favour, politely declined to accept any office. In all humility, he told Congressmen that he would accept a post only when he deserved one and had worked for one. Like his mother, Mr Gandhi demonstrated that he has no craving for power, and that he was not in politics for the lures of office. Mr Gandhi thus followed a familiar script. But this non-event took the limelight away from some critical decisions that were taken during the plenary session.

 One of the subjects that were discussed in the plenary session was the issue of reservation in the private sector. This has an obvious populist appeal, and it has the support of the left, the Congress?s valued ally in the United Progressive Alliance. But the Congress did not put this matter on the top of its political and ideological agenda. The resolution asked the government to evolve legislative and administrative support for implementing affirmative action. In other words, the plenary session approached the issue in superficial terms without entering into the specific and thorny question of reservation in the private sector. This absence of enthusiasm was in sharp contrast to the party?s position on opening up of the retail trade. The direction of the economic resolution was evident from the government?s announcement permitting foreign direct investment in the retail sector. This will provide a boost to the process of liberalization. This step taken, while attention was focussed on Mr Gandhi, will instill confidence in the reform process. Taken together, these two aspects of the plenary session reveal that the Congress is not as driven by populism as it was in the past. They also go to demonstrate that the Congress and the government are not as alarmed by the left?s rhetoric as is often believed. The Congress may not have completely surrendered its baggage of socialism and populism. But its concerns have changed.

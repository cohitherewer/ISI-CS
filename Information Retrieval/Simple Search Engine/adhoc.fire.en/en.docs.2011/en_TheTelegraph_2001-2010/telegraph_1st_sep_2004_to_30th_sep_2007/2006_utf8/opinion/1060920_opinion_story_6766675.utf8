 FREE TO EXPLORE

 The term, new exploration licensing policy, is getting incongruous. It is pretty old, being in its sixth round this year, and it is hardly a policy; it is just an auction of blocks of land or sea for oil exploration. But for all its inaccuracy, it is growing in popularity. This time, the petroleum ministry has received 165 bids for 55 blocks; against 69 bids for 20 blocks last year. The ministry has some reason to congratulate itself. Just what for is a bit unclear. Mr V.K. Sibal, director general of Hydrocarbons, who plays a crucial role in the auction, thought it was Indias political stability. He ignored the stability of a certain arbitrariness in Indias policies. In the past two years, for instance, it has made its oil companies give such huge consumer subsidies that the profits of its refining companies are pitiably shrunk, and even the finances of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, its lucrative oil-producing company, have begun to look shaky. The government has refused to give the same subsidies to consumers of private companies; Reliance, as a result, has lost so many customers that it is contemplating converting its oil pumps into shops for something else. 

 Shareholders who had reposed confidence in the government oil companies have eroded their investments; they will think twice before investing again in government companies or companies which compete with them. Bidders for exploration licences have to promise the government a certain share of any oil they may produce, and to sell the rest within India until it comes to produce all the oil it consumes which is unlikely in the foreseeable future. They may watch the plight of Reliance which, after having found huge gas deposits off the east coast, can find no one in India who would pay a decent price, and is consequently just sitting on its reserves. Bidders may think that production of any oil they may find is a decade away, by which time there would be another government and other policies. But that is placing hope above realism.

 As last year, the highest number of bids has come from ONGC, our biggest oil producer, and Reliance, which would like to be it. Both have won most of the licences in recent years. This would have discouraged other bidders. There have, in fact, been few bids from international oil companies. Most other bids have come from small companies, including some which seem to have been cobbled together just for this auction. Joshi Technologies, Tap Oil and Adani Port Infrastructure, for instance, would not count amongst the worlds famous oil companies. This is a time of high oil prices and overflowing corporate treasuries. It is a time when corporates are short of investment opportunities and are prepared to take a long bet. That is what the heightened interest in the exploration blocks reflects.

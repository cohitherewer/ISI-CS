 INVITATION TO PEACE

 Manmohan Singh triumphed in Cuba by putting the India-Pakistan dialogue back on track, writes Jyoti Malhotra

 Going the Punjabi way

 The roller-coaster that constitutes the India-Pakistan relationship goes up one year and comes down the next. The first time Manmohan Singh and Pervez Musharraf met in New York in September 2004, they exchanged warm smiles and tall promises. Musharraf even pulled out a report card from the village school in Gah, where the young Singh had studied, to the amusement of those present. 

 In New York, after all the laughter and the PR, the two sat absolutely alone, talking for a whole hour in the Roosevelt Hotel, as their closest aides fidgeted in cushioned chairs outside. This motley group from India and Pakistan included sundry national security advisers and foreign ministers. On a couple of occasions during that one hour, they tried to send in waiters to ask if Singh-Musharraf needed anything. The then national security adviser, J.N. Dixit, stalled the not-so-benign waiters movements. Dixit, also the back-channel in the talks with his counterpart, Tariq Aziz, knew exactly what he was doing. Save for Aziz, no one else did. At the end of the hour, when Singh-Musharraf called their aides back into the room, the Indian prime minister pulled out a piece of paper from his pocket and said that he and Musharraf had decided on the course of things to come. 

 That piece of paper had actually been agreed to only a few days before in a meeting in Dubai between Dixit and Aziz. India would agree to a one-on-one meeting without aides, said the agreement, if Musharraf refrained from criticizing India when he spoke at the United Nations general assembly. 

 That is exactly what happened. In contrast to the previous year, when he had spewed fire and brimstone and raised Kashmir at the general assembly, the Pakistani president settled for a few sweet-nothings about India. He got his exclusive bilateral with Manmohan Singh. It was at this meeting that both leaders not only decided that terrorism would be squarely addressed, but also that the Line of Control in Kashmir would be so dramatically transformed that it would, one day, disappear. 

 In a sense, the thaw in Cuba is a return to the warmth of 2004. But this is a qualitatively different warmth. Because this is a different Manmohan Singh, one who looks like he has decided to believe in himself. The good doctor has, for the past two years, voluntarily limited his passion to foreign direct investment and GDP growth, and on quietly insisting that, Its the economy, stupid ! 

 In the last few months though, as he has discovered that the space in the prime ministers chair allows him, Manmohan Singh has been tempted to assert himself. Just as he insisted in parliament that he would not allow the United States of America to shift the goalposts on the nuclear deal with India, the prime minister in Cuba had made up his mind to create space in the watertight dialogue with Pakistan. Even two months ago, it had not been that way. After the Mumbai blasts, he allowed his aides to postpone the foreign secretary-level talks with Pakistan, even though his first instinct had been against it. In fact, he had said, the foreign secretary-level talks should be used to discuss threadbare terrorism, and thereby the Mumbai blasts. 

 But with nearly 200 people dead and another 800 wounded, even the prime minister realized that his desire to keep the talks pot-boiling with Pakistan was misplaced. That is when the accusations that Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence was the mastermind and the Lashkar-e-Toiba the terrorist group responsible for the blasts began to be made public by his own government. But with no conclusive evidence two months down the line, and the trail threatening to grow cold, Manmohan Singh decided it was time once again to explore the peace option. 

 The back-channel, now between Satinder Lambah and Tariq Aziz, was activated. India would offer a counter-terrorism dialogue, and both sides would agree to take this discussion to a new level that is, beyond the discussion on terrorism, which was already part of the foreign secretary mandate. 

 The script in Cuba played exactly to plan. So much so that Indian officials are already saying that they will raise the return of Dawood Ibrahim as part of this dialogue. Meanwhile, so as not to demonize Pakistan, New Delhi has accepted that Pakistan is as much a victim of terrorism as India. In return, Pakistan will offer cooperation and help, from Mumbai to Benaras. 

 Perhaps, Cuba was responsible for the coming out of Manmohan Singh. Two years ago, his erstwhile national security adviser, J.N. Dixit, had helped him hold the score with his soft streak. This time around, he knew that if he had to rescue the dialogue from the hardliners at home, within the establishment as well as in the political opposition, he needed Musharraf on board. What better way than to speak to each other alone, for at least 45 minutes? 

 Last year, New York had been so different. Twenty-four hours before the meeting, Musharrafs aides, including the Pakistani ambassador to the US, Jehangir Karamat, had effectively sabotaged the bilateral by announcing that Pakistans condition in the dialogue process was for India to cut troops in Baramullah and Kupwara. 

 The Indian side had been furious. Both sides knew that the references to the two towns had been deliberate, as if to rub salt on Indian wounds. Moreover, these were the only two Kashmiri towns on the LoC and small wonder they were wracked by militancy. The meeting was a disaster even before it had started. 

 The prime minister now returns from Cuba having killed two birds with one stone. First, he has effectively catharsized the non-aligned movements hypocrisy of demonizing the US. And second, he has got himself an invitation from Musharraf again to visit Pakistan. 

 Truth is, Manmohan Singh wants to go home. He has lived all his adult life in India, but he came to this country as a young man, a refugee, from Pakistan during Partition, and something draws him there. It is an emotional tie, this Punjabiyat, which is capable of both destroying and healing. Singh believes that if he can hold his counterpart to the resolve of fighting terror jointly, then the co-Punjabi feeling can help Indias cause. 

 Singh believes that it can also provide the key to unlocking the Kashmir tangle. The point is that Kashmir was not the root cause of Partition. Not one person died in Kashmir in 1947, that only came later. It was the killing fields of Punjab that sowed the seeds of hatred and prejudice for generations to come. 

 The time is now ripe for Punjab, via Cuba, to show the way.

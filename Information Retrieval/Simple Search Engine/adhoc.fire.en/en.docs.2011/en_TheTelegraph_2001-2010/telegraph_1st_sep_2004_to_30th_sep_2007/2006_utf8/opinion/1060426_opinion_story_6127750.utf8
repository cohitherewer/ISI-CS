 IN THE EYE 

 OF THE STORM 

 J. Jayalalithaa?s choice of allies 

 may help her party win a closely fought election in Tamil 

 Nadu, writes Mahesh Rangarajan 

 Sign of the future 

 No state in India has been quite 

 the graveyard of confident predictions of psephologists 

 and political commentators as Tamil Nadu. Time and time 

 again, the voters in this vast province, dominated by not 

 one but two regional nationalist formations, have upset 

 the apple cart of the ruling party and the opposition formation 

 alike. 

 Just two years ago, a tidal wave 

 swept J. Jayalalithaa?s party off the electoral map during 

 the general elections. Her strident attacks on ?Sonia Maino? 

 fell flat. More seriously, the government employees rebelled 

 against her, alienated as they were by her action to break 

 their strike only the year before the general elections. 

 This proved critical as Tamil Nadu has the highest per capita 

 ratio of government employees in India and they are a highly 

 unionized work force. It includes school teachers and nurses, 

 farm extension workers and day care centre workers.

 The last minute tie-up with the 

 Bharatiya Janata Party proved to be a non-starter, alienating 

 the sizable religious minorities against her in a state 

 where Christians and Muslims together make up 11 per cent 

 of the electorate. To add to this, the Dravidian ideologues 

 were railing against her, following the enactment of measures 

 to block religious conversion and the ban on animal sacrifice 

 in temples. It is an amazing turnaround; one rarely seen 

 in recent times but the present election is poised at knife-edge. 

 The Centre for the Study of Developing Societies survey 

 went so far as to say that the polls in the state are ?too 

 close to call?. Despite a slender lead of two per cent in 

 the vote share of the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra 

 Kazhagam- led alliance, the result could tilt either way. 

 Irrespective of whether she loses or wins, the chief minister 

 has made this a battle worth watching. Placed in perspective, 

 she has converted a huge vote deficit of 2004 into a minor 

 surplus. If this trend continues, she might even look forward 

 to a simple majority for her own party with no crutches 

 from her allies.

 There have been similar contrasts 

 in recent years between Lok Sabha verdicts and state assembly 

 elections. In 1998, Digvijay Singh in Madhya Pradesh led 

 the Congress to a second term in office though his party 

 lost the subsequent Lok Sabha elections in the state. Lalu 

 Prasad and his wife performed a similar feat in Bihar in 

 2000 a little less than a year after the general elections.

 But there are two crucial differences 

 in Tamil Nadu. One is a generational issue. This is almost 

 certainly the last time M. Karunanidhi will lead the Dravida 

 Munnetra Kazhagam, a party he has been a member of since 

 its foundation in 1949, to battle. This may well prove to 

 be his Achilles heel: his heir apparent and son, M.K. Stalin, 

 lacks popular acceptance. This has forced the veteran to 

 clarify publicly that he will be chief minister after his 

 party wins at the hustings.

 The other has been a significant 

 feature of the Tamil Nadu polity for the last two years. 

 Jayalalithaa has crafted her policies to defuse disaffection 

 among the very sections that bolted from her party in 2004. 

 The arrest of the sankaracharya of Kanchi was well 

 publicized to reaffirm the belief that religious leaders 

 were not above the law. Less publicity was given to rescinding 

 the law on conversions, or to the expansion of the free 

 meal scheme in temples to churches and dargahs. There 

 was also a rapprochement with the powerful government employees? 

 unions.

 The turning point came with the 

 tsunami in December of 2004. Contrary to knee-jerk press 

 reports specifically in the audio-visual media at the time, 

 the state government handled itself with considerable alacrity 

 and speed. A similar drill was in place during the floods 

 the following year. Jayalalithaa?s opposition to the Sethusamudram 

 project taps into genuine fears of the fisher folk about 

 their livelihoods.

 Jayalalithaa?s other masterstroke 

 was the timing of the bicycle gifted to high school girl 

 students. In her first hundred days in office, in 2002, 

 she announced a programme to give a cycle to every Dalit 

 girl. Two years ago, this was extended to all girl students 

 in Class XI and XII. It is important to note that these 

 students will comprise a significant chunk of first generation 

 voters now that voting begins at the age of eighteen. 

 This is also perhaps the first 

 time in many years that a chief minister is campaigning 

 by highlighting her performance. The opposition is anxious 

 enough to promise free colour television sets and rice at 

 two rupees a kilogram to the poor. To be sure, the DMK has 

 a formidable lineup of allies and is fighting hard. Its 

 main bastions lie in north Tamil Nadu where its ally, the 

 Pattali Makkal Katchi, is also strong. Further sources of 

 support include the left and the Congress. Both are localized 

 but in this contest every seat and vote will count.

 History is testament that the 

 incumbent usually loses power in Fort St George. In recent 

 times, only the late M.G. Ramachandran managed the feat 

 of never losing a single assembly poll. Yet the legacy of 

 the past weighs equally heavily on the DMK. When E.V. Ramaswami 

 Naicker announced that he was marrying in order to beget 

 an heir, C.N. Annadurai founded the DMK as a revolt against 

 the idea that power flowed through lineage. It is ironical 

 that Karunanidhi?s own party now has a line of succession 

 that runs from father to son.

 It is here that the chief minister?s 

 choice of allies shows a shrewd political mind. V. Gopalsami 

 or Vaiko left the parent party in 1994 protesting against 

 dynastic politics. He retains a thin layer of supporters 

 across the state. Equally crucial are the Dalit Panthers, 

 a militant party led by T. Thirumavalavan. This is the first 

 time that a Dalit party has such a prominent role in a larger 

 alliance. Both parties compete with specially tailored welfare 

 measures for the poor and have their own blend of growth 

 and welfare. 

 The choice is still a very important 

 one. Five more years of the AIADMK will mean continuity, 

 and this will shake up the UPA coalition. Karunanidhi is 

 banking on the arithmetic of alliances to bring him back 

 to power one last time. Its maths versus performance. 

 This election looks like a cliffhanger though a come back 

 for the ruling party may well be on the cards.

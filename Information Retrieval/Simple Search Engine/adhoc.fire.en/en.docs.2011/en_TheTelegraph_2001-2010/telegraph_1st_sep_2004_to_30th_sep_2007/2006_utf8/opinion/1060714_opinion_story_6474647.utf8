 WORST ENEMIES

 Smart politicians do not baulk at crises; they survive ? and even thrive ? by manipulating them. But this is hardly an effective way to run a government. His skills in managing crises have not saved Jharkhand?s chief minister, Mr Arjun Munda, from landing his government in a mess. He leads a coalition that has a wafer-thin majority in the state assembly. The threats to his government, though, have not come as much from his enemies in the opposition as from his allies. The five ministers who recently threatened to quit the government and thereby reduce it to a minority may not immediately do so. But the threat and the circumstances leading to it have done enough damage to the government?s credibility. Things must be strange for a ruling coalition when the speaker of the assembly accuses the home minister of ?harbouring criminals?. Even if the allegation is not wholly true, it exposes the lack of mutual trust and the acrimony between the coalition partners. It would be unrealistic to expect such a government to perform. Even Mr Munda?s own Bharatiya Janata Party can no longer pretend that all is well with his government. The party?s decision to set up a committee to monitor Mr Munda?s work should have come earlier. 

 Yet, the larger issue is not about the survival of Mr Munda?s government. These should be exciting times for the new state?s economic prospects. It has a number of proposals for new industries, especially in steel and mining. Potential investors include some of the biggest names in these industries. Jharkhand?s iron-ore reserves make it one of the most coveted destinations for investors in these times of a liberalized mining policy. Mr Munda could actually be sitting pretty over this spate of investment proposals. Instead, he presides over an inept government, whose ministers delight in abusing each other. That this is of no great help to the investors was made clear by Mr L.N. Mittal, who recently expressed his ?disappointment? with the government?s work and threatened to shift his proposed steel project in Jharkhand to Orissa. Other investors could take Mr Mittal?s cue if the situation does not improve. That, of course, would be a great betrayal. It is now one of the poorest states. The Maoist threat it faces is mainly due to its extreme poverty. But then, Jharkhand?s politicians may prove to be the worst enemies of its economic promise.

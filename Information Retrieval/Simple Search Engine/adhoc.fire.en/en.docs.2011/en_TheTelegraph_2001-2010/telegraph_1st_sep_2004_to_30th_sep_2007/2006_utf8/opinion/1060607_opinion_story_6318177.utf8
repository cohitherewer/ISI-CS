 WHAT LIES HIDDEN IN THE FOOTNOTES OF THE PAST 

Tapan Raychaudhuri considers ways in which a 

legacy of mutual ill will can be transformed through honesty, memory and good 

sense

 The author is former professor of modern Indian history 

at the University of Oxford 

 A way forward 

Seeds of violence and mutual ill-will once sown are 

not easily eradicated. After the partition, the conflict of material interests 

which fed the fire was no longer there in India. In East Pakistan, getting rid 

of Hindus might have proved to be profitable as their lands and other assets went 

to the Muslim neighbours. Similar incentives appear to have been absent in India 

outside Punjab, but as events in recent years have shown, there was no lack of 

ill will and it could be easily churned up to lethal purpose. Elements in the 

majority community, the ?have nots? among the ?haves? in terms of access to education, 

power, status and material well-being, projected a xenophobic ideology which saw 

the Muslims as a pampered vote-bank. These projections ignored such startling 

facts as that the Muslims had hardly any access to opportunity: some 13 per cent 

of the population, they accounted for less than one per cent of pupils even in 

secondary schools. The position is much worse in jobs, professions and universities. 

Some pampered community! The other side of this ideology was an undefined Hindutva, 

which gloried in destroying mosques and killing Muslims. Persistent organizational 

effort, funded by NRIs and others, have turned this politics of hatred into a 

major plank in India?s public life.

The poison will not be eradicated in a day and the 

threat it poses to our civil life should never be underestimated. It has to be 

fought at many levels. First, all must realize that the days of single party rule 

are over and that communal hatred is the greatest danger facing our polity. Political 

parties need to give top priority to fighting it, to exposing its nature and projecting 

its obscenity relentlessly and without cease. Here, I feel, the vocabulary of 

our political discourse has to be modified. The sangh parivar are not Hindu 

nationalists, for nationalists do not usually arrange pogroms or condone them. 

Nor are they fundamentalists, for nothing fundamental to Hindu belief or practice 

informs their ideology. Only one expression describes them; xenophobic fascists. 

In fact, in the light of their words and conduct, all decent Hindus should question 

their right to call themselves Hindu. They have brought shame on us. In a properly 

ordered society, such people would have been expelled from the community. I have 

deliberately used very strong language in this paragraph. I have done so in the 

belief that movements based on strong negative emotions cannot be fought in the 

polite language of rational discourse. Our propaganda against projects of communal 

hatred must express our sense of total revulsion: we must try and implant that 

revulsion into the psyche of all sane Indians. Fortunately, the words and actions 

of the parivar are of great help in this matter. Theirs is not a language of civilized 

discourse.

In pre-British days, when the state did not honour 

our great men, people devised titles to show their high regard. Mahatma, Lokmanya, 

Deshbandhu, Netaji and so on. Since the state machinery is not about to punish 

the likes of Modi, Togadia or Advani, using appropriate labels to describe them 

might help consolidate and project our sense of disgust. I suggest naradham 

for Modi, and kumbhirasru for Advani as a start. Remember Advani?s copious 

tears over Ayodhya! What crocodile could beat this old hypocrite, master manipulator 

of communal hatred?

Hatred of a community is not simply a political phenomenon; 

it strikes deep roots in the culture and psyche of a people. The experience of 

anti-semitism in Europe provides ample evidence to prove this point. And when 

I heard from a highly educated Bengali that the Gujarat pogrom had become a necessity, 

I realized that something has gone very seriously wrong with our social culture. 

In the mid-Twenties, the RSS outlined an extremely clever and sophisticated strategy 

and it has worked at it with dedication for some eight decades now. The members 

refused to call themselves a political body and focussed on culture. The basic 

idea was brilliant and simple. In the Twenties and Thirties, nationalism dominated 

the social culture of the Indian people. The RSS aimed to replace it with Hindutva 

and the ideal of a Hindu rashtra, which would reduce non-Hindus to the 

status of a subject population. They did not get very far until the emotive issue 

of Ramjanambhoomi was successfully manipulated, with massive financial aid from 

NRIs, to catapult a party which had only two seats in parliament to the position 

of the single largest party. 

We can learn something from this staggering record. 

To eradicate the poison of communal hatred, we need a countrywide organization 

? not a political alliance or a party, but an organization which would project 

and try to inculcate values most relevant for positive developments in our society 

in the 21st century. Away from the goal-oriented and highly purposive education 

with which our elite students and their parents seek to facilitate the passage 

of our youth to the United States of America, or to highly paid jobs in the corporate 

sector, this cultural organization should try and spread out into every area of 

our social life. The NGOs willing to cooperate could be used first for these purposes. 

And units should be established in as many universities, schools and colleges 

as possible. Such an organization should of course have a wide-ranging programme, 

trying to inculcate positive values through classes, discussion groups, drills 

and active involvement in social work. The organizational structure of the RSS 

provides an excellent blue print for such a body; only positive slogans have to 

replace its hate-filled negative messages, I feel sure that if initiative is taken 

to set it up, resources will not be a problem.

For the purposes of this essay, I shall focus only 

on one aspect of the possible activities of such an organization, ? the effort 

to replace inter-community hatred with healthier attitudes which would inform 

the future development of our society.

For this, we first need to understand the true nature 

and extent of the problem. In the Sixties, Aligarh University?s department of 

psychology did a limited but very focussed study of mutual images in the consciousness 

of local Hindus and Muslims. Similar random surveys in many parts of the country, 

focussing especially on areas with experience of inter-communal riots and strong 

RSS presence as well as Muslim ghettoes in urban complexes, might be illuminating. 

I am not suggesting a multi-million dollar research project supported by big US 

foundations, but a much more modest cottage-industry-style effort using local 

knowledge and interviews in depth. Voluntary contributions to such a study should 

be welcome. We assume we know what makes a communalist tick or what exactly is 

the nature and range of his impact, but do we? The exercise I have suggested would 

help us identify what to attack and how. Biographies of communal activists in 

both communities would be particularly welcome.

I think it is supremely important that liberal Muslims 

are involved in such organized activity. The orthodox ignorant mullah, 

whose mental world belongs to the middle ages, has to be expelled from his position 

of authority. Muslim society, especially Muslim women, must be free from their 

unwholesome influence. The liberal Muslim at some point in time has to take courage 

in both hands and initiate legislations which are in conformity with contemporary 

needs without references to the scriptures. Muslim women have already shown considerable 

courage in such action. Our cultural movements must strengthen their hands. The 

obscurantist mullah is something of a paper tiger. It is worth noting that he 

does not enjoy the support of the majority virtually in any Muslim country. The 

liberal or radical citizens of India, whatever their community, must at some point 

stop being mealy-mouthed in criticizing the reactionary obscurantist.

We also need true histories of inter-community conflict, 

a history of hatred ? la Annales school. The xenophobic Hindu historian 

talks endlessly of Muslim tyranny, the vile nature of the Yavana beast. The radical-liberal 

historians, on their part, really do not help by playing down the facts of Muslim 

iconoclasm and temple destruction. Whether a Rama temple once stood where the 

Babri mosque was later erected is an almost irrelevant issue. What matters is 

that such things did happen all over Northern India. Like Eaton, we need to understand 

and inform the lay public of the true nature and context of such happenings. More 

important, we historians have done a great disservice to our people by virtually 

papering over the history of violent inter-community conflicts. School text-books 

gloss over them with one-liners. As the historians of the Subaltern group are 

now pointing out, the history of Indian independence and partition virtually relegates 

the horrendous suffering of the partition riots, which took some five million 

lives, to brief footnotes.

In our cultural propaganda, several points need to 

be emphasized. First, we should neither over- nor underplay the fact of communal 

tension in the past. What we need to emphasize is that such tensions were real 

enough but they shared space in our social consciousness with the far more dominant 

traditions of co-existence, cooperation and cultural symbiosis. As Rabindranath 

Tagore pointed out in a seminal essay, the material and cultural environment of 

the Indo-Islamic era and its inheritor, our contemporary culture, are the joint 

handiwork of Hindus and Muslims. From fabric, dress, food to painting, architecture 

and music, all our civilizational and artistic output bears the impress of two 

distinct traditions so interwoven that they cease to be identifiable as separate 

entities. These are facts accessible to our sense perceptions. And if the two 

communities were continually at loggerheads, the marvellous products of our composite 

civilization would not have been there.

In being honest about the facts of tension and conflict 

in the past, we should locate these in the context of world history. Modern Britain 

is the result of a union between four ethnic groups with a very long history of 

bitter conflict. So is Germany the end product of union between warring principalities. 

Memories of such ancient or even recent conflicts usually do not poison the present, 

though old memories at times inform current action, as in Scotland and Wales. 

It does not help to nurture grievances, especially those picked up selectively 

from the remote past. If Turkish kings destroyed Hindu temples, it does not help 

to avenge the insult by attacking mosques today and killing the descendants of 

poor Muslims who were converts from Hindu society. Such actions merely distract 

us from our task of moving forward and undermine our basic humanity. Our cultural 

propaganda must emphasize not highfalutin ideas but solid good sense. Togadia 

may want to hang Ghazni, but Ghazni is long dead. To kill and rape fellow citizens 

because they share Ghazni?s faith are acts of sadistic morons.

One final word. On Kurfurstendam, in the centre of 

Berlin, stands a stone plaque. It lists without comment the Nazi death camps. 

The Museum of German history in the same city contains an entire section, Hitlerfeld, 

detailing those horrors. A young German writer wrote a play entitled ?Was I there 

when Hitler ruled?? He answers the question in the affirmative, because later 

generations of Germans, he believes, have not done enough to exculpate the guilt. 

What about us? What have we done to repent and transcend the sins of our partition 

riots? Does any Hindu or Muslim in the three countries of the subcontinent feel 

ashamed that they are descended from the monsters of the partition riots in 1946-47 

or of the Dhaka pogrom in 1971. Have we apologized for what we did to Delhi?s 

Sikhs? We need a black book of our misdeeds to be made available to every literate 

person in three countries. We need museums dedicated to the horrors of communal 

riots, so that the rising generations learn to hang their heads in shame for the 

sins of their forebears and say, ?Never again.?

CONCLUDED

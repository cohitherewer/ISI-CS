 A PERFECT THEORY OF COMBAT

 Still relevant

On Clausewitz: A study of Military and political 

ideas

By Hugh Smith,

Palgrave, pound;50

Carl von Clausewitz, the Prussian military-officer- 

turned-philosopher, published his magnum opus, On War, between 1832 

and 1834. From the middle of the nineteenth century till the Eighties, Clausewitz 

was regarded as the greatest military philosopher of the Western world. However, 

the rise of low-intensity wars from the Nineties has put his reputation on the 

docks. In this book, Hugh Smith assesses the relevance of Clausewitzs 

theories in contemporary warfare.

 Contradictions are inherent in the Clausewitzian paradigm. Clausewitz, influenced by the Romantic philosophy that was sweeping over Germany in the early nineteenth century, challenges the dogma that all human actions could be reduced to universal laws. On War begins by asserting that a general theory of warfare is impossible. Warfare is shaped by chance, passion and heroic individuals, rather than by universal laws. Clausewitzs outlook in On War is narrow because his theories are based on French revolutionary warfare and the Napoleonic wars. He also remains Eurocentric and concerns himself only with inter-state warfare.

 So how significant is Clausewitz for understanding warfare, especially after 9/11? Martin van Creveld, in The Transformation of War, argues that the Clausewitzian age of battles with large armies is pass. Today, terrorists and computer hackers are waging a new kind of war, which Clausewitz did not even dream of.

 Yet, Smith claims that some of Clausewitzs concepts remain relevant for analysing modern, sub-state war. For instance, Clausewitz speaks of friction in conducting conventional war. This is still true as even marginal groups conducting irregular war suffer from friction. 

 Clausewitzs famous assertion that war is a continuation of politics by other means has been accepted by both Marxists and Mao Zedong. Mao, one of the greatest practitioners of guerrilla warfare, underlined the importance of political dimensions of military action following Clausewitzian principles. For the sub-national groups waging intra-state war, politics remains the crucial factor in shaping their military responses to the state.

 The most important contribution of Clausewitz is to suggest that military strategy should always be secondary to political judgement. For the polities fighting terrorism, it is all the more important to prevent the militarization of society. Smith claims that modern day politicians, following Clausewitzs argument, should keep a tight leash over military actions in small wars. In the case of counter-insurgency operations, it is necessary to keep the deployment of forces limited in order to prevent the media from raising a hue and cry. Military leaders fighting the insurgents always try to clamp down civil liberties. Hence, it is essential for the cabinet and the parliamentarians to educate military leaders about the political objectives of a conflict.

 It is too early to dump Clausewitz. Ironically, despite challenging the viability of a universal theory of warfare, Clausewitz comes up with a general theory of conflict. Despite several limitations, the Clausewitzian framework instead of being rejected outright needs to be updated and modified by theorists to understand the future nature of warfare.

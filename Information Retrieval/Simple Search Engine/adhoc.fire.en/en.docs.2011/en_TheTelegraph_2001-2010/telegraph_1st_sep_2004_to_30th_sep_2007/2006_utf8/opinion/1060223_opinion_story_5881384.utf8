The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 NOT SO LIQUID

 Liquidity has tightened sharply in the debt market. Short-term interest rates had already moved up prior to the Reserve Bank of India hiking rates by 0.25 per cent, and the situation has got worse since then. Even the cancellation of a bond auction by the government (which would have sucked out more liquidity) has not improved sentiment in the market, and bond yields have continued to move up. Perhaps the best gauge of the tight liquidity conditions is that banks have been lining up at the RBI to borrow funds. The rapid rise in non-food credit has led to a resource crunch with banks because their deposits are not growing as rapidly as credit. This has led to banks selling off their investments in government securities in an effort to garner funds. The selling pressure leads to lower bond prices and higher yields. The tight conditions in the money market have already led to a rise in effective borrowing rates for corporate organizations. The interest rate for top-rated corporate commercial paper has risen by more than 2.5 percentage points in the last five months. Rates for long-term loans too have moved up, as seen from ICICI Bank?s decision to hike its prime lending rate. Blue chip companies, which borrowed at rates well below the PLR, have also seen a rise in their borrowing costs. Banks have already announced a hike in their rates of interest on retail loans and mortgages.

 Why is liquidity so tight? The explanation lies in the rising current account deficit. While inflows both from foreign institutional investors and external commercial borrowings remain strong, these inflows are increasingly being offset by the higher current account deficit. The banking system?s net foreign exchange assets have increased by a mere 0.4 per cent this fiscal compared to a rise of 12.7 per cent over the same period last year.

 Will interest rates rise sharply enough to derail the recovery, as had happened in the mid-Nineties? That seems unlikely, because rates today are still way below the 16 and 17 per cent rates in the mid-Nineties. Moreover, salaries too have gone up and the rise of 50 basis points or so in home loan rates should not make much of a difference, partly because banks prefer to extend the tenure of the loan rather than increase monthly instalments. Also, the outlook on inflation is likely to be more benign, not only because of a good rabi crop but simply because the incremental increase in crude oil prices is unlikely to be as sharp as that last year. Under the circumstances, the RBI could afford to pursue a more relaxed monetary policy, providing a cap to interest rates.

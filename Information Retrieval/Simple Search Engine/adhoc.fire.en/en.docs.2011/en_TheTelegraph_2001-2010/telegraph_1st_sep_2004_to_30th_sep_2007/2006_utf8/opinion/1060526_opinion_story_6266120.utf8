 Paperback Pickings

 A peek inside the head

 The Women in Cages (Penguin, Rs 275) 

by Vilas Sarang is a collection of short stories written in a singular 

style and with vivid imagination. There are touches of Kafka and Marquez in Sarang?s 

work. In one story, a man wakes up one morning to find that he has been transformed 

into a gigantic phallus overnight, attracting devotees to worship him as the ?live 

symbol of shiva?, while in another, a military general bans an entire season for 

the fear of being upstaged in a revolution. The stories in the collection oscillate 

between the bizzare to the humourous, with characters that inhabit an alternative 

universe, which is at once imaginary and real. 

 Londonstani (HarperCollins, ?7.99) 

by Gautam Malkani starts with the following sentence ? ?Serve him right 

he got his muthafuckin face fuck?d, shudn?t b callin me a Paki...? This, according 

to Malkani, is the way ?young Asians...assert their own, singular brand of Britishness?. 

The language ? ?a mixture of slang, texting, Panjabi and bastardised gangsta rap? 

? is as colourful as the four young protagonists who chase their dreams in a ?souped-up? 

Beemer in a foreign land. However, Malkani manages to weave in interesting sub-plots 

into the main story ? questions of tribalism, integration and ?complicated family-related 

shit?. But what comes of this eclectic ensemble is difficult to fathom, even for 

those who claim to understand Eminem.

 Collected Poems: 1970-2005 (Penguin, Rs 

350) by Keki N. Daruwalla brings together over decades of poetry written 

by one of India?s most accomplished poets. Daruwalla?s forte is his trademark 

vigour, an incisive tone and a restrained imagination, with the help of which 

he addresses a myriad subjects that include culture, religion, myth, history and 

passion. What stays in the reader?s mind after leafing through the pages of this 

book is the beauty and the sadness of Daruwalla?s verse ? ?The chinar confronts 

the sunset/ with its own dusk./ You can hear the drip of crinkled leaf./ Isn?t 

this what they call dry rain,/ this slow, twisting dead-moth descent/ from the 

sapless branch?

 Key Thinkers in Psychology (Sage, ?19.99) 

by Rom Harr? is a textbook that takes a closer look into the history of 

psychology. Combining the personal histories of key thinkers and their contributions 

to the discipline, Harr? has put together an interesting book that will have many 

takers among those who study and teach the subject.

The Puffin Book of Classic School Stories (Puffin, 

Rs 250) edited by Ruskin Bond brings together some of the classic tales 

that all of us have grown up with. David Copperfield, Tom Brown and Jane Eyre 

are all present in this hilarious and heartwarming collection which will transport 

us back to those wonder years spent in school.

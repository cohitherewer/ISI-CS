 THE CRITICAL EYE

 Madhubala as Anarkali

 The Art of Cinema: An Insider?s Journey Through Fifty Years of Film History By B.D. Garga, 

 Penguin, Rs 495

 ?The marvellous barbarity of this art enchants me,? wrote Ren? Clair, the French film-maker, ?Here at least is virgin soil, dear optical illusion, you are mine?whose pliant features mould themselves to my will.?

 B.D. Garga echoes Clair?s sentiments as he journeys through half a century of film history in The Art of Cinema. Starting right from its inception, and then working through various technical as well as aesthetic innovations, he meticulously maps the unfolding of both world and Indian cinema. He begins by providing an overview of the different technical aspects of a film and their significance. Garga applauds the ?men behind the scenes?, starting from the director and his ?eye?, the cameraman, to the editor and the sound recordist. These essays also record, on the side, the progress of cinema as the new medium of expression, outlining the various genres and movements that shaped its sensibility.

 The reader is introduced to the stalwarts in Indian cinema through pithy vignettes, the chapters often beginning with poetry. The author describes, in lucid prose, the contributions of pioneers like Himansu Rai, P.C. Barua, V. Shantaram, K. Asif, Guru Dutt and Raj Kapoor in building the foundations of the Indian film industry. Being a film historian, and having worked with the likes of Shantaram and an acclaimed film journalist like K.A. Abbas, Garga?s essays have fine threads of nostalgia woven into them.

 After fondly revisiting the classics ? P.C. Barua?s Devdas, one of the first screen adaptations of a novel, Achhut Kanya, a brilliant effort at depicting the vices of the caste system by the Indo-German partnership of Himansu Rai and Franz Osten, Mother India, a remake of the 1940 film Aurat, and finally Mughal-e-Azam, the epic tragedy of Salim and Anarkali ? Garga gives a treatise on mis-en-scene, or the way cinematic space is created.

 The discussion on film language brings in the Soviet montage, with Eisenstein?s celebrated Battleship Potemkin, Pudovkin?s premier role in Russian cinema and glimpses of Swedish films. Garga shows how distinct film languages create different genres of cinema ? Satyajit Ray?s Pather Panchali has glimpses of French impressionism in it. He also explores the components that defined the language of the talkies ? the background and soundtrack. Literature, sex, tragic grandeur, politics, colour and other themes in Indian film narrative are briefly touched upon.

 Satyajit Ray, India?s most eminent representative in the global film scenario, is duly described by Garga as ?one of cinema?s great exponents? in the article devoted to him. Short films are discussed, though from the number of documentaries Garga made, starting with the critically acclaimed Storm over Kashmir, it is obvious what film form captivated him. 

 The author signs off with ?Fragments of a Life? ? snapshots from his memorable career spanning more than 60 years of work as a photographer, documentary film-maker, film journalist, critic and historian.

 The book includes about 40 memorable photographs, taken by the author himself, of some cherished moments of Indian film history. It has a delightful foreword by Dileep Padgaonkar. The book will please the connoisseur and be a useful guide for students of cinema.

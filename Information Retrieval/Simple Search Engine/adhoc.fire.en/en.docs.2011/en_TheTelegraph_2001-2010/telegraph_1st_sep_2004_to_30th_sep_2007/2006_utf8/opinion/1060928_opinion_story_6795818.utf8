 AGAINST REFORM

 Discretion is the worst part of policy. It may now have been decided that prime agricultural land will not be diverted for use as special economic zones, but distortions caused by SEZ policy encompass more than land. SEZs belong to an era when general liberalization was not possible and one reformed in enclaves. Procedural costs, for example, should be eased everywhere, not just in SEZs. Nor should infrastructure be improved in SEZs alone. The tax reform agenda visualizes an end to discretions and fiscal concessions, with an integrated goods and services tax. By introducing direct and indirect tax concessions, SEZs not only deviate from this agenda, they create distortions and arbitrage opportunities for relocating investments from elsewhere in the economy to SEZs. Transaction costs for relocating are lower for Information Technology. So many SEZs tend to be IT-related. 

 It is noteworthy that fiscal sops exist not only for exports, but for everything. Indeed, present SEZ guidelines have no export requirement, they only have a net foreign exchange balancing condition. Minimum alternate tax, fringe benefit tax, service tax, dividend tax, excise and sales tax concessions are offered regardless of exports. This is true not only of developers, who may hypothetically build better infrastructure, but also of units in SEZs that benefit from improved infrastructure. This is inequitable and the commerce ministry argument that present SEZs, unlike past free trade zones or export processing zones, save public resources is a red herring. No figures are available on revenue foregone, which are also public resources that could have been spent elsewhere, including infrastructure development. Nor are figures available on new investments, vis--vis relocated investments. To make matters worse, land markets have been distorted, with state governments offering land (sometimes agricultural) at subsidized rates or gratis. Land usage and real estate development should be liberalized everywhere. Instead, housing and educational institutions are being selectively allowed in SEZs. Small-scale units that cannot relocate to SEZs because of high land-costs suffer in the process. There are also issues of compensation, with courts stepping in, because original acquiring took place at a fraction of present land prices. 

 With so many arbitrage opportunities, it is no wonder that the private sector is falling over backwards to set up SEZs. While the issue may have been temporarily postponed, eventually there will be a cap on the number of SEZs, thereby indirectly introducing licensing. The commerce ministrys figures on exports, investments and employment are a non-issue, because such multiplier benefits accrue from investments anywhere, not just in SEZs. SEZ policy runs counter to everything reforms were supposed to accomplish. The policy (with rules) has been in effect for a little over six months. Reversal is still possible.

 Letters to Editor

 Calling names

 Sir The report, One S for sorrow, two means no S-cape (Dec 21), ironically, may end up encouraging superstition among todays youth by making them believe that the root of their troubles lies in their initials. If some people with names beginning with the letter S are going through hard times, it is merely a coincidence. The star, Saturn, has nothing to do with this. Young boys and girls, with two Ss in their names, can easily be misled by such reports. They may now start blaming their parents for christening them inauspiciously.

 Yours faithfully,

 Chameli Pal, Batanagar

 Faded greens

 Sir The passing of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Bill comes as welcome news for tribals and forest dwellers who had been denied the legal right of the land they live in (Forest law for tribals, as Left likes it, Dec 16). The tribes are integral to the ecosystem and our forests will survive only if the people who live in them are made keepers of the natural world. It is heartening to note that the government has realized this. But a lot needs to be done. Political parties should support to the government to ensure the welfare of the tribal people.

 Yours faithfully,

Shailesh Kumar, Bangalore 

 Sir One suspects that the forest dwellers bill will give the tribals the right to plunder and destroy forests at will. As the tribal population increases over the years, the flora and fauna will be exploited to meet their burgeoning needs. The politicians who have helped pass the new bill have their eyes set on votes and care little for the natural world, which will be destroyed once the new bill comes into effect. If the government was really concerned with the welfare of tribals, then it would have arranged for their rehabilitation to urban areas and met their needs for education or employment. While the creamy layer of scheduled castes and tribes enjoys the benefits of reservation, the tribals have been forced to lead a hard life in the forests. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Mukherjee, Burdwan

 Sir Now that the government has given its nod to the forest bill, the countrys thinning green cover will face its biggest threat yet. The passing of the bill is a victory for politicians, mafias, poachers and so-called tribal welfare activists. Once tribals are allowed to use the forestlands freely, it will be only a matter of time before the remaining forests vanish forever. 

 Yours faithfully,

A. Goswamy, Jamshedpur

 Parting shot

 Sir The Union health ministers decision to ban junk food and drink in schools and universities is unlikely to serve any purpose (Samosas and Arsenic, Dec 16). On the contrary, such forcible prohibition will increase behind-the-counter sale of these banned drinks. The fear of pesticides in soft drinks did not have an adverse effect on the sale of aerated drinks. Similarly, statutory warnings on cigarette packets have had little or no effect on smokers. Like most steps taken by the government, this too is a half measure that fails to get to theroot of the problem. It must be pointed out that the Centres liberal economic policies have resulted in the market being flooded with junk food and colas. Therefore, it would be hypocritical on the part of the government to prohibit the products now. If the government was serious about healthcare, it would have put a stop to corporates manipulating the minds of consumers to boost the sale of unsafe products. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

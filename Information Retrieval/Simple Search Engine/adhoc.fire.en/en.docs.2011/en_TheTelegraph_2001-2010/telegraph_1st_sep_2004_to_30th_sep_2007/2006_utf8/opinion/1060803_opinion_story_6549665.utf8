 UNSEXING THE TALK

 Condoleezza Rice is a woman and she is trying her bit to bring to an end the Israel-Lebanon crisis. George W. Bush himself seemed confident that Rice would succeed where he would only talk. What made him so sure about Rices capability? Is it because Rice, being a woman, is peace-loving, open to compromise? Hell, no! It is because she is so damned efficient.

 Rice brings to her job all the qualities of an ace peace negotiator. She has plenty of charisma, carries the weight of Americas authority with ease and has years of experience in fire-fighting. There have been other women who have matched her efficiency take Monica McWilliams of the Northern Ireland Womens Coalition or Betty Bigombe in Uganda. 

 McWilliams and Bigombe, and very few others, have had the opportunity to sit at the negotiating table and drive hard bargains to forge peace. They are the Track One negotiators, and are extremely rare, despite the UNs 2001 resolution number 1325, which commits members to promote equal participation and full involvement of women in peace processes. Much of it is blamed on official apathy read male ego hassles but there are enough indications that panelized women do not answer calls from institutions like the UN to participate in a process which is risky and takes a heavy toll on their personal lives. The UN is not the sole recruiter of women. Governments are also responsible, and they continue to duck that responsibility.

 It is alright if women seek more participation in the peace process of any conflict-ridden country. But why should such participation be sought on the assumption that they are essentially more peaceable? The Greek authors Herodotus, Aeschylus, Xenophon, Ctesias leave us a vivid picture of womens inhumanity towards other women. There are the monstrosities of the Nazi camps, numerous instances of sexual abuse, killing of children, tortured daughters-in-law, domestic workers and animals in the past and present to suggest that women are not naturally compassionate creatures. Peace-makers themselves acknowledge that there is hardly any guarantee that gender-sensitive issues will be pushed if half the delegation is made up of women. Have you ever caught Hillary Clinton preaching peace for Iraq? Then why feed on stereotypical notions of women being nurturers and peace-lovers? In 1996, the UN had, in fact, acknowledged that neither man nor woman is innately peaceful.

 If women achieve something at the negotiating table, it is not because they are naturally gifted to that end, it is because they will it, making them forge cross-party and cross-cultural alliances. And much of this will is activated by the fact of their being most affected by the conflicts the loss of husbands and children and the threat of physical abuse. But even then, there are differences. A conflict may drive women as easily into armed terrorism as peace activism, although it is the latter which is the preferred alternative. If peace-making is so popular today among women it is because they discover through the process their own agency, albeit within the existing patriarchal norms and hierarchies. After all, sermons from a grieving mother are less threatening than the violence of a pregnant suicide bomber.

 This both inspires and limits the scope of what is called Track Two diplomacy. The gendered appeal is helping peace initiatives to cut across regional, political and even cultural barriers. But it is also limiting the process. Peace-making is seen as a hard-headed transaction to which the emotive emblems of the suffering mother, wife and daughter lose out. So despite there being no dearth of women activists and peace-makers, there are so few women peace-negotiators. To make that transition, women have to depend on their commitment as individuals trying to make peace in a conflict-ridden society. And we have to stop attributing their negotiating skills to gender alone. If mothers remain mothers, then boys will be boys, returning to their guns the moment mothers turn their backs.

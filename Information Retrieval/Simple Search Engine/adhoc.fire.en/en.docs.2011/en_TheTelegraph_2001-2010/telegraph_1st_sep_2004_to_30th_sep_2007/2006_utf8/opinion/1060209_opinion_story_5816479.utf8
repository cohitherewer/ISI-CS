 Letters to Editor

 Troubled future

 Sir ? It is difficult to agree with the editorial, ?Old friends? (Feb 6), which says that ?the presence of another nuclear-weapons state in a deeply volatile region of the world would undermine regional and international stability?. Time and again, Iran has insisted that its nuclear programme was meant for peaceful purposes such as generation of electricity. Why should other nations usurp its right to use the technology for development? Is India not doing the same?

 The United States of America has chosen to ignore North Korea?s nuclear activities. Why are two yardsticks being used for two nations guilty of the same crime? Why did the US not oppose Israel when it was developing nuclear weapons? Obviously, the US?s belligerence towards Iran has a lot to do with its protection of Israel?s interests. After devastating Iraq, it is now searching for an alibi to ruin Iran so that any threat, real or imagined, to Israel is eliminated.

 The US has used nuclear technology to cause more deaths and destruction in the world than any other country. Iran?s fear of the real intention of the US and Israel is not unfounded. Even if it wants to go nuclear to defend itself, it is fully justified in doing so. It is a pity that India has chosen to side with the US and the left in this country has been proved impotent after staging false protests against the Indian stand on Iran. A stronger opposition would have prevented the potentially calamitous decision.

 Yours faithfully,

 Serajuddin Khurram, Calcutta

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Old friends? (Feb 6), clearly indicates that keeping nuclear relations between India and the United States of America has acquired more importance than India?s relations with Iran. But if India?s logic for not being a part of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty rests on the belief that it is a tool for discrimination used by the rich nations against the poor, should it not have abstained from voting with the US at the International Atomic Energy Agency meet last year? India also possesses nuclear technology. Hence it has no right to deprive Iran of the same.

 Yours faithfully, 

Jang Bahadur singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? As Manmohan Singh indicated at the press conference in the capital prior to India?s vote at the IAEA last week, the United Progressive Alliance government will try its best to mellow the US stand on Iran, and give ?dialogue and diplomacy? another chance (?India set to vote with US?, Feb 3). Be it on the airport issue or Iran?s nuclear programme, the government has not given way to pressure from the allies, particularly the Left Front. This proves that it can muster the will to take correct decisions. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Bhilai

 Sir ? India?s decision to cast its vote against Iran in the IAEA meeting smacks of US pressure and shows how desperate India is to win America?s favours. Such a stance will definitely trap India in the web of US diplomacy. It is US?s habit to forcibly make a country act against its interests and then bog it down with economic sanctions and threats if it refuses to follow America?s instructions.

 Yours faithfully,

Shaghil Bilali, New Delhi 

 Sir ? Now that the Indian government has shown some courage by voting against Iran in order to report its controversial nuclear programme to the United Nations security council, it is the US government?s turn to suitably respond to the gesture. It is capable of pressurizing Pakistan to stop terrorism in India. The US must understand the UPA government?s necessity of justifying its action to the people. Unless the desserts follow, the government will buckle under domestic pressure.

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Keeping in mind the Iran nuclear controversy, it would have been appropriate had the big five ? the US, Russia, the UK, China and France, who possess nuclear weapons ? set an example by reducing their nuclear arsenal first before asking countries like Iran and North Korea to stop developing their nuclear capacity. In the absence of verifiable data mentioning the exact extent of nuclear weapons? reduction, their chiding of the smaller nations does not hold water. The big powers have sufficient nuclear arsenal to wipe out the whole world. Both the US and Russia have not adhered to the time-frame for nuclear arms reduction agreed upon under various treaties signed by them. This has posed grave threats to world peace as nuclear weapons may find their way into the black market or fall into the hands of international terrorists as adequate safeguards are not maintained. The US and the European community, in reporting Iran to the security council, have raised more questions than they can answer. Why wasn?t Israel referred to the UN when it developed its bomb? Had the procedure been followed, Iran probably would not have gone the nuclear way.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Kamat, Alto Porvorim, Goa 

 Sir ? The government has sought to defend its vote against Iran by saying that it is a diplomatic ploy to buy more time for Iran and avoid a full-scale confrontation with the US. However, there are not many takers for this rather convoluted explanation. India stands to lose not only vital energy deals with Iran but also its dignity. Manmohan Singh is facing serious criticism at home for the sharp tilt towards Washington from both the Bharatiya Janata Party as well as the Left Front. The left alleges that the Congress has violated the common minimum programme, which had promised to follow a non-aligned foreign policy. It is now demanding some kind of assurance from the government, which it is unlikely to receive. All this means further trouble for the nation over a problem far removed from its more crucial concerns.

 Yours faithfully, 

Mohondip Ray, Calcutta

 Sir ? The left is behaving in a strange fashion which shows its total ignorance of the reality. Its sole intention is to create as many hurdles as possible in the path of governance. First there was the rate of interest on the employees provident fund, then came the airport modernization and now the objection to the government?s decision to vote against Iran in the IAEA meeting. If the left feels that India?s independent foreign policy is being jeopardized by the vote against Iran, why do they think Russia and China have done the same? Are they not concerned about their own foreign policies? It is a shame that the left is trying to stand in support of a potentially rogue state like Iran, whose former record in meeting standards of international behaviour is not very respectable. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

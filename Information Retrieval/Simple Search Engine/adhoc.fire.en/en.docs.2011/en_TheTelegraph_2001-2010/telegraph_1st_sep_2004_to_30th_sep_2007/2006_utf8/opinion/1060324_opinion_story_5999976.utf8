 Paperback Pickings

 Secrets by the sea

 Shadows of the Pomegranate 

Tree (Seagull, Rs 295) by Tariq Ali is the first in a quintet 

of novels that traces the history of Islam. Ali?s real strength lies in his ability 

to weave history with fiction in a perfect symmetry. The story is set in Muslim 

Spain and describes the fall of Granada into the hands of an imperious Christendom. 

The book offers some interesting insights into the minds of the inhabitants of 

that doomed city. It also narrates the attempts made by these resolute men and 

women to continue living in the face of mounting odds. Ali?s book unravels a bitter 

truth: attempts to erase a particular culture or religion are integral to the 

workings of the human society.

Four steps from paradise 

(Penguin, Rs 325) by Timeri N. Murari would find many takers 

in the world of Indian soap opera. It tells the story of Krishnan, an eight year 

old, who has a charming life ? a ?sprawling mansion on a vast estate hidden in 

the heart of Madras? as his home, and a motley group of doting siblings, cousins, 

uncles and aunties who also ?squabble amiably? from time to time. But unknown 

to Krishnan, clouds gather on the horizon and threaten the contours of his idyllic 

life. The boy?s father ? a loner, who has been ?fatally seduced by the years he 

spent in Oxford? ? decides to bring Victoria Greene, an Englishwoman, into the 

conservative Naidu household, first as a governess and then as a stepmother to 

the children. Soon enough, the videshini, who has her man under her thumb, 

gets busy plotting a stake in the family inheritance, shattering the peace and 

happiness that had reigned for so long. Deception, lust, jealousy and betrayal 

are the themes that run through six hundred and fifty four pages, and some of 

the dialogues between the characters are straight out of a Bad-sex award-winning 

novel. Sample this conversation between Anjali and Krishna, in which she informs 

him that Bala, her husband, has been sleeping with his mom ? ?In sex, you can 

do everything and anything, believe me. Men with men, women with women, god knows 

what other things. He?s been sleeping with her for years....? You might not even 

want to gift a copy to someone you love to hate. 

 Swimming in the monsoon 

sea (Penguin, Rs 250) by Shyam Selvadurai is supposedly ?a 

coming of age book? that ?explores first love in all its complexity and turmoil?. 

Don?t expect a silly Mills and Boons romance though. Here we are talking about 

the kind of love that is deemed ?unnatural? by many societies even today. Amrith, 

aged fourteen, who loves playing Desdemona in his school?s rendition of Othello, 

falls in love with his cousin, Niresh, who comes calling from Canada. Niresh 

smokes, struts around naked in front of his cousin and even asks Amrith whether 

he is a tits-or-an-arse man. All Amrith can manage to do in return is try and 

snuggle close to Niresh in the dead of the night. There?s almost no sex, but plenty 

of things that show Amrith?s desire for Niresh is actually quite simple; it?s 

just an expression of innocuous, puppy love. 

 If: A collection of short 

stories (Rupa, Rs 195) by Neeru Nanda brings together ten 

stories that recount tales of human triumph in the face of adversity ? a widow, 

cheated by her second husband, ends up tearing her marriage certificate as a mark 

of protest; surrogate families rebuild their lives with a little help; and a fearless 

thirteen-year-old chooses to take her destiny in her own hands. Unfortunately, 

there is more kitsch than one can stomach in these pages and Ruskin Bond?s praise 

of the book comes as a real surprise.

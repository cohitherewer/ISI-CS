 BREAK OF A NEW DON

 Farhan Akhtar has given some fresh twists and 

turns to a Bollywood classic

 Choose your music, the wise ones always said, with care. Had Farhan Akhtar, for instance, been listening to Laras Theme from Dr Zhivago, instead of the soundtrack of a Hindi film made 28 years ago, Bollywoods contemporary history may have been written differently. 

 But, as luck or musical orientation would have it, the young director was playing a song from Don when the proverbial bulb flashed an idea into his brain. Farhan immediately jumped up and said that we should remake Don, says his old friend Ritesh Sidhwani, the producer of the film. 

 Farhan would have felt the need for a remake for he was all of four when the original film was released in 1978. For the Hindi film buff of that generation, Don was a blockbuster with a super star and a hit score. For Farhan, it was a film that starred Amitabh Uncle and Zeenat Aunty and had a screenplay written by dad Javed Akhtar. 

 The remake, which stars Shah Rukh Khan and was released to packed halls on Friday, has caused quite a stir. Old-timers and quite a few of those are still around would like to compare the new film with the original. Not surprisingly, Farhan is looking a bit green about the gills, though his words are brave. Very few people are lucky enough to have the chance to recreate a piece of work that they admire. Instead of approaching it with fear, I did it with a lot of enthusiasm and excitement, he says. 

 Not everybody, of course, is as enthusiastic, for remakes dont always outdo the original. But actor Shah Rukh Khan is convinced that the 2006 version is going to spell good news for his friend. Farhan has given some fresh twists and turns to this film and has put in more realism to keep pace with todays films, he says. 

 Farhan, clearly, has been working hard. He was earlier a part of Pankuj Parashars directorial team for the Akshaye Khanna debut film Himalayputra. For three years, he worked at Adi Pochas Script Shop where he learnt everything from production design to anchoring and post production. 

 A brat in college, till he decided to drop out in favour of cinema, Javed and Honey Iranis son has done a lot of film viewing in recent times. For two years, he watched all kinds of films and then decided to make something that others would watch. The result was Dil Chahta Hai, his debut film of 2001. I wanted to make a film which people could identify with. That was important for me, says Farhan. 

 His friends and relatives hold that Farhans USP is his ability to think on his feet. Wife Adhuna says the one thing she loves about her husband is speed. Farhan is quick with everything. He takes his decisions quickly as well and takes just five minutes to get ready, says Adhuna, who was the hair stylist for Dil Chahta Hai. 

 Javed Akhtar recalls how stunned he was when he was trying to relate the story of Lakshya something that he had just scripted to Farhan. I just wanted him to listen to the script. He heard it, nodded and said that he would like to direct the film himself. Thats how I came back to writing movies after a break, says Javed Akhtar. 

 For Farhan, the Akhtar-Irani tag could only have helped. He grew up in the midst of Urdu poetry his grandfather, after all, was Jaan Nissar Akhtar, considered one of the greatest poets of his time. Not surprisingly, the entire family is immersed in cinema. Mother Honey Irani, a child actress, is an established script writer, and his sister Zoya has directed a film called Luck By Chance which was, incidentally, written by Farhan. 

 And now, in this age of multi-tasking, Farhan is all set to try out something new. The director makes his debut as an actor in Anand Surapurs film Fakir, starring Annu Kapoor and Kamal Sidhu. I have known Anand for long. It is a film that is very earthy and deep-rooted. I heard the story and agreed, says Farhan, the impulsive. 

 In most cases, though, Farhans gambles have paid off. Dil Chahta Hai was a cult film in urban India, and Lakshya was a star-studded war film. Amitabh Bachchan, who starred in and as Don in N. Chandra Barots film, is convinced that the remake will do well. When Javedsaab told me that his son Farhan was remaking Don, I felt relieved. I have worked with him in Lakshya and knew that Don was in safe hands, says Amitabh Bachchan. 

 But when remakes and remixes are often seen as short cuts to fame, Farhan Akhtars legion of friends and fans has been singing paeans to the new venture. Not surprisingly, the new Don friend Shah Rukh is not worried about critics who flay remakes. Ram Gopal Varmas Sholay has run into legal trouble, and actor-director Dev Anand was openly hostile to director Rituparno Ghoshs dream of remaking Guide. 

 Shah Rukhs take on the subject is somewhat different. I think the best way to pay tribute to a great film is by remaking it, says Khan.

 Power and its fallouts

 Sir The crime graphs of politicians in India have steadily been on the rise. No doubt the hapless citizens are always at the receiving end of the criminal manoeuvres of their leaders. So, the people have reason to be happy about the life sentence awarded to the former coal minister, Shibu Soren, for his role in the murder of his personal assistant, Shashinath Jha (From cabinet to life in Cell No. 3, Tihar, Dec 8). It is for the first time in the Indian democracy that a cabinet minister has been sentenced for any crime. Hopefully, this verdict will be a precedent for similar cases in future so that the parliament is gradually rid of the criminal elements.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Narayan, Mumbai

 Sir Shibu Sorens arrest and conviction should not strike us as exemplary. We have politicians with criminal records who are still in office. Their political clout has stalled their conviction. For most politicians, the mantra is that the taste of power can only be felt in its misuse. There are few netas in the country who have not had a brush with chargesheets, police, courts and scandals. Only a handful of our leaders really deserve our respect or have the potential to lead the country towards its goals. 

 While the punishment and fine are all very well, one has to keep in mind the grief inflicted by these politicians on the families of their victims. Is the amount of Rs 5 lakh compensation enough for Jhas family? 

 Yours faithfully,

Rajesh Das, Dhenkanal, Orissa

 Sir Peoples appreciation for the judgments delivered to Shibu Soren and Navjot Singh Sidhu are largely the result of widespread media coverage. Going by past records, these cases are far from over, since fresh appeals are most likely to be filed at higher courts. However, Sorens case has at least reached some conclusion, though he might take it to the Supreme Court. One wishes that the other tainted ministers, who already have cases pending against them, are dealt with fast and just as severely, so that the normal government machinery is not stalled for too long. The courts should not tolerate delays. The sooner the punishments are given, the easier it will be to sieve out the dirt from the administration. 

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir The Supreme Courts dictum is that the death sentence should be awarded only in the rarest of rare cases. Shibu Soren has been convicted in the premeditated, cold-blooded murder of his personal secretary. Since he has not been given the death sentence, we can presume that this is not a rarest of rare offence. It will be interesting to know what kind of murder fits this category. Is the severity of a crime determined by the social status of the accused? Besides, in India, the life-term does not exceed 14 years, whereas in most other countries, it is longer. So life-imprisonment becomes rather meaningless in India. The statute books should perhaps consider some alterations. 

 Yours faithfully,

C.V.K. Moorthy, Bangalore

 Sir The recent verdicts in the criminal cases lodged against Shibu Soren and Navjyot Singh Sidhu indicate that our judicial procedures are becoming faster and more effective. Although it comes after 12 years, the Soren verdict serves as a consolation for the aggrieved family of Shashinath Jha. However, it is shocking that a much-respected person like Soren whose efforts gave birth to the state of Jharkhand could get involved in such a murky affair. Sorens punishment should serve as a warning for all dishonest politicians who think that their power and position have placed them above the law. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir There is not one but many Shibu Sorens in the country who are not interested in serving the people but only in realizing their petty self-interests. It is little wonder then that the most depraved of people often hold positions of authority. With dishonest men at the helm, many of the honest ones are tempted to follow their lead. The apex courts decree that the governments sanction is not required for the trial of government servants is a relief. Now there should be more laws to prevent persons with dubious records from occupying important posts in the country.

 Yours faithfully,

Salil Gewali, Shillong

 Sir Although Navjyot Singh Sidhu resigned as a member of parliament as soon as the court convicted him, Shibu Soren was reluctant to let go so easily, so he resigned only from his ministerial duties. As soon as a court convicts a person, he should automatically cease to be a minister, a legislator or a parliamentarian. A convicted criminal should not be allowed to continue in office. Sadly, the ruling party is found to relax the rules every now and then. 

 Yours faithfully,

M.M. Kale, Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh

 Sir First, the life-term given to Sibu Soren, and now the Supreme Court doing away with the need to obtain prior sanction for prosecuting corrupt politicians and bureaucrats. These are heavy blows to the political class of the country. There is a distinct possibility that they will start plotting some way to clip the wings of the judiciary. One fears that they will not hesitate to amend the Constitution for this purpose. 

 Yours faithfully,

N.K. Das Gupta, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir The report, Gee! Ghees now heart-friendly (Dec 9), while applauding the efforts of Darshan Lal and his colleagues in making ghee 80 per cent cholesterol free, also mentions that this would not be an ideal solution. The fat content of ghee is far more than the cholesterol count. Is this just a move to boost ghee sales in the country? Or has India finally devised a way to eliminate harmful cholesterol? 

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, Calcutta

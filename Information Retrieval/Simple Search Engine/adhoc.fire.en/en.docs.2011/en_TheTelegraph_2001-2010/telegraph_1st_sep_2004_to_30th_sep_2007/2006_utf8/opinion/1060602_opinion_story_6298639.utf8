 NO ILLUSIONS

 India?s relationship with China is never free of baggage: faith or mindless hostility. The recent visit of the defence minister, Mr Pranab Mukherjee, to China brought out the complexities of New Delhi?s relationship with Beijing. Although the visit has resulted in tangible gains, it is clear that Sino-Indian relations will continue to be defined as much by competition as by cooperation. Consider first the good news. The Indian defence minister and his Chinese counterpart, General Cao Gangchuan, signed the first-ever memorandum of understanding between the defence ministries of the two countries. This MoU seeks the institutionalization of the frequent exchanges between the officials of the ministries and the armed forces. In addition, both sides will develop an annual calendar for joint exercises and training programmes. While India and China have conducted joint naval activities in the Indian Ocean, there has been little contact or cooperation outside this limited area. There has been, for instance, virtually no contact between the air forces. 

 Clearly, both sides now believe that strengthening effective contacts in the field of defence is of vital importance to enhancing mutual trust and understanding between the armed forces and to ensure a stable environment in the region. At one level, the MoU seems to have laid to rest the ghosts of the Sino-Indian war of 1962. But, at another, the most potent reminder of the conflict is still the non-resolution of the border issue. Recall that the two governments appointed special representatives to address the border issue in June 2003, and the seventh round of talks was held in India in March. The Chinese leadership gave no new assurances to Mr Mukherjee on this issue. The fact is that Sino-Indian relations cannot totally normalize unless the border issue is resolved, and New Delhi is no longer suspicious of Chinese intentions in this context. 

 But both the boundary issue and the MoU must be located in a wider context. In contemporary international politics, with its new balance of power, emerging powers like India and China face a complex challenge. They will need to cooperate on a variety of issues, even while competing in other areas. Sino-Indian trade has increased rapidly in the last few years; so has the tourist traffic between both sides. Yet, China is reluctant to accept India within the nuclear suppliers group or as a member of the United Nations security council. The most important challenge for India, thus, is to promote friendly ties with China while remaining cautious. Strong pragmatism should guide the future of bilateral relations rather than faith in the illusion of ?Hindi-Chinee bhai bhai?.

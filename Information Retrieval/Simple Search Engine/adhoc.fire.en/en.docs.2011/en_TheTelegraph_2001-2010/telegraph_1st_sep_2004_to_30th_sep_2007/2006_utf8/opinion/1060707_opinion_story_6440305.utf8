 AS THE NATION GOES, SO GOES THE POPULAR

Of the people: Essays on Indian popular culture 

By Biswarup Sen, 

Chronicle, Rs 575

 How does one go about making sense of 21st-century India? This is undoubtedly a complex and difficult task. But Biswarup Sen proposes to accomplish this by carefully examining Indian popular culture and its symbols, such as cricket and Bollywood films. The choice of popular culture as a medium of exploring contemporary India has its share of critics. But Sen insists that elements of popular culture are legitimate tools to comprehend India and its own kind of modernity. This is so because the rise of industrial capitalism had led to the emergence of arts, entertainment and the media, all of which mirror social reality. These not only help in achieving a deeper understanding of modernity, but also lead to the making of culture itself.

 Interestingly, in the course of examining elements of the popular, Sen debunks certain stereotypes associated with each. Thus the obsession with cricket in India has nothing to do with the game for Sen. It is, in fact, a desperate attempt to identify the nation with more advanced societies. Similarly, Sen says that the song-and-dance routine in Bollywood is not regressive, but ?a powerful act of imagining modernity?. 

 However, a study of contemporary India through the lens of popular culture can never really take off without a proper analysis of what ?popular? is. Ascertaining what is popular must go together with a scrutiny of modernity, as ?popular culture is a phenomenon of the modern age?. Delving into history, Sen shows that the inception of an industrial society was characterized by the spread of suffrage, democracy and technology, all of which gave popular taste and will a value they lacked before. 

 However, the reciprocal relationship between the popular and modernity is far from simple. This is especially the case in a post-colonial society such as India where popular culture is often not so much an assertion of modernity as a fear of not being modern enough. The game of cricket is a perfect example of this anxiety to catch up with the West. Cricket gained favour with Indians as a medium for imitating the colonial masters. It could not quite become the national game during India?s freedom struggle. It was only after the collapse of Nehruvian socialism that India sought to rejoin the capitalist world, and cricket itself became a point of re-entry. 

 The fixation with cricket has come at a price. Cricket?s rise and subsequent dominance are inextricably linked to the decline of two other sports ? hockey and football. The dismal story of hockey has ?more to do with its minority status?, because ?unloved by the elite it proved unattractive for the investing classes?. The tale of Indian football is quite similar ? one of early promise and subsequent decline. The British brought football to India, and the Bengali babu, that weak effeminate creature long subject to mockery and caricature, took to the game as a route to assert his masculinity. Football soon sprouted nationalistic roots with Mohun Bagan?s historic win over East Yorkshire Regiment in the IFA Shield final. The game was also related to the complex issues of communalism, regionalism and identity, epitomized by the frenzy that surrounded an East Bengal versus Mohun Bagan match and the founding of Mohammedan Sporting as a centre for attracting Muslim soccer talent. However, the demise of football and the fact that it now only has a following in certain pockets of the country ? namely Goa and Bengal ? have a lot to do with crises in regional identity and economy. Sen?s theory is that the regional character of football prevented it from becoming a truly national sport. 

 Another critical element in Sen?s analysis is the music and song-and-dance routine in Hindi films. Sen challenges the view that dismisses Hindi film music as ?orchestrated mush?, which transports the audience to fantasyland. It is nothing of that sort. In fact, along with cricket, it is another cornerstone of what comprises the popular in India.

 Sen traces the evolution of popular Hindi film music to the absence of an art form that could express the sounds of modernity. The nation swayed (and continues to do so ) to the tunes composed by R.D. Burman and sung by Kishore Kumar ? two men who, according to Sen, ?were Bengal?s last gift to Indian modernity?. The legacy of the duo has been carried forward by the likes of Biddu and Bappi Lahiri, who have injected an astonishing hybridity to ensure that their music represents a vibrant cosmopolitan India. 

Sen attaches equal importance to song-and-dance in 

films. In his words, song-and-dance in movies is ?a crucial component of the text 

because it performs a function that the rest of the text...cannot perform? ? it 

also leads to the genesis of a space that is private and modern. In the final 

chapter, Sen turns his attention to the remodelling of ?desi? into ?global 

cool?, and locates this phenomenon in the quest for an identity on the part of 

the Indian diaspora.The emergence of a successful Indian diaspora has meant that 

the world is now discovering India through its expatriate community. Bhangra, 

pakoras and designer pujas have replaced sadhus, architecture 

and Sanskrit as the classic signifiers of Indianness. 

 What is noteworthy about Sen?s book is the manner in which he underlines the importance of popular culture as a vehicle for understanding continuity and change in India. Cricket and music have evolved into entities, whose significance go beyond the obvious. They, in fact, hold the key to the puzzle that is modern India.

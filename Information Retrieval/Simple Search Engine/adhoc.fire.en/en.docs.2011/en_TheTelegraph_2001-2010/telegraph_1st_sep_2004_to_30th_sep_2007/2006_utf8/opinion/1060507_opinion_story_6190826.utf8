The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 When it comes to journalists, Rahul Gandhi is very choosy. Only when they are Indian journos, though. Foreign journalists covering him in Amethi and in Rae Bareilly are finding him most accessible and friendly. No wonder the Times, London was quick to label him the future prime minister of India. While handling his mother?s campaign in Rae Bareilly, Rahul is known to have fixed days for interacting with local or national and international mediapersons. Scribes from the weekly magazines are finding this arrangement extremely inconvenient. But the young Gandhi is unfazed. This is not to say, however, that desi journos are not having fun following the Gandhis on campaign trail. One of them even played a prank, pointing at a visiting Delhi scribe as Rahul?s Venezuelan girlfriend. When people started rushing for a dekko, the poor girl had to run for cover. The truth had to come out, and the lady?s ?alleged? boyfriend too came to know. But like a true sport, Rahul Gandhi had a hearty laugh.

 Her son may be befriending new scribes, but Sonia Gandhi believes in trusting old loyalists. After the new-age Congress leaders goofed up on the office-of-profit issue, Madam is taking no risks. She has fallen back on the old Tiwari Congress faithfuls to organize her ?Return to Rae Bareilly? campaign. Another person who has been brought in from the cold is Satish Sharma, a common face in the old Rajiv Gandhi albums. Sharma, too, is making sure that he gets his sweet revenge for being kept out of the high table of Congress politics for so long. He is known to have convinced Rahul that no other Congress leader is allowed to put his foot on Rae Bareilly soil. A little note for those starching their spotless white kurtas and Nehru caps: Keep trying.

 It has been a long time since the vice-president, Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, requested the Union government for an ambulance, like the ones that accompany the president and the PM whenever they travel by road within the country. But the finance ministry had always raised the red flag on the ground that the government could not afford to stretch its expenses. But a request that had been rejected by the NDA government ? don?t forget Shekhawat is a BJP man ? has finally been approved by the UPA prime minister. So what if it meant overruling the finance ministry?s objections? It was only for an old man and his failing health.

 Air travel becoming cheaper is great news. Or is it? The other day, a young lawyer found herself stranded at the Srinagar airport, when her ?cheap? airline abruptly cancelled its flight to Delhi. She was told to come back two days later when the next flight to Delhi would leave. Would the airline arrange for accommodation for the two days? Of course not. When the lawyer confronted the airline staff ? blissfully playing solitaire on their computers ? she was asked to buy an Indian ticket and fly to Delhi if she was in a hurry. But why couldn?t the airline do the same, or book its stranded passengers into a hotel? ?Because we are a cheap airline. Either you suffer our erratic service or go fly on the regular-fare frontline airlines.? The lawyer was too stunned by the reply to read them her legal rights. She managed to reach the civil aviation minister, Praful Patel, who was only too aware of the erratic behaviour of private airlines. But he did arrange her flight back to Delhi. But then, our protagonist was just one among nearly a hundred passengers ? many of whom had to shell out a few thousands extra to get an Indian ticket. Could we have a regulatory body for these cheapskates please?

 It was shock and awe at the wedding of Congress Rajya Sabha MP Satyavrat Chaturvedi. The predominantly Congress gathering ? including Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh ? watched in shock when the baraat came in, led by none other than Amar Singh. Singh happened to be close to the groom?s father, the chairman of Noida Authority. The Samjwadi Party leader?s parting shot: Chalo, ab to Congressi apni betiyan hamare yahan bhejne lage (Even the Congressmen are sending their daughters to us these days)!

 Pramod Mahajan?s passing away was shocking too. But a bigger shock awaited some of the high-profile mourners at the choc-a-bloc cremation. One BJP leader found all his cash gone via a neat incision in his pocket, while another was lighter by his fancy mobile phone.

 Krishna on mahaprasthan. That may not be part of the Mahabharata script, but it?s true that Nitish Bhardwaj has packed off from politics and left for Mumbai to renew (or should we say start afresh?) his career in films and television. He leaves in his wake the Madhya Pradesh BJP in disarray. Krishna need not have deserted them so soon after Uma Bharti did! Bhardwaj was no Uma Bharti, but he was his party?s fallback option whenever it needed to field a candidate against a heavyweight. No wonder Bhardwaj was feeling a bit ?out of work... hanging out when nobody wants you?. They did not even allow him to take up the issue of the common civil code when he wanted to ? that too in the villages ? after the Imrana case. It was then that a tiny voice inside him asked him to shift base. ?At least in Mumbai I would be able to fulfil my creativity,? lamented Nitish. Even with so many brawny young men swarming around tinseltown? Are you absolutely sure, Krishnaji?

 DIVIDE AND BE RULED

 THE GALLANT DOGRAS: AN ILLUSTRATED HISTORY OF THE DOGRA REGIMENT Lancer, with the Dogra Regimental Centre, Rs 2,500

 The Sepoy Army was one of the chief pillars of colonialism in India. And recruitment of the ethnic population was one of the principal building blocks of this army. From the second half of the 19th century, the British started recruiting ?martial? ethnic communities in separate regiments. Thus came into existence Gurkha, Dogra and Sikh regiments. The aim was ?divide and rule?, that is to play off the various ethnic regiments against each other in order to prevent any homogeneous uprising against the raj.

 Like many other colonial institutions, fragments of the Sepoy Army continues to exist in post-colonial India, the Dogra Regiment for example. If anything, this ?martial? regiment has undergone further expansion after independence. During World War II, the regiment had 8 battalions, each possessing about 1,000 men. In 2005, the regiment comprised 19 regular battalions, 1 scout battalion, 3 Rashtriya Rifles battalion and 3 Territorial Army battalions.

 Part of the reason for this continuity and expansion is that India?s military establishment believes, like its colonial predecessor, that men from the cold mountainous regions, by nature, possess soldiering instincts. Hence, the thrust to recruit these ?born warriors?. The fact that in the economically backward hilly regions military service also offers a lucrative career never seems to have crossed the mind of the imperial military establishment. This absentmindedness also characterizes the post-1947 Indian military policy. It is to be noted that anthropologists while carrying out oral surveys have found out that many war veterans with Victoria Crosses, now living in the shanties in Nepal, remember that they joined the army for a ?sack of rice?.

 This is not to reduce combat motivation to a mere want for creature comforts. Men are attracted to war not merely by the lure of tangible incentives but also by certain customs and rituals. Here comes the function of regimental history. Along with regiments, the British introduced the tradition of churning out regimental histories. The Gallant Dogras is a typical regimental history.

 The objective of regimental histories is to propagate the glorious tradition of the specific regiments among the soldiers and the wider society. Every regimental history reads like an advertisement handbook. They follow what could be categorized as ?aggressive marketing?. The reader going through a particular regimental history will come across repeated assertions about that regiment being the best in the whole army. No regimental history will include incidents like mutiny, desertion, fragging or retreat. The soldiers of a particular regiment are always ?advancing?, ?fighting ferociously? or ?selling their lives dearly?, be the Dogras in Mesopotamia in 1918 or in NEFA in 1962, fighting against the Chinese in NEFA during 1962. The story line is the same ? heroism against heavy odds. Production of regimental history requires a patron. In the case of the Dogras, it is the present chief of army staff.

 It is not the intention of this reviewer to take pot shots at the Indian army for retaining the colonial system. Since independent India has failed to build any institution, it is better that it modifies and retains colonial institutions. Within the colonial military fabric, we have a defective army. Yet without colonial traditions, India might have had a rabble instead of an army.

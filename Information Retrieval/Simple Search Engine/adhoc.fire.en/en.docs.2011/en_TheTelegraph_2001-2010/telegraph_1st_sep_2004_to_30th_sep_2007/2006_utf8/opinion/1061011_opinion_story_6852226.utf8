The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 REVERSE FLOW

 It would be foolhardy to contest the pragmatism of a person who successfully converted economic theory into practice in the most trying of times for India. There is thus nothing surprising about the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, tracing a rather dismal picture of the study of sciences in India at a recent event at the National Academy of Sciences in Mumbai. Unlike many, the prime minister is not afraid to face the reality. But this is all the more reason his belief that his government will be able to affect a reverse brain-drain looks a trifle misplaced. Mr Singh has noted that the brightest of Indians, who had left the country to study abroad, are coming back to teach as visiting faculty in Indian universities. He wishes to consolidate this trend through better policies and better funds, and to disseminate the benefits of the knowledge economy beyond the borders of India. The sincerity in this pledge can hardly be doubted. But can he be sure that his overall philosophical commitment will not come in the way of this goal? Mr Singh is the pioneer of globalization in India. He has shown the way to a world without borders. In that world, the utilization of resources has no intrinsic connection with the place of its production. Be it economic or knowledge resources, geographical boundaries do not determine their flow. Why should then a doctor sans frontiers like Mr Singh prescribe a parochial principle like the draining back of intellectual wealth from one country to another? There can be no denying Indias need to be visited by the best of intellect. But will such self-pity be enough to assure that? 

 As the prime minister himself noted, it is the private sector which is attracting most of Indias lost brains. Perhaps there are some lessons to be drawn from that. There is no doubt that the return of native wisdom ought to be encouraged, but this could be achieved with less, and not more, intervention, and the bestowing of greater autonomy on the semi-private players in the knowledge market, such as Indias premier management institutes which are waiting to spread their wings. Besides being a hindrance to competition, a preoccupation with enticing teachers from abroad with higher salaries could be counterproductive to the other major concerns of the government, like primary education.

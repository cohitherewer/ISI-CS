The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 PART OF A NATION

 Pigeonholes are very good for letters but awful for human beings. But pigeonholing is a common practice, even among those who should know better. Stereotypes are formed by a swift, and often unwarranted, jump from the particular to the general. The prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, noted this when he told chief ministers to be wary of allowing individual acts of terrorism to stain the image of the entire Muslim community. It is a sad but undeniable fact that Muslim names figure prominently on lists of terrorists across the globe. But it is equally undeniable that Muslim terrorists form a minuscule minority when compared to the entire Muslim population of the world. The distinction is important to maintain, especially in a world whose intellectual space is held in thrall by the clash of civilizations theory. Mr Singhs comment was made in the context of the threat that terrorism poses to life and security in India. This gave to Mr Singhs words a certain urgency since the passion to combat terrorism might easily lead to a confusion of the particular and the general.

 The entire Muslim community should take serious heed of the prime ministers comment. There is a propensity among Muslim leaders to make the life of Muslims more difficult and complicated than it already is. This happens whenever the leadership speaks of the communitys special interests. Attempts to reform Muslim society in India have been slow. The global ambience has not facilitated the reform process. Muslim leaders trying to keep their brethren within the orthodox framework should remember that they are, out of choice, members of a nation-state which is committed to building a secular society. The modern nation-state has an inherent tendency to obliterate all other identities except the one affirming citizenship to the state. This process is never free of anguish. But the practice of democracy allows all communities an equal opportunity to fashion the character of the nation-state. This is where a democratic nation-state differs crucially from a non-democratic one. The founding fathers of the independent Indian nation-state recognized that Muslims and other communities needed, for historical reasons, special nurturing to make them equal participants in the making of the Indian state. Muslims in India should seize this opportunity and not allow orthodox elements to pull them back to the medieval world.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Heart of the matter

 AIIMS director P. Venugopal is a man of few words. But hes been done in by his verbally accusing health minister Anbumani Ramadoss of interfering in AIIMS

 Over his five-decade-long career, P. Venugopal was known to be a man of few words. Oral communication was never quite his forte ? his colleagues at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi say its director ? whose expulsion the Delhi High Court has put a stay on ? always preferred to let his hands do the talking. And considering that he was associated ? in one form or another ? with some 50,000 heart operations, it wouldnt be wrong to suppose that, as a cardiac surgeon, Venugopal had said enough already. 

 What, then, could be more ironic than the fact that it was his near-vestigial mouth that did Venugopal in? At an AIIMS general body meeting on Wednesday, Venugopal was found guilty of having flouted the institutes conduct rules by verbally accusing health minister Anbumani Ramadoss a few days ago of interfering in the affairs of AIIMS. Venugopals demeanour was found objectionable by 14 of the 17 members present at the meeting. The litany of complaints was a long one ? he had granted medicos permission to use the institute premises for anti-reservation protests in May, and then unilaterally decided to pay resident doctors for the days on which they had struck work. The much-expected sack ? given that personal differences between Venugopal and the health minister were no closet affair ? came that very evening. 

 Venugopal, predictably, didnt speak much. He let his actions take over ? public interest litigation was promptly filed in the Delhi High Court challenging the expulsion. That BJP leader Arun Jaitley is representing Venugopal in court doesnt surprise many ? the surgeon, who was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1998 for performing Indias first heart transplant operation in 1994, was long known to have been a political being. He knows the game of politics, says a former AIIMS doctor. 

 Political patronage, not to mention professional accolades, didnt come to Venugopal for nothing. The 64-year-old surgeons odyssey began in 1960, when he left his village in the Rajamundhry district of Andhra Pradesh to come to New Delhi and pursue his undergraduate studies at AIIMS. A gold medalist, he returned from the United States in 1974 after a stint at the Texas Heart Institute to establish an open-heart surgery programme in AIIMS under the supervision of cardiac surgeon N. Gopinath. 

 Old associates who have worked with him describe Venugopal as a man dedicated to his work, with a predilection for exploring new horizons in medical sciences. The cardiothoracic and vascular centre at AIIMS (which he helped set up in 1982) was his own baby, and he worked hard to make it a world-class place, says P.K. Dave, who preceded Venugopal as the institutes director. He was a kind and considerate doctor, and above all, a very good surgeon.

 Daves opinion is seconded by many doctors who have trained under Venugopal. He was a noble teacher, a committed professional and a man of indomitable courage, says A.K. Bisoi, one of Venugopals students and a cardiac surgeon. 

 But the man affectionately called Chief by his colleagues is not universally admired. Some believe that he ran the institute, and earlier his Centre, like an autocrat. Others complain about the bouts of eccentricity that he exhibited from time to time. 

 If insiders are to be believed, Venugopals inability to communicate was often offset by actions which at times bordered on the bizarre. A resident doctor states that the director would occasionally refuse to speak to his juniors for days on end. Venugopal had once reportedly caught a hospital sweeper smoking a beedi inside the patients ward. The sweeper was allegedly locked up in a room for an entire night ? such was the directors way of coming down on offenders. 

 The element of eccentricity also seemed to spill into Venugopals life outside the hospital. To a close circle of associates, he was known to be a man of extreme opposites. A former colleague recalls how a celebrity couple, upon paying a visit to the doctors residence for consultation, were surprised to be led into a spartan drawing room where trunks covered with bedspreads had been placed for guests to sit on. The austere Venugopal, who is known to lunch on frugalities such as rice, curd and pickle, urged the husband ? a former nawab ? to control his alcohol intake. And then, looking at his watch, he remarked: Its eight-thirty now, so how about a drink?

 That Venugopal is not much loved in the institute is apparent by the long list of grievances that his colleagues hold against him. A handful of Venugopals critics within the medical fraternity even go to the extent of picking holes in the pioneering heart transplant effort that put both Venugopal and AIIMS on the global map. It was, they claim, a senior doctor in Venugopals team who had performed the hands-on surgery, while Venugopal, as the senior, had merely watched on. 

 The doctor, who now works with a leading private hospital in the capital, was cautious when contacted by The Telegraph. He was a wonderful mentor, and I dont want to be dragged into the controversy at this juncture, was all he would say. 

 Nevertheless, the tongues continue to wag. And while the health minister is nobodys favourite either, many within the critics lobby are relieved at the fact that Venugopal has been cut to size. But that isnt quite the opinion shared by Venugopals supporters, who have struck work yet again and are sitting out on a hunger strike within the institutes premises. Venugopal is the emblem of the autonomy of AIIMS and we have resolved to stand by him and save the institute, says B.K. Khaitan, an AIIMS doctor at the helm of the protests. 

As for Venugopal, the long and winding court proceedings 

have just begun. And the man will perhaps be hoping he can speak his heart out 

to the extent of influencing the jury. That could be difficult, for oration is 

a skill not naturally granted to people. And Venugopal seems to be horribly out 

of practice.

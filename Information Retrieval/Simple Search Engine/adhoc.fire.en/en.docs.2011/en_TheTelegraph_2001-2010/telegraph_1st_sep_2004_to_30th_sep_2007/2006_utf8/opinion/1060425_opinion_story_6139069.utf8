 IN NEED OF EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the United Nations World Water Development Report 2, 2006

 Much has been made of the digital divide, the uneven distribution worldwide of communications technology and access to, and use of, information. The UN has responded to this by creating the ?Digital Solidarity Fund? in March 2005, intended to enable people and countries presently excluded from the information society to gain access to it.

 Initiatives proposed include the construction and operation of regional telecentres where people have access to computers, the internet, telephones, and so on. Over and above this, the many applications of satellite surveillance and modelling can have substantial potential in water resources monitoring in lower-income countries... At the same time, focus needs to be placed on basic knowledge and capacity-building...Disadvantages, however, may include increased water scarcity and pollution, if water demand and pollution control are not carefully managed...

 Countries with poor or weakly enforced environmental regulations which allow pollution (air or water) to flow across international boundaries are of great concern...In some countries, there are moves to divert water from the production of low-value staple crops to higher-value cash crops such as vegetables, fruit and flowers. As exporting grows, there are concerns that the rules of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) increase environmental risk due to their restrictions on the use of the precautionary principle.

 Several critics of these organizations? rules argue that WTO, for example, has always put the interests of commerce before environmental protection. This may lead to countries bound by these trade rules to agree to bulk exports of water to other countries against their wishes...

 Technological innovations and water technology can offer significant opportunities for the water sector. In water treatment, membrane technology is an example. Membranes are manufactured filtration systems that can separate a wide and growing range of substances...which are present in water, from the water itself...

 The Precautionary Principle, adopted by the UN Conference on the Environment and Development (1992), states that in order to protect the environment, a precautionary approach should be widely applied, meaning that where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage to the environment, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.

 ...The potential benefits are good, as local management should better understand the...demands of the situation. A degree of competition between local authorities can stimulate innovation while cooperation between stakeholders can be improved (World Bank, 2005).

 The downside in practice is that many governments transfer water management responsibilities to a range of subnational entities that lack the capacity and resources to cope. Also there are larger-scale issues in water management that cannot readily be dealt with at the local level ? allocations, pollution control, storage and others. Administrative areas may not coincide with river basins and watersheds. They may overlap adjacent basins, or several administrative units may share a basin. 

 Some communities undergoing rapid socio-economic development may find that membership of community management arrangements is unpopular, as people see no long-term advantage in participating...

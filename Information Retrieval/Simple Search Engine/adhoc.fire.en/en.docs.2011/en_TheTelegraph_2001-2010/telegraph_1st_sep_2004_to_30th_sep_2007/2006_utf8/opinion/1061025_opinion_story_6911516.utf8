 SEAL OF CONTROL

 The strangest fate has befallen the National Film Awards this year. The jury has sent in its judgments in sealed envelopes. But these must remain unopened with the information and broadcasting ministry until a curious legal problem is sorted out. Recently, the Bombay high court had ruled that digital-format films mostly documentaries should be eligible for the national awards without censorship certificates. This had reversed an old rule, enforced by the government, that although uncensored feature films may be shown at festivals, and were eligible for the national awards, documentaries had to carry censorship certificates. Yet, in spite of the recent Bombay high court ruling, the court has learnt that the uncensored non-feature films were not considered for the awards. Hence the courts stay order over the announcement of the jurys decisions. The I amp;B ministry could appeal for the lifting of the stay order, and the court still insist that the ministry change its stance on non-feature films, but the stalemate will continue until this is resolved one way or another.

 What does all this amount to for the Indian democracy? Independent creativity and with that, the right to political critique remains mired in mindless bureaucratic conservatism and a deeply entrenched discomfort with letting go of State control and vigilance. Hence, censorship becomes an essential element in the States patronage of cinema. The question may be posed in another way. Why should cinema become the ground over which the judiciary and the executive play out their conflicts regarding constitutional checks and freedoms? More fundamentally, why should cinema remain, through a kind of residual socialism, the object of State patronage and control in a modern and mature democracy? In the sphere of documentary film-making, the career of somebody as eminent as Anand Patwardhan has been shaped, to a very great extent, by a sustained and active resistance to this will to censor and control. The fact that such a film-maker has to petition the court to be able to express himself freely in his chosen medium says something rather alarming about the Indian polity. The National Democratic Alliance government was unabashed in these matters. Its Congress-led successor, though less obviously bigoted, remains quite as archaic in its attitude to creative and critical freedom.

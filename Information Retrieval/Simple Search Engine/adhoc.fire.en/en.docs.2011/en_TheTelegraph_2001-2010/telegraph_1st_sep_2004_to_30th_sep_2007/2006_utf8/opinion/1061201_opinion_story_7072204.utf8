 Sinful act

 Sir Ashok Mitra in his article, A very special act (Nov 27), seems to imply that India is under military rule. The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act was the creation of the Jawaharlal Nehru administration and was summarily imposed on the Naga insurgents. Subsequent governments not only retained this act but also enlarged its ambit to cover the entire North-east. Thus a fundamental political and socio-economic issue has become one of law and order. There is little point in blaming the army. New Delhi should be forced to rescind this act, especially now that the Jeevan Reddy committee has recommended its repeal. 

 The decision should be hurried, given Manipurs geo-strategic importance. Moreh, on Indias border with Myanmar, is the starting point of the Kunming Initiative highway. A strife-torn Manipur cannot provide an environment conducive to this change. The whole of North-east awaits a massive politico-economic transformation. It will be far more fruitful to work on this rather than on Kashmir.

 Yours faithfully,

J.K. Dutt, Calcutta

 Sir The disturbance in Manipur and the rest of the North-east is not because of the AFSPA. I have travelled extensively in the region during the past one year and think that the north-easterner has been given all that is required to succeed in India. The insurgency and sullenness we encounter there are outcomes of a collective lethargy which has taught the people that an aggressive stance would ensure a steady flow of funds from New Delhi. In fact, no matter how hated the act, AFSPA is not only an absolute necessity for Manipur, but also for the entire region. The conclusion that the legislation is responsible for insurgency is to put the cart before the horse.

 Yours faithfully,

Arun Bhagoliwal, Guwahati

 Sir In A very special act Ashok Mitra takes a look at an issue that has its inception in the confusion that reigned supreme in the early years of Indias life as a nation-state. The people at the helm of affairs in Delhi spare little genuine thought for the North-east, caught up as they are in trying to retain control over the cow-belt. The army personnel, on the other hand, have taken full advantage of the powers vested in them by the AFSPA and have resorted to inhuman atrocities in Manipur. The government urgently needs to better the lives of the people of Manipur. They do not deserve army rule. If India fails to integrate the region with the rest of the country, Manipur will end up becoming another Kashmir. Instead of devoting funds for new defence policies, it is time the authorities gave serious thought to the internal strife and loss of life that are being caused by its army in the North-east.

 Yours faithfully, 

Shubhashis Chowdhury, Ashoknagar, North 24 Parganas

 Hold your tongue

 Sir The decision of the Tamil Nadu chief minister, M. Karunanidhi, to use Tamil in the Madras high court is a retrograde step for India in times of globalization (Only Tamil in high court, Nov 23). Our politicians, instead of creating the right environment for multinational ventures, are busy getting cheap popularity by either forcing the regional language on courts or by changing the names of various towns and cities. They do not realize that such measures could lead to the balkanization of the country. One hopes that good sense will finally prevail. 

 Yours faithfully,

Ashok S. Mehta, Calcutta 

 Sir The courts in India should not opt for regional languages in their proceedings. English is an international language and should be used for the sake of uniformity. The example set by Karunanidhi may provoke other states to follow suit, which would make matters worse. The Centre should inter- vene to stop opportunistic politicians from dividing the country any further .

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, Calcutta

 Sir In the days of globalization, English is definitely necessary in day-to-day proceedings of the courts. Karunanidhis move to introduce Tamil in the Madras high court is only designed to appease a few hardliners who are not comfortable with English. To discontinue the use of English in law courts is to shut out the window to the world.

 Yours faithfully,

Kumarish Chand, Burdwan

 Sir M. Karunanidhi is trying to build up another movement in the name of the Tamil language. Is he not flogging a dead horse? Will the fight for Tamil have enough steam in it to ensure the political success of his son, who, quite definitely, lacks his acumen?

 Yours faithfully,

S. Sikdar, Calcutta

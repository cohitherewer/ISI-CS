 TIME TO LOOK BACK WITHOUT ANGER

On the eve of another birth anniversary , both India 

and Pakistan should perhaps consider ways to end the bitterness and move on, says 

Jyoti Malhotra... 

 Shake hands and make up

 The tit-for-tat expulsion of an Indian and Pakistani diplomat each over the weekend clearly signifies a new low in the bilateral relationship. What is worse is the media spin being put on the story, which, in fact, makes out the situation to be much worse than it really is. 

 Moreover, analysts and former diplomats (mostly the latter, in their new avatar as analysts) are already contributing hardline views to the incident, thereby feeding into the already pugnacious attitude of the establishment that would like to give the Paks a bloody nose. 

 And so, once more, in the week before India and Pakistan turn 59 a time when both should have been able to look back with some amusement, some chagrin, at their tumultuous lives truth becomes almost a casualty of the peace process. If you are not with me in my version of the story, both sides are loudly saying, then you are clearly against me. 

 True that Deepak Kaul, visa officer in the Indian high commission in Islamabad, was driving to the India-Pakistan border at Wagah on Saturday, when his car was stopped 90 km from Islamabad. Both sides agree up to this point. From hereon, the story diverges. 

 According to the Indian side, he was stopped, put into a car, taken to an undisclosed location for five hours and interrogated. According to the Pakistani side, he was stopped on his way to meet a Pakistani contact, diplomatic parlance for a local spy, was caught red-handed, taken back to the Pakistani foreign office and handed back to Indias deputy high commissioner in Islamabad, T.C.A. Raghavan, around 12.30 pm on Saturday. 

Neither side, not even the Indian side, claim 

that Kaul had been handcuffed, and yet this detail was prominently displayed by 

some Delhi newspapers the next morning. 

 As for the Pakistani side, which denies that Kaul was interrogated, there is no word yet on what they did with the Indian diplomat till 12.30 pm, when he was handed back to the Indian deputy high commissioner, that is, for a full five hours. 

 Perhaps the Deepak Kaul-Rafiq Ahmed (the Pakistani diplomat who was expelled in retaliation from Delhi) incident is a perfect metaphor for this independence/Partition week. Two ageing twins, separated at birth almost sixty long years ago, should have been able to make their own trysts with destiny by now. Instead, we seem content to be trapped in a mirror of half-truths, half-insinuation, where any attempt at acknowledging our past errors is demonized by our own sides. 

 Put it down to the Mumbai bomb blasts of a month ago. Or the Varanasi blasts a few months ago. Or to Kargil before that, perhaps to the three wars fought over Kashmir even before that. Actually, if you want to start at the beginning, perhaps you could begin with Partition. Some historians would argue that the beginning did not take place in 1947, but in 1935, when the British held separate elections for Hindus and Muslims in an attempt at dividing and ruling over the spoils of power. 

 Going back to the beginning of time, to the so-called original sin, is a favourite Pakistani pastime. A lot of it starts with Partition, when M.A. Jinnah is allocated a moth-eaten, truncated country, which does not even include that most beautiful place on earth, the Kashmir valley.... And hence the heartburn through the next six decades, until we arrive at the latest massacre in Mumbai, this time via RDX and the hidden hand in seven, first-class train compartments. 

 To say it like it is that must be the journalists first commandment. If Mumbai was the handiwork of the Lashkar-e-Toiba, masterminded by Pakistans intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence, then Pakistan must know what it is that India feels. A Pakistani denial, by its establishment as well as by its media, a chorus of give us proof, only adds both insult and humiliation to the bloody injury that is right there for all to see. 

 Deepak Kauls handcuffs, or their lack, are another case in point. So is the army in Srinagar, which about ten days ago, went to town over the discovery of a slain terrorist in the Gurez section of Kashmir, which it claimed was that of a Pakistani Major called Hyder Turki. The Srinagar spokesman even knew which regiment he was from, the 9 Baluch Battalion. Forty-eight hours later in Delhi, the story came full circle, when the army spokesman in the capital denied that the dead body of the terror- ist belonged to a Pakistani armyman. Clearly, the army headquarters deserves full marks for reclaiming its largely upright reputation. 

 And so it goes, in this anniversary week of independence/Partition. Perhaps it is a blessing that many of us who experienced that nameless terror of 1947 are hardly alive to tell the tale although Margaret Bourke-Whites chilling pictures in Rolis newly released edition of Khushwant Singhs Train to Pakistan are a fresh reminder of the horror that we unleashed upon each other. And continue to do so till today. 

 The other noteworthy aspect of these past almost sixty years has been the fact that, at least in the public eye, there are only two sides to the India-Pakistan story. In both countries, you can either belong to the candle-burning brigade at Wagah, or to the masculine lets-give-them-a-bloody-nose group. 

 Truth is, neither the direct, sensory experience of Parti- tion nor the memory of its trauma, can be so black and white. To most victims who directly or indirectly account for large parts of north India lighting a candle at the border is an unnecessary, somewhat pretentious act. On the other hand, many acknowledge that hating the Mussalman, however satisfying, is hardly the point. 

And so in this sombre week, while we celebrate 

our independence, it might be time to consider closure, and move on. Perhaps the 

media in both countries should stand up and show the way. And as a sign of the 

times, accept the truth behind the Mumbai bomb blasts as well as the falsity of 

Deepak Kauls handcuffs.

 THE CHAIRMAN IS WATCHING

 SHOT IN THE DARK

 K.J. Rao?s rechristening is an indication of Mao Zedong?s place in the Bengal communist pantheon

 The opening of the doors for capitalists in West Bengal must be an indication that Mao Zedong is no longer the reigning deity for our Bengali comrades. The Indian government, which is now propped up on its ?Left leg?, has already trained its gun on the ?Mao?-ists, treating them as internal terrorists. The left supporters too think perhaps that Chairman Mao has only inspired wayward elements in communist politics. The vilification of Mao is now almost complete. 

 Another gentleman is also villain to many, and hero to the rest, in West Bengal at this moment. He is K.J. Rao, the Election Commission?s special observer in West Bengal. A few ingenious individuals of Midnapore came up with the bright idea of decorating their Saraswati puja pandals with life-size cut-outs of Rao. But ? surprise, surprise ? he was depicted as ?K.J. Mao?. 

 This new-age Mao is not the hero of any cultural revolution or a harbinger of social equality. To the supporters of the ruling CPI(M), he is an agent of the opposition, fighting a fake crusade on the latter?s behalf. His stern monitoring of the electoral roles all over the state has been portrayed as a witch-hunt, conducted in order to unseat ? nay, merely to make a dent in the vote share of ? the Left Front. 

 Rao has been in the bad books of the left since his supervision of the Bihar polls ensured the defeat of the Lalu Prasad-Rabri Devi government. The CPI(M) had allied with Lalu Prasad to keep the non-secular Janata Dal (United)-Bharatiya Janata Party from coming to power. Now on a mission to clean up West Bengal, Rao has raised the hackles of the ruling left combine, which has for long prided itself on its electoral machinery. 

 Where does Chairman Mao stand in all this? His economic doctrines have long been consigned to the text books, but what is truly amazing is the recent trend to identify everything which stands contrary to the convenience of the left with Mao. The bane of the leftist establishment in Bengal?s districts are the ?Maoist? communists. And now, it is the turn of Rao, who has caused maximum inconvenience for the Bengal leftists before the polls. 

 Given the way things are, one wonders if Chairman Mao?s picture still hangs on the walls of Alimuddin Street. And if it does, don?t the comrades secretly wish he were not a part of their history? Or are the Marxists of this state waking up to a history lesson learnt too late, remembering Khruschev?s accusation in the late fifties that Mao was straying from the Marxist doctrine? Or should we blame it all on the evolution of the left in the state through electoral compulsions? After all, fighting against an ultra-left which identifies itself with Mao?s ruthless ideology cannot be easy.

 In his Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan, Mao writes, ?A revolution is an insurrection, an act of violence by which one class overthrows another.? The neo-left of Bengal, which harps on its IT strength, and has recently succeeded in capturing a major chunk of the urban middle class vote bank, will not find the words to its liking. What is the use of a revolution when elections can be won?

 Trouble is, Mao?s present-day followers ? and who knows, maybe Mao himself ? are keeping a close watch, lest the ruling comrades stray too far.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 TOO TIMID

 There are occasions that seem to call for celebration but in fact should call forth the opposite. The announcement that the Asian countries have won the bid for the cricket world cup in 2011 is one such occasion. This should not lead to jubilation, at least in India. The reasons are very simple. Of all the countries that play cricket in Asia, India is the biggest. This is not only a reference to India?s geographical size. The size refers also to the population that follows the game, to the advertisement revenues that can be tapped and also to the number of venues available for hosting matches of international standing. None of the other countries can match India on any of the above criteria. This is obvious. India thus has no need to collaborate with the other countries to host an international cricket tournament. It can do so on its own. The other countries need India since they do not have the wherewithal to host a world cup on their own. India seeks their collaboration because it believes that it needs their votes. The assumption is that India, unless it forms a united front with the other Asian cricket playing countries, cannot secure enough votes to ward off competition. This only indicates India?s lack of confidence. It is also suggestive of the lack of tactical and persuasive skills of those who represent the Board of Control for Cricket in India.

 This failure of confidence is not confined to the world of cricket. It is visible in politics and other spheres as well. India ? or more correctly Indians who represent India in various international fora ? fails to project itself as a global player capable of holding its own in any given field. India suffers from a bizarre third worldism and constantly sees itself as a laggard. Negotiations are invariably marked on the Indian side by deference and diffidence. This is unwarranted and shameful. What is worse is that there was a time under Jawaharlal Nehru when India saw itself as an important player in world affairs. India seems to have retreated from that position despite its economic advance. There was also a time under Indira Gandhi when the voice of India rang out with confidence and pride. That too has disappeared somewhat inexplicably. Thus India is happy to host a world cup in collaboration with Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh when India?s status demands that it stands on its own with its held high on the world stage.

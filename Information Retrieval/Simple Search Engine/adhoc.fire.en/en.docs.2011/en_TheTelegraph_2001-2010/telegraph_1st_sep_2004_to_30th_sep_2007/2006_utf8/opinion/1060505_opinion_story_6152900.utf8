 Without reservations

 Sir ? The demonstration by medical students in Delhi against the government?s reservation policy was uncalled for (?Quota clash at Arjun door?, April, 27). It is common knowledge that Dalits and other backward classes have been discriminated against, and reservations in higher education and the private sector are one way of empowering them. Since it is important for these people to raise their economic status to be on a par with the more advanced sections of society, no one should object to reservations. In fact, one ought to advocate reservations in all sectors, including sports. For instance, there should be a 50 per cent quota for OBCs in the Indian cricket team. This will enable them to partake of the fortune made by cricketers. There should be a similar percentage of reservation in the other sports. It is unfair that the top position in Indian chess is occupied by Viswanathan Anand, who is an upper caste. This anomaly can be rectified if the sports ministry allows only members of the backward castes to participate in international chess for the next decade. Other sectors which need the same attention are the film industry and civil aviation.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The police action on a section of the country?s most educated youth was shocking. The protest by medical students and the subsequent response of the administration bring to mind the passionate agitation against the Mandal commission during V.P. Singh?s tenure as prime minister. It is important to remember that the students are not against reservations altogether. But they feel that if reservations must continue, they must begin in nursery. This alone can ensure that deserving students from the general categories do not feel a sense of injustice at the start of their careers. If reservations happen at the primary level, backward caste students will acquire greater parity with the rest in terms of education and capability by the time they begin their professional life. Besides, reserving seats right at the nursery level would compel cash-rich and expensive schools to provide special guidance and perhaps even free education to Dalits, OBCs and SC, ST students. But everyone in these categories do not qualify for reservations. Only families that are genuinely poor and have no more than two children should be eligible for reservations.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Politicians are bent on demoralizing hardworking students. Nationwide, students across disciplines should join the medical students in Delhi in organizing protests against the reservations. Such agitations must be public and organized in broad daylight. Complaining within the confines of the private space or through online blogs will no longer do. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.Chakrabarty, Bangalore

 Sir ? In an era of competition, reservations in key sectors will rob industry and society of the competitive edge. Even the employment of a few individuals in the reserved category could be costly in the domestic and the global markets if such employees turn out to be incompetent. It is this fear that is responsible for the hostile reaction from the corporate lobby. Where medical care is concerned, incompetence could mean a national health catastrophe. However, there may be other ways to uplift the backward sections of society. The majority of the lower castes still live in the rural areas. Therefore, instead of providing jobs for them in the urban and suburban areas, the government should set up special economic zones in or close to the rural areas where they live. The government should also invest in basic education and vocational training institutes in these areas. Industrialists will start operations in backward areas only if proper infrastructure is in place. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Sir ? While Arjun Singh may think he is doing India good by his reservation policy, the reality is quite different. For one, it will surely not improve the lot of the oppressed. According to India Social Development Report 2006, brought out by the Council of Social Development, there are 260 million poor in this country. Wage earnings of casual labourers in agriculture and other public works in rural areas are about Rs 19.9 per day for females, and Rs 29.9 for males. About 25 per cent boys cannot even afford primary education. Quotas are of no use in a country where several cannot have primary education. Has the human resource development minister thought of the huge cost the private sector will have to pay for his foolhardiness? India has a substantial percentage of its population affected by diseases like tuberculosis and leprosy. Its percentage of HIV positive population is also going up. Do we have time for debating over useless policies like reservations?

 Yours faithfully,

Subhanjan Sengupta, 

 Durgapur

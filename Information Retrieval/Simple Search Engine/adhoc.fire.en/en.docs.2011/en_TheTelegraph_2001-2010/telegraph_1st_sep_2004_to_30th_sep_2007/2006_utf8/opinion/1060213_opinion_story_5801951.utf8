 THERE?S A CRUSADER IN THE LIFT

 ONE DAY IN THE LIFE OF

 A cat-and-mouse game between two graffiti artists with very different notions of beauty

 There?s a cat-and-mouse game going on in my building lift in suburban Mumbai. At one end is a graffiti artist, at the other is a crusader with an undying faith in beauty. 

 Neither has been seen, but every time a graphic design appears on the lift?s inside walls, the crusader, too, jumps into action. I tend to think of both of them as male, as they are engaged in one of those protracted, intense, endless, epic battles that only two men can be in: Calvin and Hobbes, Moby Dick and Captain Ahab, Bush and Bin Laden. But I also tend to think that if only age is the criterion, they are closer to Calvin and Hobbes than any other pair. 

 The content of our lift?s graffiti is very similar to that elsewhere, which is what appears in a boys? toilet universally. The most harmless are etchings of the names of a boy and a girl, with the inevitable ?+? sign linking them. Though they can possibly wreak havoc in the families of the ?couple?, our crusader ignores them. What he comes down heavily on are the graphic images. 

 They are usually depictions of the male genital, sometimes in conjunction with the female genital. In addition, the lift artist seems to have an inordi- nate fondness for female breasts, sometimes giant ones. But as soon as there is a new graphic portrayal of any of these, the crusader gets into the act to transform them into things of indescribable beauty. 

 One of the crusader?s most recent acts was to make a swan out of the male protrusion. The existing graffiti (or is it graffito?) became the long neck of the graceful bird, to which he added an elegant body and an upturned proud head. 

 On another occasion, just below the rectangle of buttons, there appeared a pair of breasts, symmetrically and fondly etched, possibly with the help of a compass. But the crusader couldn?t be beaten. The very next day, there appeared a giant fish on the spot, with beautifully curved, symmetrical, finely detailed scales. The fish looked as if it was smiling. 

 But the crusader?s tour de force is still on show. It?s on the lift door ? on the outside. 

 The graffiti artist, perhaps grown a little desperate (one of his high-effort complicated male-female acts was transformed into a tiffin-box), attacked the front of the door and drew a male member again, top right. Next day, the crusader had done it again. 

 In place of the frank graphic, there was a flower. It had seven round petals. It also had two round leaves, spreading out happily, if from a somewhat thick, stubborn-looking stem. The flower is still in full bloom.

 Letters to Editor

 Parental guidance

 Sir It is amusing as well as frightening to know that the mother of a boy travelling alone in an airline can get past all the security checks to see her son off (Mom takes security on merry flight, Nov 1). Remember the two air-hostesses who breached the security of the prime ministers residence? These girls were ridiculous in their stupidity, as this mother was ludicrous in her excessive concern for her child. The incident exposes the incompetence of the security regulations at airports that, apart from causing inconvenience to passengers, achieve nothing.

 Yours faithfully,

 Tuli Das, Calcuttas

 In unjust lands

 Sir What happened to Prasenjit Ghosh of Bally after he protested against the harassment of his wife by Krishnendu Halder, is a pointer to the deteriorating law and order situation in India (Protect wife and get punched, Oct 29). Just because Halder is a supporter of the ruling party in West Bengal, he could indulge in the worst kinds of atrocity and get away with them. Thus a gang of 15 men all of them supporters of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), beat up Ghosh on GT Road, leaving him grievously injured. The political connections of the CPM cadre have managed to silence those who witnessed Ghosh being beaten up. One has to be an eternal optimist to expect action against the wrong-doers. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shreya Datta, Calcutta

 Sir Cases like that of Prasenjit Ghosh have ceased to shock. Ghosh had been a fool to believe that he could complain against a CPI(M) cadre and get justice. Thanks to decades of CPI(M) rule, the laws of the jungle now prevail in West Bengal. For all the talk of progress by the government, the reality is that the state has been steadily regressing. That there is no law and order in West Bengal is proved by the fact that a protest against eve-teasing results in the complainant getting thrashed by the comrades of the accused. People like Ghosh would now think twice before locking horns with the para rogues. In this bleak scenario, the only ray of hope is provided by the media, which, by publicizing Ghoshs ordeal, brought to light the many injustices in the state.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir Women are no longer secure even within the confines of their home. Sharmistha Ghosh was being bombarded with lewd SMSes and subjected to continuous harassment by her neighbour, Krishnendu Halder. When her husband protested, Halder, instead of relenting, lodged a complaint in the local police station to frame him in a case of assault. This can only happen in a society where people with political connections wield absolute power. The common man is left with no option but to accept defeat in such cases. 

 Yours faithfully,

P.K. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir It is appalling that no one came to the rescue of Prasenjit Ghosh when he lay bleeding and unconscious on the busy thoroughfare of GT Road. Fear of hooligans patronized by the CPI(M) makes people forget their humanity. If someone had come to Ghoshs aid, who knows, he too may have been bashed up and landed in hospital. 

 Yours faithfully,

Nirupam Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir It seems that the meticulously planned eve-teasing of Sharmistha Ghosh and the assault on Prasenjit Ghosh are meant to inspire the fear of party thugs in the mind of people. But these criminals are mistaken if they bank too much on their political patrons, because such patronage is pulled away at the drop of a hat. Then these hooligans would be as vulnerable as Prasenjit Ghosh is today. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Dutta, Belur

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 THERE IS NO EQUALITY

 MALVIKA SINGH

 In all this reservation brouhaha, the one lot of people Arjun Singh has forgotten, but who need acceptance the most, are the hijras. Surely, as all groups are being ?targeted? in this rather archaic manner, ostensibly in an effort to give them a share of the mythical pie and a sense of ?equality?, hijras, sex workers, mentally and physically challenged people should also be considered for special privilege. Why the discrimination? Is it because they are not vote banks on the same scale as the rest? When Kapil Sibal spoke in defence of quality education and institutions of excellence that have to, by definition, be competitive, we had an old and infirm reaction from the ministry of human resources. Surely, affirmative action does not mean reservations. That is the intellectually lazy and administratively easy option. It exposes the sheer vacuum in thinking at the highest policy- making levels. 

 Arjun Singh should have the greatness to put a small working group together made of under fifty-year-old politicians and social scientists, with a mandate to create a time bound blueprint for the millennium. He must put his ego behind him, encourage debate and not run to the prime minister complaining about a colleague who has a mind and an opinion. We are living in an age different from the one our human resource minister is familiar with, and he must begin to comprehend that and participate in fresh dialogue. If the manner of functioning does not change, every new government or coalition is bound to reverse the decisions of the previous government, as we have witnessed in the past, compelling a stalemate on issues that need urgent redressal. This political see-saw has been responsible for the continuing discrimination, for holding India back, for forcing us to remain at the mercy of a political class aided and abetted by inept administrators. It has to change.

 Do your duty

 If the likes of Arjun Singh and his seasoned colleagues were to look at the exhausting everyday realities that citizens are confronted with day in and day out, and find solutions that are civilized, they would have done part of their duty as politicians. The government cannot even ensure that the rules it makes are adhered to, like no loudspeakers after ten at night in residential areas. It cannot stop illegalities and contraband transactions on the main roads of Lutyens? Delhi. It cannot correct its own authorities that are mandated to maintain law and order instead of being in cahoots with the corrupt nexus of the street and underworld mafia. 

 Sixty years of ?freedom? and all that we have in abundance is corruption of the mind, soul and action. Why all this rhetoric about civil society if governments cannot ensure the bare minimum for Indians in the towns and cities of this ancient and remarkable civilization? 

 In some strange ways, there are parts of rural India that are better off than the supposedly ?affluent? ones, only because they have not been polluted by endless political chatter that raises aspirations, followed by zero delivery that creates monumental problems, both social and political. 

 Unfortunately, much of what has gone badly wrong in India is the handiwork of a post-independence national leadership that exploited the patience of an economically vulnerable mass of people, bettered itself alone, and betrayed its oath of office. Today, armed confrontation, the revival of the Naxal movement are a direct result of the failure of governance at all levels of society. 

 We cannot have those who put us back into the ?dark age?, rule us today. The reins must be given to the next generation of Congress men and women who want a future that is civilized, inclusive, dignified and ethical. It is possible and fairly easy to do if there is political will.

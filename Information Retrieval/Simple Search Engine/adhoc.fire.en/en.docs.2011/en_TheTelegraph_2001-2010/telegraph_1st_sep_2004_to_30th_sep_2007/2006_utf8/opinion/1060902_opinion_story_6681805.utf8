 REAP WHAT YOU SOW

THIS ABOVE ALL -KHUSHWANT SINGH

 Family ties

Prem Kumar, son of my Dahi Bhalla friend, the 

late Kishen Lall, founder-proprietor of Hotel Rajdoot, is a very fat man. And, 

like most fat people, very jovial. He breezed in one evening carrying a bouquet 

of flowers and, as usual, sat down on the floor: my antique chairs are too fragile 

to bear his weight, and not big enough to accommodate his massive buttocks. He 

began to sing lines of a well-known qawaliwalla:

Jaisee karnee, vaisee bharnee

Na maaney to kar kay deykh

Jannat bhee hai, aur dozakh bhee

Na maaney to mar key dekh.

 As you do so will your reward be

Try it out if you dont agree,

There is heaven and there is also hell If you dont believe me

Try out death, and you will see.

 There was good reason for Prem Kumars jubilation. Some months ago, Hotel Rajdoot was raided by the police. Twelve girls, who danced in its El Dorado ballroom, were arrested for being scantily dressed and making lewd gestures. The restaurant was closed down; the girls and the other staff employed there were deprived of their livelihood. A few weeks later, the police officer who organized the whole tamasha was charged with corruption and suspended from his job. It was found that the fellow had been doing such things before, including deliberately botching up cases of murder against men who had bribed him. Maxwell Periera, once a senior police officer, wrote about him, and how officers like him confirmed the general opinion that the police was the most corrupt in our country. Prem Kumar had good reason to gloat over the downfall of the man who had done him so much harm. His belief in Jaisee karnee, vaisee bharnee had been vindicated.

 It is good to believe that everyone pays for his sins either in his life time or after his death. But it is only true for those who have a conscience to keep on the straight and narrow path of rectitude. Unfortunately, people who stray from this path and indulge in corruption, falsehood and crime do not have a conscience and do not suffer from pangs of guilt or ill-health. They manage to put aside all scruples, enjoy good health life long and enjoy the good things of life. No one knows whether or not one pays for ones sins after death. Heaven and hell are not creations of god. If there is a heaven and a hell, they are creations of human imagination to keep people frightened of consequences of evil-doings. It does not always work.

 Of sons and daughters

I have known them down three generations: Sheikh Mohammed 

Abdullah (Sher-e-Kashmir) and his lady wife, a Nedou, described as mader-e-millat 

(mother of the people), their son, Farooq, and his sister, Suraiya, Farooqs 

son, Omar, and now Suraiyas daughter, Nyla Ali Khan, settled in the US. They 

have three things in common: good looks, gift of the gab and Kashmiriyat, 

which is free from religious prejudices. I got to know them better as Suraiya 

and her mother asked me to help with the English translation of Sheikh Sahibs 

autobiography, Aatish-e-Chinar (Chinars on fire). At a function held later 

in Srinagar, I quoted an Urdu couplet which I thought summed up the dilemma of 

Kashmiri Muslims:

Farishtay bhee aayen to ijazat say aaiyen/ Yeh mera vatan hai, koee jannat 

nahin hai!

 Even if angels wish to come, they must await my permission/ This is my homeland not just some kind of paradise.

 This is how Muslims of the valley view their future. It is not shared by the majority of inhabitants of Jammu, who are Hindus, nor by Ladakhis, who are largely Buddhists, or Kashmiri Pandits, many of whom were forced out of the valley, or the Sikhs who remain. Like it or not, the bitter truth is that J amp;K was regarded as one unit under Dogra rule, whereas in fact it was three, divided along religious lines. As long as we remain blind to this ugly reality, we will not find a solution to the Kashmir problem.

 The Abdullah family are divided into two: male descendants, Farooq and his son Omar went into politics, female descendants, Suraiya and her daughter Nyla took the path to academics. Suraiya is a professor at a Srinagar College, Nyla got a doctorate in English literature from the University of Oklahoma and is currently assistant professor of English at the University of Nebraska-Kearney. She has published her first book, The Fiction of Nationality in an Era of Transnationalizing .

 Nyla examines the writings of V.S. Naipaul, Salman Rushdie, Amitav Ghosh and Anita Desai all four living abroad and looks into the aberrant behaviour of migrs from the Indian subcontinent in order to explain why they support religious fundamentalist groups in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Having settled abroad, they develop an exaggerated sense of belonging, swallow fabricated history of their glorious pasts and, despite having no intention of returning to lands of their nativity, give emotional and monetary support to subversive elements. She is objective and, despite the academic jargon she uses, highly readable.

 Delicacies from the north

 There are small towns which get known for some items of food they specialize in. On the way to Shimla, there is a tiny village, Jabli, which was known for its pedas. Everyone going up by road or rail bought a few because Jabli was known for this delicacy. Farther on, there was a family known for its achaars, both of fruit (mango or lime) and vegetables like carrot, cauliflower and turnips. They added pork and chicken to their achaars. Jablis pedawalas have shut shop. The achaarwalas fight a losing battle with big firms mass-producing pickles. Kasauli specializes in gulab jamuns, the best I have tasted. They added rasmalai as delectable as any you can find anywhere. 

 Till recently, I was not aware that they were produced by a family of halwais who are third generation descendants of the Sahus of Varanasi. They have added chana and enclosed it in a sliced bun. It is Indias answer to hot-dog or burger; belly-filling, starchy, stodgy like any American junk food. It costs only five rupees. I made my dinner out of one but do not recommend it for old people. It is the speciality of Narinder Sahu halwai, known to the locals as Tannu. He also makes a dessert known as bun gulab jamun. For good reasons I decided not to try it out.

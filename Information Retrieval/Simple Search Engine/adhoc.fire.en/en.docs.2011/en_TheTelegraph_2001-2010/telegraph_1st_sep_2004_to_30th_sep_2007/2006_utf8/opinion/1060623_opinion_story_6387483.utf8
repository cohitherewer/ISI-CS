The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 NEW ROUTE

 Each time the barrier lifts, next door seems to move even closer. This sense of nearness surged up afresh when the Poonch-Rawalkot bus rolled across the line of control to carry people over the border, bringing Kashmiris in Pakistan and India one to another. This is the second such bus; the first started travelling between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad from April last year. The reunion of families divided by an intransigent fence is a deeply moving phenomenon, and could be, for the metaphysically-minded, an indicator of how little politics has to do with people. The Poonch-Rawalkot bus service will add to the numbers of Pakistanis and Indians crossing the border to visit one another?s countries and homes, and five meeting-points on the LoC will have enclosures where divided families can spend a day with their relatives. Beyond family warmth, a truck service along the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus route would be ferrying Kashmir-specific goods as well. 

 When people want to get together, when they delight in peace and offer hospitality, troubles seem unimaginable. But the power of emotions cannot erase a stubborn and tragic history, neither can it change the realities of the present. Militancy, which has long lost touch with popular aspirations, is still a reality: whether it attacks the shelter for tourists on the eve of a historic across-the-border trip as it did last year, or frightens visitors away from the valley as politicians try to create an ambience for dialogue with extremists. The irony is that things are getting easier. People on both sides are actually getting to see one another, there are more conversations and more plans on the bureaucratic level, and, in spite of vital differences of approach, slow, incremental changes are being made in the quality of the political relationship between Pakistan and India. History cannot be changed, but it can be made, and immortality with regard to the Kashmir issue is a strong temptation for any statesman. Yet the violence nurtured for more than half-a-century for particular purposes will not just disappear when the purpose begins to change. For the people of Kashmir, the bus, the truck and the meeting-points are new and hopeful experiences. But these have not changed the older, better-known experiences of pain, loss, grief and blood, generated by both terror and counter-terror. The happiness of reunion is still edged with pathetic uncertainty.

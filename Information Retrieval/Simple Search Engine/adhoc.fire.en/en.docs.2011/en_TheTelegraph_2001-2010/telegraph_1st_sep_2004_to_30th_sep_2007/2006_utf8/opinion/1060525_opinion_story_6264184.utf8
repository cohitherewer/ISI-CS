The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 NOT IN LOVE

 When all stand-alone cinemas and multiplexes throughout a state reject good business it seems very impressive. Even if it is for the wrong reason. The chief of the Gujarat Cinema Exhibitors? Association has stated on the hall-owners? behalf that they will ban all of Aamir Khan?s films. They have made a start with Fanaa, due to be released on Friday, but they recall having to withdraw Rang De Basanti from the theatres and losing money. The exhibitors? grouses are neither aesthetic nor, it would appear, political, but purely patriotic. By siding with the Narmada Bachao Andolan activists, Aamir Khan had hurt the sentiments of the Gujarati people, because the drier regions of the state are relying on the dam to provide them with a lifeline. The actor made it worse by criticizing the state for failing to contain the riots in Vadodara and by referring back to the horrors of 2002. And he refuses to apologize to the Gujarati people for any of this. Patriotism among the hall-owners is undoubtedly laudable; it would have been even more so had there not been more than a hint of the Bajrang Dal?s prompting in the ?unanimous? decision. 

 Gujarat is proud of its image, and that image is in the attentive and tender charge of the chief minister, Mr Narendra Modi, the Bharatiya Janata Party and its closest allies. To project disinterested unanimity among cinema-hall owners ? an ideal unity of sentiment among people and the entertainment industry ? takes a feat of control that is hard to imagine in a land used to democracy. It would not do to suggest the hall-owners? decision had anything political about it ? aesthetics is an unknown concept ? or that fear of the state-approved Bajrang Dal?s violence was more important than hatred of Aamir Khan?s politics. It is pointless raising questions that have a hint of rationality. If an actor?s political attitudes are unacceptable, that is, if they do not glorify Gujarat, how can that have anything to do with his films? Again if, hypothetically speaking, a film, any film, addresses problems that have a bearing on Gujarat, will that be banned too? Neither Fanaa nor Rang De Basanti has anything to do with Gujarat. There is a moral: no actor who dares to raise his voice in protests that might touch Gujarat ? or Mr Modi ? negatively should expect his films to be shown there. It is a deeply patriotic state.

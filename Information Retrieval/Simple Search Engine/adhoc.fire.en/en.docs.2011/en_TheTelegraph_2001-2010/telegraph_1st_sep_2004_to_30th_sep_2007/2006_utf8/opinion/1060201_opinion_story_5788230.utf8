 AIR STRIKE

 Blackmail has become another name for trade unionism in India. Trade unions believe that they can hold the nation to ransom to secure their demands, and even to intervene in matters that are not their concern. The threat held out by the airport staff is a clear case in point. Employees of the Airports Authority of India have threatened to close down all airports if the government went ahead with its plans to privatize major airports. The decision to privatize airports is closely related to the urgent need to modernize airports in all the big cities. No airport in India meets international standards in terms of infrastructure and facilities. Modernization is no longer an option but an imperative. The modernization project requires massive investment. There is no reason why the state should involve itself in the project and in the raising of funds needed for it. It is not the state?s business to run airports or to subsidize their running. The decision to privatize is based on these perfectly justified premises. But the employees of the Airports Authority of India under their left leadership find it impossible to accept this logic because the unions are caught in a time warp. They continue to believe that India must be governed on socialist principles, and that the government, through various public sector undertakings, act as the principle source of financial subvention. This belief is a cover for incompetence and the absence of any kind of accountability and transparency. The threat to close down all airports is evidence of the utter irresponsibility of left trade unions.

 Privatization of airports is in many ways a test for the United Progressive Alliance government. Its outcome will send out a global signal about who is calling the shots in the government, the left unions or Mr Manmohan Singh and those who support liberalization. If the unions succeed in making the airports non-functional, the impact will echo beyond the civil aviation sector. Even worse will be the fallout if the government backs out because of the threat. The bids for privatization have been opened and the airports are witnessing agitation by the staff. The battle lines have thus been clearly drawn. The question now is who blinks first? It will not be an exaggeration to suggest that this agitation and the larger threat are the left?s last desperate throw against a historical process which has become irreversible.

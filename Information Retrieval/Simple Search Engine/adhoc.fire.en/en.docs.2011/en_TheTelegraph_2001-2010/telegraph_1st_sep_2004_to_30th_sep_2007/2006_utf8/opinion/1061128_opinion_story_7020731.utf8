 Against the wall

 Sir The attempt to scrap the anti-defacement law in West Bengal is an instance of the Left Front governments abuse of power (In this state, democracy equals powerless citizens, Nov 17). Nobody has the right to deface any property without the consent of the owner. This is another way in which the Left Fronts musclemen can hold property-owners at ransom. The power given to the public, to complain to the civic bodies and erase the graffiti at their own expense, is a cruel joke. Under the circumstances, one can only appeal to the good sense of the chief minister, to spare the city more ugliness than has already been forced on it.

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta

 Sir The draft graffiti bill has several interesting sidelights. First, it will mostly imperil the roadside houses, leaving the ones inside the lanes relatively safe thus bringing down the real-estate values of property on the main road. Second, the word non-commercial in the bill. What exactly is a non-commercial graffiti? Surely, political graffitis cannot belong to this category? Not as long as politicians and their workers are paid in cash or kind. Third, is there any limit on the number of years one party may book a particular wall? The only way a solution can be worked out is if the party which intends to use a wall pays an agreed sum to the walls owner and some form of tax to the municipality. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Datta, Calcutta

 Sir The Left Fronts decision to repeal the anti-defacement act has once again proved that the people of the state have no option but to dance to the tune of the ruling party. It is unfortunate that the people of West Bengal are ruled by a party which chooses to put its interests above that of the public. 

 Yours faithfully,

Saikat Sarkar, Calcutta

 Sir It is quite shocking to learn that the proposal to scrap the anti-defacement law has come from the chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who projects himself as the harbinger of all the good things happening in the state. How would Bhattacharjee feel if any man on the street demands the right to decide the colour of the chief ministers living room? If this persistent trend of state terror continues, then the day is not far when residential buildings will be turned into party offices on the pretext of non-availability of free land. The government will only need to pass a legislation in the assembly and legalize the act.

 Yours faithfully,

Arnab Sarkar, Calcutta

 Sir It will be one of the saddest days for West Bengal when the law-makers of the state pass the bill that seeks to legalize political graffiti. It will surely turn West Bengal into Waste Bengal.

 Yours faithfully,

Tilak R. Takhtar, Kalimpong

 Sir When the new law legalizes political graffiti on private property, there must be some provision to accommodate the willingness of the owner of the house (Private wall, public scrawl, Nov 18). The owner of a property pays taxes to the corporation. Therefore, no one has the right to deface his property without his consent. The Left Fronts proposal evinces its vindictiveness towards the Election Commissions ruling, asking all parties to refrain from graffiti on private walls. Ever since the left came back to power with a two-thirds majority in the assembly, it seems to have become totally insensitive to the peoples rights and privileges. It is strange, coming from a party which claims cultural superiority above the rest.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Mukherjee, Burdwan

 Sir There is no harm in wall graffiti as long as the municipal authorities take the responsibility of cleaning up the walls once the election results are out (Graffiti bill flouts rights, Nov 18 ). Moreover, walls are defaced not so much by election graffiti as by movie posters and advertisement pamphlets round the year. Why should the political parties alone bear the blame? The proposed bill seems to have in mind the interests of the financially weak candidates, who might find it difficult to use the more expensive substitute campaigning methods, such as distribution of T-shirts, umbrellas or saris. The non commercial advertisement bill would give a fair chance to all candidates to campaign and compete with one another.

 Yours faithfully,

Rahul Roy, Calcutta

 Sir The West Bengal government is about to endorse the dirtying of private citizens property by semi-literate political goons. It was the left which popularized the practice, inspired by the Chinese wall posters. Even the erudite communist leader, Ashok Mitra, wrote paeans to the beauty and utility of wall graffiti before the last assembly elections. On a recent visit to Darjeeling, I found a few boys competing with one another on how high one could urinate against a wall. I was very impressed and took a photograph. If I knew Ashok Mitras address, I would have sent a copy to him. He and his fellow comrades are among the few who should be able to appreciate such things.

 Yours faithfully,

Dipak Datta Roy, Bagdogra

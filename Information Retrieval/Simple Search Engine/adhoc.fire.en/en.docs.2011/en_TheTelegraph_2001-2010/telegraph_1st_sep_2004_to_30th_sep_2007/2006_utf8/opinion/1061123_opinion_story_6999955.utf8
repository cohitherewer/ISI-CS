 AS A MARK OF RESPECT

 Sudhanshu Ranjan

 The Madhya Pradesh government created history of sorts when it restored the royal title of Yashodhara Raje, a minister and scion of the Scindia family, after 55 years. On October 19, 2006, the state government brought out a gazette notification that Srimati Yashodhara Raje Scindia would henceforth be addressed as Shrimant Yashodhara Raje Scindia.

 After Independence, every Indian was considered to be equal in the eyes of law. To bolster the spirit of democracy, a circular was issued abolishing the use of Excellency. In spite of this, the practice that prevails is to prefix His Excellency with president, vice-president and governor when they are being referred to in the third person. Even the letters issued by their offices refer to them in this manner. 

 Traditionally, titles like Majesty, Excellency and Highness are used for different categories of people. Excellency refers to ambassadors, governors and bishops and archbishops in the Roman Catholic church. Majesty is used only for the king or the queen while Highness is used to address members of the royal family.

 Another practice, still in vogue from the colonial times, is to address judges of the Supreme Court and high courts as My Lord. It may be mentioned that lordship is a throwback to an aristocratic, feudal British society where family background mattered more than merit. The House of Lords had its origins in the Curia Regis (Royal Council) that was created in 1215 AD. When Edward III started inducting common men into the Royal Council, aristocrats objected to it. Therefore, a commonality had to be created and in the 14th century, the Royal Council was divided into the House of Lords and the House of Commons. The House of Lords comprised three strata of aristocrats Duke, Earl and Viscount who were addressed as My lord. Knights, who formed the lowest rung of aristocracy, were addressed as Sir. 

 Past perfect

 When India ushered in freedom, it was expected that the scars of colonialism would be obliterated sooner rather than later. In this spirit the Supreme Court issued a circular in the early Fifties, which said that judges of superior courts would be addressed as Sir or Mr Judge, and not as My Lord. It also said that Honorable would be used for the court, and not for judges. But neither the judges nor the lawyers were prepared to adapt themselves to the new democratic mores. Hence, judges are still referred to as Honourable. Their nameplates carry the prefix and, in some cases, judges themselves use it in the course of private correspondence. 

 Why do societies continue to bear some of the burdens of the past? The following anecdote may help in answering this question. Bismarck had served as the Prussian ambassador at the court of Alexander II. One day, he looked out of a palace window and was amazed to see a sentry on duty in the middle of a lawn. The general commanding the troops at the palace informed Bismarck that the sentry was posted in accordance to an ancient custom. It was revealed that one morning in spring, Catherine the Great had seen the first flower blooming above the frozen soil on that very lawn. She had then ordered a sentry to be posted to prevent anyone from picking the flower. Since then, the custom was to post a sentry on the lawn a memorial to the flower and to Catherine.

 Such is the fear of antagonizing the high and the mighty that certain practices continue to persist in a modern society, without any rhyme or reason. This holds true for India too, where the term honourable is often used to refer to ministers and other politicians. But one wonders how many of them really deserve such sobriquets.

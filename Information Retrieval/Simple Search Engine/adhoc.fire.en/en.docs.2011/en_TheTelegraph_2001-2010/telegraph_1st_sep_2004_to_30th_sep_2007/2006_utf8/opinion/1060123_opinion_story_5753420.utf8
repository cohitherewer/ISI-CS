 TAKING OVER

 The path to liberalization is not often a perfectly straight one in India. Recent developments in Tamil Nadu, for instance, look ominously like a regression to an ethos of governmental restriction and regulation which the country was beginning to mature out of. The law minister in Ms J. Jayalalithaa?s government has introduced a fresh bill in the state legislative assembly. Its formidable name establishes both the letter and spirit of the bill ? the Tamil Nadu acquisition, transfer and taking over of the administration of cable television network (including multiple service optical transport system) bill, 2006. In simple language, this translates into the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam government wanting to control the operations of specific cable TV companies in the state. This is its second attempt to do so, the first unsuccessful one having been in May, 2002. The rhetoric, this time, is that of nationalization of the distribution network for the sake of ?public welfare? ? that is, quality control and the breaking of monopoly. But given the tortuous history of Tamil Nadu?s divided polity and its internecine sordidnesses, this apparently disinterested desire to intervene will not convince many. In fact, the opposing party, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, has urgently appealed to the governor not to assent to this piece of legislation.

 Three aspects of this development are cause for grave concern. First, when privatization and liberalization seem to be fundamentally transforming the nature of governance in the country, such a move could only be deemed unfortunately against the principles of progress and reform. Second, democracy seems to be in jeopardy here as well. A government taking control of the dissemination of public information and entertainment could never bode well for either the modern state or modern civil society. Third, the AIADMK?s bill seem to be motivated by partisan interests and conflicts. The service providers being targeted have been identified with individuals linked by kinship to Ms Jayalalithaa?s rivals. It is also significant that in a few months, Tamil Nadu will have its assembly elections, therefore each party?s efforts at putting the other down will only intensify. So this would have to be a battle against unprincipledness, rather than simply opposing conservative principles of economics and governance.

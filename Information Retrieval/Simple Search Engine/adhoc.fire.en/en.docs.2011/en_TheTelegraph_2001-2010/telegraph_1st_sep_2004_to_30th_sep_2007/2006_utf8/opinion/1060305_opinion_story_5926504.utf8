The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 It wasn?t only the left that got all fired up by the Bush visit. The US president, quite expectedly, inspired the MEA officials, who were found working equally hard, although often at cross-purposes. A few hours before the arrival of the Bush entourage, they apparently told the Americans that the plane bearing a nearly 200-strong media group accompanying the president could not land in the technical area of the airport. Only Air Force One would be allowed to do that. The Americans, as usual, put their foot down, saying that the plane, though a private jet, had been hired by the US air force and was entitled to the same courtesy. After arguing for a while, the Indians gave in. There was also heartburn over the canine squad being housed in two five-star hotels, but the Americans won this round too (and even took them for a walk in Rajghat!). If the tame surrender of the self-important babus is not disconcerting enough, there is one prime example of their muddled response. Bollywood beauty Aishwarya Rai was informed of her invitation to the prime minister?s banquet for the president when she was already air-borne for Brazil, despite her plea that she be informed at least a day in advance. Maybe Bush needs to come back a second time for the left to get its message across and the MEA to get its act together.

 Didi still seems to hold the key to the political future of several people other than her partymen. Take Margaret Alva, for example, the AICC gen-sec in charge of West Bengal, who is pushing hard for a Congress alliance with the Trinamool. Last week, at a meeting held in the capital, presided over by the Bengal party chief, Pranab Mukherjee, Alva is said to have proposed that if the Congress reached an understanding with the Trinamool by which they would not field candidates against each other, Mamata could help the party get a Rajya Sabha seat from Bengal (most probably Alva?s). Not surprisingly, Pranabda remains unconvinced.

 Look South, and you have the Congress at another quizzical act. The CBI has ordered J Jayalalithaa to be prosecuted in another foreign exchange remittance irregularity, and yet the Congress-led UPA has been whiling away time for the past four months. Is this the Congress?s way to keep the DMK under pressure or to attempt joining hands with JJ? Meanwhile, the discerning have already noticed the immense reluctance of the Congress spokesperson, Jayanthi Natarajan, to criticize Amma. 

 For an organization now more and more circumspect about the power of the lotus, nipping matters in the bud is a most natural act. That is probably why the RSS found it important to abolish the post of a spokesperson for the organization. Let?s explain. It is said that this decision, taken at a recent top brass meeting in Nagpur, was aimed at removing Ram Madhav from the post, and without controversy. Madhav, close to M Venkaiah Naidu, was being seen on the TV more often than the RSS bosses? liking, and was also suspected of harbouring ambitions of making it to the BJP like Sanjay Joshi. Hence, curtains.

 A BJPwallah already out of action is Sushma Swaraj. Formerly, the party?s voice in parliament, she has left the turf to her vocal contender, Vijay Kumar Malhotra. Sushma has been missing since the time Venkaiah Naidu was party president, and the self-imposed exile continues under Rajnath Singh. Recently, when Rajnath distributed the states among as many as 36 party officials or prabharis, Sushma?s name was absent from the list. Any guesses?

 When it comes to PR, there?s no beating Vijay Mallya. Last week, the liquor baron?s visit to the home town of the Union civil aviation minister, Praful Patel, held up the Mumbai-Calcutta flight. When the king of good times finally boarded the flight, there were angry faces. Unfazed, Mallya profusely apologized to the passengers, first in Engish and then in Bengali, the best way to reach the heart of bhadraloks. 

 The PM apparently broke protocol by receiving Bush at the airport. Nehru too had received Eisenhower there, but old-timers say the ceremonial reception then took place at the airport and not the Rashtrapati Bhawan. Well...

 You have to give it to Sharad Pawar. In the wake of the bird flu scare, not only was the BCCI chief telling everyone who cared to listen not to give up eating chicken and eggs, but he was also there to demonstrate that he practised what he preached. In Mumbai, at the height of the scare, Pawar made it a point to have himself photographed while he polished off chicken legs. Back in Delhi for the ongoing budget session, he continued his crusade. While everyone around him settled for a non-poultry lunch during recess, Pawar asked for a chicken soup much to the chagrin of the waiter. Only a couple of days back, the canteen had stopped serving chicken and egg dishes at the Central Hall. But the agriculture minister insisted on being served chicken soup or nothing. The reluctant waiter informed the minister that he would have to wait till he got it from the railway canteen upstairs. Pawar complied gamely.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 COMING OF AGE

 July 1 will be an important day in the history of education in West Bengal. St Xavier?s College, Calcutta, will become, on that day, Bengal?s first autonomous institution of higher education. Founded in 1860 and affiliated to Calcutta University a couple of years later, this venerable college has long proved its ability to live up to the standards set by its distinguished alumni. So, what the occasion will mark, more than anything else, is another kind of ?coming of age? ? that of the State in Bengal and its political stakes in education. This would also throw into a sharper, and sadder, contrast, the fate of that other venerable institution in the city ? Presidency College, the granting of whose autonomy has now acquired its own fraught and ineffectual history. The phrase, ?academic and operational freedom?, is crucial to that history, and in order to make this freedom possible the government has had to amend the Calcutta University Act. So the actual forms taken by these challenged and contested freedoms, and the results, in terms of academic excellence, will be matters of interest and concern among those who have a certain vision for higher education in modern Bengal as well as rigorous standards of academic merit. It is also heartening that, having achieved autonomy, the college will aim for recognition as a university in another decade.

 The freedom to modernize syllabi, restructure examinations, ensure the proper marking of scripts, offer new subjects , experiment with interdisciplinarity and modes of evaluation are among the many prerogatives of an autonomous college. The freeing of innovation and expansion from sordidly politicized red tape and mediocrity, with priority always given to excellence, can certainly work wonders. But when the structures of higher education are in general upheaval all over India, with a great deal of cluelessness doing the rounds at every level, how the St Xavier?s model shapes up, and what the State learns from the experience, become crucial things to look out for. A form of party-driven academic trade unionism has been the main obstacle to the granting of autonomy to Presidency College, with the most grievous of consequences. The State?s role in the sad history of English teaching in Bengal?s government schools is another example of the havoc governments can wreak. It is hoped that autonomy will save St Xavier?s College from such disastrous forms of political control.

 OUT OF SCHOOL

 What looks like a choice is often necessity. In India, the language of a free market can often be misleading. When the poor prefer to buy water privately than avail themselves of municipal supplies, when they go to private nursing homes rather than to government hospitals, or when they send their children to private, rather than government, schools, they can hardly be described as making a free choice. If one wants to avoid walking for miles to get water or using arsenic contaminated water, if one wants to get cured rather than be neglected by staff or nibbled at by ants, rats, cats, dogs or swine, if one wants ones children not to drop out of school in desperate boredom borne out of dreary teaching and facilities, then opting for the private option is the result of being forced to do so, to be left with no options at all. So, such a change in behaviour among the poor is hardly a justification for the government to feel that it need not bother to think about the essential services it subsidizes.

 So the findings of a recent survey that poor parents (earning less than Rs 5,000 per month) prefer to pay more to send their children to private schools rather than send them to a free government school need to be looked at in context. If these parents have mostly wanted to be paid the money that the government spends on their children so that it could then be spent on their private education, then this is more an indication of the failure of the State than a sign of the countrys advancement towards privatized and liberalized education. The problem of quality remains unresolved, as does the nature and limits of the States involvement and culpability. But if the revival of the voucher system does ultimately result in the withdrawal of the State from primary education, it might be a good thing. But hoping that a move towards private education would force government schools to improve is an evasion of responsibility on the part of the government.

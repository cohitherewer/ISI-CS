 Extracts from Soft Drinks Hard Truths II, the report on pesticides in soft drinks released by the Centre for Science and Environment on August 2, 2006

 Quick recap: August 5, 2003: CSE releases study on pesticide residues in soft drinks.

 August 5, 2003: PepsiCo and Coca-Cola do joint press conference. They question CSE lab; dismiss our findings, say that there are no pesticides in their drinks. They test regularly. They put out adverts saying they are clean.

 August 2003: Joint Parliamentary Committee constituted to investigate the CSE findings and to examine safety standards for beverages. 

 February 2004: JPC report tabled in Parliament. It concludes: The committee recommends that standards for carbonated beverages, which are best suited for Indian conditions need to be fixed in the overall perspective of public health. The reason that other countries have not fixed such limits should not dissuade our law makers in attempting to do so, particularly when a vulnerable section of our population who are young and constitute a vast national asset are consuming soft drinks. In the committees view therefore, it is prudent to seek complete freedom from pesticide residues in sweetened aerated waters. Unsafe even if trace should be the eventual goal.

 Two processes underway: Bureau of Indian Standards begins revising its standards. The ministry of health endorses JPC report. Says it will finalize standards for soft drinks.

 What has happened since? The sectional committee of the BIS comprises of all relevant parties top government scientists, government officials (ministry of food processing, ministry of health), companies (Coca- Cola, PepsiCo) consumer and environmental groups. Committee meets 20 times in past 3 years. All issues related to standards discussed. 

 Caffeine: data on global standards and best practice. Agreed to set standards for cola drinks only at 145 ppm (200 for all currently). Revised labelling regulations.

 pH: data on global practice, [along with] data on pH of Indian drinks put before committee. Health ministry wrote saying below 2.5 not acceptable. Committee decided to adopt [the standards]. 

 Companies say:

 A. Cannot measure pesticides not true, found the committee.

 B. Cannot test complex matrix product only water and sugar. Governments test in rest of world. Companies test. Say they are safe.

 C. Cannot set final product standard governments have set pesticide residue standards for final product in other products. Consumers need final standards. Input standards cannot be regulated. 

 Companies cannot set standard because sugar has pesticides. Till sugar is tested across the country and standards revised data of over 150 samples checked. Companies supplied info. Pesticides negligible. Refined sugar used. Hot Carbon process. Pesticides not the issue. Only 10 per cent of product sugar, 90 per cent water. Water standard already mandated.

 In October 2005, committee meets in Mysore. Deliberates on all issues. Decides to finalize standard.

 In March 2006: Committee meets again in Delhi. Letter from health secretary dated same day. Says standard must be deferred. Decides to reconfirm minutes. Confirms final standards. BIS to print.

 In April 2006: BIS website says: standard finalized but not yet under print.

 In June 2006: Notice disappears . 

 February 2004: Central Committee on Food Standards meets. Endorses JPC report. Says it will set final standards.

 June 2004: Pesticide Residue Sub-Committee of CCFS meets. Decides to do year-long monitoring.

 November 2004: CCFS meets. Decides to set up National Expert Committee to study matter.

 2005: National Expert Committee meets. Decides to test samples of sugar. This will be pilot study.

 2006: Still testing. Officials say that as this is pilot study, no timeframe on when final standards will be set. But why test raw sugar, when companies use refined sugar? No answer. 

 Bottom-line: 2006 no standard

 TO BE CONCLUDED

 TIME TO ASK FOR THE SCORE

 THIS ABOVE ALL - 

 KHUSHWANT SINGH

 Pro-democracy frown?

 Recently I lost a close relative 28 years younger than me. I received a lot of letters of condolence. Among them was one from a man living in Bangalore. I have never met him but we have been writing to each other regularly for some years. His predicament is somewhat similar to mine. He is 81 years old, one of his daughters is stricken with terminal cancer and expected to die any moment. He flew over from Bangalore to Gurgaon to bid her farewell in the knowledge he will never see her again. Enclosed with his letter was a clipping of an article from a Bangalore paper written by Gia B. Dore entitled ?Letting Go: Death can be life-giving?. It is a very well-written account of how Gita let her father go when he died at 81 ? the same age as my pen-friend. She writes about him as a very loving person who was always giving. ?When the final curtain call came, he went away taking all my grief with him,? she writes. And adds, ?I was supposed to sob and cry. I was to have gone through waves of depression. It didn?t happen...He had lived his life totally and completely...He would always laugh and say, ?when I reach the finishing line, I will ask the man upstairs: ?What is my score??

 I am convinced the analogy does not apply either to my pen-friend or to me. When an old person dies, one can let him go in peace but not when the young go before their time. The old have a right to ask: ?Why did he go before me?? And the old have every right to grieve over his (or her) untimely departure. I have the same approach to the Jain belief that death should not be mourned over but celebrated. It applies to the death of an old person, someone ailing or in pain, or half-dead and in a coma; for them death is a welcome relief. But what keeps nagging one is ?Why did it happen to him and not to me?

 A poet among writers

 Keki Daruwalla (b. 1937) is a rare phenomenon among poets writing in English. He respects the lakshmanrekha between prose and poetry: he does not cut up lines of prose to different lengths and fob them off as verse; he conforms to accepted rules of metre and rhyme. He is not obscure but easy to understand. He has a wide range of them extending from the divine and the mystic of different religions down to earthly love, erotics and the bawdy, humour laced with sarcasm. He takes politics and politicians in his stride and pokes fun at them. He mixes the past and the present in his silver shaker to produce newer varieties of cocktails. All these qualities are evident in his Collected Poems (1970-2005), of which the first part is from his latest compositions. The first is his summary of the battle of Kurukshetra between the Kauravas and the Pandavas: ?We, the Kauravas?:

 We are the Kauravas, though we 

 don?t know why.

 Father was blind and mother willed herself 

 into blindness with a band across the eyes. 

 As metaphors go, you can?t beat that, can you?

 leaves you free to sink into any old manhole

 left open by the municipality.

 The other guys just asked for five villages;

 some measly thatch huts, a few cows munching away

 at the stubble and perhaps a tethered goat or two;

 and the usual paraphernalia, detritus ?

 cattleherds to graze their cows, barbers

 to shave armpits, faces and other places,

 kahars for the palanquins when their girls

 set out for the marriage bed.

 That?s all they wanted, though they ended up

 Edging us out of hearth and kingdom

 And weeping over our bloodied corpses.

 We shall always be the 

 Kauravas, mind you,

 Nothing will change that.

 Dusk will fall earlier for us, gaudhooli

 Or no gaudhooli (which if I may translate

 For Stephanians and 

 anglicized folk, means ?cowdust?.

 The second is a truly hilarious poem on present-day Pakistan and its ruler who wears many masks and uniforms: a be-medalled military dictator, president-elect of a democracy in open collared shirt, a mujahid in salwar kameez, a forward-looking man in Western style coat and tie, a backward-looking taliban in kulla and turban worn by Frontier tribesmen. The poem is entitled ?News from Osama?:

 When elections were held in Saudi 

 Arabia

 Osama Ben Laden won handsomely

 Beating Fahd and Feisel,

 And other clan chieftains hands down.

 When Prez Musharraf?s Disinformation Minister

 Brought him the news, with no 

 distortions for once,

 The President asked his ADC to 

 switch on his ?philosophic expression?.

 (The ADC had a switch for each expression on the President?s 

 face: the pro-jehadi grin, the anti-Mujahideen grimace,the 

 benign pro-freedom fighter smile,the pursed-lip pro-democracy 

 frown)

 Hearing the news, the president 

 gave a philosophic nod, saying,

 ?Osama?s victory proves that votes and terror are linked.

 You see now why our great democrats ?

 Ayub, Yahya Khan, Zia-ul-Haq

 Never trusted elections!?

 Reading and writing

 Rabri: Ka karat ho? (What are you up to?)

 Lalu: Ek dost ko chitthi likat hun. (Writing to a friend)

 Rabri: Par tuhar likhna to aawe nahee. (but you don?t know how to write.)

 Lalu: Voh sasura ko kaun padhna aawae hai? (That son of a gun does not know how to read.)

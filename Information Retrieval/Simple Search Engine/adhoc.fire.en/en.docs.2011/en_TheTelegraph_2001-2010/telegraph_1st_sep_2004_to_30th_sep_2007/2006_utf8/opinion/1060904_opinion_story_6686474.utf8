 AREA OF PROFIT AND PROBLEMS

 It would not be a good idea to allow an unlimited number of special economic zones to spring up all over the country, writes Alok Ray

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath releasing The SEZ Act and SEZ Rules

 Special economic zones are the flavour of the season on the Indian economic landscape. Following the passing of the SEZ Act last year, there is a mad rush of applications to establish SEZs all over the country. The finance and commerce ministries are locked in debates over the pros and cons of these new initiatives.

 SEZs are a reincarnation of the export promotion zones and export-oriented units developed earlier. Units set up in SEZs would be able to import capital goods and raw materials duty-free. Goods going to SEZs would be treated as deemed exports. Moreover, SEZs would be able to obtain products from the domestic tariff area without paying terminal excise duty. In other words, SEZs would be duty-free zones for exporting goods and services. However, to the extent that units set up within SEZs sell goods to the DTA, these goods will attract the standard customs and excise duties. The other advantage of SEZs is that it is easier to build world class infrastructure in small designated areas than in the entire country.

 However, the recent surge of interest in SEZs from developers (including domestic players like Reliance, Mahindras and foreign players like Posco, Nokia and sundry real estate developers from the US and Singapore) is mainly because of the facility to have tax-free incomes from developing real estates at a time when it is a booming business. This tax holiday will last for 10 years. Land prices are going up at phenomenal rates all over the country. Moreover, acquiring large tracts of land specially agricultural land by private parties is not easy in our multi-party political system. Building SEZs would be a good excuse for land grab. All state governments are anxious to prevent production and jobs going out of the state to SEZs in other states. So, the developers, with help from state governments, should be able to acquire land at concessional rates. In many cases, the developers are simply trying to buy or lease government-vested land at special prices.

 Many export units (in both manufacturing and services) would like to shift their production facilities to the SEZs as their incomes would then be tax-free. They will enjoy 100 per cent tax holiday for the first 5 years, then 50 per cent tax concession for the next 5 and a further tax break for 5 years on additional production built with reinvested profits. So, the promoters (some of them are already in manufacturing or services and they would build the SEZs around their existing production facilities) are reasonably certain of the profits they would be able to make. Besides, a large part of the land (up to 75 per cent) can be used under the laws for other purposes including building residential flats, malls, golf course and entertainment zones, which will not directly contribute to exports. Once such facilities develop in the SEZs, the value of the adjacent land already belonging to the developers would go up significantly. All these are making SEZs a highly lucrative business proposition.

 The commerce ministry only looks at the possible increase in exports and jobs arising out of the SEZs. In fact, even if there is no net increase in industrial production and only the existing units shift to the SEZs, there could still be additional employment creation in the development of malls and entertainment facilities. However, the finance ministry would not welcome such a development, since it would cause a loss of tax revenue as existing units relocate to tax havens. Besides, they are not going to get any tax revenue for many years even if additional production or exports take place. So, understandably, the North Block is not too excited.

 It is true that we need world-class infrastructure. It is also true that this can be developed more easily and at lower cost in some designated enclaves than all over the country. The initial Chinese success in exports came mainly from the foreign-owned export-oriented units set up in the coastal SEZs, adjacent to Hong Kong and Taiwan. But the Chinese practised two different economic systems one for the SEZs and another for the rest of China allowing raw capitalism in the SEZs and socialism everywhere else. The managers in SEZs were given unhindered hiring and firing rights. The workers had no job security, nor any social security benefits. This kept the labour cost in the SEZs artificially low, and gave Chinese exports enormous cost advantage. It is doubtful whether the same model will work in a parliamentary democratic system like India. 

 It would be unwise, therefore, to expect anything dramatic out of the SEZs. Mostly, existing units would relocate their operations to SEZs for getting tax concessions. The government will end up losing tax revenue without any significant rise in total production, employment or exports.

 To minimize such risks, the finance ministry wanted to set a cap on the number of SEZs. It is possible in fact likely that at least some promoters would be tempted to acquire land for creating SEZs mainly to get the benefits of cheaper land and various tax concessions. At a later point, after swallowing these benefits, the promoter may declare bankruptcy or simply sell off the land to other promoters at handsome profits. By that time, the original purpose would be simply forgotten. Similar things have happened in the past. Possibilities of land scam, in connivance with government officials and politicians, are enormous in todays speculative environment in the real estate business.

 If the tax concessions really serve to attract investment for building world-class infrastructure so essential for exports, then surely it would be a welcome initiative. But it is, by no means, certain. To increase the chances that the proposed SEZs really serve the purpose, several precautions need to be taken.

 First, the size should be large enough to permit cost reduction through economies of scale. In China, the SEZs are much larger, many of them over 10,000 hectares, whereas in India, the government is thinking of permitting services and some other sector-specific SEZs with a size of even 10 to 50 hectares. In fact, some of the Chinese SEZs were like cities which had captive power plants, own water supply and were close to sea ports and airports. This is the model which India should follow. In that case, at least, some good quality cities with high-class infrastructure will develop, even if there are no significant gains in net exports.

 Second, the developers should be reputed companies with proven financial resources and execution expertise. They should also have the clout to attract businesses to their locations.

 Third, the SEZs should be located near major ports and airports. Otherwise, the high cost of transportation will be a major hindrance to their export competitiveness.

 A major worry is that the various state governments will go for as many SEZs as possible within their states, without bothering about any of the preconditions necessary for success. Most of these would eventually be non-viable. The only beneficiaries will be the promoters, acquiring land mostly agricultural land at concessional rates and, in addition, enjoying the tax holiday on their income from construction activities. The media is likely to unearth a few land scams here and there in the coming years. But it might be too late then to undo the damage.

 - Vayalar Ravi may bring a refreshing change in Indo-US relations 

 DIPLOMACY - K.P.

 Grassroots politicians rarely fail to surprise. For many years now, the Indian establishment has gone out of its way to send to the United States of America on official visits people whose public persona resonates with the Americans. Ministers, who are on first name terms with their US interlocutors and decision-makers in New Delhi, with an old school tie that can be traced to the time they spent in an Ivy League institution, have increasingly taken over the visitors? circuit in Washington, New York and the west coast, which acts as a magnet for politicians from India because of the Silicon Valley. In recent years, even MPs visiting America have been carefully screened by organizations sending them stateside for any American connections, which are presumed to be endearing for their hosts.

 As a result, many Americans dealing with India have forgotten what Indian politicians are like and how or what they think. Because of this gross distortion, many of those in America who have recently jumped on the bandwagon of Indo-US relations, assume that the average Indian political leader is either the mirror image of many of their own or that he is a product of an American university, often with some work experience in the US.

 Most of the Indian public figures sent to America do not, in reality, any more represent the people of India. What is worse, in private discourse at least, they are more vocal in defending American interests and values than those of their own country. Which is why, the visit of Vayalar Ravi, the new minister for overseas Indian affairs, to the US last week was a refreshing change from what had become a pattern in bilateral interaction between New Delhi and Washington in recent times.

 Ravi, it was clear to Americans who rubbed shoulders with him for 10 days, has a mind of his own. Which is more than what can be said with certainty about many high profile Indians who have lately been to north America. Ravi?s independent mind may be one with which many Americans profoundly disagree, but what they learnt to respect is that he is, by no means, a blotting paper for their ideas, which are not only increasingly being questioned in the US, but also increasingly being accepted by the Indian political elite as the panacea for all of India?s ills.

 Ravi?s visit was a poignant reminder that, because of the way ministers are chosen for the cabinet these days, there are not many members of Manmohan Singh?s council of ministers who can narrate an anecdote ? as Ravi does ? about his two meetings, at the initiative of Indira Gandhi, with the widow of Salvador Allende, the assassinated socialist president of Chile three decades ago.

 The new-found wisdom in New Delhi is that someone with even the most tenuous connections with the Allende family ought to keep quiet about it because of the Central Intelligence Agency?s criminal role in getting him killed. Quite the contrary is true in Washington because Latin America is on a leftward-lurch, which is alarming the US, and Americans want an honest exchange with anyone with insights about the region who can offer a discourse on how to deal with what is a perilous issue for them.

 Chile itself recently elected a socialist president, Veronica Michelle Bachelet, whose father, an air force general, was tortured to death by the Pinochet regime which overthrew Allende.

 Americans do not want Indians or other foreigners to repeat to them as gospel truth what the state department is putting out for public consumption about Latin America. What they want is a dialogue with Indian ministers like Ravi, who can offer another point of view.

 For a change, the highlight of Ravi?s packed schedule was not in Washington, with its infrastructure for publicity back home, but in Atlanta, where he shared the stage with Andrew Young, the first black US Congressman from Georgia and America?s first black ambassador to the United Nations. Ravi made it a point to visit the Martin Luther King National Historic Site in Atlanta: few Indian politicians travelling to the US take the trouble of making that pilgrimage.

 Ravi may have done it because of his convictions or for sentimental reasons, but it is a gesture, which will bring tangible dividends for India. The Congressional black caucus has been the most difficult for Indians of all the caucuses on Capitol Hill. In recognition of America?s black community ? whose prominent representative organizations have been opposed to the Indo-US nuclear deal and has traditionally backed Pakistan on issues concerning south Asia ? India?s ambassador in Washington, Ronen Sen, has walked an extra mile to woo it. This year, he set up a prestigious annual lecture to honour the legacy of Martin Luther King. A switch in the American black community?s attitude towards India is not just a question of numbers on Capitol Hill or elsewhere across the US. It has greater significance.

 The head of the Congressional Pakistan caucus is Sheila Jackson Lee, who is also one of the most active members of the Congressional black caucus. When she switched her allegiance from the non-proliferation camp to support the Indo-US nuclear deal a few days ago, it sent shock waves through Washington?s strategic community for what it represented for Pakistan, a key client for Lee.

 V.S. Naipaul notwithstanding, New Delhi has generally ignored the Caribbean and given short shrift to its large ethnic Indian population. Partly this is because Caribbean Indians, unlike persons of Indian origin in the US, the United Kingdom or the Gulf lack money and clout back home, and a high profile. Yet, if New Delhi?s decision to set up a ministry for over- seas Indian affairs is to be fully realized in spirit, ethnic Indians in the backyard of the US ought not be ignored.

 Like his anecdote about Salvador Allende?s widow, the ease with which Ravi tells Indian Americans ? many of whom have links with ethnic Indians in the Caribbean ? about his meetings in Moscow with Guyana?s legendary Cheddi Jagan, the late president, sets him apart from most of India?s current crop of cabinet ministers. Ravi is planning to visit Indian communities in Uganda and Kenya too ? the very first time New Delhi has taken any interest in Indians in Africa since India decided to globalize itself.

 Ravi?s real test will come when he tries to operationalize his vision of a university in India for people of Indian origin. A parliamentary bill for creating such a university is in the final stages of discussion. When it is set up, the pioneer university hopes not only to be home to ethnic Indian students from all over the globe. It is also aiming to bring teaching and research talent from distant shores to a new house of learning, which Ravi wants to showcase as an educator?s version of the new India.

 The ministry for overseas Indian affairs has already contracted with the American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin, the most powerful Indian lobby in the US, to tap the resource and knowledge base of Indian doctors in America to bring healthcare to rural India. Ravi announced at an AAPI convention in Atlanta that Bihar and Andhra Pradesh have been chosen for pilot projects under this arrangement.

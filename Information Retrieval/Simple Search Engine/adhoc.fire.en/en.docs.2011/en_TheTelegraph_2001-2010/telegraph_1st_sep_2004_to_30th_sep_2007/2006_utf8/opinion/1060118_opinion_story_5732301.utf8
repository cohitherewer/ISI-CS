 THREATENED PEACE

 The politics of violence has a tendency to degenerate into banditry. Their professed political creeds notwithstanding, several insurgent groups in the North-east often function like criminal bands. The latest evidence is the Rs 500 crore extortion threat that the United Liberation Front of Asom has issued to the Oil and Natural Gas Commission. This is not the first time that the Ulfa has slapped an extortion threat. This may not be the last either. What makes the latest threat remarkable is the huge sum of money. But the timing of the threat has more important dimensions. It has come even as a civil society group, whose members were handpicked by the Ulfa, is negotiating peace with New Delhi. For some time, the members of this group had been insisting that the army and other forces suspend their operations against the Ulfa in order to promote the peace negotiations. The threat shows once again the insurgent group?s true colours, if such evidence was necessary at all. It puts a question mark on the Ulfa?s real strategy for the peace initiative. More important, it suggests how unwise it would be to suspend the counter-insurgency operations in the state. The peace negotiators chosen by the outfit should know better before pleading for a ceasefire by the government?s forces. They need to persuade the Ulfa first that extortion threats and violence do not lead to peace. 

 For the people of Assam, there is a different road to peace and socio-economic progress. Mr Manmohan Singh pointed to that road ahead when he announced a Rs 6,000 crore development package for Assam. Ironically, the prime minister?s announcement came on the same day as the Ulfa?s threat to the ONGC, which too had earlier announced another Rs 3,000 crore package to upgrade its oil and gas fields in Assam. The militants? extortion threat is thus in clear contrast to a new promise of the state?s economic revival. If the militants gain anything from such threats and violence, that can only be at the expense of the state and its people. It is not enough for the Centre and the state government to battle the insurgency. The democratic political parties and other institutions have a big stake in defeating militancy. Secret deals with the militants are not the answer; the politicians must come clean and unequivocally condemn the Ulfa?s subversive ways.

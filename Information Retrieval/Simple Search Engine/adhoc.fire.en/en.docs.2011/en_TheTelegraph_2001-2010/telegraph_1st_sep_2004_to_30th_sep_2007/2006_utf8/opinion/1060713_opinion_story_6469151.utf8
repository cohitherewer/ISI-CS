The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DAILY TRIP

 The killers are punctual: there is a grim regularity ? and almost casual coordination ? in their hits. This time, they killed tourists and commuters in two of the most badly-hit spots in India on the same day ? if a country so vulnerable to terrorism can be said to have any especially inviting locales. Tourists were hit by grenades in Srinagar, just as they had been at the end of May. That had followed another attack on tourists a few days earlier. These killings are just a few among others in Jammu and Kashmir, some recent ones being those of 14 pilgrims and migrant workers, and of 35 villagers in Doda and Udhampur. In Mumbai, the death toll of the horrific seven blasts in the first-class compartments of local trains travelling the Western Line is still mounting. This is the only city in the world that has been subjected to two such devastating terrorist strikes, the first in 1993, with five explosions in between. Throw in the blasts in Delhi, Varanasi and Akshardham in Gujarat just as a sample, and add the killings put down to ultra-left organizations throughout the country, and India becomes one of the favourite targets of peacetime violence in the whole world.

 The killers are punctual, the information about them is not. How is intelligence failure of such a scale and such regularity possible? If terrorists can get away with multiple hits on the same day at two places with techniques used successfully here and abroad, it is time some people lost their jobs. Should there not be a few resignations too, beginning with the Union home minister?s? An administration that has repeatedly failed to protect defenceless citizens against different organizations must be doing something terribly wrong. It is now up to the citizens to demand that the administration does its job of predicting and preventing terror strikes, and of relentlessly pursuing and punishing the killers. 

 Oddly enough, the fact that India is so acutely vulnerable to terrorism seldom seems to disturb its friends in the West. The much-reported anniversary of the London blasts is a reminder that those tragic deaths were felt like a knell of the civilized world. Somehow the innocent dead in India do not have such an impact, perhaps because many of the killers are nurtured in a country important to the United States of America and its allies for geopolitical reasons. The criminal behind the 1993 Mumbai blasts is ensconced in Pakistan. But with a kind of smooth obscenity, the Western media find it more important to laud Mr Pervez Musharraf for his expressed sorrow at the devastation in India rather than focus on the horror of the events. It is up to India to change perceptions, and to proclaim, through words and action, that compromise means defeat in the war against terrorism, which in the end will affect every nation.

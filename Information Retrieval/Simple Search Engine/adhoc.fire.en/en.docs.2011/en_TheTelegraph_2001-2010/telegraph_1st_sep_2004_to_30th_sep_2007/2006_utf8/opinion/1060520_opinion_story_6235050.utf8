The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Pleasant surprise

 Sir ? I have been a subscriber of the landline service of Calcutta Telephones for the past 30 years. The service provided by the telephone company has been by and large satisfactory during this period. Even then, given the ill-reputation of the service provider, I was pleasantly surprised to find my complaint being addressed within a couple of hours after it was lodged. If only Calcutta Telephones would provide such prompt service always, subscribers who have switched over to other service providers would surely renew their connections with their old favourite.

 Yours faithfully

 A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

 All work, no rest

 Sir ? It is a pity to note that the Board of Control for Cricket in India is hell-bent on turning our cricketers into commodities for the cause of sporting glory (?Gladiators out of athletes?, May 9). Some have argued that the players should not be grumbling about the number of matches being played, as representing the country is a matter of great pride. But they should also remember that cricketers are not machines. Like any other professional, they also suffer from fatigue after playing under taxing schedules throughout the year. 

 Taking care of one?s own health is not a crime. Therefore, our cricketers cannot be blamed for being worried about burning out owing to their hectic schedule. The board should allow the cricketers to speak about their problems and assure them that it would not penalize them for airing their views. Unfortunately, the truth is that our board is full of petty-minded individuals who are loath to see cricketers speaking up for themselves.

 Yours faithfully, 

H. Sinha, Korba, Chhattisgarh 

 Sir ? It is a good idea to play competitive cricket all the year round as it generates revenue, provides cheap and wholesome entertainment, and unites the entire country. However, care should be taken to ensure that players do not play too many matches. The board should work out a policy of rotation whereby all players would have to sit out for an entire series every year. For example, if there are four major fixtures planned in a season, a set of four players comprising two batsmen and two bowlers should be rested for each tour. This will not only give our cricketers a much-needed break, but it will also give talented newcomers a chance to prove their mettle on the international stage.

 Yours faithfully, 

Shashi Luthra, Calcutta

 Sir ? In India, cricket is more of a lucrative business and less of a game. And it is our cricket board, flush with money from various sources, which is the king of this enterprise, and not the players, Virender Sehwag had recently stated that the Indian team sometimes misses the former skipper, Sourav Ganguly. He also added that cricketers were playing too much cricket nowadays. The board secretary, Niranjan Shah, first issued a warning to Sehwag, only to renege on his words and clarify that the player had not been warned but merely advised not to talk about ?other players, selection and BCCI policies?. What is surprising is that none of the cricketers raised objections about the board?s high-handed ways. Is it because Indian players value money more than their self-respect? 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir ? The BCCI wants to fill up its coffers by forcing a tough schedule on cricketers. The board must realize that it would not be wise to exhaust cricketers by making them play too many matches. Rather, the players should be provided with ample rest to recover after each series so that they can enjoy a prolonged career which in turn can be profitable for the board as well.

 Yours faithfully,

 Anirban Rudra, Calcutta

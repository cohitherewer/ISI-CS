 Letters to Editor

 Going nowhere

 Sir The joint anti-terror mechanism involving India and Pakistan is now in place and a committee comprising three members from each country will start functioning soon (Test of joint terror group, Nov16). This is perhaps the first time in history that a victim of terrorism is joining hands with the perpetrator to find a solution to the problem. The two sides have also decided to share intelligence to curb terrorism. This means that Indian intelligence agencies will now have to provide sensitive information to Pakistans Inter-Services Intelligence. This would be a boon to the ISI as from now on it would not have to spend a fortune to lay its hands on sensitive information. 

 Perhaps, the United Progressive Alliance government should think of setting up a similar mechanism with outfits like the ULFA and the Maoists to bring peace and stability. If such a measure were to succeed, the UPAs name would be written in gold in the pages of Indian history.

 Yours faithfully,

S.B. Gupta, Calcutta 

 Sir The recently concluded secretary-level talks between Shiv Shankar Menon and Riaz Mohammad Khan have not resulted in substantial gains for either side. The two foreign secretaries have merely wasted their precious time by participating in this futile exercise. After the Mumbai blasts, Indian officials had raised a finger of suspicion at Islamabad. Some of them even stated that there was concrete evidence regarding Pakistans involvement in the blasts. Why then did India fail to hand over the evidence during the talks between the two foreign secretaries? The Centres handling of the issue is nothing but a proof of Indias timidity in bilateral affairs. If this attitude persists, even a hundred rounds of talks between the two countries will not produce anything conclusive in Indias favour.

 Yours faithfully,

J.B. Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir The fact that India and Pakistan have now decided to tackle terror together is good news indeed. However, India should be wary of Pakistans intentions. The government must not forget that Pakistan has always helped terrorists and secessionists who are hell-bent on destroying India. It is quite possible that Pakistan will hand over the intelligence provided by India to terrorist organizations. This would help the terrorists to make their plans full proof, thereby making it impossible for the security agencies to foil their evil designs. 

 Not just Pakistan, but China has been claiming parts of Indian territory for sometime now. Scholars in that country have also extended their support to such dubious claims. Perhaps, India should also make Indian scholars swear that Tibet was once a part of Akhand Bharat. As for Pakistan, we need to go back only some sixty-odd years.

 Yours faithfully,

 Water woes

 Sir In The price of life (Nov 20), S.L. Rao raises some important points. The poor in India do not have access to drinking water. A large share of the total water supply goes unaccounted due to leakages in pipelines and illegal tapping. Such wastage of this precious resource increases the cost of drinking water. It also hurts the poorer sections of the society as they often have to bribe officials in order get a regular supply of water. The remedy lies in raising awareness among ordinary people about their right to clean drinking water supply and proper sanitation.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir S.L. Rao makes a compelling case for an integrated water management system to be initiated in India. At present, there is ample scope for improving the management of water in India. It would be a good idea for the government to privatize water supply. This would ensure that the pipelines are maintained properly, wastage is minimized and that the quality of water supply improves.

 However, the government should simultaneously create a regulatory body that would monitor the tariffs households are supposed to pay for the supply of water. This should be designed in the same way as taxation the higher the income of the family, the higher the tariff band for that particular household. The government should also set up a subsidy structure and lower the tariff bands for the poors.

 Such a system would combine the efficiency of the private sector in delivering public services and the resources of the state in ensuring that the poor and the needy are not neglected in the new system. Such a system can also be implemented in a number of other areas, including healthcare and education where the rich enjoy a lions share of the resources while the poor are left to survive without the basic necessities of life.

 Yours faithfully,

Aruni Mukherjee, Leamington Spa, UK

 BIRTH OF A NEW LEADER

 MALVIKA SINGH

 A news channel had conducted what was described as a scientific survey to elect the Indian of the year and it was Sonia Gandhi. In the not-so-distant past, I recall having the most heated arguments about the private and intellectual persona of Ms Gandhi as well as the impact she has on the anonymous, real, unblemished Indian. Privileged men and women, who had made good under the regimes of the Congress, spent their social hours demeaning this strong and determined woman who had sacrificed much more than any of them and who had an unconditional commitment to India, who was genuinely disturbed by the deep-rooted problems, who recognized the unusual strengths of this polity, who comprehended the patience and resilience of those who were underprivileged. She seemed to have no time for the superficial, having been through her trial by fire. She had spent her time quietly for a near decade, remaining silent and non-confrontational. Was she was coming to terms with her reality? Was she learning, absorbing, battling with the many contradictions, and finding her place?

 Along with the unrelenting anti-Sonia banter amongst the fickle lot in urban India, with the BJP and other political dispensations and many within the Press Corps, a rather brutal and unpleasant assault was mounting. TV channels merrily beamed loutish men in politics hurling abuse at her. And what a godsend that was for Sonia Gandhi. She broke the BJP/NDA coalition and led the UPA to the treasury benches, defying the confident cry that the ?Italian? would compel the disintegration of the Congress. Speaking Hindi better than most of us English-speaking types, she took to the road, not in air-conditioned raths with attached bathrooms, and five-star catered food packs, but in a low-grade SUV, hanging out with her foot on the step board, meeting the aam aadmi. And she emphatically made her point and proved her intention.

 Three in confluence

 Those of us who believed she carried, intelligently and competently, a legacy of leadership, were called Congress chamchas. Today, all those fickle characters are speaking a new language, pompously spouting that ?she has grown?. It is quite sickening to see the privileged and educated, so chameleon-like, going along projecting half-baked ?truths? of their half-baked ?experience? of the reality and exuberance of India. Soon, the fickle breed will be on the bandwagon singing their new anthem, saluting a symbol they had spat upon. To stand exposed is a step forward because it rights the wrong perceptions in the larger scheme of politics and society. Sonia Gandhi needs to be congratulated for playing her political role with dignity, a trait of personality that almost all Indian politicians lack. 

 Yes, the people are relieved to have, at the helm, three individuals who spell dignity, integrity, commitment to India and who embody the values that all civilizations respect and only some nurture. Abdul Kalam, Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh come together as our prevailing Trimurti.

 A New Year resolution is long due from those who rule us. What better moment than this when the Trimurti comes from the same ethos, a similar ideology that is embedded in good international values. Give this subcontinent and its people a fresh lease of life. Initiate some basic societal correctives. Resolve to destroy the stranglehold of corruption and harrassment meted out by the bureaucracy. Celebrate those who are honest and who have not bettered their lives through breaking the law. Give an honest aam aadmi the Bharat Ratna and make a statement. Change the definition and colour of the national awards. Honour those who live by the book, who create legitimate wealth for the nation and themselves and fight the dogmas of ideologies that have never bettered the lot of those in penury.

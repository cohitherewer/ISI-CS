The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIRTY LESSON

 Efficiency, apparently, has nothing to do with civic sense. Anyone participating at any level to keep the incredibly huge and intricate machinery of the elections ticking deserves praise, and the smoothness with which elections have been conducted should make this praise particularly fulsome. But what is amazing is the scale and quality of the mess election officials and paramilitary forces have left behind them. It is difficult to connect the neatness and accuracy that has become associated with the election process, especially this time, with the piles of refuse ? everything from discarded and stinking food packets and sal-leaf plates, earthen and plastic cups, paper, bamboo pieces, ropes, plastic to emptied bottles of drink, cigarette packets and even half-eaten vegetables ? that remain behind as the signature of the authors of neatness and accuracy on the job. The ugliness is exacerbated by the fact that these messes have been made in universities, colleges and the National Library. Is it arrogance or callousness that makes poll officials and paramilitary staff so uncaring of their shelters and temporary business areas? Whatever the psychology, it is evidently shared by all, in or out of uniform, who used these premises temporarily. Else it would not have been possible to leave without cleaning up drunken vomit and torn-down college notices used as seat covers, broken chairs and tables, rotting food and urine.

 The phenomenon is puzzling. Accountability is not a myopic value, it is a corollary of responsibility. Officials and soldiers cannot be less responsible for the shelters they are temporarily given than they are for the duties they have to conduct. Obviously, accountability comes hard to Indians; the fear of a metaphysical rod alone can make them dutiful, but no one will be penalized for the mess they leave behind. Students, scholars, teachers and librarians can suffer: they were allowed to cast their vote in peace. No doubt they have to pay a price for their democratic right.

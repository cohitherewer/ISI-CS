 NEW LEFT

 It can be easier to win elections than to know what to do with power. The Left Front?s election manifesto can be meaningful to the people only if they see it as a realistic programme of action for making their lives better. The people are unlikely to bother whether it is a new and ?improved? left. Nor would they really care if the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has broken new grounds by fielding a large number of young candidates. The overriding question for the people is whether the left has the right policies to enable it to take Bengal forward. Fortunately, the manifesto?s emphasis is more on change than on continuity. Since 2001, the left has made economic development its electoral theme song. The focus this time is not only on new industries and urban centres but also on making farming commercially viable and creating new infrastructure. Many of these areas stagnated for years because of the left?s obfuscating politics and its refusal to accept the new economic reality. The stagnation has created an ever-expanding pool of unemployed people in Bengal. An outdated education system, controlled by ruling politicians, has only added to the unemployment problem by turning out hordes of mediocre, unemployable graduates. Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee should know how much things need to change in Bengal. But his party, the CPI(M), has to change many of its ways first if things have to change in the state fast. 

 However, no two elections are quite the same. It is true even of Bengal where the left?s reign has lasted 29 years. Between 2001 and now, the national political scene has changed dramatically. The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance is in power in New Delhi with the support of the left. But the left has used its new-found clout in national politics primarily to obstruct economic reforms. Although Mr Bhattacharjee has often struck a different note from his party bosses in New Delhi, the left has generally come to be seen as a confused group. There is little indication in the manifesto if the left has come to terms with the growing importance of the private sector in the economy. It says nothing of the left?s position on the need to open more areas of the economy to private players, both domestic and foreign. After all, Bengal cannot be immune to the changes in New Delhi?s policies. But then, elections are more about politics than economics.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 LONE RIDER

 Once a charioteer, but not twice shy. This seems to be Mr L.K. Advani?s current belief. In the early Nineties, he moved around the country on a motorized chariot to mobilize Hindu votes and public opinion. The aftermath was a new high for the sangh parivar which brought in its trail the destruction of the Babri Masjid, communal disharmony and violence. The Bharatiya Janata Party, under the leadership of Mr Atal Bihari Vajpayee, had to reinvent itself as the party of governance after trying to rid itself of the tag of Hindu fundamentalism. Mr Advani was reduced to playing second fiddle to Mr Vajpayee and was forced to advocate the programme of making the BJP a party promoting governance over ideology. Since then, Mr Advani?s political career has been on a tricky slope. He has lost trust within the BJP and also in Nagpur. His decision to embark on a second rath yatra to protest against ?minorityism and appeasement?? is an obvious attempt to revive his own political fortune and the flagging ideological morale of BJP workers.

 The overall context of Mr Advani?s second ride on a chariot could not be more different from the first one. In 1990, Mr Advani?s stridency had struck a chord among the Hindus of north India because of the prevailing atmosphere of gloom, pessimism and uncertainty. Today, that same section of the population, grown rich under the impact of economic reforms, will see a shrill Hindutva campaign as being disruptive. Mr Advani?s rath yatra may very well be self-defeating. Moreover, today, the BJP is in complete disarray. It is a house divided with no ideological or political bearings. The confusion is evident from the report that Mr Vajpayee has tried to dissuade Mr Advani from undertaking the yatra. Mr Advani?s decision to roll across the country on a chariot has produced very little enthusiasm even among die-hard sanghis. Nagpur prefers to keep Mr Advani at arm?s length after the latter?s eulogy to Mohammad Ali Jinnah in Pakistan. None of Mr Advani?s erstwhile trusted lieutenants has offered to join him in his campaign. One man on a chariot may not quite be enough to rejuvenate Hindutva?s flagging zeal. Mr Advani would have been well-advised to placate his critics within the BJP and the sangh parivar before he ventured out on a Bharat darshan. An old man trying to relive the past may not be the best thing for the future.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 White lies

 Sir ? Rahul Mahajan should have had some respect for his recently departed father even if he did not care for his own reputation (?Night of drug, drinks and a death?, June 3). No respectful son could have turned what was supposed to be a stopover en route to Guwahati, to immerse the ashes of his father, into a cocaine party. The claims made by relatives, guests, the police and hospital authorities are wildly conflicting, therefore difficult to trust till the truth comes out, if it does at all. However, what is certain is that Rahul Mahajan has closed all doors of politics on himself. The Bharatiya Janata Party has all but washed its hands off Mahajan junior. One cannot help but feel sorry for Rahul?s mother, whose story is perhaps the genuine tragedy of the Mahajan family saga.

 Yours faithfully,

Nandini Saraf, Calcutta

 Sir ? Conflicting theories and ever-changing medical reports on Rahul Mahajan suggest a big conspiracy (?Cocktail of theories?, June 4). It all seems to be part of a big game where the actual killers and/or conspirators are well-hidden while suspicion falls on others. It is well known that Pramod Mahajan was a shrewd fund-raiser brokering big deals by himself or through his deceased secretary, Bibek Moitra. However, the point is that they worked in one of the most corrupt systems in the world. Whether the facts come to light or not, people will speculate on whether money was the cause of the Mahajan family?s fall. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhash C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? Rahul Mahajan?s conduct within a month of his father?s death has exposed the decadence of ?shining? India. But the BJP?s disowning of Rahul, so as not to tarnish its own image, is quite suspect. Ordinary Indians may not be bothered by the high-society politics behind the death of Bibek Moitra and the near-death experience of Rahul Mahajan. But one does care for the truth and, therefore, would like answers to some questions raised by the incidents of June 2. For instance, why did the Apollo hospital staff seem bent on giving Rahul a clean chit on cocaine-snorting? One also wonders where Gopinath Munde?s conviction that his nephew and Moitra were poisoned comes from. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? It is well-known that in the circles of the rich and famous, partying often involves booze, drugs, sex and sleaze. The lure of the forbidden attracts only those with the wherewithal. However, in India, an activity considered taboo can always be indulged in with the full connivance of the authorities. In the Rahul Mahajan episode, it is difficult to believe that the Delhi and the Mumbai police were unaware that foreigners like the arrested Nigerians peddle drugs in various Indian cities. Must we always wait for a scandal involving a public figure for the police to act? If television news channels could reach the hide-outs of the drug peddlers to film and interview them, what could prevent the cops from picking them up? Are we to assume that, besides being corrupt, the Indian police also have a flawed intelligence network?

 Yours faithfully,

Nitin G. Gokarn, Mumbai

 Sir ? The drug abuse case involving Rahul Mahajan has held up a mirror to society and to Indian politics. It shows how the rich and famous can easily get around the law using their political connections. Equally shocking has been the BJP?s volte face. Till a few days back, Rahul was touted as a big find for the party. Almost overnight, he has become a pariah. Atal Bihari Vajpayee has, however, been kind enough to justify Rahul Mahajan?s lifestyle citing his youth and the influence of bad company. Would Vajpayee have forwarded the same rationale if the victim was a member of the Gandhi family? 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? All of a sudden, cocaine is in the headlines. While Fardeen Khan, the actor, is busy defending the purchase of one gram of the drug, Mumbai police publicize the seizure of 200 kilograms of the same. While a former prime minister excuses the mistakes of youth, pharmacology experts try to gauge the effects of cocaine on the human body. The drug remains the same, but social perceptions and actions vis-?-vis cocaine continue to vary, depending on the consumer, the law-enforcer, chemical analysts, sociologists, the self-appointed moral police and so on. This reflects the ambivalence and confusion of society. And that is owing to the lack of proper laws. In countries with stringent legal provisions, cocaine does not make news. But, in India, it makes waves. 

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? Does the story of drug abuse by a brat, whose father happened to be a controversial politician, deserve such wide coverage in The Telegraph? 

 Yours faithfully, 

Tapan Pal, Batanagar

 Sir ? What could have made the doctors at Apollo hospital change their stand on the presence of drugs in Rahul Mahajan?s system? Was it just a favour to an influential family? Or was it simply that they were incompetent? If some of the doctors and staff have deviated from the hospital?s normally high standards, it is the duty of the government authorities or those of the hospital to get to the bottom of the matter. 

 Yours faithfully,

K. Venkataraman, Mumbai

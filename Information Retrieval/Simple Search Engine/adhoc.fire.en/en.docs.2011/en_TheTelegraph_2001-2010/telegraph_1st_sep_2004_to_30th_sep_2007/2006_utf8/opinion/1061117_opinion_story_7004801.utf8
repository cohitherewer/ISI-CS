The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 IS SPRING FAR BEHIND?

 MALVIKA SINGH

 The winter, the crisp, cold weather, the bright sunny days are trying, without success, to envelop Delhi. This city is going through its irritating menopausal hot flushes, together with other virus attacks that seem to consume us all. There is a clear shift in weather patterns, all a result of tampering with nature, exploiting the land in a ruthless fashion, lack of enforcement of the existing laws, and rampant corruption.

 The UPA government has bent under left pressure to undo the protective laws that govern our forests and green areas. All this on the pretext that it is restoring the natural rights to tribal communities. This is done by undoing the existing laws, by parcelling out forest land that was never held individually in plots, by handing over mining rights hitherto banned, and allowing the collection of forest produce. All this opening up in a sector that has traditionally been exploited and where there is no monitoring agency that is honest. Another Mandal in the making, as and when the other marginalized communities demand their share of the pie! It is sad that the political class wants to put tribals back in time, showcase them like zoo species in the forests of India.

 These intellectually limited, predictable and pedestrian solutions to human problems of unimaginable magnitude, make one shudder. As the greedy, privileged community destroys the environment, some political entity needs to enter the fray, counter the degradation and initiate the process of restoration. 

 Lacking in spirit

 But who has the spirit to endorse right and fight for a cleansing of the polity? Who is committed to this land and its people? Where is the catalyst for real change change that is not exploitative, exclusive and centered round those who rule with their selfish minds and archaic ideas?

 The messiah will have to emerge from outside the realm of politics and will have to take on the establishment that has failed miserably to deliver a basic civil society. The last century had the Mahatma. This millennium, too, desperately needs a similar saviour who will extricate us from the quagmire of relentless greed and compel the stale leadership to step back, let go and allow the natural growth and development of this ancient civilization that today houses a majority of the constituents of the new generation.

 If India can dispense with the baggage of a generation gone by one that has ceased to be proactive in terms of what modernity and globalization demands, one that is stuck in a conservative, comfortable and familiar time warp, unable to take on the challenges of a world in turmoil and metamorphosis it will be able to grab the opportunity and fight for its place on the world stage. 

 Heralding change

 With the finest human resource in the subcontinent, India is poised to make a substantial impact, be it in international politics, social reform, cultural initiatives, new thinking, exciting alternatives and innovative, inclusive methodologies.

 Over the last few years, there has been a shift in gear. This may not be very visible, but it is happening slowly. The dissemination of information through the small screen has made a mass of anonymous citizens participate, albeit indirectly, in the affairs of the country as well as that of the state. They all have a view, one that has not been articulated or assessed yet. It could be volatile and compel radical change by sheer public pressure, the true ingredient of a healthy democracy. Our lazy political class, living off the spoils of the past, may be in for a rude shock. In their complacency they have presided over the deterioration of ethics in public life. A churning is taking place beneath the surface. It will herald change.

 Letters to Editor

 Do not forgive or forget

 Sir The report, Death for child-smash sisters (Sept 1), is likely to rake up the debate on the death sentence. The crime committed by the two sisters, Renuka Shinde and Seema Gavit, are undoubtedly heinous. But there is another vital issue to be addressed. Kiran Shinde, the husband of one of the killer sisters and one of the accomplices in the crime, has escaped the law merely by turning approver in the case. But Shinde is as culpable as the women. People like him, who devise a short cut and evade punishment, encourage organized crime and pollute the social atmosphere. The purpose of law is not merely to eradicate crime but also to create permanent safeguards against it. What is the guarantee that Shinde would reform his ways? If the sisters deserve punishment, so does he.

 Yours faithfully

 Sir A woman is supposed to be the symbol of motherly love. But the way the two sisters, Renuka Shinde and Seema Gavit, murdered the children in cold blood delivers a body blow to this image. Children are often kidnapped and then maimed for the purpose of begging. But killing them mercilessly just because they had lost their utility to the Gavit family borders on the insane. The women could have left the children in front of an orphanage or abandoned them somewhere. That would have proved less difficult that disposing their dead bodies. 

 The murders show the administration in poor light. What were the police doing when these women carried out their serial kidnappings and murders? It also remains to be seen what the president, who loves children so much, would do with the mercy petition of the two sisters.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Anjanabai, Renuka and Seema seem to resemble the three witches of Macbeth, echoing the words fair is foul and foul is fair. What is most bewildering is that the three separate stages in each individual crime abduction, exploitation and then murder were all accomplished with remarkable finesse. Also unique to this case is the primitive manner in which the children were killed their heads were bashed with a stone or banged against the wall. Irrespective of whether there will be a presidential pardon or not, the law-enforcing authorities should ponder why it took nine killings to apprehend the gang. 

 This case would be invaluable to criminal researchers, who can investigate to what extent genes and social factors are responsible for the criminal propensities of the members of a particular family. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The sisters definitely deserve to be hanged for the crimes they have committed. The president should not consider their appeal for mercy. A sentence should not be based on gender, but on the nature of the crime (Unspeakable logic, Sept 3). In India, the judiciary has always reserved capital punishment for exceptional circumstances and only the most shocking of crimes. If the death sentence is done away with, it might encourage similar crimes. The fear of capital punishment serves as a deterrent and discourages citizens from carrying out such brutality. Lastly, the women should not receive an easy death. Let them feel the agony which each of their victims must have felt.

 Yours faithfully,

 Changing images

 Sir Shuma Rahas article, For your eyes only (Aug 28), raises a valid point about the stereotypical depiction of women in the media, which is perhaps far more indecent than their portrayal in music videos or item numbers. Raha blames the media and the advertising industry for being instrumental in propagating this stereotype. However, the fact cannot be discounted that in reality, it is usually the woman who decides on the purchase of household items. Hence, the manufacturers of such goods cannot but target the woman. The question that should be asked is since when has the portrayal of women in the media defined and shaped their aspirations? Had that indeed been the case, women would never have been able to achieve all that they have in the past few decades. To say that the indecent portrayal of women is worrisome is one thing, but to claim that women are gullible enough to fall for such stereotypes is stretching the matter too far. Why should a woman have to pay attention to or conform to pre-determined notions of womanhood? 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Priyanka Aich and Avimanyu Datta,

 Sir The proposal to make the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act more stringent is unrealistic. We have moved on to the era of personal freedom and individual choice where the idea of censorship is unacceptable. Moreover, the concept of decency and indecency is a relative notion. I beg to differ with Shuma Raha about advertisements. Is showing a lady as a homemaker or a loving mother a regressive idea? Viewing must be left to the individual. Just as one cannot be forced to wear a bikini, one cannot be prevented from wearing a burqa, too.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Somendra Datta,

 TECHNOLOGY FOR ANIMAL CARE

 DOCUMENT

 Excerpts from the International Atomic Energy Agencys Nuclear Technology Review 2006

 Molecular and nuclear related diagnostics are of particular interest in animal health because they can increase the sensitivity and specificity of methods to detect animal diseases to a previously unachievable level. Notwithstanding the increasing use of non-radioactive methods, a need remains to use radioisotopes for the identification and characterization of proteins, deoxyribonucleic acid and ribonucleic acid, because of the achievable high levels of sensitivity. Developments in micro-fabrication, microfluidics and nanotechnology offer poss- ibilities for the production of more sensitive, rapid and robust devices that perform under diverse conditions. 

 So-called lab-on-a- chip devices offer the abi- lity to integrate complex laboratory diagnoses...in a single miniaturized device. An important goal in the current development of diagnostic devices is to make them usable in the field, thereby shortening reaction time for implementation of preventative or control measures. 

 In addition to the more classical nuclear techno- logies, nuclear-based gene expression methods are providing a deeper understanding of nutritional, reproductive and disease elements that lead to simple-to-use manipulations for enhancing livestock productivity. 

 Historically, radioimmunoassay, which employs radioisotopes in the measurement of the concentration of a given molecule in a biological sample, has been the dominant techno- logy in the field of animal reproduction and breeding. Radioisotopes also serve as the basis for a number of technologies that deal with the labelling of nucleotides. 

 By incorporating radioisotopes...into short DNA synthetic probes, researchers have a way to identify DNA polymorphism which permits the identification of genes influencing traits of interest and confirm parentage and/or measure the quantity of DNA or RNA in a given biological sample. Subsequent testing can determine which animals carry the superior forms of genes of interest and this information can be used to improve accuracy of selection and, in turn, increase productivity. 

 In addition, identification and tracing of DNA polymorphisms can contribute to the genetic characterization of desired breeds and emphasize genetic conservation. Novel technologies such as dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, magnetic resonance spectroscopy and compu- ter tomography may provide methods to determine body composition, carcass quality and muscularity without the need to slaughter animals...

 Food control systems need to take account of the entire food production chain to ensure the quality, safety and wholesomeness of plant and animal products intended for human consumption, aspects also of importance to transboundary trade. More governments are now implementing this concept, in part as a result of increasing consumer concerns about food safety. 

 Nuclear and related techniques assist governments in implementing a food chain approach by developing methodologies, indicators and guidelines that protect food chains from safety hazards at their source through good agricultural practices, including a coordinated approach in the application of best water management practices. These activities include the improvement of laboratory quality management and analytical techniques to meet international standards for pesticides, mycotoxins and veterinary drug residues.

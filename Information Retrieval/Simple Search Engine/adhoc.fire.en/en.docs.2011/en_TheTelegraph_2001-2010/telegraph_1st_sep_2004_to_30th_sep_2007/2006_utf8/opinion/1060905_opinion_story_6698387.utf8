 Excerpts from the International Atomic Energy Agencys Nuclear Technology Review 2006

 Regarding disposal of low and intermediate level radioactive waste, noteworthy developments took place in 2005 in Belgium, Hungary and the Republic of Korea. In Belgium, at least two communities voted to become candidate sites for a national low level waste (LLW) repository. In Hungary, residents of Bataapati voted overwhelmingly to host the countrys final repository for LLW and intermediate level waste (ILW). And in the Republic of Korea, Gyeongju was designated as the site for the first LLW and ILW repository, conditional on a successful geological site assessment, after almost 90 per cent of Gyeongjus voters approved, compared with 67 to 84 per cent in three other candidate communities. 

 In 2005, decommissioning of the Trojan and Maine Yankee NPPs in the United States of America was completed. Except for their separate spent fuel storage facilities, both sites were released for unrestricted public use. Thus, by the end of 2005, eight power plants around the world have been completely decommissioned with their sites released for unconditional use... 

 Non-proliferation concerns have increased in the past few years. Proliferation resistance is a characteristic of a nuclear energy system that impedes the diversion or undeclared production of nuclear material or misuse of technology. As part of the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) and the Agencys International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles (INPRO), increased attention is being paid to the issue of intrinsic proliferation resistance features, i.e. those features that result from the technical design of nuclear energy systems...

 In January 2006, Russian President Vladimir Putin outlined a proposal to create a system of international centres providing nuclear fuel cycle services, including enrichment, on a nondiscriminatory basis and under the control of the Agency. In February 2006, the US announced a Global Nuclear Energy Partnership to develop advanced recycling technologies that would not separate plutonium; international collaboration in supplying fuel for states who agree not to pursue enrichment and reprocessing; advanced reactors to consume recycled spent fuel while providing energy; and safe and secure small reactors well suited to the needs of developing countries. 

 Identified conventional uranium resources are currently estimated at 3.8 million tonnes (MtU) for resources recoverable at costs below $80/kg and at 4.7 MtU for costs below $130/kg... For both categories these estimates have increased in the last two years due both to new discoveries and to the reallocation of some resources from higher cost categories to lower cost categories. Undiscovered conventional resources add another estimated 7.1 MtU at costs less than $130/kg. This includes both resources that are expected to occur either in or near known deposits, and more speculative resources that are thought to exist in geologically favourable, yet unexplored areas. There are also an estimated further 3.0 MtU of speculative resources for which production costs have not been specified. 

 Unconventional uranium resources and thorium further expand the resource base. Unconventional uranium resources include about 22 MtU that occur in phosphate deposits and up to 4000 MtU contained in seawater. The technology to recover uranium from phosphates is mature with estimated costs of $60100/kgU. The technology to extract uranium from seawater has only been demonstrated at the laboratory scale, and extraction costs are currently estimated at $300/kgU.

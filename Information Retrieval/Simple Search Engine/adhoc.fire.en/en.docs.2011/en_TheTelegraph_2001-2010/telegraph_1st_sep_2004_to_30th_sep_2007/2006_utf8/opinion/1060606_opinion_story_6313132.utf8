 POLITICS AND THE HIGH LIFE

Malvika Singh

 The Rahul Mahajan ?story? is symptomatic of the all-consuming illness that has afflicted the political class. The virus has been pervading the lives of ordinary, honest Indians, making them victims of power that is propped up by corruption and gun-toting sleaze, protected by a malleable administration hanging in there for a share of the crumbs. The great Indian public knows it regardless of government and police cover-ups. They see the lies, the brutal assault on honesty and integrity in a society in transition that has shed all semblance of civilized values and restraint.

 When the press go berserk with stories of the ?high life of the rich?, they seem equally disconnected with such social definitions. What we are witnessing is the ?low life of the newly moneyed political class?, a class of people who have run amok insulting, exploiting and putting to shame a civilization that lived by its rules, its values and its ethics. Drugs and drunkenness, rape and shooting people, is not the high life of the rich and famous by any stretch of the imagination. 

 It is the indulgence of those who have illicit money through wheeling and dealing, who have no roots in cosmopolitan urban life and living, who ape what they are unable to comprehend because they think that?s the way to fame and fortune, the route up the ?social? ladder, who believe cash, not credit card, can buy their immorality and bury it, and all because they hail from this new ?reserved? class that has priority over the rest with a special set of inhuman rules that it lives by.

 Kill the hypocrisy

 This statement may be politically incorrect, but it is true. The other constituency that lives at the edge is of the people who are clinically imbalanced, depressives, ill men and women who need medical attention but who are afraid to ask for it. Finally, there is the urban poor, who live on the street, whose lives are desperate and truly inhuman, for whom taking drugs is a release. They are serious drug addicts and no civic authority cares. They wallow in their addiction on the streets of the capital, lying outside temples where they get some alms, often in proximity to police stations. That is the gruesome truth, the reality that stares us in the face. Therefore, why all the flip comments? Why this fear or apprehension in calling a spade a spade? Manmohan Singh is an honest, god-fearing man. Surely he would want to cleanse the political space, and compel it to set a fresh example of probity and appropriateness in the public arena that would initiate a renewal.

 In this context of ?cleansing? a corroded and corrupt system, the prime minister, who triggered the opening up and unshackling of the economy, needs to look at the harassment that is being meted out to those who spend their legitimate, declared incomes on goods and services. Recently, the finance ministry has begun to pursue, with surprising efficiency, all those who use their credit cards to buy whatever they choose from the marketplace, by sending them ominous bits of paper asking whether they pay their taxes, whether they have earned the money that lies in their accounts, and suchlike. 

 The ministry needs to chase politicians first, closely followed by the bureaucracy, then those who spend vast amounts in cash at the premium stores, thereafter the citizenry who pay their taxes and who have done so for decades, whose ancestors have done so and who buy legitimately. Doctor Sahib, don?t allow your government to victimize and use honest, dignified people as scapegoats while it pretends to ?discover? the corrupt through these ridiculous measures. After all, it is the politician who needs the black money for elections, for his ?high living?, and not law abiding citizens who live a ?high life? on their own earnings. Kill the hypocrisy.

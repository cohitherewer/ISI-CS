 Serial verdicts

 Sir The Mumbai serial blasts, which took place 13 years ago, killing 257 people and leaving many injured, had perhaps been forgotten because of the global terrorist attacks after them. But the blasts are in the news once more, having finally come up for judgment (Serial verdicts in serial blasts, Sep 13). With 123 accused, it is no wonder that the judge, P.D. Kode has said that verdicts will be given for eight individuals at a time. However, even if the Tada court delivers its judgment, the convicted can appeal to a higher court and it may, in fact, take decades for the final judgment to be read a period in which some more of the accused may die. Unless Indias criminal justice system is updated and upgraded to deal with crimes expeditiously, the country will continue to be branded as a soft target by various kinds of criminals and terrorists. The procedure followed makes a mockery of an effective judicial system and renders hollow the governments eagerness to prevent terrorism and other crimes.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Just like the blasts, the verdicts on the accused in the Mumbai blasts case are also to come serially. It is undesirable that important criminal cases such as this one take so long to be judged and that the verdicts, when they are given, are predictably inconclusive. The masterminds in this case Dawood Ibrahim and Tiger Memon are still at large, provided shelter by one country or the other and enjoying all the comforts of life. There is no doubt that such delays are the result of a lack of integrity, coordination and cooperation on the part of the administration, the politicians and the judiciary of our country. A combination of these ensures that the country keeps bleeding and losing its resources, while precious little is done to stop the terrorists from having their way.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The acquittal of some members of the Memon family means that terrorists may commit, or conspire to commit, acts of terror and then serve a sentence of five or six years quite like taking a holiday. They can then come back into society and enjoy the benefits secured from their terrorist activities. If this is so, then why was a farce kept running for 13 years? Besides, a Tada court cannot really deliver justice to people who have lost their dear ones or been destroyed physically and mentally. The whole investigative and judicial exercise is a waste because the criminals are still out there. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Endgame

 Sir Kimveer Gills shooting spree in Montreal proves that he was, above all, mentally challenged. Gills crime would call for severe punishment in any society but in this instance, Indias image somehow seems to have been tarnished particularly given that in the age of global terror, the West is constantly labelling south Asians as suspect. However, it is a relief that Gill was shot dead on the spot. His photographs on the blog, which show him posing with weapons of various kinds, make one wonder if he was inspired by some Hollywood action movie.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir I felt flabbergasted at the coverage given to the Kimveer Gill story. The manner in which reports have dwelt on such things as his hairstyle, his black trench coat, his professed joy in drinking whisky in the morning, and so on, leaves a question mark on the medias priorities. Is it all because the man in question is of Indian origin? Such shooting sprees by individuals who claim to have been inspired by computer games are not infrequent in American society. Either the Indian reader or the press has become perverted in its tastes. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Surajit Das,

 Parting shot

 Sir It is surprising to see the senior counsel for the government informing the Supreme Court that the members of parliament, who were expelled from the house after being found guilty on the charge of accepting bribes, can seek re-election (Sacked MPs can contest, says govt, Sept 15). According to our law, a public servant found accepting or offering bribe is punishable by not only sacking but also imprisonment. He is also debarred from seeking re-employment in a government or semi-government (or private) organization. The MPs are also public servants as they not only get paid from the public exchequer but are also entitled to lifelong pension, derived from the taxpayers money. Why should there be different sets of laws for different groups of citizens? It is evident that our law-makers make laws to suit their own ends. The counsel has also said that the expulsions assure the public that those who have abused the office would not be tolerated. It is upto the public now to say whether they really feel assured. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 S.B.Gupta,

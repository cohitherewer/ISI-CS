The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 FADE OUT

 It is difficult to cite a single good reason why a government should run a film studio, a theatre or any other such venture. There are irrefutable arguments, on the other hand, as to why such enterprises should not be the business of a government, especially in a poor country. The members of the Bengali film fraternity who took to the streets in Calcutta to oppose the state governments decision to privatize the Technicians Studio have obviously got many things wrong. They betray a skewed understanding of the role of the government. And they are wrong in assuming that the government must come to the aid of a bad venture in the name of promoting the arts. Worse still, they seem to have a vested interest in wanting the government to spend taxpayers money on a small number of beneficiaries at the studio rather than on providing drinking water, electricity, schools or roads to the people who do not have them. It is another matter that most of the Bengali films made with the governments help are of a pathetic quality. There is also an element of hypocrisy in the cry for preserving the Technicians Studio. Most of the protesters cannot be unaware of how primitive the conditions there are. They know that the government cannot run the studio efficiently, let alone profitably, simply because it is not the governments job. 

 The opposition to the governments move betrays the old socialist mindset that saw a role for the government in a persons life from the cradle to the grave. That Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee now wants to get rid of the studio captures the changing scenario. It was Mr Bhattacharjee who had once defended the grant of government funds and other patronage for the making and distribution of Bengali films. That experiment not only failed to add any value to Bengali cinema, but also ended in corruption charges. The move on the Technicians Studio suggests that Mr Bhattacharjee is now prepared to shed even his own pet ideas of the past. It is part of the process that began with the privatization of the Great Eastern Hotel. A similar change happened for the 126-year-old Star Theatre. The next in line should be the decrepit and loss-making Rupayan, the state-run colour film laboratory. The ultimate test, however, should be the sale of Nandan, the state-owned film complex, which stands as a testimony to the socialist baggage of an unreformed era.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 Lalu Prasad may be out of 1, Anne Marg, but he is still king. Even in the capital, which is no a stranger to the benevolence of rulers, there is hardly anyone who can beat the Bihari in the art of holding the durbar, and ?giving? in style. So this Holi, while many Congresswallahs and saffronites decided not to celebrate the festival to mark the tragedy at Varanasi, Lalu was found mixing colours with the zeal of a child and showering crimson currency with the elan of a shahenshah. Out of the notes, a sombre Mahatma stared out dolefully. But nothing could upset the merry-making. Not even the spoilsport Election Commission. There are no elections round the corner in Bihar, thankfully, and therefore no EC to come between the rajah and his praja. 

 Our didi knew it all along. Now there is definite evidence to prove right her suspicion of the Congress?s chumminess with the left in Bengal. Can anyone guess who is the new adviser to Margaret Alva, the AICC gen-sec in charge of West Bengal? Chances are, it is the inimitable CPI(M) MP, Mohammad Salim, for he has been spotted talking to Margaret several times on matters very close to the hearts of both their respective parties. Alva has apparently been overheard asking Salim even on how many seats the Congress should contest and where the Congress stood vis-?-vis didi. And did Salim provide Maggie with the right answers? But would she know before it is too late?

 The RSS is yet to get over the Sanjay Joshi episode and is fairly convinced that the man had been framed. At the recent pratinidhi sabha held at Nagpur, three CDs were shown to 35 state chiefs. One had the Pakistan president as a Rambhakt, dressed in saffron and performing a puja. The second and the third showed the Uttar Pradesh chief minister and a former Bihar CM in a drunken stupor or other such ?unimaginable? situations. The aim was to prove that in this era of technology, anything could be shown to be possible. We agree, entirely. Anything is possible.

 In the Rajya Sabha polls, many impossible things were made possible. There was Mabel Rabello, formerly representing Madhya Pradesh in the upper house, retaining her foothold despite a dismal performance. Mabel is said to have been helped not so much by god himself, as by his men. The Congress chief was apparently flooded with letters and petitions from churches and religious orders for letting Mabel have another go. There was also the mysterious case of Satyavrat Chaturvedi, who was recently dropped as AICC gen-sec for his inept handling of UP affairs. Now the man from Khajuraho wears a smile as broad as Mabel?s. If the latter has her missionary friends to thank, Chaturvedi has the illustrious Brahmins in the party to pay his gratitude to ? Janardhan Dwivedi, Naval Kishore Sharma and Motilal Vora. Lets say god helps those who help themselves.

 No takers for godforsaken Narain Dutt Tiwari, however. The old man has sent his resignation as Uttaranchal CM with a postscript that he wants to stay on in active politics. But no one is listening. There are some who want him sent to some Raj Bhavan, but Tiwari himself is not interested in that. There are others who want him to continue as CM. If he wins next year?s assembly elections, it could be shown as proof of madam?s farsightedness. If he fails, he could be written off, finally. 

 In Rajasthan, the Congress seems to be all thumbs. Months ago, a party spokesman released a book that had many unsavoury references to the Nehru-Gandhi family. Now the Central government-run Nehru Yuvak Kendra has purchased in bulk a book that makes uncharitable remarks about Rajiv and Sanjay Gandhi. The organization is under the ministry of youth affairs headed by Mani Shankar Aiyar. Another controversy? 

 The most upsetting nomination to the Rajya Sabha was probably that of Rashid Alvi, a former BSP turncoat and backbencher. Salman Khurshid hasn?t stopped wondering why he has been kept out.

 Now that Pramod Mahajan has learnt the ?three rules? of Winston Churchill, he is forever willing to teach them to all. His victims this time were two UPA ministers, Praful Patel and Dayanidhi Maran, present on stage with him at a conclave in New Delhi recently. The event coincided with his 34th wedding anniversary, but Mahajan took a break from the celebrations to attend it. Of the three cardinal rules, Pramod said, one is never to climb a ladder that is leaning towards you; the second is never to kiss a woman leaning away from you (at which point Mahajan added that he was speaking from 34 years of experience). Then he turned to Patel and warned that the UPA should not take credit for the NDA?s policies for that would be like marrying a pregnant woman and taking credit for someone else?s success. Despite Mahajan?s canniness, it was Patel who had the last laugh. While winding up, he said that he had a flight to catch, and Pramod a wife.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 A CITY TO BE PROUD OF

 Malvika Singh

 The chief minister of Delhi has been in the throes of an intensive discussion with a cross-section of city professionals, trying to understand how to address the growing urban problems that face this city. Other than in Jaipur, no CM in any other state of India has bothered to look at how wrong urban planning and initiatives have gone. Our cities are unwieldy slums, with a burgeoning population living in illegal habitats with shortages of water and power. Municipalities have ceased to do their job, corruption runs rampant, civic sensibilities have died.

 With the exception of Lutyens?s Delhi, no city space makes Indians proud. Maintenance is non-existent, replaced by extortion and wrongdoing. Politicians and administrators lead the pack in breaking all rules and norms thereby endorsing a free-for-all with no holds barred. Upward mobility is today synonymous with a lack of aesthetic sensibility. There is nothing creative we see happening around our urban spaces. There are no architectural landmarks post-Lutyens, no building of any scale in aesthetics or proportions. There are no experiments that can lead to a fresh idiom that could trigger changes in our cities and their scapes. Urban India is a blundering muddle. 

 Tied up in knots

 Unfortunately, the ?builders? have got the governments tied up in knots. Land use norms are flouted each moment and the authorities turn a blind eye. This community, with its inordinate ?wealth?, have manipulated the system and succeeded in corroding it to the point that the sickness has become a part and parcel of India. Nobody wants to confront that formidable force for many reasons known to all. For those who execute the set and established norms that have been unequivocally laid down, this force has fast become its mai baap, inducing it to condone irregularities for a price. The net result of this overwhelming greed in all quarters has led to the slumification of urban India, a country where old, historic cities have been among the finest in the world. It is ironic that we should have permitted this deterioration. 

 A rectification seems to be underway. City master-plans need adjustment, professionals from all disciplines need to be involved in the restructuring ranging from architects, town planners and builders, to scientists, engineers, artists, writers, traditional skilled artisans, politicians, administrators and members of the financial community. International experts in these areas of social and economic activity need to be brought in to share their experiences. Minds need to break out of the existing, stale parameters and think out of the box. To be innovative is critical in this sphere of growth. And, most important, the young must be included in this critical debate as it is their world that needs to be remodelled to suit a changing demand. The superimposition of dead ideas, something we allow our ruling authorities to inflict upon us, must be damned and banned if the future of India has to be saved from mutilation. 

 For a start, as we have a constitutional authority in the Election Commission, we should consider two such entities to protect the sanctity of water and power for the people of India. This would be one way to start the corrective and eliminate entrenched governmental and administrative corruption. Equality must be ensured in this public realm. With this will come dignity and a revival of a sense of pride. From there will emanate legitimate demands for civilized life and living. In the absence of the passionate vision of an individual leader to activate new thought and action, maybe we should make the best of what we can through collective processes initiated by state governments, like the Delhi and Rajasthan governments, both headed by intelligent women, one Congress and the other from the BJP!

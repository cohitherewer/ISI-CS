 DIARY

 It may be a festival of lights everywhere, but in Chhattisgarh, things have taken a rather sour turn. Two state ministers are reportedly at loggerheads over the quality of khoya used to make sweets. Nankiram Kanwar, the food and civil supplies minister, wants CM Raman Singh to put a ban on the supply of khoya from Agra and Gwalior on account of its poor quality. But the health minister, Krishnamurti Bandhi, will have none of it. He thinks that a ban during the festive season would flood the market with khoya of poorer quality. However, Raman has found a novel way out of the problem. He has decided to sample the fare for himself in order to find out more about the quality of the product. So Singh will be found busy digging into delicious batti ka khoya, chikna khoya and danedar khoya, while his ministers continue trading charges against one another.

 Feroze Varun Gandhi again. He is supposed to be spending his time scotching rumours about where his heart lies. A few days ago, the buzz in the political circles was that the young man was contemplating a move to the Congress after the BJP denied him a ticket from Vidisha. But Varun has no time for such speculation. To prove his point, he keeps reminding everyone that he has not met his cousins, Rahul and Priyanka, for years now. And anyway, he has his hands full for the moment. He has to take care of his mother, and there is also the business of taking Gandhis legacy to the nation. But is there any need for Varun to spread Bapus word? Hasnt Munnabhai taken up that responsibility already, and even made a success of it?

 The IMF executive director, BP Mishra, is all set to hang up his boots at the end of the month. But the present finance secretary, Adarsh Kishore, who is supposed to succeed Mishra, seems in no hurry to head for foreign shores. On the contrary, he is supposed to have set his eyes on the post of the cabinet secretary. Mishra apparently has met the Congress chief to fulfil his dream. Unfortunately, everything does not seem to have gone according to the plan. Kishore is reported to have informed madam about his wish to stay put in India to serve the country. But Sonia Gandhi, it is heard, stunned him into silence by retorting that he could do the same from his office in Washington! If this does not make Mishra start packing his bags, nothing else will.

 Sharad Pawar is fishing in troubled waters these days. The Union agriculture minister has been getting in touch with grumpy Congressmen who are mightily peeved with the party. Pawars guestlist is rather long. Former foreign minister, Natwar Singh, the ex-CM of Haryana, Bhajan Lal, the TRS president, Chandrasekhar Rao, Pawar is said to have met them all. He has also reportedly dispatched his trusted aide, PA Sangma, to meet Sudhir Ranjan Majumdar and Birojit Sinha in Tripura, both piqued over the choice of the new PCC chief. The dissidents in Assam, currently sidelined by Tarun Gogoi, have also found Pawars broad shoulders to lean on. But why is the Maratha strongman being sweet to the dissenters? Apparently, Pawar is only following the advice of his astrologers who have told him to launch a national party with rebel help. This, the wise men have said, is the only way Pawar could win the 

 PMs chair.

 When Pranab Mukherjee and Ambika Soni decide to break bread, the event provides ample food for thought for Congressmen. So when the two met up recently a few days before the scheduled cabinet reshuffle, it set tongues wagging. Party insiders are of the view that the meeting had little to do with restructuring. At a time when party politics is driven by jealousy and ambition, Mukherjee and Soni perhaps felt that the best way of foiling rival plans was by teaming up with each other.

 Here is some more news on sweets, this time from Himachal Pradesh. Citing adulteration as a problem, the government-run Milkfed has decided to prepare and sell hygienic sweets at cheaper rates during Diwali. The goodies would be available in all the ten districts of the state, and sold in dairy outlets and government handicraft showrooms. Given that the treasuries in most other states is not exactly overflowing, isnt it time they considered following Himachals example and try making a fast buck?

 Meanwhile, the war between P Venugopal, the director of AIIMS, and the Union health minister, A Ramadoss, shows no sign of ending. In the latest round of exchange, Ramadoss has accused the director of being biased against members from the reserved categories. To strengthen his case, the health minister is supposed to have presented irrefutable evidence. Ramadoss has cited the fact that the lone junior doctor in the institute who reportedly died of dengue belonged to a scheduled caste. This, Ramadoss argues, is proof enough that Venugopal cares little for SC/STs. Otherwise, the man would have surely attempted to save the poor doctors life. Unfortunately, the minister seems to have bitten off more than he can chew. It is clear that such an allegation is unlikely to pass muster in a court of law. After all, it would be quite difficult to convince any sane judge that mosquitoes can be programmed in such a manner that they bite members of a particular community only, while leaving others alone.

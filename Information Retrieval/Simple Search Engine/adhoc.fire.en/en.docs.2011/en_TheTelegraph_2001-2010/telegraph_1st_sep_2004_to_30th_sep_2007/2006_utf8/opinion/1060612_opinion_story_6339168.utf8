 SURPRISE HIKE

 The Reserve Bank of India?s move to raise its policy rates by 25 basis points has surprised the markets, and bond yields have moved up as a result. The surprise was not in the rate-hike, which was widely expected, given the rise in inflation and the fuel price increase. What caught the market unawares was the timing of the move ? most dealers expected a rate hike at the next quarterly monetary policy announcement, due at the end of July. The RBI governor has said that he has to move in tandem with other central banks in the fight against global inflation. Last week, the central banks of Turkey, Thailand, South Korea, South Africa, Denmark and the European Union all raised their policy rates. The US Federal Reserve is very likely to raise overnight rates at its June 29 meeting, while the Bank of Japan is considering an end to its five-year zero-interest-rate policy. Strong growth, high liquidity and high oil prices have led to an uptick in inflation indicators in many countries, prompting central banks to increase interest rates. Further, the recent meltdown in the stock markets has led to a flight of funds from emerging markets, putting their currencies under pressure. Raising interest rates is an obvious way of defending the currency and preventing capital flight. Moreover, a weaker currency also leads to imported inflation, because the price of imports, particularly for oil-importers, rises. Higher interest rates therefore help combat both domestic and imported inflation. Also, no investor wants to put his money in a depreciating currency and any move to defend the currency could therefore lessen capital flight, an option that would weigh heavily at a time when foreign institutional investors have withdrawn $2.5 billion in less than a month. Because of all these factors, the RBI had hardly any option but to increase rates.

 Some banks have already announced that they will be increasing their rates as a consequence of the RBI move. Will it lead to a slowdown in growth? At the moment, that seems unlikely because rising incomes will continue to bolster consumption. Housing affordability, for instance, is much higher today than at the time of the last housing boom in the mid-Nineties. It is also unlikely that corporates will put off their investment plans just because interest rates go up a percentage point or two. In fact, the RBI should have increased rates in April, at the time of the last policy statement, but it could not do so under political pressure. With gross domestic product growth for the fourth quarter of 2005-06 coming in at a sizzling 9.3 per cent, with money supply growing at a year-on-year rate of 18.5 per cent and with inflation moving up, it is time to make amends.

Mastering the real 

 VELZQUEZ (National Gallery Company, price not mentioned) by 

Dawson W. Carr is a beautifully produced and scrupulously researched catalogue, 

published to accompany a retrospective of this Spanish Masters works that opened 

at the National Gallery, London, a couple of days ago. A contemporary of Cervantes 

and Caldern, Diego Rodrguez de Silva y Velzquez (1599-1660) has come to embody 

the sensual and intellectual essence of the monarqua espaola. Cervantes 

described this Spain as a republic of enchanted men, living outside the natural 

order of things. On the left is The Water-Seller of Seville (1618-22), 

which Velzquez started painting when the Thirty Years War began, for Juan de 

Fonseca y Figueroa, a distinguished Sevillean. On the right stands Aesop, the 

6th-century BC Greek writer, done about 1636-8. It adorned the Torre de la Parada, 

a private royal lodge in the hunting reserve of the Pardo Palace near Madrid.

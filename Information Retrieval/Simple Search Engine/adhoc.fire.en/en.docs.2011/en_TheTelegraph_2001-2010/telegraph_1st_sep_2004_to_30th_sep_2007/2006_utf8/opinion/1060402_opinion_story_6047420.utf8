 GURU GREG 

 - The outcome is less important than the process

 Greg Chappell tells Dola Mitra how he set about changing the Indian cricket team

The phone rings a good half a dozen times, before 

the voice on the other end says, hello. 

Am I speaking to Greg Chappell? 

Never heard of him, says the voice 

on the other end. 

 That, apart from the strong Down Under accent, is a dead giveaway. For there is arguably nobody in India right now who hasnt heard of him. Greg Chappell, the Australian coach of the Indian team, has been more in the news in the recent past than Team India. 

 And, no, we are not just talking about cricket. For Chappell ? the man who first shot into the limelight after he got into an unseemly row with former Indian skipper Sourav Ganguly ? is not just in the news for the series of unprecedented wins that the Indian team has been witness to in recent months. He is also the cynosure of all eyes for another reason: Chappell is being feted as a management guru. 

 Team building is the new mantra and Chappell its chief promoter. The coach has been receiving invitations to lecture on how a team can be turned around. Indeed, he has given a lecture at Hindustan Lever Limited (HLL) on this. 

 Chappell, clearly, is being viewed as someone who has managed to drill that into a team once best described as unpredictable. He points out that when he joined the team as its coach in June last year, India had a terrible record when it came to batting second or chasing scores. In recent times weve won 12 in a row ? chasing, he exults. 

 The coach himself would tell you that all jobs ? in cricket or elsewhere ? require a plan if they are to be executed well. So when Chappell was approached by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for the coachs job, one of the first things he did was sit down with friend and sports scientist Ian Frazer and do what in management jargon is known as a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis ? an exercise for managers to determine the strengths and weaknesses of companies, so that solutions can be worked out. The test, Chappell says, gave him an idea on what to start with. 

 Among the strengths were Indias large size and love for cricket. The teams strength too was its obvious passion for cricket. The weaknesses included fielding. India was recognised as one of the worst fielding teams in the world, says Chappell. 

A Wicket Game Plan 

 Spend time with players, getting to know 

them and explaining to them their strengths and weaknesses. 

 Teach players the principles of success by interacting with them in 

the locker room or on the field. 

 Change the training programme. Just practising doesnt help. Create 

obstacles for the players, which they have to overcome. 

 Never tell players they are doing things incorrectly or do it like this. 

Instead, catch them doing something right. Encourage them to push themselves to 

do something theyve never done before. 

 Give the team enough rest time. 

 Show team members that even the best can fail.

But, notes, Chappell, As a player and commentator, 

I was not unfamiliar with Indian cricket. One of the first things that I wanted 

to do was establish that the outcome is less important than the process. Whether 

in business or cricket or in any field, all successful people say that. This helps 

take the pressure off ourselves and we can perform better.

 Chappell, who presented a paper called Commitment to Excellence to the BCCI detailing how he intended to go about tackling the weaknesses of the team, gives a glimpse of his strategy. Pointing fingers, says the man who got into a piquant situation after he raised a dubious finger to a booing crowd, wont work. I find that going up and telling someone that you are doing this incorrectly, do it like this, just doesnt work, he says. 

 It is a theme he would return to at his HLL lecture ? follow the process and the outcome will take care of itself; secondly, team leaders should try and build confidence rather than only pointing out faults. A leader in business has to learn that sometimes you have to help people by providing a helping hand or a shoulder to cry on or a pat on the back. It could even be a look or a smile. That inspires confidence ? its like saying, look Im here. You have to be empathetic and understanding. Focus on catching them doing the right thing. You cant just constantly chop someone down. To be only critical will destroy someones confidence. 

 After Chappell took over, he spent time individually with the players, getting to know each one of them. I would explain to them their strengths and weaknesses. I explained that there were certain areas where we were deficient and that we needed to get better. Fielding was a big part of it. I would say that India had to be known as one of the best fielding teams in the world.

 Among the first steps was to change the training programme and the things that the team was doing in training. Just going out and practising for the sake of practising was not the right approach. But to change the way people do things is to change the way people think. So we worked on that aspect quite a lot to get them to train differently, he says. 

 For practice sessions, Chappell would create obstacles for the players to overcome. For example, a player would be blindfolded and then asked to dress another player from the kit that would be laid out before him on the ground. The only guidance he would get was from team members who would point out when he made a mistake. We tell the players that we may ask them to do something that may seem strange to them. But wed like you to accept that though it might seem crazy, there may a method to what we are doing. 

 And Chappell instilled a mantra that most management experts swear by: the belief that anybody can reach the top of a ladder. For this, sometimes we orchestrate things to make someone like Sachin Tendulkar ? who is very good at cricket ? not look too perfect. Occasionally, we get him and the others to do something we know he is not very good at so that he can actually look human. The other guys then think that Sachin Tendulkar is really not that much different from us. He actually struggled to do that particular thing. And I can actually do it quite well.

 A lot of the messages that Chappell wanted to convey were passed on outdoors. The reason some play sport is because they have a particular physical gift and personality. They dont like sitting inside. Theyd much rather be outside. I would often talk about the principle of success through interactions in the locker room or in the field. And I looked for opportunities to interact with them. Chappell recalls that in one of his first tours with the Indian team, he and the cricketers spent long hours going from one place to another by bus. A lot of our discussions took place on such bus travels.

 On these trips, hed tell the team that if they wanted to be good on the field, theyd have to start preparing for it off the field. You cant think one way all through the week and then turn up on game day and try and think another way. It should be a seamless transition from a training day to a game day, he explains. 

 Chappell confesses that he and his support staff and players pinched ideas. We observed a lot of success stories and tried to emulate them. We looked at successful people in sports?and spoke to coaches of other sports too. We looked at swimming, we looked at tennis, we looked at baseball, we looked at basketball to find out what they are doing. We looked at the Dutch soccer team that won the World Cup back in the late 80s. Weve looked at successful organisations from the New York Yankees to the Russian ice hockey team that won a gold in the Olympics. We looked at the German tennis programmes that produced Boris Becker and Steffi Graf. 

 To be sure, Chappell is privately accused by some players of ruling by fear ? players fear they may be dropped if they dont toe his line. He declines to comment on this, saying that the question falls outside the ambit of team building which hed agreed to talk to The Telegraph about. 

For Chappell, every victory for the Indian team ? 

the latest was in Faridabad on Friday ? points to the fact that making a team 

work is the same in every field. Cricket, after all, is a game of problem 

solving, stresses Chappell. Just like, the management gurus would say, everything 

else.

on the right track

What do human resource development (HRD) executives 

and company managers think of Greg Chappells strategy? Can his strategy 

be applied elsewhere? Most agree that hes been on the right track. Says 

a senior Hindustan Lever manager: For us, building up team strength is vital. 

Not that we dont care about the individual, but the individual is far less 

important here than the team. Chappell is clearly thinking on the same lines. 

R.R. Nair, a Bangalore-based organisation development 

consultant, says that in Chappells position he may have done just what the 

coach did, except for the way he handled his spat with Sourav Ganguly. Chappell, 

according to him, was clearly found wanting when it came to cultural sensitivity. 

He was too critical, opened his mouth too wide, causing bad blood to flow, 

Nair says. Leaders have to be sensitive to different cultures. Lata Dheer, who 

teaches organisational behaviour at the S.P. Jain Institute of Management and 

Research in Mumbai, which has a case study examining the Chappell-Sourav conflict 

as a management problem, echoes the point. In India, the hierarchical set 

up is still prevalent and seniority commands a certain amount of respect, 

says Dheer. For Chappell its the team before anyone else, and that 

includes the captain.

Still, not everyone agrees that the lessons Chappell 

imparted can be applied to companies. What works for cricket doesnt 

necessarily work for a company board room, says Deepak Segal, executive 

vice president, content, Star India, Mumbai. 

Segal points out, While building a cricket team, 

it is much easier to root out the non-performers. They are performing out in the 

open, right in front of everybody. But in an organisation, it is much more difficult 

to identify the laggard, because his performance or the lack of it will not have 

an immediate impact on company output.

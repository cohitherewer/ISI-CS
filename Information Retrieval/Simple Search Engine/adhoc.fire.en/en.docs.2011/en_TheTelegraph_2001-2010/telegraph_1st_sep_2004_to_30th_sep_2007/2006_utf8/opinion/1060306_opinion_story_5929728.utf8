 GIVE THE DEVIL HIS DUE

 Whatever be his shortcomings, George W. Bush must be thanked for giving India a seat on the high table, writes Jyoti Malhotra

 A friend in need

 Scratch the surface of that white, Anglo-Saxon, protestant skin and the old feeling immediately rears its head. Third world, poverty-stricken nations like India are not supposed to dream about belonging to the world?s most exclusive club. They must, instead, hope to supplicate and bow and bend their way into becoming an economic powerhouse ? one that supplements or is even allowed to compete with the economic prosperity of the United States of America.

 Just like Japan, any great power?s ambitions must be immediately slapped down and nipped in the bud. The chattra chaaya, or the great nuclear umbrella of the Great White Hope, should be enough to accommodate all indigenous aspirations.

 How else can you explain that editorial in the most liberal newspaper of our times, the New York Times? It was called ?Kill that Deal? and it appeared even as George W. Bush was touching down at Palam airport to finally consign the nuclear (dis)order that has run the world since World War II into history. The New York Times? argument was that India, having disrupted the cosy m?nage of the nuclear five by walking rashly into the bedroom at Pokhran eight years ago, could hardly be rewarded for its so-called bad behaviour.

 Wow, said India to itself, and grit its teeth to receive George Bush junior, the invader of Iraq. Here was the destroyer of one of the world?s oldest civilizations readying to reward another ancient nation with the greatest prize of them all ? an acknowledgement of equality. How does one explain this central contradiction to oneself?

 Here is one answer: Surely, this nuclear deal was not only about nuclear energy, nuclear reactors and nuclear fuel. In fact, it was really about one American president, eight years after Pokhran, paying recompense for another American president?s denigration of the Indian school of thought, which demanded the acknowledgement of both respect and equality.

 India had dug itself into a hole, Madeleine Albright had said after Pokhran, about the slow-moving, clumsy, Indian elephant. Well, elephants also have long memories. Surely, it was poetic justice if President Bush not only undid the historic injustices of Bill Clinton, but rewarded India for what the country had done at Pokhran.

 As for the American president, as he fished around the world in the aftermath of 9/11, and decided to make Iraq an example of his democratic mission, he must have realized ?with the help of a few friends led by Condoleezza Rice ? that India was the perfect alternative on the other side of the coin.

 India was poor, it had terrible infrastructure, an abysmal GDP, and a dizzying collection of caste and religions. The only word that described it was anarchic, certainly not a fit case for a natural ally. However, it was also decidedly democratic. And many in the upper class who spoke English also harboured ambitions of becoming as rich and as powerful as the neighbouring Chinese. The same country, whose energies America had helped unleash around 1970, and which was now giving America a run for its money.

 Ironically, even as Bill Clinton himself had begun to see the light on India ? flying in and out of the US as if he was catching the Shatabdi train from Delhi to Chandigarh ? the rest of his liberal friends had remained stuck in that same hole Madeleine Albright had once so eloquently talked about. The New York Times? editorial about not trusting a poor, raucous nation with nuclear weapons was not only totally uninformed, it had also missed the point.

 In fact, in the hugely divisive debate in the run-up to Bush?s India visit, it was interesting to see how the Western world?s left-of-centre liberals (represented by the New York Times) had actually joined hands with the right-wing conservative school. Mark the Economist story on the Indo-US deal, and you can almost feel sorry for the agony the writer seems to have gone through with his embarrassing rhetoric against India.

 Truth is, as President Bush flies home after a resoundingly successful visit ? after a day-long detour of Pakistan where he metaphorically slapped Musharraf on the latter?s demanding a similar nuclear agreement ? India is already adjusting its global positioning system with the Bush administration. And despite his horrifying credentials in Iraq, the liberal classes must now come to terms with the fact that it has taken a simple uncomplicated man like George Bush to let India sit on the same high table as the world?s most powerful nations.

 Other truths will take somewhat longer to sink in. Like the fact that large parts of the Western world, cutting across ideological lines, wanted to keep India out of the frontline. The fact that a paper with such impeccable credentials as the New York Times led the way continues to shock the liberal classes at home.

 Perhaps its time for the New York Times and its ilk to abandon their black-and-white view of the world, and look carefully at all the colours that make up India. Keep the criticism going on Bush and Iraq, but admire him for pursuing his India policy in the face of people like John Bolton ? whom Bush himself appointed to the United Nations.

 Let the paper take note of the fact that it was Bush, as he strode upon the black ramp in front of the ramparts of the Purana Qila on his last evening in Delhi, who spoke about Martin Luther King?s 1959 visit to India. Elsewhere in the world I go as a tourist, Bush said quoting King, but to India I come as a pilgrim.

 If India, now, moderates George W. Bush?s ?if you?re not with us, you?re against us? vision of the world, then so be it. Meanwhile, let us ? and all those at the New York Times ? give the devil its due.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 ALWAYS A VICTIM

 There can be little disagreement with the chairperson of the national commission for women on the need to redefine laws in keeping with changing realities in India. But the reality is often confounding and not as self-evident as Ms Girija Vyas makes it out to be. Based on its perception of what appears to be womens unquestionable victimhood in all situations, the commission has recommended a slew of changes in laws related to adultery and live-in relationships. With respect to the first, it has advised that the act of adultery, and the breach of trust it entails, be treated as a civil offence rather than a criminal one. There is much wisdom in this stipulation. Adultery is a consensual act between a married woman and a man who is not her lawful husband. And the concept of the right to sexual intimacy between consenting adults in private seems to fundamentally disagree with the use of the States force. But the grounds on which Ms Vyas resists the logic of making this a criminal offence particularly for women, as often recommended are not as encouraging. She is averse to holding the adulterous woman equally culpable as the adulterous man because women, she believes, are never offenders. They are always the victims. By saying so, she allows herself to be driven by the same feudal notion of women being devoid of agency or choice that informs attitudes to adultery in the Indian Penal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code. 

 As for the commissions recommendations with regard to live-in relationships, one cannot doubt their contemporary relevance. The recently promulgated Domestic Violence Act, in recognition of this social reality, has sought to protect women against physical and verbal threat in such partnerships. The commission, like the Malimath committee before it, wants the more practical issues to be worked out, especially womens right to property and maintenance in the event of the dissolution of such impermanent domestic arrangements. 

 It goes without saying that the same notion of womens victimhood plays its part here. And once again, Ms Vyas and her commission may be blind to the reality. For the rural and semi-urban areas of India where the practice has been fairly common, and where women often find themselves obliged to live in with married men, the existing law on civil union in India will always make it difficult for the second wife to claim her due shares. That is, unless a child is born out of wedlock who is able to claim its legally recognized rights. There is, however, no denying the value of the commissions efforts to guarantee women security even in less conventional relationships. But much would depend on how the terms of these come to be legally defined.

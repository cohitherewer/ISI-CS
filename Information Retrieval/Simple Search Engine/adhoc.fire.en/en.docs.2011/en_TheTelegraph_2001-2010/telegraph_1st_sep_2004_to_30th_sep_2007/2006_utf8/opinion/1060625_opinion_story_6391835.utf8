 Letters to Editor

 Slipping through the fingers

 Sir ? We often read about the CBI conducting raids against corrupt politicians and bureaucrats to unearth their unaccounted wealth. However, nothing further is heard about the fate of these officials once the operations are over. The cases drag on in courts for years, allowing the guilty to continue in their positions of power and enjoy their ill-gotten wealth. Lalu Prasad, J. Jayalalithaa, Mayavati, Sukh Ram, the list is endless. This kind of tardy action is the reason why the corrupt call the shots in the country.

 Yours faithfully,

C.V.K. Moorthy, Bangalore

 Hero worship

 Sir ? The manner in which the West Bengal government is treating Mukesh Ambani seems to suggest that that he has come to Calcutta for doling charity rather than on business (? Crores and roses for Mukesh?, June 22). Benny Santoso, the executive director of the Salim Group, had also received such royal treatment earlier. What our chief minister fails to understand is that these tycoons will always prioritize their business ventures over the interests of the state. There are many businessmen here in Calcutta who are also interested in contributing to the progress of the state but they are often made to wait for hours before they get to meet the concerned authorities. But when it comes to the Ambanis, the story is different altogether. The state government is bending over backwards to offer business proposals to them. It is indeed surprising to see a communist government following different yardsticks in its treatment of entrepreneurs. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Sir ? It is heartening to note that the Marxists have allowed Mukesh Ambani to do business in West Bengal. This is surely a deviation from their anti-capitalist rhetoric. But the Communist Party of India (Marxist) is still objecting to the entry of foreign direct investment in retail trade. This is surprising as most other state governments interested in attracting business to their states have welcomed FDI in this sector. But Mukesh Ambani is unfazed by all this. He has even complimented the leftists for staying in power for three decades. The fact that a government should be judged by its performance and not by the length of its tenure seems to have escaped this canny businessman.

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Mukesh Ambani?s decision to invest should be welcomed. Ambani?s move will give a fillip to the state?s ailing trade and agriculture. The state government has been criticized for handing over farmland to investors. But such criticism is unwarranted as the peasant community is likely to benefit from Ambani?s largesse. The government should handle such criticism with tact and ensure that the state is flush with funds and investment. The government should remember that it won the assembly elections with a huge mandate and now is the time to keep its promises.

 Yours faithfully,

Kaushik Sen, Calcutta.

 Sir ? Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s enthusiasm for courting business tycoons is a desperate attempt to bring business to his state. However, in his bid to attract investment, the chief minister has flouted some basic guidelines such as inviting tenders for business proposals.This might have dangerous consequences as such reckless acts increase chances of financial irregularities in business ventures. Not just that, this would also set a bad precedence in a democracy such as ours where there are rules to ensure fair competition and transparency.

 Yours faithfully,

P. Mookerjee, Calcutta

 COUNT DOWN

 If wishes were horses, they could at least be counted, if not ridden. And if wishes are votes, as the democratic system assures citizens they are, then all votes should be counted to discern the wishes of the majority. The crosspatch who does not like any candidate, and the cynic who abstains because he thinks the whole exercise is futile, are citizens with as much weight as the enthusiastic voter. But, by a peculiar twist of logic, the votes that refuse to elect anyone were never considered in the counting, although the paper ballot could be spoilt to register rejection ? to the brief satisfaction of the citizen. The electronic voting machine was, therefore, given no button by which to register rejection of all the candidates or parties. In 2004, the Election Commission had proposed for the first time that an option, ?none of the above?, be added to the EVMs. Politicians shuffled, bureaucrats prepared objections ? and the proposal was not implemented. The new chief election commissioner, Mr N. Gopalaswami, has brought up the subject again. 

 The CEC would like to recognize the citizen?s right to the ?negative vote?, or the right not to choose anyone. He has mentioned this in the context of the various reforms he would like to institute in his term as chief. All of these are earlier EC proposals. One of the most important ? and contentious ? issues has been that of election expenditure, and Mr Gopalaswami has mentioned the need to rein in expenditure. But the issue of the ?negative vote? is important in a different way ? its thrust is towards the perfecting of the democratic system. The CEC has also brought up the question of vote proportions, by which only the candidate who has got more than half of the total votes polled can be declared victorious. This, taken with the proposal of recognizing the ?negative vote?, would make radical changes in the ?first-past-the-post? system. 

 In the first place, the presence of the ?negative vote?, which can only happen with the addition of the relevant button to the EVM, should alter the way victory and defeat are calculated. Just getting a vague picture of the number of dissatisfied voters would be pointless. But the altered methods of calculation would symbolize much profounder changes. For one, ?winning? would become more difficult. Parties and their candidates would be unable to avoid looking directly at a countable image of their failure, and total rejection would also mean a condemnation of certain kinds of political behaviour and ethics. Anything that enforces accountability is an improvement. On a broader view, the ?negative vote? would help provide a more ideal representation of people?s choices, while upholding the freedom of not choosing. A democracy would evolve and grow stronger as it learns to cope with the paradoxes at the heart of its principles.

 LETTER AND SPIRIT

 Whose business is it to protest against Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code and to demand that it be struck down? The very definition of civil society as an agent of social change depends on the answer to this question. Section 377 criminalizes adult, consensual homosexual activity and relationships and, therefore, should the onus of protest be simply on homosexuals? Should straight Indians have anything to do with such a political movement at all? A powerfully radical answer has been given to this question by an open letter published in the media by eminent Indians asking the government, courts and Indian citizens to join voices in overturning this archaic and oppressive law. Such an expression of collective responsibility brings two crucial elements into this battle against sexual injustice. First, this is not just the homosexuals problem, but the disgrace of such a law should be the concern of every Indian, irrespective of sexual orientation. Second, what is at stake in this situation is not simply a matter of private sexual activity, but a fundamental undermining of democratic values. These values are enshrined not only in the Indian Constitution, but also in the binding international laws that India has embraced, most notably the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

 For the Indian mainstream, it must be startling to see some of its icons of respectable eminence endorsing, in no uncertain terms, the injustice of such a law. The open letter comes with a covering letter from Mr Amartya Sen, who makes it clear that he does not, as a general rule, sign joint letters, but has made an exception in this case, prompted by the urgency and universality of the cause. The one thing that did not matter to the signatories, hundreds of them from every walk of life, is their own sexual preference. They all believe that 377 should go, and that India would be a more civilized nation without it.

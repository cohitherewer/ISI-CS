 Letters to Editor

 Delayed action

 Sir It is hard to believe that a fun-loving person like Navjyot Singh Sidhu could beat a person so hard that he would lose his life (Sidhu gets jail and time to appeal, Dec 7). Nevertheless, after a wait of 18 years, the victims family seems to have got justice. Sidhu has been sentenced to three years rigorous imprisonment. A fine of Rs 1 lakh has also been imposed on him. But, given the serious nature of the crime, is the punishment meted out to Sidhu adequate? A fine of Rs 1 lakh is not such a big amount for a celebrity like him. Nor is the three-year prison sentence strict enough. Sidhu will never be able to undo the harm he has caused. So his punishment ought to have been commensurate with the crime committed.

 Yours faithfully,

Bijita Roy, Calcutta

 Sir The long-awaited verdict against former cricketer and sitting member of parliament, Navjyot Singh Sidhu, is evidence of the effectiveness of Indias judicial system. The legal machinery in the country seems to have come of age as even legislators themselves are not being spared. The verdict also shows that justice delayed is not necessarily justice denied. Besides, the high-visibility of the case, given the involvement of a cricket personality like Sidhu, made it all the more necessary to have justice delivered to the victims. 

 His public image should have made Sidhu behave more responsibly and show enough restraint during the altercation with Gurnam Singh at Patiala in 1988. But, secure of the weight his social stature carried, Sidhu must have got carried away. The verdict against him will perhaps teach potential offenders the consequences of such hot-headedness. However, ways should be devised to minimize the time taken by the courts to pronounce a verdict. This would reduce the chances of the accused manipulating the judicial process and give a sense of security to the ordinary citizens.

 Yours faithfully,

J. Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir The objective of imprisoning a convicted criminal is two-fold. One, to correct the person and make him a useful member of society, and two, to deter potential criminals. The first objective is hardly ever served, as prison-life makes the convict either a hardened criminal or a cynic. The prison term for Navjyot Singh Sidhu thus seems to be pointless. He is not a criminal who needs to be reformed. His was a crime of passion that involved physical assault, but this was not pre-meditated. The victim, Gurnam Singh, died of heart attack that resulted from the assault, but not of the assault itself. Justice would be done if Sidhu were made to pay a suitable monetary compensation to Gurnam Singhs family and do community service. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Distinctly different

 Sir Sujan Dutta makes some fundamental mistakes while drawing a parallel between Ireland and Kashmir (A tale of two borders, Dec 10). First, the partition of India did not involve the division of three major Indian states but only two Punjab and Bengal. The so-called Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir was the result of an invasion of Kashmir by Pakistan and Pakistan-inspired tribal irregulars in 1948. Second, Northern Ireland was created in 1920 by the British after the Government of Ireland Act was passed. The population of the six counties comprising Northern Ireland was two-thirds Protestant and one-third Roman Catholic. This demographic profile was the direct consequence of the plantation policy of the British government followed in the 17th and 18th centuries. During this time, poor Protestant farmers, mainly from Scotland and western England, were encouraged to settle in what is now Northern Ireland. It was created mainly to safeguard the interests of this majority population of Unionists or Loyalists. The troubles of Northern Ireland have primarily risen from the conflict between Catholics and Protestants, with the British government playing a role mainly by default. A parallel can be found in the recent Shia-Sunni conflict in Iraq. But in Kashmir, after the removal of the Pandit population, the conflict is directly with the Indian state. Kashmirs case is thus different.

 Yours faithfully,

Subha P. Mookerjee, Calcutta 

 Sir There is simply no similarity between Northern Ireland and Kashmir. The former problem was an act of colonization. The latter was created by Jawaharlal Nehru when he ordered a unilateral ceasefire during the 1947-48 war and took the case to the United Nations. Had Nehru not intervened in such a dubious manner, there would have been no Kashmir problem at all. 

 Yours faithfully,

J.K. Dutt, Calcutta

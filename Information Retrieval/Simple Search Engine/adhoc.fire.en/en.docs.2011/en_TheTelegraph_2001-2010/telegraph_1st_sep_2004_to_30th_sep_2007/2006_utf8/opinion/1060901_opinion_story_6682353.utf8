 SONG SUNG BLUE

 Songs are usually sung by the happy, the sad, the devout or the lovelorn. Sometimes, in circumstances that are either dangerous or absurd (or both), they are sung because politicians want them sung. It is Indias singular misfortune that even after being a democracy for six decades, the nation continues to be treated like a classroom frozen in a state of adolescent rebellion. Is the senseless situation that has been created around the singing of Vande Mataram dangerous or absurd? Perhaps it is both. It is absurd because the chain of events that has brought the matter to such a pass is held together by high-thinking and officious banalities. Mr Arjun Singhs initial bright idea of making all the schools sing it on its supposed anniversary was prompted by faulty arithmetic and dubious history. The manner in which he communicated this idea was ambiguous, resulting in some sort of confusion as to whether the singing was optional or mandatory. His subsequent clarifications then led to a few Muslim clerics resurrecting an old controversy. And that was enough to set the Bharatiya Janata Party off on its vintage tricks.

 The party leaderships edict to all the BJP-ruled states was taken most seriously in Chhattisgarh, fomenting further conflict between community and political leaders. Mr Rajnath Singh then stepped in by suggesting, outrageously, that two hundred Muslims from the BJPs minorities morcha would line up in front of Mahatma Gandhis portrait in the parliament and sing the song in chorus. This was apparently a spontaneously expressed wish on the part of these good men. The icing on the cake has now been provided by none other than Mr Narendra Modi, who saw in this situation the perfect chance to display to his state, and to the nation, his moderate and liberal views on how Muslims should behave in order to prove their patriotism. Mr Modi does not want them to be forced to sing. At some point in this sequence, the absurd has begun to slide towards the dangerous. To try to unify diverse masses of people, who have different notions of displaying public and private sentiments, under a single, musically-induced emotion dictated from above, is an attempt at integration that most sensible people would not find innocuous. To make the young sing out in love for their country by issuing stern circulars is state power perhaps at its most ridiculous.

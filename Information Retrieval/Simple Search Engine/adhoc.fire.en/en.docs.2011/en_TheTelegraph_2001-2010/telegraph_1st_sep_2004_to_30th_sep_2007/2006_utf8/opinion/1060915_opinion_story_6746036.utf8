 WORLD ROLE

 A great nation is nothing without a great vision for itself. Indias first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, realized this almost instinctively. His foreign policy was driven by the vision of making India a major player in world affairs. In his time, the world was divided into two hostile and frozen blocs. Accepting this reality, Nehru conceived of the non-aligned movement where countries that refused to belong to either of the blocs came together to discuss and put forward their own interests. The movement carried the stamp of Nehrus, and therefore of Indias, leadership. Nehru and his successors, especially Indira Gandhi, dissipated this advantage by moving closer to the Soviet Union and by failing to condemn the latters invasion of Hungary and Czechoslovakia. As a consequence, the non-aligned movement lost its credibility and then became irrelevant when the Soviet bloc collapsed and the Cold War ended. A non-aligned movement in a unipolar world is something of an anomaly. Most of the critical issues in world affairs are decided today according to the wishes of the United States of America. The rest of the world has very little option save accepting this state of affairs. But this apparent lack of choice can be used by India to create a new forum for some nations.

 Such a forum should not become an anti-US instrument. Rather it should concentrate on issues of common interests, which are not always best served by remaining tied to uncle Sams apron strings. There are countries in Asia, Africa and South America which will happily come together once the idea of such a forum is mooted. India, given its growing economic power and the trust it has earned from the US because of its stand against religious militancy and fundamentalism and because of its responsibility as a nuclear power, can take the leadership in forming such a forum. This will enable India and its policy-makers to break away from the obsession with Pakistan that has become the hallmark of Indias foreign policy. If India wants to have a role in world affairs, it must think of the world and not just about Pakistan. There is the opportunity of playing such a role, if the makers of Indian foreign policy forced themselves to see beyond their noses. This is where Nehru deserves to be emulated. Will India rise to the challenge? Or is it satisfied to remain a south Asian power?

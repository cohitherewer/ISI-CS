 WHEN HUNGER IS PAST

Malvika Singh

 Jammu, 30 years down the road, has lost the Tawi river, which is now close to becoming a nullah. The loss for the city and the people is a symbol of what lies ahead for the entire country ? a shortage of water that will lead to water wars in the future. We tend to ignore the gross degradation of nature. We use short-term methods to ?develop?. We are careless and unthinking about conservation and we just do not address the real issues that will hold this country to ransom. As our population explodes we have some idea of when it will peak. The belief is that 2020 will be the watershed year. By then, hunger will have been conquered and there will be a violent search for the elixir of life, water.

 As the economic boom leads to all-round prosperity in rural and urban India, demands of life will also change. Showers will replace bucket baths, more water will be consumed as people begin to bathe twice a day. The consumption of water will rise dramatically. Water tables will drop. This is a small and what appears to be an inconsequential example of why resources could be depleted. There are endless others like irrigation of agricultural lands, drinking water, and such like. The sources of water are being polluted. The topographical requirement that is intrinsic to healthy catchment areas is being abused without check. There is a mindless madness that is running amuck and governments are unable to stop the destruction for reasons best known to them.

 Water wars

 The predictable argument in favour of all the illegal intrusions and destruction of the natural habitat is that ?environmentalists? are against development and therefore growth. This is nonsense because environmentalists are only bringing the problem into focus for those who rule to set in place correctives as well as new methodologies of conservation, which can also lead to the ?growth? of water and water bodies. And that brings me to the alternatives. Water conservation should be mandatory in all colonies and for all residential areas for a start. Municipalities should put water on the top of their agenda, they should be put through refresher courses that tell them some horror stories of what the future has in store if they continue to operate the way they have been doing. This way, societal commitments will compel governments to correct their mindsets.

 A new generation with new values, aspirations and lifestyle and a new attitude towards development will be prepared to use creative ideas to restore all that will make their lives healthier and happier. If some of these younger men and women were inducted into political governance, these critically degraded and exploited areas would get corrected as ?top priority?. Smaller towns and state capitals have an energy that few have bothered to recognize, let alone assess. 

 Much is happening. Education has become an important ingredient in the building of towns and cities. Where the governments of the last 58 years let down India private players have entered the field and are delivering the goods in the urban space. Health centres are bound to follow as the abysmal condition of medicare affects this generation and its children. Political sloganmongering and rhetoric are now pass?. The paradigm has to shift. The old ideology is retaining the poverty level in some areas. Because it refuses to step out of its archaic intellectual constraints, to experiment with new thinking, it is stunting this subcontinent. 

 Fortunately, there is a vibrant change happening across the board. One often wonders whether Indian politicians and their administrators deliberately kept India in poverty for their own survival, because a healthy and educated India will never tolerate the malgovernance and exploitation that has tied us up in knots for decades.

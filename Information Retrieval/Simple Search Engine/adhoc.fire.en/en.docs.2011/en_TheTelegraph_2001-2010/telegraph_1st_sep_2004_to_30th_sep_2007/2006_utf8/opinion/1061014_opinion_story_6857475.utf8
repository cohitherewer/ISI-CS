 Down the drain

 Sir Dalhousie Square will soon be given a facelift (The north-south kit, Oct 7) . The footpaths would be paved in granite and expensive cast-iron lamps installed. Such a move defies all logic, as many parts of Calcutta are now struggling with potholed roads, broken pavements, clogged sewers, and overflowing garbage. Water-logging has also led to the spread of dreaded diseases like malaria and dengue. It is shocking to see the city fathers busy wasting funds on beautification drives, forgetting other pressing matters that lie unattended.

 Yours faithfully, 

 A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

 Freedom cry

 Sir The countrywide ban on child labour will ring the death knell for those living below the poverty line. In an over populated country such as ours, such utopian schemes are more likely to fail than succeed. Consider the following. Under the amended Act, it is now illegal to employ children below the age of 14 as domestic help, or in eateries, spas and gyms in addition to all other places where it was prohibited earlier. But there is no way to ascertain the exact age of child labourers as most of them do not have birth certificates. Instead of banning child labour, the government should take steps to improve the working conditions in industries that employ children. The ban would also lead to an increase in the number of children turning to begging or petty crimes to make a living. 

 To stop child labour, the government should direct employers to screen the birth certificates of employees carefully. Politicians and local leaders should also keep a watch on individuals employing children and arrange for the rehabilitation of the victims of this malpractice. In this case, it should be mentioned that people like Gul Panag or Shabana Azmi can do little to eliminate child labour. Celebrities often lend their name to a cause to attain fame and popularity. The government should think twice before asking the rich and the famous to do their bit for the cause. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Mukherjee, Burdwan

 Sir The report, Stars for toiling child(Oct10), reiterates a universal truth: public faith in Bollywood is stronger than in labour law authorities. That it took such a long time to free under-age children from the clutches of a medieval practice clearly indicates the lack of a political resolve to tackle the menace. The government needs to mete out stringent punishment to those who force children to work for a living. Moreover, the shortage of labour inspectors should not come in the way of implementing the law, provided human society becomes more sensitive to the suffering of toiling children. If not, the Act will remain an example of another failed attempt to eradicate a social evil.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta 

 Sir Child labour continues to pose a problem before the nation. As long as India remains a poor country, there will be no end to the practice of employing young children in households and eateries among other places. This is borne out by the ground reality which is far from encouraging. Today, children can be found working in tobacco processing units, cracker factories and other hazardous industries. Some of them also work as domestic help and rag pickers. The government had passed the Child Labour (prohibition and regulation) Act to ensure that children are not employed in a hazardous environment in 1986. A year later, a National Policy on Child Labour was framed to rehabilitate child labourers. But all these attempts failed to have the desired effect. Hopefully, the blanket ban would help in freeing these children from their fetters.

 Yours faithfully,

 Agnibesh Banerjee,

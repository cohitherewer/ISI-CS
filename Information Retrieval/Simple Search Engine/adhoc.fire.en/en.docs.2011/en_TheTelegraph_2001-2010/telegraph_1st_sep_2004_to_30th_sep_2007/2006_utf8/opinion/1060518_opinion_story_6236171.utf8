 NEW PRAYER

 Praying could have been a simple matter, if organized religion would allow it. The decision of the new Tamil Nadu government, led by the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam chief, Mr M. Karunanidhi, to allow people of all castes to become temple priests if properly ?qualified and trained?, mounts an attack on at least one exclusivist area of organized worship. A country in which caste wars still happen and caste-segregation is perfectly normal in many regions, a breakdown of caste barriers in temple priesthood is a remarkable achievement. In the politics of the Dravidian movement, this is an old goal, favoured by E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker, and Mr Karunanidhi had already enacted a law to this effect in 1970. The Supreme Court, which had then struck it down, had again, in 2002, ruled against the ?archaic and unjust practice of reserving Hindu priesthood on the basis of birth and caste?. So the world has changed since 1970, although that does not mean that there are now fewer conservatives, especially among Hindu priests. However, the DMK-led government can now open up the doors of all the temples under the state?s Hindu religious and charitable endowments department to priests of all castes. The Brahmins suddenly have competition.

 The best indication of the layered and overlapping forms of social and political power that underlie temple worship is the fact that politics, governance and the law are all embroiled in bringing about what appears to be a logical reform. And an idealistic one. As reform, it is certainly welcome, but it is also rather interesting from two points of view. Many Hindu temples deny entry to certain castes, or to non-Hindus. The caste segregation may have lessened, but it is still there in many places. Non-Brahmin priests would raise expectations of a secular approach towards devotees. And how far would this reform spread? The other point regards the content of those shastras which categorically disallow any caste but Hindu Brahmins the right to sacred texts and words. Can there be such a reform without the consequent dismantling of the hierarchical structure of sacred texts and of the specialized ordering of rituals? The logic of the reform is most interesting, raising questions about the future nature of temple worship and about the evolution of a multi-text faith.

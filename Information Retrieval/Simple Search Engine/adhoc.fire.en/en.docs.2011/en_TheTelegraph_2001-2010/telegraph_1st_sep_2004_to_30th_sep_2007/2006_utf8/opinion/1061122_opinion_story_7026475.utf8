 THE DECLINE OF SCIENTIFIC REASONING

 The tradition of science and technology in India lost its edge after the scientific revolution in Europe, writes Partha Ghose

 Science in India is facing a serious crisis just when its economy is growing and its knowledge resources are getting widely recognized. The brightest minds are no longer drawn to the pure sciences, and Indias research contributions in this area are showing signs of decline, both in quantity and in quality. 

 I am reminded of a panel discussion during the Fifth Asia-Pacific Physics Conference in Kuala Lumpur in August, 1992. Malaysia was then facing a somewhat similar problem. The panel was chaired by C.N. Yang, a famous Chinese physicist who won the Nobel Prize in 1957. In his concluding remarks, he said he was convinced that science and technology would take roots only in those societies who have traditionally valued learning. And he said he knew only two societies in the Asia-Pacific region which satisfied that criterion China and India. To what extent is this true of India?

 Contrary to popular belief, science and technology is neither of European nor of Vedic origin. It was some 5,000 years ago, much before the Vedic age, that the first cities of southeast Asia were established in the Indus Valley, more or less at the same time as the first cities in Egypt and in Mesopotamia. This Harappan civilization lasted until about 1300 BC, and was spread over a vast area. The remains of the great cities at Mohenjodaro, Harappa and several other places were all built on a perfect grid pattern aligned exactly north-south, with high quality bricks of standard sizes (in the ratio 4:2:1) and many geometric shapes. Needless to say, all this would have been impossible without a very high level of knowledge of science, particularly geometry, arithmetic and astronomy. The Harappans followed the decimal system of measurement for all practical purposes, including the measurement of mass as revealed by their hexahedron weights. Unfortunately, much is still unknown about this civilization because their script remains undeciphered. 

 After a gap of almost a thousand years, astronomy and mathematics, particularly trigonometry and algebra, developed further and grew to quite sophisticated levels in India, China and Greece approximately between 500 BC and 700 AD. The most remarkable Indian mathematician-astronomers of this period were Aryabhatta (476-550 AD), Varahamihira (505-587 AD) and Brahmagupta (598-670 AD). They wrote major astronomical works called Aryabhatiya, Pancasiddhantika (a compendium of Greek, Egyptian, Roman and Indian astronomy) and Brahma Sphuta Siddhanta, which were to influence all future developments in astronomy and mathematics. They contained the place-value numerical system and the use of zero, pi as an irrational number, mensuration and trigonometry, motion of the planets, the concept of gravity, the relativity principle, Diophantine equations, and a host of other important technical matters.

 Then, starting around 750 AD, science began to flourish in the Arab world under the Abbasid caliphs of Baghdad who encouraged intellectual freedom. It gradually spread its influence as far west as Spain and eastwards into Central Asia, over a period of more than 600 years. The famous king, Khalif Abbasid Al Mansoor (712775), founded Baghdad and made it a centre of learning. He invited a scholar named Kanka from Ujjain and had Brahmaguptas Brahma Sphuta Siddhanta translated into Arabic by Al Fazaii. It was through this translation that the Arabs first learnt of Indian mathematics and astronomy. Drawing on a variety of Greek, Indian and Persian texts and translating them into Arabic, these Arab scholars accumulated a huge body of scientific knowledge and built on it through their own discoveries.

 It took another thousand years for all this scientific knowledge to reach Europe through Latin translations of the Arabic works around the time of the European Renaissance (14th-16th century AD). Europe had been under the spell of Greek philosophy and mathematics and medieval Christian theology for a thousand years. It was only during the time of Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo and Newton (15th-18th century AD) that the scientific revolution took place in Europe, giving birth to modern science. The key feature that distinguished this revolution from all previous developments was its emphasis on controlled experiments and precise measurements backed up by the hypothetico-deductive method coupled with mathematical description. The paradigm created by Newton and Galileo for physics and astronomy became the model that all other branches of the natural sciences attempted to emulate. There was a great flowering of the natural sciences mechanics, optics, acoustics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, chemistry which underpinned the Industrial Revolution in Britain during the 18th- and early 19th-centuries. 

 Not only did the pure sciences play a key role in Europes rise to dominance, they have ever since remained the bases for sustained development and domination throughout the western world. The 20th-century brought about several new technologies like wireless communication, nuclear technology, microelectronics, chemical and pharmaceutical technology, laser technology, medical technology, space technology and information technology. These would not have happened so speedily had it not been for the two scientific revolutions that took place in the first quarter of the century, namely relativity (required for Global Positioning Systems and nuclear power) and quantum theory (required for atomic and molecular chemistry, molecular biology, laser technology, solid state electronic devices and so on). And most of the basic research was carried out in excellent universities in Europe and the United States of America.

 Although India had a head start over Europe in mathematics and science and technology, it lost out to Europe after the scientific revolution. There could have been several reasons for this. One school of thought would attribute this entirely to the divorce of the hands from the mind encouraged by the caste system and Brahmanism in India. The repeated conquests of the country by foreigners that took place could also have contributed to this decline. When Bakhtiar Khilji destroyed Nalanda in the 12th-century AD, it was a university campus spread over some 21 square miles and had 10,000 students and 1500 teachers. The central library, housing numerous texts written by great scholars, burnt for more than six months.

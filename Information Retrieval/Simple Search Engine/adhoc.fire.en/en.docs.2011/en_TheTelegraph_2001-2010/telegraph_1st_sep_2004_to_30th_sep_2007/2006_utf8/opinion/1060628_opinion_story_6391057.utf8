 WHAT WE OWE TO THE BAT AND BALL

Stephen Hugh-Jones

 Jim Laker in action

 OK, football is king: just listen to the World Cup roars from Germany. But not in all ways.

 Do you remember the days of a sticky wicket? Rain soaks the pitch; sunshine then dries it; and while it does so, the batsmen are caught on a gluepot by the spin bowlers. Now that pitches are covered, it hardly happens in first-class cricket these days. But ancient fans may recall Jim Laker in 1956 taking ten Australian wickets in a single Test innings this way.

 Such events were typically English, thanks to the British climate. But the sticky wicket metaphor is used worldwide (at least wherever cricket is played, so don?t tell George Bush he?s been caught on one in Iraq, or you?ll probably end up at Guantanamo for speaking an unknown foreign lingo). Our language owes much to sport.

 You may thus be stumped by some question or caught out, and even Americans will understand you. You may equally be stymied, a metaphor also banished from high-level play now that golfers pick up their ball to avoid obstructing their opponent?s. Or your answer may hit the bull, as archers do.

 From boxing we have below the belt and a knockout blow; and at least in Britain, politicians love to assure voters that the country, wisely guided by guess whom, is punching above its weight. Businessmen worried by foreign competitors demand a level playing field: a daft metaphor, given that any field is equally unlevel for both sides, but widely used.

 To test some critic?s (or friend?s) reaction, Victorian prime ministers would cast a fly over him; a modern one, in these days of mass democracy, flies a kite. If supporters hesitate, he will try to bring them on side; but if the idea thus launched still does not catch on, he may kick it into touch.

 From tennis we have the ball is in your court; from fox-hunting gone to earth or to ground; from racing the going and the winning post. Aircraft touch down because, long before the Wright brothers, players of rugby or American football do so.

 So where are the metaphors from what the rest of us call football, not just the most widespread of Britain?s sporting exports to the world but far the most popular in its birthplace?

 The world has indeed adopted its vocabulary. Spanish- or Portuguese-speaking commentators specialize in a long, diminuendo, howl of go-o-o-o-o-o-l, and many other terms have gone straight into umpteen tongues. Likewise, English-sounding club names abound: Argentina?s two fiercest rivals are the Buenos Aires clubs Boca Juniors and, not ?Rio de la Plata?, but River Plate.

 Yet football?s gifts to its home tongue have been few. Into touch began life in rugby. So did on side, and its metaphorical sense anyway is one that neither game would recognize. Young men may make a pass but they do it at young women, not to their male friends. The only footie metaphor I can think of is a very British one: an own goal.

 As a (non-Scottish) Briton, I hope that?s not a World Cup prophecy.

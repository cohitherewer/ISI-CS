 LOGIC OF OFFICE

 If the horse goes in an undesirable direction, the cart just has to be put before it. That is no problem in the Indian parliament, where abrasive exchanges over who holds an office of profit have led to an adjournment of the budget session. Apparently, an amendment to the Parliament (Prevention of Disqualification) Act, 1959 has to be rushed through with a new list of exemptions from the office of profit badge. Since no bill can be rushed, it must be an ordinance, and no ordinance can be passed while the houses are in session. But these convolutions look innocent when compared to the dizzying contortions and somersaults, the exemptions and accusations, that punctuate the history of the office of profit clause in the list of reasons for disqualification of legislators. It is less the principle than the politics it inspires that makes it remarkable: if Ms Jaya Bachchan cannot be a member of parliament because she is chief of the Uttar Pradesh film development council, neither can Ms Sonia Gandhi, because she is chairperson of the national advisory council.

 The whole exercise is pointless and distracting. The Constitution does not say what this damning office of profit is, only that parliament alone can make exemptions. Hence state exemptions ? the most recent being the list in UP made to protect Ms Bachchan ? clash with Central lists, like the proposed ordinance to exempt some MPs now vulnerable to the opposition?s fury. There is a myopic, or politically convenient, unwillingness to confront the reality that the separation of powers, the principle from which the warning against an office of profit springs, cannot be maintained in its purity. Lawmakers cannot remain only lawmakers, even in the United States of America, which does try to stick to the separation. In approving appointments, for example, Congressmen appropriate an executive function. By the logic of separation, legislators cannot be ministers. India tries to slip past that one by perceiving the executive function as a part of legislation. 

 What is needed is a clear definition of what the term means. The parliament?s silence on the matter forces the courts to move case by case, sometimes deciding that a monthly honorarium with accommodation makes for an ?office of profit? and sometimes that compensatory allowances for transport, for example, do not. In a state where the public sector is such an important part of the economy, it is impractical to debar MPs and ministers from holding positions on boards and councils. Instead of alarms and alarums, the parliament should work out precisely what they are to be allowed in those positions, that is, what constitutes a conflict of interests, to prevent them from being disqualified. Efficiency and clarity might take away a useful political weapon, but they would remove all confusion in the long run.

 Letters to Editor

 War efforts

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Daily trip?(July13), sounds a clarion call for the government. Any terrorist group as well-organized as the one that conspired to carry out the attacks in Mumbai must have had camps in several places of the country where they received support from local groups. This means that terrorists manage to preserve their anonymity here, intermingling with the crowd, and can look out for opportune moments to strike. While it may be difficult to anticipate a terrorist attack, it is not entirely impossible to detect and destroy the support base here. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shyamal K. Sinha, Calcutta

 Sir ? The Indian establishment has perfected a standard play for the media and the people every time a Pakistan-sponsored terrorist strike takes place. It asserts that the act is cowardly and that India will never be cowed down by terrorism. An odd neta ambles across to the target city, makes the appropriate noises and offers financial compensation to victims and their families. The opposition condemns the lapse and the West is then roundly blamed for not reining in Pakistan. The government invariably says that the peace process with the neighbours will ?continue? despite the provocations. Meanwhile, target city is left to fend for itself. To suffer violence inflicted by Pakistan has become part of our national psyche. The only way to eliminate trans-border terrorism is by destroying the terrorist camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Bangladesh with precision guided munition. However, to do this, we would need an infusion of young blood in the government.

 Yours faithfully,

J. Kumar Dutt, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is a pity that the Union home minister, Shivraj Patil, has not resigned or been removed from his post despite the major security lapses that culminated in the terror attacks in Srinagar and Mumbai. Both the United Progressive Alliance and its chairperson, Sonia Gandhi, owe an explanation to the public for the inadequate security measures in the country. India should follow in the footsteps of the United States of America and appoint a homeland security-in-charge in all the states. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Blaming the US or Pakistan for terrorist activities in India will hardly serve any purpose. The precision with which the killers were able to strike in Srinagar and Mumbai clearly shows that this is a case of intelligence failure, which raises some inevitable questions. Are our intelligence officers properly trained and equipped? Do they lack a sincerity of purpose or is it interference from vested interests that is crippling them? The Indian government really cuts a sorry figure. If the leaders fail to show more honesty and responsibility, how can we trust them with the security of the country?

 Yours faithfully,

Manoj Kumar Sinha, Calcutta

 Sir ? If the state can provide round-the-clock security for political leaders, mostly with dubious track records, why can it not defend its innocent civilians? The least India could do is demolish the terrorist bases in PoK. If an attack on the twin towers of the World Trade Center could start a war, why is India still continuing the peace process with Pakistan? 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir ? Terrorism should definitely be condemned. But state action against it does not authorize the police to terrorize the slum dwellers under the pretext of carrying out investigations (?Midnight knock?, July 17). The pathos in the eyes of the relatives waiting outside the police station speaks louder than words of their harassment. Can we not expect a more planned and logical combing operation instead of the intrusion into the homes of the poor and the helpless? 

 Yours faithfully,

Ranadhish Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? The Union home minister has said that the ?low-intensity warfare that the country is facing was likely to continue for sometime? (?Patil keeps mum on Pak?, July 26). The term ?low-intensity warfare? is a deliberate attempt to make light of the recent acts of terrorism. The phrase ?likely to continue for sometime? is also dangerous and means that in case of further assaults on the civilian population, one cannot say that the minister had not forewarned the public. Would our home minister have been so lackadaisical had the life and property of the political fraternity been endangered similarly?

 Yours faithfully,

S.B. Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? Now that the nuclear deal with America is through, India can look forward to more terrorist attacks.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Samaddar, Calcutta

 STAY OUT OF TROUBLE 

 Gwynne Dyer

 On one issue, at least, George Bush and George Clooney are in perfect accord: what is happening in Darfur is genocide, and something must be done about it. But it isnt genocide, and nothing will be done.

 The end-of-September deadline for putting a 20,000-strong force of United Nations troops into Darfur, including large numbers of soldiers drawn from the Nato countries, was always a fantasy. The deadline has passed without any softening of the Sudanese governments total rejection of the plan, and no Western troops are heading for Sudan any time soon. Instead, the existing force from African Union countries that tries to protect the refugee camps will stay on at least until the end of the year.

 This is the best available outcome, and may even save some tens of thousands of lives especially if the Western countries now give that African Union force the money, fuel, night-flying helicopters and other resources it needs to do the job. It will continue to be grim in Darfur, but at least the West has avoided a military intervention in Africa that would have made the Somalia debacle look like a success story.

 Darfur is as big as France, but it has only six million people. They are all black Africans and all Muslims, but some were Arabized long ago, while other groups, notably the Zaghawa and the Fur, have retained their original African languages and ethnic identities. Resources are scarce, and the various groups are often in conflict over them.

 Outside support

 Nevertheless, Darfur remained relatively quiet during the dreadful war between the African ethnic groups of southern Sudan, where most people are Christians or animists, and the Muslims of the Arabized north who dominated the countrys government, army and economy. It was the peace settlement between the north and the south in 2003 that triggered the revolt in Darfur.

 That peace deal gave the southern rebels a share in the central government, a half-share of the oil revenues now pouring in from wells that are mostly located in southern territory, and the right to a referendum on independence from Sudan in six years time. So some leaders of the Zaghawa and the Fur decided to emulate the southerners: launch a revolt in Darfur, and try to cut a similar deal with Khartoum in return for ending it.

 The regime in Khartoum used the same tactic that it had employed in the war with the south: it armed and paid Arabized groups (the Janjaweed militia) to fight the rebels. And just as in the south, the bulk of the victims were innocent civilians. Many people died, and almost half the population fled to refugee camps that sprang up inside Darfur and across the frontier in Chad.

 International aid agencies try to care for the refugees. The African Union also sent a 7,000-strong force to protect them, but none of the foreigners took sides in the fighting. At the peace talks in Abuja, Khartoum offered the rebels posts in the provincial government and a share of the oil revenues, and one rebel group, Minni Minnawis Sudan Liberation Army, accepted the deal. However, two rival groups didnt, and even the SLA split, with breakaway factions joining the rejectionists to form the National Redemption Front.

 Fighting resumed with Minnawis SLA now cooperating with government troops and the Janjaweed against the remaining rebels. Alex de Waal, an advisor to the African Union mediation team at the talks, reckons that another $100 million on the table would have persuaded the rebels to accept the deal. Darfur is not another Rwanda in the making, as the protesters in the West suggest. It is a cruel war of a kind lamentably common in Africa, and the most useful thing non-Africans can do is to support the African Unions mediators and its troops on the ground.

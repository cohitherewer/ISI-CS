 THE WAR WITHIN

 Abhijit Bhattacharyya

 Let us not dwell on George Fernandes for a change, and attempt to trace a brief history of India rsquo;s armament supply instead. About 59 years ago, when the Indian defence budget was small and its needs meagre, none visualized India as an arms market. And understandably. Then, virtually all of India rsquo;s military hardware of the Indian garrison were of British- and French-make. The Indian army had a plethora of regiments following the British military tradition, using the same type of medals and dresses and possessing identical tanks, guns and ammunition. 

 The Indian air force too was no exception. Its inventory continued to be virtually an extension of the Royal Air Force till the advent of the Soviet-made MiG-21 in the Sixties. The only spoiler of the all-British Indian air force happened to be the two French aircraft called Mystere and Ouragon in the Fifties. The rest were English-origin Vampires, Hunters, Folland Gnat, Canberras and so on. In the Fifties, America proved to be an unexpected supplier in the non-combat flight sector. 

 The Indian navy, too, being an auxiliary of the Royal Navy, could not have possessed anything other than the UK-built Swan and Hunt class ships and the Achilles of the Royal Navy. All Indian battleships and battlecruisers perforce were second hand machines.

 In all, the Indian military market remained insignificant. It was a smooth ride with little choice and limited supplies for a peace -loving nation propounding the virtues of Panchsheel. However, 15 years into Independence, the attitude of the Indian leadership changed. Overnight, the perfidy of Indias neighbour brought its complacent military down to its knees. The defence budget got an unprecedented boost, the indigenous military production went on an overdrive and the choice of foreign equipment widened. Thus was born the Soviet-made Foxtrot Submarine squadron in 1967, and the Russians descended in herds with MiGs and Antonovs, Mils submarines and the Ilyushin aircraft. 

 Gun ho!

 Since Russia was a socialist state, and India too was one, the middlemen did not hit the headlines. This was an excellent case of cooperation and co-existence. Moscow and New Delhi were happy with their own performance on the high table of diplomacy.

 The Indo-Pakistan war of 1971, however, saw some changes again.The monopoly of the MiG was broken by the Anglo-French Jaguar, which saw an unprecedented number of allegations and counter-allegations being made in the print media. The Russians were also outbid by the then West German built HDW submarine.

 The biggest controversy, however, was with the Swedish-made Bofors guns, chosen from amongst four defence contractors. Bofors dethroned a political party from power and dispossessed the Pakistani army of Kargil. Bofors controversial legacy is now carried by the Scorpene submarines and the Barak missiles. 

 The Barak controversy once again reveals that the main threat of such allegations is to the national security and the self-respect of the nation. The accusations expose the fault lines of the system. For a country with perpetually unfriendly neighbours in the vicinity, it is an alarming development for the men in uniform. 

 Has anyone thought of the morale of the men who are expected to operate the Barak missiles? Can they have full faith and confidence on their admiral, who could be taken into judicial custody of an investigative agency? First, it was the chairman, central board of excise and customs, and then the Mumbai police commission. Today, the accusing finger is being pointed at a former naval chief and former defence minister. Who next? Can Indias security system survive the systemic failure of the state?

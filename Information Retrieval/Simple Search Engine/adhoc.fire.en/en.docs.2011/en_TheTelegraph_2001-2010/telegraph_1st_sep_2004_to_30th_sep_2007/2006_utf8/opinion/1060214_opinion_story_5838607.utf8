 Watered down

 Sir ? After three decades of anarchical ruling by the Left Front, the chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, now comes up with his brilliant new idea of reviving Calcutta by spending a fortune on an ?underground aquarium? (?Buddha?s Ark hope for Calcutta?, Feb 10). While paucity of government funds has resulted in pitiable public services, Bhattacharjee plans to spend a whopping Rs 500 crore from the taxpayers? money to erect a fishing tank only because it would be the ?first? of its kind in the subcontinent. Large and attractive aquariums are not uncommon in many parts of the world. Does Bhattacharjee seriously believe that foreign tourists would flock to Calcutta only to see an underground aquarium? It seems that the proposed aquarium is nothing but one more ploy intended to lure voters as another election approaches. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kunal Saha, Columbus, US

 Sir ? Should we consider the plan of ?creating? a water world yet another feather in the cap of the Bengal chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee? After returning from every foreign tour our ?do it now? chief minister comes out with some new plan. First it was the leather park after his visit to Italy, the introduction of the Salim Group after Indonesia and now a water world after his return from Singapore. There is no harm in introducing these recreational facilities in Calcutta, but the chief minister should first consider whether the construction of such a park would create employment opportunities in the state. And when clean drinking water is increasingly becoming scarce in Calcutta, this aquarium would require 6 million litres of salt water. The state?s legislators, including ministers from the ruling party, should strongly object to this proposal and call for a debate in the assembly. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta 

 Sir ? It seems quite incredible that a chief minister can have the time, energy and, most of all, the bad taste to propose such a fantastic project as a giant aquarium. Incidentally, how and why does the state fisheries minister get involved in the scheme? Going by the numbers quoted in the report (250 species of sharks, besides thousands of other kinds of fish), is he up to setting some kind of an underground sardine canning factory, to cater to the ever-increasing demand for fish among the Bengalis?

 Yours faithfully, 

S.P. Mookerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s Rs 500 crore-plus dream project, the underground aquarium, will really prove to be a fantasy for the state and the country. This ambitious project, spread over 300 acres of land, with a high maintenance cost, will surely have a high entry fee. As such, the water world will remain out of reach for most Calcuttans. Besides, there is no reason why we should imitate countries like Singapore. Unlike those in Singapore and other affluent cities, the aquarium in Calcutta will be surrounded by squalid streets and slums. Not only is this a meaningless extravagance for a poor state like Bengal but the 300 acres of land could have been better utilized in building housing projects for the low-income groups.

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Sir ? I could not quite agree with the editorial, ?Sharks, dolphins and joy? (Feb 11). While it is unfortunate that the zoological garden of Calcutta is in a miserable state, there is no reason why a world-class underground aquarium should not be built here. Apart from increasing the number of tourists, with a concomitant growth in related areas of activity, adults and children alike will undeniably derive much joy from the proposed marine park. We need projects like these to boost the sagging morale of the city and its people.

 Yours faithfully,

Ashok Ghosh, Calcutta

 Campus threat

 Sir ? The controversy over the dress code in the Aligarh Muslim University is shocking (?Jeans furore in AMU?, Feb 11). The self-styled moral police, who are trying to impose a dress code on women, should remember that there is nothing called a ?pan-Indian? dress. Even the so-called traditional Indian costume, the sari, can reveal as much as it hides. A T-shirt paired with jeans is surely a better option for a young student.

 Yours faithfully,

Amit V. Sengupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? As a student of AMU, I condemn the harassment, if there has been one, of a woman student of the university. It is true, however, that indecent dresses are unacceptable to the conservative students of AMU. But the way the issue has been presented in the media would make one think that eve-teasing has become a trend on the AMU campus. The students? union of JNU, which has taken up the issue, seems more eager to defame AMU than judge the case. 

 Yours faithfully,

Qazi Mohammad Saad, Chapra, Bihar

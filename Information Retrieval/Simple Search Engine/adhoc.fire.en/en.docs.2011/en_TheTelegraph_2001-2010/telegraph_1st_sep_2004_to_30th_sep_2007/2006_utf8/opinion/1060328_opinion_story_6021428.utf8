 MIXED UP

 The time may have come for Ms Mamata Banerjee to face her own failures. If the Congress was forced to spurn her offer of an alliance for the coming elections in Bengal, the fault clearly lay in her impossible strategy. She wanted to have both the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party as her allies. And this despite the Congress maintaining that it cannot join hands with her as long as she stayed in saffron company. There was no ambiguity in this stand. Ms Banerjee?s formula, on the other hand, smacked of political chicanery. It was an unrealistic political move that was doomed to fail. But Ms Banerjee does not seem to have learnt the art of learning from mistakes. In fact, she has compounded her frustration with another false step. Her criticism of the Congress president, Ms Sonia Gandhi, on her resignation from the Lok Sabha, was not only unwarranted but also politically unwise. It has had the predictable reaction of upsetting Congressmen in Bengal. Her indiscretion can only deepen the mutual mistrust between the Congress and the Trinamool Congress and add a new dimension to the blame game between the two for the failure of the attempted alliance. All that would be music to the ears of the leftists. 

 The rift, and the advantage it may give to the left in the polls, raise a basic question about her politics. She had left the Congress, alleging that the party?s leadership in Bengal was not interested in seriously fighting the left. Nine years after she had done so, events have proved that her rebellion had hurt the Congress much more than it harmed the Marxists. True, she had sought to repair the damage by allying with the Congress in the assembly elections in Bengal in 2001. The alliance was struck too late to make any difference to the left in those polls. Ms Banerjee may have made another mistake thereafter by returning to the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance. The coming elections offered her yet another opportunity to make amends. She missed it once again by staying on with the BJP, which has a negligible presence in the state. She had gambled on forcing the Congress to accept her terms for an alliance and failed. Political logic would suggest that she can fight her battle best by returning to the parent party and making it a real alternative to the left. The question is whether she can be bold enough to accept her mistakes and to make a new beginning.

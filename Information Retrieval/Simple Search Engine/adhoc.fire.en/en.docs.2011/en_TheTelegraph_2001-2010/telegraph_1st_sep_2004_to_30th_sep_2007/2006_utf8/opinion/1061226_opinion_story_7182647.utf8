 THE BABU AND HIS DOINGS

 MALVIKA SINGH

 As institutional degradation takes on immense proportions and becomes uncontrollable, much is being lost forever. Once again, the bureaucrats are to blame for the whittling away of great museum collections, archival material, treasures that are testimony to the cultural pasts of this land and the natural environment. Their lack of knowledge and understanding, peppered with arrogance and a masterful ability to stall and procrastinate because they hold the power to do so, have allowed India to dissolve into a state of utter ineptitude and corruption. 

 Crores of rupees have been doled out over the decades for actions that would help India rise out of the mire of poverty, but the incompetence of the babus, particularly their subservience to the political masters, has led this country into a knotted mess that will take a lot of commitment and energy to undo. If they were to begin by trying to eradicate corruption, they would have to change their lifestyle and their values to restore the basic requirements of good governance.

 Government rules, regulations, demands and laws would have to be distilled down to the bare minimum, thereby allowing ordinary citizens to comply without cluttering their plate with endless addenda that contradict one another. The income tax department should become the first institution to undergo this cleansing. It would make the unsuspecting and honest citizen secure in the belief that he is not being taken for a ride by the officers in charge and it would most definitely compel clean compliance sans bribery and corruption. Manmohan Singh understands this better than most and must resolve to clean up the operation even if it means mass suspensions of public servants from office.

 No easy cure

 Then there are those endless law enforcement agencies which have reached levels of incompetence and impropriety that make the mind boggle. An honest police force would make life worth living in this nation of ours. If someone could revert the police into their designated role of being there to protect the honest, exploited citizen and not assist the law- breaker who has money and muscle power, we would begin our journey towards becoming a true superpower. Alas, we are in a situation that is not much different from a banana republic. Our armed forces, that were known and celebrated for being apolitical and clean, are today being sullied by increasing examples of deviation from the law book. This is another scary reality.

 The list of horrors is unending. But what is most disturbing and without an immediate or easy cure, is the intellectual level and narrow knowledge base of those who administer us. Education systems that force the yes/no answers, produce vast masses of unthinking, non-reading, and robot-like men and women with limited general knowledge who, nevertheless, attain positions of power to determine right and wrong, who are ill-equipped to interpret changing economic, social, cultural and political realities, and who finally reduce society into anarchy. Limited knowledge is far more deadly than no knowledge at all. It is akin to placing dynamite along the paths we trod. And the arrogance of limited minds and intellect is the poison that destroys cultures. We in India seem to be going through the painful process of learning that truth.

 This dumbing down is dangerous, leaving this civilization open to intrusions that could be destructive. As new opportunities grow, young men and women move away from being babus, yielding to fresh aspirations to change their lives. What was once the bastion of the best and brightest has reduced itself to the worst, having diluted the standards of propriety, governance and intellectual endeavour. That is the tragedy of the administrative machine in 2006.

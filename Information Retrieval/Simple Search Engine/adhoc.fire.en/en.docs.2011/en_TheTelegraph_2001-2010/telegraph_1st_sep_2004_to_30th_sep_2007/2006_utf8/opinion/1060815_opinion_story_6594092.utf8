 Under Pressure

Truly down under

 Sir The reference by the former Australian test player, Dean Jones, to the South African batsman, Hashim Amla, as a terrorist, is shocking to say the least (Terrorist gets Dean fired, August 8). At a time when people all over the world are trying to come to terms with the brutal face of terrorism, such comments display a singular lack of sensitivity and propriety. Yet it also helps to drive home the bitter truth that the Muslim community continues to be considered synonymous with violence. Such a view is no doubt lopsided but it is also true that most of the recent acts of violence have been perpetrated by terrorists who swear by Islam. In the current context, the onus lies with the more sensible Muslims to work towards salvaging respect.

 Yours faithfully,

 Bhismalochan Sharma, Aurangabad

 Sir Dean Jones might apologize for his insensitive comment on Hashim Amla, but that can hardly undo the damage done. Besides, his comments are absolutely in keeping with his countrys record, right from the days of the white Australia policy to Australias involvement in Iraq and the obsequious pro-American policies followed by the countrys government. Joness apology also seems to suggest that he could have easily got away if only he had not been on air at that time. Does he seriously believe that people are so stupid as to be taken in by his half-hearted apologies?

 Yours faithfully,

 Biswapriya Purkayastha, Shillong 

 Sir The alleged comments by Dean Jones on Hashim Amla are an index of how strong still is the prejudice against certain races and communities in international cricket. It further harms the already tarnished reputation of Australia with regard to racial intolerance. Joness apology is only a knee-jerk reaction and seems more like a damage control exercise than an expression of genuine remorse. The international cricket community must take the sternest possible stand on the incident and stop Jones from doing commentary completely. Joness comment not only casts serious aspersions on the game but also robs it of the courtesy and civility that are often said to be its hallmarks.

 Yours faithfully,

 Arnab Sarkar, Calcutta

 Sir It is disgraceful that an experienced cricketer like Dean Jones should have made such a politically incorrect statement about Hashim Amla. Post 9/11, anyone with a beard is quickly linked to the al-Qaida chief, Osama bin Laden whether in seriousness or in jest even when he is not a Muslim. This indicates how skewed popular views have become and how people harbour deliberate misconceptions if only to put the blame off their own shoulders. Joness comment is especially unfortunate since he had been a player himself and should have known better than judging a fellow-cricketer on things other than his game.

 Yours faithfully,

 Ajmal Hussain, Sivasagar, Assam

 Sir If Hashim Amla has forgiven Dean Jones, then why is everyone else so hellbent on keeping the controversy alive?

 Yours faithfully,

 Indecent proposal

 Sir It is outrageous that officials of the Union home ministry blame the way women dress and conduct themselves for the crimes committed by men against women (Dress properly, home ministry tells women, Aug 12). Even if a woman wears provocative outfits or goes out unescorted late in the night, these still cannot be reason enough for a man to molest her. The question put by the minister of state for women and child welfare, Renuka Chowdhury, as to why men can move around with their shirt buttons open when women have to dress modestly, is extremely pertinent in this context. A lot of emphasis is always placed on the necessity of women sticking to traditional Indian attire, but there is no social pressure on men to wear dhotis instead of denims. It is because of this same attitude that men get away with almost anything while women have to be censured at every step. Demands for dress codes for women, discouraging them from going out unaccompanied, laying the blame on women for crimes committed against them, are all manifestations of a taliban-like mentality. What is particularly abhorrent is the fact that such noises are emanating from government officials, who are supposedly there to ensure the safety of citizens. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Amit Banerjee, Calcutta 

 Sir Can the officials of the home ministry ensure that if women change the way they dress and stop going out at night, then crimes against them will cease to happen? Even poor women, who cannot and do not dress like screen vamps, become victims of male lust and perversion when they go out to work. By pointing their fingers back at the victims, the officials cannot wish away the real reasons behind the rising graph of crimes against women. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir Ramachandra Guha, in his Protest in a new theatre (Aug 5), quotes Khushwant Singh misquoting the poet, Roger McGough. For the record, McGoughs verse reads, There are Fascists/ Pretending to be Humanitarians/ Like Cannibals on a Health Kick/ Eating only Vegetarians (not vegetables, as quoted).

 Yours faithfully,

 V.P. Singha, Calcutta

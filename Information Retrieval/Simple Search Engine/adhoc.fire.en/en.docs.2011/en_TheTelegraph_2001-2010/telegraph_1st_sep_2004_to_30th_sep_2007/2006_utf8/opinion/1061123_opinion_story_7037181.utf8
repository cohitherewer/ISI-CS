 THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM

 - Indians should take pride in the countrys pluralist equilibrium

 Independent India in its early years saw itself as a novel sort of nation-state. The three pillars of its newness were secularism, non-alignment and the mixed economy. All three positions were rooted in the experience of the Congresss struggle against colonial rule. Sixty years on, the collective verdict on the Republics early orientation has been harsh.

 Non-alignment was a way of tackling two Cold War blocs and it threw India in the company of such a mixed bag of countries that no coherent or novel foreign policy could have emerged from it. When you think of Indias principal allies in the non-aligned bloc, you think of doomed national projects: Nassers pan-Arabism, Titos experiment with one-party confederalism, Sukarnos authoritarian pluralism and Castros beleaguered experiment with socialism on a small island. The company of this bunch of dead-enders discredited non-alignment as a viable project. 

 Similarly, secularism began to seem like a feeble effort to do what the West had done for a couple of centuries, decouple religion from politics. It was commendable but it was part of the wardrobe of political hand-me-downs that we had bought in the intellectual thrift- shops of the Western world. Worse, secularism appeared to many well-meaning Indians to be a sort of pandering. To others, Indias secularism began to wear thin as the pogroms of 1984 and 1992 tore great rents in it.

 And as for the mixed economy, far from being a clever middle-path, it was seen in hindsight as a perverse curbing of Indian entrepreneurial instincts, a nightmarish licence raj. Indias economic emancipation, it is now argued, has come about because India stopped seeing itself as exceptional or unique and submitted itself to the universal discipline of the global market. 

 The truth is that secularism, non-alignment and the mixed economy, far from being Indias claim to being exceptional, obscured the real uniqueness of the young republic. And its uniqueness was this: in 1947, a desperately poor subcontinental polity born out of genocidal violence, freighted with more religious communities, language groups and cultural differences than any other part of the world, set off to be a democratic, pluralist nation-state. And heres the thing: sixty years later, India is still a democratic, pluralist nation-state. Sometimes marking time is epochal progress. 

 India today is the most important country in the world. To understand why, we need to look westward. Not very far west, just as far as Iraq. To excuse the failed occupation of that unfortunate country, Western adventurists have seized upon the presence of three communities, Shias, Sunnis and Kurds, as evidence of unnatural heterogeneity. A state odd enough to be home to such a variety of peoples is clearly an artificial state with arbitrary boundaries, doomed to disintegrate. 

 As pundit after Western pundit from the left, right and centre tells us why Iraq cant be a democracy or even a nation because its too poor or too fractious or too various, you suddenly realize that if India didnt exist, no one would have the imagination to invent it. And even if they did, they wouldnt have the inclination to because in the absence of India, the prejudices about the non-West that Anglo-American policy-makers and opinion-mongers peddle for a living, would pass for wisdom.

 But India is present, abundantly present: there are a billion of us and, in a collective way, well be sixty next August. For sixty years weve dealt with hunger, violence, pogroms, secession, terror, democratic change, communist chief ministers, fascist chief ministers, jingoism, wars, hot and cold, and were here, the greatest democratic project undertaken in the history of the world, still presentbut not accounted for. 

 Not accounted for because the cumulative weight of Indias achievement hasnt sunk in. If Indians do not recognize what India has wrought, why should we expect the West to make that reckoning?

 One reason for our inability to see Indias signficance is our habit of thinking of Indias institutions as derivative. We borrowed our parliament from Westminster, so the assumption is that the best we can be is decent imitators. Most of the time the world didnt even give us credit for that. I remember, a few years ago, The Economist memorably described India as a terrible advertisement for democracy. Even a sympathetic historian like Barrington Moore Jr., in his book on the social origins of democracy, called his chapter on India, The Price of Peaceful Change! 

 Whats forgotten in these descriptions is the way in which Indians improvised a pluralist nationalism that made it clear that no one community owned the nation, the ingenuity with which we invented schemes of affirmative action that in a world of ancient inequality acknowledged the need for justice, the slyness with which we avoided clientage through the long years of the Cold War. 

 Now were the elephant in the room when Western commentators invoke the Free World or reach once more for that mythical beast, the Judaeo-Christian past of democratic peoples. Its not merely that were free and not Western, democratic and conspicuously not Judaeo-Christian, though both these things are important in a world made claustrophobic by the self-congratulatory narcissism of the Anglo-American West. It is also that we are these things without being occupied by MacArthur, protected by CENTO or bailed out by the Marshall Plan. And whats more, weve taken the Wests largest claim to political liberalism, the separation of church and state, or secularism, and turned it into a many-petalled pluralist flower. 

 So when Holland, that bastion of tolerance and multiculturalism commits itself to banning the burqa because the practice of a hundred Muslim women subverts the foundations of Western democracy, when English politicians vie with each other to steal the white constituencies of the British National Party and when every leader in Europe from Romano Prodi to Sgolne Royal to Tony Blair feels free to publicly tell Europes Muslims that they need to behave, amid this hysteria, India stands out as a model of balance and sanity. 

 Despite a long history of communal riots and pogroms, despite secessionism, terrorist attacks on parliament and elsewhere, India still isnt in the business of banning burqas or ordering Sikhs to present themselves for haircuts. No one should underestimate the occasional cruelty of the Indian state or the discrimination many minority populations face in India, but equally, Indians should take great pride in the countrys pluralist equilibrium, its remarkable poise. So when we hear a complacent Western voice divide the world into the civilized West and the unwashed Rest, we should raise our trunk and swish our tail and having made our enormous presence felt, politely ask if he could say that again.

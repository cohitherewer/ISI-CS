 Undue favours

 Sir ? The governor of Andhra Pradesh, Sushil Kumar Shinde, has now become a Central minister, thanks to his close ties with Her Excellency (read Sonia Gandhi). Even after this, are we to believe that political appointments, especially that of governors, are impartial? The president of India needs to make sure that politicians do not become governors unless they give an undertaking to quit politics after serving their term. Only then would people give governors their due. Governorship, after all, is not a fertile ground for rehabilitation of politicians.

 Yours faithfully,

Biplab Chanda, Calcutta

 Return to terror

 Sir ? Hamas?s victory in the just-concluded parliamentary elections in the occupied territories is bad news for Palestine, west Asia, and the entire world. Mahmoud Abbas, who heads the Palestinian Authority, is a moderate. It will, however, be difficult for him to prevent Hamas from forming the new government because it has the numbers by its side. Such a step would undoubtedly lead to other problems. Already, the Hamas leader, Khaled Meshaal, has suggested that the organization would create a Palestinian army that would include its militant wing. This is bound to have serious consequences as Palestinian security officers, including those loyal to the Fatah, are determined not to give in to Hamas?s rule. There have already been reports of clashes between Hamas?s cadre and Fatah supporters, causing loss of life and property. If the two groups fail to work together, the resultant violence would weaken the country?s economic progress, which Palestine needs so badly. 

 More significantly, if Hamas were to form a government in Palestine, it is more likely to jeopardize the fledgling peace process in west Asia. Meshaal has indicated that Hamas would neither recognize Israel nor stop its attacks on Israel. Understandably, the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert, has made it clear that his country will not engage with a government that includes Hamas legislators, and has demanded that the organization should disarm and honour all Israeli-Palestinian agreements. 

 The Indian government had congratulated the Palestinian Authority for holding ?free and fair elections?. However, India needs to be careful about its overtures to the new government lest they spoil India?s defence ties with Israel.

 Yours faithfully,

Suman Barthakur, Guwahati

 Sir ? The Western world, especially the United States of America, need not have panicked over Hamas?s victory in the Palestinian elections. Diplomats in America, Britain and the European Union may be of the view that there is little reason to celebrate the democratization of the Middle East because of Hamas?s disrepute as a terrorist outfit. But the West must understand that once in power, Hamas would have to forego its violent ideology and follow certain rules and regulations that are acceptable to the world community. There is also no reason to suspect that the election verdict is likely to hamper the peace process in the Middle East. In a democracy, the majority is always declared the winner. The Palestinians have given their verdict through the elections and the West should learn to accept it.

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? The results of the Palestinian elections is likely to bring a big smile on the face of George W. Bush as it brightens the chances of another armed venture in west Asia. After all, wouldn?t the American president be happy to rid the world of another legitimate government in the name of its war against terror?

 Yours faithfully,

Ashok Sengupta, Calcutta

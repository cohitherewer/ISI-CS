The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 IN STASIS

 For Jharkhand, the celebrations have not stopped since its birth. Its politicians, providing for five changes of government in less than six years, have alone assured that the gaiety continues unbroken. Mr Madhu Koda, the new chief minister of the state, gave Jharkhand another such occasion when he took the oath of office in the presence of political luminaries from within the state and beyond. Like the resignation ceremony of his predecessor, Mr Arjun Munda, whose downfall Mr Koda executed with such lan, the swearing-in function may even be remembered for the remarkable civility shown towards political foes. But for Jharkhands politicians, such a show of decorum has never proved to be a permanent habit. As on every other time, the recent change was preceded by a display of low political cunning and ruthless machinations that left the nation horror-struck. Even before Mr Koda proves his majority in the House on the anointed date, battlelines have been drawn and gambits planned for mid-term polls. Mr Koda himself may not be entirely unaware of the minefield ahead. The third independent candidate to hold such high office in India, he has nine political parties to kowtow to and innumerable claimants to a ministerial berth. In spite of fulfilling his obligations and acting the pliant pointsman for the bigger players, there is little guarantee he will manage to stick on. Even the parties who support Mr Koda the Congress, the Rashtriya Janata Dal and the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha among them now see him as a stop-gap arrangement. His vengeful opponents can be expected to view him with even less kindness.

 However, it is not Mr Kodas political future that frightens. The developments in Jharkhand point to more worrying trends. For one, the complete unconcern for the states development. No government in office in Jharkhand has appeared to be particularly bothered by this issue. Which is perhaps why Jharkhand remains one of the poorest states in India and the among the worst-affected by Maoist violence. The battle for Jharkhand also showed with what earnestness political parties like the RJD and the Congress will fight proxy wars in other states. Add to that the dubious roles played by the speaker and the governor, and one has a chronicle ready to foretell the death of Indian democracy.

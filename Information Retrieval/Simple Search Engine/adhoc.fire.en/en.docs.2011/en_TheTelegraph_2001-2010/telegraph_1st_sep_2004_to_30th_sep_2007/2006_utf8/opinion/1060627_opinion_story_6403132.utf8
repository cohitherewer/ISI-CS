The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 STILL A RIOT

 There are many objections to the communal violence (preventions, control and rehabilitation of victims) bill, 2005. Human rights organizations, women?s groups, lawyers and judges concerned about sectarian violence are not quite happy with the long-awaited anti-riot bill because, they feel in different ways, it fails to add- ress, or even to perceive, the harsh realities behind sectarian conflict. One of its chief weaknesses, according to the critics, is the bestowal of greater powers on the state government, on whose decision would depend the intervention of the Centre. Since Gujarat is the nearest example of what has been evasively called ?communal violence?, and the role of the state in Gujarat discovered to be distinctly partisan, this feature of the bill has provoked outraged disappointment. So it is almost funny that the Bharatiya Janata Party has gone to the other extreme, opposing the bill because, by allowing the Centre a role in the control of violence, the bill seems to threaten the federal structure. 

 The BJP?s reaction would have been funny, if it had not been sinister. Mr Narendra Modi?s government in Gujarat has been repeatedly implicated in the investigations following the 2002 massacre. But to many he still remains a heroic figure, which is a chilling indicator of certain of the party?s attitudes. The BJP has merely drawn fresh attention towards its total lack of credibility on the sectarian question by opposing the new bill on a narrow and demonstrably absurd ground ? it is not more power that governments need but more accountability. A myopic opposition is damaging for the polity, for very important issues are at stake now. The bill at least makes a beginning, and its provisions for rehabilitation, though far from perfect, offer something concrete to build on. But there are numerous other questions. Communal violence suggests Hindu-Muslim conflict. Should a term, such as ?social? violence, be substituted? That would draw attention to the invisible violence towards sects such as Christians on the one hand, and also include all forms of group violence, such as caste, on the other. ?Violence? allows the state to ignore, if it wishes, discrimination or incitement. With a historic bill such as this one ? the objective of which is not to induce legalistic behaviour but attack irrational prejudices ? thoughtful, honest and thorough discussion is necessary. Not puerile pouts from the BJP.

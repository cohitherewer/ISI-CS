The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 TEST OF SKILL AND STAMINA

 Cricket lovers will hate to admit it but the football World Cup, beginning on June 9, is without doubt the largest sporting event on earth. In terms of popular enthusiasm, not even the Olympic Games quite rival it. Millions across the globe ? even in countries whose teams are not playing in the tournament ? will be glued to their television sets to see the matches. And tens of thousands more will be present in the various stadiums across Germany. Cities like Berlin, Munich and Frankfurt and smaller cities like Cologne and Hanover are all making special arrangements to cope with the floating population that will come in when matches are played. This tremendous show of interest is linked of course to the special status the World Cup occupies among players, referees, soccer administrators and football fans. The tournament began in 1930 and was then known as the World Cup or the Coupe du Monde. It was organized by Jules Rimet, the FIFA president. To honour Jules Rimet, the cup was named after him after World War II. 

 There are a few interesting sidelights to the history of this trophy. One is the fact that an Italian sports official smuggled it out from a bank in Rome and hid it under his bed to prevent the Nazis from confiscating the golden cup. The other concerns its theft minutes before the finals in London in 1966. A mongrel called Pickles sniffed it out from under a hedge in south London. The trophy continued to have a chequered career. Brazil, after winning it for the third time in 1970, earned the right to keep it permanently. The top of the cup disappeared while the Brazilian team was parading it around. The top was recovered from a spectator. But the cup was stolen again in 1983 from its display box in Rio de Janerio. It has never been seen since. After 1970, a new trophy called FIFA World Cup was made and no team is allowed to keep it permanently. This is the cup for which 32 teams will be competing for one month.

 No other game calls forth a test of stamina and skill in the way soccer does. A fast-paced game of football demands fitness and endurance. Football is also a contact sport, so top-class players have to ensure that they do not incur injury. But above everything else, the joy of football lies in the skills that are on display. There is a show of speed, dribbling and shooting in the forward line; in midfield the skills of distribution, and the quick conversion from defence to attack and vice versa are on display; the defenders excel in position play and tackling; and in extremis there are the diving, flying and anticipation skills of the goalkeeper. And away from the pitch is the coach who plans the strategy. The team that makes the best combination of all the above skills emerges the winner and normally provides the greatest delight to the spectators. The final whistle will be awaited with much eagerness on July 9.

 CAUGHT IN THE ACT

 Prying eyes

 Music, mathematics and chess are the three intellectual pursuits where human beings have performed major feats by the age of adolescence. The names of Mozart, Srinivas Ramanujan and Boris Spassky spring to mind. Literature, which is a slice of life, isn?t in the same league because it takes some living with and living by. Since very few adults go through life without thinking too much about it, they have nothing new to say. The idea that one can do so when young is almost paradoxical. So, when 19-year-old Kaavya Viswanathan walked into Little Brown with her manuscript, How Opal Mehta Got Kissed, Got Wild and Got a Life, you would expect the house editor to have checked out the language, style and subject matter, and above all, whether or not the first two were not lifted from somewhere else. He didn?t and the young author walked off with a cool $ 500,000 advance.

 Two questions arise. What are the editorial processes that examine a manuscript and is it possible for in-house editors to detect whether key sentences and passages have been lifted from earlier books? Second, what do we understand by intellectual property rights and whether taking passages from other books without permission tantamount to theft?

 It is the in-house editor who first examines the manuscript. Given the pressures of daily work, very few editors wade through the entire manuscript. They examine a few chapters and then pass on the typescript to the outside expert for a closer read. If the report is favourable, the editor makes a presentation to the marketing department, which may suggest some changes before the project goes through.

 Every editor knows that a young, first-time novelist is fortunate if one out of fifty sentences is truly his/her own. If ideas are borrowed, so are sentences and phrases that are weaved into the text. But it is impossible to check out the sources from where the passages have been lifted; and if they are identified, it is not because the source is traced but because there is a marked unevenness in writing styles. An experienced reader would be able to spot the inconsistencies and would call for a meeting with the author and put her through a rigorous cross-examination. Sadly, this doesn?t happen because of time constraints and the author gets away till an intrepid reader points out the stolen sections. 

 Copyright law is a sprawling mess but rules of thumb are fairly simple. First, titles, ideas and facts are not copyrighted; second, copyright only protects ?original works of scholarship that are fixed in a tangible form of expression? and lasts for an author?s lifetime plus fifty years; third, about 200-250 words in continuous prose (not poetry) can be used, provided permission and due acknowledgement are made. 

 Given this framework, Viswanathan violated the spirit and law of copyright on two counts. She used Megan McCafferty?s (the original author) language, whatever excuses of memory loss she may make now.

 Is lifting a common practice? Yes, it is. Keep petty intellectual larcenies aside but what is appalling is how many of our big boys, especially Indian Writers in English, have made their reputations on thin air. But keep that for another day.

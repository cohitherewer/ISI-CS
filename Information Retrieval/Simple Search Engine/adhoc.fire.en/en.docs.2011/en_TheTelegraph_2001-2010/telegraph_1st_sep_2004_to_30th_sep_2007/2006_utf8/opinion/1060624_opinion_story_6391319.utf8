 SIGNS OF THE TIMES

 Short and not always sweet ? that is a fair enough description of many words derived from Old English and ?time? is no exception. The word refuses to shed the association of the winged chariot hurrying near to pounce on the shivering back ? it is not just the word that is short, the sense of duration it conveys is too. The Oxford University Press has found that this word is the most used in everyday conversation, which is perhaps an indication of the driven lives of modern times. It may be a long way from the versatility of the Old English days, when ?scyrta? could conveniently evolve into both ?shirt? and ?skirt?. But ?time? is no less versatile, since it has, time and again, stood for past, present and future, allowing poets to confuse the unwary reader with nasty cracks about time present and time past being present in time future and other such breath-stopping verbal acro- batics.

 No word is without its secret load, and the load is acquired as much from its immediate context as from its history. ?Time?, in this new list of most-used words, seems somehow drawn of its colourful sap, since it is followed by ?person?. Nothing could be duller. Or, in a different age and circumstance, less complimentary. A butler announcing a ?person? in 19th century England is certainly not expressing respect. Today, though, the popularity of ?person? is premised more on political correctness than polite incorrectness. The age is up in arms against gender bias; to mention women in some contexts and men in others can turn out to be an earth-shattering faux pas. ?Person? is the safe bet: colourless, genderless, without anatomy or angst. To have ?person? follow ?time? is to deprive time of all its bitter-sweetness, to confine it to the notion of the 48-hour-day that the modern person is rushing after.

 So it is no wonder that ?heart?, ?life?, ?peace?, and ?play? do not figure prominently in the list ? ?peace? does not occur among the first 100 words. But what about the new senses of these words? Some of them should be popular even now. Heart attacks are commoner than ever before, irrespective of the different life-skills that people possess. There is always a tension in the state of play in everyone?s lives, and peaceniks nowadays merely cause trouble by disrupting international meetings. And how are other new-usage words faring? ?Issue?, for example, or ?chill?. Of course, the last is a verb with the solidity of a noun, so it may not make it to any list at all. But it is a pity that ?love? seems to have lost out to ?case? and ?point? ? and this is not tennis ? and ?woman?, in spite of her gallant struggles, to ?man? and ?child?. This last at least indicates that all attitudes have not changed. It would be a terrible pity if, in this season of the football World Cup, the native English speaker?s list of favourite nouns was to miss such eternal verities as ?beer?.

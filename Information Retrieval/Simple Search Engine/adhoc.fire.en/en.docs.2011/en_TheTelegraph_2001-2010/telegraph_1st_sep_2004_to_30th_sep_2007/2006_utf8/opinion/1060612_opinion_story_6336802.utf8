 FIGHTING FOR A CAUSE WITHOUT MUCH EFFECT

 Without reforming the panchayat system first, Nitish Kumar is unlikely to make a headway with his land reforms in Bihar, writes Sumanta Sen

 Noble intentions

 Reports emanating from Patna suggest that the chief minister, Nitish Kumar, is, among other things, seriously considering the introduction of land reforms in his state. The reports say that he is in the process of consulting experts for the purpose. If these reports are correct, and there is no reason why they should not be so, then the chief minister has realized fast that the best way to consolidate his support base among the rural masses is by ameliorating their economic condition in a way which would also instil in them a measure of self-respect.

 The Patna reports do not say whether Nitish Kumar has studied to any great extent the history of land reforms in neighbouring West Bengal. But even if he has not done so, he must have seen the repeated success of the Marxists and their allies in this state which would not have been possible without such reforms. Also, as a politician groomed in the socialist school, he can, at least theoretically, have no quarrel with the issue of re-distribution of agricultural land.

 And therein lies the rub. Socialists in Bihar and elsewhere talk of the need for change, but their actions imply that they are as much interested in maintaining the status quo as those they consider their class enemies. Nowhere in the world have socialists gone for any major change in the system. On the other hand, they have always sought to live with the system, adjusting it to their own advantage. The warts have somehow always escaped their attention.

 In India, this is particularly true of the followers of the Lohia brand of socialism. My stay in Bihar for a few years brought me in contact with a number of such men and, invariably, all political discussions with them led to the insistence that at the root of the problem lay Jawaharlal Nehru and the Congress. Nehru, of course, had passed away a long time ago, so to these socialists, the defeat of the Congress would mean the end of all suffering. The evils of the caste system that plague life in Bihar and north India in general, communalism, the grossly disproportionate distribution of wealth in the rural areas, all these things would be taken care of if the Congress were removed from the scene. Even Karpoori Thakur, a man who was widely respected in the state and who was definitely a cut above those who sought to don his mantle, was not wholly beyond this simplistic argument.

 Yet land reforms mean a mini upheaval in the countryside, with its impact felt in the urban areas, since in Bihar, a large number of urbanites have their roots in the villages. Land laws had also been enacted in Bihar but they could never really come into effect because of this nexus between the rural and urban elite. In West Bengal, the situation would have remained similar but for a strong leftist movement that slowly evolved from the pre-independence days ? the Tebhaga agitation can be mentioned in this connection.

 In Bihar, even the awareness for such a peasant agitation seems to be lacking. In his autobiography, Ashok Mitra has recalled how a progressive measure he had initiated when he was in the Central government had been opposed by the Communist Party of India under pressure from its Bihar unit. In Patna, I had a colleague who had every copy of a liberal Calcutta weekly in his possession but who, when it came to his landed property held illegally, would say, ?That land has been ours for generations. It is a gift of the Almighty, what has the government got to do with it (sarkar ka kya lena dena hai)?? The prevailing mood always has been that this status quo must not be disturbed ? a mood generally shared in the state and brought out quite effectively by Phaniswar Nath Renu in his novels.

 So how would Nitish Kumar introduce land reforms unless the backdrop is created in his state? The experts he may consult, or perhaps is consulting, will talk of ways within the legal framework, but what happens if that law continues to be ignored? Or what if the law is so framed that the rural rich get away with it?

 Here again, a look at West Bengal may be useful. When the land ceiling laws were originally made, fisheries and orchards had been kept outside their purview. So it was common in riverine 24-Parganas for landowners to allow salt waters to enter and submerge vast tracts of the paddy land they held in excess of the ceiling, and turn these into fisheries which yielded rich profit. Similarly, a few fruit trees could be planted to establish the claim that it was actually an orchard. 

 The powers that be in Calcutta knew exactly what was going on, but they never interfered because of the nexus already spoken about. The coming into power of a different dispensa- tion changed all that because the mandate it had received demanded such a change.

 The mandate that Nitish Kumar received does not make any such demands on him. Not that the poor in Bihar are happy, but because the political will for such a change is largely missing. The socialists, who have always been a major player in the state?s political scene, were always more interested in electoral gains through caste manipulations, and the CPI had come to be associated with the Bhumihars, the powerful landowners. Of the Congress the less said the better. Rahul Sankrityayan?s memoirs show how, when the Congress came into office before 1947 during the days of limited authority, it had openly sided with the sugarcane barons and the mill owners even while talking of British oppression. Today the socialists are a fragmented force but at the same time, they are also in office as they were when the Rashtriya Janata Dal was in power. But things did not change then, and the question is will they change now?

 This is wholly unlikely because there is, among other things, the caste factor. The Bhumihars who are now backing Nitish Kumar may well back out once their interest is affected. The Rajputs will have the coalition partner, Bharatiya Janata Party, taking up cudgels for them. And, most important of all, the affluent backward landlords from the Yadavs, the Kurmis, the Koeris will tear Nitish Kumar to pieces if he dares disrupt the apple cart. And all taken together, they will enjoy the support of the police and the administration whose bosses, to a large extent, also have their fingers in the land pie. In the ancient land of the Mauryas, any change of a basic nature is anathema to the influential.

 Meanwhile the state has held its panchayat elections. As usual, a number of lives have been lost and the state?s home secretary has pontificated, ?What do a few deaths matter when democracy at the grassroots is being introduced?? Incidentally, his name suggests that he was the same man who, as an election observer in West Bengal in 2001, had quite a lot of nasty things to say on the law and order front.

 What would these elections mean for Bihar? Again the answer has to be, very little. It is a partyless democracy out there in the countryside, the virtues of which are pretty vague. A party banner introduces a degree of accountability of responsibility. Take it away and it is free for all, particularly in states where the rural areas have always been the fiefdom of the local mafia. Delegation of power sounds nice, but power to whom? To people, whose allegiance to any ideology cannot be identified, and who in all likelihood will seek to perpetrate the traditional misrule of the sarpanch and the mukhia?

 If Nitish Kumar had been serious about land reforms, he would have first seen to the establishment of a politically well-defined panchayat system, which would have been the vehicle for such reforms. That is surely not going to be there in place when the chief minister does get down to his task.

 The Bihar chief minister?s intentions cannot be faulted. His problem is that he is a victim of a situation in whose creation his political mentors have played a large part. Today he has no other option but to go about in a way that appears to be placing the cart before the horse.

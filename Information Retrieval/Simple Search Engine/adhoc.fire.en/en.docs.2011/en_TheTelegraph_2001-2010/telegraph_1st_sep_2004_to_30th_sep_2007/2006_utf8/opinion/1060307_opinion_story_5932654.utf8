 SNIFFING IT OUT IN INDIA

 MALVIKA SINGH

 The celebrated Bush visit is over and children can go to their examination centres on time, citizens can move about their city without traffic stoppages leading to unimaginable snarls, the Manmohan Singh government can clap its hands in glee for having pulled off an Indo-US coup as many refer to it. I hope India will adhere to international safeguards and inspection for all the civilian facilities because the masterful ability in India of ?judao?, of sticking bits and pieces together in an attempt to plug a hole or leakage, is legendary and scary. 

 Dogs sniffing Gandhi Samadhi was truly sick-making. Far better Bush had remained away from our national sites than insult them. There is no need whatsoever for any visiting dignitary to go to Rajghat unless he is personally motivated and inspired to do so. If that be the case, such international leaders should have the strength and confidence to walk it alone, as Gandhi would have done, without the paraphernalia of ?protection? by gun-toting men, something the Mahatma abhorred.

 It spoke volumes about un gracious protocol and the limited mind of those who planned the ?events? for the president of a nation that has ruthlessly intervened militarily in nations across the world and over time since Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Gandhi became mahatma because he proved, through his actions and through satyagraha, that nonviolent protest is the slow but correct process of an assertion of beliefs. He believed in dialogue. He did not endorse carpet bombing, whatever the reason, nor did he believe in invasion or intervention with military support. The unipolar power has much to learn from Gandhi. The dogs were just symbolic of the lack of respect for the ideology of another. 

 Insane security

 Let?s hope that the US Congress passes the Bush proposal unanimously and India becomes a partner, not an ally because being an ally would mean sending troops out wherever the next invasion will be. And there may well be a different dispensation at the Centre by that time. Therefore, the ifs and buts, dotting of the Is and crossing of the Ts needs special, meticulous crafting, keeping India as the priority to prevent any back-tracking. A strong Saarc is critical for balanced geo-politics in this region. Sadly, south Asian countries are fiddling about with each other, allowing for other powers to enter and exploit all the weaknesses of that particular partnership. It?s time Manmohan Singh and his government made the strengthening of Saarc a top priority. Imagine if India could have a strong relationship with the US, the Middle East, South-east Asia, south Asia and Russia under her belt. The last four are natural allies and partners. India could well play the role of getting the US to comprehend that there are greater cultural and political entities out there, beyond their borders, that need to be brought into a consensus. 

 And the unifying cause is not ?We will fight terror? but ?We will alleviate abject poverty, discrimination and assaults on the diverse cultures of the world?. That is what the US has to be taught because we all know that till 9/11 the US had turned a blind eye to terror in our part of the world. We lived with killings and explosions but kept our pluralistic society together despite all the tensions, albeit with some unforgivable instances of communal brutality. That is what Gandhi had reinforced as he preached non-violent agitation against any ?wrongs? that entered the political and social space. US policy has been just the opposite. 

 Visionary leaders, political stalwarts with a clean conscience, should not need the trappings of insane security. At some moments in their political life they should have the guts to walk alone even if they feel threatened. To run scared does not bring respect. Do not go to Rajghat if you need security. Celebrate Gandhi.

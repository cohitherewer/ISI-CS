 THE NEW YEAR SPREAD

 Neha Sahay

 The Chinese New Year holidays have just ended. This is the time every year that expat homes in China begin filling up with Chinese delicacies. Sichuan spicy sausage, spicy beef, Hunan dried pork ? goodies which mark the Chinese New Year. The special quality about these delicacies is that they aren?t bought off a supermarket shelf, but are brought back from village homes by Chinese returning to cities after their annual family reunion. Be it poor ?migrant labour? or well-paid secretaries, few Chinese come back to their urban workplaces without loads of home-made goodies. 

 Trouble is, what do Indians do with this stuff? Most Indians, even if non-vegetarian, aren?t too comfortable eating pork, which in China is as ubiquitous as daal in India. The fear that everything is cooked in pork lard prevents many Indians from eating in traditional Chinese restaurants. One particularly fastidious Hyderabadi even wanted to request the owner of a small eatery to use vegetable oil for her party of Indians, but no one was game enough to make this request. As a result, the Hyderabadi ate practically nothing at an evening out with friends. 

 Not a dog?s life

 The Chinese authorities are so hung up on their ?market economy? that every event is evaluated in terms of its contribution to economic growth. The three week-long holidays that occur in a year are estimated in terms of how much money was spent, which province saw the most spending and so on. Indeed, that?s the very reason why these occasions, originally one or two-day affairs, have been turned into week-long holidays called ?golden weeks?. 

 The Chinese New Year or Spring Festival is easily the most extravagant holiday. Spending rises every year, much to the authorities? delight. But what takes the cake this time is this little gem in the People?s Daily about the current new year, the Year of the Dog: ?Nowadays, dogs in China make their contribution to pushing forward China?s economic development, which is the core task of China at this current stage. The number of dogs registered as pets has exceeded 400,000 in Beijing. Including those that have not been registered, the total number is thought to be over 1 million. Experts predicted that the annual sales of pet-related products in the country might exceed 6 million yuan in 2006.? 

 Cash please

 This New Year comes in the wake of an alarming number of violent confrontations between police and farmers over land compensation and official corruption, both certainly much more a part of China?s economic development than dogs. These incidents have not been discussed officially. But in an unmistakable message that such discontent is a matter of concern at the highest level, President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao chose to spend New Year?s Day far away from Beijing?s imperial surroundings, with peasant families, oil field workers, and survivors of Mao Zedong?s ?Long March?, examining their blankets and sharing dumplings with them. 

 Political observers point out that every year since Mao?s death, the ?supreme leaders? have chosen to send out such messages on New Year?s Day. Last year, President Hu spent the day with AIDS victims. It?s worth recalling that it was on New Year?s Day in 1921, that a small study circle with a certain Mao Zedong as its member, decided to pursue Bolshevism as a goal for China. 

 Seventy-year-old Mai dreads the New Year and the inevitable visit by the local government official bearing a quilt and a bag of rice. By now, her little home is crammed full with 10 quilts and 10 bags of rice. Cash please, is this poor Guangzhou resident?s New Year plea, echoed by others like her.

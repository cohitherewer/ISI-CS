 Murders most foul

 Sir ? The killing of a Communist Party of India (Marxist) activist in Lalgarh, West Midnapore by suspected Maoists, followed soon after by the killing of another in Bankura, should be a major cause for concern for the party (?Murder at Maoist kangaroo court?, March 6). And yet, we have the party state secretary, Anil Biswas, callously stating that the militants should have raided a big meeting if they had the guts. Is it not time to take a more pragmatic look at the root causes of the terrorist menace in Bengal?s districts? 

 The fringe areas of the left-ruled state have been denied attention from the government insofar as the basic requirements of food, shelter, education, healthcare and employment are concerned. Even if funds are granted for development, they fail to reach the target area and population for the corruption that is now part of the system. The government should rethink its policies towards these neglected areas, so that the people who have been joining terrorist organizations in the absence of a viable alternative, are benefited.

 Yours faithfully, 

Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The alleged Maoist killings in West Bengal and Chhattisgarh point to the alarming extent to which the Naxalites have solidified their base despite their suppression in the Seventies. The brutality of the attacks is shocking and no less bewildering are the strategies of ambush. The police are still in the dark about how they are getting the arms and ammunition necessary to carry out their plans. Such inefficiency will further lessen people?s confidence in the state.

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Maoists have been killing local CPI(M) workers with an alarming consistency. But party leaders at the state and district level continue to make tall claims about the suppression of the Maoist movement. Little can be achieved by trying to prove that the opponent parties are hand-in-glove with the Maoists. Two recently arrested Maoist women have confessed to poverty being the only reason why they joined the Maoists. The ruling party should shoulder the responsibility for the lack of choice. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sudarsan Nandi, Midnapore

 Sir ? At least 28 villagers were killed in a mine blast and around 120 people were abducted by Naxalites in Chhattisgarh when they were returning from a ?Salwa Judum? or People?s Movement against Naxalites rally (?Naxalites blow up truck with peace rallyists?, March 1). After every such incident the chief ministers of states and the Union home ministry chair ?high level? meetings to take stock of the situation and make impossible promises. The security personnel carry out routine combing operations with no results. But the comment of the chief minister of Chhattisgarh, Raman Singh, after the recent incident, perhaps takes the cake. He advised future rallyists to travel by foot only. What if the Naxalites use AK-47s instead of land mines to kill them? The response of the Central government after the terrorist strike on parliament stands in stark contrast to Singh?s. Stringent measures were taken to tighten the security around parliament even though not a single minister had been hurt in the attack. In a democracy every citizen, including members of the parliament, are supposed to be equal. But it appears that the law is different for civilians who can be easily finished off while people in power stay in safety.

 Yours faithfully,

 Motivated

 Sir ? U.C. Banerjee came up with exactly the kind of report that was expected of him when he was appointed by the railways minister, Lalu Prasad, to enquire into the Godhra train fire (?Godhra clean chit lacks legal force?, March 4). With such a rare ability to twist the truth for political gains, Banerjee is sure to win for himself nominations to head more committees in future. Committees and commissions are a waste of public money as no court is obliged to take them into account while deciding a case. They only seem to provide employment opportunities for retired judges. 

 Yours faithfully,

Chameli Pal, Batanagar

 Sir ? Ever since coach S-6 of the Sabarmati Express was set ablaze by a suspected Muslim mob, the so-called secularist political parties have been trying to pass it off as an accident. Lalu Prasad had his own reasons for backing the claim and that is why he appointed the U.C Banerjee committee to legalize it. Banerjee?s interim report came just a few weeks before the Bihar polls in February 2005, and now the final report has been declared when assembly elections have been announced in some states. In our country truth remains hostage to politics. 

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? The U.C. Banerjee committee was appointed in 2004 and has since done nothing to back up its conclusions. This time it has simply reiterated the findings of the interim report. This shows that such committees are merely weapons meant to serve political ends. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

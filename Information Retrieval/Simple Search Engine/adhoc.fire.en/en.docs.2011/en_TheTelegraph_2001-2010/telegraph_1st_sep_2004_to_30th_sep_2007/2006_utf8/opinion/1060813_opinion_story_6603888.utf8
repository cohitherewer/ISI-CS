The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 The functioning or the lack of it of the parliament has drawn grave concern from the president. In fact, at the dinner he hosted for the Tajikistan president, APJ Abdul Kalam even offered to help the Lok Sabha speaker, Somnath Chatterjee, in restoring the normal schedule of the house. Among the ministers and party leaders present at the dinner, Jaswant Singh happened to overhear the conversation. He went and narrated it to Atal Bihari Vajpayee, and this prompted the veteran BJP leader to ring Chatterjee and apologize on behalf of his party. But what an old warhorse proposes, the party disposes. And so, Vajpayees promise of BJPs cooperation was thrown right out of the window at the BJP parliamentary party meeting. Even this dismissal could have been swallowed, but the now-famous letter that was drafted accusing the speaker of partisan behaviour inside the house was in the name of none other than Vajpayee. No wonder Somnathda was so upset with what he thought was an unpardonable volte face. Could Kalam apply a bit of rocket science and think up a formula for the speaker?

 Meanwhile, most leaders in New Delhi are plain baffled with Natwar Singh. Why did he first threaten to tell all some even hoped he would name the mole that Jaswant Singh could/would not and then called the prime minister names and then, suddenly, turned round and saluted Manmohan Singh? Insiders believe that it was pressure from his home that prevented the country from having some more fun at the grumpy old mans expense. But Natwar might have been scared off by some examples a few of his well-wishers brought out for him. One was about a minister who had an ill-tempered wife. When the minister turned hostile, the establishment threatened to go to town with the written complaints of government officials who had been assaulted by his wife. Another rebel had all kinds of family scandals and feuds dug up. A number of Congress-baiters feel, though, that taking potshots at the PM is no good, Natwar should have exposed the Nehru-Gandhi family which is where his courage failed him. This disappointed lot has apparently re-christened Natwar from Nitwit Singh (as famously described by Khushwant Singh) to Natkhat Singh.

 Its been three long years. But on Friday, Ajit Jogi 

got up and stood erect for the first time since he suffered a near-fatal accident 

in Chattisgarh, which left him with multiple fractures and a broken spine. Jogi 

was overwhelmed and so was his doctor, Geeta Shroff, who exclaimed the moment 

Jogi left his wheelchair, Yes, weve done it. Bodily pain was only one among 

Jogis many agonies these last three years. First he was voted out of power. Next, 

his son got involved in a murder conspiracy. Jogi then had a heart attack. Perhaps 

being in politics for so long had something to do with it, but Jogi never lost 

hope. And the reward was a near medical miracle, thanks to stem cell research. 

And promoting it is Jogis new mission in life.

 If you thought undying faith in Marx and Engels had made the communists one of the more united political groups in the country, you may be quite wrong. Of course, one can always turn to West Bengal for proof. But now the infection seems to have spread to Delhi, where the reds of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha and they arent exactly a multitude cannot see eye to eye. The other day, while the chief CPI(M) whip, Roopchand Pal, and deputy leader Mohammed Salim were criticizing Natwar Singhs privilege motion in front of mediamen, the Rajya Sabha reds led by Sitaram Yechury and Brinda Karat were saying just the opposite. The discomfiture was quite apparent, and veteran comrades could scant hide their annoyance. Some were even heard saying: Era notun eshechhe, kichchhu jaane na. Era kono parliamentary norms jaane na. (These MPs [Messrs Karat and Yechury] are new to the house, they are ignorant, and dont have any idea of parliamentary norms.)

 The governments pro-reform lobby which includes 

pretty much most ministries, like finance, science and technology, food, civil 

supplies, tourism and IT are dead against throwing colas out of the Indian market. 

Their argument: the move will scare away foreign investors and MNCs. But their 

opponents argue that the MNCs need the Indian market more than the country needs 

them. Last heard, probe panel chief Sharad Pawar, who moves from cricket to cola 

with equal ease, had advocated a middle path. That is, dont budge till you have 

a foolproof case against the cola giants.

 Will the reclusive beauty from Bengal, Suchitra Sen, get the Dadasaheb Phalke this year? If the I amp;B minister, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, can line up a good array of soccer manoeuvres, she will. If pulling this off sounds difficult, then there is an even more arduous task ahead, were she to be named to get Bengals Greta Garbo out of her self-imposed exile and on to the stage to receive the award. Here too, Priyada is leaving no stone unturned. Sens actor-daughter, Moon Moon, and actor-granddaughters, Riya and Raima, have been sounded out and asked to take care of the gentle persuasion bit. Interestingly, Gulzar, who directed Sen in her most famous Hindi film, Aandhi, is also in contention. So is Sulochana, who isnt quite in the same league as the other two, but is known to have great lobby-power. Journos would any day vote for Sen, hoping that it will open up the much-wanted interview- and photo-op?

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Face the fact

 Sir The photograph of the tennis player, Sania Mirza (Search for Right Match, Sept 7), on the front page of The Telegraph, was baffling. It is difficult to understand the relevance of a picture showing Mirza on a shopping-spree in New York. Mirza had gone to New York not to shop but to play in the US Open. She fared poorly in the tournament and could not even make it to the third round. Then what is the reason for giving Mirza such a prominent place in Calcuttas leading daily? Can a pretty face be reason enough for this rare honour?

 Yours faithfully, 

Indira Ghosh, Siliguri

 Identity crisis

 Sir In The one and the many (Sept 11), S.L. Rao has dealt with the issue of identity. Raos analysis is significant because identity is a crucial component in a composite culture such as ours. Most of what Rao says in this context is true. But one can build on some of his arguments. 

 Rao points out that an individual possesses multiple identities during his lifetime. But human beings are bound to one another through the quality of humanness. Perhaps, if we all start thinking on these lines, we can overcome the problems that crop up as a result of differences. However, a person plays different roles in ones life. When he goes to a teacher, he is a student. When he visits a temple, he is a devotee. It is unfortunate that the laws of the land tend to identify citizens on the basis of certain specific markers like caste, religion or language. This despite the fact that every person plays many roles in the course of a single day. The trouble thus lies not only with peoples perceptions but also with lawmakers. A change in the peoples mindset and in the laws can help bridge differences between the social groups. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Dilip Bhattacharjee, Guwahati

 Sir S.L. Rao quotes Amartya Sen to argue that the replacement of multiple identities by a single one results in violence. And if that identity is based on religion, the possibility of violence increases further. The emphasis on religion by politicians has been responsible for communal outbreaks in India. It is necessary to emphasize a pan-Indian culture to secure the countrys secular fabric.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir For Muslims, their religious identity is more important than any other whether social, cultural or linguistic. This, Rao argues, results from their failure to appreciate the true tenets of Islam. 

 It is also true that the ghettoization of Muslims has resulted in their alienation. However, Muslims have themselves to blame for this. Educated and affluent Muslims hardly contribute anything towards improving the living or educational standards of their less fortunate brethren. This results in poor representation of Muslims in civil and educational institutions. Perhaps, only responsible leaders can help Muslims integrate themselves into mainstream society.

 Yours faithfully,

 No girls please

 Sir It is shocking to see a mother kill her new-born girl child (Girl child murder, Sept 3). Perhaps, the mother, Sonali Das, did not know that men and women are equal in all respects.

 Social stereotypes often make parents prefer a boy to a girl and women are often tortured for failing to conceive a girl child. If the authorities had been a little more vigilant, then such crimes would have stopped a long time ago. The Union and the state governments should share the blame for their failure in this context.

 Yours faithfully,

Moumita Nandi, Calcutta

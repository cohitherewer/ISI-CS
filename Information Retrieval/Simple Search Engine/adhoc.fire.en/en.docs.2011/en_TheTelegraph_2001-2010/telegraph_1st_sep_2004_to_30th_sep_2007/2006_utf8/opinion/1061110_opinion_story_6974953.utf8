 MISSION INCORRIGIBLE

 - Heaven help Britain and speakers of English

 Thomas Jones Barker, The Secret of Englands Greatness (Queen Victoria presenting a Bible), c. 1863

 A History of the English-Speaking Peoples since 1900 By Andrew Roberts

 Weidenfeld amp; Nicolson, 25

 Few bad books are so bad that they deserve review. Here is one: 736 ambitious pages of history from a modern British academic, yet seen through the spectacles of Rudyard Kipling and misted-up spectacles at that.

 It could have been a magnificent story: for all its faults, Britain and the nations born of its empire have had quite a tale to tell these past 106 years. Andrew Robertss pride in it is so great, his bias so extreme, as to make it almost ridiculous. We English-speakers this reviewer is one are the last, best hope of mankind. Really? Heaven help mankind.

 And why last exactly?

 Among Mr Robertss sources of pride, India is not one: he confines English-speaking to those countries where English is the dominant tongue. With a nod to the Afrikaners, though not much of one to the black majority, South Africa gets in. Ditto, thinly, the Caribbean. Ireland too gets its few pages, mainly hostile. India figures only as a place where the English-speakers played their mission (his word) out.

 Thats fair enough: the Americans, the British and their offshoots are indeed a clan, if a pretty divided one, to which India is, at best, a distant cousin, for all its acceptance of so many of their ideas. 

 Rather less fair is the writers bizarre notion of what their, i.e. Britains, mission in India was.

 Spreading the notions of democracy, free speech and yes, liberty, that ultimately brought the empire down, maybe? Most Indians, and rightly, would see a blacker side to that story. Still, lets live with it, as one that a modern Kipling might accept. Would even a Kipling of Kiplings time have accepted Mr Robertss astounding defence of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre? After no fewer than five vigorously one-sided pages on that wretched tale, he agrees with General Dyer: it restored order in the Punjab. Think, Mr Roberts urges us, how many more lives might otherwise have been lost (and throw in a snide reference to how many were at the Golden Temple 65 years later). If this is the last, best hope of Britains reputation in India, heaven help Britain.

 Happily, it isnt and wasnt: even at the time the London government refused to accept restoring imperial order as an excuse for deliberately butchering several hundred of the empires subjects. 

 Yet Mr Roberts is consistent with himself. Here in 2006 is a historian who thinks that the Mughal-like pantomime of the Delhi durbar of 1911 was the proudest day of Britains empire (oops, mission) in India. And he vigorously disagrees with those eg, supposedly, Macaulay, to name none later who thought that day would be the one when India attained self-rule.

 Rightly he excoriates the British, and Mountbatten in particular, for their mishandling, and its bloody consequences, of the last months of their withdrawal. Yet his real complaint, one feels, is that they were withdrawing at all: To take and hold a vast empire, he writes, might be a legitimate cause for pride; to return it for want of resources, morale, money and will-power let alone over political ideology should only be grounds for grief...To believe ceding power is better than exercising it is an infallible sign of national degeneracy.

 Silly Lord Macaulay! Degenerate Britons of 1947! They indeed lacked all those resources for hanging on; where or how Mr Roberts imagines they could have secured them must remain a mystery. But thank God, they had the mere political nous, as well as the ideology, to quit. Some of them even believed it was morally right, as the Americans had rudely suggested to their forebears nearly two centuries earlier.

 Do not think Britain and its Indian interlude alone are held up for admiration, or its occasionally silly lefties for sneering contempt, in this weird 19th-century parody of the 20th. Mr Roberts thinks as highly of the United States of America, and upholds, contra mundum, the merits of the Boer war, the Treaty of Versailles ending World War I, Pinochets coup in Chile, the Vietnam war, the invasion of Iraq and much else. Not to add the English-speakers invention of just about everything short of the wheel.

 Some of which is at least arguably true. A pity that astonishingly many of Mr Robertss facts are not, even if most (not all) of his errors are trivia. One could spend paragraphs listing them; but, for the record, just one. His supposed quotation from Macaulay arguing that Indian self-rule would be the proudest day in British history is not to be found where he sources it, in Macaulays famous 1835 minute on Indian education. Most of the quote is untraceable; the proudest day comes from a speech in Parliament two years earlier. Enough said.

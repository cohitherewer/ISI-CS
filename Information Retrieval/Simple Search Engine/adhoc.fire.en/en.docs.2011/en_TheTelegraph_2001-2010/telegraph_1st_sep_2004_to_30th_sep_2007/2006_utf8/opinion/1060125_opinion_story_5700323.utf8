 TO TRADE IN PLEASURE

SUBIR K. KOLE 

Now that the national elite and ruling class are campaigning 

for legalizing prostitution, it is time to rethink whether such a measure should 

be imposed merely on the whims of a few, without arriving at a national consensus. 

While the Planning Commission in its 11th five year plan document has recommended 

this, an sms poll by a leading national daily has revealed that 91 per cent and 

84 per cent respondents of Delhi and Mumbai respectively want prostitution to 

be legalized. Since the majority is for the motion, should we now condone pornography, 

strip clubs, live sex shows, and the buying and selling of women for sex? 

Powerful lobbies have been advocating the recognition 

of sex work as a legitimate industry. The International Labour Organization has 

also joined the bandwagon. In a controversial report, the ILO urged four poor 

Asian nations to take advantage of the booming sex industry by taxing prostitutes. 

The argument was based on the fact that the state should play the pimp by letting 

its women be sold as commodities in the national and international market, in 

return for a part of their earning as revenue. After successfully making HIV/AIDS 

eradication the primary agenda in developing countries, legalizing sex work has 

now become the next important target for NGOs.

The latest recommendation of the Planning Commission 

needs to be viewed within the power dynamics of state versus civil society 

whereby a group of futuristic, ill-informed bureaucrats are swindled by powerful 

NGOs through misinformation. More disturbing, repeated lobbying for prostitution 

by these NGOs has made it acceptable and even respectable as a profession. Anyone 

criticizing it has to bear with misnomers like the culture police or a sanghi.

Cruel act

Legalized prostitution is state-sponsored, one that 

legitimizes buying and selling of women as commodities for sexual pleasure. It 

segregates women as a class set aside for sexual servitude and reduces them to 

mere sexual objects. Evidence from Netherlands indicates that with legalization, 

there has been a tremendous increase in the number of brothels, sex bars, strip 

clubs, live sex shows and trafficking in women and children. The goal of any industry 

is to expand and if prostitution is legalized, how then can it be argued that 

this will regulate sex trade and prohibit the entry of minors? There will be hundreds 

of fake procedures to prove one?s age and an entire network of pimp-police-bureaucracy 

will benefit from the legalized sex industry. Criminals and exploiters of women 

who were earlier termed as pimps will become sexual entrepreneurs. 

The reason for not supporting the legalization of 

prostitution is that it is an oppressive, exploitative institution, which reinforces 

sexual violence against women thereby increasing gender inequality. What we are 

condoning here is women?s sexual slavery, exploitation and abuse. The failure 

to expand the economic and social opportunities for women in 60 years of planned 

development has now forced the Indian government to offer a choice to women by 

proposing to legalize prostitution. 

There is absolutely no evidence that legalization 

of prostitution reduces trafficking in women. There is also very little evidence 

that legalization brings down the spread of HIV/AIDS. Sweden and Venezuela have 

refused to give prostitution a legal status on the ground that the profession 

goes against the basic tenets of human dignity and social justice. But India is 

promoting it at the cost of the dignity of its womenfolk. If at all, the oldest 

profession in our civilization needs to be institutionalized, there should be 

a national debate on the subject. It cannot be imposed simply on the basis of 

the whims of a powerful NGO-bureaucrat lobby.

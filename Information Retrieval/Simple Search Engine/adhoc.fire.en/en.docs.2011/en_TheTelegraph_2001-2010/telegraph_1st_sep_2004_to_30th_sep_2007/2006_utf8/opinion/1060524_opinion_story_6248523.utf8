 LESSONS FROM THE HUSTINGS

 Bidyut Chakrabarty

 Democracy, if not marginalized, is certainly a casualty in West Bengal after the recently concluded assembly elections. The inference follows from the complete decimation of the opposition in the state. With 235 seats in the new assembly, the Left Front is far ahead of both the Trinamool Congress (29 seats) and the Congress (21 seats). It would, thus, not be wrong to suggest that the ruling party needs to discharge the role of a responsible opposition from within the government. To what extent is this possible? 

 The obvious outcome of such a situation is that the ruling dispensation tends to become autocratic. This is unwarranted. There is no denying that the opposition will raise its voice, but it is likely to be a very feeble one. Since ?the majority principle? governs legislative practices in a liberal democracy, the opposition can, at best, register its protest by recording ?a note of dissent?. The failure of the opposition to provide ?checks and balances? to the government will invariably weaken the ?democratic practices? that are usually followed in the legislature.

 The situation in West Bengal is peculiar. In Kerala, both the United Democratic Front and the Left Democratic Front take turns in power almost as in a game of musical chairs. Even at the national level, the replacement of the National Democratic Alliance by the United Progressive Alliance is indicative of a similar process. The presence of strong contending political groups with formidable support base will allow no ruling party or combine to indulge in grossly people-unfriendly practices. Given its unassailable numerical strength, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee-led government in Bengal will find it difficult to exercise that self-restraint. 

 Homework first

 The picture is thus grim. Is there a way out? One can think of two different ways in which the opposition parties can redefine their roles. First, these parties, despite being numerically weak inside the assembly, need to do their ?homework? seriously before they participate in the debates on government decisions. They need to abdicate their role as ?a shouting brigade?. By redefining its role as ?a responsible? unit of the legislature, the opposition will thus meaningfully intervene in ?legislative deliberations?. 

 The second way is through the opposition?s role as opinion maker outside the assembly. As seen in most liberal democratic countries, the opposition can stall atrocious legislations by mobilizing opinion against the ruling party or alliance. Apart from marshalling views of the people, the public debates in various fora will convey vibes which the government can hardly ignore except at its own peril. Given the shifting of loyalty of the city-dwellers to the Left Front in the latest polls, it would not be politically prudent to take the civil society for granted. 

 Other than garnering support for the views articulated by the opposition, the participation of the civil society in the governmental decision-making is significant in a situation where the coalition partners are important constituents of the government. In today?s era of competitive politics, no political party can afford to ignore public debates and especially those issues that catch the attention of the civil society. 

 True, Bhattacharjee has captured lost ground in urban areas riding on the dream of a liberalized economy. Now he has to sell this brand of economics to party hardliners. Add to this the opposition from the Marxist trade union, CITU. How will the Left Front, especially its leading partner, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), resolve this contradiction? The sooner it is addressed, the better for the ruling party and the state. Otherwise, the euphoria that was translated into positive votes for the Left Front will evaporate in no time.

 GET GOING

 Nothing emboldens a rebel group more than a governments lack of strategy to tackle it or even the appearance of it. If the United Liberation Front of Asom has grown bolder in recent months, there are clearly two basic reasons for this. One, the outfit wants to use violence in order to blackmail the government into resuming the stalled peace talks. Two, it seems to think that both New Delhi and Dispur are somewhat clueless about how to tackle the Ulfas terror. It is not uncommon for terror groups to use violence as a bargaining tool. But the Ulfa has come to increasingly depend on it ever since the talks between the Centre and the peoples consultative group broke down some months ago. Even while the talks were on, there were suspicions in different quarters that the rebels were using them in order to regroup and re-arm its cadre. This has now been proved to be true. None other than the new chief of the armys 4 Corps, Lieutenant General R.K. Chhabra, has confirmed that the Ulfa grew stronger during the temporary ceasefire. The proof also came in the series of blasts its cadre triggered all over Assam recently, the latest being the one at the Guwahati railway station. 

 What is more worrying, though, is the impression that the government lacks a realistic strategy to fight the insurgents. This can lead to a dangerous drift in Assam. The Centres ceasefire agreement with the other major militant group in Assam, the National Democratic Front of Bodoland, is due to expire later this week. The Ulfa and the NDFB are known to have worked in tandem, along with smaller outfits such as the Kamtapur Liberation Organization, which operates in north Bengal. All these outfits also receive logistical and other help from Islamic militants based in Bangladesh. It would, therefore, be extremely dangerous not to have a proper strategy to fight these elements. Yet the political establishment and the army seem to work often at cross purposes in dealing with the menace. And this despite the unified command comprising the police, the army and the paramilitary forces. True, the government needs to explore the options for reviving the peace initiative. The idea of involving the civil society in it, as the chief minister, Mr Tarun Gogoi suggests, may be useful. But, the administration cannot afford to be seen as weak and uncertain about responding to the challenge.

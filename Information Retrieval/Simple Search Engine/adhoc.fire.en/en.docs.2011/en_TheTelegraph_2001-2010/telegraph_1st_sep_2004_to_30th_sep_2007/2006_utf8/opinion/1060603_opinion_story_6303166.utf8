 A BLACK EYE FEELS GOOD

 What does one do when one is male, making corporate money, installed in a home full of lovely things, and a resident of the United States of America (with health insurance taken care of), yet struck by the banality of ones existence? One fights. And fights violently, voluntarily and in an organized way, with other victims of comfortable numbness. Fight clubs have been mushrooming all over the US and the Western world as a bizarre, underground version of gentlemens clubs, although there are female ones as well.

 Like most American phenomena, these clubs are inspired by a film and related computer games, which owe their existence, in turn, to a forgotten book. Fight Club, Chuck Palahnuiks 1996 novel, became a reasonably successful film in 1999, and gradually acquired a cult following among urban techies and other slaves with white collars across the country. In the novel, a nameless car-company employee turns insomniac out of anti-consumerist boredom (The things you own end up owning you), and is befriended by Tyler Durden a beach artist played by Brad Pitt in the film who makes a simple request to the narrator: I want you to hit me as hard as you can. The soul-transforming fight that follows attracts more such disenchanted men, and a secret support group is born. This is a fist-fighting freemasonry whose members call themselves space monkeys and see themselves as part of a movement called Project Mayhem that would eventually bring down modern civilization. Durdens men are the middle children of history, let down by their fathers, abandoned by god and adopted by Mammon, too late for the Great War or the Great Depression: Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we dont need. They naturally want to destroy the Louvre, and then clean themselves with the Mona Lisa after defecating. Indecorous references to the lower functions of the body are unavoidable while describing the mindset of the Middle Children, for they ultimately want to transform themselves into the all singing, all dancing crap of the world.

 Corporate America has now taken over this fictional apotheosis of what the rest of the world would call adolescent anger, fidgetiness and macho anxiety, and made out of it a therapeutic and cathartic antidote a sort of Boys Own Contra-McKinsey, which is then, by another turn of the enemy screw, corporatized and made part of the corporate culture itself. The clubs are full of consenting adults fighting on private property, but teens and even pre-teens are learning. DVDs of fatal accidents during fights are also available online. Palahnuiks original story has been altered in the process. His Project Mayhem wanted to destroy the consumerist world. But the real fight clubs offer a more packaged form of mayhem, as consumerism learns to contain the aggression that it generates. The fighting superhero chooses to return to work the next morning. A black eye is just another form of feel-good.

 FIGHTING IS A MAN?S JOB

 Abhijit Bhattacharyya

 On November 26, 1949, ?We the people of India? adopted, enacted and gave to ?ourselves this constitution?, which contained, amongst others, three unique fundamental rights ? Equality before law; Prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth; and Equality of opportunity in matters of public employment. Within six months, however, ?The Army bill?, having been passed by both houses of parliament, received the president?s assent and came into force on July 22, 1950 as ?The Army Act?.

 What did this act contain? Hold your breath and read Sections 11 and 12. First, Section 11, which says that no foreigner would be allowed to be a part of the armed forces, except for the Nepalis who are a part of the Gurkha regiment. Section 12 of the said act refers to the ?Ineligibility of females for enrolment or employment? in the regular army. This makes it evident that women were not wanted in the combat units of the Indian army. Only the support services or the ?attached? units were open for women.

 Significantly, the Indian Air Force Act, 1950 as well as the Navy Act of 1957 also rendered women ineligible for enrolment and employment. Clearly, Indian women have rather limited choices when it comes to the armed forces in the country. They are certainly not perceived as combat material in a war zone. For them, doors are open to ?support? the auxiliary units of the army and the airforce, but the Indian navy does not consider women fit to join its reserve forces. 

 No women please

 Given this situation, did S. Pattabhiraman, vice-chief of army staff, really deserve the scathing criticism for commenting that the ?armed forces can do without women?? He was definitely not far from the truth going by the laws that have been stipulated for the defence forces by the parliament itself. Does not the Army Act spell out that the army is not in favour of drafting women in clear, unambiguous terms? Therefore, the vice-chief should not have been criticized by those who adorn the high portals of parliament.

 Pattabhiraman?s comments may have snowballed into a major controversy, but it is a fact that no woman can join the combat units of the army without amending the law of the land first. And only the parliament is empowered to amend the laws.The attitude and the ideas of senior officers are unlikely to change till steps are taken to change the existing acts governing the army, the air force and the navy. It would be unwise to castigate generals as it is difficult for them to accept the fact that a woman can actually be allowed to be a part of India?s many combat regiments. 

 A woman officer?s suicide has prompted the defence minister of the country, Pranab Mukherjee, to examine the feasibility of inducting women into combat units. However, at least two retired generals have opposed it tooth and nail. A former army chief feels that women are not tuned to combat on the field. Moreover, they are not at a par with male officers either physically or psychologically. Also, the situations in which the army operates makes it impossible for women to enjoy any kind of privacy. Another major general is of the view that ?anyone who asks for women on the front is only diluting the efficacy and efficiency of the Indian army.? 

 These may be extreme views. But the opinions expressed by these individuals are not illogical or irrational. This is so because at the moment, the present laws are still not in favour of women joining combat units of the Indian army.

 The onus to change these laws lies with the Indian parliament and not the armed forces of the country. Till then, the army generals are not wrong in saying what they believe is true and cannot be faulted.

 OUT OF ISOLATION

 The spectre of Maoism is haunting parts of tribal India. The latest rebel offensive ? on a jail in Orissa ? makes two things clear. It reveals a strategy that is different from the rebels? earlier hit-and-run tactics. As was evident in the attack on a jail in Jehanabad last November, the rebels now involve large numbers of people in their offensives. The idea obviously is to make them look like battles in which the guerrilla army surprises institutions of the state. The other fact that emerges is that the Maoists have strategically located their bases in tribal pockets. The tribal heartland provides them with both cadre and operational bases. It is important to understand why the tribal communities are falling to the rebels? lure more than others. It is not as though other people do not have their complaints against inequalities. Although the Maoists would like to portray their rebellion in terms of the class struggle, the facts suggest otherwise. It looks more like the uprising of a section of people which has been alienated from the mainstream. The injustices and exploitation that tribal people suffer cannot be ignored. The lure of a violent ideology seems to be rooted primarily in their sense of alienation.

 The state has failed to assimilate these communities into the national or even the regional mainstream. This is not just a failure to distribute the state?s economic largesse. Unequal distribution of wealth is not confined to tribal areas. It is a much larger failure, because of which the state?s institutions and the democratic political system have remained largely out of these people?s reach. It is not just governments but also political parties and civil society that must share the blame. Only if this context of the rebellion is understood can an effective strategy to counter it be drawn up. True, the state has its constitutional obligation to uphold the rule of law. So the use of force is unavoidable. The decision to involve sections of tribal people in resisting the Maoists may help. But a holistic solution to the problem must put emphasis on fundamental issues. Governments, political parties and civil society together have to devise ways to break tribal India?s sense of isolation.

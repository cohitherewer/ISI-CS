 SHUFFLE THE PACK

 The parameters of an identity are elusive. They are certainly eluding the 30,000 voters in Nadia and Murshidabad who need to replace the voter identity cards they have lost. The Election Commission has fixed the price of a duplicate identity card at Rs 25, an amount they find hard to pay. Very low earners, often without the assurance of regular work, these voters simply cannot accommodate a duplicate voter identity card on their list of rather basic priorities. Their apathy in this matter has been put down to a mixture of poverty and ignorance: they do not realize that the voter identity card is more than just a passport to the polling booth, that it is needed to open savings accounts in a post office or bank, and to apply for Central government schemes. This authoritative diagnosis may be superficially accurate, but it displays either ignorance of a far deeper kind or a deliberate evasion of the realities of poverty. Hired farm hands unsure of their next day?s labour, women who have lost their homes through calamities or human cruelty, people struggling to feed their families and living always on the edge, cannot be expected to think of post office savings or Centrally-sponsored schemes. The quality of their lives gives them a radically different mindset from that expected by administrative officials.

 The impasse shows up a fundamental incongruity in India?s democracy. The price of the duplicate card has been fixed presumably with the expectation that all voters can pay it. And when they cannot, there is a determined effort to look away from the real issue of poverty, and the fact that there are thousands of people too poor to officially register themselves as citizens of the republic. The rules of the administration automatically disqualify them for this status. It is not something they have decided; the power to decide either way does not exist for them. When leaders of a democracy glorify the will of the people, perhaps they should start specifying which group of people they are talking about. It is up to others to decide whether the country is a democracy or something else.

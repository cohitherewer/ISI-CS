The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 A CRICKETER, NOT A GENTLEMAN

 SHOT IN THE DARK

 Sportsmen cannot be faulted for loving the good life. Most of us would not have it any differently

 Leave him alone

 Shane Warne is a man of prodigious talent. He now seems to be a master when it comes to wild threesomes. One of the two women described Warne as a ?stallion? in bed who is ?very willing to experiment?. Warne is equally good on the field ? he took seven wickets for 99 runs in a county fixture the morning after his romp. Not surprisingly, the leg-spinner?s conduct has set tongues wagging, especially in the media. But does the Australian cricketer deserve such slander for his conduct that night? His detractors seem to have conveniently forgotten that Warne has always been a champion cricketer, and never quite the gentleman. 

 There are some very good reasons to defend Shane Warne?s actions. Warne, apart from being a cricketer and a celebrity, is also an individual. And what an individual does in his personal life should not really be a matter of concern to others, as long as he acts in a manner accepted by the law. Warne, in this case, has broken no law. Unless you consider having sex in a plush London flat as an offence. Neither have the two women filed charges against the cricketer. Indeed, they have rated Warne highly for his abilities.

 Life as an international cricketer has all the trappings of celebrity ? money, glamour and women. Cricketers, being human beings, cannot really be faulted for loving the good life. Most of us would not have it any differently. It?s just that only a few of us actually admit to this.

 There have been quite a few colourful characters in the game ? Garfield Sobers, Vivian Richards, Ian Botham, and even our own Ravi Shastri have all made news, and not always for cricketing glories. So it?s not as if Warne is setting a precedent in this. 

 In fact, the media, which is doing almost all the moralizing, is not itself above the law. The Australian player got caught in the act only because, unknown to Warne, a couple of journalists from a British tabloid had been keeping an eye on him and his companions. This is clearly a case of the media infringing on an individual?s private life. And at a time when this kind of tasteless journalism is very much the order of the day, stories such as these should not really continue to surprise us. Neither should they be used as an occasion for pontification.

 And it is not as if Warne has not been made to suffer by his own demons. His much-publicized split with his wife Simone, and the public humiliation that followed, and the fact that he lost a chance to captain Australia because of his dalliances must have hurt. There is little to gain by tormenting a man who has chosen to be himself in spite of having gone through a lot. Most importantly, neither the media nor the society has a right to set standards of private behaviour for anybody. Warne may be a cricketer and a celebrity. But we should also accept him as someone with a few minor faults like the rest of us.

 NUANCES OF EMERGING INDIA

 Loss of the real?

 TOMORROWS INDIA: ANOTHER TRYST WITH DESTINY Edited by B.G. Verghese, Viking, Rs 595 

 Established in 1881 by the Cambridge Mission, St Stephens College of Delhi aligned itself with the nationalist movement of India from its early days. The bond deepened when C.F. Andrews, later known as Deenabandhu Andrews, came to join the college in 1904. The present volume contains articles by twenty-four alumni of this college. The authors have sent in their contributions by way of celebrating the 125th anniversary of their alma mater.

 The articles are wide-ranging, and, as the editor claims, purport to look randomly at emerging India. They seek to project various aspects of Indian federal democracy but sadly, in most cases, without the degree of historical objectivity or analytic acumen that their subjects demand. 

 Kapil Sibals Towards a knowledge society or Sitaram Yechurys Does ideology matter? read like typed versions of platitudinous political harangues with a mostly unsustainable ideological bias. The result is either nave optimism or misplaced sarcasm which miss the nuances of Indian reality by miles.

 Nevertheless, some articles are sharp and cogent. Dilip Simeons Rebellion to reconciliation, for instance, written in recollection of a traumatic personal experience of violence, insightfully describes democracy not as a social system but as an institutional arena wherein social conflicts are enacted in an unstable equilibrium. His plea for breaking through the structured violence of Indian polity, in some ways, reflects Jrgen Habermass discourse on ideal speech situation and John Rawlss theory of justice which created ripples in the debates on democracy in the early Seventies

 Another stimulating article is Sagarika Ghoses Indian media; a flawed yet robust public service, where the author efficiently captures the schizophrenic quality of Indian mass media. Her discussions of state control, the Bollywoodization of news items in the print media and the encroachment of privacy by the television carry unmistakable resonances of earlier reflections on the roles of media by political and social thinkers. The schizophrenic Indian media, as envisaged by Ghose, may be perceived as wavering ideologically between the over-deterministic Althusserian model of ideological state apparatus and the hyper-real, self-referential system of image-production which Jean Baudrillard highlights in Simulacra and simulations. Ghose, however, does not concern herself with the encoding and decoding patterns of these images which have been painstakingly examined by the recent scholars of media studies. 

 Arun Mairas call for starting a deeper dialogue across different belief-systems in his article is sincere and sensible, while Gopal Krishna Gandhis reassessment of the relevance of Gandhi as a questioning, teasing persona rather than as an ever-smiling, acquiescing icon in the Indian context is intense and poetically charged.

 Arun Kumar dwells on a triadic nexus of the Indian black economy while B.G. Verghese ponders on the management of the Indian diversity. Ravi Dayal stresses that the wealth of Indian English writing is as much part of the Indian culture as the vernacular or bhasa literature. But unfortunately, he does not go to the length of exploring the Indian writers use of English to encapsulate the Indian reality, as Amit Chaudhuri does in his article The construction of the Indian novel in English. On the whole, this new tryst with destiny is a worthwhile survey of the multifaceted Indian reality, but not quite its in-depth scrutiny.

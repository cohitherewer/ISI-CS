 Paperback Pickings

 When love and hate collide

ANANDAMATH (Orient Paperbacks, Rs 175) is arguably the most famous work by Bankim Chandra Chatterji, and this translation by Basanta Koomar Roy was first published in 1941, at a critical juncture in Indias freedom struggle. This edition has a preface by William J.Jackson and Mulk Raj Anands conversation with Tagore about the novel. An otherwise lyrical and lucid translation is marred by archaisms and usages that, since 1941, have become clichs. However, more attention should have been paid to the cover design, which, given the novels content and the present political scene in India, may seem distasteful.

BYE-BYE BLACKBIRD (Orient Paperbacks, Rs175) by Anita Desai studies the existential dilemmas of immigrants who face the future with their face still half-turned towards the past. The ambivalence of the characters toward their adopted homeland is reflected in their attitude towards the English landscape, which enchants and perplexes some but triggers melancholy in others. With the proliferation of the native-boys-abroad story nowadays, it should be remembered that this novel was originally published in 1985. Besides, readers may find Desais eye for delicacy and detail and her skills at characterization rewarding.

ALMANACK OF WORLD FOOTBALL 2007 (Headline, 12) by Guy Oliver is officially licensed by Fifa and is a compilation of global football statistics.It offers a minutely detailed record of every game played in the 2006 World Cup in Germany as well as a directory of Fifa associations. The past year in world football is thoroughly reviewed and ample space given to the innumerable domestic leagues, including Indias, and womens football. For the trivia-enthusiast, there are performance statistics for nations and individual players. However, the book is certainly not meant for detailed historical and analytical research on the worlds favourite sport.

 DICTIONARY OF SOUTH And SOUTH EAST ASIAN ART (Penguin, Rs 325) by Gwyneth Chaturachinda, Sunanda Krishnamurty and Pauline W.Tabtiang comes with over 1,300 entries and tries to answer the interested laymans queries not just on the regions art and architecture but also on its cultural history. Approaching the subject through terms and concepts, this book will be of use to both Easterners and Westerners.

 THAI LESSONS

 Mr Kamal Nath, in his speech at the India Economic Summit, complained about developed countries non-tariff barriers. He pointed out that whilst the United States of America let in raw leather duty-free, it charged 35 per cent duty on imports of manufactured leather. He gave an example of visa restrictions; software exports often required installation, repair and servicing at the clients location, which could not be ensured if the Indian exporters staff could not visit the client. He observed with a touch of irony that as India embraced globalization, industrial countries were shying away from India. 

 Mr Nath was right to complain about other countries protectionism; in particular, countries that preached to us the benefits of free trade might have greater impact if they practised what they preached. But the irony was not just in their protectionism; it was in the fact that Mr Nath had the nerve to complain about it. For his is about the most protectionist country in the world. Between 1995 and 2005, India imposed anti-dumping duties on 425 products the largest number for any country. It led both the US, which imposed 366 anti-dumping duties, and the European Union which imposed 327. India entertained the president of China recently in an effort to improve ties; but China has been the victim of the largest number 86 of Indias anti-dumping duties. India says in defence that China is not a market economy and that its prices contain hidden subsidies. But Indias worst victims are all market economies EU (36), Taiwan (32), Korea (30), Japan (20) and south-east Asian countries.

 When it comes to import duties, India is again one of the worlds worst offenders. While the rest of the world negotiated its duties downwards, India demurred. It could get away with it as long as its share of world trade was negligible. It did bring down duties after the reforms; but they still continue to be amongst the worlds highest. When Mr Nath asks industrial countries to bring down their non-tariff barriers, they point to Indias tariffs, especially agricultural ones. Mr Nath is fond of saying in reply that he is prepared to negotiate commerce but not subsistence. This argument is specious. India produces 132 million tons of rice over a fifth of world production and five times world exports. And yet it is afraid of Thailand, which exports 8 million tons out of its output of 25 million tons. It produces 20 million tons of sugar, and yet it cannot compete with Thailand, which exports half of its output of 5 million tons. Mr Nath no doubt often goes to Bangkok and is taken into its prosperous countryside. He should ask himself who serves its farmers better he, who keeps bleating about subsistence, or his Thai counterpart, who has made his little country an agricultural powerhouse. Trade is the path to prosperity even for subsistence farmers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Bandh no more

 Sir The bold call, Defy Bandh, on the front page of The Telegraph (Dec 20), is one of the most remarkable instances in recent times where the media has voiced the public opinion so clearly. Whether called by the ruling party of West Bengal or by the opposition, bandhs never cease to exasperate or cause despair among the common people. The Telegraphs valiant campaign against bandhs will no doubt inspire people to defy the condition imposed on them by politicians every time they call a bandh. The bandh-culture prevalent in West Bengal has made the state a laughing stock to the rest of the country. The statistics accompanying the report amply prove that Bengalis are now more interested in work than in enjoying the idleness that bandhs bring in their wake.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir The Telegraph-Mode opinion poll on bandhs was quite an eye-opener. With 66 per cent of the people saying that they are willing to work on bandh days, it is proved that people do not support the disruptions caused by bandhs. Thus bandhs can be of no relevance in a democracy when the masses do not support them. Henceforth politicians should devise better ways of putting forth their demands than calling bandhs that inconvenience people and jeopardize the economy of the country.

 Yours faithfully,

Anuradha Adhikary, Siliguri

 Sir Perhaps the incisive opinion poll conducted by The Telegraph was partly responsible for the Trinamool Congress leader, Mamata Banerjee, calling off the proposed 48-hour bandh on December 21 and 22. But one wonders why such a poll was conspicuously absent on the eve of the bandh called by the Centre of Indian Trade Unions on December 14. Is it because the bandh backed by the state government of West Bengal had the tacit approval of the newspaper? 

 Yours faithfully,

Gautam Mookerjee, Pune

 Sir The war-cry against bandhs, though commendable, shows the newspapers double standards. A protest on a similar scale was missing on the day of the Citu-sponsored strike. The highlight was more on how the IT sector worked, and was allowed to do so, in spite of the bandh. The chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, is projected as the modern icon of economic development and he, supposedly, leaves no stone unturned to keep life normal on a day of strike. But this stance of his seems to apply only when opposition parties call a strike. He looks pathetically subdued before the labour wing affiliated to his party. If Bhattacharjee is really interested in the unhindered progress of his state, he should come down heavily even on his party and its affiliates when they call a strike. 

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir Every dog has its day, so goes the adage. The common people have long been at the receiving end of strikes called by politicians to serve their own interests. Thanks to the media, people can now voice their opinion against such bandhs. There is no doubt that it was the overwhelming public disapproval against the proposed Trinamool bandh that pressured Mamata Banerjee to call it off. 

 Yours faithfully,

Tarakdas Majumdar, Calcutta 

 Sir It is difficult to believe that Mamata Banerjee put off the bandh for the sake of Christmas (Thank the lord, not the lady, Dec 21). It is more likely that she came to realize that the bandh would further lower her prestige in the mind of the people. Even her party colleagues and allies are now wary of supporting her stance since they know that between the mayhem at the Bidhan Sabha and her never-ending fast, Banerjee has taken too many false steps. Perhaps this truth had dawned on Banerjee as well in a rare moment of clarity. 

 Yours faithfully,

Nirupam Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir Whatever might have led Mamata Banerjee to postpone her bandh, the fact remains that she did call it off. By putting off the bandh, Mamata Banerjee has acted reasonably for once and her decision needs to be acknowledged as such. Since The Telegraph has come out so stridently against bandhs in recent times, readers expect the newspaper to give Banerjee the credit that is her due in this regard. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arin Basu, Berkeley, US

 Sir Going against the directives of the high court, bandhs take place repeatedly in West Bengal (Bandh illegal, HC says again, Dec 21). If the proposed Trinamool bandh was condemnable because, among other things, it flouted court orders, then the same accusation can be made against the Citu bandh. But who will ensure that leaders of the Citu are hauled to court for disregarding the orders? 

 Yours faithfully,

Arijit Das, Shibpur, Howrah

 Sir Mamata Banerjee owes sincere apologies to those whose hopes of having a grand vacation in the extended weekend occasioned by the strike were dashed by the postponement of the bandh. The Singur controversy is destined to go on for a while. Holidayers will probably have their chance in end-January, 2007.

 Yours faithfully,

Arun Bansal, Siliguri

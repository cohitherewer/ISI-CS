 Letters to Editor

 Things fall apart

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Requiem for a PM? (July 8), is an incisive analysis of the predicament in which the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, has landed himself, led by his desire to stick to power at any cost. Managing a coalition government is trickier than managing a government headed by a single party. In taking important decisions, the prime minister has perforce to consult the leaders of his own party and also that of the coalition partners who are more interested in protecting their own interests than in supporting good causes. It is strange that before putting on hold all divestment in the Tamil Nadu-based Neyveli Lignite Corporation under pressure from the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Singh did not obtain a clear mandate from the UPA. He just beat a hasty retreat, bringing disgrace on himself and damaging the prospect of economic reforms in India. 

 Singh?s image as an academic fallen among self-seeking politicians does not always work to his advantage. He is too mild-mannered to be able to juggle the UPA allies, with their diverging interests. Managing a political mayhem as India?s requires less of idealism and more of shrewdness. However, the blame for Singh?s loss of face should also go to those who tried to control the affairs of India by making a marionette of an honest and well-meaning man. 

 Yours faithfully,

P.K. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? The policies of the UPA have increasingly come to be governed by the agendas of its allies. This has resulted in the deterioration of the general condition of the country and frustrated the hopes of the masses. This is indeed unfortunate, as the Congress, the leading partner of the coalition boasts of such erudite men as Manmohan Singh and P. Chidambaram among its leaders. They should try their best to salvage the reputation of the party before the people lose their trust in it.

 Yours faithfully,

Purnendu Pattnaik, Kharagpur

 Sir ? If the prime minister offers to resign his post, it will only be seen as an attempt to escape the consequences of his actions, or, rather, inactions. When the minister of human resource development, Arjun Singh, tried to introduce reservations for the backward classes in medical institutions for boosting his party?s vote bank, the prime minister merely looked on. When young doctors were brutally manhandled by the police, he kept his mouth shut for over a month. When the health minister, Anbumani Ramadoss, crossed all limits of decency by interfering in the affairs of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and ordering the expulsion of its director, Manmohan Singh did not protest. Given such performance from him, it is only expected that the rag-tag coalition he heads at the Centre should soon disintegrate. 

 Yours faithfully,

Mohd. Azam, Hyderabad

 Sir ? The government at the Centre should have done its homework before announcing the withdrawal of the divestment in the NLC, especially since this is a coalition government composed of parties with diverse interests and ideologies. The move will prove to be a blot on the progressive image that the Congress stands for. The country?s anti-liberalization lobbies can protest the UPA government?s previous decision to sell 10 per cent stake in the NLC but cannot provide any clue as to where the money for the social sector will then come from. However, they can pressurize the DMK to oppose the UPA government?s decision and threaten to pull out from the coalition. If the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, is being condemned for buckling under pressure, then the DMK president, M. Karunanidhi, deserves equal, if not more, condemnation for his actions.

 Since the rebuff to the UPA government by the Delhi high court on the issue of P. Venugopal?s dismissal from the AIIMS came close on the heels of the divestment controversy, Manmohan Singh is finding himself cornered. Under attack from all quarters, without any guarantee of support from his own partymen, Singh now cuts a tragic figure. But conceding defeat even before the war will not earn him the sympathy of his countrymen. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Anything but the king

 Sir ? That a consumer court has ordered a television seller to repair a defective set he sold 13 years ago or serve a term in jail does not speak much of the effectiveness of our consumer-protection laws (?Jail term for faulty TV?, July 10). It has taken 13 long years to deliver the verdict and that too in a case involving a faulty television set. The Maharashtra State Consumer Commission?s order that had absolved the guilty, Kishore D. Patel, of the charges previously is no less disturbing. If the customers have to face so much harassment in getting a straightforward case settled, then it is not surprising that most are reluctant to even lodge a complaint.

 If the government is serious about helping consumers, then it should make it mandatory for all shopkeepers to carry the telephone number of the nearest consumer redressal forum on the reverse of the cash-memos. But it might be too much to expect that shop-owners, with powerful unions behind them, will respond positively to the directives of the forum. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 NO TO QUOTA

 The idea of reservations in educational institutions needs to be contested and rejected on principle. The prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, must accept that quotas run contrary to the vision of building a society that recognizes merit and knowledge. The Indian experience shows that the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes for whom quotas were provided in the Constitution have not been substantially helped by job reservations. There is nothing in the implementation of the recommendations of the Mandal Commission which provides grounds to modify the view that quotas do not help the building of a society based on merit. In fact, the entire experience suggests that the matter should be seriously reviewed. Nobody denies the reality that Indian society is inegalitarian and that large sections of the population do not have access to those instruments that are used to measure merit. One method that has been tried is affirmative action, which is different from numerical quotas. The principle of affirmative action lays down that all things remaining equal, a candidate from the backward sections of society will be given preference. This principle thus does not deny merit but in fact upholds it in favour of the backwards. All reports suggest that the government led by the minister for human resource development, Mr Arjun Singh, prefers quotas to affirmative action. The prime minister, in a move to sugar coat the pill, has suggested that quotas will be introduced in stages. In other words, Mr Manmohan Singh has sought a compromise. He has refused to reject the idea of quotas. He has tried to soften their impact.

 The prime minister is wise enough to know that compromises are inevitably bad political moves. They do not make short term electoral sense. He could have taken a lesson from the chief minister of West Bengal, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. The latter, in an obvious move to garner votes in Calcutta, refused to remove hawkers from the streets of the city. The results show that it got him nowhere as the left?s vote share in Calcutta saw no significant changes. Similarly, the prime minister will discover that a compromise formula on quotas will yield no electoral dividends. As the prime minister of the country and as a man who has succeeded because of his merit, Mr Singh must stand up for certain principles without fear or prejudice. He cannot afford to suffer from electoral myopia.

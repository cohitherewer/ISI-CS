 Passionate about mothers

 it?s 

 a mom! (Penguin, Rs 195) by Shefali Tsabary 

 is subtitled ?What you should know about the early years 

 of motherhood?, and is a book that Priyanka Gandhi Vadra 

 wished she had read before she first became a mother, according 

 to the back-cover blurb. Shefali lives in New York, and 

 ?working with children and families is her passion?. This 

 book is not for the unsentimental and the prosaic. Motherhood, 

 it would seem from Tsabary?s discussion, calls for copious 

 self-expression, frequently in verse, or in the latest American 

 supermom-in-touch-with-her-feelings jargon. The result would 

 be richly entertaining for those hard-headed (and hearted) 

 Indian mothers who gestate, lactate, and so on, and then 

 get on with their lives and occasionally with those of their 

 offspring without much time for the quiveringly nuanced 

 accounts of what Gandhi Vadra calls the ?intense emotional 

 journey? of motherhood. Those with the hardest of hearts 

 ? men as well as women ? would be most amused by Tsabary?s 

 chapter on how to deal with the loss of libido (and therefore 

 of a general interest in one?s husband) after childbirth: 

 ?Sure, they may tune out for some time, but there will be 

 a second or two when they will connect.?

 scarred: 

 experiments with violence in gujarat (Penguin, 

 Rs 295) by Dionne Bunsha asks if it really started 

 with the burning of a train, and goes on to assert the existence 

 of a much larger politics of violence, telling the story 

 of a disaster in Hindutva?s laboratory which etched 

 deep faults in Gujarat?s social landscape. Bunsha?s journalistic 

 and emotional vocabulary pours out perhaps a bit too ?easily?, 

 given the nature of the extremity that she is trying to 

 document. The transformation of the Gujarat pogrom into 

 ?good journalistic writing? within just a few years of the 

 event, in the absence of anything more substantial by way 

 of justice, is perhaps the truly shocking thing about this 

 book.

 these 

 hills called home (Zubaan/Penguin, Rs 195) 

 by Temsula Ao collects stories about how ordinary 

 people cope with violence against the backdrop of the Naga 

 people?s struggle for an independent Nagaland and their 

 continuing search for identity. ?The inheritors of such 

 a history have a tremendous responsibility to sift through 

 the collective experience and make sense of the impact left 

 by the struggle on their lives.?

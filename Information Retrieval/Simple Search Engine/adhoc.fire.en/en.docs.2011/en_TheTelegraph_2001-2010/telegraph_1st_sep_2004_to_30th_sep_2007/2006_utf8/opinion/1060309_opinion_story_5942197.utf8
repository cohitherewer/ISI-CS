 IN LOVE WITH A STRANGER

 Neha Sahay

 The sight of a foreigner is no longer surprising in urban China, though Indians are still stared at as some exotic species. A sight now getting common is that of a white man with a Chinese girl, arm-in-arm. The man is often much older. 

 It?s not always a case of gold-digging Chinese girls. Sometimes, young girls strike up conversations with foreigners of any age, hoping to learn English. A waitress can approach a customer, a software programmer can start talking to the foreigner seated next to her in a bus, a group of university students out shopping can stop a foreigner just to try out their English. Interestingly, it?s always men who are approached, even if women accompany them. What such initiatives can lead to is anyone?s guess. There are any number of foreigners past their prime, with children back home, looking for nubile Chinese girls. 

 Gold-diggers, of course, are aplenty. The funny thing is, they are encouraged by their families; at least one never hears of any opposition to marriages between Chinese girls and Westerners. More tempting than the luxuries afforded by marrying someone who earns in dollars, is the hope of settling down in the West. 

 Unequal alliance

 Ironically, many white men who marry Chinese are reluctant to go back home unless their company decides to send them back. Life back home is not the bed of roses it is here for a foreigner. 

 Even before Jackie Chan advised Chinese girls to marry foreigners as the best way of spreading Chinese language and culture, 63 per cent of respondents to an online survey favoured marrying foreigners. The phenomenon is already so common that the Shenzhen Daily even carried a feature on how to prevent friction in such marriages. The commonest area of friction is the hold of the family in China. Westerners find it tough to deal with frequent family reunions at every festival, not to mention the phenomenon of grandparents-in-law living in the same house as parents-in-law. 

 There?s another awkward fallout, but it binds the couple closer ? the sniggers of the expat community at a Westerner who?s married a Chinese. However liberal they may be, Westerners love making fun of the Chinese. It?s not uncommon for white kids to loudly ridicule Chinese people. Some Chinese wives of foreigners have found themselves being excluded from the lotus-eating expeditions that most expat wives busy themselves with. 

 White magic

 Another jarring note in the expat-Chinese relationship is the ease with which the white man finds fault with the country where things are so easy for him. There?s so much he can find fault with: the legacy of Mao, the lack of democracy, the hankering for status symbols that the West has long discarded. It?s presumed that Chinese society is still ?evolving?, that the comforts and concepts the West has taken for granted for generations, are still mind-boggling for the Chinese. 

 However, not all Chinese girls married to expats want to leave a comfortable life at home and settle down in alien climes. And there?s one situation in which being an expat wife in China is a nightmare: being married to a black. In a country where every cosmetic contains a whitening ingredient, it?s not surprising that friends and family warn girls who get involved with blacks not to let it get serious. The girls start worrying about what their children will look like ? something that Chinese girls marrying whites never think of. 

 Latest statistics show that in Beijing and Shanghai, the trendsetters for the rest of China, the number of Chinese girls marrying foreigners has come down, while more foreign girls are now marrying Chinese men. Life may just get easier for Chinese bachelors reeling under the unequal sex ratio.

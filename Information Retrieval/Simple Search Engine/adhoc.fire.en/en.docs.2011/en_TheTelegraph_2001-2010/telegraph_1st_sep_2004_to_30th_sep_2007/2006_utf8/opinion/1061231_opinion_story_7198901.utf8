 Letters to Editor

 Money for nothing 

 Sir My uncle passed away last week. We took his body to the Shiriti crematorium to perform the last rites. Everything went smoothly, till it was time to get the pindo. The attendant refused to give it to us a job for which he draws a monthly salary unless we paid him Rs 300. After much arguing, we were left with no option but to pay him Rs 150. Corrupt people, such as this man, take advantage of the bereaved, knowing that the grief-stricken people will eventually give in to their demands. This is nothing less than deplorable.

 Yours faithfully,

 Avishek Nandi, Calcutta

 Fast track 

 Sir The charismatic Lalu Prasad has played the management guru with elan yet again. Students of elite B-schools such as Harvard and the IIMs were enlightened by his words of wisdom. Critics may call him a buffoon, but Lalu Prasad has proved that management lessons are best learnt hands-on, rather than from textbooks. If he has managed to turn round the railways, it has not been with the help of Western-style managerial skills, but with a dash of desi wisdom.

 Yours faithfully,

Jayajit Dash, Dhenkanal, Orissa

 Sir It appears that the headline, You aint seen nothing yet, Lalu tells MBA students (Dec 28), was meant to show up the humour aspect of Lalu Prasads address to MBA students rather than his more serious visionary approach. It is a good thing that the railways minister is sharing his thoughts with the next generation. Public figures in our country prefer to put on a serious look, whether they take their jobs seriously or not, and suffer from a severe lack of humour. Most of them are devoid of a vision for the country, which they try to disguise under a feigned secretiveness. Lalu Prasad is refreshingly different. Not only is he unabashed about his rustic origins, he has made a brand out of his image. By whatever yardstick one measures the growth of Indian railways, there is no denying that the earthiest ideas from Lalu Prasads stable are yielding dividends. He must be thanked for giving a glimpse of his vision, and also his unique brand of humour, to budding managers from India and beyond.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir Lalu Prasad telling B-school students that asli cinema to baaki hai confirms that he has ambitious plans for the railways, which has already registered a Rs 13,000 crore profit in his first year at the helm. Once regarded as a non-profit-making institution, Indian railways is picking up speed, and the contribution of Lalu Prasad to the process is significant. 

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, Calcutta

 Travel travails 

 Sir I am a student of Pailan College near Joka and I use the Budge Budge route of Sealdah south section to reach my college.I often get late for college as there are very few trains in my route, and if one misses a train, he has to wait for about 40 minutes for the next one. Since I have three more years in this college, I would like to appeal to the railways ministry to introduce some more trains in this route.

 Yours faithfully,

Moumita Mazumder, Calcutta

 Sir While travelling from Ranchi to Malda and back recently, I found that there was no liquid soap in the containers provided for them in any of the four toilets of my high-end AC 3-tier coach. There were no attendants in the coaches during either of the journeys. The safety of the passengers was compromised, since no checking of luggage was to be seen. Railway policemen were also conspicuous by their absence.

 Yours faithfully,

Atreyee Chakravorti, Ranchi

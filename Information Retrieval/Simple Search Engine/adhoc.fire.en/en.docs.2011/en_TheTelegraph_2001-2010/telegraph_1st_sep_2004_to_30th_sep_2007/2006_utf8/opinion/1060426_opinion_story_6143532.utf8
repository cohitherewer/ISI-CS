 Extracts from the United Nations World Water Development Report 2, 2006

 In the past decade, water and its governance have featured prominently on the international political agenda ....International efforts to foster water institutional reform have included recommendations on good water management practice, and the setting of...targets for improved water service provision to the poor and for greater environmental sustainability via the Millenium Development Goals structure....Hopes and expectations are now vested in recent international water targets...to improve the water situation for billions of people....While various international fora have intensified their work towards improving the world?s water situation... the actual funding to the water sector in developing countries is diminishing, or stagnating at best. Funding from donors remains stagnant, and additional investments from multinational water companies to improve water governance and access to water are currently decreasing. There is very little evidence that governments in developing countries are strengthening their water budgets.

 ....Water governance is nested in the setting of overall national governance and is correspondingly influenced...by the national culture, and by events local to the country...and developments in the global economy. 

 Some of the trends of water governance include ...a response to...pressures from the international community and regional organizations...a widespread process of reform of water governance is now underway. Progress is patchy but generally slow, as evidenced by the limited achievements in the production of national...plans and the weak coverage of water ....In developing countries there are often significant and serious gaps between policy-making and its implementation, not least because of institutional resistance by public sector water organizations. 

 Progress is being made in water rights ? in recognizing their importance in dealing with social and economic problems, in recognizing the importance of local traditions and customs, in facilitating the management of local competition for water and in recognition of human rights to safe water. 

 Corruption is a major issue in the water sector... but the impact of it is not well quantified because of a lack of detailed information. It is one of the least addressed challenges in the sector and much remains to be done.

 Privatization of water services in developing countries has not been able to meet the high expectations on improved and extended water supply and sanitation services. Much of the privatization debate has had a biased focus on multinational water companies. Local and small-scale water companies are mushrooming in both urban and rural settings and their potential ...largely remains unexplored. There is thus a need to refocus privatization to more systematically explore how local water enterprises, including both water companies and civil society organizations, can contribute to improved water services. It is also high time to bring the government back in and re-emphasize its importance in raising and stimulating adequate investment funds, as well as its critical role in regulatory and other governance functions.

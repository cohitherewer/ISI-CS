 Professional hazards

 Sir ? What is the reason for amending the Immoral Traffic Prevention Act (?Brothel goers, beware!?, June 21)? The new changes seem to encourage sex-work while dissuading prospective clients. Is the act only to be used for trafficked women in sex work, or will it include gay, lesbian, transgendered and bisexual sex-workers too? Also, given the increasing unemployment in the country, another question comes to mind: does any sex worker or activist motivate or engage his or her own son, daughter, relatives or friends to adopt sex work as a viable profession?

 Yours faithfully,

 Snehansu Bhaduri, Hooghly

 Faith in ruin

 Sir ? The demolition of the Krishna Mandir at Wachhoowali Rang Mahal in Lahore is significant because the official who was instrumental in the act had earlier razed a Hindu temple in Vehari during his posting there (?Lahore temple demolished?, June 14). India has reason to think that this is a systematic attempt to erase all architectural evidence of Hinduism from Pakistan. The political parties of Pakistan which have condemned the act seem to have realized that this might adversely affect the ongoing peace talks with India as well as relations with the other neighbouring countries. After punishing the erring official, the Pakistan government should rebuild the temple keeping in mind the sentiments of the Hindus, both in Pakistan and elsewhere in the world.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhash C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? The outrageous act of the Evacuee Trust Property Board in selling the Krishna Temple of Lahore to a private person and allowing its demolition for the erection of a commercial complex, reveals the status of minorities, especially Hindus, in Pakistan. India should officially condemn the act and suspend peace talks with Pakistan till it rebuilds the temple. Hindus everywhere should rise against all forms of pseudo-secularism. If the United Progressive Alliance government were a little more firm, Hindus in countries like Malaysia and Pakistan would not have had to face such assaults to their faith. Hindu organizations across the world should call for a protest against the injustice to Hindus.

 Yours faithfully,

G. Vijayalakshmi, Chennai

 Sir ? The religious intolerance practised in Pakistan is more than evident in the demolition of the Hindu shrine in Lahore. Proclaiming to be secular ? as Pervez Musharraf did some time back ? is of no help; the secularism needs to be translated into action. The Lahore incident was enough to make Hindus in India feel that their brethren in Pakistan are not safe and secure. To change the opinion, Pakistan must ensure that such carelessness is avoided in future. 

 Yours faithfully,

Deepak Kumar Taunk, Calcutta

 Sir ? While Pakistanis are slowly proceeding towards ridding their country of all traces of Hindu culture and religion, the pro-Pakistan government in India is na?vely opening its borders to welcome people from across the border. This gesture might win the UPA a few minority sympathizers, but it will not change the mindset of those who live in a theological state. The fact that ordinary people were behind the destruction of the temple shows that it does not take terrorists and militants to uproot other cultures to preserve their own. Everyone everywhere has the freedom to practice his religion as long as it does not come in the way of anyone else?s faith. Whenever that freedom is in danger, the persecuted people have the right to protest. If necessary, respresentatives of the community should also consider appealing to the global forum. 

 Yours faithfully,

 U. Agrawal, New Delhi

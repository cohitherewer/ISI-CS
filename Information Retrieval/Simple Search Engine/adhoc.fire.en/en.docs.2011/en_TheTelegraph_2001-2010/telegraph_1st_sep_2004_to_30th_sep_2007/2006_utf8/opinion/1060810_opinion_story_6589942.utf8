 BARK AND THE BITE

 NEHA SAHAY

 Its in the Year of the Dog that China has embarked on its dog-killing spree after alarming outbreaks of rabies: half a lakh bludgeoned to death in one county alone, and thousands more on death row in another city.

 Meanwhile, expats here continue to remain, as always, blissfully in their own world. The dog galleries on expat internet forums are filling up fast; some need owners, others are there because the owners think theyre cute.

 A posting on one such forum from a dog named Princess Lillifee is a telling comment on the Chinese view of dogs. The Princess recounts her life story: picked up by a Chinese but abandoned on the street after an accident broke her leg, some kind stranger took her to a vet. Lying on one side for days because of her wound, she developed a skin infection that made her lose all her hair. Despite or because of all this, a kind German, who already had a dog at home, adopted her. Within two months, she had recovered, but more heartbreak lay in store: the German was going back home. She couldnt take Princess with her because the vaccinations and paperwork required would take too long. So, asked Princess, was there anyone out there who would adopt her?

 Who but foreigners would risk keeping a dog as a pet these days? The latest massacre of dogs involved snatching away pet dogs from their owners and killing them before their eyes. Some Chinese newspapers have described this remedy as extraordinarily crude, cold-blooded and lazy, asking why the dogs hadnt been vaccinated earlier.

 The drive involved Chinas favourite tactic, a relic from the days of the Cultural Revolution: getting people to spy on one another. This time, those who reported unauthorized pets in their neighbourhood were given a monetary reward. The high pet licence fees in some cities lead to a high number of unregistered dogs.

 Off with their heads

 Its not only in interior towns that the dog massacres have taken place a drive against stray dogs was launched in the international port of Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong, last year.

 It is not only foreigners who continue merrily keeping dogs as pets, while a large section of the local population supports the States drive to kill them. More and more wealthy Chinese are keeping dogs as pets. Dog shows, and entire sections in supermarkets devoted to products meant for dogs, are routine. Surprisingly, the vaccination rate is very low.

 Some rich Chinese have three or four dogs, huge Alsatians to guard their villas. These are, however, never allowed into the villas, but have a free rein of the courtyard, barking their heads off at every stranger, even the neighbour who passes by everyday. For some, dogs are as precious as children. One man divorced his wife of 33 years after she had his dog killed. They were moving into a new home and she didnt want the creature spoiling it.

 When SARS struck in 2003, the level of official secrecy about the strange new disease was so high that rumours that pet dogs could be a source of infection went unchallenged. Panicky dog-owners flung their suddenly sick dogs out of highrises, abandoned them on the streets where they were hunted down by dog-hunting groups that included children, or took them to vets to put them to sleep. Ironically, within a year, civet cats, traced as one of the most likely sources of infection, were back on gourmet tables.

 Whats at the heart of this schizophrenic attitude towards dogs? Could it be the traditional love of dog meat in China? Despite efforts by animal rights organizations, dog farms flourish in China, and every city has restaurants openly advertising dog and cat meat. Some even offer the freshest meat procured on the spot in front of you.

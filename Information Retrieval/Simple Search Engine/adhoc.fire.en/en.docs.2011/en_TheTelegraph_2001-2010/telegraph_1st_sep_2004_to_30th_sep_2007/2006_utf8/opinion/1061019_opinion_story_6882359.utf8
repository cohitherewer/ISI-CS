 THE UNACCOMMODATED GODDESS

 In spite of being the great mediator between the cosmic and the human worlds, Kali is a determining influence on social life, writes Somak Ghoshal

 Tradition and travesty

 On that part of the Keoratola mahashmashan known as the Mahisur Udyan, a huge dais generally reserved for cremating VIPs, someone informed me is being prepared for the imminent Kali puja. Amid a clutter of ropes, bamboos and the usual litter of stray dogs lounging around the premises aimlessly, a framework for a pandal stands towering. The modernized electric chulli is located on the other end of the crematorium, and the three remaining slots for man-made pyres lie empty. Nothing feels out of the ordinary, or even vaguely disturbing, except that this is the setting for the puja itself. To worship the goddess of darkness and destruction in her primal abode, the shmashan, and yet to soften the edges of the fearsome qualities associated with her worship is deeply ironical.

 Undoubtedly, the sight of the swarms of devotees, jostling with the funeral processions, to catch a glimpse of the shmashan-Kali every year, reveals something striking about the nature of devotion itself among the middle classes. 

 On the one hand, the inhibitions about death, pollution and impurity, all the taboos usually associated with the crematorium, are put aside, and replaced by either ardent piety or whatever other emotions constitute the festive spirit that encourage so much irrepressible merrymaking in Bengal. On the other hand, the beautification of the shmashan, in order to accommodate the brazen ferocity of Kali, signals the inevitable need of the bourgeoisie to soften most things hideous and horrifying.

 The genesis of the puja in Keoratola is dark, if not sinister and surreal. It is believed that more than 130 years ago, when the shmashan was full of keora trees, the locals were routinely terrorized by dacoits, and the ghosts and ghouls who shared the burning-ground between themselves. While the dakats seemed to have co-existed with the supernaturals uncomplainingly, their fellow human beings, oppressed by this unholy nexus, desperately sought some remedy. One day, so the story goes, a kapalik arrived with the idol of the goddess, made in iron, and started worshipping her. All this might seem rather fantastic, so far. But then, there is someone still alive to attest to the existence of this anonymous tantrik.

 He is the purohit, Tantrikacharya Ramranjan Thakur, who has been performing the puja at Keoratola for the past 60 years. In his mid-nineties, Ram Thakur, the name by which he is known to all, claims that his grandfather, Chandramohan Bhattacharya, had known the enigmatic kapalik, and had learnt the esoteric rites of worship through prolonged observation. When the kapalik vanished suddenly one day, taking away with him the iron-goddess, Chandramohan decided to continue the puja, which was eventually taken over by his son Kaliranjan, Ram Thakurs father. What had essentially begun as one mans personal vision, soon turned into a full-fledged public affair. From 1928, a committee started by a devotee, Bijoy Banerjee, started overseeing the puja. In the course of time, the puja attracted increasing public attention, primarily because the goddess was held by many to be immensely potent.

 This also happened to be one of the very few religious ceremonies which Harijans could not only participate in but also actively conduct. That inclusiveness too was disrupted by the intervention of local political parties and the mastaans. The combination of the spectral and the criminal that had bullied the residents of the area in the 19th century continues unabated, only made less interesting by the marked absence of the resident bhoots. Once the puja turned into a joint venture of this medley of hooligans, there were inevitable lapses in the observance of rituals. The ceremonies, supposed to end before sunrise, often continued till late in the morning. There was public outrage over the forcible acquisition of donations. On the final day of the puja in 2004, everything, including the image of the goddess, was reduced to cinders by some unexplained accident. Some even held this to be the manifestation of divine wrath and dissatisfaction. In order to appease the public, the local councillor, Mala Roy, took over the responsibility of the puja from that year.

 The public reaction to the fire was propelled more intensely by the fear of incurring divine wrath rather than any feeling of anger at the local miscreants. The impetus for social justice had to be found through the corresponding fear of divine justice, in order for it to become a real concern. This phenomenon reveals something profound about bourgeois responses to forms of oppression, both physical and metaphysical. In order to confront vandalism, the crudest form of oppression experienced in the most physical of circumstances had to be perceived as metaphysical oppression, felt here in terms of divine retribution. 

 The belief in Kalis destructive potentials still survives, quite vividly, among many. It was used, in the instance of the shmashan puja, as an excuse to act upon grievances which exist quite universally, and often independent of religious contexts. Kali, with her capacity for primal destruction, has become the catalyst for a sense of social justice.

 Iconographically, Kali depicts several forms of transgression especially, of social, emotional and sexual norms that are starkly at odds with middle class mores. In the scriptures, she is almost always associated with blood and death, and it is difficult to imagine two other elements more intensely associated with pollution in middle-class Hindu households. 

 The shmashanKali, even in the pantheon of horrific goddesses, is quite unique. A petite figurine, she stands on top of Shiva, her tongue conspicuously held inside her mouth. She has two hands, unlike the usual four, holding a chunk of flesh in one and a cup of karon, liquor, in the other. Her mouth being full of the raw flesh of the demons, she stands tight-lipped, without shame or remorse for stepping upon her husband. 

 However, Kali has been traditionally imagined, and interpreted, as an emblem of feminine shame, caught unawares in the course of her apocalyptic frenzy. With her tongue hanging out, she is the divine affirmation of the social disapproval that is directed towards un-feminine behaviour, which certainly includes disrespecting ones husband. The expression of lajja is not only taken to be chastisement, but also considered as a highly refining emotion characterized by self-restraint and deference, important for preserving social order. The shmashan-Kali, then, becomes a subversive parody of the abashed, and therefore tamed, Kali.

 Ramkrishna once had a vision of maya. He saw a beautiful woman, pregnant and about to give birth, emerging from the Ganges. She lay down on the bank and gave birth to a son, whom she lovingly caressed and suckled for a while. Before long this benign woman turned into a terrible hag, grasped the infant, crushed him in her mighty jaws, and went back into the river again. The doubleness captured in this vision of the nurturer as destroyer is, according to Ramkrishna, Mahamaya, who is also an incarnation of Kali. 

 Kali, as the goddess of death and perishable time (her name, kali, is etymologically related to time or kaal), is supposed to bring us closer to reality, remove the film of maya from our eyes. Kali is, indeed, the great mediator between the cosmic and the earthly worlds, yet a determining influence on social life despite her unaccomodated fearsomeness.

 BRING BACK THE LEGACY

 MALVIKA SINGH

 Can you imagine an Indian soccer team playing like the sides we have been privileged to watch on television during this World Cup? Our chaps would be chewed up for breakfast. Fitness regimes and disciplined coaching helped the teams qualify for and compete in the world?s biggest soccer tournament, but India, which houses nearly a quarter of the world?s population, has nothing to show for it. It is embarrassing, is it not? Why have a ministry for sports and youth affairs if we cannot compete internationally? It is a waste of time, energy and money and it would be better to leave this ministry in the hands of the private sector. This would surely professionalize both sports and youth affairs, introduce healthy competition and generate wealth. In the hands of politicians and babus, this ministry will continue to remain static and soon become inconsequential. With the Commonwealth Games at our doorstep, the time has come for a radical revamp of our mindset which does not give any importance to sports .

 With the Games taking place in the capital, it is a god given opportunity for Delhi to plan for a grand revival. Infrastructure can be installed, the municipalities can be corrected and given a fresh set of rules to follow, restoration of degraded and neglected spaces as well as historical monuments and areas can be accelerated, and this layered and ancient city can get a new lease of life. We have to see whether the money that will be raised for the regeneration of Dilli goes into the necessary development or into the greedy paws and pockets of the ?authority?. Hopefully the government will use this forthcoming event to its advantage and deliver an international metropolis. We have to keep our fingers crossed, hope and pray that the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and its allies do not prevent the rejuvenation of the capital by slogan mongering, organizing retrograde strikes and stalling the required up gradation.

 Past perfect

 Restore Connaught Place to the pillared arcade it was meant to be. Demolish all the muck that surrounds Lutyens? Delhi, the illegal structures that were permitted by an uninitiated municipality that was only interested in making money by allowing illegal additions. Anywhere else in the world, in any country, the government would have compelled its municipality to nurture, protect and enhance such an urban legacy. Here, in India, we are masters at destroying our heritage, ruthlessly killing the environment while our leaders and the bureaucracy look on and often indulge in the spoils of destruction.

 Shahjehanabad too must be swept clean of all the cross wires, the filth on the sidewalks, the maze of hoardings of all shapes and sizes that kill the facades of old buildings. In all the different ?cities? of Delhi, the government should allocate a small building or haveli where a museum of the history of that part of Dilli can be set up, along with an attached craft shop and a caf? serving local speciality fare. This will generate the money for the upkeep and maintenance of the museum. This is done across the world and these museums tell the story of the city. Delhi lacks all these simple pleasures because the government and the bureaucracy are all pervasive and know very little about the history and majesty of the city.

 For a start, there should be a museum dedicated to the buildings of New Delhi. It should be housed in one of the bungalows in Lutyens? Delhi. Original ground plans exist but ministers have carelessly added partitions and other horrors, destroying the grand mansions. Restore one perfectly, down to the minutest detail. Put in furniture that Lutyens designed. Hand down photographs of the building of Delhi and recreate the garden as per the original plan. Put a restaurant, a shop and office in the ?servants? wing?. Celebrate the city that Lutyens built.

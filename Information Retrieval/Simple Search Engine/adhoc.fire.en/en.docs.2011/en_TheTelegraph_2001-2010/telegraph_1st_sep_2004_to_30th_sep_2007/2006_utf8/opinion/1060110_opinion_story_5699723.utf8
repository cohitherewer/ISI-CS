 Whose development?

 Sir ? The death of 12 tribals in police firing at Kalinga Nagar in Jajpur district of Orissa is an eye-opener for all state governments (?Blood on development model?, Jan 3). While the Orissa government is showing amazing alacrity in giving the go-ahead to industrial projects to be set up in the state, the same promptness is sadly not reflected in its rehabilitation efforts. In their efforts to facilitate rapid industrialization, the state governments seem to be turning a blind eye towards the plight of the poor and the tribals who are being displaced from their lands without getting adequate compensation and rehabilitation benefits. Incidents like Kalinga Nagar can only become more frequent given the current state of affairs. 

 Yours faithfully,

Barun Kumar Mahapatro, Berhampur, Orissa

 Sir ? Tata Steel?s proposed steel plant in Jajpur witnessed a violent inauguration ceremony as twelve tribals were killed in police firing and a constable was killed in the subsequent agitation by the tribal people. The villagers had every right to protest against the establishment of the steel plant, as it took away their land and livelihood. The Orissa government granted permission to Tata Steel without engaging in any dialogue with the local inhabitants first. When they protested, the police arbitrarily opened fire. Without finalizing a rehabilitation and compensation package, the government should not have signed a memorandum of understanding with the investors. Jharkhand, which has recently signed a similar MoU, should take lessons from the incident at Kalinga Nagar. 

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? Industrialization is healthy for the economy, but not at the expense of tribal life and land. Adequate provision for rehabilitation must be ensured for the people whose plots are to be taken over for setting up industrial units. The government can only bask in the glory of industrialization if it takes care of the people who are rendered homeless in the process. Blind industrialization benefits neither the economy nor the people. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The killing of tribals in Orissa and its consequence have an important message for West Bengal too. The farmers who have lost their land to the Bengal government?s new-found love for industrialization no longer have any faith in the state?s rhetoric of poverty alleviation. In most of the cases, compensation is sanctioned but it fails to reach the displaced owing to avaricious officials and lack of coordination among government departments. The poor farmers are left with empty promises. The state government should make sure that the Orissa incident is not replicated in Bengal.

 Yours faithfully,

Sudarsan Nandi, Midnapore

 Sir ? The Orissa tragedy is one more proof that economic development is a zero-sum game ? where one person?s gain comes from another?s loss. But given the pace at which our economy is growing , it is difficult to find large stretches of uninhabited land to meet the industry?s demands. Therefore, new development projects, such as power plants, steel plants, information technology campuses and so on will have to be built on land which are already inhabited. The problem is that most often, the people who are expected to sacrifice their land, such as the tribals of Kalinga Nagar do not feel part of the development process. Similar reactions were noticed while people were displaced from the Narmada valley some years ago. Therefore, the social benefit-cost analysis ultimately shows that a few people have to pay for the economic development and prosperity of the larger sections of society. But it is not economically viable to grant large compensation packages for the displaced people. What is needed is the creation of a strong institutional mechanism which will place the inhabitants of the land as stakeholders in the upcoming project. Instead of paying paltry compensation and thereby fomenting dissatisfaction and social tension, the lands should be leased to the industrial projects so that the affected people are assured of a continued flow of income. This in turn would ensures sustainable development of the region.

 Yours faithfully,

Masood Md. Sohail, Calcutta

 Sir ? There is a clear indication in the killing of tribals in Orissa that something is seriously wrong with the way industrialization and development is being pursued in India today. The intensity of the tribal protest clearly shows that they are being robbed in a brutal manner. It is essential that any process of acquisition of land be done in a way that involves those whose land is to be acquired, and the compensation be such that the future of these families are more secure rather than uncertain. The cost that the industrialists or the government would have to incur for this must be included within the cost of the project. Otherwise, all of us who are consumers of steel, aluminium or electricity produced by dispossessing the poor will have blood on our hands.

 Yours faithfully,

Sunil M. Caleb, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is unfortunate that political parties are trying to fish in the troubled waters of Kalinga Nagar. It may not be out of place to mention here that recently in Tamil Nadu, after more than 40 people died in a stampede at a flood relief distribution camp, political parties tried to politicize the issue but failed when a judicial probe was ordered by the state government. Since the Orissa chief minister, Naveen Patnaik, has already ordered a judicial probe headed by a high court judge, the opposition parties have no room for crying hoarse against him.

 Yours faithfully,

R. Sekar, Angul, Orissa

 Sir ? The repeated atrocities on the weakest sections of society are the result of governmental indifference to building a consensus on development matters. It seems to be always the case that any understanding between the government and the industry adversely affects the lives of the poor. The Kalinga Nagar incident will be forgotten as soon as the dust settles down. But would somebody ask the local member of parliament what has been his role while trouble was brewing ? especially when the much-maligned local area development fund at his disposal would equal the entire tribal population?s average annual income?

 Yours faithfully,

Sushant, Calcutta

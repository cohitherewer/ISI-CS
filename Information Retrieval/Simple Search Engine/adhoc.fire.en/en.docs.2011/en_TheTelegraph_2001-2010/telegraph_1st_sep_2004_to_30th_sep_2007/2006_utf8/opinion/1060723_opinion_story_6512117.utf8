 FLIGHT TO KANDAHAR

 In an an extract from Jaswant Singhs just released book, the former foreign minister in the National Democratic Alliance government writes about his conflicting emotions and the tension of that flight to Kandahar to save the passengers of a hijacked Indian Airlines flight in December 1999. This is an extract from Singhs diary, written while he was on his way to Kandahar; he has deliberately let language errors remain

TAKE OFF: This helicopter belonged to the Late Ahmed Shah 

Masood. Jaswant Singh was flown in to Kabul in this helicopter to attend Hamid 

Karzais swearing-in ceremony on December 22, 2001

 December 31, 1999: 

 On board a special flight to Kandahar

 It is simply impossible to not jot down impressions on 

 board this special flight. I do not really know what to 

 term my mission mdash; a rescue mission; an appeasement 

 exercise; a flight to compromise or a flight to the future? 

 I do not know if this coincidence of it being the last 

 day of December of 1999, indeed of this century, and, as 

 has become a clich eacute; phrase, of the 2nd millennia, 

 adds irony to my journey or rings down the curtain on this 

 evil in our lives, ushering in a new, more benign and beautiful 

 beginning starting from tomorrow, the first of January 2000? 

 But such is my prayer and my hope, too. As for this journey itself, more as we proceed. But it certainly could not be any more dramatic and momentous; indeed as unique as this is. 

 On board with me are three TADA detenues, along, of course, with other staff ? engineering, security, aircraft maintenance for that hijacked aeroplane, plus spare crew, doctors for emergency and so on. 

 And by all that hangs this tale. 

 That day ? Christmas Eve ?the 24th of December, at around 5.20 pm I was informed that an Indian Airlines flight had been hijacked. There have been hijacks earlier but this instantly had entirely a different feel, even the announcement of it sounded more sinister. It somehow, at least to me, felt graver, of much deeper import. 

 How, therefore, the plane travelled the Indian skies and how Lahore denied permission the first time, the landing at Amritsar, the sudden take off after about 3/4 of an hour, the CCS (cabinet committee on security) meeting called urgently, denial of permission ? Lahore, a second time, a forced landing by the pilot on a darkened runway; my urgent calls to [Pakistani foreign minister Abdul] Sattar, the rushed take off from Lahore; the tension of landing permission being denied at Dubai, finally granted ? the landing ? parleys, some 27 or 29 women and children finally offloaded, the plane leaves again and Kandahar is the destination. By then it had become Saturday 25th, Christmas day and on this Christmas day at around 9.30 am, Afghanistan time, this aeroplane designated officially as IC 814, finally landed and parked, with 5 hijackers and a passenger manifest (including crew) of around 161 onboard. (This count, it later transpired, was wrong). 

 Then started a most demanding and emotionally a most draining period of my life. 

 On the 24th itself was born a daughter to Manvendra and Chitra (Manvendra is Jaswant Singhs son and the MP from Barmer, Rajasthan; Chitra is Singhs daughter-in-law). 

 She was born around 3.18 pm, the hijack occurred just about an hour or so later. 

 Also, in this very period, my poor dear mother, not well in any case, became even more poorly and had to receive yet another transfusion of blood, alone ? for I could not leave Delhi. 

 Starting on the night of this Friday 24th I went through torment. What is the right answer, where does it lie, how to reach it? 

 That is how these three terrorists became passengers on this aeroplane ? because all else is already so widely and extensively reported it scarcely merits reiteration. Besides being filled with utter revulsion at the prospect of reliving (in writing about) those minutes, hours, days, I am also very bone weary now. 

 For 3 terrorists, 161 men, women and children. Is it right? Wrong? A compromise? What? 

 Between two moral rights ? saving the lives of the innocents; and a fight against terrorism ? falls this hollow, unfilled space of the undetermined. 

 At first I stood against my compromise, then, slowly, as the days passed I began to change. 

 Thus this flight. I go to conclude, rather to have the hijacking terminated and take back the passengers safely. 

 And so to Kandahar. 

 Also tomorrow to 1 January, 2000/ 1.1.2000 

 For the hostages, their families and many others a joyous beginning, at least I hope and pray. 

 For me, 1999 will end on this note of humble and deep questioning.

 Now I turn to the next entry in my diary. 

 January 11, 2000: Aboard BA flight Delhi-London 

 Excessive fog has delayed all flights for the last so many days. Inconsequence this flight too, which ordinarily should have left for London early in the morning at 0030 hrs, took off, finally, almost 14 hours later ? at 1400. I am actually transiting through London ? for it is Rome to where I am headed, on a bilateral to Italy. 

 The last entry, in the last notebook, was also aboard an aircraft ? that which was taking me to Kandahar on a rescue mission. And that was 31st December 99. 

 Kandahar and the hijacked aircraft ? that bleak, abandoned sort of runway, the skeletons and that litter of derelict planes, Taliban ruffians lounging in a variety of poses on an assortment of vehicles. I am received by and then drive with Muttavakil their foreign minister and another somebody of enormous girth who, he announces is the minister of civil aviation. And there was a third in that new Toyota from the seats of which not even the plastic covers had been removed, he was a rather effeminate Afghan, shy of manner, who, he said intepreted. We drove along the runway and through the airport building ? more Taliban of various sizes, all lounging, all festooned with all kind of weaponry. And soon the airport complex roads gave way to a dirt track. That FM, Muttavakil, made some remarks about discomfort and I gave my rural origins reply, and thus to a concrete building of the standard South Asian CPWD ugliness, where on a table were spread out canned juices and some variety of cola, so unutterably sad, out of place biscuits and such other depressing condiments. 

 The author with former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee 

Some desultory talk, stilted, rehearsed and insincere. I mouthed appreciation and some (sincere) gratitude for what they had done, (well, they had actually goaded the negotiations on the hijackers at least up to a point). We agreed to meet the press jointly. It was getting dark. I was beginning to be nervously impatient. The whole system here at Kandahar is chaotic, on top of which the hijacked plane, the hostages, the relief aircraft and now the one on which I was ? I wanted the hostages to leave. And I wanted to meet all of them again ? after they had boarded the relief craft. So we ended this absurd ritual, I forced a termination of it. Then back to the tarmac, where hilariously, (under these circumstances, too) the civil aviation minister informed me that he drives slowly, mindful of my comfort. I urge him to shed his inhibitions! First, to the Boeing. Patent relief amongst the hostages, gratitude, profuse expression of it. Then the Airbus. Similar scenes. Then back to the building. A scramble by the assembled press ? largely Pakistani, some foreign. I make a brief statement; announce no questions. Back to the Airbus. In the meantime, even as I am with the press, and the dark is deepening, night descending, with a roar the Boeing, with all lights blazing, takes off for India ? on a runway with no lights. On the Airbus, farewells by Muttavakil and the civil aviation minister. A corps commander(!) also makes a brief farewell appearance. 

 Clapping inside the aircraft as we take off. Trauma appearing during flight. Some come and cry, some berate me ? abuse me, some in profound gratitude. 

 Loud clapping and jai jai kars as we land at Palam. It was just after 9.30 pm on 31 December 99. 

 I have jotted all this down, not having had a chance to do so any earlier, for I do not want to lose memory of this most trying and searing of experiences ? the first, and I pray my last encounter with a hijack. My memory is still fresh ? 11 days after ? for those impressions have been etched, as with acid, on my consciousness. It was a most troubled period this Christmas 99 to 31 December 99. By the time I reached home it was well past 10.30 pm. I had asked the MEA (Ministry of External Affairs) team to come home and share a glass of champagne. They left. We sat down to eat. Just then the telephone rang again. Now what? I thought. It was Vivek [Katju]: Sir, the hijacked aircraft cannot leave Kabul, not yet. What should I do? Where was any option? Dont let them take off? not before a full check, I urged. I sat down. The telephone rang again ? exasperated I said: Yes, what is it? Jaswant this is Strobe?(Talbott, then US deputy secretary of state). I want you to know how glad Brooke (Brooke Shearer, Talbotts wife) and I are? You did the right thing ? there was no other way. Congratulations. And a happy new year. It was midnight. AD 2000 had arrived. Thus, through trauma to resolution and tranquillity and hope ? I hope. 

 On 4 Jan I went to Jodhpur. Mother has been really poorly, bed ridden all the time, hardly eating, groaning with pain. I was guilt ridden, then also impatient with her, for she craved attention ? understandably but I lacked that?Bitter with myself and ridden with guilt.

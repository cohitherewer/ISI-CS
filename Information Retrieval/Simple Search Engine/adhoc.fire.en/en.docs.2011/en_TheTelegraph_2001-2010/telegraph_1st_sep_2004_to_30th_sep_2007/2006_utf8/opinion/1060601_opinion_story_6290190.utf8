The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 A VISIT TO MUZZAFFARPUR AND BEYOND 

 Amid the bustle of modernization, writes Anabel Loyd, ways must be found to channel India?s newfound riches to the least visible communities

 Dying art

 I took the train from Calcutta to Muzaffarpur in Bihar last week and shared a compartment with a family leaving their sports-bag export business in Calcutta to look after itself for a few weeks and returning to the home village for the school holidays. There were two teenage daughters and a baby girl of 16 months. During the journey the mother told us that the large gap between the older girls and the baby was due to constant attempts to conceive a son and to the regular abortion of female foetuses. Finally, at the last attempt, her husband had allowed her to keep another female.

 In the villages round Muzaffarpur, I questioned the women we met about sons and daughters. There, it seems, the poverty is so extreme that all children are a blessing and a curse, certainly there is little differentiation we could discover between male and female babies and the idea of dowry is a joke. Those villages seem as remote from Calcutta as from London. The idea of a visit to Bihar provokes the same reaction in the great centres of sophisticated society, industry and politics in India as it does in London. Generally it is seen as a basket case, anarchic, corrupt, with joke leadership from its politicians and its poverty beyond redemption. I was strongly advised not to go.

 I suppose one of the most extraordinary political conundrums is presented by the reincarnation of Lalu Prasad as the blue-eyed boy because of the newfound profitability for Indian railways after his appalling governance of Bihar. No doubt many readers could solve this riddle for me, but the state?s current ill-repute and the determination of the outside world to ignore it as a blot on the landscape of a growing and modernizing country is usually laid at his door. Bihar, we are told, has huge, if hidden riches. But Muzaffarpur is filthy, poor and ignored by the world and by aid agencies, which excuse their neglect on grounds of the corruption, violence and impossibility of regular reporting and evaluation of projects in areas where infrastructure is non-existent.

 Shops and markets are busy enough on the filthy streets, providing cheap cloth, cheap construction materials, and vital generators for those who can afford them. Electricity provision is eccentric to non-existent. The riches of the soil are on show; mangoes, lychees, bel, melons and vegetables galore, some unfamiliar to me. A cake shop has a window display of alarmingly dayglo cakes and confections, ships and dolls in crinolines, all melting slightly in the heat as the fans and air conditioners sit silent. Hot coffee and tea are unavailable; they can only be bought on the streets where no current is needed to heat traditional hot coals.

 M obile telephone shops thrive, of course, and computer shops with shiny plastic frontages, but email is a rare and logistically almost impossible luxury. In these days of instant communication, it barely occurs to a donor that a small NGO might not be able to keep in regular electronic contact or that communication of any sort is difficult and a cheap train ticket or a flight to Patna might be required to find out what is happening here. A cat?s cradle of cables hangs from every electricity pole, illegal hooking is habitual but, for all the good it does, people might as well avoid the risk ? there is little enough supply even for legal users.

 I had the privilege of meeting people in Muzaffarpur and in surrounding villages who are attempting, by mobilizing communities and building civil society with only token outside help, to change the lives of the future generations. These are the people who may one day turn Bihar back into the centre of social activism and political movements it has been in the past, at the same time rebuilding a shattered infrastructure and putting the state back on the map. Wishful thinking maybe, and unlikely to happen in any immediate time-frame but, when outsiders dismiss and forget Bihar, they forget that there are people surviving in such desperate circumstances who are trying to do something for themselves and need the spotlight of world opinion to light up their efforts and help them to grow.

 The remarkable efforts of P.P. Singh and the Mahila Development Centre are bearing fruit in more than one community in the Muzaffarpur area. Singh lives in the Gandhian tradition of an earlier generation. In 1952 his working life began in the Sarvodaya movement under the leadership of Jai Prakash Narayan. He later lived and worked with Naxalites arguing against violence and for peaceful means to gain land for the landless. In 1990 he began the MDC to focus on women?s empowerment, education and development and the rebuilding of society through them and their children. Role models for women there are aplenty in India ? Indira Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi, even Rabri Devi in Bihar was a leader of sorts and an illiterate woman. The MDC?s concern was first of all with women who are truly outcast and shackled by cast-iron prejudice and tradition. He began work in the red light district of Muzaffarpur, Chatturbujistan. The first meeting of women was on Gandhiji?s birth anniversary, October 2 ,1994.

 Suspicion of his motives in the Chatturbujistan community has grown into respect and acceptance. In outlying villages too, where the MDC runs self-help and micro-finance groups for women; branches of the Children?s Development Bank, where children can save one rupee at a time from their earnings from work in the fields, in the markets and as domestic servants. In Muzaffarpur, there are day and night centres for children where Hindi, maths, general knowledge and English are taught and vocational training given to their older brothers and sisters. All the workers in the projects are former sex-workers or girls who have escaped the inevitable means of livelihood in their community. The flowering of pride and self-respect and the passion with which these women work for small rewards is inspirational. Tragically, they still carry the shame of their backgrounds like badges on their souls when there is, as I discovered, much to be celebrated against so unpromising a backcloth. Even the name of the famous and ancient mosque in Chatturbujistan has become synonymous with a visit to a prostitute.

 W e were privileged to visit a house of traditional singers and dancers and to watch them perform. These women see the great arts of their tradition as the chains holding them to lives of no status beyond that of beggars. They are ashamed and do not wish to teach their children the music and dance that have been their lives since childhood. Their hope for the next generation is rather an escape through schooling and a job in a factory. The MDC has no wish to discard such cultural treasures but the cupboard is bare of both the funds and belief necessary to change lives while preserving the best part of ancient traditions. For myself, I found the singing, even while not understanding the words, drawing the same emotional response I have felt in a great concert hall or through the magic of grand opera. The dancing was both beautiful and sensual and the women humorous, witty and warm. How tragic in this day and age, when we have all learnt so highly to value our cultural history, that such art should be destroyed by poverty and social prejudice.

 I have visited grassroots community- building NGOs in India over a number of years and am now working with others to promote new alliances of these organizations to empower them and through them the people they work with. I have not often found an organization with so few places to turn for future help as the MDC, but I am sure there are other organizations in the poorest rural areas in the same predicament. In Calcutta, Bangalore, Chennai and Mumbai, there are large corporations, a working infrastructure and wealthy individuals, any or all of whom, if approached, may give in cash or kind to a worthwhile cause. In areas such as Muzaffarpur there are none of these, and foreign funding slips through the fingers of those who have not the means to pursue and propose to the major aid agencies. The MDC lost American funding after the nuclear tests. Remaining sources of funding, such as the department for international development, United Kingdom, as part of the poorest area civil society programme, focus on one or two specific projects and in no way cover the running costs of the centre, which exists in begged and borrowed rooms and dusty village spaces.

 I use the MDC only as an example of a community-based organization that may be more desperate than some but nevertheless continues somehow to build civil society at the level that ?trickle down? is unlikely ever to reach. There is a huge chasm between the middle classes, who benefit greatly and demonstrably from economic growth and the excitement of early boom days, and the truly poor in forgotten and ignored areas of the country. This can only be bridged by bottom-up approaches and greater awareness among more affluent society of the invisible poor, who exist in the least explored and most unhappy parts of the country. 

 For this particular organization there is one small gleam of light. The Consortium for Street Children, a UK based organization, has accepted a proposal for a study to be done by the children, with the children and for the children, facilitated by the adults of the MDC. This will highlight issues of health: HIV/AIDS testing is done by the government of Bihar but it refuses to publish results. Meanwhile children are already dying of the disease. It will highlight also child trafficking, police harassment and brutality, drugs, child labour, runaways and the lack of opportunity or hope for the future.

 T his study may help people outside more easily to understand the mountainous difficulties of life in such lost communities and encourage aid organizations, philanthropists and, most of all, the government, to look through a stronger microscope at the least visible citizens of the country and wonder how new riches can be channelled towards them too.

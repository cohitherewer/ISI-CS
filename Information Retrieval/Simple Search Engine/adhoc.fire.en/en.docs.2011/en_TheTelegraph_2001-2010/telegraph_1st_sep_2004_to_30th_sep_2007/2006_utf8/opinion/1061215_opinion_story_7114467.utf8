 Letters to Editor

 Lost times

 Sir The publishing industry in India has undergone a radical transformation over the last few years (Short note on a short essay, Dec 9). Publishers and booksellers today attach more importance to the authors names and their saleability in the market than to the real substance of their work. That is one of the reasons why none of the books being churned out in dozens everyday can match the literary quality of the works by R.K. Narayan or Mulk Raj Anand. Some of the Indian writers in English, such as Salman Rushdie, are producing commendable works but, as pointed out by Ramachandra Guha, the talk has been much more about the death threats issued against him or about the women he dates and divorces than about his work. 

 Early Indian authors in English like Narayan lived a simple life far from the media glare. And they wrote unpretentious stories that mirrored their own lives. One rues the disappearance of this class of writers. At the same time, it is heartening that contemporary writers like Jhumpa Lahiri are going back to the old style and so reviving interest in authors like Narayan.

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad 

 Sir Ramachandra Guha seems to be unfairly biased against Salman Rushdie. What makes him think that Rushdie would not be remembered forty years hereafter? Rushdies talent is quite different from that of R.K. Narayan, but that should not cause him to be judged an inferior writer. Writers reflect the world in which they live, and Narayans milieu is drastically different from that of Rushdie. If it is difficult for Rushdie to write Narayans kind of prose, then it would have been as impossible for Narayan to write in Rushdies style. And will someone please explain why it is impossible to read Rushdie between babies?

 Yours faithfully,

Ronen Datta, Calcutta

 Sir Thanks are due to Ramachandra Guha for reminding readers that 2006 is the centenary year of R.K. Narayan. Apart from this fact, Guhas contentions in the rest of his article seem quite pointless. He begins and ends with a comparison between Narayan and Salman Rushdie that says little besides the fact that Guha and his wife have different tastes in literature. The rest of the article is mostly a rehash of Jhumpa Lahiris essay on Narayan. What original criticism Guha ventures to produce is less about Narayan and more about Lahiri. And he amuses the readers by trying to fix the actual location of the imaginary Malgudi of Narayans tales. 

 It is amazing how Guha brings together three of the greatest writers of Indo-Anglian fiction without providing a single insightful comment on the works of any of them. Perhaps it would have helped if Guha had read more of their works. He confesses having read only Lahiris short stories and not her novel. As for Rushdie, only Midnights Children gets a proper mention and his other works get dismissed summarily as not as celebrated or as good. Guha does not discuss even Narayans works and, ironically, refers only to Guide, whose cinematic rendition was much lamented by Narayan himself. 

 Yours faithfully,

 For the people

 Sir Congress activists celebrating the birthday of their party leader, Sonia Gandhi, by rubbing cake all over their faces make a remarkable spectacle indeed (Madam, what a birthday bite!, Dec 10). Sonia Gandhi is supposedly concerned about starvation deaths, farmers suicides and poverty in the country. And then, on her birthday, readers are treated to the obscene show of her obese supporters devouring cakes. Perhaps this is not quite the way to observe Sonia Gandhis birthday. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Sir The trend in recent times is to celebrate the birthdays of political leaders in the most ostentatious way. The absurdity of these events lies in the fact that, in most cases, the subjects of the celebration themselves rarely take part in the festivities. The frivolity on the faces of the two men suggests that they are more interested in the feast than in the occasion. 

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir Sonia Gandhi is 60 years old. One expects that she would now be in a better position to understand the problems of advancing age. She might persuade the finance minister to lower the age for the entitlement to senior citizenship from the present 65 to 60 as a way to mark her 60th birthday. 

 Yours faithfully,

Mahesh Kumar, New Delhi

 Women on top

 Sir Women are finally proving that they can equal their male colleagues in every sphere of life (Women of power give men a shock, Dec 6). The men of Uttaranchal have reasons to feel threatened by the women who have taken over the duty of reading electricity meters, preparing bills and delivering them. And with these women winning over the approval of the Uttaranchal Power Corporation, quite a few men can be assured of losing their jobs. It should be remembered that the work that the women are performing so deftly is quite hazardous, since it involves climbing atop high electricity poles. At the same time, this is not an isolated example of women power in India. More and more women are taking up jobs in sectors traditionally designated as mens. Not stopping at this, they are often beating their male counterparts effortlessly.

 Yours faithfully,

Papiya Roy, Calcutta

 A matter of shame

 Sir Indian businessmen abroad should be ashamed of themselves for disgracing their country in the comity of nations (India in bribery big league, Oct 5). They seem more keen on exporting corruption than expanding their business. Probably, all that they have in mind is quick money at the cost of Indias reputation. It is hard to believe that some industrialists are not ready to accept the fact that they are responsible for Indias scoring so poorly in the 2006 Bribe Payers Index. That firms from wealthier countries also indulge in shady deals does not absolve our businessmen from their wrongdoings. The Indian governments crusade against this evil has remained confined within the nations frontiers. It should be more far-reaching in its impact.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir It is unfortunate that India has ranked so high in the Transparency Internationals survey of the worst bribe payers of the world. However, the better ranks accorded to European nations can be explained differently. The table of bribe payers has to be co-related to one aspect of globalization the inherent advantage the West still has over others. The ranking of countries like Switzerland has to be studied in the light of the fact that the West still enjoys almost a colonial grip on the world market, and, therefore, does not have to be very assertive or take recourse to illegal measures to ensure smooth trade. Thus it takes extra effort for developing countries to break into it. Countries like India, China, Russia and Brazil, now with better infrastructure, are in a position to exploit global markets. But those controlling it constantly obstruct them. Therefore, to displace countries like the United Kingdom, France, Sweden and so on from areas in which India and China can compete, requires tactics that can be termed corrupt. Besides, there cannot be a bribe payer without a bribe taker first. Why did Transparency International not come up with a bribe takers index?

 Yours faithfully,

Madhav Raj, New Delhi

 Hunger pangs

 Sir The editorial, Dangerous precedent(Oct 7), correctly points out that the resurrection of the garibi hatao slogan is a retrograde step, which might erode Indias gains from economic liberalization. With elections due as early as next year in several states, the United Progressive Alliance, especially the Congress, had no other option but to sell old wine in new bottles. However, by doing so, the government may face more trouble than it would have if it went without a scheme. If the Congress will go ahead with the policy, it will undermine Manmohan Singhs efforts to reduce state role in the economy, which forms the basis of liberalization. The revival of this outdated programme is unnecessary as the benefits of economic reforms are already evident. Surveys show that poverty in India has been reduced, although it has not been eradicated. The slogan, garibi hatao, is meant to hoodwink people, and the supposed beneficiaries farmers and labourers will gain nothing from it. The prime minister and his cabinet must not retract from the path of reforms.

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, Calcutta

 Sir The high birth rate of the poor and less educated will ensure the failure of garibi hatao. India had better spend resources on projects like the Golden Quadrilateral, which assure greater benefits to the country in the long run. We no longer live in an age when kings could demonstrate their benevolence through charity. However, since poverty is endemic in India, the government should persist with the new economic policy to create jobs and opportunities. Only in times of natural calamities or other large-scale disasters should it distribute food, clothes and other essentials among the poor. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Without hope 

 Sir The diffusion of two rockets near Islamabads Parliament House and the explosion close to Pervez Musharrafs Rawalpindi residence show that terrorism has slipped out of the hands of its Pakistani sponsors (After bomb, rockets in Pak, Oct 6). Thus, asking Pakistan to control terrorism is futile. There is also no reason to assume that Pakistan would like to give up its anti-India programme. Its terror outfits must be kept busy lest they cause damage at home. In such a situation, India must fend for itself. It has to start by dispelling its image as a soft state. Second, peace parleys, gas pipelines and trade links with Pakistan should be forgotten. The Kashmir problem needs to be resolved expeditiously. The relatively peaceful Ladakh and Jammu regions should be separated from Kashmir to focus attention exclusively on the valley. 

 Yours faithfully,

Raghubir Singh, Pune

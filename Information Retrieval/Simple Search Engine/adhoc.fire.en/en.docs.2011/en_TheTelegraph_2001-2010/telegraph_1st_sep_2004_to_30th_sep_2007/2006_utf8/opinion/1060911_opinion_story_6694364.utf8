 LESSONS FROM TERROR

 Gwynne Dyer

 Five years since 9/11, and we are still being told that the world has changed forever. But the terrorist attack on the United States of America was a low-probability event that could just as easily not have happened. The often careless and sometimes incompetent hijackers might have been caught before boarding those planes, and there were not ten other plots of similar magnitude stacked up behind them. Would the world really be all that different now if there had been no 9/11?

 There would have been no invasion of Afghanistan, and probably no second term for President George W. Bush, whose main political asset for the past five years has been his claim to be leading the US in a global war on terror. Deprived of the opportunity to posture as a heroic war leader in the mould of Winston Churchill or Franklin D. Roosevelt, Bush would have had great difficulty in persuading Americans that his first-term achievements merited a second kick at the can.

 Would Bush amp; Co have succeeded in invading Iraq anyway? Without the 9/11 attacks, they would have had great difficulty in persuading the American public that invading Iraq was a good idea. Whereas after 9/11, it was easy to sell the project to geographically-challenged Americans: maybe no Iraqis were involved in 9/11, but theyre all Arabs, arent they?

 Without 9/11 there would still be a terrorist threat because there is always some terrorism. Its rarely a big enough threat to justify expanding police powers, let alone launching a global war against it, but the fluke success of the 9/11 attacks created the illusion that terrorism was a major problem. Various special interests climbed aboard the band-wagon, and off we all went.

 Minimal damage

 That is a pity, because without 9/11 there would have been no governments justifying torture in the name of fighting terrorism, no special renditions, no camps like Guantanamo. Tens of thousands of people killed in the various invasions of the past five years would still be alive, and Western countries with large Muslim minorities would not now face a backlash at home from their own disaffected young Muslims. The US would not be seen as a rogue state. But thats as far as the damage goes.

 Economically, 9/11 and its aftermath have had almost no discernible long-term impact: even the soaring oil price is mostly due to rising demand in Asia, not to military events in the Middle East. The lack of decisive action on climate change is due to US policies that were in place before 9/11. And strategically, the relations between the great powers have not yet been gravely damaged by the US response to 9/11. 

 The war on terror is a profoundly dishonest concept, since it is actually directed mainly against Muslim groups that have grievances against great powers: Chechens against Russia, Muslim Uyghurs against China, Kashmiri Muslims and their Pakistani cousins against India, practically everybody in the Arab world and Iran against the US and Britain. The terrorists methods are reprehensible, but their grievances are often real. However, the determination of the great powers to oppose not only their methods but their goals is also real. That gives them a common enemy and a shared strategy.

 The main risk is that the great powers will drift back into some kind of alliance confrontation. Key resources are getting scarcer, the climate is changing, and the rise of China and India means that the pecking order of the great powers is due to change. Any strategic analyst, given those preconditions, could draw you up a dozen different scenarios of disaster by lunchtime.

 Avoiding that disaster at the expense of the worlds much-abused Muslims is not an acceptable option, but it appears to be the preferred solution at the moment. And that, five years on, is the principal legacy of 9/11.

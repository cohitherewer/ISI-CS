The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 CANNOT SAIL

 Leading Indian companies have been aware of the compulsions of globalization; some, especially in pharmaceuticals, have taken themselves abroad and expanded there. But nothing brought the implications more graphically than the spectacular bid of Mr Lakshmi Mittal for Arcelor. Mr Mittal was already the worlds biggest steelmaker before he wooed Arcelor. Those in the steel industry thought: if he can do it, they had better get ready for it. So Tata Steel abandoned its habit of sticking to its knitting and engineered a daring acquisition of Corus which would make it one of the worlds dozen biggest steelmakers. There are still some dissenting voices amongst Coruss shareholders. But since the two managements are agreed, a shareholders revolt is unlikely to upset the applecart. 

 The emotions that stirred the managers of Tata Steel are now spreading to other steelmakers. Jindal Steel, which prospered by making steel from scrap for local markets, is wondering how it can break out of India. Essar Steel, perpetually short of money, must be wondering which foreign company it can lure into bankrolling its expansion. But the biggest challenge is faced by Indias biggest steelmaker, SAIL. Being owned by the government, it would find it difficult to spread out abroad. Populist politicians would bridle at the idea of SAIL making steel abroad when so many Indians are starving for steel and waiting for jobs. SAIL cannot freely issue equity; and without equity it would find it difficult to borrow for acquisitions. And many countries, especially those with powerful steelmakers and large markets, would baulk at allowing in another governments stalking horse. 

 So for now, SAIL is only thinking of getting bigger so that it can look competitors in the face. With this object in view, it plans to build a greenfield plant in Jharkhand. It inherited Chiria mines there when it took over the sick man of Burnpur Indian Iron and Steel Company and was sitting on them; now it contemplates exploiting them. To do so it must make steel there, since Jharkhand would not allow the ore to leave the state. SAIL will probably make further moves to expand domestic capacity based on domestic resources to sell to the domestic market. But such a strategy is unlikely to make it a global player. It will be confined to the protected domestic market, its product range will be weighted towards low-value structurals, and its expansion will be limited by what money the Central government deigns to give it. Such are the unavoidable handicaps of a state enterprise.

 Connected to death

 Sir Cell phones are the bane of todays motorists. There have been many reports of mishaps taking place because the person on the wheel is busy taking a call while driving. The rise in the number of road accidents because of the phone menace prompted authorities to take some drastic steps. Talking on the phone while driving was banned and the police were instructed to fine those found breaking the rule. But it seems that very few people are willing to mend their errant ways. They would rather give up their life, than miss a precious call on their phone. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Bijita Roy, Sodepur

 Welcome back

 Sir The report, Card for hawkers (November 28), shows that the Left Front government is serious about legalizing the unauthorized occupancy of footpaths by hawkers. As a result of encroachment, footpaths have become exceedingly narrow. This has forced the pedestrians to take to roads, thereby increasing the number of accidents. It is shocking to see the government issuing identity cards to people who are, in fact, responsible for encroaching. 

 There is another side to this problem. Shop owners running legitimate businesses now find their storefronts blocked by vendors. This results in mounting losses, as a result of which their business suffers. Now, if the mayor, Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyya, has his way, things will take a turn for the worse. Not only the major roads, but also streets and bylanes would be taken over by card-holding hawkers. 

 The mayor has laid down some preconditions for hawkers. But there are some serious drawbacks in his plans. According to the proposed rules, the hawkers will not be allowed to set up permanent structures on the pavements. However, given the fact that most of the civic officials are susceptible to bribery, one can be certain that permanent structures would come up on the footpaths in a few days. And how exactly does the mayor plan to ensure that hawkers put up their stalls within 50 feet of crossings? Would he instruct his officials to be stationed near the crossings with a measuring tape, just to make sure that the hawkers are abiding by the rules? 

 Communists, all over the world, are known for taking decisions that go against the interest of the people. The Left Fronts decision to legalize hawkers has to be seen in this light. It is another example of a group of politicians trampling the rights of individuals to establish control over civil society.

 Yours faithfully,

Amit Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir The fact that the government has decided to issue identity cards to hawkers points to a deep rot that has set in the state administration. The chief minister, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, has been working hard to turn around Bengals economic fortunes. He even promised investors of a clean and caring administration. But the decision to welcome the hawkers back on the roads has shown that Bhattacharjee and his men do not really have the interest of the people on their minds. Allowing vendors to block pavements and forcing pedestrians to walk on the roads are not really the signs of a caring government.

 Yours faithfully,

 Parting shot

 Sir The two young cricketers, Mohammed Shaivaaz Tumbi and Manoj Kumar, deserve congratulations for putting up a record partnership of 721 runs in a school match (Manoj, Shaibaaz bask in glory, Nov 17). Perhaps, the board should now call upon the services of these two to revive Indias cricketing fortunes, given the seniors performance in South Africa.

 Yours faithfully,

 R. Sekar, Nalco Nagar, Orissa

 SHOOTING STARS

 It would surprise most believers if god loved Pramod Mahajan, who died at the relatively early age of 57. If there was divine intervention anywhere in Mahajan?s life, it was in the symmetry that emerged between the manner of his death and the way in which he lived. Despite the post-mortem encomia paid to him, there were many aspects of Mahajan?s career which were singularly unedifying. His death, however tragic, had a touch of sleaze. The horrid manner of his death cannot take away from the many layers of mystery and secrets that surround his murder. Mahajan?s origins were simple, but his lifestyle was not. The larger-than-life image that Mahajan acquired in his lifetime was related to his reputation as a go-getter in Delhi?s corridors of power. He often acted as an unofficial bridge between the world of politics and the world of business, between political power and economic power. He performed this role with aplomb both as a minister and as a fundraiser for the Bharatiya Janata Party. Mahajan?s origins were distant from the big and brash world that he came to inhabit. But he enjoyed his brief moment of glory in that world. In his career, his behaviour, his lifestyle and in his scorn for any anchoring principle, Mahajan perhaps epitomized the arrival of a new kind of politician.

 Getting things done was the motto of this new breed of politicians. These are, as Mahajan has been described, men in a hurry. And they did not let too many scruples or ideological considerations stand in the way of accomplishing their ends. They thus made themselves useful not only to their own political parties but also to industrialists and businessmen keen to push things along in the various ministries. A person whose ca- reer runs parallel to Mahajan?s in this regard is Mr Amar Singh, a stalwart of the Samajwadi Party. Like Mahajan, Mr Singh?s background is humble, but by sheer determination and a clever use of his skills, he too has made himself a formidable force in his party and in politics in general. By a bizarre coincidence, Mahajan?s cruel exit occurs at a time when Mr Singh also appears to be on the backfoot in politics. It is too early to suggest that the new breed of politicians, having blazed a trail like a meteor in the political firmament, is disappearing beyond the horizon. But history, like life, often has a symmetry.

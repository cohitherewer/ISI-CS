 Unhappy state of affairs

 Sir ? The policy of industrial disinvestment is going through a strange phase of twists and turns (?Glare and wink make PM blink?, July 7). Every time the prime minister or the finance minister announces some percentage of disinvestment in any public sector company, the left roars in protest and the reform measure is put on hold indefinitely, or withdrawn. The left claims that it is not opposed to divestment but that it wants only loss-making public sector units to be sold. However, it is obvious that there will hardly be any buyers, either institutional or individual, for these companies. Of late, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, in its own interest, has opposed the proposed sale of 10 per cent of the Neyveli Lignite Corporation. Although the DMK has its own champions of private enterprise like Dayanidhi Maran, the party finds it profitable to play vote-bank politics, projecting itself as the real benefactor of the NLC workers. Unfortunately, the prime minister has capitulated to its threat to pull out of the cabinet. Hence the proposal remains on hold. How long will Manmohan Singh run the country by yielding to such threats from his coalition partners? One day it is the left over disinvestment, the next day it is someone else over the reservations issue. The time has come for the prime minister, his party and its leader, Sonia Gandhi, to call their allies? bluff. Blackmail by any coalition partner should be met head-on. The Congress should accept the challenge and stand by its policies or else go for a fresh public mandate. Petty politicians with vested interests should not hold India?s future at ransom.

 Yours faithfully,

K. Venkataraman, Mumbai

 Sir ? Since the inauguration of the left-supported United Progressive Alliance government, the leftists have continuously and consistently tried to hoodwink the electorate. They are once again indulging in this game by deciding to observe an ?anti-price rise week? from July 13 through 19, merely to remind the people of their pro-poor, pro-people image. However, people are tired of these futile exercises that only cause hardship and harassment for ordinary civilians. The dual and paradoxical role of ?supporting inside and opposing outside?, played by leftists from time to time, has laid bare the two faces of the Indian left. It is time the communists shed their hypocrisy and took a stand one way or the other. Either they tell the government that unless it follows their prescription, its tenure would meet a premature end, or they should shut up and endorse the government?s proposals. To date, the left, for reasons best known to itself, has not dared to do either.

 Yours faithfully,

Satyananda Bhattacherjee, Kharagpur

 Sir ? The political events that have taken place over the last few days are certainly serious, if not grave, for they reflect on the authority of the prime minister. They also lend body to the argument that a two-party system is what India needs now, for a large coalition government has to abide by the demands of ?coalition dharma? that often puts the interest of the nation in jeopardy. While the DMK?s threat of a pullout over the NLC divestment issue is condemnable, the left?s repeated flaunting of its double standards is equally so. 

 One of the main pillars of the post-1991 economic reforms is a partial dilution of the public sector units. The deputy chairman of the Planning Commission has rightly pointed out that an 8 per cent growth is not sustainable without these measures. The UPA government has failed miserably in most important issues and has sought to divert public attention. The opposition has already declared Manmohan Singh ?unfit? to be prime minister. He should put in his papers, before he is called unfit by his own partymen.

 Yours faithfully,

Anurag Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? It has been proved that the tentacles of groups like the left and the DMK bind the UPA. They make and unmake government decisions. However, it must be said that Sonia Gandhi, by reportedly putting pressure on the prime minister, has managed to mollify the left and the DMK as well as keep its own voters out of worry for the time being.

 Yours faithfully,

Govinda Bakshi, Budge Budge

 Reacting too much

 Sir ? Israel seems to have started a full-scale war in Gaza over the kidnapping of one soldier (?Missile alert for Palestine PM?, July 3 and ?Gaza violence?, July 7). The Israeli prime minister has gone to the extent of saying that his country will do ?whatever it takes? to bring back the kidnapped soldier. This has meant attacking the Palestinian prime minister?s office and reducing it to rubble. This clearly shows that Israel is a terrorist state. There are many coalition soldiers dying in Iraq and Afghanistan and many are kidnapped. But the coalition forces or the individual armed forces have not been tempted to raze their surroundings to the ground, or target and kill civilians the way Israel has. For over-reacting to the situation, Israel should be immediately hauled up by the United Nations and asked to cease military action in Gaza and other Palestinian areas.

 Yours faithfully,

S. Kamat, Alto Porvorim, Goa

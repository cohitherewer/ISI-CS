 Letters to Editor

 The colour of money

 Sir ? The prime witness to the Salman Khan hit-and-run case has turned hostile, proving that money and power can help buy truth in a democracy such as ours (?Witness to Salman?s aid?, June 30). There is no respect for human life or dignity these days. However, the actor should not be allowed to go scot-free, just because a witness has reneged on his earlier words. Instead, the Mumbai police should work to strengthen their case against the guilty actor and ensure that eye witnesses do not turn hostile in cases such as these.

 Yours faithfully,

Saurik Ginoria, Calcutta

 Hand in the dirty pie

 Sir ? It is a matter of shame that ministers, bureaucrats and policemen have all landed in the net in the high-profile sex racket case in Kashmir ( ?Official surrenders in sex racket case?, June 22). These men have not only exploited innocent girls, but their actions have also tarnished the image of politicians. How can ordinary people trust politicians and lawkeepers if they end up abusing the people they are supposed to protect? The Central Bureau of Investigation has done a commendable job by arresting the offenders. The guilty must be duly punished so that people in positions of power will not dare to stoop to such levels in the future. 

 Yours faithfully,

Mohd. Mudassir Alam, New Delhi 

 Sir ? The lurid details of the sex scandal, put together by the CBI, paint a shocking picture of how influential men in the state government indulged in immoral activities. Such incidents make a mockery of the term ?civilized society?. It is because of incidents such as this that the people of Jammu and Kashmir look upon the state as their enemy. To make matters worse, those in power are only concerned about saving their skin rather than stem the rot. But, as in every other profession, there are some honest men in politics too. It should be their duty to fight against corrupt officials to help the system shed its ill-repute. 

 Yours faithfully,

Meghana Acharya, Hyderabad

 Sir ? It is heartening to note that the Bar Association of Jammu and Kashmir has instructed its members not to take up the cases of the accused in the infamous sex scandal involving senior politicians and bureaucrats. Legal practitioners do not generally let morality intervene in their profession. That is how even hardcore criminals get a lawyer to plead their cases. However, the Bar Association?s decision should inspire lawyers in other parts of India not to take up cases on behalf of criminals. 

 Yours faithfully,

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi

 Sir ? Prostitution, sex scandals and rapes make up most of the news everyday. It seems that Indians have been influenced by the sex and violence dished out by movies and soaps. So much so that many Indians are now ready to visit ?massage parlours?, which are nothing but cleverly disguised prostitution rackets. Sleaze has affected the common man and influential public servants alike. The only difference being people in the top rungs have the luxury to avail sexual favours on their own terms ? victimizing young, innocent, and almost always, poor people in the process.

 The sex racket in Kashmir is another reminder that something needs to be done to stop the exploitation of innocent women. Perhaps, the government should think of legalizing prostitution and issuing licences to sex workers. It should also make it mandatory for them to undergo regular health check-ups. This will not only bring down crimes against women but also help in reducing the trafficking of girls to neighbouring countries.

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

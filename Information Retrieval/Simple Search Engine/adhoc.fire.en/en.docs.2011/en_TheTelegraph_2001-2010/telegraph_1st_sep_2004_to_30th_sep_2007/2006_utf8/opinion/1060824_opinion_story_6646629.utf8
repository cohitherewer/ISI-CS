 WITHOUT ANY STRINGS ATTACHED

 Neha Sahay

 Help for pregnant girlfriend read the title of the message on the expat internet forum. Need to find a clinic...we arent ready to start a family and its getting urgent.

 Live-in relationships are not uncommon between expats and Chinese girls. Like Indians, Chinese too seem to have a fondness for whites age no bar. It, of course, helps immensely that most whites who come to China end up earning more than the average Chinese man. Then theres the aura of moving in expat circles.

 Live-in relationships are hassle free, specially in Chinas booming cities and on the coast, where young people come on their own, looking for jobs. Parents often never get to know. Landlords ask no questions.

 Not all such live-in relationships end with marriage. Normally, the white guy moves on to a new Chinese girl. As for the girl, its difficult to know whether she too moves on.

 Not all girls are lured by the colour of the mans skin. Sometimes, the couple meet at university where white teachers are much in demand. One such graduate left her hometown to move in with her white South African boyfriend, much to her educated and well-off parents displeasure, when he got a job in a South China university. Thanks to his connections, she got a job in a language institute, teaching Chinese to expats, and the two became a popular couple in expat circles till he found someone else. This however, rebounded on him. Her students practically the entire expat community rallied round her, and dropped him from all social and business deals.

 A matter of life

 But the same expat community looks the other way at similar behaviour by other members who are openly out to make the most of their stay in China. The explanation may lie with class: the Chinese teacher was educated, English-speaking, well-off, people like us; the serial girlfriends of some older foreigners are seen as part of the faceless mass of giggling Chinese good-time girls.

 Now Indians too are getting into the hang of things. Aslam is one such trend-setter. A 20-something bachelor who has been teaching English in China for the last two years, he recently acquired a live-in Chinese girlfriend, his colleague at the institute where he teaches. She speaks little English, his Chinese is no great shakes. She dislikes Indian food, and when he has Indian visitors, he cooks Indian, she Chinese. Obviously, their relationship does not depend on verbal communication. 

 Aslam is the archetypal Indian son whos never had to lift a finger at home. His wife will, of course, be chosen by his parents. Since hes ripe for marriage by Indian standards, he knows the next time he goes home, he wont return alone. Does his Chinese girlfriend know that? 

 The help for pregnant girl blogger never came back with information on whether he had found the help he required. But given the casual way abortion is treated in China, it shouldnt have been tough. Hong Kong girls often cross over to Guangzhou for their abortions: a ten-minute procedure and theyre back on the train to Hong Kong. They avoid the background checks, counselling and other formalities they would have to go through in Hong Kong .

 Abortion is seen as a birth- control measure and reportedly there is no time limit for the procedure. Last year, a blind activist lawyer exposed mass forced abortions in one county and was placed under arrest soon after. His trial took place last week without his lawyers. 

 However, whats interesting is the comments the blogger received after his cry for help. Please dont kill the baby said one; another, from a childless couple, offered to adopt it.

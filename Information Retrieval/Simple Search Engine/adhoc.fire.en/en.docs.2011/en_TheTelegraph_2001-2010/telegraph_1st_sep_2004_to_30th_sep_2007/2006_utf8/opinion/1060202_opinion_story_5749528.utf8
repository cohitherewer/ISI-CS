The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 AIDING AND ABETTING

 Satrujit Banerjee

 It was without doubt a bizarre report. Tucked away in the inside pages of this paper, it claimed that Britain?s Department for International Development has come under fire for allegedly using nearly ?27 million of taxpayers? money to make redundancy payments to workers in Bengal. It said that more than 3,000 employees facing dismissal from loss-making state-owned companies in Bengal will benefit from the severance fund set up by the department. 

 Before one could fully comprehend the absurdity of the situation, there was the riposte of the state?s industry minister, Nirupam Sen, to London?s Sunday Times, which confirmed one?s worst fears. ?We decided to restructure our loss-making enterprises ...one of the major issues was how to compensate the workers who will lose their jobs. The compensation is being provided by DFID?, he affirmed. Now if the state government had succeeded in persuading the workers of loss- making units to become ?redundant? against adequate payment, then it would be free to sell off the assets of the units, mostly by way of the land they occupied and recover the ?redundancy charges?.

 Begging bowl

 Though the state literally leads a hand-to-mouth existence, surely a loan from the time the workers are compensated to the time the sale of assets is completed could be arranged very easily. In the unlikely event of the retrenchment compensation exceeding the subsequent sale value of the unit, closing the unit would save the government recurring losses in future. This would mean that the excess amount paid would have to be written off in the current year, thus increasing the deficit, but the losses of the unit will not show up in subsequent years. Over a long period this is healthy for the budget.

 Then there is the Great Eastern Hotel, which was reportedly sold for ?6.5 million, the compensation paid to workers being ?2.5 million. The government thus reaped a profit of ?4 million. In this case, should the government have asked DFID, as it did, for the ?2.5 million? By doing what it did, our state government has, in effect, asked for and received a handout from DFID. It is not surprising that Sunday Times termed the episode ?a scandal?. 

 Short-term gains

 A bail out of this nature does more harm than good to the state?s economy as it provides short-term relief rather than a long-term solution. If, after 28 years of being in power, the Left Front has left the state in such a financial plight that it cannot pay for redundancies, then the logical solution is downsizing the government and reducing wasteful expenditure. Handouts will only delay the inevitable and make the cure that much difficult. While this solution has not been provided by the state government, how the illogic of it escaped Suma Chakrabarti, DFID?s permanent secretary who helped negotiate the agreement and who must have been schooled in Thatcheronomics, is surprising.

 There is another aspect to this sordid episode. The United Kingdom has been the closest ally of the United States of America in the war against Iraq right from the start, and is equally committed. Left Front leaders and policy-makers without exception in Calcutta, New Delhi and elsewhere have taken vile potshots at this ?lackey? of imperialist US in their criticism against the war. Countless effigies of Tony Blair too have been burned. It seems that it does not pose a moral dilemma to them to curse Britain and yet place the begging bowl at its feet at the same time. But for Sunday Times, this demeaning episode would have been kept under wraps forever. It is time for Left Front leaders to realize that they also represent people with convictions and dignity though they themselves may not have any.

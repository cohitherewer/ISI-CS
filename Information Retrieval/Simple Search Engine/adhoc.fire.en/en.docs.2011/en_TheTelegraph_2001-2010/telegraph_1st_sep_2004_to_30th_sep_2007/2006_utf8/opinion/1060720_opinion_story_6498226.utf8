 MINOR WRONGS

 ?Children? is a loaded word in respectable society. Indeed, the idea ? largely constructed by middle-class adults ? of children as naturally innocent, asexual and vulnerable creatures in need of adult care and protection is one of the pillars of respectability. It has been institutionalized by moralists, educationists and lawmakers, and globalized by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. This is the notion of childhood enshrined in the Indian Penal Code and the Juvenile Justice Act. Hence, makers and keepers of the law, and well-meaning adults in general, feel deeply disconcerted when children show themselves capable of brutal sexual crimes. Of the 300-odd cases being tried at the Salt Lake juvenile court, 70 per cent relate to sexual offences; it used to be around 15 per cent. Of this 70 per cent, most of the offenders are between 12 and 16 years of age, and their victims between three and eight.

 Indian society and law are profoundly uncomfortable with the sexuality of ?minors?, even when the law generally continues to deem them children until as late as the age of eighteen. So a very large proportion of post-pubertal minors remain within the purview of ?juvenile justice? and the notions of sexual innocence, incapacity and vulnerability informing these laws. In everyday life, these notions give rise to a wide range of repressions ? in the family and school, and within the medical professions ? which result in the denial of children?s sexuality, mostly regarded as deserving to be disciplined or punished. This denial of what the UNCRC calls the ?evolving capacity? of children could also result in the criminalization of their normal developmental behaviour. The easy way out is, of course, to blame television and the internet. There is, undeniably, a wide and potentially damaging gap between sexual knowledge and practice among young people in India, although the nature and extent of this gap varies according to social and economic background. But it would be dangerous, and entirely counter-productive, to try to close it with further denial and repression. Young people should be made better informed about their own and their peers? bodies and minds, and those of their elders as well. They should be able to access, receive, assimilate and act upon such information in an atmosphere as free from prejudice as possible. This does not preclude the possibility of care and protection.

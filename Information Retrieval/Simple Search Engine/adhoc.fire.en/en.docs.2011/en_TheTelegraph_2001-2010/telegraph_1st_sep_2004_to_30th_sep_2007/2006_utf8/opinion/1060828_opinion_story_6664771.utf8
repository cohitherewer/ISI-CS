 POWER TO THE ENVIRONMENT 

 DOCUMENT

 Excerpts from the International Atomic Energy Agencys Nuclear Technology Review 2006

 Contributors to the rise in expectations are nuclear powers good and lengthening track record, the persistent growth in global energy needs, new environmental constraints, concerns in some countries about energy supply security, and specific nuclear power expansion plans in countries such as India, China, Japan, the Republic of Korea and the Russian Federation... 

 Nuclear powers good and lengthening track record is reflected in ... improved capacity factors, lower generating costs and an excellent safety record. There has been one accident with major off-site consequences at Chernobyl in 1986. 

 That accident cost lives and caused widespread misery. But it also brought about major changes including the founding of a safety culture of constant improvement, thorough analysis of experience and sharing of best practices. This safety culture has been demonstrating its effectiveness for nearly two decades, and this safety record provides the basis for countries considering constructing nuclear power plants.

 Persistently growing global energy needs in the century ahead are projected in all independent analyses and forecasts. If the world is to meet even a fraction of the economic aspirations of the developing world, energy supplies must expand significantly. Oil and natural gas prices rose substantially in 2005, reflecting market expectations that demand will grow faster than supply...

 Although expectations for nuclear power are rising, a recent global public opinion survey commissioned by the Agency shows a continuing diversity of views. The survey polled 18 000 people in 18 countries... 

 A majority of 62 per cent wished to keep current plants running at the same time that a majority of 59 per cent did not want new plants built. A follow-up question was also asked that included brief information about nuclear powers very low greenhouse gas emissions, following which the percentage in favour of expanding nuclear power rose from 28 per cent to 38 per cent, and the percentage opposing expansion dropped from 59 per cent to 47 per cent... 

 The UN Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) first took up the topic of energy at its ninth session in 2001, and the relationship between nuclear energy and sustainable development was debated thoroughly. The outcome was twofold. First, parties agreed to disagree, with the final text observing that some countries view nuclear energy as an important contributor to sustainable development and others do not. Second, parties agreed that the choice of nuclear energy rests with countries....

 The Kyoto Protocol entered into force in February 2005 and requires most developed countries to limit their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the first commitment period, 20082012. 

 Different countries have adopted different policies to meet their Kyoto Protocol limits. Not all benefit nuclear power despite its low GHG emissions, but in the longer run, the limits on GHG emissions should make nuclear power increasingly attractive. In the past its advantage of very low GHG emissions has been invisible to investors, as the lack of restrictions or taxes on such emissions meant there was no economic value to their avoidance. 

 The 11th Conference of the Parties to the UN Convention on Climate Change (CoP-11) in Montreal in December 2005 was the first to take place after entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol ... it formally adopted the rules for implementing the Kyoto Protocol that were preliminarily adopted at CoP-7 as the Marakkesh Accords. With respect to emission reductions after the first commitment period (2008- 2012), it decided to start discussions in an open-ended ad hoc working group which shall aim to complete its work as early as possible and in time to ensure that there is no gap between the first and second commitment periods. 

 In these discussions, an important issue for nuclear power will be the fate of the current exclusion, during the first commitment period, of nuclear power projects from two of the three flexible mechanisms in the Kyoto Protocol, specifically the clean development mechanism and joint implementation.

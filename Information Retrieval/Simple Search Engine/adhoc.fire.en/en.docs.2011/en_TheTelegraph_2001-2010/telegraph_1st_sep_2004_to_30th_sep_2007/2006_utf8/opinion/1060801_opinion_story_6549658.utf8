The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 FALL IN EDEN

 Despite what the numbers clearly demonstrate, there may not be any victors in the aftermath of the elections held in the Cricket Association of Bengal. Of course, there can be no doubt that Mr Jagmohan Dalmiya has scored a personal triumph by defeating Calcutta?s commissioner of police, Mr Prasun Mukherjee, a candidate who had the direct and overt support of the chief minister, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. It was really a battle against the chief minister that Mr Dalmiya has won, showing that the CAB is his personal bailiwick. But he might begin to ponder if this is the best way to run an important sports association. Mr Dalmiya has been at the helm of affairs in the CAB for far too long. This has inevitably created vested interests within the organization, and hostility and discontent. Such developments, never healthy, are consequences of Mr Dalmiya?s attempts to cling to office even after he has been the head of the Board of Control for Cricket in India and of the International Cricket Council. Discontented elements within the CAB, by no means a minuscule minority as the voting figures make evident, had no other option but to seek state intervention to challenge Mr Dalmiya?s control and dominance. The threat that Mr Dalmiya faced and overcame grew out of these circumstances. His victory at the hustings will only aggravate discontent and factionalism to the detriment of cricket in West Bengal. The return of Mr Dalmiya thus cannot be celebrated as a moment of liberation for the CAB. Perhaps the time has come for Mr Dalmiya to take a leaf out of the books of Mr Bill Gates and Mr N.R. Narayana Murthy, who are willing to step down from office in institutions they themselves have built.

 For the chief minister who took it upon himself to oust Mr Dalmiya from the CAB, the election results should come as a salutary warning about the limits of his power. Ironically, the setback in the CAB came immediately on the eve of the signing of the deal with the Salim group, an event that most people see as the chief minister?s most important achievement in beginning the industrial rejuvenation of West Bengal. Mr Bhattacharjee should become more conscious of the pitfalls of state intervention in the institutions of civil society. Such attempts can be as harmful as state intervention in economic affairs. The setback that Mr Bhattacharjee has suffered in the CAB was brought upon himself by himself. He not only made the CAB elections a personal vendetta against Mr Dalmiya, but he also involved the state administration in the process by making Calcutta?s police commissioner his sponsored candidate. It was a battle he could have done without. The people of West Bengal expect bigger things from him than being embroiled in petty battles to control the CAB. Mr Bhattacharjee should not indulge in the common delusion of popular political leaders that they are the monarchs of all they survey. A little humility goes a long way.

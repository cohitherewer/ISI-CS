The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 AT LAST

 It will remain a mystery why it took the prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, ten months to appoint a foreign minister. The choice of Mr Pranab Mukherjee suggests that there was no major initiative to think out of the box. Considerations of seniority and experience have prevailed over any attempt to seek new talent. There is no evidence, of course, that Mr Singh was actually seeking new talent. But if he was not, the question of what took him so long to fill a vacancy in a crucial portfolio will remain something of an enigma. It is not difficult to imagine that tortuous negotiations involving a balancing act between the demands of the Congress and the demands of the government worked behind the scenes before there was an agreement on the present incumbent. Mr Mukherjee brings to the job a wealth of experience. He has held the ministry before and he has the reputation of being a master of details and the files. While this mastery is a necessary condition for holding any ministry, it is not a sufficient one for being the minister of external affairs. The ideal head of the foreign ministry should be a man with a vision about Indias place in the sun. Such a vision cannot emanate from the files. It has to come not only from the minister but also from the prime minister himself. The foreign minister and the prime minister must learn to tango together.

 The working out of this equation between Mr Singh, a former mandarin, and Mr Mukherjee, a veteran minister and a pretender to the top job at one time, may have been one of the causes of the inordinate delay. Be that as it may, Mr Mukherjee takes over the reins of the foreign ministry in somewhat stormy times. He has to steer the Indo-US nuclear deal at a time when the conditions of internal politics within the United States of America are not favourable to such a deal. To make matters worse, the turn of events in North Korea has already muddied the murky waters of nuclear diplomacy. Further, there is an apparent mismatch between Indias growing economic power and the countrys position in global diplomacy. It is ironic that, under Jawaharlal Nehru, when India counted for nothing in the world economy, its opinion on world affairs was considered important. This was directly related to Nehrus vision. It is only by redrawing that vision to suit contemporary times that Mr Mukherjee can go down in history as a successful foreign minister.

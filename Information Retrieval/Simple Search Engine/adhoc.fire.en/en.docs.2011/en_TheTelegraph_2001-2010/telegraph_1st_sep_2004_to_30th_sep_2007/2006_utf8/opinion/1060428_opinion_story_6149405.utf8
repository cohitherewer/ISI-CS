 Letters to Editor

 Dusk falling

 Sir ? Ramachandra Guha, in his article, ?Calling it quits?(April 1), has missed the crucial point ? that the wisdom of an experienced man is always more valuable than the amateurish considerations of immature minds. The nation?s history records that the valuable observations by policy-makers like Vidura, Vashistha and Chanakya showed the way to later generations at the helm of affairs. Of late, the storehouses of wisdom are no longer valued. It is true that they are not always good at keeping up with new trends, but that is hardly any reason to ignore their worth. Considering that Verghese Kurien made significant contributions during to the milk cooperative movement, it would not be wise to ignore the enormous possibilities still latent in him. In fact, a person with a sound mind and leadership qualities should not be forced to quit unless he is seriously considered unfit to be in service. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad 

 Sir ? The bitter reality is that Indian achievers just refuse to retire even when their time is up. Apart from the exceptions mentioned by Ramachandra Guha, two other personalities come to mind who called it a day with dignity. Ranjit Mullick stopped playing the hero in Bengali films even when he was enjoying popular support. Sunil Gavaskar too had many years of cricket left in him when he retired; in his last test innings in Bangalore, he scored a brilliant 96 against Pakistan on an under-prepared pitch. 

 However, Guha is wrong to suggest that the time has not yet come for Tendulkar to leave. Rather, he should have left the field at least a year ago. By failing in his last 11 test innings and performing much below par in one-dayers, and still refusing to quit, Tendulkar is only falling in people?s esteem. He should take a cue from the original Little Master and call it a day, lest his honour and reputation be compromised. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kajal Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? ?Calling it quits? was a timely and pragmatic article. Either performance, or considerations of age, or both should be the grounds for politicians, sportspersons and high officials in public or private sectors to step down. Many in the latter category are known to appeal for extensions of their tenure. However, the worst culprits are our politicians who make us suffer their senile babblings till they bite the dust. As for sportsmen, they should emulate the legendary cricketers like Vijay Merchant and Steve Waugh, who involved themselves wholeheartedly in a noble cause after retiring.

 Yours faithfully,

J.C. Ray Chaudhury, Chinsurah

 New wave

 Sir ? The frontpage report, ?CM works on Mission Smart? (April 23), eulogizes the West Bengal chief minister for his efforts to bring about a radical change in the state?s governance. Under this programme, Bhattacharjee must look for at least two education ministers ? one for higher education and another for the school level. Now that the state?s education policy is in a shambles, the chief minister?s search for search for a new education minister must have grown quite desperate. He can go the Greg Chappell way and stud his new cabinet with youthful, vibrant and aggressive men, who are tuned to modern trends. Most of the left mandarins want a change in the finance ministry as well. It might be a good idea to give Asim Dasgupta the education portfolio, keeping in mind his academic career. 

 Yours faithfully,

Tarakdas Majumder, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is commendable that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has been successful despite the fact that his cabinet consisted of a number of old-fashioned ministers who refused to accept the various economic, social and industrial changes taking place all over the world, including communist-run China. It is a foregone conclusion that the Left Front will be back in power as there is no alternative political force to put up a fight. Young and dynamic professionals should be made ministers while their senior cabinet colleagues should be sent to work at the grassroots level. But the question is: will Bhattacharjee get a free hand? 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Bitter pill

 Sir ? The report, ?Malaria botch rap on World Bank?(April 26), lambasts the government of India more than the World Bank. It seems that the government has accepted the bank?s funding of the use of chlorine for a deadly form of malaria that is chloroquine-resistant, against the WHO?s recommendations for the drug artemisinin and combination therapies. This inappropriate drug treatment contributes to the spawning of plasmodium; hence the discrepancy in the statistics of the government and that of the World Bank. The World Bank is also responsible sanctioning funds for a treatment that will only aggravate the disease and claim more lives. As for the government, the combination therapy only serves to save precious lives, while cheaper chloroquine yields a very good value for money. 

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 A TREK TO THE STARS

 GWYNNE DYER

 It was vintage Stephen Hawking. The worlds most famous astrophysicist, while receiving the Royal Societys Copley Medal, Britains highest scientific award, used the opportunity to warn that the long-term survival of the human race is at risk so long as it is confined to a single planet. 

 Sooner or later, disasters such as an asteroid collision or nuclear war could wipe us all out, Hawking said after the ceremony. But once we spread out into space and establish independent colonies, our future should be safe. There isnt anywhere like the Earth in the solar system, so we would have to go to another star.

 By sheer coincidence, just three months ago, a decision was made to take the first baby steps in that direction: Were going for a base on the Moon, said Scott Horowitz, associate administrator for exploration of Nasa, in mid-September.

 It was part of the roll-out of Nasas plans for the new spacecraft that will replace Americas ageing and accident-prone Space Shuttle fleet, which will be retired in 2010. The Orion vehicles will revert to the simpler methods of the Apollo spacecraft that flew the manned moon missions in 1968-72, launching into orbit atop large rockets and descending back to Earth by parachute, but their technology will be half a century better.

 New home

 The first job of the Orions when they enter service in 2014 will be to meet American commitments in support of the International Space Station. By 2020, however, Michael Griffin, chief Nasa administrator, promises that an Orion will carry a four-person mission to the Moon, the first human visit in almost fifty years. But this time, he said, the visitors will be going to stay and to extend human presence across the Solar System and beyond.

 The base will be near one of the Moons poles, as those are the only parts of the surface where there is continuous sunlight to provide power. It will serve not only as a science centre but a possible stepping stone to Mars. That is about one hundred times as far away but manned missions to Mars are now officially on the agenda.

 It is a bit late, but full credit to President George W. Bush, who responded to the latest Shuttle disaster by becoming the first American leader to get serious about space flight. The question is whether the commitment will survive Bushs departure in two years time: a Congress bitter about the lost war in Vietnam gutted the funding for the first US Moon project, and a Congress bitter about the lost war in Iraq could do the same again.

 Safe bet

 This time, however, the US is no longer the only major player. The European Union and Russia are doing a feasibility study for a joint rocket and manned vehicle programme based on their existing Ariane and Soyuz technologies, China is already in the manned space-flight business, and both Japan and India have clear ambitions in that direction. 

 With or without American involvement, bases on the Moon are likely in less than twenty years, and on Mars in perhaps another decade. That does not really add up to independent colonies that satisfy Hawkings criteria because humans cannot live anywhere in the solar system apart from Earth. To find other habitable planets, we must go to the stars, a journey many times farther than the trip to Mars.

 Barring some unforeseen technological revolution, that will not happen in this century. But unless global civilization suffers an early and compre- hensive collapse, the logic of human history suggests that it will happen eventually.Will that finally make us safe from extinction? A little bit safer, maybe, but any technology that can take us to the stars can probably also destroy whole planets at interstellar range. No matter how far we go, we can never get away from ourselves.

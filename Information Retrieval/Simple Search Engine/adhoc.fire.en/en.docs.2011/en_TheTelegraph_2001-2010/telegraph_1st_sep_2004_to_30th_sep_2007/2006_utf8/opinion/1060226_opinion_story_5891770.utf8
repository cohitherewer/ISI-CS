 Letters to Editor

 All that glitters

 Sir ? The Chatwal extravaganza continues to appear in the media days after it ended. I fail to understand our pride in such a show in a country where over two-thirds of the population do not have enough to eat. The Chatwals may have tried to showcase India to affluent guests, but did they entirely miss the reality while driving around in their airconditioned Maybachs, BMWs and Mercedes? Indian tycoons have every right to spend their money as they wish, but is it really necessary to hold such an obscene display of wealth here?

 Yours faithfully,

 A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Courting trouble

 Sir ? The Jodhpur court?s verdict against Salman Khan has created a considerable stir, possibly because of his celebrity status (?Guilty?, Feb 18). But numerous cases involving important personalities are either languishing in court for years or have already died a silent death, courtesy our judicial system. The rise in the crime rate is directly related to the time taken in the delivery of justice. Cases filed against legislators, ministers and other public servants and celebrities should be disposed of as quickly as possible. If the guilty are readily punished in such high-profile cases, the courts will be sending out a strong message to society.

 Yours faithfully, 

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? The killing of a rare deer and the one-year sentence handed out to Salman Khan make up just another episode in the actor?s adventurous life. He has been involved in similar such cases before, and has always managed to wriggle out of them. Our judicial system has so many loopholes that it is always possible for the rich and powerful to go scot-free. Look at the verdict in the Jessica Lal case. 

 As expected, the actor will appeal in the sessions court and another lengthy procedure will begin. If the government has to bring these culprits to book, the relevant laws should be amended and the legal process speeded up.

 Yours faithfully,

Sumant Poddar, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The Jodhpur court sentence conveys a strong message to poachers. Our forests are being ravaged by the wood mafia and poachers who fell ancient trees, kill animals for their teeth and skin to sell in the market. Forest officials, who are supposed to stop them, either lack the commitment or are in league with them. There is an acute shortage of manpower, with only one forest guard ? armed with nothing but a stick and cut off from all means of communication ? being assigned for every 5 to 15 sq km. One practical solution to the problem would be to create parks to breed rare animals like the chinkaras. These will attract tourists and ward off smugglers. 

 Yours faithfully,

Rajdeep Patnaik, Cuttack

 Sir ? The court verdict against Salman Khan once again proves that nobody is above the law. The reel hero is actually a criminal who has no respect for the country?s laws. This is a useful lesson for the younger generation who idolize these actors for their larger-than-life screen persona. 

 Yours faithfully,

Parakram Paul, Calcutta

 Sir ? Salman Khan deserved a stronger sentence. What remains unclear is the court?s decision to acquit the other accused. The producers, who are now raising a hue and cry about the judgment, should not have invested in Salman Khan in the first place. A court case is not resolved overnight. Besides, the actor has been accused in at least two other cases, one a hit-and-run. The producers knowingly took a risk, and they alone are responsible for it. 

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta

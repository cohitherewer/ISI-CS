The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 Politics does not only make strange bedfellows, politics itself is an uncomfortable sleeping partner. Manmohan Singh has surely learnt this during his stint as prime minister. His style of functioning has left many saying that the economist-turned-politician is too gentle to deal with hawkish allies, squabbling partymen, nitpicking opposition, the hounding media and so on. Not being a typical canny politician, the prime minister is also not good at hiding his distress; hence those candid shots, with hand on a creased forehead. Sonia Gandhi too, it is alleged, is not doing enough to extend protection to her chosen candidate for the PM?s post. But for most Congress insiders, the real culprit is Ahmad Patel, who hasn?t been the greatest backroom manager the Congress has had. A UPA minister has even been heard remembering the hands-on expertise of Pramod Mahajan in managing the image of his party and its leaders.

 While Manmohan Singh frets and fidgets wearing the trappings of power, someone else is gearing up for the top job. And how! Atal Bihari Vajpayee is a slim ? well, ?slimmer?, if you like ? man these days. A dedicated foodie who, it is said, breakfasted on kebabs and ghee-soaked parathas, has given up on some of his favourite, but sinful, food, such as sweets. He has even started exercising. So 81 is not too late to start building a body. And why not too? Not everyday does the prime minister?s chair beckon a politician. The news doing the rounds now is that Vajpayee is also willing to contest the next Lok Sabha elections. So what if he had announced his retirement from electoral politics? Great men are allowed to change their minds.

 The BJP?s grand old man has taken to a healthy life. Can the younger Turks remain far behind? Rahul Gandhi has planned to set up a series of gymnasiums in his constituency, Amethi, as a tribute to his father. No points for guessing that these will be called ?Rajiv Gandhi gyms?. The number of such gyms lined up is 25, each costing around two lakh rupees. Young men of Amethi will have to pay a nominal charge of Re 1 to use these gyms in between sessions of kheti-bari. Don?t be surprised if there is an Olympic medal or two for India from Amethi a few years down the line.

 The public sector companies, derided by all and sundry as the government?s white elephants, are having a tough time. First the Lok Sabha speaker, Somnath Chatterjee, picked on them when he needed funds for his pet project of a 24-hour Lok Sabha channel. And then, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, the face of Indian football who has never played the game, made the ONGC chief sign a cheque for Rs 5 crore in favour of the All India Football Federation. The question is, how much of the cheque has been spent towards sending Das Munshi to Germany?

 Suddenly the government is all het up about terrorist threat to the Ram Mandir. Its logic is that any attack on it will immediately trigger riots. So the idea of further fortification with Fort-Knox-like barriers, steel walls, and closed-circuit television. But the proposal has met with resistance from the minority communities. Their logic: the proposed construction will make what is a court-ordained ?temporary? building ? housed now under a tarpaulin cover ? into a permanent structure.

 The Congress may be running a shaky coalition, but that doesn?t mean it is neglecting international vigilance. In fact, after it received a representation from the British Labour Party on cooperating on the cause of the ethnic minorities in the two countries, the Congress instructed its partymen visiting the UK to look up the Tory leadership. Wonder why? Because in the Congress?s assessment, Tony Blair?s Labour has made too many blunders to regain power. Therefore the cosying up to the future winners.

 What is Kapil Dev?s favourite sport? Cricket? Golf? No, the answer is Sudoku. Ask anyone who?s flown with him recently.

 R.K. Dhawan is a lonely man these days. Of course, after spending time lording over the corridors of power, being away from the spotlight cannot be easy. The once powerful PA to Indira Gandhi now whiles away most of his time telling stories about the good old days, while still nursing a wish to return to mainstream politics. But no, the governor?s job is not to his liking. Too staid perhaps? Here?s a story of the Indira raj which Dhawan loves telling. Once, after seeing Dhawan sport a new watch, the iron lady asked ?Oh you are wearing a new watch Dhawan?? The meaning was not lost on the wily PA, who quickly gathered that the number one rule in the PA bible was to be inconspicuous and stay above suspicion. But what one doesn?t understand is why Dhawan is wasting his time in plotting a return to Madam Sonia?s durbar when he could be better off writing a book on how to become a successful PA.

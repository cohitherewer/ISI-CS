 IN THE WORKS

 The results of the by-elections in Bengal are fairly predictable, but their political messages may not be immediately obvious. The first message is that, contrary to what the opposition parties say, the Congresss victory in the Malda parliamentary constituency or the Trinamool Congresss win in the Bongaon assembly seat is not a vindication of the so-called mahajot thesis. In both cases, the Congresss strategy of weaning Ms Mamata Banerjee away from her alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party worked. On the other hand, her thesis of the anti-left mahajot or the grand alliance, which includes the BJP, has proved unworkable. So it is Ms Banerjee who has finally accepted the Congresss strategy and succeeded and not the other way around. Whether she follows this strategy in the future is another matter. But the by-elections prove, if further proof was needed, that the only effective anti-left combine in Bengal is the one that has the Congress and the Trinamool Congress. It is time Ms Banerjee realized this, gave the mahajot idea a quick and complete burial and left the BJPs company, which she barely keeps anyway. She had done so in 2001, but clearly made a mistake by subsequently returning to the BJPs fold. A Congress-Trinamool alliance may take time to match the lefts organizational power, but only that can be a credible alternative to the left. 

 The other important message comes from a true reading of the verdict in Malda. And it comes with greater clarity if one contrasts this verdict with the one from the district in the assembly polls last May. The Congress had been way behind the left in Malda then. The pro-change image of the chief minister, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, had been a major factor in Malda, as elsewhere in the state in the May polls. But in the parliamentary polls, Malda showed its traditional Congress loyalty. The Malda result thus punctures the myth about the constituency being a personal fiefdom of the late Congress leader, A.B.A. Ghani Khan Choudhury. It proves once again that the personal charisma of individuals, except in isolated cases, is secondary to the peoples loyalty to ideologies and organizations. Malda belongs to the Congress much more than it did to Choudhury. The results should finally make it clear to Ms Banerjee that her political future will remain uncertain outside the Congress or without an alliance with it.

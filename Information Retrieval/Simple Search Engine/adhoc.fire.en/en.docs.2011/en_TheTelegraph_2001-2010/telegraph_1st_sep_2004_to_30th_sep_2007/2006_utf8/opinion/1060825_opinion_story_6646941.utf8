 THE THREAT TO NATIVE IDENTITY

 Alternative DiscourSes in Asian 

 Social Science: Responses to Eurocentrism

 By Syed Farid Alatas,

 Sage, Rs 550

 A short poem in Ladera Este, Octavio Pazs book of poems, speaks of a man who invented a face for himself. His original face eventually carries the wrinkles from that Face while his wrinkles have no Face. These lines touch upon the imperceptibility of the cultural mask of a colonized race. In Black Skin, White Masks, Frantz Fanon describes the colonized slave as less independent than the Hegelian slave because, unlike the latter, he does not run away from but turns towards the master and abandons the object. 

 Post-colonial studies in the last three decades have shown that, in the Asian context, the cultural transaction between the colonizer and the colonized has not been as simplistic and unidirectional as Fanons view suggests. What Fernand Braudel termed as borrowings and diffusion in the article, A history of civilizations, are very much evident in this cultural negotiation. But the turning-towards-the-master syndrome still persists in the Asian cultural perception. 

 In Alternative Discourses in Asian Social Science, Syed Farid Alatas defines the same syndrome as cultural imperialism, which, to his mind, entails a wholesale, as also a critical, incorporation of the Western paradigms and methodologies in the Asian social sciences, anthropology, culture studies, psychoanalytic practices, development theories and so on. Alatas demonstrates that this Euro-centric bias is operative in both the epistemological and rhetorical level. He explains its origin and goes on to trace dissenting voices raised in different phases of a broad-based programme called the endogenous intellectual activity, which intends to indigenize derived notions of the West, while fostering native theories like that of Ibn Khaldun, the Arab social scientist, alongside it. In this context, Alatas points out the significant emergence of meta-analysis, which juxtaposes diverse Asian communities under a common theoretical platform to examine their internal structures. 

 Some of the counter-hegemonic discourses that Alatas refers to are Edward Saids Orientalism, Samir Amins Eurocentrism, and Syed Hussein Alatass essay, The captive mind in development studies. He cites, as his endogenous models, T.K. Oommens Alien Concepts and South Asian Reality: Responses and Reformations and Sudhir Kakars Shamans, Mystics and Doctors: A Psychological Inquiry into India and its Healing Traditions, both of which contrast the Asian self with the Western.

 Alatass study encompasses a pan-Asian perspective within a wide spectrum of subjects. His chief objective is to strike at the base of the Foucauldian knowledge-power homology, which sustains the audacious claims of truth by most Western theories. But thankfully enough, Alatas cautions his reader against another extreme namely a nativistic parochialism, be it Asian or Western.

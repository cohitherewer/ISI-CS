The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 FREEDOM ON SCREEN

 Neha Sahay

 People here are both surprised and dismayed at the ban on The Da Vinci Code. The film, which opened here three weeks back (with Chinese subtitles), was so popular that only the most expensive tickets (40 yuan in small cities) were available at the current booking counter in the first week. Many people here have read the book in its Chinese translation, and were waiting for the first rush to die out before going for the film. 

 Foreign films are released here only after they meet certain complex criteria; The Da Vinci Code had obviously done so. With religion being so unobtrusive a part of Chinese society, and Christianity even more so, it remains inexplicable to the average Chinese how their government can ban a film found offensive by a microscopic minority of believers. The fact that China does not even recognize the Vatican adds to the mystery. 

 Initially, the Patriotic Catholic Association ( the state-backed Church) had asked its members to boycott the film, and some Catholics actually demonstrated against its release in Heibei province. Considering that the Chinese government is immune even to self-immolation bids in Tiananmen Square over basic issues like forced evictions and land takeovers, it seems curious that it bowed down to these protests. Incidentally, The Da Vinci Code is the first film to be banned after being allowed to be released. 

 Mission Impossible III may not be released at all, ironically, because of its China connection. It was shot in Shanghai amid much hype after China?s censors approved its script. But the finished version has offended the sensibilities of the censors because certain scenes depict Shanghai as less than the glittering showpiece of modern China. These scenes show clothes, specifically rags and underwear, hanging out of balconies in old Shanghai. Much in the manner of Hindi film industry spokespersons of the Sixties, who questioned Satyajit Ray?s motives in making films depicting the lives of poor Indians, the authorities are aghast that the director actually chose to focus his camera on sights they wished didn?t exist. 

 Without cuts

 The portrayal of the Shanghai police has also earned the authorities? disapproval. Imagine showing them arriving at the scene of crime a minute later than they should have. Never mind that in the mind of the average Chinese, the police are synonymous with corruption. 

 In this case, leading columnists have criticized the authorities in China?s official newspaper. If the film shows drying laundry, it also showcases the Pudong Park area, they point out, which is Shanghai?s most advanced district. Besides, hanging clothes out to dry isn?t exactly a crime, they add. Foreigners have written letters to the editor stressing that drying clothes in balconies, instead of using dryers, is environmentally friendly. This debate on censorship and cinema is on a scale qualitatively different from what Indians are used to. How would the authorities have reacted if the film had shown beggars in Shanghai looking into the glass fronts of coffee shops? 

 As for the bumbling police, the columnists point out that few thrillers in the West would ever be made if the filmmakers had to worry about the image of the police. Like Mission Impossible III, Memoirs of a Geisha, was also banned because of its Chinese connection. The reason remained vague: it was either because it was considered unpatriotic of Gong Li and Zhang Ziyi, the film?s Chinese lead actresses, to play Japanese courtesans, or simply because anything Japanese is considered offensive. 

 In the end, however, all this censorship is pointless. Pirated DVDs of all these films are available for less than 10 yuan on every street. Again, it?s the market economy so beloved of China?s rulers at work. Only this time, it?s unplanned.

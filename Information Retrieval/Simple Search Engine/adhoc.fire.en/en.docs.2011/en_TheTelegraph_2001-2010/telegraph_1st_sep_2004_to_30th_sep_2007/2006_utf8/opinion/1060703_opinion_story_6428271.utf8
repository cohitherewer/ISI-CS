 ISLANDING INDIA?S NUCLEAR CAPABILITY

Twenty-Twenty - Bharat Bhushan

 Steely grip

 The law permitting American nuclear cooperation with India is likely to be enacted by the end of July. The adoption of two different versions of the bill by the House and the Senate committees of the US Congress has been packaged by New Delhi as a major victory. The two versions of the bill will now be reconciled and then voted on.

 However, the final Act will not be true to the spirit of the agreement that was sold to the Indian parliament by the government. In effect, India has accepted the provisions contained in all those nuclear treaties that it had opposed up to now as being discriminatory, but outside the framework of those treaties.

 If one examines the two bills in detail, several things become clear. India would first have to sign the agreement on inspections with the International Atomic Energy Agency. Simultaneously, the cartel of Nuclear Suppliers Group would have to take a consensus view on transferring nuclear technology for peaceful purposes to India. And only then the US Congress would decide on allowing American nuclear cooperation with India.

 The Indian insistence on reciprocity and sequencing is now clearly over. New Delhi?s interpretation of equal treatment with other nuclear weapons powers and the acceptance of India?s nuclear weapon status have also come to naught.

 The Indian government had sold the deal by focusing on energy requirements and the need to expand electricity generation using nuclear power plants. This Indian thrust does not find any mention in the proposed legislation. The focus is entirely on non-proliferation.

 The legislation also puts paid to the argument that the nuclear deal is aimed at containing China. The way to do that cannot be by tying India hand and foot. 

 There is no language in the bill of India?s aspiring to or being viewed as a potential great power. The underlying theme seems to be on binding a recalcitrant country ? which has refused to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the Missile Technology Control Regime ? into the constraints of non-proliferation laws.

 The legislation also requires the American president to make an annual report to the Congress on matters purely internal to India. The legislation entails that besides reporting on the previous year?s and the forthcoming year?s exports under the agreement, the president shall also report to the Congress on: ?an estimate for the previous year of the amount of uranium mined in India?; ?the amount of such uranium that is likely to be used or allocated for the production of nuclear explosive devices?; the ?rate of production of material for nuclear explosive devices? as well as of ?nuclear devices?; and finally, an analysis of whether imported uranium has affected the rate of production of nuclear devices.

 The government had said that the decision on setting up future nuclear plants and facilities would be a sovereign one. But the American president is also required to report to Congress on such facilities.

 If the Indo-US nuclear deal has nothing to do with India?s strategic or weapons programme ? as foreign office mandarins never tire of arguing ? then why is the president being asked to report on everything that impinges on it? What has domestic uranium mining and how much of it is being used for strategic purposes got to do with the Indo-US nuclear deal?

 The US president is also expected to report to the Congress annually on the extent to which it has been able to fulfil the policy objectives in south Asia listed in the legislation.

 These include achieving a ?moratorium on production of fissile material for nuclear explosive purposes? by India, Pakistan, and China; concluding and implementing the fissile material cut off treaty of which both the United States of America and India would be signatories; securing India?s participation in Proliferation Security Initiative including interdiction to prevent proliferation; securing India?s ?full and active participation? in US efforts to dissuade, isolate, and, if necessary, ?sanction and contain Iran for its efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction?; and seeking to halt the increase of nuclear weapon arsenals in south Asia and ?to promote their reduction and eventual elimination.?

 These specific policy objectives are not part of the ?Sense of the Congress? but of the ?Statement of Policy? in the House version of the bill.

 On FMCT, there is not only a requirement that India ?actively? work with the US to conclude such a multilateral treaty ?the president has to detail to the Congress the ?description of steps? that India is taking in that direction.

 All this amounts to a Sword of Damocles hanging over India. Now that the Iran issue has also been put in the House bill, the US administration will have an additional pressure point to nudge India in the desired direction.

 One can continue to take the technical plea that all this is not legally binding on New Delhi, but the question is: Does it constrain India politically or not? The relationship between two countries is not based on any legal document. The kind of relationship that India forges with the US would be based on the sense and expectation of the two governments from each other. The US objectives and sense are clear. India?s are not.

 The Senate bill, however, is much more problematic than the House bill. It seeks to put India under a double bind of safeguards ? negotiated not only with the IAEA but a similar set of safeguards negotiated with the US also. It is no longer sufficient for India to accept the verification and inspections processes of the IAEA in its civilian facilities. The US wants a fall-back option of its own, including access to these facilities.

 To this end, the Senate bill has introduced a separate section on ?End Use Monitoring Programme? (Section 107). This provides for a parallel US verification in case the IAEA safeguards fail. The draft legislation says ?In the event the IAEA is unable to implement safeguards as required by an agreement between the United States and India?, they will be replaced by a set of US verification processes ?that conform with IAEA safeguards standards, principles and practices.?

 Clearly, this alternative, fall-back safeguard mechanism would have to be in place simultaneously with the IAEA safeguards. It is not something that can be negotiated later ? once the IAEA fails to implement its safeguards. This shows how little faith Washington reposes in international arrangements. This was not part of any agreement with India at any point of time.

 The Senate bill also seeks an annual report from the president on ?any significant nuclear commerce between India and other countries? that does not meet the standards applied to US nuclear exports. The pressure clearly would be adhered to US laws and not to Russian or French legislation if it were to be significantly different and if India imported nuclear material or technology from either.

 The thrust and approach of the US Congress is very clear ? to island India?s nuclear capability as much as possible, to constrain and, in effect, cap it. That may or may not be a good idea but India should know where this path leads and whether it wants to traverse it.

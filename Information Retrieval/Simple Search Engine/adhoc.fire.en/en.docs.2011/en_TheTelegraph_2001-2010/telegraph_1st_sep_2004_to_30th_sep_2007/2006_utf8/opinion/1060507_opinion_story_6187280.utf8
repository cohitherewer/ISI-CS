 Letters to Editor

 Without parallel

 Sir ? Kaavya Viswanathan, and smart-alecs like her, have maligned literature (?Another secret leaps out at lift-scarred Kaavya?, May 3). Indian writers such as R.K. Narayan and Mulk Raj Anand, still celebrated the world over, never had to borrow sentences from other writers in English. Viswanathan, quite obviously, is not of the same calibre. What, however, is most shocking is that a publisher as well-known as Little, Brown, is partly to blame for the mess too. Its editorial team should have detected the lifts in the pre-publication stages. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arunima Mishra, Cuttack

 Reign of terror

 Sir ? It is shameful that despite clear evidence of torture and harassment, it took so long to arrest Swapan Saha and his accomplices (?CPM vandals arrested?, May 4). What is worse is that they are back, threatening Saraswati Sinha and her children after a quick bail. This kind of political intimidation is not new in a state where Saha?s party has been in power for the past several decades. But this has to stop. Saha should be put behind bars, this time with a non-bailable warrant. He and his men should receive harsh punishment so that such hooliganism is not repeated. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arun Sen, Calcutta

 Sir ? The recent incident ? left vandalism and the party councillor?s obstinacy despite warnings from the authority ? makes one lose faith in the law-and-order system. The officer-in-charge of the Dum Dum police station, where the victims went to lodge a complaint, is said to have initially dismissed the matter ? a mob baying for a family?s blood is apparently normal. Strong disciplinary action should be taken against Swapan Saha and the police officers who indulge him. One doubts if Alimuddin Street is really keen on protecting the rights of the people in this state. It is possible that the reassurance given to the victims by the party?s zonal secretary, Swapan Gupta, is an attempt to avoid a post-election scandal. 

 Yours faithfully,

Avijit Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? What was more deplorable than the actions of Swapan Saha was the inaction of the OC of the Dum Dum police station. Criminals have a way with the police, which is why they manage to spread terror and get away with it. Even if they are arrested, they are promptly bailed out. If the state government allows its partymen to indulge in this kind of terror, West Bengal will once again lose its attraction as a destination for business investments. The helpless and the needy have be given justice for Bengal to progress. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sandip Mitra, Toronto

 Sir ? Why is the Communist Party of India (Marxist) hell-bent on building a club on the land which is legally Saraswati Sinha?s? The ruling party is supposed to preserve the rights of the public. If its members turn lawbreakers then one must say that the system is flawed. The Sinhas have the relevant documents to prove that the land belongs to them. If they did not, the party goons could have easily snatched their land away. This kind of terror is most prevalent in the rural areas where the people do not even have the resources to assert their rights. Now it seems to be a reality in the city as well. It is time to ensure that the Marxists loosen their iron grip on power. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? CPI(M) party bosses must realize that the days of muscle power have ended and to get respect from their electorate they must weed out the criminals from the party immediately. Our law implementing bodies also need a complete overhaul. 

 Yours faithfully,

Diptendu Chakraborty, Toronto

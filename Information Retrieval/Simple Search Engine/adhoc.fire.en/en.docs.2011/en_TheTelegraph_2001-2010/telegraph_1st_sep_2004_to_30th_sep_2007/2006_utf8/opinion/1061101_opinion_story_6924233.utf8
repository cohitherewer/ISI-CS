 Safe territory?

 Sir The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act is good news for women who have suffered at the hands of their husbands or in-laws (Law rein on violence at home, Oct 26). There can be no doubts about the fact that this act is a comprehensive piece of legislation. It includes every possible form of violence that a woman might face. Besides, it extends protection not only to a wife but also to live-in partners, daughters, sisters, mothers and widows. Often, after the husbands death, the wife is asked to leave her marital home and such an act can help safeguard the rights of these women. 

 However, it is not as if this act is perfect. For instance, it will not be effective when a woman is being tortured by other women in the family. Neither does it consider the possibility of women taking advantage of this legislation to harass men. 

 Yours faithfully,

Masood Md. Sohail, Calcutta

 Sir The need for a law that will guard women against domestic abuse has long been felt by both conscientious men and women. Violence like name-calling or slapping women have become routine practice, so much so that they are not considered insulting to the victims at all. Women need to wake up to the reality of what is being done to them by their men. The law should help women become more aware of their rights and lodge complaints when their rights are trampled upon. Today, women in India want to work and earn at par with men. Hence, the provision in the act which specifies that a man cannot prevent his wife from taking up a job or force her to leave it, deserves special applause. 

 Yours faithfully,

Monica Sharma Bajpai, Guwahati

 Sir The law to bar domestic violence may be hailed as a milestone in the path of alleviating the wretched condition of a majority of Indian women. However, the law is heavily tilted in favour of women, and this somehow spoils the chances of according equal status to women in our society. In a sense, the law provides women with a security net, thereby bracketing them as a group that requires protection from a powerful adversary. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Minor altercations are not unusual in any relationship. If a wife goes to court each time her husband hurts her feelings, however unintentionally, then the family as an institution would come to an end. The judges should exercise extreme caution in judging cases filed under the new act. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad 

 Sir It is heartening to note that forced sexual intercourse within a relationship has been introduced into the legal vocabulary of violence by the act passed by the parliament. A large number of women endure sexual abuse within a marriage. They suffer silently in the false belief that their husbands have every right to treat them as they like. The law against marital rape will help protect a womans dignity within a marriage or any heterosexual relationship.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Two significant laws have been enacted in recent times, one banning child labour, and the other, shielding women from domestic violence. Unfortunately, both are half measures, as they do not seem to be concerned with the fate of the victims after they are rescued. In most cases, the offenders are also those who provide the victims with food and shelter. If the women were to complain against them to the police, they would lose their means of sustenance immediately. The purpose of the law cannot be served completely if it does not find ways to support the victims after their release from the tormenters grip.

 Yours faithfully,

C.V.K. Moorthy, Bangalore

 Sir The act implemented by the ministry of women and child development is based on the misconceived notion that men are always the oppressors while the women are the oppressed. This is not true since women can be as abusive or violent as men. The act is a gross violation of the provisions of equality of law and the equal protection of law for all as enshrined in the Constitution. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir The law against domestic violence can be effective only as a deterrent, and not as a solution to family feuds. The victim will be able to take the help of the law only when she is free to break all relations with the culprit. Hardly any woman will wish to see her husband in jail when she has children to support. Moreover, if the accused is acquitted of the charges, will the complainant be able to live with him in the same premises? Cases of domestic violence are social problems and the society has to tackle them with the help of law. Law alone cannot rid the society of all ills.

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

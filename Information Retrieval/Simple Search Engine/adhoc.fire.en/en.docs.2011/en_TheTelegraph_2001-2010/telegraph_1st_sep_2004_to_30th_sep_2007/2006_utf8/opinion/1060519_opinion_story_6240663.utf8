 THUS PARTY 

 Expecting the unexpected from a communist party is nearly as absurd as looking for dawn to break on the western horizon. The functioning of a communist party is established on certain set patterns that almost always replicate themselves. Thus, veteran Alimuddin Street watchers are not a jot surprised by Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s new team of ministers. In a party like the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the seats and the massive margins are garnered by the district leadership and mass front organizations of the party that work assiduously at the local level to keep in touch with the grievances and expectations of the people. In addition, there is the presence of Left Front partners and their demands. This is a world far removed from the sphere and influence of governance operating out of Writers? Buildings. At the time of ministry formation, the districts, the mass fronts and the allies cannot be ignored or left out in the cold. Inevitably thus, ministry formation is based on real political compulsions and is always a product of adjustments, compromises and concessions. It cannot, especially in the case of the Left Front and the CPI(M), be left to the choice of one man, whatever be his personal standing. Mr Bhattacharjee, who has grown up within the communist party, could hardly expect things to be otherwise. His new cabinet shows how powerful and influential the district leadership can be within the CPI(M) at the time of decision-making. The party and the organization have prevailed. This was never in the realm of the unexpected.

 This reaffirmation of the power of the party and the districts has to be seen in a particular context. Mr Bhattacharjee has already made clear his political and economic agenda. He has also won a popular mandate in favour of the agenda. This does not make him independent of the party. Rather, it places upon him the additional responsibility of carrying the party with him. This passage may not always be smooth and easy. Contradictions and conflicts will surface between the government and the party, between the chief minister?s vision and the party?s political praxis. The management and the resolution of such contradictions will be a new challenge.

 Mr Bhattacharjee has one major advantage on his side. His party and the Left Front went to the polls upholding his reformist agenda and projecting his vision of an industrialized West Bengal. In other words, the district leadership of the CPI(M) accepted in broad outline the changed priorities of governance. The party is thus not wholly out of tune with the chief minister?s agenda of an investor-friendly West Bengal. There is only a road forward. The road back is a cul de sac. The district juggernaut, even as it puts its own candidates as ministers, has no other alternative save working to promote the chief minister?s agenda. That is what the party desires.

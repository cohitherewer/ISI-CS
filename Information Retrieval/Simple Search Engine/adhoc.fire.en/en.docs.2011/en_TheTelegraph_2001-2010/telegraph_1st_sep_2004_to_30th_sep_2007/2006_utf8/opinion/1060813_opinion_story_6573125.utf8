 Letters to Editor

 Party pooper

 Sir The report, Party to help draw land map for govt (Aug 8), is the latest proof of how a political party has hijacked the state administration. Since time immemorial, land mapping has been more of a pseudo-scientific convention than a matter of mathematical accuracy. This has given rise to innumerable disputes, which have been routinely exploited by vested interests. The decision to involve a political party in drawing up a land map, detailing agricultural and non-agricultural plots in the state to facilitate land-acquisition by the industry and the promotion of suitable cultivation, is populist rather than administrative.

 Right to defence

 Sir Ashok Mitras hurried analysis of recent events in west Asia portrays just one side of the story (Worst foot forward, Aug 4). The loss of civilian lives in Lebanon is tragic, but we must never forget that the Hizbollah provoked Israel into responding this way by kidnapping two Israeli soldiers. Running a democratic state, one of the primary duties of the government in Tel Aviv, entails protecting its citizens from terrorist threats such as the rockets periodically fired into Israels northern territories. It could be argued that India should take a cue from Israel in such matters, as our soldiers are regularly killed along the borders with rogue neighbours. Moreover, Mitra fails to comprehend the serious differences in the interests of the various Arab states and lumps them together as victims of American imperialism. Not only have Saudi Arabia and Egypt nothing to gain from participating in the Lebanon crisis, but they also have their own domestic problems (radical Wahhabism and the Muslim Brotherhood respectively) to deal with. While criticizing Indias supposed tilt towards the United States of America in its foreign policy approach, Mitra refuses to understand that we have let our interests suffer under the banner of non-alignment for far too long. A state cannot afford to put an outdated ideology ahead of its strategic interests. Even outfits such as Nepals Maoists, Palestines Hamas or Lebanons Hizbollah have their own agenda; they merely hide it behind a faade of concern for their faith or their people.

 Sir The west Asia flare-up calls for an immediate ceasefire, followed by a long-lasting political solution. In particular, Iran has to be censured for fighting this proxy war through the Hizbollah. Whatever Ashok Mitra might feel, Israel was drawn into the present conflict by the Hizbollah. Israel is, after all, a small nation surrounded by hostile neighbours. Besides, contrary to what Mitra alleges, there is nothing wrong with Indias foreign policy since Israel supplies us sophisticated arms that may come to use to give a bloody nose to China or Pakistan.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Ashok Mitra disapproves of the US role in the Lebanon crisis. By the same logic, Israels Arab neighbours too have no business poking their snout in the Israel-Palestine-Hizbollah conflict. Mitra is also wrong in stating that the Jewish community is of crucial importance in a number of key states in American elections. In fact, Jews constitute a mere 2 per cent of the American population, and there are just as many Muslims in the US. 

 As for Jews financing American political parties for the cause of Israel, one could only argue that if Islamic states universally support the Palestinian cause, the Jewish diaspora has every right to stand up for Israel. Mitra and his friends just have to accept Israels right to survive.

 Yours faithfully,

 TO FIND A SHELTER FROM THE STORM

Neha Sahay

 ?I want to buy a house.? This has suddenly become the refrain of 21-year-old Chen Xin. Xin, hailing from a village in Hunan province, has made one of the glittering special economic zones of south China her home for the past five years. Unable now to adjust to life with her mother and her small store back home, she dreams of settling down as a landlady in the city she has come to like, buying her own place in instalments, then renting it out.

 Problem is Xin is only educated up to middle school. Her only jobs have been those of shop assistants and waitresses.

 In her brave sojourn alone in a completely new city, Xin has lived everywhere ? in an attic, a dormitory, her friend?s room, and in her own rented room. The attic came free with the job. But as she moved from family-owned shops into the big bad world of factories and bars, Xin joined the thousands of Chinese for whom home is a noisy dormitory, where baths are shared with half-a-dozen strangers.

 Comfort zone

 Xin decided to try out a room of her own. Rents, she found, varied from 300 to 700 yuan, depending on the location, size and facilities. Sharing a room made sense when the average salary of a shop assistant/ waitress is 700 -1000 yuan.

 The cheapest rooms are located in the poorest sections of the city, in what are still known as ?villages?, made up of dark, garbage-strewn alleys. These rooms come bare, and often, the doors don?t lock. The cold seeps in through the wooden floor through the long winter nights, driving away what little sleep one can get while wondering when a thief will sneak in. Only those female migrants take such rooms who are between jobs, and hence unable to stay on in the dormitory offered by most employers.

 The more expensive rooms come with bed, cupboard and TV, with a shared bath and kitchen across the corridor. The best rooms have these attached.

 Xin has tried them all, and moved upwards over the years. She has managed to buy a few items to make life more comfortable: a pillow, a blanket and a few bed sheets, a pedestal fan, a water dispenser.

 Dreaming big

 Initially, most migrant girls are taken by their more experienced friends around discos and bars. Some never outgrow the addiction. Fortunately, Xin has. ?Last year, going to the disco made my head go ?Ting!?,? she laughs. ?This year, I don?t want to go there at all.? She also refuses to join her friends playing ?poker? in the afternoons, with stakes of 2 yuan. Like all Chinese girls, her obsession with her figure prevents her spending much on food.

 As a result, even after sending money home to her mother, and paying her brother?s school fees (he dropped out after middle school), Xin has managed to save a little fortune: 30,000 yuan. To this she hopes her mother will add the 10,000 yuan she has deposited in the latter?s account.

 A bank balance of 40,000 yuan at 21 ? all of it one?s own savings ? isn?t something to laugh at. Alas, it becomes laughable in the face of Xin?s ambition. Even a small house would cost her five times as much. Repaying the bank loan with interest within a salary of 1,000 yuan ? for it seems unlikely that a middle school migrant worker would ever get paid much more than that ? would take Xin the better part of her life. 

 The freedom she has now, of leaving a job at the drop of a hat, chucking the free dorm for the quiet of her own room, going home for a long New Year holiday secure in the knowledge that if her boss keeps a replacement, she can always get another similar job, will never be hers. But Xin dreams nonetheless.

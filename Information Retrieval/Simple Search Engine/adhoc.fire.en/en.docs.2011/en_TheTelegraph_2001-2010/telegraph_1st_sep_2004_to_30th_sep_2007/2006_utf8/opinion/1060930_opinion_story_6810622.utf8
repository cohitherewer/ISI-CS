 THE GENERAL IN THE LABYRINTH

 Pervez Musharrafs journey from an officer to an army general and finally to the Presidents house in Islamabad has kicked up a series of storms along the way

 Its a story of journeys. There is one into Kargil; and another to the United States. And then theres General Pervez Musharrafs own journey from commando to communicator. And, all put together, the movement has kicked up quite a global tremor. 

 Last week, Pakistan President Musharraf surprised friends and foes quite a bit by literally launching his memoirs at the White House. A day before its formal release, Musharrafs book figured tantalisingly at a press conference that he addressed with US President George Bush. Buy the book, said the American President and In the line of fire promptly shot into Amazon.coms best-sellers list. 

 The book is clearly doing well, but the General, as is his wont, is in the eye of a billowing hurricane. In what can only be described as a kick-and-tell book, Musharraf lauds Pakistan armys landmark performance in the 1999 Kargil conflict with India. And while mentioning the failed 2001 summit between India and Pakistan in Agra, the General writes that both he and the then Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee were humiliated by someone above them. 

 Not surprisingly, the book is the talk of the town. And while its sales graph is shooting up like a gas balloon, not many in Pakistan and India are happy with it. The book is an amalgam of contradictions, as it distorts facts about the state of Musharrafs relationship with former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, the circumstances that led to change of government in 1999, the Kargil crisis and so on, says Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, deputy parliamentary leader of Nawaz Sharifs Pakistan Muslim League. 

 In India, former Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee has refuted Musharrafs observation of the two leaders so-called humiliation. And several defence experts, including former generals, have pooh-poohed his take on Kargil. 

 Look at the man. He is bragging about Kargil seven years after he vehemently denied Pakistans role in it, says Ajai Sahni, the executive director of the New Delhi-based Institute for Conflict Management. General Musharraf is a compulsive and inveterate liar and he has no moral scruples, Sahni says, perhaps uncharitably. 

 Whats evident, though, is the fact that Musharraf continues to set the agenda in the sub-continent. Ever since he usurped power in a coup on October 12, 1999, Musharraf has been hitting the headlines. From his India links he was born in Delhi in August 1943 to the aborted attempts on his life and his so-called battle against terrorists, Musharraf is never out of the news for long. 

 But then, Pallu as he is called in his immediate family has always been a controversial man. His journey from an officer to an army general and finally to the Presidents house in Islamabad has kicked up a series of storms along the way. 

 His childhood, too, saw a spate of journeys. Soon after the family left India, young Musharraf moved to Ankara in Turkey, where his father was on a diplomatic assignment from 1949 to 1956. The boy who spoke fluent Turkish returned to Pakistan to join St Patricks a high school in Karachi whose list of old boys includes one Lal Krishna Advani. The next leg of his journey took him to the Forman Christian College in Lahore and then on to the Pakistan Military Academy. 

 But few really knew that within the man in khaki there lurked a book. Observers in Pakistan believe that Musharraf was egged on to write his memoirs because of the extraordinary international focus on him in the aftermath of 9/11 and the ensuing war on terrorism. And there are some who believe that he is a sharp marketing strategist too his remark about the US threat to bomb Pakistan, they hold, was a calculated move to boost the sales of the book. 

 It worked. The publishers are laughing all the way to the bank, while critics are carefully going through the pages of the book to pick holes in his narration. 

 Musharraf would only be selling a pack of lies if he were trying to justify the Kargil war as a landmark Pakistani success, for it was nothing short of a complete misadventure for them, says one of Indias leading defence experts, major-general (retd) Afsir Karim. They invaded from a route along which they had no logistical support, and their soldiers would have starved to death even if they were left unchallenged by the Indian Army. In fact, they were so impoverished by the end of the war that they left the task of burying their dead to us and fled, he adds. 

 Even back home, where Musharrafs critics are legion, few have anything good to say about the book or the man behind it. Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan describes the writer as a totally egocentric gentleman. And a central leader of Benazir Bhuttos Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Farhatullah Babar, rues that while the book may have boosted Musharrafs financial standing, it had neither served the cause of truth nor the interests of the country. To top it, argues Babar, it had raised the moral and political question whether a sitting army chief and president should take a public position on national policy issues and whether he should spend public funds for promoting his book. 

 Musharrafs cronies have supported the book but the Generals journey as a writer has won some praise from other quarters too. It is being pointed out in Pakistan that the writer does have a liking for Urdu and English literature, and a special penchant for books on international and military affairs. Nasim Zehra, a senior Pakistani political analyst, welcomes the book and brushes aside most of the oppositions criticism. The debate has begun on the issues merely because a head of state has penned them, and obviously others could have a different opinion on some of the issues he has addressed, she holds. 

 The book continues to excite conflicting passions as does the General. Now it remains to be seen whether he walks out of the maze that he has walked into, or goes deeper in.

 WHAT THE PICTURES TEACH

 Uddalak Mukherjee

 How does one talk about sex to a group of young, painfully shy, village girls with little or no education? This was what Himalini Varma kept thinking as she sat inside a tiny hut in a village in South 24 Parganas. Facing her was a group of adolescent girls, who, when asked about the physical changes that took place in a woman?s body, broke out in nervous giggles and put their heads down on their knees. 

 The year was 1996, and Varma, who had specialized in communication design and chosen to work in the social sector, was on a project to promote the concept of reproductive health in a village in West Bengal. She knew that getting young girls in a village to talk about sex, childbirth and contraception was going to be a difficult task. 

 But what compounded Varma?s problem further was the reluctance on the part of the health workers to discuss reproductive health with the girls. Even a matronly health worker like Banidi, who had decades of work experience, had told Varma that she was uncomfortable talking about ?those things? to girls half her age. Clearly, something needed to be done ? something which would not only help the girls, but also the health workers, understand and talk more openly about a woman?s body and its functions. 

 Saying it better

 What the young woman came up with was the ?Champa kit? ? a generic reproductive health kit developed by Thoughtshop Foundation, an NGO specializing in social communication in collaboration with CINI. It comprised five modules, each of them focussing on some aspect of women?s reproductive health. What made this kit unique was its interactive nature. Games and stories were included to facilitate discussions with the target group. There were also charts and picture cards depicting characters and situations from everyday village life that helped the girls understand their bodies better. 

 This tool was designed to help break some preconceived ideas too ? virtuous women were blessed with sons; abortion was an effective method of contraception; menstruation was the release of impure blood in a womans body and so on. The stories, using the fictitious ?Champa? as a protagonist, helped the girls get rid of their flawed views. 

 The kit is simple to use and cheap, two facts that have made this tool appealing to numerous organizations using it at the grassroots. It also provides a crucial link between the strategies developed by experts on reproductive health and their implementation at local levels. 

 A job half done

 About a hundred kits are manufactured at a time, and they are now being extensively used by workers in rural Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Jharkhand, Bihar, Rajasthan and West Bengal. 

 The success of the kit with girls led the organization to develop another one for boys. However, as Varma found out, the needs of boys were very different from those of girls. It was amusing: ?All they wanted to know was the secret to impress the girls in their villages,? says Varma. But once the kit was redesigned, the boys came round and were seen exchanging views on concepts such as fatherhood as well as violence against women. 

 But the job is only half done. Despite the success of the Champa kit, there are areas that need to be addressed. For instance, the kit needs to be marketed properly so that it can have a wider reach. Limited resources have impaired bulk production. The media also needs to do more in order to highlight success stories at local levels. 

 Given the magnitude of the task, the success can be meaningful only if it can be continually built upon. Champa has great potential; she needs a lot of committed friends to see it fulfilled.

 Travels with an empty wallet

Confessions Of an Indian 

Woman Eater (Penguin, Rs 295) by Sasthi Brata is the story 

of a man who leaves home with nine books, a few clothes, and seventy five rupees 

in his pocket to begin his ?journey in life?. He ends up visiting Delhi, London, 

Paris and Italy, taking up odd jobs for survival and returns a wiser soul but 

with his ?thirst? partially quenched despite his adventures with that ?contraband 

comestible? ? woman. The description of Amit?s journey is real, almost touching. 

Sample this scene from a train journey ? ?When the morning came we were in northern 

India. The fields were no longer green but parched and brown... Inside the carriage, 

babies clung to pendulous brown breasts, the men chewed neem twigs... while I 

sat...overlooking this mobile miniature of an India I had never seen before?. 

Sans Moi (Rupa, 

Rs 295) by Marie Desplechin violates one of the central tenets in the 

dictionary of babysitting. Olivia, ?a recovering drug user and sometimes a prostitute? 

is hired to babysit Thomas and Suzanne. But in the course of time, she develops 

a bond with the children and their mother ? a relationship that is intimate and 

characterized by mutual respect. Desplechin?s work explores the various layers 

present in human relationships, and ends up breaking a few myths about them with 

a gentle yet mischievous touch. 

M.V. Kamath: A Journalist 

at Large (Jaico, Rs 275) compiled by Kalindi Randeri brings 

together the experiences of a quintessential hack. Kamath has met many characters 

in the course of a long and illustrious career, and these meetings have resulted 

in this collection of engaging anecdotes.

Confronting Saffron Demography 

(Three Essays, Rs 200) by Patricia and Roger Jeffery falls 

back on twenty solid years of field research in the rural areas of Uttar Pradesh 

to bust some of the negative stereotypes about Indian Muslims. The findings clearly 

indicate that the idea of Muslims as a ?backward? community often stems from organized 

attempts to compound the differences between the two communities and keep them 

divided. This is an important book and comes at a time when blaming Muslims for 

the country?s ills has become quite fashionable. However, the essays could have 

had a wider reach had it been written in a less pedantic manner.

 RIGHT TO KNOW

 The guarding of secrets is one of the main preoccupations of power. In the public realm, such secrets are often the result of custom rather than being sanctioned by law. In a competitive and bureaucratic society like India, authorities conducting public examinations often have very high stakes in not disclosing their procedures of evaluation and election, making room for a range of injustices and malpractices that the public can only guess at and suffer. It is this essentially anti-democratic ethos that the Right to Information Act seeks to undo, putting in its place standards and practices of transparency and accountability that can revolutionize the relations between citizens, bureaucrats and politicians. The latest battle for the implementation of this act is being fought between the Central Information Commission and the Union Public Service Commission. The former has directed the latter to disclose all details of its examinations. This includes everything from the identity of examiners to methods of moderation. There were over 2,000 appeals to the UPSC seeking to see copies of answer sheets, and the CICs directive cuts through the legal wrangling that the UPSC had managed to keep up in order to defer the disclosure of information.

 The most revealing fact about the UPSCs knee-jerk unwillingness to be transparent is the fact that it kept changing the reasons for not disclosing the required details. These reasons varied from concern about the smooth running of the examination process to fears for the safety of the evaluators. Many of the alarming amendments to the RTI Act that the Centre had been pondering had to do with excluding from scrutiny information concerning public examinations, including those conducted by postal and railways departments, for instance, apart from IIT and IAS entrance tests. The vetoing of these amendments now ensures a greater degree of fairness in these matters. Some months ago in Kerala, a postwoman and a railways superintendent had individually tried to use the RTI Act to appeal to see the scripts of their departmental examinations for selection and for promotion. The information commissioner had then rejected both their appeals on the grounds that such scrutiny would cause unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the individual. The CICs latest stand on the UPSC situation shows an entirely welcome change of attitude.

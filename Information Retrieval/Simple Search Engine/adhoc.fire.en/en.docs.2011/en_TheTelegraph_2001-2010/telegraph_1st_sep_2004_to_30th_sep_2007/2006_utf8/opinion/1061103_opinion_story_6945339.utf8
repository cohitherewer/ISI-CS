 HEED THE RULES, WIN THE GAME

 SATRUJIT BANERJEE

 For India Inc., it is another confirmation that the country has arrived on the global stage. And the numbers are mindboggling. Tata Steel UK Limited, a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Tata Steel, has offered to buy out Corus Group Plc for $7.6 billion in cash, which works out to around Rs 35,000 crores. To put it in perspective, the total value of all Indian mergers and acquisitions for 2005 is $4.3 billion. But it is not only the size of the deal which is of interest to the Indian business community. The temerity with which Tata Steel, a minor player in the international arena, suddenly took the steel world by storm with its offer to buy out a blue chip steel-maker of the first world, and in the process tried to become the fifth largest steel-maker in the world, is a story in itself. 

 When a company buys out another, around three times its size as is the case with Tata-Corus the modus operandi is a leveraged buyout. In this procedure, the acquirer typically floats a special purpose vehicle overseas, chips in about a third of the total money required and borrows the rest. The company being taken over becomes a subsidiary of the SPV. Later, the SPV or the holding company can be merged with the company being acquired. What makes LBOs so popular is that the cash flow or profits of the company being acquired can be used to pay off the debts. If the company being acquired becomes bankrupt, the acquirer does not bear any liability. It is for this reason that lending banks single out financially sound and reputed companies to finance their LBOs. Needless to say, the merchant banker who facilitates the acquisition, arranges the loan for the buyout and, more often than not, acts as the lead banker, charging a pretty penny. A fee upward of $200 million is known to have been charged for deals less than half that of the Tata-Corus one.

 Unequal players

 The irony of all this is that Indian banks cannot finance a LBO, even if the acquirer is an Indian company. The laws of our country require our banks to take, at least on paper, a call on the acquirer, its financials and cash flow. In other words, Indian banks can lend for acquisition but not lend against the assets of the company being acquired. It thus makes it practically impossible for an Indian company to acquire another double or triple its size and use Indian merchant bankers. While very few in India will feel the need to canvas for amending banking laws to allow LBOs, fewer still will want a level playing field when it comes to a foreign company taking over an Indian blue chip. 

 What if we wake up one morning and find an upstart Silicon Valley software company making an above market-price offer to buyout our beloved Infosys ? Or a General Electric bidding for Reliance Industries ? No, these cannot happen as the laws of the land forbid it. But the same laws do not forbid Indian companies buying up blue chip companies overseas. Moreover, we have cunningly shielded our real navaratnas, those grossly undervalued government companies merrily operating in the international arena without any fear of a takeover, hostile or otherwise. This, for you, is the Hindu definition of a level playing field.

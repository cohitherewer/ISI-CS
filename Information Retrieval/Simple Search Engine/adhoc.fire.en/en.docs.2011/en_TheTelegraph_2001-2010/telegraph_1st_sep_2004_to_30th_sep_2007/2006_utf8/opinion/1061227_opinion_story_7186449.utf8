 TORN PAPER

 For some time now Mr Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the president of Iran, has been specializing in high-strung rhetoric. Thus, his debunking of the United Nations sanctions passed unanimously despite days of dithering and secret parleys on Irans trade in fissile material and technology as a piece of torn paper should have caused no surprise. Like his previous statements, it was designed for maximum impact both at home and abroad. And there is little reason to suspect that he has failed. The muscle-flexing, in fact, appears to be perfectly timed for Iran, where Mr Ahmadinejad has found himself trounced in the recent elections to the local councils and to an important clerical body. The nuclear issue may again help deflect attention from his governments inefficiency and authoritarian ways. For the international community, though, such defiance has always spelt trouble. In Irans case, unlike in North Koreas, it may even find itself in a double bind. Russias interests in Iran (it has heavily invested in a new nuclear reactor in Bushehr) and Chinas dependence on it for oil imports have already been restraining factors in the negotiations. The two, having delayed the imposition of sanctions, will continue trying to dissuade the United States of America and its allies from the use of force. Mr Ahmadinejad understands these compulsions only too well, as he does the USs. He realizes that with such severe losses in Iraq and with the Shiite coalition gaining in strength there, the US will be in no position to push things too hard on Iran. 

 The only way ahead for the international community is a composite dialogue. Ironically, this should be the same for Mr Ahmadinejad as he cannot, in his right mind, dismiss an adverse domestic fallout of the incessant warmongering. Also, Irans sympathizers can hardly write off a nuclear threat if it gets too real. That holds for India as well, although as an independent nation enjoying a nuclear status, India cannot be questioned if it chooses to support Irans pursuance of a peaceful nuclear programme. Iran has always pointed at Israels nuclear capabilities to justify garnering its own. Such circumlocutory logic can serve Mr Ahmadinejads self-interests, but never Irans own. The nation is a signatory to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, and it cannot run away from its obligations, unless it seeks to play its cards as badly as North Korea.

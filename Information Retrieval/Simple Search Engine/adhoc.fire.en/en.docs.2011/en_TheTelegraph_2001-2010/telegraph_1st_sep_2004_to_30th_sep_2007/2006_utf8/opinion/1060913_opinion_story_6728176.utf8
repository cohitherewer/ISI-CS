 Rethinking the myth 

 Sir One heartily agrees with what Sumanta Sen has to say about Suchitra Sen in A legend in the shadows (Sept 6). The Bengali infatuation with Mrs Sen has to do a lot with their idiosyncrasies. As a schoolgirl who skipped classes to catch a glimpse of the diva on the silver screen, I can vouch for that.

 However, before dismissing Suchitra Sen as one with much charisma but debatable talent, one should consider the Fifties socio-cultural milieu in which she achieved fame. For men, association with women, whether real or celluloid, was rare in those days. Women still did not work for a living, and so they were not as readily seen on the streets as they are today. Sen, with her glamour and sophistication, became the dream woman for the middle class Bengali male. And after she had become an icon, questions of her acting abilities did not arise. As Sumanta Sen rightly points out, there were artistes better than Sen. It is also possible that the Prosenjit-Rituparna duo is today a bigger money-spinner than the Uttam-Suchitra team. But in the Bengali psyche, the latter will remain irreplaceable. By proposing to honour Sen with the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, the information and broadcasting minister, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, is trying to tickle this Bengali sentiment. 

 Yours faithfully,

Chameli Pal, Batanagar

 Sir Sumanta Sen argues that Kanan Bala is more deserving of the Dadasaheb Phalke Award than Suchitra Sen because the former had helped Bengali cinema find its feet. In this context, one would be advised to read Kanan Balas autobiography, Sabare Ami Nami, where she mentions Sens contribution towards the betterment of the working conditions of Bengali actresses. Sen added respectability to the profession at a time when actresses were looked down upon and not taken seriously. Instead of accusing her of throwing star tantrums, one should realize that Sens refusal to compromise helped raise the status of female actors. Through her films, Sen endowed the image of the Bengali woman with a rare assertiveness. In both her personal and professional life she is a non-conformist, which is one reason why she continues to be misunderstood.

 There were other actresses of calibre during Sens time. They flourished in their own niches and can never be considered her substitute. Sens combination of sensuousness, sensitivity, innocence and poise was rare in Bengali cinema. She continued to be the rage even when the audience had the option of watching Meena Kumari, Madhubala and Waheeda Rehman in Hindi movies. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sucharita Mitra, Calcutta

 Sir Suchitra Sen proved to be a very reliable stake for Bengali film producers for a decade or so in the middle of the previous century. Her very name was enough to set the box office on fire. But one cannot associate brilliance or talent with her. Probably Sen did not really need to act in quality movies to prove her worth because the iconic status she enjoyed in Bengal was enough for her. 

 Yours faithfully,

Saptarshi Das, Calcutta

 Sir It seems that Sumanta Sen did not care to do much homework before writing on Suchitra Sen. Can one erase her name from the list of all time greats after considering her performance in Sat Pake Bandha and Dip Jele Jai? These are two films in which Sen did not share the screen space with Uttam Kumar. But she excelled in two different types of roles in two very different kind of films.

 Yours faithfully,

Sujit De, Sodepur 

 Sir Today it is difficult to understand why a generation of Bengalis almost blindly adored every film featuring Uttam Kumar and Suchitra Sen. It seems that the appeal of those films lay in the middle class sentiments they portrayed, rather than in any exceptional acting skills. One would agree with Sumanta Sen that talented Bengali directors like Ritwik Ghatak deserve to be awarded, even if posthumously, rather than Suchitra Sen.

 Yours faithfully,

Indranil Samanta, Calcutta

 Sir Sumanta Sen has grossly underestimated Suchitra Sens contribution to the world of Bengali cinema. There was a time when film directors used to swear by her name because of her unmatched acting skills. Even recently, a Uttam-Suchitra retrospective attracted a huge crowd of people of all ages. That could not have been the case if Sen had no capability as an actor. 

 Yours faithfully,

P.K. Das Bhaumik, Calcutta 

 Sir Does a persons physical presence at the award ceremony determine whether he or she should be conferred the honour? If Suchitra Sen is being considered for an award, then the selection committee must make its decision on the basis of her contribution to Indian cinema. Why should the issue be whether she will agree to receive it and thus expose herself to the public glare? Sen has chosen to be a recluse. It is a personal decision that needs to be respected. Jean Paul Sartre had refused the Nobel Prize in 1964. But the deciding committee, having selected Sartre, did not give away the award to someone else because of his refusal.

 In a pre-globalized India, Sen almost single-handedly came to represent the accomplished middle class Bengali woman. Her appeal is akin to that of Greta Garbo, Ava Gardener and Elizabeth Taylor.

 Yours faithfully,

Shombit Sengupta, Calcutta

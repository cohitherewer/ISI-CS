The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 ON RECORD

 The judiciary, by itself, cannot protect women and children from marriage or its abusive consequences. Yet, the failures of the administration throughout the country often result in gender justice being identified with judicial activism. This is what the Supreme Court?s ruling that all marriages must be registered might look like to critics of such activism. But this is a crucial first step on two counts. First, based on a draft prepared by the National Commission for Women, the court?s ruling would lay the foundations for more effective interventions, legal and otherwise, against child marriage and a whole range of injustices against married and widowed women. Second, the firm and comprehensive nature of the ruling, bringing all religions within its purview, looks like an important advance towards uniformity. The details of the ruling would spell out the exact nature of the mandatoriness imposed by the court, for that would determine, to a very great extent, how effective, in actual terms, such a ruling would be. It underlines, all the more starkly, the importance of enforcement, and the need for the states, among them West Bengal, to be immensely more efficient and vigilant about enforcement and the infrastructure necessary to ensure this.

 Low registration is a problem in rural as well as urban India in different ways, leading to different social and legal problems. Most child marriages take place in areas and in communities where registry offices are hard to come by. Here, the idea of registering births, deaths and marriages are beyond the pale of popular thinking, and police as well as community vigilance regarding gender injustice extremely slack. In cities like Calcutta, as the West Bengal Legal Aid Services had found out a few years ago, a low level of marriage registration has made it difficult for a significant number of married women to annul their unregistered marriages in spite of suffering from domestic violence. Ultimately, a ruling like this becomes effective if supported by augmented infrastructure and active enforcement. And that would depend on the priorities of the law-enforcers, with the welfare and rights of women and children being currently almost invisible at the very bottom of the list. If the court?s ruling jogs the administration out of this passivity, it would mark an important step towards social change.

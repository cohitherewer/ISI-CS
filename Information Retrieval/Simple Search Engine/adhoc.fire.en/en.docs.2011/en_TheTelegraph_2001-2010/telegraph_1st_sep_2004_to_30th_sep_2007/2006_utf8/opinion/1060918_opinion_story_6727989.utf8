 LEARNING FROM A NEIGHBOUR 

 Chinese oil security policies hold 

 certain instructive lessons for other countries, including 

 India, writes Chandrashekhar Dasgupta.

 On firm ground 

 Chinas spectacular economic growth 

 has resulted in a sharp rise in its oil consumption. Until 

 1993, China was a net exporter of petroleum products. Today, 

 it is the worlds second largest importer. Sustained development 

 of the Chinese economy will inevitably entail increasing 

 dependence on petroleum imports in the coming years. A sharp 

 or sudden disruption in the flow of oil imports can precipitate 

 a major economic reversal. Beijing, therefore, pursues a 

 set of strategic policies designed to minimize the risks 

 of a sudden disruption in the flow of oil imports. These 

 deserve careful study, since our dependence on oil imports 

 is even greater than Chinas. 

 A disruption in oil supplies can 

 be caused by a number of possible political developments. 

 The Gulf countries, which contain the worlds largest oil 

 reserves, lie in a conflict prone region. This is true also 

 of many African and Caspian oil-producing countries. War 

 or civil strife in an important oil-producing country could 

 lead to a shortfall of supplies in the international market. 

 Sanctions or embargoes against such countries would have 

 similar consequences as Iran tirelessly points out these 

 days. A blockade or embargo could also be imposed against 

 an oil-importing country.

 Though it seems to be a very unlikely 

 contingency, Chinese analysts do not rule out the possibility 

 of a blockade if a confrontation were to occur with the 

 United States of America over Taiwan. Since the US navy 

 dominates the worlds oceans, some non-official Chinese 

 analysts have speculated about the possibility of American 

 interference with China-bound oil tankers.

 In order to reduce the risks associated 

 with war or domestic conflict in a producer country, China 

 has diversified the sources from which it imports petroleum. 

 The trend has been strongly marked since the Iraq War, which 

 served as a forceful reminder of the unstable political 

 conditions in the Gulf region. China has turned to Africa, 

 Russia, central Asia and, more recently, Latin America for 

 oil supplies, so as to reduce the extent of its dependence 

 on the Gulf region. China has important stakes in oilfields 

 in Sudan and Angola. Its imports from central Asia are poised 

 to increase sharply, following completion of the construction 

 of a pipeline from Kazakhstan to China. In August, a major 

 oil deal was concluded with Venezuela during president Hu 

 Jintaos visit.

 Chinas quest for new sources 

 of petroleum has been backed up by a diplomatic drive to 

 cultivate closer ties with the new suppliers. During Chinas 

 diversification drive in 2003, President Hu Jintao visited 

 Algeria, Egypt and Gabon, while Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, 

 accompanied by senior Chinese oil executives, toured several 

 other African oil-producing countries. Aid projects have 

 been offered in African countries as part of an oil deal 

 package. The Venezuelan oil deal was accompanied by an exchange 

 of state visits at the highest level. China had close ties 

 with Russia and Kazakhstan even before the oil connection, 

 but the trade in petroleum and natural gas has certainly 

 raised the levels of mutual interdependence between China 

 and these countries.

 Chinese analysts have pointed 

 out that oil delivered through overland pipelines from central 

 Asia and Russia are not subject to the risk of interference 

 from the US navy, unlike oil imported by sea. This may partly 

 explain Chinas readiness to make huge investments in transborder 

 oil pipelines and its high bids for a stake in Kazakhstans 

 oil industry. Western observers believe that the Sino-Kazakhstan 

 pipeline cannot be justified on purely economic grounds. 

 Energy security concerns appear to have played a part in 

 the decision.

 After the oil shock of 1973, the 

 major western powers decided to create emergency oil reserves 

 to cope with shortages during a crisis. The buffer covers 

 requirements for three months. The merits of adopting a 

 similar strategy were debated at length in China during 

 the earlier part of this decade. The benefits in terms of 

 energy security had to be weighed against the very high 

 costs of creating and maintaining a strategic oil reserve.

 China initially seemed to have 

 settled for a modest buffer covering its requirement for 

 no more than one month. Last year, however, China commenced 

 work on a three-stage project to build a larger strategic 

 reserve which, when completed, would see it through an emergency 

 lasting up to three months.

 China has acted vigorously to 

 acquire a significant equity stake in overseas oilfields. 

 The more spectacular initiatives of its oil companies include 

 the contract for developing the Yadavaran oilfield in Iran, 

 acquisition of a majority stake in the Kazakh gas company, 

 Aktobemunaigaz, and its major role in Sudans Greater Nile 

 Petroleum Operating Company. The logic of these acquisitions 

 is often questioned by western analysts, who argue that 

 petroleum is a fungible commodity which can be freely bought 

 by any party prepared to pay the prevailing price. An equity 

 stake in an oilfield is not required for buying petroleum. 

 In the view of these analysts, investment decisions on equity 

 oil should be guided exclusively by profitability calculations. 

 Chinese analysts, however, maintain that an equity stake 

 enables a country to effectively lock in the price of oil 

 during the productive life of the oilfield and to thus insure 

 it against future price increases. The drive to buy into 

 overseas oilfields is an essential component of Beijings 

 energy security strategy.

 Do Chinese oil security policies 

 hold any lessons for us? India and China face similar but 

 not identical oil security problems. The problems are essentially 

 similar since both countries are heavily and increasingly 

 dependent on petroleum imports. Indeed, in Indias case, 

 imports account for an even larger share of consumption. 

 The main dissimilarity is that, compared to China, we are 

 comfortable with the US presence in Asia. The ghosts of 

 1971 have been laid to rest. We do not see eye to eye with 

 the US on many issues but, on the whole, we view it as a 

 benign presence in our neighbourhood, not as a potential 

 adversary.

 Like China, we have tried to reduce 

 our heavy dependence on the Gulf by diversification to other 

 regions, principally Africa. Nigeria has become the second 

 largest supplier of oil to India. Unlike China, our search 

 has been mainly confined to Asia and Africa; we have not 

 ventured as far afield as Latin America or Canada.

 The close coordination of Chinas 

 oil policy with its foreign policy is also instructive. 

 The importance of major oil-producing countries is, of course, 

 duly reflected in our foreign policy, but the petroleum 

 ministry and our oil companies might benefit from closer 

 interaction with the foreign policy establishment.

 India and China follow different 

 investment objectives in seeking stakes in overseas oilfields. 

 Our objectives are strictly commercial; investments decisions 

 are guided by profitability considerations alone. The Planning 

 Commission dismisses the idea that equity oil can serve 

 energy security objectives, maintaining that oil is freely 

 traded like any other commodity and can bought in any quantity 

 at any time by a country possessing the required financial 

 resources. A wider debate is required on this question.

 It is a historical fact that the 

 global production and distribution of oil have frequently 

 been influenced by high politics. We cannot assume that 

 the market mechanism will function normally in a crisis 

 situation. Moreover, oil equity can provide a sort of insurance 

 cover against rising prices since it generates revenues 

 that rise in more or less the same proportion as the prices. 

 The question is more complex than is suggested by the Planning 

 Commission and calls for further study.

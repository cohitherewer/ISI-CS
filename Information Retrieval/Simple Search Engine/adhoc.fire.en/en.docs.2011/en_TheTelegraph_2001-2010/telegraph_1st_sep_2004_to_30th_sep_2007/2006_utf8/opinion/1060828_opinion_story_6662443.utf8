The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 STREET FUN

 Drama and fisticuffs are no longer new or shocking in the Indian parliament. The members of parliament are, in conduct and in desires, lambent in their simplicity. They were the picture of angelic harmony when an increase in their pay was being agreed upon last week. The moment that was over, it was time to play different games. Mr Sadhu Yadav of the Rashtriya Janata Dal and Mr Prabhunath Singh of the Janata Dal (United) quickly fell to a game that boys love best trying to beat each other up. Mr Yadav had his loyalties to exhibit, being not just an RJD MP but also the brother-in-law of Mr Lalu Prasad. Mr Singh had dared to insult Mr Prasad by apparently making snide remarks about the political capital he had made out of a recent incident of rape of Dalit women. The simplicity of accusation and reaction may be deeply affecting, but the manner of expression on both sides was more suitable for the streets. There was also a strain of lurid drama: as both MPs shook their fists and abused each other, they were held back by their colleagues, then another MP banged the speaker box on the table, the staff ran around removing potential missiles out of the MPs way they have been known to throw slippers and microphones, Mr Prasad apologized and Mr Singh offered a hurt resignation. 

 Entertainment channels on television are no match. Only it is a pity that the entertainment the MPs provide is a bitter one. Their behaviour represents not only a decline in decorum, but also a total incomprehension of or arrogant indifference to the role the country has given them. The deepening of democracy does mean a diversity of representation, but it need not mean the abandonment of all sense of history and of place, or a rejection of dignity, rationality and self-respect. But wasting public money with disruptions, fights and adjournments has become a habit. The MPs were happy with their own pay; the buffoonery was the bonus.

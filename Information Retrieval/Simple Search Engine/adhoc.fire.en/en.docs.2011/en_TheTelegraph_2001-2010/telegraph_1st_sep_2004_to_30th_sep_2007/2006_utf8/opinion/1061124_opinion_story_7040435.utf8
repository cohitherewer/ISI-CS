The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Bring on the new wave 

 BONA FIDE / Malvika Singh

 If you look at the many initiatives taken by the United Progressive Alliance that will make a difference to life outside of the middle-class metros, the Congress seems to have had an agenda that is clear and unwavering in its policies, ones they have worked on with diligence, in a concerted effort to make a substantial impact at the polls, starting with the elections in Uttar Pradesh. Rahul Gandhi is described by the Indian press and urban chatterati as nondescript, disconnected with the reality and political difficulties of the most populous and unruly state that dominates Indian politics. The talk around us sounds akin to the endless pontificating we heard in the same public domain during the India Shining period! How wrong the lot were about the result. And, how disillusioned they have been about that result since it hit them in the face.

 Once again reportage is happening through the warped and strange prism of Delhi and other metropolitan cities from where editorials are spewed out. The truth is that no one who does not work in the social and political sector in the rural countryside, has an idea of what is churning there. What are the issues that a new generation voter wants addressed? Have they had their fill of exploitative and corrupt practices? Will they tolerate the baggage of past operations? Will they allow caste to overwhelm their economic space and therefore their future? Will women rebel at the hustings, defy the collective voting decision and help initiate a fresh path? Will the post-independent generation reject badland politics in the hope of a civilized tomorrow? These are some of the obvious questions that need to be asked and solutions sought. Dipstick polls to sense the mood of the electorate should be conducted by the Congress, following which innovative manifestos and campaign slogans can be put together that are energetic and outside of the predictable UP-Congress menu of decades.

 Averse to change

 Reports from those who traverse the countryside with their eyes and ears open speak of a change happening a something that is not identifiable, that is being held secret only because no one has wanted to delve into the reality, and deal with the many truths that such a survey or study is bound to throw up. Lethargy dominates the scene as the older, more irrelevant set of political players in UP and elsewhere, work desperately hard to keep the status quo. Of course, such experienced players will want the machinery to mark time as they grab the spoils knowing well their fortunes. They are fiercely possessive about their fiefdoms, unwilling to let go and pass the baton for good or for bad. They are detrimental to change and are stalling Indias move forward as a world power.

 The domestic violence bill and the womens reservation bill, if passed in the Lok Sabha, will help the UPA and particularly the Congress, to secure the support of nearly 50 percent of the voters, women, in the forthcoming elections in UP and finally, across the country, in the national elections two and a half years from now. The Congress, if it nurtures and does well for this strong constituency, one that is the repository of tradition, culture and social mores, will have been responsible for pulling Bharat out of the stagnation of centuries of male and babu domination. We could rapidly move into the avatar of a modern republic with a young and intellectually vibrant population with human skills and resources unmatched worldwide. 

 If the Congress, as an experiment, puts aside the old and infirm, the predictable and dull, as well as the middle-aged political aspirants who believe they have not had their day in the sun because the ancients hung on to their chairs for dear life, the texture of politics, governance and achievement could undergo a radical change virtually immediately.

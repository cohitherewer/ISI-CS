 Deepening the wounds

 Sir The Malegaon blasts show how vulnerable India is to such assaults (Explosion in prayer crowd, Sept 9). It has suffered more terrorist strikes in recent times than most other countries. Those at the forefront in the war against terrorism have minimized such terrorist strikes, perhaps because they have been able to meet the high cost of security. This is beyond the means of a poor and populous country like India. Which is all the better for terrorists, who cash in on the panic that spreads with each deadly explosion they set off. Given that all religious congregations are likely to become future targets of terror attacks, these should be scaled down by the respective leaders of each community in order to limit the threat to life and property. Human life is more precious than religious rituals.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir The heavy casualties in Malegaon, particularly among the children, show the terrorists heartless attempts to create communal disharmony in the country. Malegaon is mostly inhabited by Muslims and has a history of communal discord. This time, the attacks were calculated to prompt Muslims to believe that anti-Islamic forces are behind the disaster. The basic aim of the terrorists, as that of Indias former colonizers, is to divide and rule. It is important for Indians not to start distrusting their fellow citizens. Any kind of organized violence should not instigate us to fight amongst ourselves. 

 Yours faithfully,

Soumya Mukherjee, Naihati

 Sir Each time there is a terror strike in the country, fingers are pointed at the Students Islamic Movement of India, al Qaida and Lashkar-e-Toiba, presumably to cover up intelligence failure. The state authorities and the media swing into action to point out links with these organizations. It happened once again after Malegaon. Yet, these groups could not have targeted their brethren, that too inside a mosque on an auspicious day. In this context, the possible involvement of other fundamentalist organizations like the Shiv Sena, Vishwa Hindu Parishad and Bajrang Dal should be investigated. Instead of targeting only the usual mischief-makers, the government should explore all possibilities. 

 Yours faithfully,

Md. Ayub Ansari, Jagatdal

 Sir Quite evidently, terrorists are aiming at soft targets overcrowded trains, tourist buses, temples and mosques so that there is maximum casualty, widespread terror and above all, more communal strife. It is strange that the police are not being able to make much headway, despite their wide network of informers. The Union home minister, Shivraj Patil, and the chief minister of Maharashtra, Vilasrao Deshmukh, have failed to convince people that justice will be done. The terror strikes still continue at regular intervals, and the government can only react to such attacks as it fails to prevent them. A mere condemnation of the violence will not serve any good. India should strike back so that it is not victimized anymore. 

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir The Malegaon blasts have added a twist to the phenomenon of terrorism. They have shown that killers do not practice any particular religion. These criminals seem to be having a free run in Maharashtra. They also seem to have found a safe sanctuary in a neighbouring country. Rather than trying to pacify the people, the prime minister should take a more strident stand with respect to Pakistan. And instead of blaming a single community for the attacks, investigators and citizens should view the situation with an open mind. One should not reproach the government alone. The public also needs to be more alert. More unity among the people will help counter these acts. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sukanta Das, Calcutta

 Sir The reports, Fathers carry sons to the grave and Sonias lakh invites 10-lakh bombshell (Sept 10), brought to light the irony of Shab-e-Barat, as victims families returned to the same graveyard they had prayed a while ago to bury the dead. They also expose the governments weak and half-hearted response to the situation. Sonia Gandhi got a fitting reply from Shafiq Ahmad, the father of one of the youths who died in the blasts, when she offered him compensation. Ahmad offered her ten times the compensation if the authorities captured the terrorists within 24 hours. 

 Any reassurance and sympathy will ring hollow if our leaders fail to stop this killing spree and allow the police to hide their failure by staging fake encounters.

 Yours faithfully,

T.R. Anand, Calcutta

 Sir In a shameless rerun of the Mumbai blasts episode, politicians streamed into Malegaon, parroting promises and doling out cheques for the kin of those who died. The person who held centrestage was Sonia Gandhi, who, scoring above her political opponents, managed to reach the town to distribute the compensation. The new strikes add salt to the wounds that the Mumbai blasts created. They once again show the indifference of the administration. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

 Sir One would like to know how many people were dragged out of their homes and humiliated by the lawkeepers in the name of carrying out interrogations following the Malegaon blasts.

 Yours faithfully,

Md. Irfan Ahmad, Calcutta

 Sir The bias against Muslims resurfaced when Rs 1 lakh was announced as compensation for the Malegaon victims. Those who died in the Mumbai blasts were given Rs 5 lakh as compensation. The media coverage of Malegaon was also low-key in comparison. Perhaps the investigations can also be expected to be tardy. If the authorities discriminate even among the dead, the disparity will further disillusion the present generation of Muslims and alienate them from the mainstream. Such step-motherly treatment is unexpected from a secular government.

 Yours faithfully,

Shabana, Chennai

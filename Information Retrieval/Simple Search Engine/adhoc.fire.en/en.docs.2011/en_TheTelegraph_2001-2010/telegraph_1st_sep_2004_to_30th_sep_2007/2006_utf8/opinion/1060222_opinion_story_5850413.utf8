 Letters to Editor

 In all sincerity

 Sir ? Aveek Sarkar has done a wonderful job taking us through a forgotten and forbidden part of the world, and letting us know not only about the historical and mythological importance of Hinglaj but also the political importance of the visit by Jaswant Singh and his team (?In the forbidden zone, face to face with an almost-forgotten goddess?, Feb 12). Let us judge the visit keeping in mind the larger context and not the immediate advantages that may accrue to Singh and his son. Had the visit been guided merely by such petty concerns, the Manmohan Singh government would not have asked the Pakistan government to make the necessary arrangements for the trip. It is now clear that Hindu and Sikh shrines in an Islamic country like Pakistan are as safe as they are in India. There may be a few exceptions, like the Babri Masjid which was demolished here. 

 But why didn?t Jaswant Singh try to visit Hinglaj before, when relations with the Pervez Musharraf government were at the peak during the Vajpayee regime? Was the visit arranged to send a strong message to hardcore Hindu elements that Indians would have to respect Muslim religious feelings in the same way Pakistanis are respecting Hindu and Sikh shrines and sentiments? In this context, we should keep in mind the fact that Manmohan Singh is supposed to participate in a Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee function in Pakistan sometime in June. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir ? I must congratulate Aveek Sarkar for his article on the pilgrimage to Hinglaj in Baluchistan. Having seen the black-and-white Marutirtha Hinglaj, with Uttam Kumar in the lead role, more than 30 years ago, I was always curious to know whether Hinglaj is a myth or a reality. Sarkar?s article also took me back to my post-graduate classes on the early Sassanian empire. Herodotus?s account of Darius talks about the vast extent of the Persian empire, which included India (the Greek name for that region). The regions of Baluchistan also fell under the domain of Darius who allowed the king of that region known as Gedrosia (present day Gwadar), to rule his kingdom undisturbed in exchange for an annual tribute in gold.

 Sir ? Aveek Sarkar?s otherwise immensely readable article on the voyage to Hinglaj was marred by the author?s repeated presentation as irrefutable facts what are at best popular theories about the evolution of Hinduism. For example, while there would be numerous takers for his assertion that Buddha?s induction into the Hindu pantheon was a conscious act of assimilation by clever Aryans, this can also be explained by way of the typical Indian attempt to see a manifestation of the divine in any human being who is revered by the society. It is not always a good idea to attribute ulterior motives to Hinduism. Also, mentioning the name of the Bengali movie would have been appreciated by non-Bengali-speakers. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? One wishes Aveek Sarkar gave more details of the journey than dwelling heavily on the politics (past and present) associated with the region and the shrine. To the best of my knowledge, amongst the 51 pithas, Hinglaj is next only to Kamakshya in importance. 

 Sarkar?s statement that Hinglaj originally was one of the tribal goddesses whom the immigrant Aryans brought into their own pantheon of gods and goddesses with a view to absorb the native tribal people into their milieu requires further examination. Firstly, the Aryans and their Vedas did not recognize any of the customary gods that we now worship. Practically all these gods sprang from the Puranas many centuries later. And inviting some of the tribal gods to sit amongst these later gods took place many more centuries after that. Besides, after their invasion beyond Hindu Kush , the Aryans for many centuries tried hard to maintain the purity of their blood by restricting all social contact with the aborigines and their demon-gods, as is evident from the Rig Veda. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Aveek Sarkar?s Hinglaj odyssey made for an excellent read. Thanks to Avadhuta?s brilliant novel and Bikash Roy?s equally brilliant film based on it, Bengalis are well-acquainted with the Baluchistan pitha and the arduous journey that used to be undertaken by pilgrims. But with the opening up of Delhi-Lahore, Srinagar-Muzaffarabad bus services, the railway link through Munaba in Rajasthan and resumption of cricketing ties, optimism is high. In such an amicable scenario, the Indian government should initiate a dialogue with its Pakistan counterpart to make Hinglaj accessible to pilgrims and adventure-seeking Indians.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Quite obviously, the secular Bengali intelligentsia finds everything connected to Hindu religion or rituals a little funny, as Aveek Sarkar?s account of his trip made evident. That is why he compares Sati, whom millions of Hindus revere, with Helen of Troy. The 51 pithas have been called the ?Grand Slam of Indian pilgrimage?. At another place, he calls the pithas the ?National Democratic Alliance of Sati?. There are other gems, all denigrating the Hindu religion. I wonder if secularists like Sarkar can visit Mecca and analyse the history of the origin of the large black stone structure revered by Muslims the world over.

 Yours faithfully,

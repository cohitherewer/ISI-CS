The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 RESERVE AND DESTROY

 MALVIKA SINGH

 As the populism fire rages, Indian forests are under profound threat. Once again, to garner votes, and votes alone, political parties of all caste, creed and colour have come together in their selfish motivation to hand Indian national forests to individuals who happen to be tribals and other OBCs living on the fringes of forests. It is the most effective policy that will fulfil the dream of the desertification of India. It is also the most effective way of giving our poor and hitherto neglected tribals and other such exploited castes and classes, their first opportunity to make ?big? money. 

 Once the overarching bill goes through parliament, those who have strips of forest allocated to them will be able to sell their land to timber merchants and real estate developers. They will then be able to settle where they would be able to send their children to school, get their illnesses and ailments attended to, be able to buy their cell-phones and televisions, and move towards their aspirations. This ?gift? from a guilty, exploitative and failed state will help them get on with their lives!

 Some who receive the land could set up ?wildlife? resorts within the forest itself, take their guests on small game shoots and fishing expeditions, set up boutiques selling forest produce and present themselves as ?reserved? tourism. A scary scenario. Within a decade, drinking water will be contaminated and scarce, forcing the Cola companies to supply the drinking needs of over a billion people. New diseases will erupt allowing for innovative international research using Indians as guinea pigs as they reel under new strains of ?virus?. Sadly, the sane positions held by Jawarharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi on issues concerning the protection of the natural environment, particularly our forests and rivers, are being ridiculed by the present rulers in the UPA headed by the Congress. Acts are threatened and may well be repealed. An irreversible destruction of India seems to be underway in a very conscious and structured manner.

 Call their bluff

 Other oddities confront us as the summer heat soars.

 The cabinet secretary has got a ?one year? extension. Why? Is the next rung completely incompetent? Are the ?contenders? useless? Or is it the soft and easy option to stay out of a possible bureaucratic controversy laced with hectic lobbying? No one seems to be able to take firm decisions. Everything seems to be in limbo. It appears as though the prime minister is waiting for some kind of signal that never comes his way when he needs it and therefore silence prevails. It is almost deafening. Is this governance? Can leaders with integrity not deliver the goods? Are honest people incapable of taking hard decisions and leading? Is this government at the Centre going to be at the mercy of the Left for its entire term? 

 Because the numbers are not enough for the Congress in parliament, the Left, supporting from outside, is making sure that this government destroys itself. It suits them to debilitate the Congress. Their antagonism towards the Congress is a political truth, a sad commentary on this unholy alliance. Rather than be crippled by this strange animal, the UPA should get on with their agenda, whatever it may be, and allow the Left to pull the rug if they are foolish enough to do so. If the Congress and their coalition colleagues have to sit in the opposition, so be it. 

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee won the election in West Bengal, but Karat decides what is good for the state and its citizens. Their position on the international airport is laughable to say the least. Why doesn?t the politburo stick to building the rural infrastructure, making sure schools work and hospitals function competently, and leave the rest to their comrade in Calcutta?

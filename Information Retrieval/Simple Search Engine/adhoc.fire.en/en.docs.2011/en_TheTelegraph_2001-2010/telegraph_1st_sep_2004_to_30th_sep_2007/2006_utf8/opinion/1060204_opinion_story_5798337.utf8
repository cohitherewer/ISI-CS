 REPUBLIC DAY MUSINGS

THIS ABOVE ALL / KHUSHWANT SINGH

 Annual novelty

 It was the coldest Gantantra Diwas ever. I recall one winter over 70 years ago when the water in the marble fountain in my father?s house turned to solid ice. We had great fun smashing it and sucking ice cubes. This year the temperature came close to freezing point. There was frost in grass lawns and on the glass panes of cars but no ice. I was miserable, and remained tucked in my razaaee, with the heater on. Age makes a lot of difference in the way one looks on life. But I did wonder what all the talk about global warming amounted to. While the polar caps are melting due to warm gases, the tropics seem to be getting cooler. Or so it seemed this winter.

 However, there was no cooling in our country?s political atmosphere. On the contrary it came to a fever pitch with the judgment of the Supreme Court on the rights and wrongs of the dissolution of the Bihar assembly, delivered a couple of days before Republic Day. Though no longer a lawyer, I sensed what the judgment would be, as it turned out to be, and create serious problems for the government. It has already to weather storms created by the Nanavati Commission?s findings on Jagdish Tytler?s and Sajjan Kumar?s involvement in 1984 anti-Sikh violence, Natwar Singh?s role in the oil-for-food scam disclosed by the Volcker report and now the most serious of all ? Governor Buta Singh already castigated for honing on to a government bungalow in New Delhi while residing in Raj Bhavan of Patna. There was no option left to him but to quit. Seeing him brazenly standing over a platform with his enormous paunch sulking out taking the salute at a march-past in Patna Parade ground gave me a bad taste in the mouth. I hoped it would be the last time I would see the likes of him on TV. Come to think of it, the TV coverage of the parade in Delhi was also the poorest I could recall. Despite the imposing presence of King Abdullah ? he looks every inch an Imperial Majesty ? and the retinue of Saudi ministers and dignitaries, the spectacle was interrupted by news and commercials. I switched off my TV and decided to sit out in warm sunshine. I switched it on again to watch Beating the Retreat. I expect it will be the same as in the past years, but every year I enjoy it as if I was seeing it for the first time.

 Mind of a Mujahid

It is difficult to fathom what goes on in the mind 

of a man who is eager to die for a cause dearer to himself than his life and his 

family. Syeda Hameed, member, Planning Commission, translator of Hali?s Musaddas, 

me a poem by Zehra Nigah, one of the leading poets of Pakistan which explains 

in simple, stark words the mental make-up of mujahedins from Pakistan?s 

north-western regions. The people are amongst the poorest of the poor, very low 

in IQ. very high in religious fervour. It is entitled Kahaanee Gul Badshah 

kee (The Story of Gul Badshah). I produce the first four verses in Roman Urdu, 

with their free translation in English. It also shows how far Urdu poetry has 

travelled from bulbul and the rose, moth and flame, Laila and Majnu, to the harsh 

realities of life.

Naam meyra hai Gul Badshah

Umr meree hai tehra baras

Aur kahaanee meyree umr kee sarah

 (Gul Badshah is my name/ I am thirteen years of age/ the story of my life is the same as my age/ Short, fragmented and bitsy)

Meyree benaam, bey chehra Maa/

Bedawa mar gayee

Baap ney usko burqey mein dafna diya

Usko dar ttha Munkir Nakeer uska chehra na deykhen

Vaisey zinda thhee jab bhee voh madfoon tthhee

 (My mother had neither name nor/ face, one could say,/ Nor money for medicines/ She just faded away/ My father buried her in her burqa/ Lest recorders of deeds ogle at her face/ Even when alive, it could be said/ Though live she was one dead.)

Baap ke naam Zartaj Gul/Umr 

Battees baras

Voh mujahid shahaadat ka taalib

Raah-e-haq ka mussafir hua/our jaam-e-shahaadat 

usney

Meyrey chachaa kay haathon piya

Jo Shumaali mujaahid thha/Aur panj vaqta namazee 

bhee tthha

Masla is shahaadat ka peycheeda hai

Is sey behtar yahee hai/Issey yaheen chhor dein

 (My father?s name is Zartaj Gul/He is thirty-two/ He has one ambition to fulfil/ to / die a martyr/ He took the path of truth/And the/ cup of martyrdom/ From the hands of my uncle who/ belonged to northern martyrs? band/ And said his prayers five times a day./ The problem of martyrdom is hard/ to comprehend It it better left without an end.)

Ab behar haal Baba to Jannat mein hai

Uskee baahon mein hoor-o-Qusoor

Uskey haathon mein Jaam-e-tahoor

 (However, the old man is now in paradise/ In his arms he holds a virgin to make love to/ And a boy to sodomize/ In his hand he has a goblet of sparkling wine/ He is happy, he is fine.)

 How to keep off creditors

 A father told his young son to put off visitors as he feared creditors asking for return of their money which he was not in a position to repay.

 The bell rang and the father shut himself in a room. His son opened the door. Then the caller asked: ?Is your father at home?? The boy replied: ?No, he has gone out.?

 The caller asked: ?When is he expected to be back??

 The boy replied: ?After you have left.?

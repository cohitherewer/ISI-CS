 Letters to Editor

 Widen the net

 Sir ? The raid carried out by the Central Bureau of Investigation on the former chief minister of Haryana, Om Prakash Chautala, though belated, is a welcome step (?Busted: Chautala treasure chest?, May 5). Such raids should be conducted against politicians suspected of corruption, even when he is in power. Is it merely a coincidence that raids are carried out on houses of politicians who no longer hold political authority? No raids were conducted in the house of the former chief minister of Bihar, Rabri Devi, in spite of charges of holding illegal assets brought by Ram Vilas Paswan against her. This would indicate that the CBI is not so unbiased in its operation as it ought to be. In order to make the institution live up to its expected role in a democracy, it should be granted full autonomy in its work procedure.

 Yours faithfully,

Subhash C. Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi 

 Sir ? Om Prakash Chautala should be congratulated for his outstanding ability to amass a fortune worth Rs 1,467 crore during his tenure as the chief minister of Haryana. A typical characteristic of Indian politicians is said to be corruption and Chautala stands head and shoulders above the rest in this regard. He can perhaps give the starving millions of the country some tips on how to make quick money. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir ? The raid on Om Prakash Chautala?s holdings might have ulterior motives behind it, but it is a decisive move nonetheless. This is a sign that the arm of the law extends to the rich and the powerful as well. Yet one wonders whether the accused would meet the punishment he deserves for misappropriating public funds for personal benefit. Most of the income tax raids on top bracket politicians end up with the accused going scot free in spite of his proven crime. In order to make the raids meaningful, the CBI needs to publish reports on all the raids carried by it over the year so as to make the public aware of the total amount of cash and other assets seized, of the sum that was realized as tax and the penalty imposed on the defaulter. Besides, it should be made legally obligatory for every member of the parliament and politicians to file income tax returns. Their total income, along with its source, must be published in newspapers so as to make politicians accountable to the public. If all the politicians in India were to make true declarations of their wealth, the country would be able to boast of having some of the richest men in the world.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? There was a time when the tonnes of gold and the gold throne discovered in J. Jayalalithaa?s backyard convinced people of her vileness. But public memory is short and Jayalalithaa was back with a bang. Her undoing this time, remember, was not because of her acquisitions, the legal cases for which are still being tried out in different law courts. In India, corruption is a given. For all you know, Chautalas assets may even increase his political ratings.

 Yours faithfully,

N. Chatterjee, Calcutta

 False claim

 Sir ? The report, ?Child labour on the rise? (May 3), proves false the government?s claim to have rehabilitated children who worked as labourers. It also shows that the efforts of various NGOs to lower the number of child labourers have been in vain. The rampant poverty in India makes it more worthwhile for parents to send their children to earn a living than to get educated. A child is often the sole breadwinner in a family living below the poverty line. Unless there is a change in the social infrastructure which compels children to work when they should be studying, it will be difficult to eradicate this evil. Rehabilitation often does not work because the basic problem remains unresolved.

 Yours faithfully,

Moumita Nandi, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is incredible that a census report on child labour would not bother to include the informal sector in its survey when it is well known that most working children are employed as domestic help or as labour in the agricultural sector. The tall claims made by the government of an improvement in the situation have been proved to be hollow by the recent survey conducted by the Global March Against Child Labour. Despite the Child Labour Act of 1986 in place, there has been no sincere efforts to implement it. Besides, the act itself is not foolproof as it does not cover areas where a huge amount of child labour is concentrated. This failure is regrettable since a country cannot be said to have progressed if children continue to be deprived of basic education after nearly sixty years of independence.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Parting shot

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Looking at Calcutta? (May 6), may be right about the poor quality of contemporary architecture in Calcutta, but it overlooks a few handsome structures that have come up in the city recently. Though only a handful and of varying quality, these efforts of the dwindling minority of architects and their patrons deserve to be lauded. The taste in art and architecture is largely acquired, and discernment of quality requires both exposure and the ability to ?see?. The so-called cultural elite of Calcutta seems to be more interested in carping than actually experiencing art. This blindness to beauty has been reflected in the hideous structures that have come up in the city. 

 Given the expenditure involved, architecture is one art form that is totally dependent on patronage. Without the money, an architect cannot execute his vision. The dismal standard of architecture and urban design in present day Calcutta has this as well and other causes behind it. While being sympathetic towards such problems, one needs to highlight whatever is positive.

 Yours faithfully,

Devananda Chatterji, Calcutta

 TROUBLE IN THE CLASS

 Ardhendu Chatterjee

 With uncertainty staring aspiring teachers of West Bengal in the face, this years Teachers Day celebrations will seem hollow for them. The Calcutta high court has recently declared 36 B Ed colleges illegal. The students of these colleges are not sure whether they will be able to sit their final examinations. What is shocking in the entire affair is the cavalier attitude of the state government. It has not shown a jot of concern about the ordeal of a few thousand prospective teachers. Of course, education has seldom been a priority with the Marxist government of West Bengal. Its failure to improve the infrastructure of colleges is behind the current crisis facing the budding teachers. 

 Official sources have conveniently passed the buck to the students for not verifying the status of a college before taking admission. The truth is that students enrolled at these colleges because they were affiliated to state universities. Why did the universities not cancel their affiliation when the colleges failed to get clearance from the National Council for Teachers Education?

 The parameters set by the NCTE, which include among others a 10:1 student-teacher ratio, spacious classrooms, well-equipped laboratories, playground and separate common rooms for boys and girls cannot be said to be too high by any standard. The fact that some of the oldest B Ed colleges in West Bengal could not live up to the NCTE norms is a sad comment on the quality of training in these institutions. But had the NCTE taken a firm stand before, the colleges concerned would have made some effort to revamp their infrastructure much earlier. Most of them are not even full-fledged teachers training institutions, but undergraduate colleges with teachers training departments. The state government should have converted them into independent B Ed colleges along NCTE guidelines. 

 Legal questions

 As a face-saving gesture, the state government initially pleaded with the human resource development minister to bail the affected students out through an amendment of the NCTE laws. But the morass of rules and regulations is delaying the process. Moreover, the state governments reported nod to a move by the School Service Commission to deny the extra five marks, generally awarded to trained candidates, to the B Ed degree-holders from the illegal colleges in the selection process seems to be intriguing. For this years 5,000-odd teacher-trainees, this comes as another blow.

 The state governments endorsement is tantamount to non-recognition of the illegal colleges affiliated to state universities. It will defeat the very purpose of amending the NCTE Act to help these candidates take the exams. There are legal complications too. Degrees are awarded by universities and not by colleges. The SSC cannot follow double standards with students of the illegal colleges and those from the NCTE- approved colleges about the same university degree. The colleges may be illegal, but the university degree is not. 

 Second, the decision puts a question mark on the future of teachers already appointed on the strength of their B Ed degrees from the illegal colleges. Only last year the SSC recruited a large number of degree-holders from these colleges. The legality of their appointment could now be challenged. Most of the illegal colleges are pretty old, many of whose trained teachers have retired from service after the NCTE Act came into effect. Should they then return their salaries and pension benefits?

 A lot of expectation was generated when the new education ministers were inducted into the cabinet. They are new to the job, and hence cannot be held responsible for the present mess. But their inept handling of the issue has provided enough reason for disillusionment with them.

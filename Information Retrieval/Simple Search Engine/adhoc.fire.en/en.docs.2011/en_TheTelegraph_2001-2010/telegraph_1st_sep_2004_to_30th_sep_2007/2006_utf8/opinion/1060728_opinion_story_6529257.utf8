 Under the Indian banyan tree

 Selected Short Stories (Penguin, 

 Rs 250) by Mulk Raj Anand collects some well-known 

 stories by one of the best Indian storytellers. These are 

 from a time when simple Indian stories in English had not 

 been burdened with the ?Indo-Anglian? tag, and were far 

 less urbanized than contemporary fiction. Anand?s deep empathy 

 with men whose names never appear in the census, or with 

 those who love monkeys more than human beings makes his 

 stories treasures of Indian literature.

 Ten Essays on Shakespeare (Booklore, Rs 80) by Visvanath Chatterjee contains pieces mostly concerned ?with the meaning of a few Shakespeare plays?. Ophelia, Cordelia, Lady Macbeth and Desdemona feature in ?Shakespeare?s tragic heroines?. ?The uncertainty of Ophelia is the uncertainty of adolescence?, while ?Lady Macbeth is...wicked with a difference.? Two of the essays concern the influence of Shakespeare on literary stalwarts of Bengal.

 India?s Legal System: Can it be Saved? (Penguin, Rs 195) by Fali S. Nariman is a useful little offering from the ?Interrogating India? series. The Indian legal system is an Anglo-Saxon import, but ?what was intended to be an English oak has turned into a large, sprawling Indian banyan tree?. Not always with the best results though. Nariman draws up a list of the problem areas of Indian law: proliferation of appeals, judicial interference in administrative actions, lack of consistency at the highest level of judiciary, among others. Given that Indian law is as complex as it is filled with jargon, Nariman?s writing is refreshingly easy to read. However, a table of contents would have made the book more reader-friendly.

 Where the Child is without Fear (Earthcare, Rs 120) by Brendan MacCarthaigh explicates ?the SERVE system of education?, which begins with the assumption that ?nothing can be taught?. The teacher, more a guide and helper than a task-master, does not impose knowledge on the students, but helps them acquire knowledge for themselves. All these principles are culled from the teachings of Sri Aurobindo. There are quizzes instead of tests, ?circular teams? rather than classes, and many more differences with the traditional modes of teaching ? all formulated to make children ?develop initiative and become leaders?. The question is, are we ready to warm up to the new ideas?

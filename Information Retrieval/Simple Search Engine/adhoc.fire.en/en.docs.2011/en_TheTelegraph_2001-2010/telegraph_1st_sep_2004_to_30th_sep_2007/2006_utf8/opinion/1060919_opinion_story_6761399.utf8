 QUOTE, UNQUOTE

 There are two mysteries about Pope Benedict XVI: his quotations and his apologies. And the head of the Catholic Church owes it to the world not just the Muslim world to clarify his intentions when he is engaging in either of these practices. If the pope holds Islam in esteem then what is the point of quoting from an obscure Byzantine emperor about Islam being evil and inhuman in his Regensburg address? Was he using the passage as mere ornament? But that would be quite as bizarre, and far from innocuous. Besides, immediately after his apology on Sunday, he went on to quote, in Italian, a passage from St Paul about the crucifixion being a scandal for the Jews, which has justifiably caused further offence. His apology too, as some in the Turkish government have pointed out, is not free of equivocation: I am deeply sorry for the reactions in some countries to a few passages of my address. Is the pope sorry for having said what he said, or is he sorry for what has happened after his speech? His earlier apology, communicated through a Vatican spokesman, was a regret for the misinterpretation of his words. Again, he is concerned about the reception of his words rather than the words themselves which are, and are not, his own. This is equivocation in its classic form. Coming from somebody who passed up the opportunity, at Auschwitz in May, to apologize for the Roman Catholic Churchs conduct in World War II, such rhetorical games do sound sinister. 

 The popes words deserve condemnation, but do they call for the killing of a nun and the burning of churches? What has happened in Somalia and in the West Bank is just as far from the ambience of balanced and open debate in which religions must learn to live with one another and converse among themselves. Yet, the variety of responses to the popes words within the Islamic world is, in itself, heartening and makes any kind of reductive statement about Muslim vengefulness even more unacceptable. Turkey wants to go ahead with the papal visit, in spite of the popes doubts about Turkeys inclusion in the European Union. Islamic organizations in Germany (whose chancellor thinks that Benedict XVI has been misunderstood) and in Britain have also taken a moderate and sensible stance on the matter. It is now up to the Vatican to adapt its oratorical principles to the modern age.

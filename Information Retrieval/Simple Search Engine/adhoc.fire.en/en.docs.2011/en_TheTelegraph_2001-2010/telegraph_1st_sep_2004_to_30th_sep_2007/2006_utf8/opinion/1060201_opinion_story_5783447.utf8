 BEFORE THE DREAM SOURS

 India would do better to attend to the more press- ing domestic problems than try to join the UN high table uninvited, argues Raoji Bandodkar

 Right moves?

 For decades since our independence, the external affairs ministry harboured an obsession about Pakistan. Foreign governments were regarded as friendly or otherwise based on their tilt towards Delhi or Islamabad. At the same time, it was decreed that there could be no parity between India and Pakistan. Equidistance was therefore unacceptable and other countries were obliged to choose between the neighbours.

 Now a new obsession has taken hold of New Delhi. Since the middle of the Nineties, foreign capitals are being judged according to whether or not they support India?s claim for a permanent seat in the UN security council; visiting dignitaries are probed on the subject, and interpretations drawn from even the most opaque references to ?consensus? and ?UN reform?. It sometimes appears that Indian diplomacy is confined only to this one objective, and various arguments are cited in support of this goal, among them, population, democracy, size of the economy, prospects for growth, Asian and developing country representation, commitment to the UN and peacekeeping. National pride seems to demand that India lays claim to a permanent seat at the diplomatic high table, for without it, India?s role in world affairs would not be fulfilled.

 These arguments have doubtless been supplemented by more earthly blandishments, as is normal in inter-governmental relations. How much effort and resources have been extended to this effort for world status, how many and what sweeteners have been offered to the half-hearted for their support is never spelled out. What has been and will be the burden to the tax-payer? How many schools and hospitals, potable water projects and village roads have been postponed in pursuit of India?s international prestige? The concrete gains that this country can expect if there is a satisfactory outcome have not been properly spelled out, notwithstanding the current clear opposition of two permanent members, the US and China. The generalized argument is not enough. Will a permanent seat make India bigger, greater, economically more potent, enhance exports, improve infrastructure, attract investment, enable us to alleviate poverty, disease, malnutrition, and illiteracy?

 India will be expected to contribute more to international voluntary contributions, to peacekeeping and development budgets and to disaster relief. Yet this money would be better spent in improving the wretched condition that is the fate of a large proportion of our fellow citizens. As a permanent member of the security council, India will get involved in everyone else?s problems with the prospect of little reward, benefit or thanks. What does India propose to contribute to resolve the crises and tensions in Darfur, Ivory Coast, the Great Lakes, DRC, North Korea, Kosovo, Syria, Iraq, Haiti and Iran? What are New Delhi?s views on separatism in the Balkans, Kurdistan, Caucasus and Ukraine? Fence-sitting and deliberate ambiguity will no longer be an option. Will permanent membership enable India to play a more beneficient role in world affairs? Do France, Russia and the UK, all current permanent members, make any credible claims of exercising any such influence?

 There is an obvious contradiction between the argument of representing the developing world and India?s predictions of being a major economy by the middle of this century. If developing Asia is to be properly represented, the seat should go to Nepal or Bangladesh, who are further behind India in development. The plain reality is that whatever resources are available to the country would be better expended at home. Despite the tweakings of Mahbub-ul-Haq and Amartya Sen, the UNDP?s Human Development Index in 1999 placed India at 132 out of 174 countries. By 2005, it had climbed to 127 out of 177. In per capita GDP, India was ranked 131 out of 177 in the United Nations Human Development Report 2005. There were in 1996 only one-and-a-half personal computers per 1,000 persons, and, in 2003, only 17 per 1,000 persons had access to the internet. In 1999, Bihar had 54 per cent of its population at the level of human poverty. The 2005 report showed 28 per cent of the total population below the national poverty line, and 21 per cent undernourished. Malnutrition affects half the country?s children. One in 11 children dies in the first 5 years, and girls were 50 per cent more likely to die than boys. One in 4 girls and one in 10 boys do not attend primary school. Four states ? Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh ? accounted for more than 50 per cent of child deaths.

 No wonder the report concludes, ?India is a globalization success story with a mixed record on human development. Overcoming the legacy of decades of under-investment in human development and deep rooted gender inequalities poses immense challenges?. From the head of state downwards, the attention of the nation is focused on GDP growth, but such growth will be unsustainable without a new agricultural revolution. Moreover, GDP growth cannot by itself solve the problem of mass poverty for India without a socio-economic uplift among the rural population.

 What this should go to show is that the government would do better to turn its attentions to the domestic challenge than the dubious challenge of joining the high UN table and pontificating on world issues which are of no concern to the well-being of the common Indian citizen. The external affairs ministry?s quest is backed by parliament, and there is a ?national consensus? on this issue. But even democracies can be seriously misguided in such endeavours. Every country tends to parade its vanities and ambitions. Certainly, India is not the first and will not be the last country that has sought prestige overseas in preference to attending to pressing needs at home. Such fanciful international adventures have usually resulted in scant benefits. It is better to be invited to join a club when one?s credentials cannot be overlooked than to go about it as a petitioner pleading for membership.

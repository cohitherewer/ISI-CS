 Minority report

 Sir ? The prime minister?s 15-point programme for minority welfare exposes the government?s hypocrisy (?Funds quota for minorities?, June 23). After the hike in quotas in educational institutions, this policy tries to consolidate the Muslim votebank, especially in Uttar Pradesh, where assembly elections are due shortly. The package includes prevention of riots and rehabilitation of victims. One wonders what new steps can be taken to ease communal tensions. The package announced for Muslim victims of the riots is an attempt at appeasement. The Constitution grants the right to equality to citizens, even in the hour of crisis. Why should the minorities be singled out for benefit? Does the majority community never suffer any loss of lives and property during riots? The Supreme Court should intervene to stop this divide and rule policy. 

 Yours faithfully,

Jang Bahadur Singh, Jamshedpur

 Sir ? The United Progressive Alliance government seems to have a knack of inventing problems. The new package is but a ploy to divert attention from the real problems. The formation of the minority commission, the Sachar committee?s attempt to count Muslim heads in the army and other similar attempts make it clear that the government is doggedly pursuing policies aimed at widening the communal divide. Surely, the minorities have a right to live a better life but does their progress have to be at the cost of the majority? Why is the reformist zeal absent when it comes to the betterment of the latter? The government should think of the welfare of all citizens.

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad 

 Sir ? The decision to allot funds for the welfare of the minority communities is a vital step that will embolden India?s secular image. Though the government has taken the decision to secure peace and harmony between communities, it should not lose sight of the fact that communal differences will persist. The government should have been more tactful in dealing with the situation. The move can, in fact, backfire just like the anti-reservation protest which engulfed the entire nation. 

 Yours faithfully,

Kaushik Sen, Calcutta

 Sir ? The UPA government?s new formula to reserve a part of the national resources for minority welfare will end up in more reservations in educational institutions and employment. That may add up to almost 65 per cent reservations in education. This will adversely affect social relations between Hindus and the minorities. The government policy will further ruin the secular fabric of the nation. There should be reservations only for the economically weaker sections instead for specific castes and communities. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhankar Mukherjee, Burdwan

 Sir ? India is a conglomeration of various ethnic and religious communities. Therefore, we cannot strictly label any one community as the majority and term all the others minorities. Instead of introducing special facilities for some sections and dividing the society further, the state should concentrate on the uplift of the economically backward categories .

 Yours faithfully,

 Black sheep

 Sir ? In his article, ?The venal layer? (June 23), Ashok Mitra alleges that only the children of rich and influential men indulge in an unethical lifestyle. His views remind one of the story of the elephant and the three blind men. Mitra?s hatred for the affluent young are based on very little evidence. The rape, arson, dacoity and cheating that we read about in the newspapers everyday are committed by men who are not rich by any standards. The crowds at the brothels and bars are composed of common people. All politicians are not crooks, though the author might beg to differ. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The fact that politicians preach what they do not practice only shows their hypocrisy. Their children do the same, only they have no pretensions. Even if they are unscrupulous, they make no bones about it. The present generation seems to be prone to errant behaviour. Ashok Mitra should not target only those who are born into well-off families or those who have a political background. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asok Dasgupta, Calcutta

 Sir ? Why only politicians? Can Ashok Mitra be sure that venality has not touched the lesser mortals over whom they rule?

 Yours faithfully,

S. Chatterjee, Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 SPINNER OF MAGIC

 The world of cricket doffed its cap on Thursday to the greatest bowler it has ever seen when Shane Warne announced his retirement from the game. This might appear to be something of an exaggeration, given the fact that cricket has seen some really great bowlers. Think of F.R. Spofforth, S.F. Barnes, E.A. Macdonald, Harold Larwood, Clarrie Grimmet, Ray Lindwall, Freddie Trueman, Lance Gibbs, Michael Holding, Bishen Bedi the list is long. But there is something about Warnes statistics, together with the awe that he struck among all batsmen of his era, which makes him somewhat different from all the great bowlers. Much as Bradman is held to be above the likes of Victor Trumper, Jack Hobbs, Viv Richards and George Headley. Or as Gary Sobers is regarded as the supreme all-round cricketer. Shane Warne had that rare quality that sets apart the best from the greats.

 There are good cricketing reasons for holding this very high opinion. For one thing, the art of leg-spin bowling is the most difficult one in the game of cricket. Warne was a complete master of that art. The ball that comes out from the back of the hand is always a difficult one to control. Leg-spinners are known to stray in line and length. Warne seldom did. His awesome control made him a superb bowler even in the limited-over variety of the game. One of the most difficult things to control is the inward drift that leggies produce because of the spin they give to the ball. The more revolutions the ball does, the more it drifts. In other words, the larger the spin, the greater the drift. Warne was a prodigious spinner of the ball: he could pitch outside the leg stump and hit the off, as Mike Gatting recalls. But Warne could control the drift like no leg-spinner ever did.

 Ever since B.J.T. Bosanquet demonstrated that it was possible to bowl an off-break with a leg-spinners action, the bosie or the googly has become one of the principal weapons in the leg-spinners armoury. Warne bowled this with special venom and extracted phenomenal turn. Grimmet first bowled the flipper, the one that skidded through even though it came out of the back of the hand. Warne mastered it and it was often his wicket-taking ball. Warne was never a great flighter of the ball. One reason for this was his slightly round arm action. But the main reason was the fact that he revelled in beating his opponent off the ground rather than in the air.

 Warne was a complete leg-spinner. He had all the known weapons the leg-break, the googly, the flipper and the top-spinner and some more that were uniquely his own. To these abilities Warne added the aggressiveness of his personality. He seldom allowed any batsman to get on top of him. He was thus not only a genius as a spin bowler but also formidable as an opponent. Cricket-lovers will miss him but batsmen wont.

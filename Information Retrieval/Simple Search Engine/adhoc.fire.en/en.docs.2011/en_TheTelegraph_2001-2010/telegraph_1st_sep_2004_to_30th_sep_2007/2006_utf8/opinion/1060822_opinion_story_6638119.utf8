 FAIR GAME

 Man as player, homo ludens, tends to cheat as much as he plays. Fair play has always proved a hard act to follow. And cricket, burdened with its history of being the gentlemans game, was long perceived as the epitome of fair play. Rather wishfully as events have shown time and again. So when Mr Darrell Hair, one of the umpires in the test between Pakistan and England at the Oval, accused the Pakistani side of ball tampering, he inaugurated a new chapter in the swelling annals of cricket controversies. He and his colleague, Mr Billy Doctrove, fined Pakistan five runs in their opponents favour according to the rules. The matter could have ended there in spite of the myriad questions that usually follow an umpires independent decision. The umpire had judged and acted accordingly: the rulebook, that painstaking guide to fair play, had been followed. The Pakistan team, however, failed to come out to play after tea. The umpires and the English batsmen were back on the field on time. They returned to the pavilion and went out on the field a second time. That the Pakistan team still refused to show up sealed the game for them. The match was awarded to England.

 Accusations of tampering and chucking have often been levelled against bowlers, but action against teams or individual players for this kind of cheating has depended largely on the balancing games within the International Cricket Council. It might be refreshing, therefore, to find an umpire taking decisive action on the field. With the financial stakes for professional sport having reached mind-boggling scales, penalties for cheating need to be proportionately stringent. Neither is there any scope for the woozily optimistic belief that what happens in the other sports does not happen in cricket. Cheating is as old as sport itself. The discovery of Ben Johnsons use of an anabolic steroid in the Seoul Olympics in 1988 brought the issue of performance-enhancing drugs to the forefront. The effort to reduce drug use in sports has sharpened and widened since then. Such vigilance is necessary in every sport, for every form of cheating. But the judges, too, must have impeccable records of fairness. That is a little more than can be said of Mr Hair. But it is useless to say of unfair play that its not cricket. What David Lloyd has said, in a slightly different context, about the latest controversy is more to the point: For gods sake, its only cricket.

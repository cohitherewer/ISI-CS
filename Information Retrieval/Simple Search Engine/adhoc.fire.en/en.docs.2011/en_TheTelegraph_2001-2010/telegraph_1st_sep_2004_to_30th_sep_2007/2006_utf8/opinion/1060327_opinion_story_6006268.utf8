 Momentous events

 Sir ? Rudrangshu Mukherjee?s article, ?Patron of anniversaries? (March 12), makes a point which is unexceptionable. But the examples he takes ? the budgetary implications of two events that occurred 150 years ago ? is simplistic to a fault. The grant of Rs 10 crore for the celebration of the 150th anniversary of the first war of independence was probably done with an eye to pre-empt any move that the Bharatiya Janata Party might make ? a point Mukherjee does not note. The sum is, however, a mere pittance compared to the 100 crore allotted by our current prime minister to the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation in his first budget.

 The author feels that the tradition of militant nationalism died under the Gandhian dispensation. But it did not. The terrorist movements in Bengal, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and elsewhere, culminating in the Indian National Army and the naval mutiny, were just as important for the hasty departure of the British, as recent documents from Wavell to the British cabinet reveal. Bahadur Shah Zafar, whatever his shortcomings, remained an icon for freedom-fighters.

 The second example is the creation of the universities of Calcutta, Bombay and Madras, which were no doubt established to serve the purposes of the British. But did they not educate a new breed of students in the Western ideals of liberalism and democracy, which in turn gave rise to modern nationalism in India? What could have been pointed out is that a mere grant of funds cannot inject life into an educational morass and that the amount, divided among 50 departments and centres, will be a mere drop in the ocean.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Rudrangshu Mukherjee laments the use of political patronage by the finance minister in doling out largesse for the anniversary celebrations of the universities of Calcutta, Bombay and Madras as well as the revolt of 1857. The author seeks to emphasize the apparent contradiction in such celebrations: the setting up of the universities was a forward-looking event while 1857 is considered to be a throwback to the past. Even if the two events are accepted to be contradictory, Mukherjee ought to appreciate that pluralism and multiplicity of opinions lie at the very heart of the Indian democracy. While many would welcome the celebration of the founding of the three universities, many more consider the revolt of 1857 to be the first war of Indian independence. Mukherjee?s claim that India won its independence solely by non-violent means amounts to denying the contributions of such freedom fighters as Subhas Chandra Bose, Bhagat Singh, Surya Sen, Aurobindo Ghose and Rashbehari Bose and many other nameless martyrs from the INA, the Anushilan Samiti and the Ghadar Party. Mukherjee?s tendentious arguments smack of the kind of historical revisionism that we usually associate with the BJP. 

 Yours faithfully,

Srijit Basu, Calcutta

 Sir ? One only hopes that the University of Calcutta will be able to make fruitful use of the Rs 100 crore grant it is due to receive from the Union government. Apparently, a bulk of the amount will be used for funding researches. But the university administration should also pay attention to updating and overhauling its existing infrastructure to provide basic educational facilities to larger number of people. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Just because Rudrangshu Mukherjee resents the first war of Indian independence being called such, he accuses the finance minister of patronage-mongering. While accepting that the British role in north India collapsed as a result of the mutiny and that the sepoys, peasants, landholders and princes took to arms to defend their society and customs, Mukherjee nonetheless refutes the theory that 1857 was a landmark in India?s freedom struggle. For historians like him, it only marks a throwback to a regressive order. Hundreds of soldiers sacrificing their lives, or several kings, chieftains and landlords putting all they had at stake is of no consequence to these scholars. There is no denying that the movement that ultimately won the freedom was a non-violent one. But can one leave out revolutionaries like Bhagat Singh and Khudiram Bose when chronicling modern Indian history? Then there is V.D. Savarkar, who has become the favourite whipping-boy of the non-right just because he coined the term ?first war of independence?. Whether the events of 1857 need to be celebrated is not to be decided by historians like Mukherjee. But please let us not deny that it was the first organized effort on the part of the people of India to throw out the occupants, and as such, it deserves commemoration. It is a pleasant surprise that the finance minister has recognized this. 

 Yours faithfully,

Rajprabha Dasani, Calcutta

 Unsporting

 Sir ? For Diwan Asgar Nabi, the masseur with the Indian Commonwealth Games team who has been accused of molesting a girl in the games village, the law will take its own course (?Indian shame at Games?, March 16). But the Indian government should immediately take action against the Sports Authority of India official, who, at the last moment, deleted the names of qualified masseurs and included Nabi?s name in the contingent. Not only was Nabi unqualified for the job, but he also produced false educational certificates. Action should also be taken against the politician under whose recommendation the SAI official acted. Nepotism is no less a crime than sexual abuse.

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta 

 Sir ? India?s prestige has been lowered at the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. The accused masseur?s selection in spite of his dubious past confirms that politics has invaded sports. 

 Yours faithfully,

 ONGCS CLOUT

 Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and its partners put in the largest number of winning bids for deep-water blocks in the sixth round of new exploration licensing policy. But the directorate general of hydrocarbons, the oil industry regulator, recommended against awarding the blocks to them; instead it recommended that those blocks should be awarded to foreign companies by negotiations. This was deeply unwelcome to ONGC and its parent petroleum ministry; when the DGHs recommendations went to the empowered committee of secretaries, the petroleum secretary persuaded it to overturn DGHs recommendation and award the blocks to the ONGC consortium.

 Till the Nineties, India had a poor reputation amongst the worlds oil companies, which rightly felt that India unfairly favoured its own government companies. That is why the government set up the NELP mechanism: the procedure for inviting bids and awarding exploration licences was clearly defined, and DGH was made the neutral evaluator of bids. This mechanism has served India well. Although ONGC and, lately, Reliance, have been awarded most of the licences, the succeeding rounds have attracted a large number of bids from all over the world. The governments objective of accelerating exploration and bringing in the best qualified companies at no cost to itself has been achieved. That is why it is important to safeguard the integrity of the process.

 The question is: who is its better guardian? The ECS, which insists that the blocks be awarded to the highest bidder, or the DGH, which wants ONGC to be disqualified for non-performance? Despite the half-truths fed to the press, it is well established that ONGC has asked for extensions to the exploration programmes it was committed to and obtained them. So the DGH is perfectly right in its assertion that ONGC has not fulfilled its commitments. If the ECS favours ONGC despite its poor performance, it may help its own, but it will grievously damage international confidence in NELP. ONGC can and will live with NELP, but NELP cannot survive the ECSs favouritism. It is easy to see why the ECS is pressed to help out ONGC. ONGC is sitting on a mountain of cash and has been bidding for acreage all over the world, but with little success, because Chinas CNOOC outbids it every time. In the circumstances, it is natural that it should want to guard its home turf. The ECSs recommendations would go to the cabinet. One way out of the imbroglio would be to award the blocks to ONGC, but to cancel all the past exploration licences on which it has not fulfilled the conditions. Maybe that will force ONGC to concentrate on the bird in hand and not to keep chasing birds in foreign lands. But if the government wants to rid itself of continual headaches, it should privatize ONGC. Reliance is no less a national champion because it is privately owned.

 Letters to Editor

 Hold your tongue

 Sir Greg Chappells statement that members of parliament in the country get paid for making comments reflects the Australians disrespect towards Indian democracy (Greg on MPs, Nov 27). Chappell should not forget that MPs, as peoples representatives, have every right to raise an issue that concerns public interest. Chappell would do well to remember that in his capacity as the coach of the Indian team, he now represents the country and is as much responsible as the players for their performance. He must, therefore, refrain from doing or saying things that would hurt the sentiments of the people.In fact, he should resign from his job if he cannot control his tongue and learn to handle criticism.

 Yours faithfully,

B.K. Mahapatro, Berhampur

 Sir Greg Chappell has insulted the Indian parliamentary system with his disparaging remark about Indian MPs. The parliament should not treat the matter lightly nor waste time by sitting on it. Only a stinging reproach on the part of Indian politicians would ensure that Chappell does not make the mistake of opening his mouth in the future. 

 Yours faithfully,

Pijush Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir What Greg Chappell has achieved with the Indian team in just a little more than a year is there for everyone to see. But his comment against the MPs really takes the cake. The foreign coach should not be allowed to get away with his words, or, for that matter, his ugly gestures. Remember the finger-showing incident at the Eden Gardens? 

 Yours faithfully,

Vivek Shahdeo, Ranchi

 Sir The parliamentarians should thank Greg Chappell, instead of criticizing him. There are many issues of national importance that need to be addressed on a warfooting, such as the countrys poor position in the international welfare index, hunger deaths, the lack of basic amenities like water and elementary healthcare and the rise in the number of suicides among farmers. Now it appears that all these issues can be put on hold while the MPs waste there time on trivial issues like the comments made by the countrys cricket coach. It would be in the interest of cricket if politicians left the game alone and concentrated on other problems affecting the country.

 Yours faithfully,

Ashok S.Mehta, Calcutta

 Sir Greg Chappell draws a handsome salary and the MPs are well within their rights to criticize the coach for a poor performance on the part of his team. The fact is that Kiran More, Greg Chappell and Rahul Dravid have destroyed the team spirit, which was the hallmark of the team under Sourav Ganguly. The personal whims and fancies of these three men now decide matters when it comes to selecting the side. Chappell is not exactly a gentleman but the least he can do now is resign from his lucrative job. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.K. Bhattacharya, Calcutta

 Sir People screaming for Greg Chappells blood should know that he is not the cause of Indias dismal performance in South Africa. The selectors have given him a bunch of players with feet of clay. Assured of their place in the national squad, the stars in the Indian team no longer care to adapt themselves to new and adverse playing conditions. Ready money from endorsement contracts has deprived them of the motivation to perform on the pitch. If Indian cricket is to be rescued from the pits, only a players performance should be considered while selecting a squad. Every member of the national squad should be periodically made to play domestic cricket and selected after proving his worth each time. The selectors should also create a bigger pool to ensure that players are rotated on a regular basis. Not all these measures would be popular, but then, what is uncomfortable for the players may indeed be the best hope for cricket in India. 

 Yours faithfully,

K. Venkataraman, Mumbai

 Sir Under Greg Chappell, the performance of Team India is going down hill. In the present circumstances, he should be asked to step down to generate a revival of Indias flagging fortunes. And it is not as if there is a shortage of gifted coaches in India. The selectors only need to appoint someone from the many cricketing legends in the country.

 Yours faithfully,

Sankar Chatterjee, Canberra

 Sir In order to restore the confidence of fans, spectators and sponsors, the Indian cricket board should immediately convene a series with Bangladesh and Zimbabwe in India. This would help the Tendulkars and Sehwags score a lot of runs. The team would also rediscover its winning ways and Rahul Dravids reputation as captain would be salvaged. 

 Yours faithfully,

Udita Agrawal, New Delhi

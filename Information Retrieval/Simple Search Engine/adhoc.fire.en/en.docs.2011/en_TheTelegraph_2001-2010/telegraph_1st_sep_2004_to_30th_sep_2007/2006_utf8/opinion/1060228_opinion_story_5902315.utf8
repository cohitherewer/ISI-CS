 A STIMULATING STUDY

 The independent ASER 2005 survey revealed that India?s school system is not geared to help children learn, writes Vimala Ramachandran

 Number-crunching

 If we are to believe what the government tells us, then almost all our children are in school, the government has solved the problem of access, and schools are now available in the remotest corners of the country. The claim is often challenged by sample surveys. In 1999, a Probe survey showed that there is a huge demand for education but many poor children across the country do not have any access to a functioning school. The Pratichi education report of 2002 drew attention to the dysfunctional primary schools in West Bengal and the prevalence of private tuitions. Similarly, the National Sample Survey and the National Family Health Survey revealed the huge gap between formal enrolment and actual attendance, and that only 78 per cent of rural boys and 61 per cent rural girls actually attend school. 

 ASER 2005, the first annual status of education report facilitated by Pratham, has once again drawn attention to the situation in schools. The survey was done in 485 of 600 districts across the country. It brought together a wide range of people ? from local voluntary organizations to ordinary citizens. Another interesting point is that individual donors or institutions contributed Rs 500 to Rs 10,000 each to cover the cost of the survey and paid for 373 districts.

 The survey consisted of three parts ? household-level interviews, testing of children (using tests to assess ability to read and to do simple arithmetic at the class II level) and status of government schools. The findings of ASER 2005 are interesting. Over 90 per cent of the children interviewed were formally enrolled in schools. The gender gap in the percentage of out-of-school children has come down. Till 2001, it was estimated that over 65 per cent of out-of-school children were girls. Now it is 52 per cent (6-10 age) and 55 per cent (11-14 age). The survey also found that 100 per cent teachers were present in 50 per cent of the primary schools visited and the average teacher attendance was around 77 per cent. The flip side is also interesting ? 37.2 per cent primary schools and 25 per cent upper primary schools visited in Kerala did not have any teacher present on the day of visit.

 The not-so-good news is that only 71 per cent of the enrolled children were attending school. There were regional variations. In Bihar, only 51 per cent of the enrolled children were attending school and almost 4 out of 10 schools recorded less than 50 per cent attendance. In comparison, close to 87 per cent children attend school in Tamil Nadu, 93 per cent in Kerala and 70 per cent in Rajasthan. Close to 1.4 crore children are out of school. In West Bengal, the percentage of out-of-school children is 4.4 per cent, only 70 per cent of enrolled children attend school and 81 per cent of the teachers were present in school on the day of the survey. 

 ASER 2005 did not test children for age or grade specific competency. It tested the ability of children to read. Close to 35 per cent of the children in the 7-14 age group could not read a simple paragraph (grade I level difficulty) and almost 60 per cent children could not read a simple story (grade II level difficulty). The findings with respect to reading ability in different classes are interesting. Children are able to read a short story (grade II level) only by the time they reach class III or IV. Essentially, children who manage to stay in school till class V acquire some basic reading skills.

 What is worrying is that many class VIII children cannot read. Close to 50 per cent children in Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh could not read a one-page story. The percentage of class V children who could not read is 18.6 per cent in Kerala, 21.4 per cent in Uttaranchal, 25.5 per cent in West Bengal and 28.7 per cent in Bihar. In West Bengal, around 18 per cent children in class V could not read. The situation in Purulia was the worst (50 per cent in class V could not read) followed by Maldah (44.9 per cent) and Howrah (41 per cent). The situation in private schools is no different.

 The situation with respect to mathematics is also alarming. About 65.5 per cent of the children in the 7-14 age group could not tackle simple arithmetic problems. More worrying is that 47 per cent of children in the 11-14 age could not solve class II level arithmetic problems. Over 60 per cent of children in class V were not able to solve simple sums across states like Karnataka, Orissa, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. In comparison, less than 40 per cent children could not solve the same type of maths problems in West Bengal, Haryana, Bihar, Uttaranchal and Chhattisgarh.

 This certainly does not mean that the quality of education is better in Bihar than in Tamil Nadu. It is important to interpret these findings with caution. It has to be noted that while a significant proportion entering class I reach class V in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, the drop out rate in Bihar is high and only 51.8 per cent of enrolled children attend school regularly. Therefore, the ones who have reached class V are not only a self-selected group but they are the ones who are highly motivated. Conversely, a very large proportion of children who enter class I make it to class V in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka ? and they are a mixed lot. Given the automatic promotion system, being in class V does not really tell us anything about the children. 

 What is most worrying is that learning continues to be a big issue and the school system does not seem to be geared to help children learn. It is managed like a big number game ? pushing numbers, playing with figures and charts and showing the world all is well. But we have to ask hard questions. There is an urgent need to see when and how good provisions (classrooms, teachers, textbooks, mid-day meal and so on) translate into learning outcomes.

 The single-most important contribution of ASER is that an independent group got together to find out what is really happening to our children. Creating a space for independent (neither government sponsored or donor driven) assessment of India?s progress towards universal elementary education is invaluable. Quick surveys are invariably frowned upon by the academia. But it may be worthwhile to reflect whether simple testing methods could actually empower families and civil society organizations to start a dialogue with teachers on what and how much our children are learning. A day may come when community groups will audit the integrated child development services, the primary health centres, district hospitals and other healthcare institutions, and also keep a vigil on the public distribution system.

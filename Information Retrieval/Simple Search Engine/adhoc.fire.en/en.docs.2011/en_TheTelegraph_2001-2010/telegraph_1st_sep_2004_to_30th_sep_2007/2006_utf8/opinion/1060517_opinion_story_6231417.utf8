 PROTECTING THE INNOCENTS

 DOCUMENT

 Excerpts from the draft bill of the Offences Against Children Act, 2005

 The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which India ratified in 1992, obligates member states to take affirmative action in protecting children from all forms of sexual abuse, neglect, exploitation, torture, or any form of cruelty. Every child in India is entitled to the rights and freedoms enumerated in the Constitution of India and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Internationally, almost all countries have legislation in place to protect children with a focus on the child rights approach. Under this approach, any transgression of a child?s rights to live without sexual abuse, violence and other forms of physical and mental torture, is a punishable offence.

 Statement of Objects: To address the legitimate right of these children to enjoy the rights guaranteed for all children by the United Nations and by the Constitution of India, the government of India is enacting this legislation.

 To identify offences against children and protect children from offences.

 To provide for punishment against persons who have committed offences against children.

 To set in place rules to fulfil the objectives of this Act.

 Although India has the largest child population in the world, there is no separate legislation to deal with offences against children. The existing legislation dealing with children, the Juvenile Justice Act 2000, deals primarily with children in conflict with the law and not with the persons who commit crimes against children or the child victims. In view of this, it is considered essential that the government enact a separate child abuse law clearly defining the rights of and remedies for children.

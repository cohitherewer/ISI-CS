 MAKEOVER

 Eight years ago, the Bahujan Samaj Party celebrated the 75th birthday of Mr Kanshi Ram, its founder. He was presented with a purse of Rs 75 lakh; Ms Mayavati, who organized the ceremony, was given Rs 42 lakh ? Rs 1 lakh for each of her completed years. Newspapers carried full-page advertisements; roads of Delhi were festooned. Eight years later, newspapers again carried big advertisements last Sunday congratulating Ms Mayavati on her 50th birthday.

 As usual, they pictured her in finery and jewellery. But there was something wrong at the bottom: the organizers had surnames like Goyal, Agarwal and Gupta ? typically traders? names. Even more shocking was the slogan: ?Bahujan, Mahajan Bhai Bhai?. What was happening to this party, built up on confrontation with upper castes ? Tilak, Tarazu aur Talwar as portrayed in its picturesque slogan? It is abandoning its cause, slowly but surely. Early last year, Ms Mayavati set up district brotherhood committees in Uttar Pradesh headed by Brahmins; the courtship ended in a Brahmin rally. She promised them proportional representation in her caste coalition. But Brahmins are not enough. The BSP needs money. In UP, money goes to whoever is in power. Power went once to organized castes. The BSP organized the Dalits in UP, and turned them into a political force. But organization was not enough; a coalition had to be built up to attain a majority. After her betrayal of the Samajwadi Party in 1995 and the Bharatiya Janata Party in 2003, Ms Mayavati finds allies hard to come by. A bit lonely now, she has decided to make friends with her chosen enemies, the upper castes. And none are more important than the moneyed trader castes.

 However, there is another lesson which Mr Mulayam Singh Yadav has learnt: that politics frames the image of a state. The rise of the communists and their endless demonstrations scared industry away from West Bengal. In UP, it was the insatiable greed of politicians. Whenever a politician is short of cash, he turns to the nearest sugar mill. The business of collection has been centralized and private extortion curbed by recent governments; but the informal taxation continues. It has reached its limits; Mr Mulayam Singh Yadav has learnt that the slice cannot get bigger unless the cake expands. He is not the most charming of salesmen; but Mr Amar Singh has made some influential friends on his behalf. The first thing Mr Nitish Kumar did on becoming chief minister of Bihar was to go on television and, in an advertisement, invite industrialists to invest in Bihar. Slowly, north Indian politicians have become aware that the south has left the north far behind in the past 25 years, and that their dirty politics is part of the reason. Can Ms Mayavati do a makeover and present a clean image? That will be a prospect worth watching.

Letters to Editor

Loaded with it 

Sir One cannot but empathize with Bill Gates (Problem 

of plenty for Gates society, Aug 14). Over and above the problem of having to 

identify ways to disburse $30 billion of his own foundation, he is now saddled 

with Warren Buffets gift of $31 billion, which must be given away fast to save 

on taxes. Small wonder the foundations new COO has been cribbing about that 

kind of load. Nothing much can be done about Gatess immediate problems. But 

he could start by reducing the prices of his most popular products (and thus cut 

down on profits and the expendable amount) to prevent his problems from becoming 

monumental. 

Yours faithfully, 

Rupnarayan Bose, Calcutta

Nothing special 

Sir As usual, the president, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, 

chose a subject pertinent to the nations development when he addressed the nation 

on Independence Day eve. He invoked the theme of national awakening and, in 

his inimitable style, exhorted citizens and officials to achieve comprehensive 

national security. His suggestion to launch a national campaign to eradicate terrorism 

should be taken seriously, as also his wish that the government formulates a security 

bill and an energy independence bill. This is Kalams last address to the nation 

prior to the Independence Day as he might go back to teaching rather than run 

for a second presidential term. One hopes his advice will be heeded. 

Yours faithfully, 

S. Balakrishnan, Jamshedpur

Sir The prime ministers speech at the Red Fort 

failed to impress. There was no mention of controversies like office-of-profit 

or the forced amendments to the Right to Information Act subjects on which every 

right-thinking person expects him to speak up. He also avoided mentioning issues 

like the womens reservation bill although, traditionally, prime ministers of 

different parties have assured the nation of such legislation in their Independence 

Day speeches. 

Yours faithfully, 

Madhu Agrawal, Dariba, Delhi 

Sir We all celebrated our Independence Day with 

great pride. The tricolour adorned the chests of stylish Indian youth, the nails 

of fashionable Indian girls and was put on mannequins in shopping malls. Today, 

Independence Day is all about commercialism. There were I-Day special bonanzas 

at nightclubs, and Bollywood movies on TV channels. There were also Indian idols 

with their faces painted with the colours to wish us Happy Independence Day. 

Yours faithfully, 

Soham Gupta, Calcutta 

Sir Terrorist threats on Independence Day are now 

a routine affair. Consequently, there is greater vigilance in crowded places and 

government installations. Security checks in private buildings are also inevitable, 

particularly when a VVIP visit is scheduled in the locality. Yet, the feeling 

of being watched and imprisoned in ones home because of security excess in the 

predominantly Muslim areas surrounding the Red Fort is a matter of serious concern 

(Tea with sniper, Aug 15). It is essential that the law-keepers add a humane 

touch to their work so that there is no feeling of discrimination. 

Yours faithfully, 

Ranadhish Choudhuri, Calcutta

Sir Many of our legislators were unable to give 

the name of the composer of the national anthem or the full name of Mahatma Gandhi 

when asked by a news channel. Surprisingly, they showed no sign of embarrassment. 

How could they have been elected to one of the highest bodies of governance with 

such appalling knowledge about the nation? 

Yours faithfully, 

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta

 UNTOUCHED BY THE DEMOCRATIC SPIRIT

 Yet another election is coming up in Bangladesh, but its political parties have never really paid heed to polls and their verdicts, writes Sumanta Sen

 Test of friendship: Indira Gandhi with Mujibur Rahman

 Political parties fighting with each other is a normal sight in any democracy. In neighbouring Bangladesh, however, that fight is not kept restricted to the floor of parliament or public rallies. It invariably spills out on the roads, leading to loss of life and property. Such rioting is as regular as the floods every year and neither phenomenon seems to cause much concern in the small nation, ravaged also by poverty and corruption.

 It would, therefore, have been highly surprising if the run up to the January polls had been smooth and peaceful. In a country where physical elimination of political rivals has become almost a part of daily life, it would have been nave to expect the guns to be holstered and the knives sheathed.

 The situation should appear even more natural in the context of what has happened in the last few years. The opposition Awami League and its allies stayed away from the Jatiya Samsad or parliament for most part of the period. This did not help in the creation of a healthy political atmosphere. It is true that the ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party and its allies, the fundamentalist forces, were as much to blame for this. The fact thus remains that neither side had taken any step towards the creation of a situation conducive to the functioning of constitutional politics. 

 In India, too, the ruling party and the opposition are very often at loggerheads but without the degree of mistrust between the two forces, as seen in Bangladesh. Even amidst all the bickering, the politicians in India are aware that both sides must share the responsibility of keeping parliamentary democracy alive, and strengthening it. That realization appears to be missing on the other side of the eastern border.

 Perhaps there is a historical reason behind this. The people of Bangladesh have never been allowed to live in a democratic environment. Before Partition, it was the Muslim League which was the dominant party among the majority in East Bengal and the party did not enjoy much democracy within itself. Soon after 1947 and the birth of East Pakistan, the Muslim League had to give way to the Awami League, which had always been associated with an individual, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Then emerged the National Awami Party, which also had Maulana Bhasani as the sole representative face. Also, the long years of military rule did not allow the kind of constitutional functioning that is essential for democracy to prosper. 

 India, on the other hand, saw an entirely different picture. The Congress was not Nehru alone, the other parties also had more than one stalwart in the leadership, inner-party democracy was distinctly present and so was the democratic spirit. The warning bells that rang out during the Indira Gandhi regime mercifully died down before it was too late, as the lady herself realized that the conditions would not allow the perpetuation of the myth that Indira was India. Barring that short period of Emergency, the ruling party and the opposition, both at the national and state levels, have never been sworn enemies, only healthy rivals.

 This spirit never existed in Bangladesh. After the birth of the new nation, it was naturally Mujibur Rahman all the way. But with time, the sheen began to wear off, thanks almost wholly to the misrule of the government headed by that iconic figure. In a totally dictatorial manner, Rahman hit back with the formation of the Bangladesh Krishak Sramik Awami League, which was to be the sole political entity in a nation still labelled democratic. Interestingly, this had taken place shortly before Indira Gandhi had suspended democratic functioning in India and it is quite possible that the two developments were linked. Neither Rahman, nor his experiment, however, lasted long, but the spirit contrary to democracy that he had displayed seems to have survived him.

 Even earlier, the Awami League had not shown much interest in allying with other political forces. There were charges that the massive electoral victory it had achieved in early 1971 had largely been a rigged affair. 

 That charge may or may not have been true, but there can be no denying the fact that during the sojourn in Calcutta after the Pakistan army had cracked down, the Awami League did not spare any effort in insisting that the Indian authorities extend no help to freedom fighters owing allegiance to any other political belief. It was a strange and disturbing sight of one refugee seeking to deny another his legitimate dues. India, of course, had willingly cooperated, a cooperation that later earned for Awami League the label, Indian stooge. It helped neither the Awami League, nor New Delhi. But that is another story.

 On the other side of the picture is the BNP. On the issue of democracy, there should not be any great expectation from it either. Headed by the widow of an army dictator, its sole purpose is to remain in office even if that means helping religious orthodoxy. 

 Indeed, the outgoing ruling coalitions attempts to get a BNP sympathizer to head the caretaker ministry between now and January, was in violation of all democratic norms. The opposition is now saying that such violations had marked the entire tenure of Begum Khaleda Zias government. This may be true, but is there much to be hoped from the Awami League on this score? The Jatiyo Dal of another former military ruler, Hussain Mohammed Ershad, also does not inspire much confidence.

 It may be argued that since all parties are gearing up for the January election, which in itself is a democratic process, there is nothing to worry about. But that process is one of the trappings of democracy which can be conveniently discarded once it is over and the victor takes charge. Therein lies the danger in Bangladesh. There can be no guarantee that the loser will accept the verdict and function as a responsible opposition. It is a tailor-made situation for the army to come out of the barracks once again for restoring order as the politicians have failed. 

 The recent statement of Mohammed Yunus that he may float a new political party is a clear indication that within the country, eminent citizens are getting restless with what they see, and no party can say, It is not us but the others who are responsible for this mess.

 What can the January poll mean for India? Perhaps a lot, and then nothing. If the Awami League wins, hopes are sure to grow in New Delhi and Calcutta of the new government dealing firmly with the rebels from India. But in all likelihood, these hopes would soon be dashed, as Sheikh Hasina cannot possibly ignore her compulsions, both at home and abroad. Here, she is sure to be democratic since she would have to cater to fundamentalists within Bangladesh and their mentors in another country. She has done so before.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Back at square one

 Sir ? The chief minister of West Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, has taken a disturbing and retrograde step (?Writing on the wall?, May 30). Bhattacharjee had earlier expressed his desire to beautify Calcutta. Therefore, his decision to repeal the West Bengal Prevention of Property Defacement Act, 1976 is all the more appalling. Once that proposal is passed in the assembly, every political party will have the legal right to put up posters and banners wherever they wish. It is frightening to imagine what will happen during labour agitations: Perhaps, Calcutta will see workers defacing the Victoria Memorial. 

 Cultural and historical landmarks, such as the Indian Museum, the National Library, the Jain Temple and so on, will all be desecrated. Then will come the turn of office complexes, hotel lobbies, clubs and shopping malls. The march of barbarism will not spare even hospitals and nursing homes. The householder will face the ire of the party cadre should he dare to protest against the creations on his walls by the artists of the great proletarian dream. Thus, a dirty city will be made to look dirtier and the people who elected the government will be trampled upon by that very government. One can only hope that Bhattacharjee will see reason before it is too late. 

 Yours faithfully

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Sir ? The Left Front?s decision to repeal the anti-defacement law is an indicator of how much ?productive? work the state government intends to undertake in the coming years. While most cities are working towards beautification, the West Bengal government seems bent on reinstating the old practice of painting political graffiti to make cities and towns look ugly. What right does a political party have to paint the walls of buildings to propagate its maxims? To force political sermons upon someone?s walls against their will violates their rights. This sign of political domination will also deter investors. (Imagine their feelings when they see political graffiti instead of advertisements!) 

 It is sad that the ?new look? government promised by the left before the polls cannot be a reality. As for Bhattacharjee himself, his credibility is at stake following this decision.

 Yours faithfully,

Avishek Ganguly, Howrah

 Sir ? Not many of those who voted the left back to power would like to have their walls defaced by political graffiti. Given the fact that the Election Commission?s ban on graffiti did not affect the left?s electoral prospects, the decision to repeal the anti-defacement law defies logic. Even those who were afraid of the left cadre?s strong-arm tactics had to acknowledge that the majority of voters wished that the left should continue in power. 

 But some of the left leaders had taken offence at the EC?s ban. The reinstatement of graffiti seems like arrogance and a kind of one-upmanship against the EC, since the Left Front has no need to prove its worth anymore. The time and energy it is spending on the new proposal should have been channelled into completing more important tasks. After all, this is why the people decided to bring back Bhattacharjee to power. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir ? Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee should be asked a simple question: what is more draconian ? preventing the defacing of walls, or the submission of property-owners to the muscle-power of goons bent on messing up buildings to advertise political parties? And with regard to the mayor?s assurance about ?willing? owners ? will the owner?s consent be sought, or his refusal accepted? It is to be hoped that the citizens? awareness of their rights will prompt them to put up a stronger resistance than before to the defacement of their property. 

 Yours faithfully,

Amit Banerjee, Calcutta

 Sir ? The chief minister has cited London and Paris in defence of his move to bring graffiti back. This is pure bluff. One who has lived in the United Kingdom for nearly 45 years could tell him that beautification laws in borough and county councils are stiff and defacement of walls is a punishable offence. The graffiti Bhattacharjee may have seen in London was certainly illegal. He should look at the general cleanliness of the city. Yet, when I had arrived in London in 1961, it was so shabby that I felt like going back to Calcutta since it was a cleaner and prettier city. Their present states tell contrasting tales of the two cities.

 Yours faithfully,

Arun Sen, Kent, UK

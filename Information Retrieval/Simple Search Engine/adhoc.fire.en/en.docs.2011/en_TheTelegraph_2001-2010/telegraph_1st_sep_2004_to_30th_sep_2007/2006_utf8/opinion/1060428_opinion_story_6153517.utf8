The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 POLL PAX

 An event becomes a non-event. The absence of a problem poses a problem. Nothing happened on election day in Calcutta. People went in thousand and voted. This, it may well be argued, is how it should be. But the people of Calcutta have grown used to a different kind of election. An election meant violence, street fights; an election was a happening. Yesterday the streets of Calcutta may have been deserted, given the city the look of a bandh but nothing untoward took place. The machinery of the Election Commission was in place and the people went and voted. Pundits can ponder about the meaning and the implication of the high turn out in the polls. But for the moment there can only be joy and relief that the people of Calcutta, irrespective of their social origins, exercised their right to vote without fear. The point is important because the accepted picture of election in Calcutta is that of violence. Psephologists generally agree that manipulation of the polls ? rigging, in the jargon ? cannot really affect overall results. Statistically, there is safety in numbers. But the presence of fear even among a miniscule minority vitiates the spirit and the atmosphere of democracy. Thus violence and intimidation during election need to be eradicated even if they do not have an impact on the final outcome. The polling in Calcutta has demonstrated that this cleaning up of the democratic process has been successful.

 The discipline that the EC has brought to elections in Calcutta has brought forth many adverse comments. One major criticism has been that the EC has removed the carnival element from elections. This is true but can hardly be counted as something that should be criticised. Why should the most critical aspect of a democracy be treated as a carnival, as if it is something to celebrate? Voting or the right to vote should be treated as the most natural thing in a democracy. People should treat election not as an exceptional day for celebration but as the day on which they exercise their natural and fundamental right as citizens of a democracy. The elimination of the spirit of carnival from elections is, in fact, a reaffirmation of the spirit of democracy. It is a sign that Indian democracy is on the road to maturity. That maturity will be attained when the discipline does not emanate from the EC but from the consciousness of the people themselves.

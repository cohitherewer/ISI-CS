The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Letters to Editor

 Charged up

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Just a start? (Feb 27), which says that all right- thinking Indians will hail the Best Bakery convictions as a ?triumph of justice?, misses a vital point. The case had to be transferred to Maharashtra, a Congress-ruled state, before justice could be delivered. Gujarat, with a Bharatiya Janata Party government, failed to discharge its basic constitutional duties. Should the Gujarat government not be hauled up for such irresponsibility? Also, while one court of law exonerates all the accused, another court of the same level, severely punishes most of them on the same charge. If this trend continues, a time may come when criminals would ask for a transfer of their cases to a place where they think they will get a favourable judgment. Almost all the culprits in the mass killings of Sikhs in Delhi in 1984 have escaped punishment. Will the apex court consider reopening these cases in some opposition-ruled state? 

 Yours faithfully,

S.B. Gupta, Calcutta 

 Sir ? It is good to see the culprits in the Best Bakery case being dealt with an iron hand. The punishment might serve as a deterrent to those who indulge in communal violence. The lawmakers should come up with more stringent measures to root out communalism in India. But for that to happen, the country?s politicians have to stop being opportunistic. The power-hungry have to understand that only political stability can ensure their continued hold on power. And setting one community against another is hardly the best way to guarantee it. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arjun Chaudhuri, Calcutta

 Sir ? While the court verdict on the Best Bakery case would seem as if justice has been done, it leaves many questions unanswered. If the courts in Maharashtra are so impartial, why haven?t the people involved in the 1993 Bombay riots been convicted till date? Why is there no secularist pressure for justice in these cases? Initially, Zahira Sheikh was the prime witness and the case was shifted to the neighbouring state on her plea. She turned hostile later. Is there any guarantee that witnesses will not be tutored in subsequent cases, and not merely those involving the Gujarat carnage? 

 Yours faithfully,

Udita Agrawal, New Delhi

 Sir ? The special court?s verdict, sentencing nine rioters to life imprisonment in the Best Bakery case, will be heard beyond the country?s borders. It will prove to the international community, particularly to Muslims the world over, that the law in India is secular and that Muslims here are safer than in most other Islamic countries. 

 However, it goes without saying that in the Best Bakery case, Zahira Sheikh appeared to be guiltier than the rioters. How could she, after lodging a complaint on the basis of which 21 people were arrested in March 2002, turn hostile? She was the complainant and not merely a witness. Why was she not punished immediately after her volte face in the Gujarat court for lodging a false complaint? The failure to do this further emboldened her to retract her statements time and again. In other words, the perjury charges that Zahira Sheikh is going to face now should have come much earlier. She single-handedly kept the judicial system, the Muslim community and all progressive- minded people on tenterhooks for four years. Now, if she gets away unpunished or with a mild punishment, the justice delivered in the case will have little significance.

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta

 Sir ? The Mumbai session court?s perjury notice to Zahira Sheikh is laudable. This decision comes at a time when witnesses have been found to either change their statements or turn hostile (as in the case of Jessica Lal). This verdict brings to light the fact that not only the guilty, but also those who support them directly or indirectly, will be punished. 

 Yours faithfully,

Abhishek Law, Calcutta

 Sir ? Teesta Setalvad deserves accolades for pushing for the retrial of the Best Bakery case and thereby getting the accused persons convicted. This judgment may give another dimension to the Jessica Lal case, where all the accused persons have been acquitted. The public should bring more pressure on the government and judiciary so that proper justice is done to victims. The courts should ensure adequate protection for the witnesses so that they can exercise their freedom of expression without the fear of getting harassed or tortured by criminals. 

 Yours faithfully,

Mahjabeen Neshat Anjum, Gaya

 Back to front

 Sir ? The left?s endeavour to empower women members of the party by encouraging them to work as whole-timers is nothing but wishful thinking (?Let a thousand Brindas bloom?, Feb 26). Left history is replete with instances where women had to give in to the commands of their male comrades. In the Indian scenario, financial constraints in the family and domestic responsibilities are used as a smokescreen to trick the electorate and foster a gender bias. The left, for now, has only circulated booklets within the party. It has not taken any constructive step to increase the female ratio in the party leadership, even in places like Kerala and West Bengal. 

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Sir ? No party has used women as shamelessly as the left in India. Even the saffronites have women speaking from the pulpit. Not so for our comrades, who have not looked beyond the Brindas and Malinis.

 Yours faithfully,

N. Chatterjee, Calcutta

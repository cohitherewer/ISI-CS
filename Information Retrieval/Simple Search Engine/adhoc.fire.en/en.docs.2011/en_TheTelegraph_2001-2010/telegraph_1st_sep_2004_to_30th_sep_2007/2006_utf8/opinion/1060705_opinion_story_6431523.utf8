 Letters to Editor

 Too little, too late

 Sir ? The prime minister?s announcement of a relief package for the farmers of Vidarbha after a large number of suicides in the region, is a typical instance of bolting the stable doors after the horse has fled (?Cash, but no loan waiver?, July 2). A democratic government is supposed to act with only the people?s interests in mind. Peoples? representatives in the Lok Sabha are there to keep a tab on the state of affairs in their constituencies and make it known to the Central government, so that preventive action can be taken in time. Since legislators and the ministers from Maharashtra have failed pitiably in this regard, they deserve to be stripped of their respective positions and portfolios.

Yours faithfully, 

C.V. Krishnamoorthy,Bangalore 

 Sir ? If agriculture in Vidarbha has become excessively dependent on the monsoon, it is because there is no adequate infrastructure to support the farmers. Moreover, since a large part of the population is illiterate, farmers are not aware of the government schemes created to help them. Moneylenders exploit this weakness and charge exorbitant interests on loans. The situation has worsened to such an extent that it is now almost impossible to help the farmers with any amount of monetary compensation. Manmohan Singh?s visit to Vidarbha and the disbursal of relief packages to farmers? families are not going to solve the region?s long standing problems. Without fixing the rate of interest on loans and implementing a proper irrigation system, there can be no end to farmers? woes.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The relief package announced by the prime minister can only be a temporary solution for Vidarbha?s farmers. Their condition will revert back to the same next year. It is not that the farmers do not work hard but, unfortunately, they get very little in return for their labour. The production cost is high, while the selling prices of agricultural produce low. The farmers are forced to take loans in order to survive and the moneylenders exploit their helplessness. Unless the government comes to their aid, farmers will continue to die. The moneylenders should be punished and farmers? interests protected.

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Justice done

 Sir ? The three accused in the Akshardham temple attack four years ago have rightly been served the death penalty (?Death for terror trio? July 2). The only way to counter terrorism is to suppress it with an iron hand. Terrorists targetting religious centres not only kill harmless devotees but spread communal violence. Such acts deserve no clemency and there is no use in following a soft policy towards their perpetrators. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Kaushik Sen, Calcutta

 Sir ? Javed Khan Pathan, the lawyer defending Chand Khan, who is one of the accused in the Akshardham case, has said that he would move the Supreme Court to prove that his client is innocent. This is a reprehensible attempt to defend the indefensible by the exploitation of the judicial procedure. The stand taken by the temple authorities in this respect is commendable. Indeed, the temple administration has nothing to say if a lawyer tries to defend a criminal. The Akshardham attack was one of the most dastardly acts in recent times which killed and injured several. It was also an attack on the fundamental right to religious freedom guaranteed by the Constitution and an assault on India?s secular image. The government should involve religious leaders from all communities in framing a policy that will protect the rights of the believers of all faiths. 

 Yours faithfully, 

Surajit Das, Calcutta

 Home truths

 Sir ? The editorial, ?The gay science? (July 1), points to the difficulties in categorizing human sexual identity. Significantly, it once again draws attention to the fact that homosexuality is still a punishable offence under Article 377 of the Indian Penal Code. The IPC was based on the British penal code, which too has recently undergone amendments to make homosexuality legal. The British legislation has gone on to recognize ?civil union? between two homosexual partners. In response to the collective demand of homosexuals in India, a petition has been filed in the Supreme Court for the repeal of Article 377. The government, in return, has submitted an affidavit stating how societal mores in India make it necessary to retain the article. Let us hope the apex court realizes what is actually the Indian reality. 

 Yours faithfully,

Moni Nag, New York

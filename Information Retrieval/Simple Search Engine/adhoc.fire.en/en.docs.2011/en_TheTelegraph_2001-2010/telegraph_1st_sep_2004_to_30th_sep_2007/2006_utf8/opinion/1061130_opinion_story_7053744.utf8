 Letters to Editor

 Falling flat

 Sir The editorial, Bengalis flat earth (Nov 26), describes those opposing the takeover of agricultural land for industrial use as regressive and antediluvian. However, the people who are against the proposed automobile unit in Singur do not deserve such censure and the criticism has its roots in a skewed view of the problem. The protestors have no problems with the plans to industrialize the state. They are only saying that agricultural land should not be given up for industrial projects. Bidhan Chandra Roy started industrializing Bengal by utilizing barren tracts in and around Durgapur to set up the Chittaranjan Locomotive Works. Townships like Kalyani and Salt Lake have also come up on the marshlands in the fringes of Calcutta. Why cant Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee follow a similar policy now? Barren land, which can be used to set up industries, is still available in West Bengal. Depriving farmers of their source of livelihood to ensure the prosperity of industrialists is a strategy that will surely backfire on the Marxist government someday. 

 Yours faithfully,

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta 

 Sir It is unfair to describe Bengalis as retrogressive. A view that criticizes Bengalis for possessing such a mindset is invariably one that ignores the shortcomings of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee as a leader. Bhattacharjee has even failed to take his comrades along while devising grandiose plans to develop the state. The Left Fronts sudden decision to stall the West Bengal Land Reforms (Amendment) Bill, 2006, which would have relaxed the rural land ceiling, points out to the fact that the chief minister had not consulted his party colleagues on this matter. If Bhattacharjee fails in being transparent in his dealings with the members of the Front and that of the opposition, then he will lose their trust in a matter of days. And the people cannot be expected to lend their unquestioned support to the government if there are discordant notes within the ruling coalition. 

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir It is a fact that Bengalis resent change. They are indeed caught in a bizarre time warp, which does not allow them to accept the fact that the shift from agriculture to industry is essential for economic development. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is having a tough time convincing his partymen about the plans for industrial development. However, the sooner they realize their mistake, the better it would be for the future of the state. If the Tatas return from the state with empty hands, then other investors will think twice before setting foot in Bengal. West Bengal might then find itself lagging behind other states on the economic meter. 

 Yours faithfully,

R. Kumar, Calcutta 

 In the line of fire

 Sir The bomb blast in the New Jalpaiguri-Haldibari passenger train at Belakoba station brings to mind the attack on Mumbais local trains (10 killed in first state train blast, Nov 21). The bomb blast in Belakoba was also the handiwork of terrorist organizations, although it was less severe in terms of casualties. The police in Bengal suspect that the Ulfa helped the Kamtapur Liberation Organization carry out this audacious attack on the train. But it is useless to point fingers at insurgents after an attack takes place. If the security agencies were aware that such a strike could take place, why did they not take preventive steps to ward off the threat? Unfortunately, it is this callous attitude that has made India a soft target in the eyes of terrorists. They only have to exploit the loopholes in the security apparatus in order to target civilians. The money invested on upgrading the security gadgets after every attack is a waste because the police are incapable of utilizing them effectively. The only way to push the unwilling policemen into action would be by punishing them severely for their dereliction of duty. 

 Yours faithfully,

Jayantabishnu Mukherjee, Calcutta 

 Sir The blast at Belakoba proves yet again that the Indian railways is not bothered about the security of passengers. The railway protection force is always outmanoeuvred by those who want to cause bloodshed, be it terrorists or armed robbers. The railway minister, Lalu Prasad, is no different from the officials in his ministry. He spends his time lecturing about improving rail services but has no time to address the issue of passengers safety. 

 Yours faithfully,

Santanu Basu, Malda

 Parting shot

 Sir The report, House of horror for kids (Nov 21), coming only a few months after the implementation of the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, exposes the shortcomings of legislations in India. The three rescued children had been kept in confinement and forced to work without wages by a Faridabad businessman. Not only that, the children had also been tortured by their employer. It is shocking to note that the accused is roaming free even though there is ample evidence of his crime. However, the fact remains that arresting the man is not going to solve the problem of the childrens rehabilitation. It would be unfair to expect the children to take care of themselves at this age. The government has failed to eradicate child labour in India. However, it should at least try and rehabilitate these three children so that they could start a new life.

 Yours faithfully,

Surajit Das, Calcutta

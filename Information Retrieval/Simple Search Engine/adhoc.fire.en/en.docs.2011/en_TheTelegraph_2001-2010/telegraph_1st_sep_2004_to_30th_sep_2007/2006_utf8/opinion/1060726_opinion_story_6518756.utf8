 Letters to Editor

 Mission possible 

 Sir ? The real hero in the rescue operation of six-year-old Prince is the child himself. He hardly lost his composure in a situation in which older people would have died of panic (?Prince fall in unprotected well?, July 24). Through minute by minute coverage of the happenings on site, the media helped in directing public sympathy towards the boy and even decided the course of events to some extent. Perhaps it is because of the media glare that the local members of parliament and the chief minister of Haryana, Bhupinder Singh Hooda, appeared on spot to offer support to the rescue team. At least for once, politicians did more than what they do in such situations ? make perfunctory comments when things are over. 

 The rescue operation was well planned, but it could have been executed more efficiently. The team took too long to make the 60-feet deep connecting tunnel. One wonders if the presence of the media and politicians was responsible for slowing down the operation.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The entire country watched the rescue operation of Prince with bated breath. However, television channels made brisk business by keeping people glued to their sets with their live telecast of the happenings. They urged people to send messages on the mobile expressing their opinion, thus enabling mobile companies to make quick money. The visual media should stop exploiting popular sentiment, especially in such delicate situations.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? One wonders if the constant media attention in Prince?s case was desirable. The television channels kept themselves busy with a direct commentary of the event, as if they had no other news to cover. Prayers at various shrines by prominent people for the safe retrieval of the boy got special notice. The day after, there were front page pictures of the child. True, the efforts at saving a young life are newsworthy. But in India there are hundreds of similar accidents happening every day. Some end in tragedy, some happily. Most of them go unnoticed by the media. Perhaps what made the media go to such unusual lengths in this case was the fact that it had no bomb blast, scam or sex scandals to report that day.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The positive role that the media can play in society came to the fore when it went out of the way to give a detailed coverage of the plight of Prince and his subsequent rescue. It helped unite a nation divided by communal hatred. The day long presence of the chief minister of Haryana, the local MP, Naveen Jindal, and the former chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, Digvijay Singh, at the spot is unprecedented in India. The anxiety of the prime minister over Prince?s safety indicates that even those in the highest rungs of power care for the people. 

 The army proved its efficiency once again. But neither the skill of the army nor the resilience of the boy should distract one from what caused the accident. Had the well dug two months ago by the Haryana health department not been left uncovered, the child would not have had the fall. Such instances of civic negligence abound in India. It is Prince?s destiny that he should live when others in similar situations have died.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The untiring efforts of the army in rescuing Prince deserve accolades. The media also needs to be congratulated for keeping the public abreast of the happenings. The incident is significant because it reminds one that if human beings can kill, they can also come together to save a life. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The Haryana government owes it to the nation to initiate an inquiry to find out the persons responsible for the negligence of duty that led to Prince?s fall into the abandoned pit. They should be punished and made to compensate Prince?s family. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? After the recent brickbats, Prince?s rescue has given the army a chance to salvage its image. It is one of the most successful peacetime operations of the army. The concern the soldiers have shown for the child has once again strengthened our confidence in the army.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? It is difficult to overlook the fact that it took 50 hours to retrieve a child from 60 ft well. In this context, it seems a irony that India should boast of being an emerging economic and military superpower, which spends billions of rupees in developing state-of-the-art missiles and supersonic jets.We have been dubbed a ?software powerhouse?. A manned mission to Mars is also being considered. What a pity then that six-year-old Prince had to suffer 50 hours in unbearable conditions inside the well. If anything, this exposes the country?s lack of preparedness for disasters. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Shankar Pandey,

 COMRADE CHAIRMAN

 The Maoists are talking of joining an interim government in Nepal. So has Nepali Maoist leader Prachanda betrayed the revolution? 

 The young girl had travelled a long way to attend the rally. She was simply overwhelmed not only by the size of the crowd at Kathmandus Ratna Park but also by all the songs, dances and speeches that celebrated the Maoists victory. It was early June and the pro-democracy movement in Nepal had all but overthrown the absolute monarchy, thanks mainly to the Maoists. 

 But Kamala, still in her teens, had one regret. She, like many of her friends who had come to the rally from their village in Nuwakot district, some 50 km west of Kathmandu, had hoped to see Comrade Prachanda for the first time. A large portrait of the chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) next to the dais seemed to be surveying the crowd and presiding over the rally. But the 52-year-old leader never turned up, thereby disappointing thousands like Kamala. 

 Only two days back, some 2,000-odd people in a small village in Makwanpur, only a few kilometres south of Kathmandu, had better luck. Not only did the Maoist boss of Nepal surface there at a public meeting; his old father was brought there to meet him after six long years. 

 The legend of Prachanda derives its sustenance partly from the fact that the man behind the Maoist peoples war in Nepal has rarely been seen even by most of those who have fought and died at his call. Some Maoist leaders appeared in public during earlier spells of ceasefire. But Prachanda has been somewhat like God whom one does not see and yet believes in. 

 Puspa Kumar Dahal that is Prachandas real name has been underground much before the party he now heads was born. No one knows for sure how long that is. Some say Prachanda has been underground since 1978, when he was only 24. In the history of ever-splitting communist parties in Nepal, he has found himself in one faction or the other until he, Dinanath Sharma and Baburam Bhattarai formed the Maoist party to launch the peoples war in 1996. His brief stint as a school teacher in his native Bharatpur in Chitwan district came to an abrupt end. 

 Hundreds of their cadre and supporters, however, thought the protracted peoples war, modelled on Che Guevaras and Mao Zedongs theories of guerrilla warfare, would usher in a real revolution and eventually peoples democracy. After 10 years of partisan wars that claimed over 13,000 lives, that goal seemed not too far away when the 18-day pro-democracy movement last May took away almost all powers of King Gyanendra and forced him to restore parliament and re-instate prime minister, Girija Prasad Koirala. 

 But what is in all this for the Maoists? Now that they are talking of joining an interim government, does it mean they have betrayed the revolution? The Indian Maoists, who had pinned great hopes on the Nepali comrades with whom they had shared ideas, arms and much more, are clearly crestfallen. 

 The first time Prachanda surfaced after the victory of the pro-democracy movement was when he arrived in Kathmandu to discuss with Koirala the terms of the ceasefire. At the end of a long series of meetings at the prime ministers residence, Prachanda and Bhattarai addressed a press conference. 

 Is this the end of the peoples war? This was the most important question Prachanda faced at his first-ever press conference. And, it has remained the most frequently asked question ever since. 

 For the Indian Maoists, though, the answer is unambiguous. The Nepali leader, according to them, has failed the revolution; worse, he has proved himself a renegade. In the latest issue of the Peoples March, the organ of the Communist Party of India (Maoist), Azad, the partys spokesman, has poured scorn and anger on Prachanda. 

 The Nepali Maoists betrayal shows, according to Azad, in his hobnobbing with the CPM, which is a party of Indian ruling classes and whose primary task is to bring the Nepali Maoists into the parliamentary mainstream. The reference clearly is to the role the CPI(M) leader, Sitaram Yechuri, played, albeit with New Delhis blessing and active support, in order to persuade the Nepali Maoists to sign the 12-point agreement with seven democratic parties of Nepal last November. Azad describes Yechuri as the true Chanakya and a stooge of Indian expansionists. 

 To that charge Yechuri has a cryptic, almost dismissive answer. It is up to the Indian Maoists whether they will learn from history and from the latest happenings in Nepal. His party, though, has been waging an ideological battle against the Indian Maoists for quite some time. That is in addition to the use of police and para-military forces against the Maoists by Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government. 

 The late secretary of the CPI(M)s Bengal unit, Anil Biswas, started the ideological campaign in a pamphlet that was widely circulated among the Marxist cadre. Biswas called the Indian Maoists anarchists and dismissed their claim to uphold the ideas of Marx, Lenin or Mao. In the August issue of Marxvadi Path, the ideological journal of the Bengal unit of the CP(M), Dipak Dasgupta, member of the partys state secretariat, terms the Maoists agents of reactionaries. 

 Internal ideological witch hunts are part of communisms history. But it still does not answer the question whether the Nepali Maoists have really ended their peoples war. Most analysts do not believe that the Maoists in Nepal have come this far only to share power with parties like the Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist). Dinanath Sharma has a quizzical answer to the question. The peoples war does not mean only gun fire. It continues even within the government. It can actually supplement the government. 

 That may not be music to the ears of Indias Maoists. But communists in Nepal, India or elsewhere are never short on rhetoric.

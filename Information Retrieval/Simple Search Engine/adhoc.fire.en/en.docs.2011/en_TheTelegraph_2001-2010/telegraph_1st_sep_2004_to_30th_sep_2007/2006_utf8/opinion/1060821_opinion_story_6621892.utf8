 Letters to Editor

 Futile mission

 Sir The tragic death of Soumik Basu, a third year electrical engineering student of the Bengal Engineering and Science University, as a result of campus violence reminds one of the fact that education in West Bengal can never be free from politics (Victim of varsity clash dies in hospital, Aug 13). It is sad to see that an institution of academic excellence has been turned into a battlefield of student politics, backed by various political parties. Why should students coming to study engineering be more interested in politics than in their syllabi? It is true that a students body is needed to address student grievances. The problem arises when there is more than one such body with diverse political affiliations. Clashes among the unions not only put students lives in danger but also give a bad name to academic institutions. The bandh called by the Students Federation of India on August 14 served no purpose other than further politicizing the incident. 

 Yours faithfully,

Anurag Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir There were no unions in Besu in the late Forties and early Fifties. But that did not stop students grievances from being addressed by the teaching community. If the present day context makes students unions indispensable, then care should be taken to keep them free of political colours. Soumik Basu died a victim of campus violence and now the unions are blaming each other for his death. No matter how much shock the university vice-chancellor, Nikhil Ranjan Banerjea, may express over the death, he cannot deny the fact that, ultimately, it is the university administration that has failed to control the situation in the campus. There should be a judicial inquiry into the incident to prevent more students from falling victim to campus clashes.

 Yours faithfully,

C.R. Bhattacharjee, Calcutta 

 Sir Vice-chancellors of universities in West Bengal are selected not on the basis of their academic record but on the basis of their proximity to the mandarins of Alimuddin Street. So they do not care to take action against criminals masquerading as students who hang around the universities as dadas of the unions. If gullible students, who are taken in by the lectures of these goons, end up Soumik Basus way, then it is time that unions were banned in universities and colleges.

 Yours faithfully,

Tapan Das Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir Besu has been witness to frequent cases of indiscipline, largely due to the failure of the administration to curb campus violence. Most of the brawls are caused when students misbehave under the influence of alcohol. The day Soumik Basu died, Dipanjan Soren, another student, was arrested for hurling stones in a drunken state. The university authorities have to come down heavily on such raucous conduct

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

 Sir The unfortunate death of Soumik Basu is not unusual, given the culture of violence that the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has helped to bring about in West Bengal. The college unions might blame each other and the public might blame the administration of the university, but the real fault lies with the ruling political party that has failed to contain anarchy in the state.

 Yours faithfully,

Sunil Kumar Pal, London 

 Sir There must be an investigation into Soumik Basus fatal fall from the second floor of a hostel. Students indulge in violence nowadays because they have the support of the politicians who promise them a safe haven. The bandhs called by students wings of political parties serve no other purpose than covering up such misdeeds.

 Yours faithfully,

Tusar Kanti Kar, Howrah

 Sir Soumik Basus death was an accident. But the violence could have claimed some other lives too that day. The strike called by the SFI to protest Basus death is sheer gimmick. Against whom or what was the strike directed? Students affiliated to the SFI are often at the helm of disruptive activities in colleges. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bappa Pal, Calcutta

 Sir Is student politics a necessary part of academic life in a functioning democracy? It is only in states where human rights are routinely violated that universities and educational institutions become hotbeds of protests, as had happened in the pre-independence era in India. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sumit Majumdar, Calcutta

 Sir Death is a reality to be endured by those who survive, as Soumik Basus parents must be doing now. Basu would have had a bright career had he not ventured into politics. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Datta, Calcutta

 Sir We are the people our mothers warned us against. This graffiti on a college wall aptly sums up the situation in tragedies like that of Soumik Basu. Students politics today hardly concerns itself with addressing social disharmonies. Rather, it is the union elections that must be won at any cost. With Basus death, yet another student falls victim to this dirty world of students politics. 

 Yours faithfully,

Partho Roy, Calcutta

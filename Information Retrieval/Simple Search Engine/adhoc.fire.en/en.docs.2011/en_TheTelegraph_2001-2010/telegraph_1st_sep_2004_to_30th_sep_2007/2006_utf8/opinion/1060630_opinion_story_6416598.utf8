 FARMED OUT

 Major changes in any sphere stir up passions. More so if the changes threaten traditional livelihoods of the people. There is nothing unusual, therefore, about the controversies that surround the West Bengal government?s moves to acquire large tracts of land for its new industrialization drive. In fact, several state governments face similar situations as they prepare to move from an agrarian to an industrial economy. The recent violence in Orissa at the sites of new steel and mining projects is a case in point. But even those who oppose the Bengal government?s move to acquire land for the Tata group?s automobile project in Singur cannot deny the need for new industrial ventures in the state. The investment proposals that are now coming to the state are actually a recognition of the changed economic outlook for Bengal under Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. It is one thing for the government or the political parties to debate the suitability of a particular site for an industrial project; it is quite another to miss the big picture. At a time when state governments are competing with one another to woo investments, indecisive policies will not do a state any good. In Bengal, it would be even worse if overzealous leftists are seen to be stalling Mr Bhattacharjee?s moves. 

 Of course, the interests of agriculture and farmers need to be protected. It would be suicidal for any government to sacrifice food security at the altar of industrialization. It is understandable that the Bengal government is anxious to avoid acquiring multi-crop land for industrial uses. It is equally important to ensure that farmers do not lose their homes along with their plots of land. Also, the government needs to see to it that land-losers get their compensation on time. Yet, the time has come to ask the bigger question about the uses of land. No economy remains a land-based one for ever. In fact, the economic backwardness of Bengal is to be attributed largely to the slow and inadequate growth of industrial and commercial enterprises. The time has come to accept that agricultural success alone is unable to transform the state?s economy; nor is agriculture able to provide enough employment. On the contrary, over-dependence on land is taking its toll on farm production and productivity. Not small, tentative steps but big leaps are what Bengal needs in order to radically change its economy.

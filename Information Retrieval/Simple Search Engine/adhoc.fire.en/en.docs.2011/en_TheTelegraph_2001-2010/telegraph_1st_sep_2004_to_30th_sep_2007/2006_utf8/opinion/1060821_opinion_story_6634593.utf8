 WATER CRISIS

 Faith is meant to be a leap in the dark. But sometimes that darkness is simply a state of benightedness. When thousands of men, women and children rush to drink and collect sea-water from a particularly filthy section of the coast because the water has miraculously turned sweet, then it is difficult to feel anything but grave concern for the bodies and souls of these believers. This is what is happening near the Mahim Creek in central Mumbai and, on a lesser scale, in Valsad on the Gujarat coast. Such is the collective passion with which this miracle is being responded to that the state administration has had to call in the police, together with getting scientists and doctors to issue repeated warnings which have gone unheeded. These bits of the coast, into which industrial waste and urban sewage are regularly drained, are perhaps the most polluted in the country. Yet people are knowingly risking gastro-enteritis and lead-poisoning, among other things, to be cured by this water, and even forcing infants to drink it.

 It is difficult not to be fascinated by the extent to which notions of the symbolically sacred and the miraculously curative or purifying remain at odds with the actual conditions of cleanness and hygiene in India. The relations between purity and danger are complex here, and determined largely by ignorance and superstition that cut across levels of education. People do not seem to mind faecal matter or arsenic in the water they drink, and deadly gases in the air they breathe, provided the pesticide levels in their soft drinks are internationally approved. This contradiction would have been anthropologically interesting if it had not led to frequent outbreaks of unmanageably self-destructive collective adult behaviour in the country.

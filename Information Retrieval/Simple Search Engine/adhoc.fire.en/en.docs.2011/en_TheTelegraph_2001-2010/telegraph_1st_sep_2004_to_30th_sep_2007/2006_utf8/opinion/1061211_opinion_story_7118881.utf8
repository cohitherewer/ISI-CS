 Troubled history

 Sir About sixty years ago, India was divided in two and only on the basis of religion (Pak rewrites Partition page, Dec 8). The Muslim League, with Muhammad Ali Jinnah at the helm, propounded the theory that Muslims were a separate nation and as such, should have a nation of their own. They reached their goal through one of the worst mayhems in world history, in which thousands of people, Hindus and Muslims, suffered unimaginable horrors. For all of the post-Partition period, no one said that Muslims wanted a separate country because they were economically deprived.

 The Pakistani authorities and history textbook-writers should remember that before independence, the British, and not Hindus, were ruling the country. The British should be held responsible for the deprivation, if any, of the Muslims. The question also arises as to why Muslims apprehended that they would remain deprived even after independence. A final twist is the apparent coincidence of Pakistans new theory of origins and the Sachar committees report that Muslims are the most deprived lot in India. Is it all a part of a bigger and more sinister scheme to divide the country once more by earmarking another portion of it for the deprived ones? 

 Yours faithfully,

S.B. Gupta, Calcutta 

 Sir One can rewrite history books but cannot change history. The two-nation theory, propounded by V.D. Savarkar (for the Hindus) and M.A. Jinnah (for the Muslims), was never acceptable to India. Pakistan has woken up to the absurdity of the concept at last and tried to camouflage it by using the Muslim deprivation theory to justify Partition. Deprivation has been the lot of both Hindus and Muslims prior to Independence. The Partition only ensured that the cycle of feudalism and deprivation continued on either side of the border. But isnt it better to undo the past mistake in silence than concoct a new excuse for it? The concept of freedom of land imposed on the masses by the landed gentry of yore has been rejected in favour of the economic freedom of individuals. A bonding of the south Asian countries, somewhat in the steps of the European Union, could undo many mistakes of the past.

 Yours faithfully,

Md. Aslam Parvez, Calcutta

 Sir Biased interpretation of history in books and other media, on both sides of the border, has contributed to the building of perceptions, mostly untrue and unnecessary. In our slow progress towards a more responsible and tolerant society, small but significant efforts to create individuals without prejudices deserve much appreciation. It is a great move for Pakistan to change its history textbooks and say that it was Muslim deprivation and not religion that led to the Partition. But if it could be referred to as deprivation of the minorities, it would offer more food for thought to young minds. They would then begin to think how this is the case with many nations, including Pakistan. Self-criticism is necessary to free oneself of prejudice. With a little effort and an honest intent, Indians and Pakistanis can stop re-writing their troubled history and look at each other as human beings and not demons. 

 Yours faithfully,

Payoshni Mitra, Calcutta

 Sir Pakistans decision to re-write history appears welcome at first glance. However, Pervez Musharrafs real intentions emerge as one probes deeper. To begin with, how would the new theory undo the discourses promoting extremism and militancy in Pakistan? If the contention that social and economic deprivation of Muslims in undivided India was the main reason behind the Partition were true, the British ought to be blamed for it. Then, M.A. Jinnah, et al could have waited some years after Independence and checked if Muslims were still deprived in free India. Musharraf is blaming the majority Hindus of undivided India for depriving Muslims socially and economically. By the same logic, Muslims can also be blamed for the deprivation of Hindus in the Muslim-dominated areas that are now in Pakistan and Bangladesh. In other words, Hindu-Muslim hatred would still remain in Pakistani textbooks. Also, Musharraf intends to incite Indian Muslims by telling them that they have always been deprived by the Hindus. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Parting shot

 Sir Ashok Mitra pays a few left-handed compliments to the Nobel laureate, Milton Friedman, for his lifetime achievements in the field of economics (Choose your epithet, Dec 8). The late Friedman, as Mitra says, is best known for his views on monetary policy. He was indeed a monetarist par excellence. He was firm in his belief that monetary policy can shape an economy better than fiscal or budgetary policy. In India, the Reserve Bank, which sets the monetary policy, is not altogether independent but functions, by and large, as an appendage to the finance ministry. But Mitra does not mention the fact that Friedman also believed that persistent high inflation would not lead to overall prosperity and could, in fact, result in lower living standards. In that light, Indias current rate of inflation, above 5 per cent, has to be viewed with deep concern. The finance ministers assurances notwithstanding, the rate of inflation has not been contained, and the resultant high prices have affected the most vulnerable sections of society.

 Yours faithfully,

K.R. Rangaswamy, Waunakee, US

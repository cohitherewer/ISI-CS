The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 SAYING IT AGAIN

 It is necessary sometimes to state the obvious. The prime minister, Mr Manmohan Singh, did not really say anything new when he ruled out any discussion on Assam?s ?sovereignty? with the outlawed United Liberation Front of Asom. Successive governments in New Delhi had insisted that any dialogue with the Ulfa or the two factions of the National Socialist Council of Nagalim could be held only within the framework of the Constitution. But Mr Singh?s statement in Guwahati is significant insofar as it makes the government?s position clear once more. Equally important is his remark that the boundaries of the states of the region would not be redrawn without the consent of the affected states. It is not difficult to see why Mr Singh chose to re-state the government?s positions. Clearly, he had to reassure the people of Assam that the state?s territorial integrity was as important to the Centre as its peace. Any impression to the contrary could be damaging for the Congress?s prospects in the assembly polls.

 It is possible that the Ulfa and the NSCN, particularly the faction led by Mr Isak Chishi Swu and Mr Thuingaleng Muivah, would be somewhat upset by Mr Singh?s statement. Despite their militant rhetoric, none of the groups really expects Assam or Nagaland to acquire a ?sovereign? status through peace talks. The NSCN(I-M)?s demand for the integration of all Naga-inhabited areas into a ?Greater Nagaland?, though, is more complicated. The outfit sees the idea as central to its concept of a Naga ?nation?. But it is also aware of the government?s predicament. For any move to carve out territories from other states in order to create a ?Greater Nagaland? would cause ugly backlashes in these states. That this is no idle speculation was proved by the violence in Imphal three years ago. However, Mr Singh?s statement should not be seen as an end to peace talks with the Nagas; nor should it stand in the way of similar initiatives with the Ulfa.

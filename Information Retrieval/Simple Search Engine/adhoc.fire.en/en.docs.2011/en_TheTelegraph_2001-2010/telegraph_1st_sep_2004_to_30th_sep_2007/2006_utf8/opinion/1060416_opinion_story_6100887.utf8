 Letters to Editor

 Surprise winner

 Sir ? I was surprised to see our postal department beat a private courier service in a race to deliver mail. Recently, I posted some letters through ordinary post, while I had a packet sent by First Flight Courier service to Hyderabad. The letters, bearing Rs 5 stamps, reached their destination a day earlier than the couriered packet that had cost me over a hundred rupees. Maybe, we ought to stop wasting our precious money believing in the ?efficacy? of private service providers. 

 Yours faithfully,

 K. Vizayakumar, Kharagpur

 Out of touch

 Sir ? Despite Virender Sehwag?s failure to score in his last 30 innings, Kiran More still thinks that he should play his ?natural game?. Sehwag?s body language clearly shows that his confidence is low. Sourav Ganguly was exactly in the same condition when he was dropped from the team. It is evident that Sehwag has not recovered from his back problem. Sehwag is in the team because he is the vice-captain and the financial stakes are now too high for any player to miss a few games. But there cannot be different yardsticks to judge performance ? one for Ganguly and another for Sehwag. He should be dropped for the remaining one day international against England and young players like Wasim Jaffer or Robin Uthappa must be given a chance. If Gautam Gambhir can be dropped after one bad performance, why is Sehwag being tolerated ?

 Yours faithfully, 

 R.B. Easwaran, Chennai 

 Sir ? Virender Sehwag should stop deciding on the composition of the future Indian team and concentrate on his batting instead (?Past (Sourav) is past, says Sehwag?, April 12). To start with, he could aim at achieving at least 50 per cent of what Sourav Ganguly had accomplished for himself and the team. Unless he does that, he is unlikely to be on the mind of Guru Greg when the latter decides on the team for the World cup to be held in the West Indies. The cricketer could also try and be more supportive of his former mentor, without whom he would not have reached where he is today.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Gagan Chawla, Calcutta 

 Sir ? No matter how much he revises his statement, Virender Sehwag?s comment about Sourav Ganguly was in bad taste. Sehwag should have remembered that he is in the Indian squad because of Ganguly, and that he was talking about the most successful Indian captain who has more than 10,000 runs in oneday cricket. Ganguly gave up the opening slot to facilitate Sehwag?s entry in the side. It is obvious that his comments about the former Indian captain were made to keep his benefactors happy.

 Yours faithfully, 

 Kalyan Ghosh, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Virender Sehwag has probably forgotten that modern day cricketers are fully aware of the strengths and weaknesses of the opponent camp, thanks to technology. So his batting technique, or the lack of it, stands exposed. Sehwag?s weakness before short-pitched deliveries seems to haunt him. His belief that runs ought to be scored only in boundaries and sixes has proved fatal to his career. Sehwag?s dismal footwork and his lack of patience may result in his ouster from the team. He has not paid much attention to his fitness either. He should learn from players like Ricky Ponting, Adam Gilchrist, Sunil Gavaskar, Sachin Tendulkar, Vivian Richards, Clive Lloyd and so on. All of them were accumulators of runs minus Sehwag?s weaknesses. 

 Yours faithfully,

N. Hattiangadi, Jamshedpur

 GOOD OMEN

 Better late than never, and better this than nothing. Such could be the small consolation from the long-delayed birth of the South Asian Free Trade Agreement. Ten years after the idea was first mooted in 1996, the Safta finally came into effect last Saturday. The importance of a free flow of commerce had, however, been routinely mentioned at every summit of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation. If the Safta took all these years to materialize, the reason was that the Saarc had failed to emerge as an effective regional bloc for multilateral cooperation. As is well known, that failure was primarily because of strains in the bilateral relations between India and Pakistan. Smaller countries in the Saarc have always attributed the forum?s failure to this and they were not off the mark. The birth of the Safta too has been clouded by the strains in the India-Pakistan relations. Neither India nor other countries in the region would, therefore, be surprised at Islamabad?s decision not to extend to New Delhi the advantages of the Safta. And Pakistan has not kept it a secret that its decision has nothing to do with the economics of international trade. Predictably, its decision, as Pakistan?s commerce minister, Mr Humayun Akhtar Khan, has said, is linked to its perception of the Kashmir issue. 

 Yet, it is a beginning that should infuse fresh blood in south Asian trade and help bolster the region?s economy. There are many factors that have made south Asia one of the two poorest regions in the world ? the other being sub-Saharan Africa. But unrealistic tariff and non-tariff barriers are a major hurdle on the region?s economies. Unfortunately, the region has also seen long spells of political instability. Domestic problems of countries such as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal have added to the larger conflicts between India and Pakistan. The absence of free trade has resulted in large-scale smuggling across the borders and massive losses of revenues for the governments of these countries. It is a good omen for the Safta that Bangladesh has come forward with its schedule of reducing tariff rates in accordance with the agreement. After all, the reduction in tariff rates will help consumers in each of these countries. True, several of these countries have bilateral trade agreements among themselves. But a strong regional identity has greater advantages.

 A SORRY EXAMPLE UP THERE

 Malvika Singh

 Uttar Pradesh ? a state that elects the single largest number of members of parliament and equally the state that represents corruption and criminality in the public space. This region was once synonymous with culture, sophistication, graciousness, poetry, literature and philosophy, with human creativity and skills, with vibrant cities and dynamic architecture. Today, as one drives through the state capital of Lucknow, one can catch a fleeting glimpse of the last vestiges of a layered tradition. To see the ruthless destruction of UP because of decades of maladministration and political exploitation is depressing and a sharp reminder that a similar fate could befall almost all the states of India if this corrupted form of governance continues without check.

 The poverty, ten minutes outside Lucknow, is indescribable. It is inhuman and brutal. In other states, if you drive out into the periphery of a town or city, you do not encounter this desperate reality. Driving two hours away from Indore in Madhya Pradesh, into the Nimar countryside over potholed roads, there is a comparative economic boom. There has been unrecognizable change over the last decade. Not so in UP. The plight of people here is pathetic and unwarranted 60 years after independence. It is a living example of corruption and exploitation indulged in by the political rulers and administrators. There can be no economic mobility, no intelligent and innovative intervention, no positive input without addressing the real and primary problem ? the quality of leadership and governance, of the reality of muscle, money and criminal power. Small wonder that the colloquialism used to describe UP is ?badlands?. For decent humans to survive in this environment, let alone be productive and generate wealth, is near impossible. Anarchy runs riot for there can be no other option.

 Lay the bed right

 In Delhi, the centre of national governance, it is a similar story, a story of impropriety and therefore citizen shame. Ministers and senior administrators allow and sometimes endorse illegalities and corrupt practices, turn a blind eye to tainted and base truths. When questioned about their arbitrary actions, they too harass the dissenting individual by arbitrarily wielding and thereby abusing state power. This has made the ?authority? inappropriate and immoral in the eyes of the hitherto silent and patient public. To relentlessly badger, prod and insult civil society is bound to have unsavoury repercussions in the future. Social strife, lawlessness and anarchy are inevitable as the misuse of power continues to intervene dictatorially with no accountability in the world?s largest democracy. Is this the manner in which to govern and nurture a democracy with intellectual and other freedoms that are intrinsic to the framework of democratic processes? The new generation will not tolerate this rampant exploitation. There is bound to be an explosion.

 For many, Manmohan Singh epitomizes the demeanour, integrity and dignity that should be the attributes of a national and regional leader. With him being anointed prime minister there was hope that he would redress this overwhelming disease that had begun to gnaw at the root of our civilization. Many months down the line, we continue to wait for his action on this fundamental reality. Economic and social protocols, international partnerships will come to nought if the all-consuming malaise of corruption is not tackled. No initiative can take root and grow positively in this polluted and infected environment. Every intervention is wasted as an inept administration stalls restoration to save its own skin. Manmohan Singh should commit his time to this cleansing and leave the endless tinkering with policy to his cabinet of ministers.

 For if the bed is not laid with care, nothing will take root. Nothing will change. Nothing will grow.

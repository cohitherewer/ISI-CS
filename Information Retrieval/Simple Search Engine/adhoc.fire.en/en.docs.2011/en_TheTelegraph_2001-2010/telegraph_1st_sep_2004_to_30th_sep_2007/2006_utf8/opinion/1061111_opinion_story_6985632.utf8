 COURTING TROUBLE

 Ram Jethmalani has taken plunges few others in his profession have dared to even consider

 An unknown rock roll buff has been going around town since last week, passing on a joke that tends to border on the nasty. Contrary to popular belief, says the wit, Sympathy for the Devil Mick Jaggers cult 1968 anthem glorifying the Fallen Angel was not inspired by passages in Russian author Michail Bulgakovs classic The Master and Margarita. It was fuelled by the heretic ways of an Indian criminal lawyer who was then 45 and steadily earning a reputation for the special corner he had in his heart for all those on the wrong side of the law. 

 Ram Jethmalani is pushing 84 now an age mature enough for any ordinary human being to call it a day from work and retire to a pastoral life, counting either his money or the stars on a moonless night. But then, Jethmalani is no ordinary man. And that, perhaps, is the reason hes latched on, once again, to a case that is steeped in controversy, thereby inviting upon himself the collective public wrath of a nation. His choosing to defend Manu Sharma accused of killing model Jessica Lal in Delhi in 1999 and pronounced guilty by public conscience is being seen by many as the mans obsession with taking up cases that rock the pillars of judiciary, if not the nation. 

 In the past, Jethmalani who was born in Sindh, Pakistan has often gone to court shielding under his wing people thought to be guilty of some of the most critical offences committed on Indian soil. The list is long and includes those accused of killing former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, the Hinduja brothers, considered to be beneficiaries of kickbacks from the Bofors arms deal, aides of Dawood Ibrahim for their involvement in the 1993 Mumbai blasts, and S.A.R. Geelani, a Delhi University lecturer put in the dock for an alleged hand in the December 2001 attack on Parliament. Not that he has emerged victorious on all those counts but he has taken plunges which few others in his profession have dared to even consider. 

 His CV is impressive, even by the most stringent of standards. An alumnus of the Government College of Law, Karachi, the king of legalese ruled courtrooms both in Pakistan, where he first began practice, and India, where he moved after Partition. 

 He has consistently been a member of the Indian Parliament since 1977 he still rides a presidential nomination to the Rajya Sabha. In between, he has held important portfolios such as law and urban affairs in the Union government, managed to pen a couple of books on law, and jet-setted all across the world to teach legal basics to hundreds of aspiring lawyers of various nationalities. 

 No one has any doubts about his acumen. What is being questioned, however, is his dealings with matters of the heart. I have moral courage, he recently said in an interview to a TV channel regarding his decision to defend Manu Sharma. 

 Clearly, it is his legal preference that has come under criticism. But then, it is probably the bane of every criminal lawyer, who walks the fine line by leaving his conscience outside the courtroom. The legal codes call it professional duty and in obeying it, Jethmalani is perhaps only living up to what is expected of a good lawyer. 

 His philosophy is that a lawyer cant afford to prejudge a person before being tried in court, and would be failing in his duties as a lawyer if he did, says Pune-based journalist and writer Nalini Gera, who penned Jethmalanis biography in 2003. She says that she was surprised at his deciding to take up the Jessica Lal case. But then, he is a person who knows exactly what he is doing, so I guess he has his point. I have never known him to do anything irrational.

 His political sojourn, however, tells a different story. Many in the power corridors believe him to be a lone ranger obsessed with Parliamentarian status, who could go to any length to have it. He was an associate of the Bharatiya Janata Party, until he ran into trouble with the powers-that-be and had to yield his law ministry portfolio. He lost no time in crossing the floor before the 2004 general elections to warm up to the Congress despite the fact that he had always been a staunch critic of both Rajiv Gandhi and Indira Gandhi. And the man who wanted to be president even contested the elections unsuccessfully against then Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee from Lucknow. 

 Before his current term in the Rajya Sabha, Jethmalani known for his refined sartorial sense got a membership in the upper house under the aegis of the Shiv Sena. And then, there was a time when he was roughed up by Chandra Shekhars men, for his inclination to side with whoever was in power, after he had gone to congratulate their newly-elected prime minister. Evidently, his political journey has been as colourful as his career in a black cloak. 

 Some, however, have seen a problem with the fact that he decided to fight the case even after having made it quite clear that at his age, he would no longer take on cases unless absolutely necessary. He said he would only do cases which were of national importance, says Supreme Court lawyer and Jethmalanis colleague Kamini Jaiswal. How exactly does this case qualify as being one of such proportion?

 But as far as the legal eagle also an avid sports fan with a weakness for badminton is concerned, Manu Sharma remains innocent until proven otherwise. And for that, Jethmalani is currently out to prove that a tall Sikh person was the one who actually pulled the trigger on Lal. A classic dose of confusion to scuttle a possible conviction? Only time will tell. And time is definitely on his side.

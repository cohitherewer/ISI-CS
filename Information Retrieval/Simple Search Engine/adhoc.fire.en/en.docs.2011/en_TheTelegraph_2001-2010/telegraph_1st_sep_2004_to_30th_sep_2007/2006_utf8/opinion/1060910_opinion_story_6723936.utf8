The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 Himesh Reshammiya had better buck up. Vande Mataram is threatening to push his songs out of the charts, thanks entirely to the juvenile squabbling between the Congress and the BJP. If Sonia Gandhi decides to skip a meeting, then it must be because she is scared she would have to sing the national song or so goes the BJP logic. It is the Congressmens turn to chuckle when Arif Mohammed Khan, the BJPs minority mascot, shares the stage, and his views on the song, with Congress leaders. Typically of the Congress, its leaders have managed to use the song to pull down their in-house rivals Arjun Singh pleaded innocence before Madam and claimed that all his actions on the song were in accordance with the proposal of the Union culture ministry, incidentally headed by his archrival, Ambika Soni. But the BJP leaders again typically of a party with no worries of defending its throne made good use of the song on the Shatabdi Express while travelling to Dehra Dun to attend the partys national executive. As the train chugged out of Saharanpur, Gopinath Munde asked his brothers in saffron to join him in singing Vande Mataram. But he couldnt get past the first stanza himself. But help was at hand, in the form of Kirit Somaiya. He promptly switched on his laptop and played AR Rahmans version in full blast. Himesh Reshammiya shouldnt lose this opportunity to prove his patriotism, and genius.

 Babulal Gaur sure knows how to keep his people in good humour. The ex-chief minister and current trade and industry minister of Madhya Pradesh is now on a trip to China to promote his state as the new destination for investors. He is accompanied by a group of industrialists, but that is hardly unusual. What could raise a few eyebrows is that six of them belong to one locality Bairagarh which falls under the Govindpura assembly constituency. No prizes for guessing the name of the Govindpura MLA. Chambers of commerce and their members are outraged, but Gaur is not ashamed to have shown his love for his people.

 Why should all free lunches go to politicians? They dont. Some go to the bureaucrats too. Ram Prakash Bagai, Chhattisgarhs chief secretary, is enjoying a break in Austria and Germany, ostensibly in his capacity as the head of the Chhattisgarh Hockey Association. The Maoist problem in the state is quite grim, but Bagai probably feels that the state of Indian hockey is even grimmer. Hence, perhaps, the decision to skip the meeting of the chief ministers of Naxal-affected states called by the PM, in order to be able to accompany the Indian boys in search of the long-elusive hockey World Cup. It may be argued that Bagai is not travelling at the taxpayers expense, since the Indian Hockey Federation is paying for him. But isnt it the taxpayer whose money helps subsidize the game and its controlling body? Bagai has no reasons to feel insecure, though, being the blue-eyed boy of former cop and IHF boss, KPS Gill. Are you surprised that Gill has recently been appointed to advise the Chhattisgarh government on combating the Naxals?

 Ghulam Nabi Azad, away from the action in the capital, was merely trying to bring the hills alive with a spot of intrigue, when Madam put a spanner in his works. The Peoples Democratic Party, which shares power with the Congress in Jammu and Kashmir, had decided to remove its deputy chief minister, Muzaffar Ali Beig. But Azad, the chief minister, found it unacceptable. His ultimate aim was to engineer a split in the PDP. He had even got more than half of the PDP MLAs to support Beig. But Azad hadnt bargained for what happened next. PDP chief Mufti Mohammed Sayeed wasted no time to go to 10 Janpath and told the Congress president that one more interference from Azad and the PDP would part ways with the Congress. Madam immediately deployed Ahmad Patel to do the needful (which would be to give Azad a earful). Since then, Azad has been revising the chapters on coalition dharma.

 Whatever his ideological leanings, Narendra Modi is a management students delight. At all the CMs conclaves, it is Modi who walks away with accolades for the best power-point presentation, be it on development or law and order. The other day, he made his point before the prime minister that security forces should never put on kid gloves just because they are dealing with minority communities. Quite understandably, he made a far better impression on the security bigwigs than the PM, with his the minorities are insecure line. But were there ever any doubts about Modis forcefulness?

 Who would have expected a ranting political speech at a condolence meeting? But those like Uma Bharti revel in doing the unexpected. She landed from the blue at the memorial meeting for RSS pracharak and journalist Bhanu Pratap Shukla. And then, when the organizers were still wondering how to explain her presence to the BJP leaders in the auditorium, she wanted to speak. To the horror of most present, her speech had nothing to do with the departed soul, but mostly about her pet hate, LK Advani, and his role in the BJPs ideological shift. Now that she has decided to contest the Vidisha parliamentary seat, it may have been a clever ploy to kick-start her election campaign, right inside her opponents den. But the organizers were desperately trying to figure out how she had entered uninvited. And then it emerged that she had used the invitation sent to K. Govindacharya to gain entry. So she doesnt hate all of the BJP, then?

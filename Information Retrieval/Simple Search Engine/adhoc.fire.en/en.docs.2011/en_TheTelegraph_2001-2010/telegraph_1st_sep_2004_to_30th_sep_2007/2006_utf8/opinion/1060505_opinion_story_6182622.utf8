 ROAD TO NOWHERE

 A few villagers refusing to vote may make no difference to the election results. It may even work towards the greater glory of the winning parties, since India does not have a system in which the percentage of abstentions is taken into account. But there are ways of computing success and failure that exist outside of arithmetic. Around 850 villagers from a cluster of villages of Gouripur in Uluberia (South) administered a tiny prick to the swelling development rhetoric of the West Bengal government by boycotting the polls. They had waited 30 years for water and electricity to come to their area, and for proper roads. In retaliation to the government?s indifference, they sat down to a marvellous picnic on election day instead of going to the polling booths. Maybe Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee would be compelled to spare a thought for their children studying by the light of the lantern, just one-and-a-half hours away from Writers? Buildings. Or for the fact that 2,200 people use one tubewell. This was during the second phase of the vote, and was reflected neatly in a second similar boycott by all villagers across parties from three villages near Behrampore in Murshidabad in the fourth phase. They simply want a road leading to their villages, instead of the impassable dirt-track they have to use. Or not use, during the monsoons. And they are tired of asking, tired of being turned away, sometimes rudely. Their placards made the basic message very clear: first the road, then the vote.

 The contrast between the dream of an information-technology oriented, smoothly connected, thriving industrial region and the reality of pockets that lack even the basic necessities could not be greater. It is a contrast that demands to be acknowledged. If Bengal is changing, then such contrasts must be taken into account in order for the change to be truly meaningful. There is also a dimension beyond policy and politics. People, and their distress, need to be respected. That is the minimum that a professedly people-friendly government can do. Mr Bhattacharjee, if he has noticed these protests at all, may find a bright spot still. That the villagers are uniting irrespective of politics to speak out in his favourite language of development may also be a measure of his success. There is a lesson in it, if interpreted right.

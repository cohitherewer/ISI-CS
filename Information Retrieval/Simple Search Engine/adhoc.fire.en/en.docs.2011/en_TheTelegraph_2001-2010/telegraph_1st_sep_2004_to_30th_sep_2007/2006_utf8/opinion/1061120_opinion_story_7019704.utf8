 ON THE PATH TO RUIN

 GWYNNE DYER

 An equation has to be created in which it is not worth it for the Palestinians to fire, said Eli Moyal, mayor of Sderot, after rockets fired from the Gaza Strip killed a 57-year-old woman and severely injured two young men, last Wednesday in the southern Israeli town. The logic is impeccable: hurt the Palestinians enough, and they will have to stop launching those rockets.

 But the Israel Defense Force hurt the Palestinians very badly indeed at the beginning of November, in Beit Hanoun, the town nearest to the launch sites of last Wednesdays rockets. The operation lasted for a week, and it killed 60 Palestinians and injured 250. One Israeli soldier was killed. If that kill ratio doesnt stop the rockets, what will?

 Since the hopelessly inaccurate, homemade Qassams first began to fall on the towns and villages near the Gaza Strip in 2000, they have killed a total of only nine Israelis. In just four weeks, between June 26 and July 24 , the IDF actions in the Gaza Strip to stop the Qassam rocket fire killed 126 Palestinians. According to BTselem, the Israeli human rights organization, 63 of them were not fighters, and 29 of them were minors. The IDF says it never deliberately targets civilians, but it cannot be unaware that a high Palestinian death toll is a necessary part of the equation in which it is not worth it for the Palestinians to fire.

 So its operations are less careful than they would be if the civilians in question were Israelis. Consider, for example, the Israeli artillery fire that killed 19 members of the Athamna family in Beit Hanoun a few days after the armoured operation. A technical failure, said Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, and he was no doubt technically correct. But over 350 Palestinians have been killed in the Gaza Strip since mid-summer, versus two Israelis: one soldier killed in Beit Hanoun early this month, and one civilian killed in Sderot last Wednesday. 

 Turning point

 Yet no amount of pain seems to deter the Palestinians, and now the rockets are getting accurate enough to hurt Israelis. They are not as accurate as the modified Katyushas that Hizbullah fired on northern Israel last summer, but the ranges are a great deal shorter. Moreover, this is not taking place in the context of a war of limited duration, like the one last summer that was triggered by Hizbullahs seizure of two Israeli soldiers and then escalated by massive Israeli air raids on Lebanon. That lasted a month; this is an everyday affair of local people fabricating and launching short-range missiles at nearby Israeli targets, and it could go on for years. No doubt Israel can also go on attacking the Gaza Strip and making occasional armoured incursions for years. But the Palestinians just dont care any more. 

 That is not literally true. Of course they care when their family and friends are killed. But most Palestinians, at least in the Gaza Strip, no longer care how high the price is. This poses a deadly danger for Israel because it means that the traditional strategy of terrorizing the Palestinians into submission no longer works. 

 Turning points do not normally announce themselves. But this year, for the first time, Israel failed to win a war (in Lebanon). For the first time in 39 years, Israel has really lost control of the Palestinians. And now the United States of America, after 30 years of military involvement, is on its way out of the Middle East. The US withdrawal from Iraq is still a year or two away, but the retreat will not stop there.

 We are probably still twenty or thirty or even fifty years away from the day when Israel faces a real war for survival. Avoiding that is of high priority even for Israels enemies, for a defeated Israel would certainly destroy the Arab world with nuclear weapons before it went under, and probably much of Europe as well. That outcome is still far from inevitable, but this is the year when the clock started ticking.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIFFERENT HOUSE

 A principle can be subverted by unthinking use. Checks and balances built into any system help to make the system healthy, but when the powers behind these begin to operate indiscriminately, the system is put in danger. The debate over rights and duties, responsibilities and privileges, that has erupted around the issue of the parliament?s dismissal of the 11 legislators caught accepting money for questions is a case in point. For a nation grown cynical and despairing at the unchecked perpetuation of corruption and abuse of power among its elected representatives, the legislature?s quick action against the offenders came as some relief. The fact that the Delhi high court has accepted a case brought to it by eight of the dismissed members of parliament, and has posted a later date for the hearing, has not gone down well with the speaker and many other members. The judiciary and the legislature are two of the three mainstays of the Indian democracy, the third being the executive. The court has sent a notice to the Centre and to the parliament asking for an explanation of the dismissal. As envisaged by the makers of the Indian Constitution, the three segments of the democratic edifice are situated each in its well-marked terrain, with powers within its boundaries. They are complementary, not competitive, checking and balancing one another to keep the edifice in good shape.

 Such an ideal is often difficult in practice, especially in a vibrant and changing time. One of the major problems is the fact that the Constitution itself leaves much to be desired in terms of articulation; the vision is not always worked in black and white. But there are some boundaries that are obvious: the speaker?s argument that the courts have no jurisdiction in the matter of the dismissal in this case will have many takers. There should be no space for debate if the rights and privileges of parliament are clearly enunciated. This is not the first time that the judiciary and the legislature have come so close to direct conflict, only the occasion seems to be unprecedented. The situation is not merely unpleasant, it threatens a destabilization of the fundaments of India?s democratic structure. Any faint reassurance that the nation might have felt at the parliament?s decision would be dispersed immediately by the resultant confusion.

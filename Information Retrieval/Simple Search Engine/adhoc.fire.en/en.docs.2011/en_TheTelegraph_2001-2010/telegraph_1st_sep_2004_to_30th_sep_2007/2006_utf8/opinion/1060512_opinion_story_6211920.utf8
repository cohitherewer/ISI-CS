The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 SOUTH WIND

 Even with the ?rice war?, and computers for poor children, free gas and colour television sets for poor women, free electricity not only for farmers but also for weavers, and a whole series of other gifts showered upon the underprivileged by the two chief political parties of Tamil Nadu, the winning party is quite a bit short of outright majority. Be that as it may, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, led by Mr M. Karunanidhi, will be sitting in government. And Ms J. Jayalalithaa, with her All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam losing by more than 30 seats, has resigned as chief minister. The alternating pattern of voters? preferences in Tamil Nadu is fairly well known, arguing a deeply entrenched democratic reasonableness that is often in contrast with their politicians? displays of melodramatic unreason.

 These were not uninteresting times. Ms Jayalalithaa, accused of being autocratic, had been trying to contain the damage she had created by alienating the enormous population of government employees, for example, or by banning conversions. Her rival, accused of propagating dynastic rule, had to promise he would head the government should the DMK win. With the Congress in the coalition and the left parties supporting it, the 83-year-old Mr Karunanidhi will be able to create a mini, if refracted, image of the Centre in his state. There are some advantages in that, besides the fact that the Congress will be part of a government in Tamil Nadu for the first time since 1967. But in spite of the alternating pattern, many things have changed in the last 10 years. Traditional loyalties have shifted and split, and the main political groups can no longer rely on the votes of specific caste-community groups. For example, the AIADMK?s Thevar vote bank has split along regional lines, sticking by the party in the south, while going towards the DMK in the west and the Cauvery delta. The same social group may differ in preference from region to region. Perhaps it is a way of keeping political parties on their toes.

 - Footballs golden children

The Perfect 10: Footballs Dreamers, Schemers, 

Playmakers and Playboys 

By Richard Williams, 

Faber 9.10

 In front of young Williams, a team in black-and-white striped shirts is playing another in royal-blue-and-white quarters. It is almost impossible for the young boy to single out any one player in the cold, gloomy light, except for the dark-haired man of slight build, the home teams inside left. His passes are perfect, his ball-control extraordinary and his sense of the game immaculate. The mans name is Ron Wylie. Williams notices that the number sewn on the back of his jersey is 10.

 Wylie did leave an indelible mark on Williams. So much so that when he grew up, Williams wrote a book about eleven great footballers, all of whom sported the Number 10 shirt, to unravel the fact, legend and myth of the shirt number that encapsulates everything that excites about the beautiful game.

 If we were to look at history, we would find that the number 10 is not like any other numeral. It occupies a significant place among its fellow digits. For Pythagoras and his secret society of mathematicians, 10 was the number of the universe. The Ten Commandments, a perfect ten, the top-ten countdown, the ten o clock news, each, says Williams, is a very special term of reference. Therefore, it is impossible to look at the Number 10 shirt as another piece of clothing in football. It is both a blessing and a burden, and the people who have this number on their backs are no ordinary sportsmen. They, Williams writes, are an exotic species who have been integral to footballs evolution and progress.

 A Number 10 goes by many names. In England, he is the playmaker and the pibe doro (the golden child) in Italy. And as a type, he emerged gradually, reflecting the changes that the game underwent. He was the inside left, the games tactical foundation, a ploy that was used by English clubs and the Uruguay national side to devastate opponents during the Fifties. The inside left held on to his position of critical importance despite the many changes in football strategy. Gradually, as specialized roles evolved for other positions, the inside left, still with Number 10 on his back, bore the burden of creativity on his shoulders alone.

 Who is a Number 10 in football? Despite the many sobriquets, Williams assures us that he is easily identifiable. These wilful, temperamental dreamers are usually tall, willowy players, gifted with a velvet touch. They are excellent passers and are really the tuning forkwho [set] the tempo and the pitch of play.

 While presenting his selection, Williams has taken care to state that choosing the eleven greatest Number tens in the history of football was both a pleasure and an ordeal. Williamss pain is understandable. There is no Zico, Ariel Ortega, Jay Jay Okocha, Enzo Schifo, Luis Figo, Gheorghe Hagi, Rivaldo, Ronaldinho or even the temperamental but brilliant Paul Gascoigne on the list. (This is a rare example of an Englishman declining an opportunity to push Gazza into a footballing hall of fame. There is little that Williams could have done about George Best though. Best wore the Number 7 shirt.) Williams provides a note of apology to point out the reason for the omissions. Not all Number tens could fit with his definition in the book. Only those who have helped inventing the game have managed to make the grade. The rest, despite their talents, have been dropped.

 So who have made the cut? Williamss list starts, deservingly, with Ferenc Pusks. Recalling the great Hungarian side of the Fifties, Jean-Luc Godard once said that their style of playing was like free jazz. Undoubtedly, Pusks, according to Williams, was the player who shaped the music. Pusks featured prominently in the historic 6-3 and 7-1 drubbings of an English side that boasted players like Stanley Matthews and Alf Ramsey, and in the 7-3 victory of Real Madrid over Eintracht Frankfurt in a classic European Cup final in 1960. There were moments of bitterness too the loss at the hands of West Germany in the 1954 World Cup finals being one. Pel, winner of three World Cups and the scorer of a staggering 1,282 goals in 1,324 matches, follows the Hungarian great. Then there are the two Italians, Gianni Rivera and Sandro Mazzola. Rivera, with his drop-dead looks, played for AC Milan while Mazzola made his debut with Milans rival in the city, Internazionale. Both won their sides numerous scudetti and European Cups. Interestingly, Mazzola outshone Rivera in international matches but it was the latter who was more of a celebrity.

 The only German to feature in the list is the prodigal Gnter Netzer, someone who looked as cool as Best, and then some. Netzer orchestrated West Germanys first-ever demolition of England. He also had a distinguished career in the Bundesliga, in Madrid and in Zrich. However, Netzer was not there when his side lifted the World Cup on home soil. The German coach, Helmut Schn, found him too unpredictable. Also joining Netzer are the Frenchman, Michel Platini, whose moves on the pitch were described as poetry in motion, and Uruguays Enzo Francescoli, who won his country two Copa Amricas. And there is Diego Maradona. Williams goes on to describe, touchingly, the maestros moments of triumph (his early years at Boca Juniors, the magical journey in 86, the club titles with Napoli) and of shame (his drug addiction, many dalliances and the ignominious ban from the 1994 World Cup). Williams seems to hint at a special place in his English heart for the Argentine, the treacherous hand-of-god incident notwithstanding.

 The Nineties are represented by Roberto Baggio, the man with a sacred ponytail, whose footballing tragedies were more memorable than his triumphs; Dennis Bergkamp, who, despite his achievements at Highbury, is the only weak link in Williamss chain; and Zindine Zidane, whose wizardry with the ball is as famous as his head-butt.

 It is not the players that make reading this book a pleasure, but Williamss ability to make us re-live some of the golden moments in football some of which we have seen, and others we have only heard about. A fully stretched Banks parrying out Pels header, a half-crazed Maradona staring into the cameras after scoring his last World Cup goal, or a crestfallen Baggio looking up to the heavens after failing to score in the finals these are some of the games most endearing moments. And Williams takes us through these and many more with a rare understanding and passion that befits a true football-lover. However, one would have liked him to tell us a little more about the kind of people his stars really were, and perhaps what went on in their minds during moments of victory and defeat. In the end, the players remain distant and rather opaque, superstars in all their finery.

 Of course, Williamss selection may not seem perfect to everyone. It neednt be, really. Some footballers are worth arguing over, possibly for ever.

 THE GOING GETS GOOD

 THIS ABOVE ALL 

KHUSHWANT SINGH

 Safe hands

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has belied forecasts of astrologers and political pundits by wielding power for over two years: they had predicted that he would be toppled over within a few months. Day after day doomsayers and soothsayers proclaim that he wont last very long: he seems to be as firmly in the saddle as the day he took the reins in his hands. On Independence Day, let us ponder the way he has governed the country, bearing in mind that he heads a coalition government and is constantly under pressure from his allies, including the president of the Congress party, Sonia Gandhi.

 He has no illusions about having a geographical political base; nevertheless, he commands the respect of all educated Indians for his academic achievements, his experience of running financial institutions and the second most important ministry of the Central government with unquestioned efficiency. Most of all, they respect him for his integrity and humility. He has never been known to have lost his temper, spoken down to anybody nor ever shown favours to relations or friends. Besides his wife Gursharan Kaur, who has to discharge her duties as the wife of the prime minister, no other member of his family has ever been known to throw his or her weight about. He has not appointed a single friend to an important government post. This cannot be said about a single prime minister of the many we have had since independence. Everyone of them promoted sons, daughters, sons-in-law, brothers, brothers-in-law, lady friends, men friends, cronies or someone they wanted to oblige. For that matter, no chief minister, past or present, nor any important political leader can be absolved from the charge of indulging in kumba prasthi and favouritism. That itself makes Manmohan Singh unique and worthy of respect.

 Having examined the credentials of the leader, let us now examine how the country is faring under his leadership. There is still a lot of poverty in the country. In some states, impoverished peasants in debt have taken their own lives; millions of educated Indians cannot find jobs; sectarian violence breaks out periodically; there are more religious fanatics spouting hate; there is more corruption in all walks of life than ever before. However, also see the brighter side of life: there are more cars and buses on the roads; the roads are in better shape than before; there are more trains running faster and giving better service to passengers; there are more people flying to their destinations, more shopping malls and more shoppers with more money to spend on food, drink, clothes, gadgets like cell-phones, watches and trinkets: you get a feeling that they are earning more, spending more. India may not be as shining as the Bharatiya Janata Party netas claimed before they lost the polls, but surely the aam aadmi is better off than ever before. I wish my readers a happy Ganatantra Diwas.

 Beyond borders

 Despite three wars fought between us and Pakistan, despite misunderstandings on incidents like the recent bomb blasts in Mumbai trains, personal relations between people have not soured. On the contrary, they long to renew friendships.

 A recent example is one of Jaidev Hassija who came to see me for my comments on his books Yodon Kee Parchian and Sachaian Jeevan Kee. He told me of his visit to his home town, Jatoi, near Multan.

 Besides meeting many old friends, he also met the grandson of Sardar Nasrullah Khan. Nasrullah Khan had proved himself to be a messiah for the Tehsil Alipur. He had saved the entire Hindu-Sikh population of the tehsil and surrounding villages against Muslim goondas thirsting for the blood of non-Muslims fleeing to India. His gunmen not only patrolled the tehsil, but he also provided shelter to Hindus and Sikhs at night. The inhabitants of the tehsil lauded his efforts by placing a gold mukut on his head. The detailed account of the tehsil has been recorded in the book, Yadein Hee Yadein, by Satya Dev Choudhary.

 The elder son of Sardar Nasrullah Khan, Sardar Nazar Mohammad Khan, came to India in 1992 with many of his friends to meet Jatoiwals in Ganur and Sonepat. People of the Alipore biradari welcomed him with open arms. After this, on January 23, 2006, his son, Sardar Abdul Qayoom Khan, visited Delhi and invited his hosts to visit Jatoi.

 Jaidev Hassija and his business partner, Des Raj Arya, visited their home town in June 2006. Sardar Abdul Qayoom Khan reciprocated and said, Sadian tey akhaan thhak gin tuhadee intzaar wichh(our eyes have tired awaiting your arrival) and recited:

 Aap kya aaye ghar hua roshan

 Haasil-e-Zindagi yeh eik gharee

 Muddaton ek suroor rehta hai

 Yeh inaayat kabhi, kabhi hee sahee

 (You came and our homes were lit

 up

 As if this was the moment they 

 waited for 

 For ages this longing remains

 This blessing may come again 

 and again.)

 Chirping at odd hours

 Early in May, when the mango trees came into flower, I complained that I had not heard koels call. According to legend, they should be at their loudest at the onset of summer. Many people from different parts of the country wrote to me saying they had not heard them either. Just to prove my gloomy forecast of their disappearance wrong, they are making up for lost times. As usual around 4 am, when I opened my windows, it was pitch dark and I heard koels calling. It was early July. Other birds, including the spotted owlets, were still asleep and crows who rear koels offspring had not started cawing but the Koels were in full-throated song. I wanted to ask the one hidden behind mango leaves: The world sleeps, why are you calling at this unearthly hour? Is there another koel up listening to you? They are meant to be silent during the winter months, but I have heard them around midnight in December and January not full-throated but recognizable as koels. Can you explain their strange behaviour?

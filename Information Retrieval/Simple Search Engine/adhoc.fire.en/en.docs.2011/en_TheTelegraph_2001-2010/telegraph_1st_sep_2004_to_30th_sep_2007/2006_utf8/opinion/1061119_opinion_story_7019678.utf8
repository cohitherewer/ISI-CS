 TAKING THE N-TRAIN

 The overwhelming endorsement of the Indo-US nuclear deal by the Senate in Washington is a landmark in the radically altered context of the relationship between the two countries. The relationship, since India became independent, has never been smooth despite the role that the United States of America played in convincing the British that they had to pull out of India. The difficulties in the relationship were partly ideological and partly strategic. India, under Jawaharlal Nehru, chose to flirt with socialism and to nurture a strong and long-term relationship with what was then the Soviet Union. The US, for its own geopolitical compulsions, bolstered up successive military dictatorships in Pakistan. The anti-US rhetoric in India touched new heights under Indira Gandhi; and after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the importance of Pakistan in US strategic thinking increased dramatically. On the Indian side, policies towards the US began to change once the Soviet Union collapsed and India began the process of dismantling the socialist scaffolding to its economy. US attitudes towards India altered dramatically after 9/11 and the US attack on Afghanistan. The new cosiness between New Delhi and Washington has to be seen in this overall context.

 The support that the US Senate has given to the nuclear alliance demonstrates that friendship with India is no longer an individuals or a partys concern. It is a concern of the entire political establishment of the US; and in so far as that establishment reflects the constituencies it represents, it is a concern of the people of the US. Over the last few years, since the destruction of the World Trade Center and the growing menace of Islamic fundamentalism, the political leadership in the US, both Republican and Democrat, have come to recognize the importance of India, and the role that it can play as a partner of the US in the battle against terror and in other spheres. Herein lies the special significance of the endorsement of the Senate which has a Democrat majority. What is equally important is that the so-called killer amend- ments were all defeated. Mr Manmohan Singh and those who worked with him to make possible the Indo-US treaty can now breathe easy about the bill becoming law.

 India has a tremendous amount to gain not only from the deal but also from the general bonhomie towards India that is now on display in Washington. A country aspiring to sit at the high table of world politics always profits from the support of the nation that sits at the top of that table. The new Indo-US relationship, fortunately, is not based on this ideology. Rather, it rests on interests that both sides accept as being mutually beneficial. Those interests need to be nurtured if the friendship is to acquire any kind of permanency. The latter virtue, always elusive in international relations, can only emerge out of common interests.

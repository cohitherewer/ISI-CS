 RIGHT TO DEFEND

 It is unrealistic to expect a failed state to abide by diplomatic norms. The dangers of having such a state as a neighbour are too obvious to be left unattended. But how does a state deal with such a rogue neighbour? This question has bothered New Delhis relations with Dhaka for several years now. If West Bengals chief minister, Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, wants New Delhi to take unusual steps to break the terror network based in Bangladesh, he has strong reasons for recommending such a move. The present regime in Dhaka has a dismal record in this matter. It has persistently refused to accept any responsibility about the Bangladesh-based terrorist and insurgent groups striking at targets in India. Worse, the government of Ms Khaleda Zia even refuses to accept that such groups exist in her country. Her refusal flies in the face of irrefutable evidence not just from New Delhi but from the international community as well. Dhakas postures make it open to the charge that it actually connives with the terror groups and other saboteurs. That such groups have multiplied in recent years is bad enough; but a government that refuses to tackle the menace or even to acknowledge its existence has made things far more difficult for India.

 The chief ministers other worry will also be shared by the people in West Bengal and in several other states. Just as it denies the existence of terror groups or their camps in Bangladesh, Dhaka also dismisses New Delhis complaints about the illegal migration from across the border. This has long had disturbing effects on demographic patterns in the eastern states. With the rise of the terror outfits, the influx is much more than a demographic threat. It should be clear to New Delhi that Dhaka will not willingly help it in cleaning up the mess. Much more than diplomatic bargains may be necessary to secure Indias eastern states from the terror groups across the border. What the Indian security forces did in order to dismantle the shelters and camps of the North-eastern militants in Bhutan is an option available to New Delhi. But Thimphu had helped India in the task, while Dhakas policy and motives are very different. It is time New Delhi made it clear to Dhaka that every country has a right to defend its security and territorial sovereignty. Those who try to play foul or help others to do so have to pay a price for their action.

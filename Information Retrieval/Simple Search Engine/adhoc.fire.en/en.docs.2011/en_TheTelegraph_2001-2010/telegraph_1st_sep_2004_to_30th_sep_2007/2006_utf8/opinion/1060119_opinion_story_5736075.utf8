 AN UNEQUAL GAME

 Raju Mukherji

 What has been the most important change in the game of cricket? It is not the introduction of one-day cricket. Neither is it the advent of sponsorship and the phenomenal revenue earnings. Nor is it the extensive media coverage of the game. The most significant change that has occurred in cricket is in the nature of the pitch.

 The pitch for the first test between India and Pakistan at the Gaddafi stadium in Lahore was disgraceful. It reflects the sad state of thinking in modern cricket which has become totally batsmen-oriented. All the new rules are loaded in favour of batsmen.

 The real worth of a batsman cannot be evaluated by watching him bat on such tracks. Run-making becomes so very simple that a great many mediocre batsmen tend to get wrong notions about their real worth.

 People in power have turned the tables totally on the bowlers. The bowlers have been getting a raw deal for quite a while. Almost all the recent innovations are against the bowlers and favour batsmen: bumpers have been restricted, beamers have been banned, leg-side field restrictions have been imposed to the disadvantage of the bowlers.

 Difficult art

 And the most unfortunate trend is the covering of wickets. Before the Eighties, the pitches were left open to the elements. The International Cricket Council?s rule was very specific: all the pitches were to be left uncovered. This practice was followed all over the world. The last few yards of the bowler?s run-up was kept covered, generally under tarpaulin, to give the bowlers a proper foot-hold. But the actual playing pitch was left to the whims of nature.

 This enabled the pitch to be exposed to overnight dew as well as to rain. Thus batting on such surfaces was extremely difficult. To survive and prosper on exposed pitches, one had to have excellent technique and temperament, loads of courage and application. The bowlers received plenty of assistance from the pitches, especially in the early hours of the day. Later, as the sun shone, the pitch dried up and the batsmen would heave a sigh of relief.

 Bat over ball

 Today many of the cricket pitches have become graveyards for the bowlers and batsmen seem to be receiving all the help from the authorities. This lop-sided development of the game has made cricket batsmen-oriented. Another important aspect is the quality of cricket bats. Since there is no restriction to the weight of cricket bats, these days the cricket bat manufacturers make very heavy bats. Earlier the bats would weigh a little over 2 pounds.Today, they weigh more than 3 pounds. Moreover, today?s bats are so well balanced that even a slight touch can produce a powerful shot. Little wonder than that sixes are being hit over third-man while edges fly off to the boundary.

 However, the weight and size of the cricket ball have remained constant. The ?Kookaburra? balls tend to get their seam dented just after a few knocks.Thus the ball is at a disadvantage in relation to the bat. Further, the use of ?Kookaburra? balls can further discourage bowlers, as the former Pakistan captain, Imran Khan, rightly mentioned. 

 All these factors have given a distinct advantage to batsmen. It is best to accept that a modern-day genius would have been as successful in the pre-Eighties. At the same time, past legends would have been as successful if they were playing today. Actually it is safe to conclude that great cricketers would have altered their technique and their approach to suit the needs of the time. Thus we can safely assume that just as Sir Don Bradman would have relished the present bowling attacks, modern masters would also savour their meeting with the best bowlers from the past.

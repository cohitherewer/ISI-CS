 TRIBE AGAINST TRIBE, VILLAGE AGAINST VILLAGE 

THE BATTLE FOR BASTAR / RAMACHANDRA GUHA

 PART III: The people in between

 Caught in the middle 

The landscape of Bastar is gorgeous. The roads we 

drove on and walked through went up and down, and curved. Hills loomed in the 

distance. The vegetation was very lush: wild mango, jackfruit, sal and 

teak among other indigenous species. The forest was broken up with patches of 

grassland. Even in late May, the terrain was very green. In four days of driving 

and walking, the only non-native trees we saw were in a single scraggly patch 

of Eucalyptus. The bird-life was as rich and as native as the vegetation ? warblers 

and wagtails on the ground, the Brainfever Bird and the Indian Cuckoo calling 

overhead.

In our travels through the region, every now and then 

we passed a stream, mostly sand with a thin line of water somewhere in the middle, 

running north to join the Indravati. Of that great river we were afforded two 

unforgettable sights. The first was of the Chitrakoot Falls, 20 miles from Jagdalpur, 

where the river descends many hundred feet by means of a stone massif, about a 

quarter-of-a-mile wide. In the monsoon this must be quite a picture. The second 

was in Dantewada district itself, where we walked from a village down to the river. 

The water was flowing in three different streams, broken up by sand and rock. 

On the other side lay Abujmarh, its isolation signalled by the densely wooded 

hills beyond.

The scenery was both hauntingly beautiful as well 

as utterly desolate. Evidence of the former lay before our eyes; evidence of the 

latter, in the testimonies of those we met and interviewed. The desolation was 

also implied in the signs planted along the road, which told us that Salwa Judum 

was the main slogan and way (?moolmantra?) by which Naxalism would be eradicated. 

Then it added: ?Naxali Bhagao, Bastar Bachao?.

As a means of saving Bastar from the Naxalites, the 

Salwa Judum and the state administration have uprooted more than 4,000 villagers 

and placed them in camps along the road. While some came voluntarily ? out of 

fear of the Maoists ? many others came out of fear of the administration and the 

goondas commissioned to work with them. Whether refugee or displaced, they 

live in primitive conditions ? in tents made up of plastic sheets strung up on 

top of bamboo poles, open on three sides to the elements. Some pucca houses had 

been built, but these were inappropriate to the climate and context, being small 

and dark, and with asbestos roofs. Worse, the residents of the camps had been 

given no alternative means of livelihood. Once independent farmers, hunters and 

gatherers, they now had to make do with the pickings that came from coolie labour. 

In the camps, the men wore sad, simple lungis and banyans; the women, 

crumpled and torn saris; the children, sometimes nothing at all.

Among those displaced by the Maoists were many residents 

of Belnar, a large village that lay in Abujmarh across the river Indravati. The 

village was divided almost equally among Kallars, a backward caste of cultivators 

and distillers; and Murias, a scheduled tribe who depend more heavily on the produce 

of the forests. The Kallars speak Halbi, the Murias, Gondi. Although the former 

own a little more land and livestock, they depend on the rains for their single 

crop, and would by any commonsensical definition qualify as ?subsistence peasants?. 

However, by applying orthodox Marxist theory in a very orthodox manner, the Maoists 

defined the Kallars as the exploiters, and the Murias as the exploited. They put 

pressure on the Kallars to give away the land, produce, and animals that Marxist 

dogma deemed to be ?excess?. For a time the Kallars put up with the demands, but 

eventually they decided to cross over into the custody of the state.

Moving away from the camps into the villages off the 

road, we found evidence of depredations by the other side. In one Muria hamlet, 

we photographed ten homes burnt by a Salwa Judum mob. This village lay close to 

a hill where the guerrillas were said to sleep by day; the villagers were alleged 

to sometimes give them refuge at night. Among these Murias, the feelings against 

the Salwa Judum ran very high. Against the background of a clump of mahua trees, 

and with a Golden Oriole calling in the background, a Muria woman demonstrated 

the humiliations she was subject to. The men were equally bitter ? wishing to 

live quietly in their homes, they were forced to report at a nearby camp and spend 

the nights there.

The Salwa Judum opposed the Maoists in theory. Yet 

in practice, they complemented their opponents in deepening and making more deadly 

the divisions in society. The fissures now ran very deep. Tribe had been set against 

tribe, village against village. The district magistrate of Dantewada endorsed 

the Salwa Judum position that ?if you are not with us, you are against us?. If 

you did not take sides, you were prone to be labelled a Naxalite, and beaten up 

or put in jail (we saw men who had met both fates). An atmosphere of fear and 

paranoia pervaded the district. Villagers were being encouraged by the state to 

act as spies and informants, reporting on the movement of outsiders and occasionally 

on their fellow tribals too.

On the other side, the Maoists had made a particular 

target of the freshly recruited ?special police officers?. In one especially gruesome 

incident, the guerrillas kidnapped 50 Salwa Judum members. They later set 37 free, 

but killed the 13 identified as SPOs. Maoists also attacked village headmen and 

panchayat representatives, identified by them with the bourgeois political 

system.

There is a massive police presence in the Dantewada 

district. There are three battalions of the Central Reserve Police Force, and 

a battalion each of the Nagas and the Chhattisgarh Armed Force ? this apart from 

regular police. In all, there must be some 7,000 uniformed men in the district. 

Yet there are scant signs of any effective action against the revolutionaries. 

We met three CRPF commanders ? not one had ever seen a Naxalite, let alone killed 

or arrested one.

The armed officials of the state, we found, patrol 

only in the daytime and mostly along the roads. Bunkered in their stations, their 

real interest lies in protecting themselves. Meanwhile, Salwa Judum has been given 

a free hand to behave as they like, with whomsoever they like. A local journalist 

summed up the attitude of the police and the CRPF as follows: ?Apas mein gaonwalon 

ko ladne do, hum apne ko bacha ke rakhenge (Let the villagers fight 

it out among themselves, while we stay safe).?

The majority of villagers, of course, are not interested 

in this fight either. They have been dragged into it, willy-nilly, by the Maoists 

on the one side and the Salwa Judum on the other. As one tribal in Nelasnar told 

us: ?Humme dono taraf se dabav hain, aur hum beech mein pis gaye?. 

It sounds far tamer in English ? pressured from both sides, here we are, squeezed 

in the middle.

In the heartland of India, far away from the din caused 

by the quota debate and the surge of the new economy, a conflict is taking place 

that has already claimed hundreds of families. It is a civil conflict that threatens 

to turn into a civil war. How might it be stopped or contained? The question is 

of crucial importance ? indeed, it might have a greater bearing on the future 

of India than, shall we say, the state of the Sensex. In my concluding article, 

I shall return to this question, and to its likely answers.

This is the third part of a four-part article

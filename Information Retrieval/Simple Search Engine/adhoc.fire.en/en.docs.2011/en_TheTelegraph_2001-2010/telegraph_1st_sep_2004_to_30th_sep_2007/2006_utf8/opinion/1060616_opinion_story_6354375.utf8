 Justice never comes free

Whither justice: Stories of women in Prison (Rupa, Rs 195) by Nandini Oza tells tales of Revli, Budhva, Rehana, Shakuntala and several others, who have spent a significant part of their already-unfortunate lives in the hells that are Indian prisons. The author?s discovery of ?the real culprits? is an account which fills one with rage and shame, more because most of us have had similar experiences, ending with the same feeling of helplessness. This is not a scholarly work, and the portraits often tend towards sentimentality, but there is no reason to doubt Oza?s commitment or sincerity. 

 Political Economy of Globalization (Trafford, price not mentioned) by J.N. Nielsen collects ?one hundred theses on world trade?. For instance, ?Civilization and economic activity are interdependent and perennial?, ?People engage in economic activity while states obstruct economic activity?, and so on. Some, such as, ?People must be distinguished from nation-states? are non-theses, really. The method of explication is similar to that of theorems, stopping short of ending with QED. But why this urge to explore theories about globalization? Because ?the intellectual revolution that began with Adam Smith must come full circle?.

 A Bowstring Winter (Penguin, Rs 295) by Dhruba Hazarika has chapters called ?U Naiwieng?, ?U Nohprah? and ?U Kyllalyngkot?. It is set against the beautiful undulating landscape of Shillong. The plot begins with John Dkhar visiting the Kaizang restaurant, where his life is going to change forever. This is a novel primarily about rootlessness, where the characters move about from restaurant to park to restaurant again, holding conversations which seem to be going nowhere, like the characters themselves.

Free Prize Inside (Penguin, ? 4.50) 

by Seth Godin welcomes readers with this: ?If you?re lucky, your boss bought 

you this book. It?s proof that your company wants you to do great things. On the 

other hand, maybe you should buy a copy of this book for your boss ? and let her 

know that you really want to do great things.? Boss and her? Now 

that?s a lot of political correctness. But lots of truth also comes free with 

it. For instance, ?People don?t buy a watch (just) to tell the time?.

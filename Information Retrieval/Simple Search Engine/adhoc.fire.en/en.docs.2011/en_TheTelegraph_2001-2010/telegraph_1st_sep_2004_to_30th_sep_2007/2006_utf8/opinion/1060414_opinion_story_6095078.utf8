 SUITE EXTRAORDINAIRE

 Gift to posterity

 Suite Fran ccedil;aise

 By Ir egrave;ne N eacute;mirovsky, 

 Chatto amp; Windus, pound; 7.25

 The author of this book and how 

 it came to be published can be the theme of a novel. Ir?ne 

 N?mirovsky was born in Kiev in 1903. Her father was a wealthy 

 Jewish banker. The Russian revolution forced the family 

 to flee to France where she became a best-selling novelist. 

 But her career as a novelist came to an abrupt halt after 

 the Nazi occupation of France in 1940. Ir?ne realized that 

 her survival was under threat given the Nazi attitude towards 

 Jews.

 In 1941, she began writing in secret an epic novel which would depict the times that she was living through. The novel would deal with the daily lives and ordeals of the ordinary citizens of France. She had conceived the novel in four or five parts. She finished only two and these form Suite Fran?aise.

 In July 1942, Ir?ne was arrested and transported to Auschwitz, where she died like millions of other Jews. Her manuscript survived in a suitcase. Her two daughters spent their childhood fleeing from the police but they never abandoned their mother?s suitcase. After the war, finally reconciled that they would never see their mother again, they could not get themselves to read the notebook in which the novel had been written. Many years later, when one of the daughters had become an editor in a publishing firm, she read the notebook to discover the novel. She sent the manuscript to the publisher Denoel, and sixty four years after Ir?ne N?mirovsky?s death, her masterpiece was published. The publication of the novel is an event in itself.

 The novel captures that moment when all seemed lost for France. It opens with a depiction of the exodus from Paris. The narrative proceeds through a series of vignettes ? a banker and his mistress, an aristocratic Catholic family moving with servants, nanny and all, a rich aesthete trying to preserve his china, a famous writer, a humble bank clerk and his wife unable to leave Paris, and so on. The horror of the evacuation is captured through a series of snapshots. War becomes a social leveller. The destination of the movement is rural France, totally unprepared to meet this urban mob whose cars suddenly line the streets, who occupy the local inns and later begin to rob each other. Anonymity engendered a bizarre courage. ?Chance had thrown them together?, the author writes, ?? and now they stayed together though they didn?t even know each other?s names.? This section is called ?Storm in June?.

 In ?Dolce?, the next section, the site of the narrative is a small village through which some of the refugees had passed. A year later, it has a German garrison installed. Some of the characters resurface. N?mirovsky recreates life in the village as if she was there herself. The recreation is detailed and the social comedy present only as an undertow. The novel becomes a document of social history.

 This is one of the great novels of the 20th century now retrieved for posterity.

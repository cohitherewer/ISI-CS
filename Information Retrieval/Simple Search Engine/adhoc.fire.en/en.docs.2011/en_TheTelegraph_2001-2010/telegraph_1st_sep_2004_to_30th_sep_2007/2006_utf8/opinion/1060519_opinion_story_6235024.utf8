The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 Paperback Pickings

 Home away from homeland

Salaam Stanley Matthews (Granta, ?12.99) by Subrata Dasgupta is a wonderful old-world account of a Calcutta boy?s growing-up years in England. Dasgupta may not be a Nirad C. Chaudhuri, but his memoirs are full of simple, innocent moments of delight. The year 1953, historically important as the year of the conquest of Mount Everest, is for the author the year when television came of age in England. And that is how a young boy from Calcutta became besotted with Denis Compton and Keith Miller. This is a book where Christmas carols mingle with the noise of a crackling radio in a Calcutta bylane in the most delightful way possible.

 The Long Reverie of Partha Sarma (Penguin, Rs 250) by C. Sriram is the story of Partha, the ?twenty-four-year-old hapless resident of New Delhi and helpless prisoner of his own bewildering anxieties?. If Sriram is trying to do an Indian Camus, then he is not very successful, in spite of the ?anaesthetizing movies? and the ?infernally humming mind? of the protagonist. This is what 21st-century angst sounds like: ?The idea of suicide was just there one day. He couldn?t say he was surprised; it had always been a standby. But now, for the first time, he saw it, was drawn to it, touched it. He observed it almost as an outsider ? feeling its intense, hypnotic pull, yet chalking it down to boredom more than anything else.?

 The Greatness Guide (Jaico, Rs 175) by Robin Sharma is one of those ?handbooks? which promise their readers success, health, wealth, fame, and all the good things in life. Some of the profundities on offer in this book are: ?The real risk lies in riskless living?, and ?Greed isn?t good. Good is good.? Only the great, perhaps, can be influenced by such words.

Ya-yas in Bloom (HarperCollins, ?4.99) 

by Rebecca Wells follows Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood. 

The members of the sisterhood are the Sex in the City girls of the Fifties. 

The original sorority, comprising Caro, Vivi and Necie, has a new addition to 

their ranks in this one. She is Teensy Whitman. The sisters have been through 

sixty years of their lives ? give or take a few years ? got married, raised children, 

and stuck with one another. Wells moves from their past to their present lives 

very easily.

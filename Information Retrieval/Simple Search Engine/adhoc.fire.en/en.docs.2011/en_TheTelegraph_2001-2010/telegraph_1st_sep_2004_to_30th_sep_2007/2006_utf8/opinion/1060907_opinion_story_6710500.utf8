The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 The lesser muse 

 Aapnara aamader ki deben? (What will you give us?) 

 was the first question the lady asked me. I was looking 

 for nude models in Calcuttas Government College of Art 

 and Craft, and since they were reluctant to speak, I assumed 

 the obvious. But the next question left me fumbling for 

 words: Aapni ki aamader mashik beton paoar byabostha 

 kore deben? (Will you make arrangements so that we get 

 a monthly salary?) 

 I could see that, unlike renowned supermodels, these women belonging to the poorest sections of society were grossly underpaid and often not paid at all. The nature of their work has raised many eyebrows a few curious, but the majority vehemently condemnatory. So they have to function in anonymity, with meagre wages and no job guarantee. Social stigma prevents them from discussing their profession with their family and with acquaintances. In fact, no one in their families is aware of exactly what they do. Secrecy is the only way they can preserve their dignity in a world that almost equates their work with sex work.

 The acute need for money and the lack of other employment opportunities usually compel a woman to take up nude modelling. Each sitting gives her Rs 150, but she does not get the money immediately. A model is paid only twice a year. The governing body prepares the bills and this takes a long time. She has no fixed monthly income. When the college is closed for the vacations, she is out of work. But she has to be present on all working days; if there is a sitting, she is lucky -- else, she goes back home. The college authorities do not treat the women as regular employees; they are daily wage earners. 

 Yet they cannot ask for a raise or a regular salary structure. In any form of organized protest there is a risk of exposure. If people and, most important, their families, find out that they do nude modelling, they will be mercilessly beaten up and stopped from going to the college. Their neighbours will ostracize them. That is one reason they are wary of the media. No matter how sympathetic the media are, publicity for their work will only heighten their chances of losing it. 

 Yet, the models are proud of their profession. One of them challenged me: Didi, aapni parben model hote? (Would you be able to model?) The clerk in the office shouted at her, thinking this would offend me. Indeed, theirs is a very painstaking job. The model has to sit still for four to five hours in front of a group of students. The same model said that when she was new, her whole body used to go numb with pain.

 According to them, the students treat the models with respect and the faculty members are very fond of them. Whenever they are in any trouble, the professors and students never fail to help. Yet, if you ask a teacher or a student whether she would work as a nude model, they would be offended. At the end of the day, the dominant feeling is that though these models are needed for the syllabus, they are actually untouchable. It is easier to condescend to the less fortunate.

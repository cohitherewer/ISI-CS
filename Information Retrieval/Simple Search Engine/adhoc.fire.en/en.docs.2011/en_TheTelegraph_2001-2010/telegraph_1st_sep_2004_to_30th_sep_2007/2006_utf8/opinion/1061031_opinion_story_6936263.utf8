 STAY ORDER

 The monarchy in Nepal has earned a reprieve. But the Maoists decision to allow the monarchy to stay on till next years elections to the constituent assembly shows the countrys dilemma over the issue. The Maoists may even want the constitutional monarchy to be abolished, but there is clearly a lack of consensus on it among Nepals political parties. The two major parties the Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) seem to be undecided on the matter. At the same time, neither of these parties would like to be seen as covert supporters of the palace. Nepals recent history, however, makes a strong case for the abolition of the anachronistic, expensive institution. Much of the political instability in Nepal since 1989 can be attributed to machinations by the palace. Even the latest collapse of the democratic system and the rise of Maoism are the result of the palaces designs to subvert the 1990 constitution. The question is not whether a particular king would be good or bad. Even a constitutional monarchy can pose dangers to the growth of democracy in Nepal because the palace is known to have been used as a platform for anti-democratic forces. The argument that the monarchy is a symbol of national unity is no more than a clich; worse, it is a ploy to keep it alive and, possibly, kicking. 

 However, it is good that the Maoists and the government of Mr Girija Prasad Koirala have not allowed the issue of the fate of the monarchy to stall the peace process. The two sides have a long way to go before the elections to the constituent assembly. A major hurdle is the unresolved issue of the guns in the possession of the Maoists. For the elections to be free and meaningful, it is absolutely necessary that the shadow of the gun is removed from the peoples lives. Whether the elections are eventually held under the supervision of an interim government or not, the two sides must create necessary conditions for a free and peaceful poll. For, these elections will be the first step to the drafting of a new constitution and the general elections to be held thereafter. It has been more than six months since the pro-democracy movement of May forced King Gyanendra to reinstate the elected government. It is important that the new order in Nepal is not delayed for too long. What is even more important is that the government and the rebels learn fast to trust each other.

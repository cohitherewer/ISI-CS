 Smoke alarm

 Too much of a good thing

Sir The nation was outraged by the violence in Mumbai and other parts of Maharashtra that overshadowed the desecration of B.R. Ambedkars statue in Kanpur (Trains set ablaze, lives snuffed out over statue, Dec 1). The way Dalits set trains on fire, damaged property and disrupted traffic is condemnable. There was a total collapse of law and order. Surely, this was not the best means of fighting for Ambedkars honour. The Dalit leaders involved in the mayhem are a far cry from the likes of Ambedkar. The madness in Mumbai will only help Dalits lose the sympathy of the rest of society. 

 Yours faithfully,

B.K. Chatterjee, Faridabad 

 Sir The madness in Maharashtra following the Kanpur incident is shameful. Destruction of public property, inconveniencing people, forcing the closure of shops, blockading roads and so on could have been possible only by the Dalit leaders. Why did the Maharashtra government wait for things to worsen before taking action? One is reminded of a similar madness in Karnataka when the actor Rajkumar died. Indias political circus can be properly managed only if the intelligentsia and the educated classes start running the affairs of the country. They must express their opinion more vociferously. At the same time, laws must be enacted to ensure that those indulging in reckless destruction of public property are dealt with ruthlessly, irrespective of their political affiliation.

 Yours faithfully,

H. Parasuram, Mumbai

 Sir While the desecration of religious idols and statues of public figures should be condemned, it is shocking that public property should be destroyed following one such desecration. The money for restoration will have to come from the taxpayers pockets. It is becoming increasingly fashionable to destroy property be it in Bangalore, Mumbai, Goa or Kanpur. But the effects of such acts are felt in distant places, and by people not even remotely responsible for them. This show of muscle is retarding Indias aspirations towards a more liberal society. 

 Yours faithfully, 

N.G. Gokarn, Mumbai

 Sir India seems to be inhabited by groups of people that exist only to form vote banks. It is quite easy to start a riot in India by damaging a statue. Therefore, the authorities had better remove all statues from public places to prevent vandalism. Indian politicians prefer dumb followers to enlightened voters. It suits them that way since they can try their divisive politics on them and reap the benefits. 

 Yours faithfully,

Raghubir Singh, Pune

 Sir It is obvious that the desecration of B.R. Ambedkars statue was the job of miscreants seeking to cause disturbance, and the Dalits merrily got trapped. All that was needed was for the police to investigate the crime, restore the statue and catch the culprits. But the Dalits damaged trains and buses used by ordinary citizens and vandalized shops. They went to the extent of entering houses and beating up flummoxed residents. Was this an opportunity to vent their anger on the upper castes, or did the Dalits think this was the best means of expressing their gratitude to the government and the sections of society that are trying to improve the lot of the Dalits? In fact, the way they took the law into their hands and resorted to violence shows that the Dalits are now capable of looking after their own interests. Even the most progressive-minded person will now be forced to ponder if the Dalits are being given more than they deserve.

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Sir Lifeless statues have been causing life-size violence of late. Yet statues manage to spring up in every nook and corner of this country. Political parties and their populism are responsible for this unfortunate state of affairs. If the installation of the statue of Shivaji Ganesan in Chennai was challenged in court for obstructing traffic, the statue of B.R. Ambedkar has been responsible for the destruction of public property and human lives. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Narayan, Calcutta 

 Sir Dalit anger has killed 3 persons, injured 100 (including 40 policemen), torched 2 trains, damaged dozens of buses, stranded thousands of passengers, clamped curfew in several places, inconvenienced hundreds of people and caused the loss of crores of rupees. Such incidents should not surprise anyone since the entire governmental machinery is engaged in promoting a caste-based governance. If the government and politicians cannot change this governing philosophy, India is likely to suffer more and more and at an increased frequency too. Caste-based policies should be rejected rightaway, since they earn us a good name but at a very high cost. It is time to concentrate on an agenda to benefit all through rational governance.

 Yours faithfully, 

N. Murthy, Secunderabad

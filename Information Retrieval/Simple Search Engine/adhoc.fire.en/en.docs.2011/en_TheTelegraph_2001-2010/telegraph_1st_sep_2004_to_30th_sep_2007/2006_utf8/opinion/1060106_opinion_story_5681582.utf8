 INTO THE KING?S DEN

 Gir Forest and the saga of the Asiatic Lion, 

 By Sudipta Mitra, 

 Indus, Rs 650 

 Sudipta Mitra?s muse was a crocodile he met in Kamleshwar lake in the early hours of one morning. Along with the crocodile, he saw a chital, a langur, a lion, storks, a Maldhari boy ? ?a conglomeration of the members of Noah?s ark?. And he decided to be the chronicler of the Gir jungles, that run 70 km north-south and 40 km east-west and are home to thousands of species, including nomadic tribes that have lived there for the past 300 years. 

 The book, however, is more a wildlife historical research. The sections ? such as ?The Gir forest?, ?Tribal communities?, and ?Lion: The King? ? do not really follow one from the other, and the bulk of facts and figures comes in the way of what could have been a racy, engrossing read. All the species of birds found in Gir are listed, and so are all the species and subspecies of lions. At times, the book feels like a heavy dossier. 

 At other times, it is riveting, with intriguing anecdotes. For instance, the locals regard lions as souls of dead men on a revenge spree. Mitra tells that lion and man have co-existed for centuries, with the beast rarely, except during droughts, expressing a craving for human flesh. The tigers of Sundarbans are much more dangerous than lions found anywhere, he tells. There are stories of homosexual lions, of a lioness that adopted a young oryx and almost starved protecting it, and of tree-climbing lions in India.

 A lot of space is given to conservation measures as well. Game hunting had reduced the population of lions to less than 300 in the 19th century. When Lord Curzon visited Gir in 1900, he desisted from killing lions to set an example. The nawab misinformed him that there were only a dozen odd lions left, to save the sanctuary. In recent times, there have been a lot of hue and cry about using buffalo calves as bait for counting lions. Forest authorities claimed this was the only sure way, while wildlife lovers like Maneka Gandhi protested. Finally, the authorities relented and now, more modern methods like cameras are in use. 

 The book is informative, well researched, but some first-person accounts, and figures incorporated in the text would have made it a true delight.

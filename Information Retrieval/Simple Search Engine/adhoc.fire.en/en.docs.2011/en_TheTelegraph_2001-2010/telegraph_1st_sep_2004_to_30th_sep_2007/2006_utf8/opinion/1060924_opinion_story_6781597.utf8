 Letters to Editor

 For a better social cause

 Sir Bina Ramani has been booked on cheating and forgery charges. One fails to understand why so much publicity is being given to her, or why some well known social activists are speaking in her support (Taste of Tihar for Ramani, Sept 14). Ramani might be a designer of repute, but is certainly not above the law of the land. There are several women undertrials many of them perhaps innocent languishing in various jails in the country. Why dont the activists help these women who could really do with some support?

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 With force

 Sir The Supreme Courts verdict to reduce political influence in the police system is path-breaking (After 145 years, the friendly policeman, Sept 23). We have become used to seeing officers get plum postings owing to their closeness with the current political dispensation. As a result, officers are constantly trying to curry favour with politicians and acting as puppets in their hands. But this is the story of every aspect of Indian administration. Competent IAS officers, for example, are given humiliating transfers when they do not toe the line of the party in power. The question is, will our politicians get the message from the verdict, or do we have to wait for another judgment to extend the principle across the system?

 Yours faithfully,

C.N. Kumar, Bangalore 

 Sir The apex courts order on police reform will be welcomed by everyone except those in the force who will no longer have it easy. Since the governments at the Centre and in the states have failed to reform the police, it is a good thing that the court stepped in. 

 Yours faithfully,

Pranav Sachdeva, New Delhi

 Sir To remove the possibility of political influence in the proposed national security commission, its head should be chosen by a consensus between the prime minister and the opposition leader just as the central vigilance commissioner is selected. The CBI chief should also be selected in a similar way. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.C. Agrawal, Delhi

 About a date

 Sir Ramachandra Guha is right in saying that satyagraha and civil disobedience movements played an important role in foiling the Britishers dream of extending their rule in India (The three 9/11s, Sept16). Under the influence of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, Indians began to believe in collective power. The shrinking villages, pulled by the twin demands of modernity and tradition, in todays India suggest that we have made a grave mistake by ignoring Gandhis vision. 

 Indians have another reason to remember September 11. It was on this day that Vivekananda delivered his famous speech at the Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893. One wonders why this triumph of Indian religion and culture in the West is ignored by GenNext torch-bearers. 

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind K. Pandey, Allahabad

 Sir Ramachandra Guha expresses his anguish over the United States of Americas record of destroying democracy, citing the example of Chile. Guha, however, ignores the fact that the US helped establish democracy in Japan and West Germany after World War II and conduct fair polls in Afghanistan in the recent past. Has not Russia (or the erstwhile Soviet Union) too subverted democracy in Hungary, Poland and the east European states during the Cold War? But do we mention that, or Chinas destruction of democracy in Tibet? Is this fair?

 Yours faithfully, 

Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

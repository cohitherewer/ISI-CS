 DECLINE AND FALL

 Malvika Singh

 There are more cars than surfaces for vehicles to travel with ease and without endless stress-laden snarls. To add fuel to the fire, drivers have no road manners, speeding like maniacs hitting other cars and men and women en route. Deaths on Delhi streets are endless. In this nightmarish atmosphere, it is impossible to get to any part of this capital city on time. As a result, professionalism is fast becoming an endangered animal with no meeting happening on schedule, with hours spent on the roads amidst mindless jams because of idiotic driving habits with those at the wheel jumping lanes, and parking wrongly. All of this add to the complete anarchy that has become evident here, ranging from roads to places of work.

 Working days, as a result, have become much too short and inadequate. The mandate to sign off on the weekend has also reduced work time. Life has become truly impossible. The graciousness of living has disappeared, quality time spent with family and friends is virtually non existent, a corner quiet is a rare treat, caring for others and finding time for those who are old and infirm is almost a mirage and reading has been put away on some backburner making a whole new generation get its sustenance from television soundbites! This is not a happy situation and definitely not one that nurtures new thinking, fresh alternatives, great aesthetics, fine art, great literature.

 We are in the throes of an economic boom, or so we are told, but the scary part is that there is no cultural renaissance to sustain it. The dumbing down that India is experiencing today, while the middle class is beginning to make good money, has created an environment where negatives dominate, leading to urban breakdown and social upheaval. 

 Uncivil times

 Having been controlled and dictated over for decades, this liberty of choice and availability of goods and services in India has initiated its own set of societal problems and hurdles. If the government had taken note, the social demands and comfort padding that is needed at times such as these, the mindlessness we see around us could have been minimized. Unfortunately, a majority of those who rule us are caught up in the same churning, equally desperate to make good, savour the treats and ignore the difficult realities of social transition, let alone look for satisfying solutions to calm the myriad pains.

 There is a whole lot of people, moving from a semi-rural space to an urban environment, a transition that is ridden with pressures and pulls that they are unfamiliar with and therefore unable to handle with ease. With this comes a sense of social insecurity that in turn leads to strange reactions, a bravado of sorts, much of which is loud, brash and unsavoury. There is not much style and austerity in what we see around us today because those are silent and unobtrusive qualities. I am asserting myself, look at me is the loud call. It is flashy and making its presence felt, having been denied its share of the urban spoils for much too long. A hard working middle class is finally seeing money and product on which they can squander what they earn. The initial excitement has generated an opulence that is un-Indian and a strange mix of bits and pieces culled from the pages of international magazines and popular films and television shows. Those who wear odd designed clothes or live in some of the bizarre habitats that are advertised in our newspapers appear to be rather unreal. Even the names of the urban havens are out of sync Laburnum, Beverly Hills, Malibu Towers. One wonders about the aspirations and dreams of those who revel in such spaces.Where are the great havelis and buildings of our past tradition? Will they be noticed in contemporary India?

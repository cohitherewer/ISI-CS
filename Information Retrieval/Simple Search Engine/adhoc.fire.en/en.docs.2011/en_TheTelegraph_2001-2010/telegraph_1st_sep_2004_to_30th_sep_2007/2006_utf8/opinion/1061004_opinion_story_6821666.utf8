 TARGETTED RADIOTHERAPY

 DOCUMENT

 Excerpts from the International Atomic Energy Agencys Nuclear Technology Review, 2006

 A major development in the application of nuclear medicine therapeutics is the routine use of radiolabelled anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies for lymphoma and radiolabelled peptides...for neuro-endocrine tumours. This finally brings in a new era in targetted therapeutics, which has significantly fewer side effects compared with conventional chemotherapy. 

 A wide variety of radiopharmaceuticals is also available to the nuclear medicine community for providing effective palliation. These are especially useful for metastatic conditions where radiotherapy is not possible...Radiolabelled therapeutic antibodies are leading to significant improvements in patient care and, when combined with chemotherapeutic agents, an increase in the overall survival rates.

 The leading edge in cancer treatment technology now is called dose painting and it is driven by advances in functional imaging. With the advent of magnetic resonance imaging, it became possible to perform spectroscopic studies or acquire functional MRI images that revealed areas of the tumour with different levels of activity...

 It is now possible to locate areas within tumo- urs that may require higher levels of radiation dose...This ability will almost certainly lead to a dose modified and delivered to different function- al parts of the tumour. Dose painting may be altered from one therapy session to the next by using functional imaging studies to periodically monitor the tumour response...

 The use of therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals is increasing and many new radiopharmaceuticals using particle-emitting radionuclides are under development... 

 The major advance in the field of radiotherapy in recent years has been the discovery through several high-quality clinical trials that the addition of pharmaceutical agents to radiotherapy improves the survival of patients with many common cancers such as lung, cervical, breast, head and neck, stomach, rectum, brain and prostate. 

 However, in some cases this comes at the price of greater toxicity. Research continues in an attempt to modify the pharmaceutical agents and their target molecules in ways that will preserve their radio-sensitizing effect on the cancerous tissues, while decreasing the toxicity to the healthy tissues. 

 Research is also being carried out into monitor- ing the delayed toxicity of chemical modifiers on the effects of radiation, as well as identifying target molecules that help cancer cells escape death after irradiation, and targets that are responsible for radiation injury in healthy tissues. 

 The last two decades have witnessed a continuing development in brachytherapy, which consists of placing sealed radioactive sources very close to or in contact with the target tissue. With this modality, high radiation doses can be delivered safely to a localized target volume over a short time. 

 Newer high dose rate sources, remote-control technology, surgical techniques and treatment planning software have contributed to a rapid deve- lopment of this effective treatment modality. In particular, the recent development of HDR cobalt-60 sources may allow modern HDR brachytherapy to be performed with replacement of the sources need- ed less frequently than with other sources.

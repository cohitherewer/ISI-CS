The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 The prime minister at the G-8 summit, Pervez Musharraf on Pakistan television, and the other big shots either in Mumbai, Ahmedabad or New Delhi ? they have all had something to say about the Mumbai blasts, be it through clenched teeth or through tears. It is now time for the second rung to speak up. In true Bollywood style, Milind Deora, MP from south Mumbai, has put together a documentary with terrorism and national unity as its theme. He has brought in Mumbai?s brand ambassadors, Sachin Tendulkar and Shah Rukh Khan, to drive home the point. Meanwhile, down south in Bangalore, the blasts have given industrialist and first time MP, Rajeev Chandrasekar, reason to shoot off his first parliamentary salvo. In a letter to the PM, Chandrasekar has lauded Manmohan Singh for his statement on terror for being the ?firmest indication of resolve I have heard from you since you assumed office as PM.? Clearly, Chandrasekar has learnt the basics of parliamentary lingo which packs compliments with censure. Perhaps Deora should get him to write the script for his movie.

 A new script may soon be unfolding in the MEA. Apparently, it is the Maharashtra governor, SM Krishna, who would be getting the foreign ministry. Krishna, a Fulbright scholar, is supposed to be in the good books of the PM, and close to 10 Janpath, which will have a crucial say in the post-monsoon session cabinet expansion. But there are strong contenders still ? Karan Singh, despite his dismal performance in Nepal; Kapil Sibal, whose claim to the job is based on the temporary duty he performed as minister-in-waiting during the Bush visit; Kamal Nath, who, however, denies being in the race; and above all the indomitable Natwar Singh. Will Krishna manage to trip all of them?

 As the elections approach in Uttar Pradesh, the Samajwadi Party workers get more and more worried. A long time Mulayam Singh loyalist and a known Lohiaite confessed to a journo what the problem was, ?Our party has always been enamoured with the words of JP... First it was Jayaprakash Narayan, now it is Jaya Prada. First she rode the TDP cycle in Andhra Pradesh, now she rides the Samajwadi cycle in UP.? Why worry? JP still rules the roost. 

 While Udyog Bhawan continues to be a hub of intrigue, it is peace time in the sports ministry. Indian Olympic Association chairman, Suresh Kalmadi, and the minister, Mani Shankar Aiyar, appear to have ended their turf war over the Commonwealth Games. When Aiyar was invited to UK to attend the first anniversary celebrations of winning the Olympic bid, he asked Kalmadi to accompany him. Kalmadi was also roped in to address a meet at India International Centre where Aiyar is a key player. Goodwill gymnastics at work. But will it last till the games?

 When it comes to perks and privileges, the higher courts in this land win the case hands down. Delhi high court has a separate pool of bungalows for itself which allows immediate accommodation to be given to judges, even while senior ministers and bureaucrats wait endlessly for their turn. Years ago, when babus rode their heavy duty ambassadors, judges of the Delhi high court had made the transition to Maruti Balenos. Last year, they moved the next notch and settled for Toyota Corollas. Delhi high court, in fact, seems to be moving even faster than Supreme Court judges, who gave up their ambassadors much later and got themselves Chevrolets only this year. Live it up!

 Fighting over stone. Well, the DMK and AIADMK are doing that as well. It was former CM, J Jayalalithaa?s idea to have a life-size statue of MGR in the Parliament House complex. The AIADMK leader had even presented the statue to the legislature. But by the time the relevant committee okayed the proposal, she had lost power in her state. The new Tamil Nadu CM, K Karunanidhi, could not openly oppose the installation, so there were other tactics which were resorted to. DMK MPs have suggested that together with MGR, a statue of the late telecom minister, Murasoli Maran be installed, too. 

 There is every reason why Renuka Chowdhury should be where she is, that is as minister of state for women and child welfare, although she is reported to dislike her present designation. For there is no crusader like her. At a meeting against eve-teasing and women?s exploitation, attended by the home minister, the home secretary, and several other VIPs, Renuka was in her element. While the meeting was on, she noticed that the home secretary, VK Duggal, had three buttons of his shirt open. She got up, pointed at Duggal and asked a simple question. If a woman wore low-necklines or had her buttons open, she would be accused of luring men. What happened if a man came bare-chested? Should the home secretary had come to the meeting that way? Renuka?s question was met with pin-drop silence. While the rest sat shell-shocked, Renuka continued her barrage on how the problem of rape, eve-teasing, molestation could be solved.

 Whatever his reasons, the chief minister has done his image no good by getting involved in the CAB elections, writes Ashis Chakrabarti

 Battle royale

 Two questions are being asked about next Sunday?s elections to the Cricket Association of Bengal. One, who will win ? Jagmohan Dalmiya or Prasun Mukherjee? As in the run-up to any polls, the answer varies, depending on which camp in Maidan politics one speaks to. Two, why did Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee get involved in the CAB polls? The disapproval implied in the second question has become more pronounced after Dalmiya defied the chief minister and filed his nomination for the CAB president?s post. 

 Complicating the matter for Bhattacharjee, two ministers of his government ? the maverick Subhas Chakraborty and Kshiti Goswami ? have spoken out in Dalmiya?s favour. Chakraborty has been a loose cannon for many years now, routinely embarrassing his party, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), as well as the chief minister. Ironically, he was the one Bhattacharjee had chosen to persuade Dalmiya not to contest the polls. It is possible that Chakraborty betrayed the chief minister?s trust and actually did the opposite of what he had been assigned to do. 

 Since both Dalmiya and Chakraborty are known to have been close to the former chief minister, Jyoti Basu, the CAB story has spun into one of conflicts within the CPI(M). After all, Dalmiya got the land for his leather complex at Bantala, allegedly on very easy terms, during Basu?s tenure. Adding to the atmosphere of intrigue and suspense is the fact that Dalmiya?s challenger, who enjoys Bhattacharjee?s support, happens to be the commissioner of Calcutta police. 

 All this would have been irrelevant to the CAB elections if Bhattacharjee had not thrown his hat into the ring by wishing Dalmiya not to contest the polls. If Dalmiya?s refusal to oblige him has embarrassed the chief minister, he has only himself to blame. 

 Obviously, Bhattacharjee had his reasons for doing what he has done. It is no secret that he has no love lost for Dalmiya. It is also known that Bhattacharjee has been upset over many things about Dalmiya?s leather complex. The problem is that the chief minister did not ? or could not ? spell out his reasons for opposing Dalmiya?s re-election as the CAB president. 

 In the absence of the chief minister explaining his stand, others attributed two reasons to it. One, Dalmiya?s departure from the CAB would clear the way for Sourav Ganguly?s return to the Indian team. Bhattacharjee has made no secret of his anguish over Ganguly?s exclusion from the team. And, Dalmiya, once Ganguly?s mentor, is now seen by some as the man behind Ganguly?s fall. So, Bhattacharjee wants Dalmiya out in order to see Ganguly in again. Or, so the argument goes. 

 The other argument offered for the chief minister?s move goes like this. The CAB has become a den of corruption and nepotism under Dalmiya. But there is a new power equation in the Indian cricket administration. The Board of Control for Cricket in India, headed by the Union agriculture minister, Sharad Pawar, will blacklist Calcutta and the CAB if Dalmiya continues to rule the roost at the CAB. So, removing Dalmiya is necessary in the interest of Bengal?s cricket and a clean CAB.

 We now hear from none other than Ganguly himself that something is indeed rotten in the CAB. And, in an email from England, where he continues with his poor form in the county championship, he compliments the chief minister?s efforts to clean up the Augean stable at the Eden Gardens. But, why didn?t Ganguly complain all these years, one might ask. Was it because he then had good equations with Dalmiya? Is he now trying to sail with the wind and hoping to please the reigning group in the BCCI by turning back on his erstwhile protector?

 If things are really wrong at the CAB, Dalmiya will be the man at fault ? he has made it his personal fiefdom. But does it follow that the chief minister or the government should intervene in a sporting body?s affairs? If a government does so, it has to publicly tell the people its reasons for doing so. It should be left to the members of such an organization to clean up their house. 

 The argument about Bhattacharjee intervening on Ganguly?s behalf is even more preposterous. No matter what his Bengali fans say, Ganguly?s ouster was clearly due to his bad form. The tiff with Greg Chappell may have hastened it a bit. But what is truly revolting is the idea that Ganguly is using Bhattacharjee to plot a return to the Indian team. If such a thing were to happen, it would be a blot on Bhattacharjee?s image. It would be a very sad day for Indian cricket when chief ministers can push their candidates into the national cricket team.

 Now to the other grey area of the chief minister?s campaign ? his support for the police commissioner as Dalmiya?s challenger. Mukherjee may have all the credentials to be the CAB president. It is not as if serving police officers have not run sporting or other organizations. If Priya Ranjan Das Munshi can lord it over the All India Football Federation for so long or Sharad Pawar can run the BCCI, there is no reason why a police officer or a bureaucrat cannot do so. 

 The problem with Mukherjee?s candidature is the chief minister?s support. It is difficult to believe that the government?s arms, especially the police, will not be used to influence the vote in Mukherjee?s favour. Even if the police commissioner wins an honest vote, he ? and Bhattacharjee ? may not escape the charge of misuse of official machinery. 

 And, what if, after all this, Dalmiya still wins? He has snubbed the chief minister by deciding to contest the polls. His victory will rub salt on Bhattacharjee?s wounds. 

 Suppose the two sides strike a compromise and Dalmiya withdraws from the contest at the eleventh hour. Even that scenario cannot bring cheer to the chief minister. In the public perception, it will remain a very dubious victory for him. It cannot do his image any good if the people feel that only those with his blessings can win elections in Bengal, even the ones in a sporting organization.

 Everything considered, it cannot have been a good move by Bhattacharjee. Many in his own party feel just the same. Subhas Chakraborty may have his own reasons for siding with Dalmiya. But those in the CPI(M) who do not approve of Bhattacharjee getting involved in the whole thing have a different reason. Many of them dislike Dalmiya for much the same reasons as the chief minister. But they think it was an unnecessary battle for the chief minister to join. If he really had enough justification for being involved in it, he would have done better to fight it from behind the scenes. 

 But one thing is for sure. Ganguly is the biggest loser in the whole episode. He has to be exceptionally gullible to hope that he will be back in the Indian squad. To make matters worse, now he will be seen as a man of bad faith too. He has had his hour in the sun, been a good batsman, though not in the same class as Sachin Tendulkar or Rahul Dravid, and led the Indian team to some great wins. One expects such a cricketer to know when his time is up and to bow out gracefully.

 WRONG HEADED

 Subsidies carry with it the baggage of welfare. But the notion of welfare carries with it the more important question, ?Welfare for whom?? The obvious and the unobjectionable answer is welfare for the poor. Very few would disagree with the proposition that in a country like India, with immense economic inequalities, people below the poverty line need the support of the state to survive and to get access to the facilities that make for a civilized existence. Among these would be food, housing, health and education. This is somewhat self-evident. Yet, the energies and funds of the ministry for human resource development are not channelled towards providing education to those below the poverty line. The recent controversy over reservation and quotas show that the HRD ministry?s targets are the IITs and the IIMs, the centres of excellence in higher education. Creating reservations in these institutes would mean that students entitled to reservation would have to be subsidized through state funding. Those funds could be put to much better use if they were utilized in the field of primary education. Millions of poor children have no access to elementary education because there are too few schools, or where schools exist, they are beyond the means of the poor. There is no concentrated effort on the part of the HRD ministry to extend and increase government support to primary education, especially in the rural areas. Yet, this is the realm in need of welfare measures. The IITs, the IIMs and other centres of excellence in higher education which provide opportunities mostly to students from the affluent sections can be left to fend for themselves without government support. The money thus saved can be better spent in subsidizing school education in the rural world.

 This anomaly is not difficult to explain in the context of Indian politics. Indian politicians and political parties are driven by what is best described as visible populism. The word, ?visible?, is critical. Creating quotas in the IITs and IIMs is more visible and provides greater mileage than subsidizing schools for the poor. Quotas in these institutes help to create and perpetuate the delusion that politicians are working for the poor, when in reality they are doing nothing of the sort. The allure of this delusion is evident from the fact that it not only tempts Mr Arjun Singh and his ilk but also the left, which is committed to thinking differently.

 Abodes of the divine 

 MOSQUES (Roli, Rs 695) by Razia Grover celebrates the architectural splendour of mosques from all over the world. It chronicles how contemporary influences in design and style have merged with the traditional in these places of worship. But Grover rsquo;s concern with history becomes excessive for a work which ostensibly deals with the architecture of mosques. Since Islamic architecture is distinguished by its ornamental details, one expects more attention to them than Grover cares to devote. And while some of the pictures capture the grandeur of their subjects, most of them are disappointingly flat. On the top left is the multiple-aisled prayer hall of Tinmal in North Africa;after that, Haj pilgrims touching the holy Black Stone; the exquisite carvings on the Qutb Minar; and bottom, perforated screen partitions and elaborate tile work of a mosque in Spain.

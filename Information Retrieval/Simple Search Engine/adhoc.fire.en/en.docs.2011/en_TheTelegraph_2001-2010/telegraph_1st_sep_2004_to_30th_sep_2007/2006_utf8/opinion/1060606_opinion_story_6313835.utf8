 THE INVENTION OF COMMUNAL ILL WILL 

Memories of conflict become long-term sectarian hatred 

only in very special circumstances, writes Tapan Raychaudhuri 

 Refugees coming to India from Pakistan,1947 

Professor Muhammad Habib, in his brilliant essay on 

Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, concluded his statement as follows: ?We owe him the bitterest 

drop in our cup, the poison of communalism.? A recent essay on the destruction 

of the Somnath temple suggests that there may be an element of the misreading 

of evidence in the statement. The essay fails to find in contemporary sources 

a great upsurge of Hindu revanchism generated by the happenings at Somnath. The 

event, it seems, did not instantly produce broods of Togadias asking for Ghazni?s 

blood. The destruction of temples and sacking of cities surely do not endear conquerors 

to the victims. But was temple destruction more hurtful than murder and rapine, 

which accompanied all military conflicts? 

The great champions of Hindu glory according to one 

school of thought, the Marathas and the Rajputs, spent more time fighting one 

another than in defending the Holy Motherland against the vile Yavanas. Did that 

create any permanent sense of grievance in one clan of Rajputs or one branch of 

Marathas against their counterparts whom their ancestors had fought? If Togadia 

had read any history he would know that his beloved Gujarat had suffered more 

at the hands of the Marathas than through the lightning incursions of Ghazni. 

He has not suggested, so far, that all Marathas including Bal Thackeray should 

be hanged, a measure he has warmly recommended for the country?s Muslims ? the 

Ghaznis, as he calls them.

I have raised these rhetorical issues to make two 

related points. Wars and invasions, which have long been integral to human experience, 

do not create permanent wounds in the psyche of a people. Oriyas do not hate the 

memory of Asoka, nor the Sri Lankans the memory of Prince Vijaya. The very painful 

experience of early Norman rule is not cited in English school textbooks as a 

reason why British children should grow up to hate Frenchmen. The English and 

the Germans, who have fought two bitter wars within a period of three decades 

are now close allies, as are the Japanese and the Americans, Hiroshima and Nagasaki 

notwithstanding. Memories of conflict become sources of long-term hatred only 

in very special circumstances and if, in the light of later developments, such 

hatred can be generated and sustained for some specific political ends.

There is, indeed, a long record of temple destruction 

in India under rulers of Turkish or Turko-Afghan origin. This fact has been over-played 

in a certain type of historical writing and soft-pedalled in another. Very recently, 

an American historian, R.M. Eaton, has tried to analyse the nature and motivation 

of such acts in 80 cases. He shows that they were mainly centred round the shrines 

to presiding deities of the ruling dynasty and were meant to deprive the latter 

of legitimacy derived from divine protection. It is not certain that the acts 

provoked great popular resentment any more than the horrors accompanying conquest 

usually do. As evidence, I have pointed out elsewhere that 150 years after Aurangzeb?s 

death, Hindus and Muslims fought together to restore the iconoclast?s descendant 

to the imperial throne.

A second and more important question: how was the 

conqueror, the iconoclast, or the oppressor perceived? Did the Hindu subjects 

of Turkish or Afghan kings see them first and foremost as Muslims? The historical 

evidence suggests that the rulers certainly did not lay primary emphasis on this 

single dimension of their identity. The chroniclers emphasized the family or clan 

the rulers come from and the dynasts, of course, as happily fought other Muslims 

as they did the Hindu chieftains. And there is no evidence to suggest that the 

Hindu subjects, especially their vast majority the peasantry, saw their Muslim 

counterparts as rulers, especially oppressive rulers. If temple destruction and 

other forms of oppression did generate resentment, there is nothing to suggest 

that it was generally directed against the Muslim component of the civil population, 

visiting the sins of the dynasts on their co-religionists among the subjects.

Yet traces of mutual resentment are certainly there 

in the medieval record. I shall cite a few stray examples. The fundamentalist 

mullah was uncompromising in his emphasis on the need to suppress idolatry. 

When Alauddin Khalji stated his inability to concede Qazi Mughisuddin?s demand 

that all Hindus be converted or killed, the Qazi advised that Jaziyah be collected 

with appropriate humiliation; the kafir should be asked to open his mouth 

as he paid the tax and the Muslim collector should spit into it. Such extreme 

prescriptions were not implemented, but the attitude which informed these must 

have had their ramifications both among Muslims and Hindus. In short, there was 

a persistent tradition of fundamentalism which resented the toleration of idolatry. 

It is difficult to imagine that intolerance did not breed resentment. The chronicles 

often refer to the wars of conquest as jihad when directed against Hindu 

chieftains. In Bengal, the Muslim punthi literature is full of imaginary 

episodes of battles between Hindus and Muslims, though interestingly they inevitably 

end in tales of reconciliation. In Bengali Vaishnav literature, Chaitanya?s biographies 

all refer to tyrannical acts by Muslim rulers. The term used to describe them 

is Yavan and such tyranny is cited as one reason for the advent of Chaitanya as 

an incarnation. 

A couple of centuries earlier, Vidyapati, in a well-known 

passage, described the oppression by Turkish soldiers, adding that the Sultan 

would have punished the miscreants if he had come to know of their misdeeds. This 

allusion provides a clue to our understanding of communal disharmony. The oppressor 

here is no remote tyrant, but a humble soldier not very distant in terms of social 

level from his victims. And one can see how the hatred of such petty tyrants, 

often settled as iqtadars among the local population, could turn into the 

hatred of a community. The notion of ?Muslim tyranny? probably derived from such 

experiences. Doctrinally, the medieval smritis bracketed Muslims with the 

Chandalas and other untouchables. This may simply express the Brahminical obsession 

with purity that prohibited all contact with people whose ways were ?unclean?. 

Muslims certainly learned to live with this quaint barbarism, but it is not possible 

that the classification and the practice did not generate resentment. More than 

one medieval Bengali text refers to the oppression of Brahmins and Vaishnavs, 

their being forced to carry baskets of beef and the ritual markings on their foreheads 

being wiped out with spittle. No one has suggested that these were daily occurrences, 

but a single such incident can have widespread ramifications. 

The realities of economic and social life begot a 

pattern of co-existence and co-operation, and both folk and high cultures were 

deeply enriched by the encounter between the two traditions. But occasional outbursts 

of tyranny at the grassroots level, probably created the hard core of communal 

hatred. The Dutch factor, Pelsaert, mentions that it was not safe for a Hindu 

to venture out during a Muharram procession. In a different context, we find the 

Vaishnav saint, Shyamananda, telling off the Malla Raja of Vishnupur for employing 

Muslim guards. They were duly dismissed. Bharatchandra, a highly Persianized scholar-poet, 

records the perceived differences between Hindus and Muslims in doctrine and practice, 

and describes with distaste Alivardi?s iconoclasm. In his writing, all such conflict 

ends in reconciliation and that almost certainly was the dominant reality. But 

the leitmotif of mutual ill will keeps surfacing over and over again. 

In pre-British days, these were exclusively urban, 

localized and of very short duration. They were rooted in social friction ? familiar 

issues of cow slaughter, music before mosque or the red powder of Holi applied 

to unwilling beards. These riots were marked by a degree of ferocity. These were 

little flames of hatred which, with the aid of a favourable wind, could develop 

into a forest fire.

Under British rule, such ill winds emerged as a dominant 

fact of life. The ill will underwent a change in character and assumed unprecedented 

dimensions. One factor contributing to this negative development was a radical 

shift in the country?s political culture. Social identities, especially the sense 

of community, had neither any political connotation nor any pan-Indian referent, 

in pre-British days. Two very different influences altered the character of social 

and cultural identities. Western education and the new print-culture made people 

aware of the possibility and attraction of nationalism and sub-nationalisms. People 

became aware, for the first time in their history, that there was honour and pride 

in being a sovereign nation. That other levels of identity ? religion-based community, 

linguistic groups, caste, sect and so on ? could also be matters of pride and 

bases for solidarity and, as such, for joint action to enhance one?s status and/or 

securing one?s rights became a part of the new social consciousness. Hence we 

have a plethora of organizations celebrating the glories of being Indian, Hindu, 

Muslim or Bengali, Vaishnav, Kayastha and so on.

Of these multiple levels of identity and identity-assertion, 

the two that proved most potent were the national and the communal. We have emerging 

associations of all Indians, and we have great movements for the cultural self-assertion 

of Hindus and Muslims respectively. The Hindu lamentation over fall from Aryan 

grace, unfortunately, marked the beginning of myths of alleged Hindu slavery from 

the days of the Turkish conquest. That conquest was always referred to as the 

?Muslim conquest?, and the long centuries when Turkish or Afghan kings ruled the 

greater part of India as ?Muslim rule?. 

The phrase, ?Muslim rule?, is a misnomer. Unlike the 

British at a later date, the Muslims as a people or community never ruled India. 

But the notion projected by British historians became a part of India?s cultural 

baggage. Hindu patriots lamented the centuries of alleged Muslim tyranny. Muslim 

intellectuals shed tears over their community?s loss of power and glory, tracing 

back the fall from grace beyond India?s frontiers and comparing the current moral 

degeneration with the utopia under the orthodox Caliphs. These two mutually exclusive 

myths nurtured the seeds of conflict which were always there.

Exclusive identity for Muslims became an object of 

aspiration at two levels. Movements for cultural revival, like the one initiated 

by Shah Waliullah, traced the source of Muslim fall from power to the incursion 

of un-Islamic ways. This implied a direct assault on the elements of syncretism 

in Indo-Islamic culture: bida or departure from strict observance of the 

sharia, had to be given up. At another level, especially in Eastern India, 

ideologically similar movements, the Wahhabis and Faraizis, rooted in agrarian 

grievances, emphasized the need for a Muslim way of life unpolluted by Hindu influences. 

Since this emphasis was fed by exploitation in the hands of the Hindu zamindars 

and moneylenders, the movements acquired a sharp edge of aggression. Some fierce 

communal riots were among their products.

British policy did take advantage of such growing 

tensions justifying the thesis that ?divide and rule? was a fact of life. But 

the real contribution of the raj to the mutual alienation of Hindus and 

Muslims derived from a different dimension of imperial strategies. In the constitutional 

structure they adopted for India and their executive actions in distributing shares 

of power and resources, they recognized Hindus and Muslims as separate constituencies. 

Perforce the two began to compete for larger shares qua communities. Separate 

electorates clinched the division opening the road to Pakistan. 

This political competition mobilized the elements 

of mutual ill will: the nationalist message of the need for unity transcending 

the barriers of community lost out. From the mid-Twenties, the underprivileged, 

especially in urban areas, were mobilized to fight on the streets in support of 

what were essentially elite causes. Current post-modernist analysis questions 

such theses and emphasizes the autonomous agency of the underprivileged. But the 

vicious communal riots, mid-1920 onwards, can be shown to be anything but spontaneous 

outbursts. Much of the horrendous killing during the partition riots were carefully 

orchestrated. Such studies as we do have of this violence do not unfold any pattern 

of spontaneity.

 A CONSENSUS ON DEVELOPMENT

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the report of the UN secretary-general, August, 2006

 At the 2002 International Conference on Financing for Development, held in Monterrey, Mexico, world leaders committed themselves to a new global partnership to achieve the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals. The Monterrey Consensus reasserted each countrys primary responsibility for its own economic and social development through sound governance and policies to fully mobilize domestic resources.

 These national efforts were to be supplemented by the commitment from developed countries to provide improved access to international markets ... stable and predictable official development assistance and private capital flows and a better international architecture to prevent and manage financial crises ....Increased national responsibility was also to be accompanied by a greater voice and greater representation for developing countries in international economic decision-making. 

 ...In implementing this vision of global partnership, many developing and developed countries are leading by inspirational example. But many of them, despite their best efforts, simply remain too poor to make the investments needed to escape the trap of extreme poverty. It is these countries that require the most urgent international support if we are to fulfil the promises of the Millennium Declaration. 

 Recent global political debates have rightly shifted the emphasis from principles to practicalities ....In January, 2005, the Millennium Project presented to me its report ... stressing the need for practical measures ....In March of the same year, I submitted to the General Assembly my report entitled In Larger Freedom: towards Development, Security and Human Rights for All, which set out a strategic vision for collective action to achieve universal freedom from want, as well as freedom from fear and the realization of dignity for all. Both reports stressed that breakthrough action was required at all levels if implementation were to proceed at a scale commensurate with countries development needs ...

 ...2005 saw a number of important commitments to a global development agenda ....All member states emphasized the vital role played by the major United Nations conferences and summits in shaping a broad development vision and in identifying commonly agreed objectives, and strongly reaffirmed the Millennium Development Goals as the shared, time-bound, integrated and measurable framework for development cooperation. 

 For the UN system, it has been extremely enco- uraging to see the goals gain political momentum ....Citizens around the world are rightfully calling upon their governments to be ever bolder in following through on the goals. As a result, international development efforts have regained ambition, fusing the possibility for success with a heightened sense of urgency.

 At the 2005 World Summit member states agreed to a practical framework for decade-long action ... In particular ...comprehensive national strategies to achieve the internationally agreed development goals and objectives ....Member States also committed to launching quick-impact initiatives, immediate steps that can save and improve millions of lives within the span of only a few years. These include actions to distribute anti-malaria bed nets...to eliminate user fees in basic education and health...

 World leaders further agreed to several other important targets at the 2005 World Summit. I am therefore recommending the incorporation of these commitments into the set of targets used to follow up on the Millennium Declaration. 

 This includes a new target under Millennium Development Goal 1 to make the goals of full and productive employment and decent work for all, including for women and young people, a central objective of our relevant national and international policies and our national development strategies; a new target under Goal 5 to achieve universal access to reproductive health by 2015; a new target under Goal 6 to come as close as possible to universal access to treatment for HIV/AIDS by 2010 for all those who need it; and a new target under Goal 7 to significantly reduce the rate of loss of biodiversity by 2010.

 QUOTA KING

 Some believe that Arjun Singh has 

his eyes on the highest political throne

 It was May 21, 1991 ? a hot and moonless night. Arjun Singh arrived at 10 Janpath, well past midnight, looking extremely grim and sombre. The news of the brutal assassination of a smiling young man in Tamil Nadu had spread like wild fire, benumbing the nation. 

 Suddenly, a group of party workers joined him. In a low voice they began chanting, Sonia lao, desh bachao. Heads turned even as Arjun Singh maintained a stoic silence. Even in grief, the political instincts of Congressmen were as sharp as ever. And Arjun Singhs agenda had been set into motion. 

 Cut to circa 2006. The grim faced man has not changed a bit. When the rest of the political class was engaged in Assembly elections in five states, Singh dropped the quota bomb, forcing the hands of his alleged bete noire, the Prime Minister, and the party. Higher reservations for backward classes in educational institutes, he argues, is for the emerging Congress leadership (read: Rahul Gandhi) to help prepare the ground for a Congress return in a region where the party stands decimated. The Thakur from Madhya Pradesh believes that heir apparent Rahul needs a repackaged socio-economic agenda to translate public rallies into votes. 

 Singh may know what hes talking about, for he cut his political teeth as an understudy of D.P. Mishra, often described as the Chanakya of MP politics. A man of few words, he continues to have a loyal band spread across the country. He is known to shower favours on his favourites and expects unflinching loyalty in return. A strong votary of power politics, Singh is a firm believer that power can overcome many handicaps. His quota plank, ostensibly to help out Rahul Gandhi in Uttar Pradesh, is a reflection of this line of thinking. 

 Some say Singh looks ahead. In 1991, when Rajiv Gandhi was killed and the clamour rose for Sonias participation in politics, Singh was acutely aware that she was not even a char aana ? or a primary ? member of the Congress party. He gave little thought to Sonias leadership qualities or her obvious unfamiliarity with the complexities of the political system. But the old Congressman thought he had the future all clearly etched out. According to an insider, when Singh subsequently proposed Sonias name in the Congress Working Committee that was held to elect Rajiv Gandhis successor, Sharad Pawar ? another politician among politicians ? looked anxiously at him. At that juncture, someone passed a note to Pawar. Scribbled on it were the words: She will not. Pawar looked relieved. 

 But like Pawar, some believe that Singh, too, has his eyes on the highest political throne. For Singh, 10 Janpath ? the home of the Gandhis ? is the way to nirvana, or South Block, the Prime Ministers Office. 

 In Madhya Pradesh, Singhs contemporaries like Motilal Vora and associates, including Digvijay Singh and Ajit Jogi, believe the 76-year-old politician has taken the theory of raj yoga too seriously. Propounded by a number of soothsayers, astrologers and babas, Arjun Singh is somewhat convinced that he has raj yoga ? or a spell of political rule ? in his kundli. His spiritual guru, Ujjain-based Mauni (or the silent) Baba, is said to have immense control over Singh. As communication minister under Rajiv Gandhi, Singh had granted two telephone connections to the Mauni Baba, prompting an Indore-based Hindi daily to run a screaming headline, Jab baba bolta nahin to do telephone kyon (why give two telephones to baba when he does not speak?). 

 But in the last 15 years, Singhs fortunes have been on the decline. In his home state, he and his son Ajay are considered no-hopers. But the old man is determined to fulfil Mauni Babas prophecy? trying to reach the pinnacle via 10, Janpath. During the P.V. Narasimha Rao regime, Singh fought a titanic battle with Rao, yet another Chanakya, sacrificing his promising political career to become a die-hard Sonia loyalist in the hope that one day Madam would recognise his devotion and worth. As a reward, he was hoping that she would make him the most powerful man in the country. 

 But May 22, 2004 came and went. Forced to take his steps with the help of a walking stick, Arjun Singh saw a much junior but straight-backed Manmohan Singh taking an oath of office and secrecy under the watchful eyes of Sonia Gandhi. He was back as a minister of human resource development, an office that he had demitted amid much fanfare on December 24, 1994. Even in the breakaway Congress group that he joined, seasoned Narain Dutt Tiwari upstaged him. In MP, Congress (T), named after Tiwari, was addressed as Congress tinka (straw). 

 The years in the wilderness have taken their toll on him. At the personal front, too, things are not as good as they used to be. Family insiders say that his relations with his two sons are at an all-time low ? the patriarch did not even get to attend the wedding of his grandson. In recent days, his constant attempts to draft daughter Beena Singh into politics have come to naught. 

 Singhs current dreams may have collapsed but the dreamer stays on course. In 2007, a vacancy in Rashtrapati Bhawan would offer an opening to him to prove his Babas raj yoga theory ? Sonia willing, of course.

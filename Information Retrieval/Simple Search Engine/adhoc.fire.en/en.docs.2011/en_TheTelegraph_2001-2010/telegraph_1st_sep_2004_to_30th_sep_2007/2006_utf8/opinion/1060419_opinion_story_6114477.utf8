 RESTORING THE BALANCE

 DOCUMENT

 Extracts from the United Nations World Water Development Report 2, 2006

 Industry at all scales needs reliable water resources to prosper and encourage investment in industrial growth. Available water resources and freedom from water-related disease also encourage inward foreign investment.

 ...The present global population is around 6.4 billion and growing at some 70 million per year, mostly in low-income countries....Urbanization can be a force for good, in terms of economic growth and global integration. However, some of the factors that helped to create wealth in industrialized countries, such as youthful populations, a middle class, nearness to political power and ethnic/religious diversity, can be potential sources of conflict...but people...have no jobs and even the educated...struggle to find meaningful work. As things stand now, 85 per cent of the world?s young people are in low-income countries and the average unemployment rate is four times the overall adult rate. The potential consequences of this situation are...social and political unrest.

 The problem is often worst in rural areas where young men cannot inherit land because plot sizes... have become so small that they are no longer viable. Thus, the men lack a secure livelihood and reduced prospects of marriage....While the youth bulge will decline as fertility rates continue to fall, some countries (in sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East) are still experiencing rapid growth in young adult populations. It is likely that these countries will pose a challenge to the development of their region and to international security 

 ...Back in 1970, about two-thirds of the total world population lived in rural areas. By 2001, this had dropped to just over 50 per cent. On current predictions, by 2020 this will have fallen to 44 per cent with 56 per cent of the population living in urban areas. Until recently, Africa was considered the least urbanized continent. This has changed.

 By 2020, Africa?s urban population is estimated to reach 500 million ? up from 138 million in 1990. Malawi is the current fastest urbanizing nation due to population flight from severe flooding. Nigeria has also seen tremendous urban growth while huge slums are found in Johannesburg and Nairobi.

 Rebuilding economies, damaged lives, shattered infrastructure including water and power systems... restoring damaged irrigation systems, removing landmines in post-conflict situations, absorb 27 per cent of all Overseas Development Assistance. The Convention on the Prohibition of Military or any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques seeks to prohibit acts such as weather modification and harmful flood creation. The threat posed by the release of toxic chemicals into the environment has further prompted calls for a new convention. It is no coincidence that many of the countries yet to make progress on debt relief are those recently emerged from conflict situations.... 

 At present, the world is going through an unprecedented process of integrating finance, trade, communication and technology. By eliminating tariffs and other barriers to trade, the world?s economy is becoming increasingly interlinked....Transaction costs and investment risks can be reduced and greater investment encouraged....Reduced costs in telecommunications and energy infrastructure are possible. For water, globalization enables economies of scale through access to bigger markets, facilitates improved cooperation over international waters, and allows a benefits-based approach towards regional water-resource systems and intercountry collaboration on water knowledge and skills...in developing countries....Countries with urban growth exceeding 4 per cent per year are twice as likely as others to experience civil disturbances.... 

 We are living in a period of rapid...geopolitical change. Previously established empires and countries have broken up while neighbouring groups of countries seek closer economic collaboration....The former centrally controlled economy of the Soviet Union is now a collection of nation states trying to enter the global economy, without the experience or institutions to cope effectively.... New nation states, wary of sharing the water resources of transboundary rivers and aquifers, become very defensive about their perceived sovereignty...especially as resources are pressured by increased demand and deteriorating water quality.

 Death in the kitchen

 Sir ? Deaths due to exploding LPG cylinders are being regularly reported in newspapers. One wonders whether necessary investigations and follow-up actions are being undertaken by the authorities concerned on this issue. There is need for active involvement on the part of the government since the number of deaths caused by LPG cylinder explosions has been increasing at an alarming rate. The cylinders are supposedly manufactured by licenced agencies and tested for required strength. They are also meant to be periodically tested under pressure to ensure that with age and corrosion the cylinders do not become too weak to withstand the fluid pressure. Finally, there must be safety checks while laying down the strength limit of the cylinder. It is doubtful whether the LPG companies are strictly adhering to the book in this regard and if agencies and inspectorates empowered to enforce safety regulations are vigilant enough.

 Yours faithfully,

K.B. Goswami, Calcutta

 Unequal faith

 Sir ? It seems that a group of over-zealous priests is trying to take over the controls of certain important Hindu shrines in Kerala (?Scent of Jasmine pollutes temple?, July 2). In this context, it must be mentioned that Hindu scriptures do not confer the rights to touch idols on men only; nor do they bar women from such an act. Fanatical and self-serving priests have formulated their own laws of worship to gain undue power and prestige. The rituals of purification at the Rajarajeswara temple premises are an insult to women and should be condemned in the harshest terms. There are exceptions to such discriminatory practices though. In Tamil Nadu for instance, the Velangani shrine is open to members of all communities. At the famous Tarakeswar temple in West Bengal, men, women and children of all ages touch and even hug the idol while worshipping the deity. It is a pity that even as technology has brought the world closer to our doorstep, such archaic customs still prevail in many of India?s temples.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The brazen display of obscurantism and gender bias by priests in the Sabarimala temple did not come as a shock to many Indians. Instead, they took great pleasure in denouncing the Kannada actress?s act of devotion as sacrilegious. The controversy surrounding a two decades-old episode brings to mind what Jesus Christ said two thousand years ago ? that religion was made for man but man was not made for religion. If man is to progress in life, he must rid religion of its orthodoxy or switch over to a new faith to keep up with the times.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? It is ironic that the followers of a religion that worships female deities such as Durga and shakti as manifestations of the divine should consistently discriminate against women when it comes to places of worship. It is not god but the self-appointed guardians of the alter who would look upon a woman?s offerings at the Sabarimala as a violation of the temple?s sanctity. It is time people cut across class and caste lines and threw the godmen out to re-establish a faith that advocates a simple, personal style of worship. All the talk about growth and development would come to nothing if sections of Indian society continue to languish in the middle ages. After all, it is not possible to achieve social progress unless there is spiritual development in individuals. The solution to social evils such as gender discrimination or communal hatred does not lie in a temple or a church but in a change of heart in the devotees. 

 Yours faithfully,

R.S. Chatterjee, Siliguri

 Sir ? There has been a spate of reports in the media referring to the desecration of the Sabarimala shrine. However, most of the reports were short on facts and long on opinion. It is a violation of one of the basic rules of reporting if a report is not based on facts, but on the view s of the reporter. Personal opinions should never be permitted to colour facts. In Jaymala?s case, she touched the feet of the idol of Lord Ayyappa 19 years ago, and thereby broke the rule that forbids women from entering the shrine. This rule is based on the belief that a menstruating woman?s presence defiles the sanctity of the shrine. We wish to point out that standard journalistic practice was not followed while covering this particular incident. There were no attempts made to get the opinions of those in a position to comment. Instead, in some cases, the reports use loaded words such as ?shameful? and ?a blot? to describe the incident, without ascribing them to anyone, as though they are universally accepted beliefs. To describe the incident as a ?desecration? is itself a value judgment being passed by newspapers. The place for such judgments is the edit page, not the news pages. Would anyone carry a news report which described a Dalit?s entry into a temple as ?desecration?, without ascribing these views to someone ? Why then are newspapers passing off an equally unscientific, retrograde, and misogynist superstition as fact?

 Yours faithfully,

Kala Rao and ten others, Mumbai

 Truant minister

 Sir ? One fails to understand the purpose of Lalu Prasad?s visit to Europe (?Lalu goes on Euro rail odyssey?, July 5). What the Indian Railways needs immediately is the repair and upgradation of railroad tracks; maintenance of rolling stock, enhancement and improvement of passenger security and the provision of basic amenities, which are the need of the hour. The minister?s summer trip to the cooler climes cannot take care of these age-old problems of the Indian Railways. Soon after taking over as the railway minister, Lalu Prasad had introduced the unhygienic khullar to replace plastic cups in trains, and nearly succeeded in replacing the fire-resistant bedsheets with khadi alternatives and towels with the gamchha. In the perspective of these retrograde steps, one suspects that the only purpose of his present trip is to interact personally with the ever-so-eager suppliers of railway equipment.

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta

 Sir ? While Lalu Prasad savours the wonder of Europe, Indian passengers have to make do without toilets on local trains even when the journey takes more than three hours.

Yours faithfully, 

S. Mukherjee, Burdwan

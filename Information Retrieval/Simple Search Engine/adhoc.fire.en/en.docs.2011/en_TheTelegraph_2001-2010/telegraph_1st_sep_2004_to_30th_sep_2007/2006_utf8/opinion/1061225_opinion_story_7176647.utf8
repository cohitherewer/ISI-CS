The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 FILTHY RICH

 For Indian politicians, getting rich is inglorious. The leaders are supposed to not only live modestly but also be seen doing so. They must keep up the pretence of plain living, no matter how much money they make. The railway minister, Mr Lalu Prasad, can justifiably feel relieved that the Patna high court has given a clean chit to him and his wife, Ms Rabri Devi, in the disproportionate assets case. The United Progressive Alliance government, which had faced a major embarrassment in the conviction of the former coal minister, Mr Shibu Soren, in a murder case, has been spared a similar dilemma with Mr Prasad. The trouble is that political parties treat such cases only as weapons against their opponents. Empty words on political morality are traded for some time before the noise dies down and the politicians are back to business as usual. It is far more important to ask fundamental questions about the commonly accepted benchmarks of political morality. It is time to ask, for instance, why being rich should be seen as a disadvantage in Indian politics. There is absolutely no reason why a politicians worth should be measured by how much or how little money he or she has. 

 It cannot be anyones case, however, that a politician should get rich by abusing the system. The Patna courts verdict gives Mr Prasad only a reprieve; he faces six fodder scam cases. Irrespective of the verdicts in these cases and their political consequences, both the government and the political class need to look deeper into the causes of political corruption. The Bharatiya Janata Partys cries against the tainted ministers in the UPA government do not reflect the larger concerns. Whether Mr Prasads acquittal gives him an edge over the BJP in Bihars politics is only a minor issue. The real question is how to cleanse politics of the systemic corruption. The answer to this cannot be found in partisan politics or in the politicians keenness to settle scores with rivals. Only a broad consensus among the parties can tackle the larger problem. The other important issue relates to the need for insulating public institutions from political pressures. An official agency such as the Central Bureau of Investigation must not be seen to be working at the behest of the government of the day. Political corruption can be checked to a large extent if the institutions can save themselves from the politicians.

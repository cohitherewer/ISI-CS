 UNDER A CLOUD

 The political chaos in Bangladesh is no mere law-and-order problem. Mr Iajuddin Ahmed, the countrys president and now head of its interim government, has clearly misjudged the nature of the current turmoil. His decision to deploy the army in order to maintain law and order is, therefore, unlikely to help matters. The unrest in Bangladesh may have created problems of law and order, but it actually reflects the peoples anxiety over the fate of their nascent democracy. It is not enough for a democracy to have elections at regular intervals. The electoral exercise can be a farce if conditions are not created for a free vote. The Awami-League-led 14-party alliance, which has been agitating for a revised electoral roll, wants to ensure that the vote is fair. The alliances complaint about large-scale inaccuracies in the current rolls has been confirmed by the finding of a Washington-based human rights group. In fact, the finding, which puts the number of bogus voters in the current rolls at over 10 million, shows the enormity of the problem. Elections on the basis of these rolls can only be fraudulent.

 Worse still, the election commissions responses to the complaint, instead of clearing the air, have put it under a cloud. Its decision to defer the elections by only two days, supposedly for revising the rolls, suggests that it is not taking its task seriously enough. The commissions indifference will only strengthen the suspicion that it is conniving with political and other elements that were responsible for preparing the rigged rolls. This is so especially because the election officials were chosen by the previous regime of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Mr Ahmed could have used his powers as the head of the caretaker government to cleanse the election commission and the electoral process. Instead, he has chosen to ignore the larger issues and to take a narrow, administrative view of the crisis. Given the Bangladesh armys history of destabilizing, rather than helping, democracy, it is a potentially dangerous step.

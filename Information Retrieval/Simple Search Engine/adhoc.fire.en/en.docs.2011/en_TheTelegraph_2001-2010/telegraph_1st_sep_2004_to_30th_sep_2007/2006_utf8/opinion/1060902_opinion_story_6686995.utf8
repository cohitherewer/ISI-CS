The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 NOT ALLOWED IN THE HOUSE

 Parliaments all over the world have their own protocol. The most important of these are the ones that regulate the use of language. Unparliamentary language has become synonymous with abuse. Criticism or even a display of anger on the floor of the House has to be tempered. Thus the speaker in parliament has to be a master in the use of euphemism. When Winston Churchill wanted to accuse an opponent of lying, he said, memorably, that the honourable member had been economical with the truth. Churchill got his point across without in any way breaching parliamentary protocol. In so doing, he also enriched the English language. Unparliamentary Expressions published by the Lok Sabha still lists liar as one of the banned words. This despite the fact that it is widely acknowledged that members of the Lok Sabha, at the best of times, are not always very generous with the truth.

 The restrictions on language imposed by parliaments can also take away from wit and humour. The volume in question informs its readers that in South Rhodesia a parliamentarian was admonished for having described a road as having more curves than Marilyn Monroe. It is difficult to comprehend why this happened since Monroe was definitely not present in that august body; also, she was never ashamed of her own curves. This can only be taken as a sign of changed mores within parliament. In the late 18th century, an aristocrat told the radical John Wilkes that the latter would die on the scaffold old or of the pox. Wilkes retorted that it would depend on whether he embraced his opponents principles or his mistress. That retort was not expurgated, and has, in fact, acquired an iconic status in the annals of parliamentary humour. Political correctness has obviously led to a stricter regime and greater self-censorship.

 Unparliamentary Expressions holds many surprises. According to it, persons have got into trouble because they called three members of parliament three musketeers in the course of a speech that was delivered in the House. To ordinary mortals, accustomed to literary allusions, the epithet sounds innocuous. But within parliament, such a comment can only raise the admonitory index finger of the speaker of the House. The latter, it needs to be remembered by all MPs, is more than primus inter pares within the House. There is very little that can be said about him in criticism which does not transgress parliamentary protocol.

 Indian parliamentarians, or at least a large number of them, may follow the protocols of language but the same cannot be said about their behaviour. They rush to the well at the drop of a hat. Things have been hurled at rivals. There are enough reasons to publish a companion volume listing the number of things that cannot be done on the floor of the House.

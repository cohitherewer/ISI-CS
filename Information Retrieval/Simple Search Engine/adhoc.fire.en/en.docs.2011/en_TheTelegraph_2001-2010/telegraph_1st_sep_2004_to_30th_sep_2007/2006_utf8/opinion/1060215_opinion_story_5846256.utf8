 TWIST OF IRONY

 If the left is increasingly willing to wound the government of Mr Manmohan Singh and yet afraid to strike at it, the reasons may be very different from what they appear to be. Economic issues such as the privatization of airports and the introduction of foreign direct investment in retail have caused fresh tensions between the United Progressive Alliance government and the left. The Iran vote may have symbolized the dissonance on foreign policy issues. But the real problem for the left seems to be its growing fear of being marginalized by a government that survives on its support. This is an ironic twist to the beginning of the UPA-left relationship. The left supported the UPA government not only to keep the Bharatiya Janata Party out of power, but also with the hope that it could control the UPA government?s policies. Its failure to prevent the privatization of two airports and the entry of FDI in retail has upset it on two counts. The left is afraid of losing its power over the government, and sees a new resolve in the government to ignore its pressures and press ahead with the reforms programme. It is this sense of loss that makes the left scream and kick more and more.

 A note of belligerence can cover this sense of insecurity; but more importantly, it can be a good strategy in an electoral season. The left and the Congress have to fight each other in West Bengal, Kerala and Assam. Both parties have their own electoral constituencies to please and inspire with competitive political rhetoric. It may thus be in the interest of both camps to make a show of their differences. Obviously, the electoral compulsions require some political posturing. But there are real political stakes as well. It is natural for the Congress to try and increase its strength in the states. Ms Sonia Gandhi spelt out that goal to the Congress leaders during the party?s recent session in Hyderabad. This too came as a warning to the left, which saw in the Congress?s ambition a new threat. The only way the left can hope to retain its new-found influence in New Delhi is by keeping its forts in Bengal and Kerala intact. Poll strategies are based on rivalries, and not on cooperation.

 However, part of the left rhetoric is unlikely to make any difference either to the Congress or to the UPA government. For all the noise that it makes, the left has little option but to carry on supporting the government. That is why it had to drop its plan to stay away from the UPA-left coordination committee. It is a trick the left had tried earlier without success. The other ploy ? of reviving a third front of non-Congress and non-BJP parties ? is also bound to fail. And the left leaders know this best. The left has to find other ways to come to terms with the changing political reality.

 The final bow

 Sir American tennis icon, Andre Agassi, bid farewell to the game after losing to Benjamin Becker in this years US Open. There is no doubt that age and injury hastened his decision to retire from international tennis. But, like a true champion, Agassi gave a memorable performance even in his last match, stretching his opponent to four sets. Agassis absence will create a void which will be difficult to fill. Undoubtedly, there have been better tennis players than Agassi, but none more colourful than him. Agassis epic duels against his long-time opponent, Pete Sampras, will be remembered for a long time. 

 Agassis game was based on certain admirable traits a bullet-like service and the best return in the game after Jimmy Connors. His double-handed cross-court shots were a treat to watch. Hopefully, Agassi and his wife, Steffi Graf, will utilize their talents to groom a younger generation of world champions in tennis.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir It is really sad to note that the man who entertained the world of tennis for well over two decades has finally decided to hang up his boots. Andre Agassi is truly a remarkable man, both on and off the court. Everything about this great player from his flamboyant hairstyles to flashy T-shirts and denim pants has been loved by his legion of fans in the course of his career. Indeed, few other players have managed to earn so much love and respect. And it is not as if the American has always been on the top of his game. In the early part of his career, Agassi was taken in by the glamour that is an integral part of tennis. Consequently, there was a decline in his game and his successes were few and far between. But the man had the courage to accept the criticism and bounce back into the limelight. He came back strongly to win the Australian and the French Open, to add to his tally of grand slam wins. His loss in this years US open may have brought his career to an end but people will always remember Agassi as a fighter and a lovely human being. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir Andre Agassi has had a long and illustrious career. He has won all the four grand slams as well as an Olympic gold medal. Unlike other players who resorted to power tennis, Agassis baseline game and shot-making abilities led to great rallies which were worth watching. He is one of the few players who have learned to show respect to a game which takes a lot away from players, while rewarding them in other ways.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir The photograph which showed Andre Agassi breaking down after his defeat in the US open was rather moving. But he need not have fretted about losing to a qualifier in a prestigious tournament. After all, very few tennis players have managed to achieve what the American has managed to accomplish on court. Had Agassi been fully fit, he would have definitely won his game against the German opponent. Agassi is already a legend and he will be remembered for decades to come. One single loss to an unfancied opponent is unlikely to leave a mark on his career.

 Yours faithfully,

 Poison in the air

 Sir The editorial, Peoples poison (Aug 31), is right in voicing concerns about the increasing air pollution in Calcutta and its adverse impact on the health of citizens. Unfortunately, the administrators seldom pay attention to such dire warnings, as they are busy with other important tasks. Worse, we have a coalition at the Centre which is besieged by conflicting interests. This forces the authorities to dither on issues of public welfare. As a result ,we have old vehicles spewing venom plying our streets. The footpaths have been taken over by hawkers selling their ware. Plastic carry bags continue to be used despite being banned items. Roads are dug up before the monsoon, thereby adding to the woes of commuters. One wonders whether the government is at all willing to spare a thought for the concerns of the populace. Decentralization of power has resulted in even para clubs harassing defenceless, unorganized people. There is little use in protesting against the wilful neglect of the citizen. Ordinary people are meant to lead a life of deprivation and the leaders know this as well. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir It would make a lot of sense for autorickshaws to switch over to liquid petroleum gas. But there is no doubt that the unions will be up in arms over such a move, despite the fact that such a conversion will benefit both the nations economy and public health. This only goes to show that the government has no control over the unions. Even the offer of incentives to encourage such a switchover is unlikely to do the trick. 

 Some metros like New Delhi introduced LPG on the instructions of the courts. Perhaps, in the case of Calcutta too, an order from the courts will help in turning things around for the better. 

 Yours faithfully,

 The world on your head

 Weight (Penguin, Rs 225) by Jeanette Winterson is an interesting book from ?The Myths? series that brings together some of the world?s most popular myths which are retold in a contemporary setting. Here Winterson, who won the Whitbread prize for her debut novel, brings the Greek heroes Atlas and Hercules to the 21st century. At the same time, she sets about exploring how this tale, along with many others, influence our lives, desires, fears and destiny. The book is written with rare wit and verve. Sample this t?te-?-t?te that Hercules has with Atlas as they dine under a starlit sky ? ?You?re holding up the Kosmos and I?m spending twelve years clobbering snakes and thieving fruit. The only good time was chasing Hippolyte...she didn?t want to do anything with me when I caught her. Independent women are like that. I don?t know which is worse ? the dependent ones who bleat at you all day, or the bitches who couldn?t care less.? Its a delightful way of rediscovering myths that are read and loved all over the world.

 Murphy?s Revenge Headline, 

 ? 2.99) by Colin Bateman is a racy whodunnit 

 whose plot is bound to impress those who scripted the television 

 series, NYPD Blues. Detective Martin Murphy is on 

 the trail of a malevolent killer who, quite strangely, is 

 in the habit of bumping off those who are accused of murder. 

 Murphy, who suspects a support group to be behind the heinous 

 crimes, goes about his hunt with gusto, only to realize 

 that the cat-and-mouse game would throw up a past that he 

 is desperate to shun. The book, with interludes full of 

 sex, booze and violence, is sure to make the reader cry 

 out for those good old Sherlock Holmes mysteries.

 Confessions of an economic hitman (Ebury, ? 7.99) by John Perkins makes an attempt to unravel the deception, greed and intrigue that characterize clandestine deals penned by the American government and US corporates. Perkins has lived many lives ? an ?economic hitman? who tricked poor countries into accepting loans that would saddle them with insurmountable debt, a CEO, an expert on shamanism and that of a teacher/writer. Perkins?s style of writing is as colourful as his career. These are two hundred and fifty pages of trash which are bound to impress those who smell a conspiracy at the drop of a hat.

 Indiscretion (Headline, ? 4.25) by Jude Morgan is the story of Caroline, whose impoverished father cajoles her to befriend the rich and childless Mrs Catling. This opens the doors to a new and elegant world for Caroline, a beautiful and intelligent woman who becomes the centre of attention in the closely-knit society. But desire also fuels cunning and Caroline soon finds herself entangled in a devious design. Richly written with vivid descriptions of Regency England, there is a definite touch of Austen in this book.

 Dance of the Fireflies (Frog, 

 Rs 250) by Rucha Humnabadkar is another ?heartrending? 

 story of the bittersweet experiences of a small town boy 

 in the city. Its now the turn of Chotu to leave a remote 

 village for the city, where he suffers numerous hardships, 

 including sexual abuse. The little boy endures them all 

 and emerges hurt but wisened. There is also Tasneem, an 

 orphan and Chotu?s friend. Together, they discover the joys 

 and despair of life in a city. The novel celebrates the 

 triumph of the human spirit over adversity but one gets 

 the feeling that we have read all this before.

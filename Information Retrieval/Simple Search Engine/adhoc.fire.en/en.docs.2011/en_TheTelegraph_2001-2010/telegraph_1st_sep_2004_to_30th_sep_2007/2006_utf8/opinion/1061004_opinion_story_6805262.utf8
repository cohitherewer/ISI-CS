The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 COMING UP

 India has improved its rank in the World Economic Forums annual review of global competitiveness. This year, the WEF has used a more comprehensive global competitiveness index compared to last years growth competitiveness index, but it has also helpfully given last years ranks in terms of the GCI. India has moved up marginally, from number 45 to number 43. That has led to much self-congratulation, particularly because Indias rank is well above those for the other BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) countries. In emerging Asia, Taiwan, Malaysia and Thailand are still ahead, but India seems to have beaten the rest of them. A look at the disaggregated indices shows that India has a high score in innovation factors ranking 26 compared to Chinas 57. India is number 41 on the efficiency enhancers index, which means it is doing particularly well in market efficiency. But it lags behind the others in the basic requirements index, doing badly in infrastructure, the macroeconomy and in health and primary education, where it is a dismal 93. 

 In other words, while India seems to have got its markets, institutions and technology right, it has not done so well in the social factors and in building physical infrastructure. Meanwhile, the governments deficit continues to be a reason for concern. That conclusion is borne out by the fact that India does very well in the companion business confidence index, where it is ranked 27th. This index measures the national business climate and the efficiency of companies. Of course, it can also be argued that the confidence of foreign investors in the Indian markets reflects their confidence about the earning potential of Indian companies. In a sense, foreign investors are voting for the India story with their money and the competitiveness rankings mirror this confidence. The report has also been criticized for its methodology, especially for its reliance on an executive opinion survey in which 11,000 business leaders were polled in 125 countries. That is 88 people from each country, hardly big enough to be a representative sample.

 Nevertheless, such complacency misses the validity of the studys findings. For example, the ranks clearly show that the sectors which are the most closely associated with the government are the ones in need of urgent reform. It also shows that one consequence of Indias market efficiency, as compared to its inadequate infrastructure, is that inflows into the country take the form of volatile portfolio inflows rather than foreign direct investment. More importantly, the study underscores the fact that the low-hanging fruit in terms of reform have already been picked and further improvement will call for vision and political will on the part of the government. Unfortunately, there are few signs of that.

 Loss of pride

 Sir ? India?s defeat in the one-day series against the West Indies proves that the single-minded effort of Rahul Dravid, Greg Chappell and Kiran More to keep Sourav Ganguly out of the eleven is harming Indian cricket (?A lesson Greg won?t forget?, May 28). It was absurd on the part of the selectors to ignore Ganguly ? particularly for the test series ? when Sachin Tendulkar was not available. Everybody is aware of the need to groom youngsters for the future. However, players like Suresh Raina, Ramesh Powar and Robin Uthappa, among others, are still not good enough to step into the shoes of a veteran like Ganguly. What exactly are the selectors and the coach-captain duo scared of ? Ganguly performing too poorly or too well? To make matters worse, Chappell?s arrogant remark at the beginning of the series not only provoked the West Indians to play out of their skin, but also made Chappell and his boys look like fools.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? It is time for the Board of Control for Cricket in India to salvage India?s cricketing pride from the obduracy of Kiran More. More should realize that a successful team needs talented players, not egotistic selectors. Indian fans were deluded by the euphoria from the recent home victories of the Indian team. The Caribbean debacle has exposed More and company?s mishandlings of the game. As his records show, Sourav Ganguly is a world-class player in the one-day format and would have been the ideal opener with Virender Sehwag in the absence of Sachin Tendulkar. However, with Rahul Dravid as an opener, the entire middle order has become fragile. Besides, the only bowler who was in form, Ajit Agarkar, has been replaced with the novice, V.R.V. Singh. In More?s book, experience does not count, while youthful exuberance gets blind encouragement. More and Chappell are using their emphasis on the future of Indian cricket as a means of deflecting blame even as the performance of the Indian cricket team gets poorer. The BCCI must now make More worry about his own future.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The distressing performance of the Indian team in the West Indies so far shows the necessity of giving players a rest once in a while. Cricket itineraries, these days, are detrimental to the players? health and performance. It is easy for some former cricketers to say that playing for the country is motivation enough. But these admonitors themselves have retired and do not have to physically exert themselves any more. Since cricket seems to be driven only by economic motives, the respective boards would do well to consider a simple law of economics, which posits that the more a commodity is consumed, the less the utility derived from an additional unit of it. Put more simply, if the International Cricket Council and the boards decide to stick to the present international calendar, a day will soon come when the game will be played to empty stands. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The Indian defeat is a timely warning to Greg Chappell and company. Nobody expected the Indian team to lose the one-day series in the manner they did, given their successful run in the limited version of the game recently. The most striking aspect of the loss to the West Indies was the Indian batsmen?s inability to play spinners although they were, till the other day, the best players of spin. Their nemesis during the current tour, Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels, are not even regular spinners. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? West Indies being the venue of the cricket world cup in 2007, India?s collapse there is all the more disappointing and worrisome. Nor will this performance boost the confidence of the young players. While various technical and practical factors are often cited as the reason for India?s failure, the psychological dimension is often overlooked. The Indian team became complacent after winning the first match and forgot that, with two exceptions, the other Indian batsmen had failed in that match. Rahul Dravid himself did not score well in the next three matches, and we know the outcome. While the team management need not answer queries about Sachin Tendulkar?s replacement, Sourav Ganguly? s exclusion and the persistence of non-performers on the team, they must, nevertheless, ensure the mental fitness of the players.

 Yours faithfully,

K.B. Goswami, Calcutta

 Sir ? The BCCI is not likely to heed the danger signals and will go ahead with its stubborn experimentation in the test matches too. The team will definitely be strengthened if Anil Kumble and V.V.S. Laxman join, but Ajit Agarkar?s exclusion on the pretext that he is only good for the shorter version of the game is ridiculous. One can only conclude that Kiran More, Greg Chappell, et al, are not interested in improving the team. Still, we should set aside the debate for a while and see how India performs in the test series. Rahul Dravid?s captaincy and Chappell?s coaching need to be reviewed, but the post mortem is usually performed after the patient dies.

 Yours faithfully,

Bidyut Kumar Chatterjee, Faridabad

 Sir ? Rash comments such as Greg Chappell?s fire the opposition and make the team psychologist?s task tougher.

 Yours faithfully,

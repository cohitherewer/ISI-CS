 Paperback Pickings

 Of laughter and forgetting

 The Legends of Pensam 

 (Penguin, Rs 200) by Namang Dai 

 shows that some of the best literary works in India 

 ? even in English ? come from its most neglected pockets. 

 Namang Dai is prudent enough to introduce Arunachal Pradesh 

 and its people at the very beginning. But the fact that 

 he has to do so at all is unfortunate. Just as sad is the 

 image of old villagers walking miles every day ? mainstream 

 India has no time to spare for the development of Arunachal 

 Pradesh ? and still saying: ?When you look at the land you 

 forget your aches and pains.? Dai?s prose is beautiful, 

 flowing as easily as the waters of the Siang. Here?s a sample: 

 ?Every day I saw clouds dropping lower and lower like ominous 

 waves. The hills were blue, their outline rimmed in black, 

 and the trees were still. Soon, the first fat beads of water 

 would tear the giant leaves of the wild yam. Then fierce, 

 hissing rain would cover the land like the sea.?

 First proof (Penguin, 

 Rs 275) is the second volume of new writing from India, 

 containing selections under fiction, non-fiction and poetry. 

 Altaf Tyrewala?s ?An Indian porn director?s speech to his 

 hesitant leading lady? rues the ?colonization not of our 

 geography or society but of our carnal imaginations?. Rahul 

 Karmakar?s tiny vignette recounts the horrific movement 

 against Bengalis in Assam in the late Seventies. The non-fiction 

 section is particularly rich, with the travelogues by Jeet 

 Thayil and Manju Kak, a personal account by Sheela Reddy, 

 and the story of the making of a docu-feature by Smriti 

 Nevatia. Most of the writers ? Reddy, Karmakar, Samrat Choudhury, 

 Sanjay Suri, Ranjana Sengupta, Dhruba Hazarika, Soumitro 

 Das, Annie Zaidi among others ? are, or have been, print 

 journalists. Is the newspaper or magazine the new stepping 

 stone, then, for Indians with literary aspirations?

 The undercover Economist 

 (Little Brown, ? 5.99) by Tim Harford 

 begins by asking as simple a question as ?Who pays for your 

 coffee?? and goes on to show how David Ricardo can be brought 

 in to explain the making of a cup of espresso. Who would 

 have thought that the whole phenomenon of globalization 

 could be explained by analysing the price charts of Costa 

 and Starbucks? Harford moves from coffee to Google to Durex 

 condoms in an explication of how the global economy functions. 

 Surprisingly, the book is both interesting to read and easy 

 to understand.

 The Tenth Circle (Hodder 

 and Stoughton, ? 6.90) by Jodi Picoult 

 is the story of fourteen-year-old Trixie Stone, rather about 

 her overprotective father, Daniel, who was ?raised as the 

 only white boy in an Eskimo village?. Did Daniel drug and 

 rape his own daughter? The novel has the answer to this 

 and also to the question, ?How far would you go to protect 

 your daughter??

 India Smiles (Penguin, Rs 195) brings the winning entries from the Sulekha.com humour contest. The winners come from the most diverse of professional spheres, only having the funny bone in common among themselves. Nirupama Subramanian wakes up to the universal truth that the words, ?Free beer? can bring tears of joy to the eyes of a grown man just as the words, ?Sale! Sale!? can bring to a woman?s. Viji Raghunathan gives a comic account of the Indian expat parents? hankering for an Indian daughter-in-law. Manjul Bajaj writes about his father, who keeps losing his shirt (?Hold on Dad. Salman Khan is pass?. Keep that shirt on.?) and thinks he is an economist. But most of the entries are not funny enough ? more like clever accounts of life sent on email to friends.

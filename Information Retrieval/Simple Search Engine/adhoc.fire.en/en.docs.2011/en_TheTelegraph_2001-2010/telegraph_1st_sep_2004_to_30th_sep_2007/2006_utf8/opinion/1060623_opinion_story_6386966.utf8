A Nomad Called Thief: Reflections on Adivasi silence (Orient Longman, Rs 295) by G.N. Devy talks about a particular kind of silence that colours the way we look at and think of tribes in India. The essays in this book discuss certain critical aspects of tribal life in India ? the threat to the physical environment of tribals and their knowledge system, the richness of tribal literature and culture and the organized violence faced by adivasis, in some states of the country. However, Devy does not delve into the aspects of oppression or marginalization alone. He also highlights initiatives that have been undertaken for the uplift of the quality of tribal life ? from literary magazines to health and microfinance schemes. Written in an engaging manner, Devy?s book enriches the subalternist tradition that gives the reader a perspective from below. 

 Dance like a man (Penguin, Rs 99) by Mahesh Dattani is ? a stage play in two acts? and has been penned by India?s pin-up playwright. Dattani?s offering is an intricate examination of human relationships and the strengths and weaknesses that characterize them. In this book, the ageing Jairaj and his wife Ratna set up a meeting with Viswas, their prospective son-in-law, only to discover that there are some faultlines that are integral to relationships of both the young and the old.

Fit for 50+ (Orient, Rs 125) by 

Shane Gould is a ?beginner-friendly fitness program? written by ?the only 

person ever...to hold every world freestyle swimming record...simultaneously?. 

The exercise regime is not for everyone though. It is only meant to bring a spring 

in the steps of women in their fifties. Gould?s information is undoubtedly useful. 

Not many would know that bladder control plays such an important role in any fitness 

programme. But one wonder if women who have survived five decades will have the 

energy to follow the rigorous regime prescribed by a former Olympian.

 Powers: Selections from New Left Review (Seagull, Rs 395) is a collection of essays written by some of the best minds. The book deals with a wide array of subjects ? from global politics to the world economy to protest movements. Like other volumes from New Left Review, this collection also lives up to the highest standards in literary research and criticism.

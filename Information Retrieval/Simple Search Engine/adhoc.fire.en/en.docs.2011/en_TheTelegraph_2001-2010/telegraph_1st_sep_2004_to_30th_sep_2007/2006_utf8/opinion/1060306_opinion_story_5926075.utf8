 CLEANING UP

 The Election Commission has a constitutional obligation to clean up the electoral system. Given the flaws in the system, the EC has to constantly devise new ways of meeting the challenge. What it has done for the coming elections to the Bengal assembly is clearly unprecedented. Never before did the state vote in five phases. Such a prolonged poll has been rare anywhere else in the country. Even the last elections in Bihar were held in four phases. The EC?s decision on Bengal is clearly not linked to law and order in the state. There are several other states where law and order are worse than in Bengal. It cannot have been influenced much by the new threat posed by Maoist rebels in parts of the state. Jharkhand, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh and even Tamil Nadu face worse Maoist threats. The EC?s move must be a response to the persistent allegations by the opposition parties about the left?s manipulation of the vote. That this is really so is proved by the reactions of former chief minister, Mr Jyoti Basu, who called the EC?s decision ?insulting to the people of Bengal? and of the state secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Mr Anil Biswas, who thought that the five-phase poll was ?unwarranted?.

 But, the decision shows a new resolve in the EC not only to make the elections free and fair but also to make them appear to be so. It would be factually wrong to argue that Bengal has been singled out for political reasons. Last month, the EC cancelled the entire elections to the Visakhapatnam assembly constituency in Andhra Pradesh after all the major contestants were found to have sought to buy votes with money and liquor. If the move on Bengal looks unusual, so have been the complaints about the elections in the state. It is not that the EC has pronounced a verdict either way on the validity of these allegations. But, the least it could do was try out untested methods in order to clear the air. It cannot be a good omen for Bengal or any other state if the people lost their faith in the EC?s ability to conduct fair elections or in their ability to exercise their franchise freely. 

 Much the same argument holds for the EC?s directives to the parties not to deface the walls of public and residential buildings with election graffiti. This is not the first time that the EC has sought to curb this practice by the parties. But, as with other restrictions, the parties have so far treated them in a cavalier fashion. Only superficially, it is a question of defacing the walls. Far more important are the issues of election expenses and the infringement of people?s rights. For far too long, the parties have forced the common people to tolerate their excesses. Elections in India take on the spirit and colours of a carnival. It cannot be fun for the people if the games are played at the cost of their basic freedoms.

 Sixteen but not sweet

Glimpses (Script, Rs 125) by Bibhutibhusan Bandyopadhyay brings together a collection of short stories written by one of the most celebrated literary figures in Bengal. The translator, Sujal Bhattacharya, admits that the task of reproducing Bandyopadhyays writings in another language proved to be a challenging affair for two reasons.Firstly, Bandyopadhyays myriad style and wide repertoire make it difficult for critics to bracket him into a particular literary genre. The second reason is of a more personal nature. The author happens to be related to the translator, which has made it difficult for Bhattacharya to obtain a clear-sighted reading of his grandfathers works. The results, consequently, have been far from satisfactory. None of the translations quite captures the brilliance of Bandyopadhyays writing. The opening passage of The stock exchange Bhattacharyas rendering of Baksha Badal in English reveals the translators many failings: Having boarded the bus, Pratul got sure that he had chosen a bad day for setting off on a journey. Next day, schools and colleges would re-open after the Puja vacation that was why the bus was packed to the full leaving not an iota of space in it. This collection only goes to show that literary genes cannot be expected to be passed on from one generation to another on every ocassion.

 The politics of everyday life (Penguin, Rs 295) by Paul Ginsborg

 is a strongly-worded critique of modernity that prevails in the developed countries. This particular model of modernity, with its inbuilt tensions and discrepancies, is being cleverly exported to the rest of the world, leaving a large section of the global population with a sense of alienation and powerlessness. Ginsborg, however, points out that there is a solution to this malady and it lies in rethinking the choices that individuals make in the course of their daily life. A serious exploration of alternative avenues is the only way that can make it possible for civic society to arrest the movement towards collective disempowerment.

Vinitas dream nearly comes true when she manages to net an American hunk as her boyfriend, but she realizes soon enough that even dreams come at a price. In order to find out whether the young girl gets what she wants, the reader would have to leaf through this breezy, candid diary. A difficult task, if one has passed his teens.

 NOT THE END OF THE ROAD

 Gwynne Dyer

 Hamas won its surprise victory in last week?s parliamentary election in the occupied territories not because a majority of Palestinians are religious fanatics, or because they believe that Israel must be destroyed. It won because the old mainstream liberation movement, Fatah, had squandered its credibility in ten years of corrupt and incompetent rule in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and because after 39 years of Israeli military occupation, there is still no sign of a genuinely independent Palestinian state.

 There is actually a small ray of hope in Israel at the moment. The political demise of Ariel Sharon has changed the dynamics of Israeli politics, and there is a chance that the elections in March could produce a government that is prepared to enter into genuine negotiations with the Palestinians. Or rather, there was a chance, but most Israelis will see the victory of Hamas as evidence that Palestinians don?t want peace.

 Most Palestinians do want peace. They would quite like it if Israel were to vanish, but they have long been more realistic about what they would have to give up in a final peace settlement. For almost twenty years, Fatah?s demand has been for a state in the territories that Israel conquered in 1967, not the other three-quarters of colonial Palestine that they lost in the 1948 war.

 Peace process

 But Fatah has made almost no progress in its pursuit of that goal. Indeed, apart from the first three years after the Oslo accord of 1992, before the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, and a brief period when Ehud Barak was prime minister, there have hardly been any real peace negotiations. Instead, Israel has been convulsed by an endless internal debate about how much of the conquered land it has to give back in return for a permanent peace with the Palestinians.

 During this period the Jewish settler population in the occupied territories has grown five-fold, average Palestinian incomes have fallen by more than half, and still there has been no substantial progress towards a genuinely independent Palestinian state. So it is hardly surprising that parties like Hamas, which reject the whole Fatah strategy of compromise with Israel, have enjoyed growing support among despairing Palestinians.

 Be realistic

 Now the Palestinians have given Hamas a clear majority in the Palestinian parliament, and Prime Minister Ahmed Qureia and his Fatah-dominated cabinet have resigned. Hamas will form a government which will not include any Fatah members ? Fatah leaders are currently proclaiming that they would not join such a government ? and President Mahmoud Abbas, also from Fatah, has announced that he too may resign if he cannot pursue a peace policy. So is the ?peace process? dead?

 It certainly is for the moment. Hamas has reaffirmed that it has no intention of giving up the armed struggle against Israeli occupation (although its armed wing has largely respected the ceasefire negotiated with Israel a year ago), and that it has no intention of negotiating with Israel. 

 And yet there is always hope, because having genuine political power and responsibility for the results of exercising that power is a crash course in realism. Fatah made the journey from rejectionism to negotiation; it is not inconceivable that Hamas can do the same. It may just take more time than remains for the current peace process, which is already fourteen years old.

 But as Israeli general and politician, Moshe Dayan, once remarked: ?If you want to make peace, you don?t talk to your friends. You talk to your enemies.? A Palestinian government led by Hamas and the Israel government will end up negotiating one of these days. This is not the end of the road.

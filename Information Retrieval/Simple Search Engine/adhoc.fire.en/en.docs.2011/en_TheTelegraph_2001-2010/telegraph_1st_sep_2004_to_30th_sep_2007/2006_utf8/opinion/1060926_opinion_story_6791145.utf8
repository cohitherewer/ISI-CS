The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 THOUGHTS ON A WORLDWIDE EDUCATION MART

 In the third and final part of his essay, Tapas Majumdar takes up the commerce ministry paper on trade in education services in a GATS regime

 Nalanda university: a long tradition of exchange

 It was only after I finished writing for The Telegraph on Education in Twenty-first Century India Promises to keep, tasks left to do that I saw the commerce ministry paper on trade in education services in a GATS (general agreement on trade in services) regime. What kind of trade is this?

 Years ago, I might have wondered whether a compound word like education trade would not make a good example of an oxymoron. Looking at papers like this, I realize those years are gone. Thinking of it, I really do not regret that. For in some ways it is becoming increasingly important to emphasize that the market for the education services if that is the name you must give it very much exists. The point is, the education market or the knowledge market has, or should have, very little, perhaps only a tiny bit, of the daily bazaar in it and much more of the long-term and the very long-term markets of ideas and new skills, inventions, discoveries and new technologies.

 The best of such trade has been going on in India from long-lost past to the present day. It is this that has to be cherished. As it had in olden times, it can give us once again the material power and moral standing of a great nation. It is this vision and confidence that I find completely missing in what is presented as the GATS opportunity in the commerce ministry paper. The paper has no concern for, and shows no awareness of, the long-run and the very long-run economics of the knowledge market.

 I recently read a lecture by Sam Pitroda delivered at one of our oldest universities. Someone had sent me a copy to read. I thought what Pitroda says in the paragraph quoted below sums up beautifully what our great universities have as tasks cut out for them.

 There are no quick fixes. We must take risk and build leaders of tomorrow that we need. We must focus on revamping our higher education system. We must aim at the best of the best in the world. We must make India education capital. Look at our history we had Nalanda, we had Takshashila. Our diversity is a great tool to improve education. We offer lots-n-lots of opportunities but we are locked up in the recent past. I believe there are unique opportunities at this point in time to re-examine university education. Take some bold decisions, make some mistakes but move forward.

 Two stories came to mind at once. The first was that of Chanakya, or rather Kautilya (around 300 BC). His family lived in Pataliputra in Bihar. Kautilya and some of his friends went off to far away Takshashila university (todays Taxilla) for higher education and stayed on to teach there. Then they came back. That must have been quite a journey, by foot and bullock carts, along what we know as the Grand Trunk Road from Pataliputra to Taxilla and back. There are stories that Kautilya was of the Zoroastrian faith who had acquired a deep knowledge of the Greek and Persian civilizations but retained a fierce pride in Indian culture. He wrote his magnum opus, Arthashastra, in Sanskrit.

 The trade in education and knowledge that obviously took place between Persia, Greece and Magadh of this kind, and at that level, was to have a lasting influence on the Mauryan dynasty and on the Magadh empire that Kautilya had helped disciple Chandragupta to build. Kautilyas hold on Chandragupta was obviously much more than that of even Aristotle (384-322 BC), his near contemporary, on student Alexander the Great (356 323 BC).

 The second story was of Atisha Dipankara (982 1054), professor at Nalanda University, who around 1040 led a band of his students to Tibet to teach Buddhist philosophy and stayed on. Dipankara had probably almost permanently changed the character of civilization over parts of Asia.

 The commerce ministrys new consultation paper is called Higher Education in India and GATS: An Opportunity. Does it also visualize Indias engaging in trade in education of the kind Sam Pitroda, the chairman of the knowledge commission, had in mind? I see no convergence at all.

 Actually what the paper is asking us to look at are, qualitatively, very uncertain short-term imports and exports. Perhaps the paper can give some hope to students in India and other parts of south and south-east Asia who have the money and the inclination to buy marketable diplomas but cannot get admission to first-rate schools, colleges and universities anywhere on merit.

 I know that top-ranking institutions like Cambridge University, London School of Economics, Harvard and MIT all now have special India programmes and may not shrink from allowing a hint of their brand names appearing on the prospectus of some new institution in India for a consideration. Even the best of our own institutions like the Jawaharlal Nehru University or the Indian Institutes of Technology and Indian Institutes of Management may similarly be persuaded to sell a franchise. It may be being positive and helpful and socially useful; more likely, it may be trying to spread the rising cost. But it certainly would not be for advancement of learning (the motto the British chose for Calcutta University).

 In this context, a spokesman of the commerce ministry reportedly said, You cannot expect top-grade institutes like Harvard to come to India if you control salaries and fees. This sounds absolutely absurd! Does the ministry not know what the salary of a top-grade professor at Harvard or MIT or Cambridge, England could be, and the working conditions? 

 I know one each at the very top, teaching economics at these very places. I can guarantee not one of them would have money on his mind. Yet I cannot also believe any one of them being available at the kind of places the ministry might have in mind. In fact, I do not see very high salaries and excellent living conditions being able to induce even an assistant professor to spend a year working in India with an undistinguished faculty and students of uncertain motivation and ability. They would, however, be eager to come to the Delhi School of Economics or other such places where they almost never needed to be asked twice. That kind of trade has gone on for at least the last fifty years.

 The salaries of good teachers at good Indian universities should in any case be very much higher than what they are. That would not be for competing with Harvard salaries, but for allowing teachers to make two ends meet and also think of teaching and doing research in peace. Just to allow salaries only at the new franchises at the fantastic rates they quote at the coaching institutes nowadays may serve no other purpose than having more respectable versions of coaching institutes!

 Two short comments before I end. I spoke here of the higher education sector only. What about the other sectors? So far as children up to the age of 16 are concerned, the 86th amendment of the Constitution will be applicable and a GATS agreement cannot supersede it. Does the ministry accept this position? GATS cannot also supersede any of the sections of the Constitution on equality and social justice. The paper should have clearly shown how the ministry has satisfied itself that GATS would not do any such thing.

 Secondly, the paper has the following reassuring clause: However, we need to remember that public education services provided free of cost on a non-commercial basis and not in competition with other service suppliers is outside the purview of GATS. A comforting thought, but is there such an animal in the Indian jungle apart from our regulatory bodies? Surely all the institutions of education are included?

 CONCLUDED

 Letters to Editor

 KFC at Sabarmati

 Sir The photograph of Marlon Samuels, at the Sabarmati ashram was quite shocking (Sport, Oct 7). The West Indian cricketer is wearing a T-shirt promoting the multinational fast-food chain, KFC, while holding M.K. Gandhis autobiography in one hand. It is true that players have commercial obligations to keep, but surely the Sabarmati ashram of Gandhi could be spared the onslaught of KFC. I doubt whether Samuels knows much about Gandhis life or his teachings, but for Indians, any disrespect of Gandhi is painful.

 Yours faithfully,

Arvind Khanna, Dhanbad

 Too friendly

 Sir The general secretary of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Prakash Karat, if reports are to be believed, is going to ask the prime minister why a Chinese companys bid for building a port in Kerala has been stalled (Left arms for SEZ, China battles, Oct 4). It is hard to understand why a national party leader is holding cudgels for a foreign company, whose only achievement of any note is that it is building a naval base in a not-too-friendly neighbour. Is Karat not aware that ports are of strategic importance for any country whose details are better kept under wraps, particularly from hostile countries. India has already fought three wars and is still fighting a proxy war with Pakistan. Passing on information is quite possible if the same firm constructs ports in both countries. Or does Karat think that China, being a communist country, is like Caesars wife and can be trusted without question. 

 Yours faithfully,

S.B. Gupta, Calcutta

 Sir The left, in particular the CPI(M), is seriously concerned with the denial of permission to Chinese firms which want to set up ventures in India and participate in infrastucture development projects. The United Progressive Alliance government, on the advice of the concerned departments, has only followed norms established long ago and followed by all governments subsequent to the Chinese aggression in 1962. It appears that the security of the country and such issues are not at all important to the leftists. Or is the allegation that the CPI(M) and its allies are the agents of China in this country not baseless after all? What lends credence to this suspicion is that the Chinese ambassador in India took up the issue of denied permission with Prakash Karat instead of doing so directly with the Centre. The government should not yield to any pressure and let the security of the country be jeopardized.

 Yours faithfully,

A. Roy Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir It is true, as the editorial, Against reform (), points out, that in a liberalized economy, SEZs are an anachronism and creates significant economic distortions. Unfortunately, the political leadership (Kamal Nath et al) has assumed emotional ownership of the SEZs. At the recent IMF conference in Singapore, the Indian SEZs were criticized on economic grounds and reasons mentioned in the editorial. But criticisms upset our leaders. They should follow the Bengal governments footsteps and start admitting to mistakes.

 Yours faithfully,

Bhaskar Majumdar, Kuwait

 Parting shot

 Sir For the past few years, the local vendors in Haldia stop delivering newspapers from Saptami to Lakshmi Puja. I have worked in other parts of the country where Durga Puja is celebrated including Calcutta but papers are delivered on all days except the day after Dasami. The Telegraphs best Puja gift to its readers in Haldia would be to ensure the papers uniterrupted supply during the Puja next year. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sushyam Pal, Haldia

 Letters to Editor

 With some more respect

 Sir ? Why do all calls have to be ?clarion?? (? Clarion call to save the wall?, May 31). Indian English is respected worldwide but it has also become the butt of jokes for its predictabilities. Especially since journalists can never resist the temptation of ?rising like the Phoenix?. Another amusing usage is ?wee hours? in place of small hours. The former is a colloquial expression and should not be used in formal reportage. 

 Yours faithfully,

Aroup Chatterjee, London, UK

 Wealth is health

 Sir ? The Supreme Court should be lauded for taking action on the petition filed against the allegedly disproportionate assets of the Uttar Pradesh chief minister, Mulayam Singh Yadav (?Income whip on Mulayam?, June 8). If any irregularity is proved, the chief minister is liable to be arrested. This is also the time to get certain other things right. The exemption on agricultural or farm income may be abolished since it is misused by political rulers to cover up their black money. Reports on the electronic media indicate that the petitioner is being victimized by the state government authorities. The apex court should provide him adequate security and order an inquiry into the Lucknow Development Authority?s alleged cancellation of a property allotted to the petitioner.

 Yours faithfully,

S.C. Agrawal, Dariba

 Sir ? For a nation mired in corruption, the Supreme Court?s activism is welcome. There are other corrupt politicians like Mulayam Singh. The court and the Central Bureau of Investigation should systematically investigate the ill-gotten wealth of all these men and women.

 Yours faithfully,

D. Chakraborty, Toronto

 Sir ? From Om Prakash Chauthala to Lalu Prasad to Mulayam Singh, politics has served as a rich source of wealth for all of them. And yet, these men have always projected themselves as the messiah of the poor. But such men have thrived because voters turn a blind eye to their faults. 

 Yours faithfully,

Bhaskaranand Jha, Calcutta

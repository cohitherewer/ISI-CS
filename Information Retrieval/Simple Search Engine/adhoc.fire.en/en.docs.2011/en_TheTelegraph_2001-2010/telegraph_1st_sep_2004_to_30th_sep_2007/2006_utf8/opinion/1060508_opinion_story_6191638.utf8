 Extracts from the United Nations World Water Development Report 2, 2006

 There is no blueprint for improved governance. With social, political and economic preconditions as a base any society must find its own way of improving governance. Despite the variety in design and implementation of improved governance across the world, there are also certain characteristics of the water sector that must be taken into account... 

 Water is a renewable resource, as it reproduces itself through the hydrological cycle. While there is plenty of freshwater at the global scale, there is a challenge of having sufficient water, of the right quality, at the right place and at the right time. The nature of water resources is multi-purpose and hydrologically interconnected.

 Water is mainly considered a public good, but due to its multi-purpose nature, it is also at times an economic good. Importantly, water has economic, social and environmental value, which, among other things, calls for dialogue between water users and enhancement of participation and multi-stakeholder processes. 

 The provision of water-related services is often characterized as being close to monopoly situations, particularly for water supply and sanitation. This can limit the effectiveness of water markets and can also require regulated price ceilings to protect consumers from monopolistic power abuses.

 The capital-intensive nature of water-related infrastructure is often combined with low-cost recovery and heavy subsidization. Water infrastructure investment is also considered a ?sunk cost?, meaning that investments made to provide water services cannot be transferred or redeployed for other purposes, hence increasing capital investment risks. It is important to develop institutions and governance systems that can effectively respond to situations characterized by variability, risk, uncertainties and change. Conventional water planning remains rigid, and...it is critical to have the following items in mind... 

 Water sector reform goes hand-in-hand with overall governance reform. It is highly unlikely that more effective participation, transparency, and so on will take a firm root in the water sector, unless the country?s overall governance system allows it to do so. As a part of broadening the water agenda, there is an increasing need to harmonize and coordinate international water targets and principles with other international regimes, such as with global or regional trading regimes. 

 Unless water concerns are made part of broader national and international trade processes, stability and democratization, the chances of achieving the international water tar-gets remain difficult. There is thus a need to collaborate with new actors outside the water realm and to form more inclusive water development networks. 

 Water reform and implementation are progressing, although sometimes at a painstakingly slow pace. In many developing country settings, the water sector and its institutions are plagued by fragmentation, marginalization and low capacities. 

 Further, the marginalization of water departments and ministries in a country?s overall political affairs is the rule rather than the exception. International water targets and national Integrated Water Resource Management plans and policies mean little unless they are translated into legislation, institutional reform, participation implementation, sufficient funding, and so on. 

 Actions must be intensified towards the implementation of water policies and plans. Increased political commitment to implement existing water policies and legislation would go a long way towards achieving the international water targets. 

 The representation and participation of various interests in water decision-making is ... important. Decentralization without the right checks and balances may lead to local elites strengthening their positions at the expense of politically and economically marginalized groups. At present, more effective water institutions are yet to evolve in many countries. 

 Much of the conceptual development and division of roles and responsibilities among government agencies, private businesses and civil society tend to become mired in politics and do not reflect true on-the-ground needs. 

 Governments and donors should increasingly support the establishment of independent and strong regulatory authorities to facilitate enforcement of concessions or other types of arrangements between the public and private sectors. There should be increased efforts to strengthen regulatory capacities as well as to make them .

 CREDIT WHERE IT IS DUE

 The award of the Nobel Peace Prize for 2006 to Mr Muhammad Yunus has directly highlighted one important arena of activity. Mr Yunuss work, in its origins and in its impact, falls completely outside the scope of the state and its activity. In the third world or what is euphemistically called the developing world these days the state has been regarded as the principal engine of economic development. This was partially a fallout of the overwhelming influence of socialist planning in many of the developing countries. Another factor was historical: most anti-colonial struggles, which resulted in the creation of new and independent nation-states in Asia and Africa, aimed more at capturing state power than at the transformation of society. Consequently, most aspects of public life in these countries came to be state-driven and state-dependent. One very implication of this importance given to the state and its activities was the relative retardation of civil society and its institutions. This was in stark contrast to what had happened in the developed world. There, the growing significance of the institutions of civil society had preceded, in time and in the world of ideas, the rolling back of the frontiers of the state. 

 In Bangladesh, Mr Yunus, through his programme of providing micro-credit to the poor, has taken the project of development and poverty eradication away from the state. That project is now a non-state or non-government initiative. The transactions carried out by the Grameen bank are unique because they are based on trust. Mr Yunus has made the term creditworthiness, the byword of lending by big banks, completely irrelevant. He has shifted the emphasis from contract to trust. Through the network of micro-credit, he has made all borrowers into savers. By doing this, he has engendered a major transformation in the rural world of Bangladesh because he has enabled the poorest to be entrepreneurs and to take the first steps towards removing the humiliating condition of poverty. Since a large majority of the borrowers from the Grameen Bank are women, the latter have become more empowered than they were ever before. What is of profound significance is that this socio-economic transformation has taken place independent of the state or the government.

 Mr Yunus, willy nilly, has created an institution within the civil society of Bangladesh which now acts as the principal agent of economic change. This achievement acquires a greater salience because Bangladesh is a country where the civic-social institutions are particularly fragile. The frontiers of the state may not have been rolled back in Bangladesh but Mr Yunuss work has carved out a sphere outside the domain of the state which is absolutely critical for the development of the economy and the society of Bangladesh. This is why the model of micro-credit has relevance beyond the borders of Bangladesh. In intellectual terms, Mr Yunuss work has shifted the focus away from the state to institutions in society.

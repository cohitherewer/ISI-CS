 Terror at large

 Sir ? We are seeing in Lebanon a repeat of what happened earlier in Afghanistan and then Iraq. The US has been replaced in this case by Israel, although the former continues to be the latter?s chief mentor. In the early days of the present conflict, Israel claimed that the Hizbollah and Hamas are directly responsible for going against the spirit of moderation in west Asia. Not that Israel embodies the qualities of an ideal ?moderate? state. If Israel were removed from the region, then moderation and peace would return with immediate effect. In the face of a humanitarian crisis in west Asia, does the US and Israel look as if they are working towards a negotiated peace? 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Gwynne Dyer, in his article, ?With full force? (July 24), refers to the French president?s comment that Israel was resorting to ?disproportionate use of force? on Lebanon. But hasn?t Dyer heard that all is fair in love and war? War is not a game of chess that every player will be given one opportunity to advance one step and kill one of the opponents? men. War is a serious business where the idea is to kill as many of the enemy soldiers as possible. Grievously offended by the Muslim nations? cry that Israel has no right to exist, Israel had no option but to resort to this exemplary retaliation .

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? Israel has gone overboard in punishing Palestinians for the actions of the elected Hamas. And now it has even launched an audacious attack on Lebanon. These are in grave violation of the Geneva Convention, so much so that some of the nations which do not have diplomatic links with Palestine have also expressed concern. In this context, the silence of the Indian government is not acceptable. Standing up for what is right should not affect our ?traditional? ties with Israel.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? In the last few weeks, the Israeli army has launched a series of attacks on Palestinian civilian infrastructure, including bridges, water supply facilities and Gaza?s only power station. Given that international humanitarian aid to Palestine is also currently witheld, the country faces an acute humanitarian crisis. Israel also engineered the abduction of leading members of Hamas. These actions go directly against the norms of sovereignty and international law. Israel justifies its action as an attempt to recover its soldier, abducted by a small Palestinian militant group. In fact, Israel has terrorized the whole of the Arab world. The only real solution to the cycle of violence and humanitarian crisis is the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Israeli forces back to the borders of 1967, the full independence and sovereignty of Palestine, with its capital in East Jerusalem and the resolution of the refugee problem according to the relevant UN resolutions. Only the mutual recognition of Israel and Palestine as two independent, equal states can end the catastrophe. 

 Leaders of Hamas and Fatah have discussed a new proposal in Palestine, developed by Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. While this proposal did not address all the important issues of the occupation, it is still an important step toward ending attacks on civilians by both sides. The Israeli government should immediately stop trying to control life in the West Bank and Gaza. Else, there is no hope of peace in the region.

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? I wonder why we are so eager to denounce Israel. Its military action against an aggressive, hostile militia called Hizbollah, functioning illegally from a country which does not belong to it, should instead be applauded. Indians critical of Israel must know that Hizbollah are functioning in total defiance of the UN resolution 1559 that asked them to disarm and disband. In fact, Israel should serve as a model for India which is surprisingly passive in suffering the organized killing of its citizens by Islamic terrorists, looking at the US to solve its problems. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir ? The victims of 20th-century Nazi oppression have proved that they are no different from their oppressors by turning a narrow strip of land in west Asia into a concentration camp and a free shooting zone. Such is Israel?s racism that it has no qualms in saying that human life is not cheap to the Israelis but quite cheap on the other side, just as the Nazis used to say. The so-called ?international community?, are, as usual, economical with the truth, watching with glee as their satrapy, which never complied with any UN security council resolution, goes about destroying a sovereign state because one UN resolution was not ?fully? complied with by that country. But where is the outrage against this brutal racism and war crimes by that aspirant to the security council high table, India?

 Yours faithfully, 

 G.P. Ray,

 Sir ? Every Indian news channel and paper has quoted Koffi Annan?s speech accusing Israel of disproportionate response to the Hizbollah activities, refusing to quote the part in which Annan criticizes Hizbollah. The leftists in India have been demanding sanctions against Israel. By the same logic, shouldn?t they also demand that the borders with Bangladesh be sealed, since Bangladesh is the hub of anti-India Islamic militancy?

 Yours faithfully,

 CARD GAMES

 Certain things can be both absurd and sinister. The discovery that there are more ration cards than human beings in West Bengal may have come as no extraordinary surprise to the inhabitants of the state, but countable proof of this absurdity is bound to be unsettling. It suggests activity ? or inefficiency ? that is nothing short of sinister in its effects. With 29 years of rule in its kitty, the Left Front, particularly the Communist Party of India (Marxist), cannot blame anybody else that most of the complaints by opposition parties are turning out to be true. The direct link between ration cards and voters? lists makes the government and its officials guilty of fraud. It needed a determined Election Commission to start a statewide inquiry. By going from door to door himself, the EC adviser, Mr K.J. Rao, and other special observers have been able to create the impression that the EC will stop at nothing in its power to ensure ?free and fair? elections in the state. The task seems enormous ? examining all the complaints of both the opposition and the ruling parties. Besides, exposing the existence of false ration cards is one thing, ensuring that the fictitious names are struck off the voters? lists is quite another. At the moment, the various government departments concerned have taken refuge in vagueness: the food department is so busy striking off false ration cards, it does not know whether the same names are being struck off the voters? lists. Lack of coordination can be projected as a comparatively innocent bureaucratic failing; it may actually work in obscuring complicity in leaving voters? lists unchanged. 

 It is difficult to believe in the innocent surprise of the administration. Everybody knows everybody in the Bengal villages, and the gram panchayat keeps a hawk?s eye on all. How can errors be made on this scale and the wrong cards continue to exist for years? Cleaning up the lists and ensuring that the trick is not repeated seem to be the first task. But extra ration cards for some mean deprivation for many: the misuse of ration cards of the underprivileged by local dealers and simply the absence of cards among numerous families in the hungriest districts. The EC?s exposure has shown up a deep corruption in the public distribution system and has, inevitably, raised serious questions about the system of distribution of BPL cards. The really poor have been complaining for a long time. Another investigation seems to be urgently necessary.

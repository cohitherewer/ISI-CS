 Letters to Editor

 Policy play

 Sir ? The Union human resource development minister, Arjun Singh, is playing the OBC card only to strengthen his wobbly Congress party. I am a beneficiary of the quota system and so are my brothers. However, I feel guilty thinking that I got my job depriving somebody more meritorious. This is no way to cure social ills. Had my father, a painter in the Indian Airlines, enough money to take care of his large family, I would have had a better education and competed on an equal footing with others. I want dignity first. I do not want to be looked down upon by those ? many of whom are from poor families themselves ? who have lost out on opportunities because of the reservations policy.

 Yours faithfully,

M. Vedanta Rao, Ahmedabad

 Sir ? By providing 49.5 per cent reservations in premier educational institutes like the IIMs and IITs, the Congress has once again tried to resort to caste and class politics. The IIMs and the IITs demand academic academic excellence. These institutions will lose their distinction if reservations come into effect. It is not that reservations are altogether unjustified, but they should be based solely on economic grounds. The policy, as it stands now, only helps certain mediocre students to get a backdoor entry without having to put in hard work. The biggest damage that reservations have done is that it has actively discouraged even the meritorious students from the scheduled castes to realize their potential.

 Yours faithfully,

Abhinandan Mishra, Calcutta

 Sir ? The reservations policy is a big failure since it has not been able to harmonize the different castes and reduce inequality in the stipulated fifteen years that the Constitution-makers originally gave it. In fact, it has further alienated the reserved classes and castes from the mainstream by assigning a separate identity to them. To help India become a developed nation, reservations should be extended only to families with two children or less. 

 Yours faithfully,

Subhash C. Agrawal, Delhi

 Sir ? Arjun Singh is not keeping well and we know that the prime minister is weak and infirm. This is the right time to pass a legislation that only a panel of doctors who qualified for the medical entrance tests in the reserved category should treat all members of parliament and their families. An MP or his kin should not be allowed to travel abroad or consult a doctor from the general category. After all, MPs ought to instil confidence and equality among the backward communities.

 Yours faithfully,

Udita Agrawal, New Delhi

 Sir ? To offset the decrease in the number of general seats in the IITs and IIMs following Arjun Singh?s new brainwave, a further increase of 54 per cent in the total number of seats has been proposed. However, this may not be logistically possible for all institutes. This is sure to have a serious impact on the job market. Some students may even try to procure fake OBC certificates. Why not start a special institution with a placement cell for the backward castes, which could provide training to upgrade the skills and competence of students from the reserved classes.

 Yours faithfully,

Suchi Arya, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is amusing that the government is eager to provide reservations for the backward castes in premier institutions like the IITs and the IIMs forgetting that those from the target sections have to complete primary, secondary and higher secondary education before they can dream of reaching these institutions. Are there schools in rural India where the OBCs can get the quality of education that is required to enter the IITs and the IIMs? There are many among the OBCs who can afford to send their children abroad for higher education, just as there are many upper-caste families who struggle to get two square meals a day. Practically speaking, there are only two classes in society ? the rich and the poor. The government?s duty is to help the poor man, no matter what caste or class he belongs to. 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The idea of extending the ambit of the reservations policy is politically motivated. Besides widening social rifts, the proposed move would also lead to the decline of some of our premier educational institutions. Increasing the number of seats is impractical, since it would affect the faculty-to-student ratio. The problem with the Indian education system is that there is a wide range of opportunities at the top but almost none at the bottom. Reservations over-burden the top. More schemes like the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan are needed to correct this imbalance. If reservations had been successful, the quota system would have become redundant by now, since the OBCs would have gained enough social mobility. 

 Yours faithfully,

Anurag Gupta, Calcutta

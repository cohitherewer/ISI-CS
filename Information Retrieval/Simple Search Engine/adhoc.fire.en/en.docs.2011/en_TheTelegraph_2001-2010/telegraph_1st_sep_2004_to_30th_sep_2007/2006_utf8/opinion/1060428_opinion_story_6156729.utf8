 Building the great divide

 Secularism, Communalism and the Intellectuals (Three Essays, Rs 125) by Zaheer Baber is a literary work of considerable importance which attempts to identify the contributions of prominent intellectuals in creating spaces and conditions for ?mainstreaming communalism? in the Indian context. Baber directs her ire at some of India?s prominent sociologists for their unqualified support for ?indigenous traditions? and Hindutva, and their attempts to vilify secular and democratic forces. There have been numerous attempts to document the factors responsible for the rise of communalism in India. Baber?s book widens the focus of this investigation by exposing the contribution of the intellectual community in strengthening the forces that divide us.

 Imagined Hinduism: British Protestant Missionary Constructions of Hinduism, 1793-1900 (Sage, Rs 450) by Geoffrey A. Oddie draws upon the writing of missionaries during the raj to explore their construction of Hinduism. The ideas were never static ? early descriptions of a pagan religion gave way to a more compassionate approach in the late 19th century, which led to a revision in the unitary model.This fascinating piece of writing would surely be of use to scholars interested in the interplay between Indian society and the religious forces.

 The Twelfth Card (Hodder amp; Stoughton, ? 6.90) by Jeffery Deaver tells us about a school girl?s research project which delves into a murky past that hides a terrible secret. At the same time, a ruthless killer stalks Geneva, and when a criminalist and a policewoman team up to nab the killer, they discover that the trail of blood leads them back to the same buried secret. Those who swear by thrillers will love the intrigue, the dangerous twists, and the pace of Deaver?s new novel.

 Creepers (Headline, ? 6.00) by David Morrell is supposedly a book that ?grabs you by the short hairs of your soul...and does not let you go?. A group of urban explorers called Creepers enter a decrepit hotel, only to discover that the building holds more secrets than they would care to discover. It is difficult to imagine why some people would be interested in smelly, old buildings. Morrell may have an answer, but one doubts if the reader would really want to know.

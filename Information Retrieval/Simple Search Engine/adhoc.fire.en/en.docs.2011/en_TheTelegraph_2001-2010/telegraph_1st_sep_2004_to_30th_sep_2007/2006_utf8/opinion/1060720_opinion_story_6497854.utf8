 ON CHANGING TASTES, FASHIONS AND DESIRES

 ldquo;Yes, women have a special affinity for gold jewellery, rdquo; said Subir Sen, director, B.C. Sen Jewellers, in answer to our question regarding women rsquo;s love of gold. Heritage, and the ldquo;high sense of value attributed to gold in our society increases the affinity rdquo;. Men, he says, ldquo;love gold...[probably] more as a point of investment. rdquo;

 Adornment is not far from investment: ?The consumer considers buying jewellery a safe investment, for it is also readily encashable. Compared to other avenues of investment, the liquidity factor for gold jewellery investment is far greater, since it can be encashed most easily.?

 Why are there so many new shops and advertisements? 

 ?This can be attributed to the constant increase in outlets and added retailers, who are new- ly entering the gold jewellery trade. As competition increases... contemporary units in the business want to reach out to consumers through advertisements... to mark a presence and register their name and product profile.? 

 In Indian culture, Sen says, ?gold has a special value?. But in the West, ?people wear gold for fashion and therefore, use low-caratage jewellery?. There jewellery is treated like a consumer item on a fixed price basis. But here gold jewellery has high-caratage and is also valued by the content of the metal, leading to a variable price.? 

 But some things are changing too. Sen sees that there is now an ?increased fashion consciousness?: ?Nowadays, people do not buy jewellery just to keep it in bank vaults. They buy select jewellery to wear more frequently, matching the occasion.? 

 The challenge is to be creative, blending the old with the new, playing about with chic and retro-chic. Raj Mahtani, proprietor, Satramdas Dhalamal, says that their trademark is heavy yet avant-garde jewellery. The traditional 24-carat gold is not malleable. With changed tastes, the most used gold is 22-carat, which can be more easily designed. 

 The incursion of platinum and diamond jewellery has compelled new thinking in designs. Mahtani?s forte is the revival of ancient Indian art forms. But he has to combine ?the flavour of the old with a feeling of the new?. 

 Gold is still the most widely bought. Wealthier people would buy more diamond and platinum than gold, says Sen. ?People in the lower income levels buy more gold jewellery. So, the pattern of product mix changes with the level of income.? 

 Buying jewellery is about aspirations, says Mahtani. Among middle-class Indians, aspirations have undergone a sea-change in the last decade. Diamonds, once out of reach for them, are now affordable. This is true even for Bengalis, who have been traditionally loyal to gold. Mahtani thinks there has been a 20-25 per cent swing away from gold jewellery in the last few years. 

 Aspirations have no gender.

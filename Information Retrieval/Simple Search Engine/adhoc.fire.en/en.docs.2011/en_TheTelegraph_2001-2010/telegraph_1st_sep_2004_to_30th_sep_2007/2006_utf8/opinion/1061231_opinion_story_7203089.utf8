The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 SLOW BUT MOVING WELL

 An extraordinary year is unique. An ordinary year is distinguished by the specific features of its ordinariness. These specific features need to be picked out from the events that made the year that ends today. One of these events is the growth of the economy at 8 per cent per annum. There is also the prediction that the economy will continue to maintain this growth. It might well be asked why this is not being acknowledged as an event that made the year extraordinary. The answer is not a complicated one. The Indian economy has been poised to growth at around this rate ever since it was unshackled from the coils of socialism and planning. The 8 per cent growth, and its continuity, is a culmination of a process. In that sense, the registering of this growth is not entirely unexpected. Therefore, it is not also entirely out of the ordinary. It was an achievement long foretold. The other aspect to recall is the entry of private capital into spheres that were considered sacred to the public sector. The maintenance of airports is one such example. The airports of both Delhi and Mumbai have been handed over to private companies. There is a greater recognition that, for economic development, private enterprise should have a greater role to play while the state retreats. This again is a significant development but it is the working out of a logic that began to unfold with the onset of economic reforms and liberalization.

 In the realm of politics, the two major political parties, the Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party, showed a pronounced tendency to retreat to their original positions. The Congress to populism and the BJP to Hindutva. Both parties chose the known and well-trodden road and decided to speak to the converted. This caused no surprise. The government, however, scored a point in diplomacy. It issued two joint statements with the government of the United States of America to prepare the ground for a new nuclear understanding between the two countries. The US legislature also passed a legislation that enables the US government to actually sign such a deal with India. This is the first sign that Washington is willing to welcome India to come and sit at the high table of international relations. Most observers will say, without belittling the Indo-US deal, that an important Indo-US partnership has long been on the cards. The emergence of China and the threat of Islamic fundamentalism have made such a partnership a distinct possibility even before the Indo-US deal. In fact, the latter is a manifestation of the process.

 India in 2006 has thus walked along a well-charted path. Many would have preferred the pace of the walk to be faster but hardly anybody is surprised at the direction of the walk. A retreat would have been extraordinary in negative terms, a sprint, even in the right direction, uncalled for. The tortoise, as the fable says, will win the race.

 TO KEEP THE HOME FIRES BURNING

 SHOT IN THE DARK

 The Indian gender tragedy will continue, law or no law

 A columnist with this newspaper has recently been bombarded with hate-mail of the most obnoxious variety imaginable. Her crime was speculation as to why the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act was making men hysterical with fear. Looking beyond the expletives these paragons of the stronger sex rained on her, it seems that what had hit these poor men hard (though one doesnt know exactly where) was an alleged insult to manhood. A possessor of such manhood, in fact, threatened to take her to court. Others, presumably more conspicuously manly, fantasized shooting her. 

 But, pampered and paranoid masculinity need not worry after all. The great Indian gender tragedy is likely to continue unabated, law or no law. Every law is subject to sets of binaries primarily, those of making the law and implementing it. With all its elaborate provisions, the act will simply fail to book countless offences in every Indian city, small town and village. Because the victims lack awareness, because they are scared, and since there is every possibility of their being more abused if they lodge a complaint. 

 The National Crimes Report Bureau claims that 1.5 lakh crimes against women are registered annually, about 50,000 of which concern domestic violence in one form or another. Almost five crore women are subject to violence at home, but the Peoples Union of Civil Liberties says that only 0.1 per cent dare to report. Prior to the legislation, only two per cent of the accused would be convicted. In 2004, about 44 per cent of reported rapes were committed indoors, and 5.6 per cent of the victims were violated by relatives. More than 140,000 incidents were reported under the categories of torture, dowry harassment and cruelty. PUCL statistics show that, on an average, 132 women are abused by their husbands and/or in-laws everyday in India, that is, five women every hour; there are 18 dowry deaths daily, in other words, one woman dies every 80 minutes of dowry-related torture. 

 Men can, therefore, after a hiatus (at the most), go back to the historic sport of wife-beating. They shouldnt worry, since women who knock their husbands eye out in a fit of rage number a handful. There are women around waiting to pounce upon men and their families to serve their own interests by abusing the law. But these ones, too, are a minuscule minority. They are easily lost sight of in a society rapidly going downhill on the gender ratio and where economic changes have affected value-systems.

 The male of the species believes it is a law unto itself. Therefore, it is not enough to make a law, to add a few chapters to academic curricula, or to pursue a fanatic political correctness at the university. We need a change of heart. We need a transformation of our moral and human universe to give women what, after millennia of patriarchy, they are still struggling to get. For the moment, we must overlook the exceptions when men are at the receiving end. India has a long way to go before women have even a fifty per cent hold on anything. Unprovoked, uncalled-for browbeating in the name of male superiority must be judged and condemned. The horror is how it is all assumed to be normal. We accept too much and compromise with evil too often. Manhood be damned, it is time to write a new script.

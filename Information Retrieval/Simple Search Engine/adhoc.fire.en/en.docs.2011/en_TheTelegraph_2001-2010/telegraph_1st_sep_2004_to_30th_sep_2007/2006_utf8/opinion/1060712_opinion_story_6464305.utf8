The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 FIRST QUARTER

 The corporate results for the first quarter of 2006-07, which have started coming in, hold more than the usual significance this time. This is because investors will be keenly watching to find out whether the rise in interest rates on the one hand, and in oil and commodity prices on the other, has had an impact on earnings. The market, already buffeted by the withdrawal of liquidity, could be in for a further correction if the corporate results disappoint. It is interesting, therefore, to find out what exactly are the expectations from the results. The consensus seems to be for an earnings growth of between 20 and 25 per cent, after adjusting for one-off extraordinary factors. That is not too bad, given the fact that earnings growth for the Sensex companies was around 19 per cent last fiscal. As a matter of fact, the much-awaited slowdown in earnings growth materialized last year because Sensex earnings growth was at its peak of 37 per cent in 2004-05. What remains to be seen is whether the pressure on margins has been offset by higher volumes and whether earnings growth is still robust enough to warrant the current Sensex valuation of around 19 times trailing earnings.

 So far, the expectation is that consumer demand is unlikely to be affected, with the cement sector expected to show extraordinarily high growth, thanks to both price and volume increases. Growth in the fast moving consumer goods sector should continue to be robust on the back of a pick up in rural demand and a return of pricing power. The auto sector too is expected to do well because of strong volume growth. In short, rising interest rates for consumer loans are not expected to have a significant impact on consumer demand. The bulging order books of engineering companies also rule out any slackening of growth in investment demand. On the services front, IT companies? bottomlines will be boosted by the depreciation of the rupee during the June quarter. IT stocks have seen defensive plays during the downturn in the markets. The negative impact of higher interest rates, however, is expected to hit the banking sector hard, with mark-to-market losses on account of rising bond yields going up substantially. Also, the rise in deposit costs may have an impact on their net interest margins. Commodity players in the non-ferrous sector should show strong earnings but steel companies may not, because prices have corrected substantially from a year ago. Going forward, with global liquidity continuing to be tight, stock market returns will increasingly reflect the growth in corporate earnings.

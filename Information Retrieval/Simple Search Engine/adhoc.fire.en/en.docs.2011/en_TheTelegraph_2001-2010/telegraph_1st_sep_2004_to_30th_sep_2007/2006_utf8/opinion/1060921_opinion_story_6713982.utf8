 Blind faith

 Sir The incident involving Nobo Kumar Mondol at Loreto Convent school, Lucknow, is rather baffling (Jesus at Loreto show, Bajrang bristles, Sept 11 and Cautious on Loreto, Sept 12). The nuns at the school acted irresponsibly by inviting an occultist to perform in the school. Mondol, a rickshawpuller from Bengal, reportedly heads the Chandra cult and allegedly is in cahoots with Father Sebastian Kuzhipala of Murshidabad. He was invited to Loreto at Kuzhipalas behest. What Mondol did at the retreat arranged for the students of Loreto dancing, hopping and finally fainting in divine frenzy, was clearly a performance aimed at captivating the audience of young girls. It is disgraceful that the school principal, Sister Monica, allowed the show to be executed inside an educational institution.

 However, the activists of the Bajrang Dal who vandalized the school premises need to be censured equally. Christian missionaries and schools are often at the receiving end of violence committed by Hindu fundamentalists. While churches are demolished to make way for highways in Calcutta, a missionary and his innocent children are burnt alive in Orissa. These unfortunate incidents will not cease unless the government takes upon itself the responsibility of protecting the minorities. If the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Mulayam Singh Yadav, can send his granddaughter to study in Loreto Convent, then why cant he ensure that Christians are treated like those belonging to any other community? 

 Yours faithfully, 

 John Ambat,

 Sir If the principal of one of Lucknows most prestigious schools had invited Nobo Kumar Mondol with the purpose of influencing students to convert to Christianity, then it is an act which violates the childrens right to religious freedom. And, as such, it deserves to be criticized unsparingly. The government of West Bengal must keep a strict watch on the whereabouts of the Chandra cult, which is reportedly headed by Mondol, so that his followers do not get the chance to indulge in subversive activities here.

 Yours faithfully, 

 A.S. Mehta,

 Sir It is shocking that a premier educational institution can encourage superstitious practices in the name of religion. Worse, in this particular case, the occultist targeted young children who are vulnerable and have an impressionable mind. The perpetrators need to be strongly criticized and punished. The act of vandalism carried out by Bajrang Dal activists is equally objectionable. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Sukanta Das, 

 Calcutta

 Sir The recent attack by Bajrang Dal activists inside the Loreto Convent school deserves to be condemned in the strongest possible terms. As the chief minister of the state, Mulayam Singh Yadav should take it upon himself to order a probe into the incident and bring the culprits to book. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 R. Sekar, 

 Nalco Nagar, Orissa 

 Sir The incident at Loreto Convent in Lucknow should serve as a warning to the authorities of those missionary schools in India that often pressurize children belonging to other faiths to convert to Christianity. Schools should confine their activities to imparting a sound education and ethical values. 

 They have no right to interfere with the religious beliefs of the students. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 P. Renganathan,

 Deadly fumes

 Sir The editorial, Dangerous City (Sept 12), presents a rather grim picture of the worsening pollution levels in Calcutta. It is horrifying to learn that childhood asthma resulting from atmospheric pollution is causing nearly 24 per cent of the citys school children to miss their classes every month. One wonders what happened to the state governments slogans which promised health for all citizens by the end of the decade. The failure of the state government in checking pollution is truly deplorable. The Central Pollution Boards declaration that the city ranks first in air pollution among all the other metros should have put Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to shame. But he and his ministers seem indifferent to the plight of citizens. Even after the revelation of the alarming statistics, plans to check pollution have not been taken. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 Debasish Chatterjee, 

 Calcutta

 Sir With the pollution in Calcutta reaching alarming levels, the state government should take the blame for failing to implement the checks required to clean the citys air. Government apathy has also led to the deterioration of the health of young children. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee should take a break from matters concerning Singur and start implementing the directives of the CPB. 

 Yours faithfully, 

 T.R. Anand, 

 Calcutta

 Sir The administration should make a serious attempt to minimize the average repairable particulate matter in the atmosphere of Calcutta. The RPM needs to be brought down to the permissible standard of 60 micrograms per cubic metre right away. The high level of pollution in the city makes each and every inhabitant particularly vulnerable to dangerous diseases of the lungs and pulmonary tract. In this context, it should be mentioned that children are already suffering from asthma as a result of pollution. Isnt it time the government starts acting to rid Calcutta of the poison?

 Yours faithfully, 

 Hemanta Kumar Dutta, 

 Howrah

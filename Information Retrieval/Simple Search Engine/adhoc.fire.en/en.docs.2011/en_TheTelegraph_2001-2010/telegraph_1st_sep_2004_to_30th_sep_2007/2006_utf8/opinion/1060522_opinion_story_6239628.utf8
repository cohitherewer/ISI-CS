 Letters to Editor

 With hands tied

 Sir ? The huge mandate that the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has received is one for change and based mainly on Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s pro-reform, pro-industrialization image (?Change proves hard for CPM?, May, 17). On the other hand, Jyoti Basu has been responsible for all that has gone wrong with Bengal for the last 30 years and the reason why sweeping changes are required. Constant interference on the part of the CPI(M) patriarch and the undemocratic role that he assumes in the workings of the state government can only bring him into conflict with the present chief minister. It should not be forgotten that Jyoti Basu is no longer an elected representative of the people and, therefore, has no moral right to carry on jeopardizing Bhattacharjee?s agenda. The CPI(M) must clean its own house, and charity must begin at Alimuddin Street.

 Yours faithfully,

Bhaskar Majumdar, Kuwait

 Sir ? It is a pity that the CEO of West Bengal cannot get the team he wants or deserves (?Buddha gets Basu team?, May 18). The tragedy of Bengal is the hold its sad past has on it. Thus, the man responsible for ruining Bengal over nearly twenty years, who formally relinquished office six years ago, still insists on calling the shots and gets away with it. It is dangerous for the passengers when the driver has only the rear-view mirror to assist him. A number of ministries need change but there is not likely to be any improvement in certain crucial sectors where the performance of the incumbents has been pathetic for a long time. 

 Yours faithfully,

Rupnarayan Bose, Calcutta

 Sir ? Although Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee won the battle against his political rivals, he seems to have lost to his own men in selecting his cabinet. Despite our high hopes about the composition of the new ministry, the Left Front has gone back to square one in the end. Particularly, the selection of the minister for information technology has been a big disappointment. It can only send out the wrong signals at a time when the state is trying its best to woo IT companies. The new IT minister may be more capable than his predecessor, but he is a greenhorn. Furthermore, given the governmental initiative for the re-industrialization of the state, a pro-active reformist should have been chosen as the minister for industries. Finally, the public had expected that the incumbent health minister?s failure would have led to him being shown the door, but here too, all hopes for change have been dashed.

 Yours faithfully,

Raj Bagri, Calcutta

 Sir ? It is beyond doubt that the left?s thumping majority is owing to ?Buddhanomics?. Therefore, one was surprised to see Jyoti Basu actively picking candidates and allocating portfolios according to his choice, thereby shattering Bhattacharjee?s dream of a young and dynamic team. Since he easily climbs the steps of the Alimuddin street office even today and remains just as media-savvy, one wonders why the rejuvenated, agile and alert Basu does not come out of retirement and lead the state for another term. That way he can be closer to his blue-eyed boys and spare the state his rule by proxy. Bhattacharjee can revert to the role of deputy chief minister or call for a special cabinet with Basu as a super chief minister. 

 Yours faithfully,

A.S. Mehta, Calcutta 

 Sir ? Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has rued the state of public health services in West Bengal often in the recent past and made health a priority for his new government. Public health in Bengal has had a long and nasty fall. Today, even the lower end of the middle class will not hear of going to a government hospital for treatment. The cost of treatment in private hospitals robs many families of their integrity and solvency. Things were different at the time of independence and even in the Fifties and Sixties. Back then, people of all classes sought the big hospitals in Calcutta and they had complete faith in the doctors and the facilities. Even the health centres in the rural areas of West Bengal were hubs of activity ? in the very districts that are now in the grip of political extremists. There was an abundance of doctors and nurses and no dearth of beds. From a professional perspective, the long queues of patients were very encouraging. Besides, the hospitals and health centres run by the state were kept clean and hygienic. The media reports these days on the dilapidated and deplorable conditions of these centres are heart-rending. As Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee installs his new government, both the ministers and the public should keep in mind their shared responsibility in reversing this long process of decline. Bhattacherjee?s failure to get the cabinet of his choice is not encouraging for the people. In spite of this setback, there is still time for the government to transform the wishes of the people expressed through the electoral mandate into reality. Public expectations are high and justifiably so. 

 Yours faithfully,

K.B. Goswami, Calcutta

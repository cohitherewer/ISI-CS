 ZONES OF CONTROVERSY 

 - SEZs are increasingly becoming synonymous with land grabbing

 More than 15 months after the Special Economic Zones Act was passed in Parliament, the country is in the midst of a raging debate on SEZs. Debashis Bhattacharyya reports on the rumpus

 At crossroads: CPM leader Sitaram Yechury addresses a farmers rally to protest the acquisition of their land by Reliance Industries to set up a Special Economic Zone in Navi-Mumbai 

 The road to Bantala is certainly not paved with the proverbial gold. If anything, it is pitted with gaping potholes and jolting bumps. But today, in some uncanny ways, the ride to the South 24 Parganas town, housing one of the special economic zones (SEZs) in Bengal, resembles the countrys epic journey from export processing zones (EPZs) to SEZs both equally bumpy. 

 More than 15 months after the Special Economic Zones Act was passed in Parliament and seven months after it took effect, the country is in the midst of a raging debate on SEZs specially delineated duty free enclaves deemed foreign territory as far as trade, duties and tariffs are concerned, as a commerce ministry notification puts it. Its not so much about whether India should have special economic zones, but whether it can afford SEZs, as specified by the contentious Act. And this Great Indian Debate is as much political as social and economic. 

 Clearly, few economic issues in recent times have raised such hackles or stirred up so many objections as the Centres policy on SEZs. Politicians, businessmen and social activists are all railing against SEZs, not as an economic concept as such to build world class infrastructure but for the way the Union commerce ministry has depicted it in the 2005 SEZ Act. 

 But while economists and other experts slug it out at the Centre, there is trouble brewing in rural India. Political parties and social activists fear displacement of hundreds of farmers as companies scramble for vast tracts of land to set up SEZs in what historian Sumit Sarkar says could become the biggest land grab movement in the history of modern India. Ironically, the Congress, which leads the ruling coalition at the Centre and can be held responsible for the SEZ policy, is perturbed since displacement of farmers could be politically costly, particularly in the Hindi heartland. 

 We are concerned, says Digvijay Singh, former Madhya Pradesh chief minister and a Congress general secretary. Industrial units outside the SEZs should be provided with a level playing field in some form or the other. Those losing their land should also be made stakeholders in the SEZ projects, he says. 

 The issue threatens to engulf Bengal as well, where the ruling CPM is already battling the Opposition over land acquisition for a Tata car unit in Singur. As the Left takes to the streets in Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra vowing to thwart what CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechuri calls sinister designs to push farmers from fertile farmland essentially for real estate, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government in Bengal has had eight more SEZs approved this week. 

 This is in addition to the seven zones okayed by the Union commerce ministry earlier, Bengal commerce and industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen says. These 15 SEZs have been approved in principle, which means plots to set the SEZs up have yet to be acquired. Five other SEZs have, however, already received formal approval from the commerce ministry and plots for these have been acquired. 

 Among the SEZs which received the Centres nod this week were the Indonesia-based Salim Groups proposed 10,000-acre multi-project zone at Nandigram in West Midnapore and a 12,500-acre zone in Haldia, Sen says. Videocon will set up two multi-project SEZs in Kharagpur and in North 24 Parganas, each measuring 2,500 acres. 

 But acquiring swathes of land for the SEZs is not going to be an easy task as the recent protests in Singur demonstrate. For the first time, the anti-SEZ movement has got people from all hues together, irrespective of their political affiliation, says Jayant Patil, member of the Peasants and Workers Party, who has been mobilising support for the anti-SEZ movement in Maharashtra. Actually the feeling and pain of losing your land and a way of life is so genuine that no single political party dare hijack the issue, Patil says. 

 Efforts are on to find a via media. Yechury says that, in a bid to save farmers from being displaced, his party has asked the Centre to use fallow land for its SEZs. And where acquisition of multi-cropped land is inevitable, farmers should be provided with adequate compensation and jobs, he says. 

 Concern for farmers is deep and wide. Some experts feel SEZs will create more problems for the country than solve them. There will be no social gains, only private gains of some individuals and industrialists, says Rajasthan-based social activist Aruna Roy. Others agree. Prof R. Vaidyanathan of the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, says the purpose of the SEZs is being defeated, for its increasingly becoming synonymous with insidious land grabbing. 

 Leaders such as Jayant Patil and Vivek Patil, an MLA from Navi Mumbai, vow to fight to the end as they carry on their agitation against displacement for Reliance Industries proposed SEZ in Maharashtra. Imagine being uprooted from your ancestral land and having no place to call your own, says Vivek Patil. This is our land and our identity. Even if they offer a fat compensation, we will not leave this place, he stresses. Reliance Industries did not reply to questions mailed to its spokesman about its SEZ plans and the agitation, despite repeated requests. 

 The emotive issue of land, however, is one of the sidelights of the controversy. At its very core are the not inconsiderable tax concessions being held out to the prospective SEZ developers and investors, something an International Monetary Fund (IMF) economist castigated as perverse economic incentives. The finance ministry fears losing as much as Rs 100,000 crore in tax revenues in four years as the 2005 SEZ Act allows companies a 10-year tax holiday on all incomes among a host of other benefits, and the tax breaks could divert existing or planned investment to SEZs. 

 Many fear that companies operating outside the SEZs will become non-competitive and several might shut as a result. What crime have these units outside the SEZs committed other than paying all sorts of taxes regularly, asks industrialist Rahul Bajaj. The chairman of Bajaj Auto Ltd feels the incentives being provided to the SEZ units are disproportionate to the incremental benefits that might accrue to the nation. 

 But for all the anti-SEZ tirades, can India, operating in an increasingly globalised economy, really afford to do without SEZs, a permanent fixture in several growing economies? Not really, say those who are on the other side of the debate. 

SEZs are known to have transformed China ( see 

box below ) and even Middle Eastern countries such as the United Arab Emirates. 

We need them no doubt about it to build world-class infrastructure, 

if nothing else, says economist Omkar Goswami, founder of the Corporate 

and Economic Research Group. 

 Countering the finance ministrys claim that the country would suffer huge revenue losses on account of SEZs, Union commerce minister Kamal Nath says India would actually earn an additional revenue of Rs 44,000 crore with SEZs serving as a catalyst for the increased economic activity. He argues that the tax sops, which already exist for exports, need to be extended to build infrastructure. The commerce ministry hopes to draw in an investment of Rs 1,00,000 crore, including a $5-billion foreign direct investment by 2007 end, if all goes well. 

 In fact, for state governments trying to outshine one another in terms of investment, the draw of an SEZ is irresistible, irrespective of the colour of the party in power in a state. After all, an SEZ is a magnet for investments. So, in a way, the mad rush for SEZs as Rahul Bajaj describes it is inevitable as the Reds in Bengal have the same political compulsion as the Saffrons in Gujarat to create more jobs and raise revenues. 

 No wonder, then, that the commerce ministry has already cleared 309 SEZs, of which 181 got formal and 128 in-principle approvals, Union commerce and industries secretary Gopal K. Pillai says. From Mukesh Ambanis Reliance to the Tatas and the Baba Kalyani group to the Mahindra group, they are all in the fray and looking for land. 

 But as the trickle turns into a tide, economists warn that the plethora of SEZs could turn out to be a classic case of too many, too soon. We need SEZs, but not so many. You cant have the country teeming with small SEZs, says economist Goswami. He says five things scale, location, deep pockets of the developers, political support and finally the developers ability to attract units are important for an SEZ to succeed. 

 According to Goswami, the successful SEZs overseas, especially those in China, are typically 10,000 hectares. By contrast, the commerce ministry has set a paltry 1,000-hectare (or even less in product-specific SEZs) minimum requirement for a multi-project SEZ. Locations are also crucial. You cant have SEZs in Bastar or Chhindwara and expect them to succeed. These must be near major ports and airports, Goswami says. 

 The agitating Left do not look at the issue the same way, though. CPM Rajya Sabha MP Nilotpal Basu accuses the Union government of covertly promoting real estate and construction in the name of manufacturing. Only 25 per cent of an SEZ area has been set aside for industrial use under the Act. Another 25 per cent has been earmarked for related social infrastructure (read: schools and hospitals). The Act is not clear on what can be done with the remaining 50 per cent of the land, but its widely assumed that the promoters can do with the land as they wish, raising fears that theyll cash in on the real estate by hawking it to developers. They should raise it to 50 per cent if they are serious about the industrial or manufacturing activities they are publicly swearing by in the SEZs, Basu says. 

 Other Left leaders agree. CPI general secretary Gurudas Dasgupta says the SEZs will aggravate the regional developmental imbalances existing in the country as they are not going to set up SEZs in Sikkimor in north Bihar or in Chhatisgarh. SEZs will end up creating a few islands of affluence in an ocean of poverty, Dasgupta holds. 

 Legal experts also find some parts of the SEZ Act worrying. It frees the SEZs from environmental clearances, mandatory for other industrial projects in the country. And the contentious Section 49 of the Act empowers the Centre to exempt any SEZ from operation of any existing law in the country. This is patently unconstitutional as its a legislative power that cannot be delegated to the government, Supreme Court lawyer Prashant Bhushan says. 

 The commerce ministry, meanwhile, is making an extra effort to allay fears. Commerce secretary G.K. Pillai stresses that no real estate activities other than building the required infrastructure will be allowed at the SEZs. Infrastructure development is related to the industrial units (being set up in an SEZ) and that can be done in stages, Pillai says. In any case, he adds, under the Act, no land can be sold in an SEZ area. So how can a builder or a developer sell land? 

 Pillai says the country needs world class infrastructure and hence SEZs. He is not alone in holding that belief. We certainly need SEZs to create more jobs, raise revenue and accelerate our economy. How else are we going to do this, asks Chandra Kumar Dhanuka, chairman of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce amp; Industrys eastern region council. 

Throwing the baby out with the bathwater may not be 

a good idea. But the challenge lies in separating the baby warts and all from 

the bathwater. 

The Chinese role model

China has five special economic zones (SEZ) 

and theyre today the role models for India. 

Chinas SEZs are in the forefront of its export-led growth, accounting for 

nearly 12 per cent of the countrys gross domestic product. Shenzhen (see 

pic) is the jewel in the crown. Its per capita income has ballooned more than 

20-fold since the SEZ was set up two-and-a-half decades ago. 

In 1980, nearly two years after China decided to experiment with a form of economic 

development other than communism, it set up three SEZs in Shenzhen, Zhuhai 

and Shantouto. Four more SEZs followed, including one in Xiamen in Fujian province 

and one in Hainan. In fact, in a path-breaking move, China turned the entire island 

province of Hainan into an SEZ. 

The country subsequently set up 15 free trade zones, 32-state level economic and 

technology development zones and 53 high-tech industrial zones in different cities. 

Yet, there is a marked difference between the Chinese and Indian SEZs. Chinese 

SEZs were initially set up by the government. But in our case, private players 

are being involved as our government is broke, says economist Omkar Goswami.

What the ruckus is about 

Point 

Counterpoint

Political parties and others 

fear that thousands of farmers will be displaced as companies scramble for vast 

tracts of land to set up SEZs. 

SEZs are known to have transformed 

China and are required because India needs jobs and world-class infrastructure. 

The substantial tax concessions 

for SEZ developers could lead to a loss of government revenue. The finance ministry 

fears losing as much as Rs 1,75,000 crore in tax revenues in four years. The tax 

breaks could divert existing or planned investment to SEZs. 

Revenue wont be lost. 

India would actually earn additional revenue of Rs 44,000 crore with SEZs serving 

as a catalyst for the increased economic activity, says Union commerce minister 

Kamal Nath. The tax sops already exist for exports and need to be extended to 

build infrastructure. 

SEZ promoters could hawk land 

to real estate developers and make a killing. 

Commerce secretary G.K. Pillai 

says that under the SEZ Act no land can be sold in an SEZ area. So how can a builder 

or a developer sell land?

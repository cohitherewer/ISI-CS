 Death pact

 Sir ? It would be most unfortunate if India signs the bilateral agreement with the US that would restrict its freedom to carry out nuclear tests, and thereby jeopardize its security interests (?Pact with US to close weapon door?, April 17). America is known for its hypocrisy, which is why it thinks nothing of stockpiling weapons while compelling other nations to forsake their nuclear freedom. As the president of India has pointed out, India should look for alternatives to uranium, which lies at the heart of the problem. India has rich deposits of thorium and the government should explore the possibilities of using its own resources instead of being dependent on other countries. 

 Manmohan Singh will be doing the nation a disservice if he signs the agreement that will compromise India?s position and sovereignty. The prime minister should come clean on the nuclear deal and reveal what exactly his government plans to do with the US on nuclear matters. 

 Yours faithfully,

R.B. Easwaran, Chennai

 Sir ? Hopefully, those who had gone over the moon about the proposed Indo-US nuclear deal now realize the hard realities. It was a foregone conclusion that the United States of America would try to wrest as many conditions as possible from a powerful south Asian nation in lieu of its munificence. By including the clause on nuclear testing in the 123 agreement, the US has effectively made India surrender its foreground. If India agrees to the deal, and if a regional nuclear conflict takes place a few years from now, India would find itself unable to retaliate. 

 This is only the first step towards handing over nuclear sovereignty. The next demand could be placing our fast breeder reactors under US scrutiny and safeguards on grounds that the plutonium from the reactors can be used for the manufacture of nuclear weapons. There could be further demands to scrap the civil-military separation and to place the Indian defence force under scrutiny. If these come into play as further amendments to the nuclear agreement with the US, India would be in no position to oppose them. Also, the proposed Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline would not exist after the deal is implemented. The US has tried without success to engage India in its misadventure in Iraq. It may succeed in drawing India in if the nuclear deal is through. 

 Yours faithfully,

Amit Banerjee, Calcutta 

 Sir ? The Indian government?s secret deals with the US concerning the signing of the comprehensive test ban treaty through the backdoor is appalling. The bilateral agreement, if sealed, would be death for India?s defence system. It would push India back to its previously weak position in Asia. The US is a fairweather friend and one India can do without. It would be better to collaborate with Russia, which is a time-tested ally, on nuclear issues.

 Yours faithfully,

Pinaki Roy, Balurghat

 Sir ? The US has always been envious of India?s nuclear potential, which is why the Bush administration is now intent on killing its nuclear programme once and forever. And the Manmohan Singh government seems as eager to fulfil its wish. There should be a referendum on the matter. Any haste in the matter is likely to prove suicidal.

 Yours faithfully,

Somesh Mahanty, Calcutta

 Uncorrected proof

 Sir ? The editorial, ?Right sum? (April 18), exposes the hollowness of the West Bengal state government?s claim of having made monumental progress in education. The ?outrageous errors? which Parthasarathi Mukhopadhayay found in a mathematics textbook of class VI, must have been noticed by teachers of government-aided schools. And yet they did not ask for the necessary corrections. Was it out of fear of displeasing their superiors?

 The incident exposes the callousness that has now become symptomatic of the functioning of the state education department. This complacency is the result of the left?s prolonged stay in power. If the government has any concern for students? welfare, it should withdraw the book and felicitate Mukhopadhayay in appreciation of his efforts.

 Yours faithfully,

Asit Kumar Mitra, Calcutta

 Sir ? In a state where court orders are repeatedly flouted by self-important education personnel who refuse pay and pension to teachers at whim, the chief minister?s lone crusade against an uncorrected textbook will run out of steam in no time. The book may be withdrawn, but there is no guarantee that it will be replaced by another one free of errors. Perhaps a committee needs to be set up to spot errors in texts and carry out the necessary corrections. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Mitra, Calcutta

 SECURE THE GAINS

 P.K. Vasudeva

 The recent visit of the director-general of the World Trade Organization, Pascal Lamy, to New Delhi was a concerted effort to make India concede ground in industrial tariff negotiations. The burden of his message was that India, which had gained from international trade under the WTO auspices, would stand to lose if concessions are not made and the ongoing Doha round of multilateral trade negotiations was not concluded successfully.

 On the agriculture front, export subsidies are supposed to be eliminated by 2013. But this will be of little benefit to developing countries. First, most developing countries wanted 2010 and not 2013 as the end date. Second, the European Union is already committed to removing all export subsidies by 2013 under its common agricultural policy reform programme. 

 Most important, the export subsidies constitute a minuscule proportion of the overall quantum of trade-distorting subsidies in the developed countries. The ministerial declaration is silent on the issues of domestic subsidies and market success because the developed countries had already gained substantially on the issue during the framework agreement of July 2004. 

 Trade war

 Lamy believes that on the issue of domestic farm support and agriculture tariffs, India has scored impressive gains in the negotiations. Further, the gradual opening up of the Indian economy to foreign manufacturers through a carefully calibrated lowering of customs duties has sent a strong message to the world that concessions are being made to the interests of the country?s trading partners. What Lamy would like India to do is ?try to trade these self-serving reductions against concessions in this or other areas in the WTO.? 

 Reduction in tariff rates of industrial products has been one of the objectives of the multilateral trading regime. However, this has to be done in a manner that is consistent with the developmental objectives of the WTO member countries. The negotiations on the non-agriculture market access are based on the Doha mandate of 2001 that calls for reduction in or elimination of tariff peaks, tariff escalation, high tariffs and non-tariff barriers, especially for products of export interest to developing countries. It also calls for comprehensive product coverage and less than full reciprocity in reduction commitments for developing countries. The NAMA negotiations have been tortuous and many developing countries have expressed concern.

 Major concerns

 India has expressed two major developmental concerns in NAMA negotiations. First, developed countries must reduce or eliminate high tariffs on products of export interest to developing countries. Second, developing countries should have the necessary policy space to use industrial tariffs to pursue industrialization.

 Of the most contentious issues related to NAMA is tariff-reduction modalities. The declaration states that a Swiss formula with coefficients shall be adopted. This means that the EU proposal for a Swiss formula with a single coefficient for both the developed and the developing countries has been abandoned. 

 Washington and Brussels would like India and Brazil to reduce their bound rates on industrial import tariffs by around half for the agriculture-related concessions they have reportedly offered. India feels that if it accepts the demands, it would constrict its ability to protect domestic industrial interests. India has argued that the demand is not consistent with the overall ?development? orientation of the Doha round. And yet, as Lamy has rightly emphasized, it would not be in India?s interests to threaten the very existence of the WTO by its perceived intransigence. Clearly, judicious flexibility is the need of the hour.

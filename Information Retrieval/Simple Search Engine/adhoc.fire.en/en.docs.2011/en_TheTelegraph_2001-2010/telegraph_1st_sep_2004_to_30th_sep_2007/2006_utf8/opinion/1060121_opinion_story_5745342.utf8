The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 UNIVERSITY OF MEDIOCRITY

 One hundred and fifty years is not exactly a mosaic jubilee in the life of a university. There are universities in Europe which are many hundred years older than the University of Calcutta. Yet the beginning of the 150th year of Calcutta University is a landmark because it was one of the premier institutions of higher learning in India. The verb ?was? is used advisedly and with emphasis. When the government of the English East India Company decided to establish universities in Calcutta, Bombay and Madras, the purpose was not to promote excellence in the pursuit of knowledge. The immediate aim was more limited and practical. The British Indian administration needed educated natives to man the lower rungs of government. But by the end of the 19th century, the University of Calcutta had transcended this original aim and had begun to aspire to the content of its own motto, ?Advancement of Learning?. This was largely the work of men like Ashutosh Mookerjea, who fought to establish the autonomy of the university and began to attract genuine intellectual talent to teach and conduct research there. Thus came Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and C.V. Raman from south India. Thus was produced, entirely homespun, scientists of the calibre of J.C. Bose, S.N. Bose and Meghnad Saha, and economists of the sophistication of Mr Amartya Sen and Sukhamoy Chakraborty. 

 It is a sorry but undeniable fact that in the last fifty years, Calcutta University has not produced a single figure in any field whose achievements can even be put on the same table as those who have been mentioned. Instead, what the university has produced is thousands of graduates every year. Quantity has replaced quality. Mediocrity has surpassed talent.

 The reasons for this remarkable decline are not difficult to identify. The decline follows from wrongheaded policies and priorities. Over the years, those who have run the university have refused to accept that standards of excellence in education cannot be maintained if the university is made into a degree-awarding machine. Calcutta University has refused to decentralize its mode of examination and its syllabus-setting. As a result, product has suffered and the motto of the university has been reduced to a mockery of itself. This process has been aided and abetted by the increasing politicization of the university at every level. Calcutta University ? its policies, its appointments and its patronage ? is run on remote from Alimuddin Street. Over the university administration falls the shadow, like that of rahu on the moon, of the ruling political party.

 The anniversary celebrations should provide an occasion for introspection. What does Calcutta University want of itself? Does it want to reclaim its lost status or is it happy doling out devalued degrees? Is it happy being run by party commissars or does it want to fulfil the promise contained in the three words, ?Advancement of Learning??

 WHEN MENON MEETS RIAZ

 The new alignment in the South Block could have a positive fallout in the Indo-Pak foreign secretary-level talks, writes Jyoti Malhotra

 All will be well: Pranab Mukherjee with Shiv Shanker Menon

 Minutes after Pranab Mukherjee took over as the new minister for external affairs from defence a couple of weeks or so ago, the army, navy and air force chiefs walked into his office to formally say goodbye and hello. 

 Sir, you didnt even tell us you were going, they chorused in unison. Mukherjee seemed pleased as punch at the genuine affection these grown men were displaying. Clearly, in those two years in that other corner of South Block, these men had come to have a lot of things in common. 

 Since then, the stream of guests to Mukherjees office has hardly slowed down. You could argue that this is where they are all supposed to come anyway, especially those from overseas. But along with all the ambassadors whom Mukherjee has been hosting at lunch these past few days at the Hyderabad House and all of them are pleased as punch at the attention they have received, a far cry from all the iconoclastic admonition of his predecessor, K. Natwar Singh there is another, unusual visitor who has been walking the other stretch, back into South Block from the prime ministers office. 

 His name is M.K. Narayanan, and he is the national security advisor. Nothing wrong with Indians meeting Indians, the still-new foreign secretary, Shiv Shanker Menon, once said when he was asked about his unusual journey to A.K. Gopalan Bhavan to meet Communist Party of India (Marxist) leaders, Sitaram Yechury and Prakash Karat. 

 Clearly, you could apply the same yardstick to Narayanan and Mukherjee. The only difference is that Narayanan never came to meet Natwar Singh in South Block, preferring to exercise power in his corner in the PMO. Clearly, too, there is the realization that the latest incumbent at Gate Number 4 is the centre of the circle, the new point of order, defining the latest shift in the balance of power. 

 This new realignment will find reflection this month as India and Pakistans foreign secretaries meet on November 14-15, and the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, visits in the third week. Interestingly, at a time when both relationships are delicately balanced, Shiv Shanker Menon, a fluent Mandarin speaker and recently returned after three years in Islamabad, is especially poised to deal with both. 

 Watch, then, the shift in New Delhi-speak these last few days : Only a couple of weeks ago, the whole nation was astir with Narayanans remarks over credible, but not clinching evidence from the Mumbai bomb blasts. The hand of the Inter-Services Intelligence was clearly manifest, Narayanan added, but this would hardly stand in a court of law. 

 But last week, as the cabinet committee on security cleared the governments strategy on talks with Pakistan, official sources stressed that they were not going to jab an accusing finger in the eye of Pakistans foreign secretary, Riaz Mohammed Khan, telling him that it was the ISI or Rawalpindi or freelance terrorists who were at the bottom of the Indian terrorism mess. 

 Instead, Shiv Shanker Menon would nicely explain to his counterpart, Riaz Mohammed Khan, that India could hardly continue a peace process with Pakistan, if completely innocent people in India continued to die from terrorism which had its links in Pakistan. 

 The sources pointed out that India would place the evidence before the Pakistanis, evidence from Mumbai and Malegaon and Bangalore and Nagpur and Mysore. They would disarmingly admit that even as the chargesheet from Mumbai had not been placed before a court, there were certain lines of investigation that the Pakistani authorities could follow back home, on their own side.

 Meaning, if the peace process needed to be sustained, Pakistan would be put to test, as it were, to show commitment to peace. Whether it was the ISI, or freelance agents of terror or insubordinate officers in Rawalpindi giving the go-ahead to their boys, it hardly mattered to Delhi. What, after all, was there in a name, especially if it was in Punjabi? No, no, all New Delhi wanted to see were results.

 Siachen and Sir Creek could follow, very nicely. The point was not whether the newly-installed defence minister, A.K. Antony, had seen through his army/air forces barely concealed designs by taking journalists upto the Siachen base camp (the second time in six months, the last time being before the defence secretary-level talks between India and Pakistan) this weekend, so that these journalists would write glowing accounts of the truly remarkable courage that Indian soldiers had often shown much beyond the call of duty.

 The point was whether Pakistan was willing to bring the terrorism down to a low enough level, one that India could live with. If it was, anything was on the cards, perhaps even a visit by the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, to Pakistan, with agreements on Siachen and Sir Creek to bring up the other end of the fireworks.

 Certainly, Pranab Mukherjee and M.K. Narayanan are said to be united on this one and will fight this round together. The deep distress levels caused by terrorism are enough for the politician and the intelligence official to hold hands and speak in one voice.

 As for Shiv Shanker Menon, remember that as Indias ambassador to Beijing in 2003, he had persuaded the Chinese to pull off a deal on the border with then prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, by arguing in favour of an off-camera negotiation between two special representatives. Jaw-jaw, instead of war-war, was Menons formula then.

 It is a formula he is likely to re-employ with Pakistan, via the counter-terrorism mechanism set up in Havana between Manmohan Singh and Pervez Musharraf. That could, indeed, become the deal-sealer when Menon meets Riaz today.

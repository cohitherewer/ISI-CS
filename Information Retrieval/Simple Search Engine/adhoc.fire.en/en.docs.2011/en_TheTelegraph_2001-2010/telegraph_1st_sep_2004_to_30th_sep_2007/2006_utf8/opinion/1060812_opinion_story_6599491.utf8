The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 WHERE FROM HEATHROW?

 Condemnation and congratulations are both in order. The former for the dastardly attempt to kill innocent people through a series of synchronized bomb blasts on a number of aircraft making the Atlantic crossing. The latter to Scotland Yard and MI5 for tracking down this plot and acting swiftly to arrest the conspirators and potential murderers. Even though the details are still unknown, it is clear that it was a police and intelligence operation on a gigantic scale which prevented what the British home secretary, Mr John Reid, rightly described as a plot to perpetrate mass murder. The hardships that passengers at the Heathrow Airport are having to suffer are really a very small price to pay for the disaster that was averted and whose shadow, as intelligence agencies continue to point out, has in no way receded. The attempt to strike terror by killing ordinary people can move to other shores and threaten the security of other nations, including India.

 The scale of the plot and the sophisticated technology that was used for it belie the theory that the battle against terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism is a battle between the forces of enlightenment and obscurantism. Religious fundamentalism, wherever it has turned violent and taken to terrorism, as in the case of al Qaida and other militant outfits, has used modern techniques in explosives, in mobilizing finances and ideological propaganda. The terrorism that threatens the globe today is as much a product of globalization as the benefits of the free market. Terrorism and globalization are different facets of what is recognized as the modern.

 There is another crucial aspect of the modern that needs to be remembered in this context. The modern world, with all its inequalities and problems as well as its many undeniable achievements, is emphatically the product of the domination that Europe and the United States of America established over the rest of the world. This was a dominance based on military and economic power, which spread to spheres of knowledge. The Occident, one could say simplifying the complex arguments of Edward Said, produced the Orient. The Western powers carved up the rest of the world, created nations where none existed, fomented factions and even armed religious fundamentalists. All this was underpinned by economic exploitation and political oppression. It was inevitable that people would begin to resist this domination and decide to eliminate oppression and injustice through violence. The roots of terrorism lie here. The West is now fighting forces that are its own creations. Violence had bred violence.

 The process continues and the doctrine of the clash of civlizations is poised to become a self-fulfilling prophecy. One attempt at mass murder has been foiled; but that does not mean other similar plots will not be executed. And what about genocide carried out in the name of civilization and enlightenment?

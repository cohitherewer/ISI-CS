 NEW AGE PUBLISHING

 Naipaul: rejected

 Publishers and literary agents have always claimed that they know best how to assess the literary quality of a novel and whether it would sell. That publishers have made huge blunders is an old story but a recent undercover investigation by The Sunday Times revealed a shocking deterioration in literary standards and a total insensitivity to language, style and subject. The newspaper carried out a sting, sending the opening chapters of two Booker Prize-winning novels to 20 London agents and publishers: Stanley Middleton?s Holiday (he shared the Booker with Nadine Gordimer in 1974) and V.S. Naipaul?s In a Free State (1971). Many did not reply at all, and the ones who did mostly rejected both. Nobody recognized the authors. 

 What?s going on? Look at it from two points of view: the publisher?s and the author?s. Have publishers become so callous as not to be able to recognize good writing any more? Can the quality of the work alone help the author? Or are extra-literary considerations also factored in by publishers? There is absolutely no doubt that literary abilities of editors have declined in the last few decades. There are several reasons for this, but one of the most important is the fact that book publishers don?t offer as attractive a package as the media do. When it comes to choosing a career that satisfies some literary interests the media offers much better prospects.

 But that?s just part of the story. Good editors are not born; they grow over time through regular intellectual inputs across a range of subjects. What happens with many editors who had the proper background to begin with is that they flag off after a few years and fall into a rut which deadens whatever literary sensitivities they might have had. 

 Of course, this is an occupational hazard but it becomes worse in publishing houses that are simply drowning in unsolicited manuscripts ? 10 to 15 a day. Given the pressures of daily work, no editor goes beyond a few chapters, at best; some not even that. Often it isn?t necessary either because a few pages are enough to give an idea of language and style. But it isn?t just a lack of critical sense or the daily pressures that explains why mediocre works get published and the better dumped into slush piles. The greatest pressures come from the changing nature of the market. In recent years, age, gender and the ?looks? of an author have become important factors. While a beautiful face may no longer be a perquisite for a career in films, publishers are becoming obsessed with whether a prospective writer is young and glamourous enough to attract readers as, don?t forget in the initial marketing push, many authors are directly involved in sales promotion through bookshop visits, talk shows and so on. 

 Clearly a ?new? school of publishing has begun to emerge. It believes that in an age of competing forms of mass entertainment, a book does not sell on its literary merit alone but rides on the back of a whole lot of extra-literary factors, the most important of which is the ?marketing? potential of the writer?s personality. What Rupert Murdoch has done for the mass media by making it a part of the entertainment industry is now being extended to the book world. So don?t be surprised if there is a rash of books by B-list celebrities while serious authors struggle to find acceptance.

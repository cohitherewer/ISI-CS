 VALUE TO RURAL MARKETS

Alok K. Chattopadhyay

 When the regulation regime came into effect, the Agriculture Produce Market Committees in India geared up to the change. West Bengal, with its rich manpower, can easily lead the way in rural development enterprises, provided there is a political will to implement.

 Visits to several southern and northern states to study APMCs and regulated market committees revealed that the problems were diverse and state-specific, making homogeneous solutions impossible. Yet, flexibility was needed, as we could not compromise anymore on development. The interests of small growers and consumers were of paramount importance. Infrastructure and better communication were necessary, but so was human development.

 Therefore, by resource development, we emphasize on enterprise generation among those below the poverty line, with a view to achieve decentralized planning. The regulated market committees could play a pivotal role in generating enterprise, as well as in prompting an interface between academics and bureaucrats, particularly at the state board level. It may be assumed here that enterprise, and not capital, is the main constraint on economic development. In any case, rural development does not require huge capital expenditure and its opportunity costs are a small sacrifice of some urban facilities. Hence a built-in deficit-free system may be proposed. 

 Held to ransom

 Enterprise is lacking at the level of planners, bureaucrats and academics more than at the level of farmers. Bureaucrats need to undergo rural training to learn what the villagers already know. Yet they pull strings against the latter?s developmental activities. Thus, it is their inaction which holds the rural sector to ransom.

 West Bengal, with its huge base of small farmers in Burdwan, Hooghly and the 24 Parganas, has held a dominating position in Indian agriculture. Farming and plantations simultaneously existed in North Bengal. Though a major activity, farming has been inadequate as a means of livelihood and constrained by shortage of land. So the farms had to expand their scope, incorporating other enterprises, particularly during the off-seasons. 

 In this age of privatization, globalization and liberalization, no external agencies, including government ones, should be banked upon for direct employment generation. Individuals and groups have to prepare themselves, with government support and security, for enterprises of their own. 

 Next move

 While the authorities cannot ensure jobs, they can secure and insure enterprises. A culture of cooperation in securing credit for business, production and marketing needs to be developed. As individuals come forward to form cooperatives, the RMCs have a role to play in detecting such enterprises and promoting them. 

 Enterprise should also be culled by social science students of nearby colleges. Periodic visits to villages could help in following up the progress of projects and note down reasons behind possible lags. This would be useful in subsequent deliberations. Some collaboration with private enterprises and NGOs working in the villages should not be ruled out. The Vivekananda Path Chakra of Ghatmura village in West Midnapore has been catering to the education, health and enterprise generation of villagers since 1982 in an area where Maoists held sway. 

 The West Bengal government?s move to constitute a committee, with representation from even academic circles, has reached as far as Mysore. It has been found that a work appraisal of the APMCs is yet to be undertaken in India. So Bengal is a pioneer of sorts. The first move made, it is now time to finish the task.

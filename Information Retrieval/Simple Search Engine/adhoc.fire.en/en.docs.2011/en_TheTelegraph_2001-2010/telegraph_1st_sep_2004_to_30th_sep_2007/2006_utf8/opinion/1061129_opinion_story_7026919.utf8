 THE DEMONS AND THE CHERUBS

 Not enough has been done in India to either prevent child sexual abuse or protect its victims, argues Srirupa Ray

 Soft targets

 November 19 was World Day for the Prevention of Child Abuse. And in India, where celebrations of any kind are rarely missed, the day was duly observed. But what constructive measures have been taken to prevent child abuse (now a much more recognizable term)? 

 Last year, parliament passed the Offences Against Children Act 2005, which looked like an ambitious venture. India, finally, appeared to have woken up to the need for a comprehensive legislation to deal with crimes perpetrated against children. Yet, the lawmakers fail to show enough sensitivity to the issue or give children a voice or accord them basic dignity. 

 The new act proposes to protect children from all forms of sexual abuse, neglect, exploitation, torture, or any form of cruelty. In fact, the first clause in the statement of objects of this legislation is To identify offences against children and protect children from offences. But how are the offences to be identified? More important, who is to identify them the state or the children themselves? Are children in India equipped with the tools to discern the subtle line between expressions of affection and sexual offence? 

 India is a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, and it had the document ratified in 1992. But it took 13 years for the government to formulate a law in which sexual offences are brought to the fore. It took India 13 years to acknowledge that such crimes happen in reality. But legislation alone and a superficial one at that is not going to cut down the rates of sexual offences against children. It is also not going to encourage more people to report these offences. 

 In our society, children are hardly ever allowed to have any consciousness of their own bodies and sexuality. First, the child is treated as an asexual being, invested with the neuter gender, and therefore rendered powerless, devoid of sexual agency or consciousness. Second, the adult, respectable society in India has such deeply entrenched notions of sexual morality that most sexually-abused children think it is their fault if someone abuses them. If they are not comfortable with the behaviour of the adult, they are too guilt-ridden to talk about what has happened to them with any objectivity. Even if a child musters enough courage to report sexual abuse, what credibility will such allegations hold? In India, especially, such cases involve so much shame and self-persecution that the very thought of relating the incident to anybody will discourage the child from opening up. Children are more vulnerable to subjugation and manipulation than adults. How will the authorities stop a child from being intimidated? 

 The rampant child sex tourism in the country is now an important concern for India. After Goa, the beaches of Orissa are the new hotspot for paedophiles. Pentakota, a fishing village near Puri II, has massage parlours by the score, offering a variety of sexual services by nubile fingers that provide 100 per cent satisfaction. The police and the state authorities are either blissfully ignorant about this or are deliberately silent. In March 2006, two foreigners, Duncan Grant and Allan Waters, who had opened a shelter home for children in Colaba, were convicted of paedophilia and imprisoned for six years. Keeping in mind the number of foreign tourists frequenting the beaches of Goa and the wayside motels that supply children to these men, the government of Goa had formulated the Goa Childrens Act in 2003. This act seeks to protect all children, whether juveniles in conflict with the law, children of commercial sex workers, or even a foetus. But the Offences Against Children Act, in spite of taking into its ambit children of women in prostitution, is restricted to any premises other than a brothel in cases of commercial sexual exploitation. How does this law define a brothel? Are these only places where adult prostitutes function or do they also include the massage parlours mentioned above, where children provide services to middle-aged men? Most sex workers children, especially girls, are forced into prostitution at a tender age. About 30 per cent of all prostitutes in India are children. Is that not child abuse? The new act seems to leave the impression that prostitution by minors children of adult prostitutes who stay with them in the brothels, does not fall within its purview. Perhaps a clearer perspective would have helped. 

 Child sexual abuse in our country carry more stigma than rape of adults. That is one major reason why such cases hardly ever reach the courts. The ones that do, have the child facing more trauma. As a Voluntary Health Association of India report noted, a sexually abused child suffers four times at the time of the offence, while narrating the incident, during a medical examination and, finally, when the child has to face the courts . The psychological impact the trial has on the child often forces parents or guardians to withdraw the charges. The family is also deemed a non-interfereable unit, which affects many court decisions. The need to preserve the family honour often prompts adults to suppress cases of incest. The preconceived notion is that a child can never be harmed by those close to him. Unless such ideas are erased, all children abused by their relations will not be able to protest against the injustice.

 The physical injury and the deep mental scars left by sexual abuse make it very difficult for the child to recover from such an experience. Counselling helps the child come to terms with what has happened. Psychiatric advice is also a must for the abuser. This alone could assure that he mends his ways. But according to the child abuse legislation, the court may provide for the counselling of abused children, excepting in cases of sexual violence...and trafficking. One can well see how half-hearted the attempt to provide counselling here is.

 Article 19 of the UNCRC mentions, States Parties shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violenceincluding sexual abuse. Such protective measures should include effective procedures for the establishment of social programmes to provide necessary support for the child Legislative measures have at least begun to shape up in India, though belatedly, and in a very rudimentary form. But awareness is yet to be spread through social and educational means. The Central Board of Secondary Education has planned to introduce a sex education course called the adolescence and reproductive sexual health programme, which will deal with physical changes related to puberty, interest in the opposite sex, sexually transmitted diseases and the myths involving AIDS. It is also supposed to deal with substance abuse, mental aggression and depression, developing ones self-esteem and healthy food habits. This will be included in the curriculum of students of class VI and above. 

 Not surprisingly, the programme does not cover child abuse. Yet, right from the time a child is admitted to school, he or she should be made aware of safe and unsafe touches the key way to spot cases of sexual abuse. How are educational institutions in the country alerting children about sexual violence? Clearly, making sex education mandatory in schools alone will not do. 

 The state and society have to remember that the key word to curb child abuse is prevention. And in order to prevent, sundry legislations here and there will not be able to achieve anything by way of solving the problem. The silence can only be broken if the society understands the gravity of the matter and makes a serious effort to check the crime. To do this, it is necessary to raise public awareness against such abuses through regular and relentless media campaigns and advertisements. The state has to find a way to address the issue without encroaching on the private lives of its citizens. Our children will witness a future very different from what we have conceived for them. The least we can do is allow them to enjoy their days of innocence without hindrance.

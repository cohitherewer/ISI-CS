 OLD FRIENDS

 The decision by the board of governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency to report Iran to the United Nations security council, for its non-compliance on the nuclear issue, was inevitable. India?s decision to support this is dictated by national interest, and that alone should be the basis for taking positions in international relations. A vast majority of the IAEA board voted for the resolution, including China and Russia, which have, in the past, sought to find accommodation with Tehran. Out of 35 member states on the board, 27 voted for reporting Iran, while only Cuba, Venezuela and Syria voted against the resolution. The decision does not, however, mean that Iran would immediately face economic sanctions or coercive action. The decision has provided a ?window of opportunity? for one month during which time diplomacy will once again be given a chance. Iran?s immediate reaction seems to have been belligerent. Mr Javed Vaeidi, deputy head of Iran?s powerful national security council, declared that the country would stop honouring facilities. He also claimed that Tehran would now resume uranium enrichment.

 The Indian decision has expectedly been criticized by the left. Critics have also suggested that it was American pressure that influenced India?s decision. They have been aided by the American ambassador?s recent remarks that the India-US nuclear deal could be jeopardized if New Delhi voted against the resolution. This is most unfortunate. It should be clear that the Indian position has been rooted in pragmatic considerations. There is sufficient evidence now to prove that Tehran is in breach of its obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Indeed, it is well known that the Pakistani nuclear scientist, Mr A.Q. Khan, was actively assisting Tehran with its nuclear weapons programme. The presence of another nuclear-weapon state in a deeply volatile region of the world would undermine regional and international stability. Moreover, New Delhi seemed to have worked behind the scenes to water down the resolution favoured by the US to ensure that diplomacy was given a chance for some time at least. The fact that both China and Russia voted for the resolution suggests that this is not a move dictated by American interests alone. While Tehran is an important ally, the relationship with the US is vital for furthering Indian interests.

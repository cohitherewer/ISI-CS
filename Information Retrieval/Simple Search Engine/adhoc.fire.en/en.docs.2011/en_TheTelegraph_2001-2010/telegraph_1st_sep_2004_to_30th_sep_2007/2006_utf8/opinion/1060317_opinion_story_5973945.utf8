 TRAIN OF TERROR

 Anarchists love the trappings of an ideology, even if it is an outdated one. The so-called Maoist rebellion in parts of India is a case in point. Its hit-and-run strategy often makes easy victims of policemen, politicians and even ordinary people. Raiding a train and taking its passengers prisoner for some hours, as the rebels have done in Jharkhand, is the latest show of their boldness. But all these do not sum up as what Mao Zedong called the ?revolutionary war?, which is ?a war of the masses? and ?can be waged only by mobilizing the masses?. It is another matter, though, that such wars have a history of degenerating into massacres of innocent people. But the only impact that the self-styled Maoists of India have on the masses is one of terror. In fact, the rebellion?s isolation from the people is better understood if one compares it with the Naxalite movement of the Sixties and the Seventies. That brief uprising not only evoked Mao?s name, but also had its appeal for a wide cross-section of the people in both urban and rural India. By contrast, the current Maoist upsurge is more of a revolt mainly by the tribal people, who are the poorest of the poor in India. This is borne out by the fact that the tribal people are in a majority in most of the 165 districts affected by the rebellion. It shows the dark underbelly of India?s brave new economy. 

 However, the rebellion exposes many failures of the state. Obviously, the fruits of political and economic freedoms have not reached large sections of the people. And the tribal people have suffered the worst deprivations. Not that these areas have not seen any economic development. But the tribal people and other sections of the poor have paid more for such development than they have gained from it. Also, the redresses they expect from the parliamentary system elude them. Their revolts have alarmed governments and politicians, but have rarely prompted them to take such action as could change things. The failure of the police and other law-enforcing agencies to combat the rebels is only one of the problems. The big problem is the state?s lack of will to meet the larger socio-economic challenges. Governments of the day routinely talk of tackling these issues. But the state?s response is rarely any better than tokenism. It is necessary to use force to defeat the rebels. But it is more important to change the way in which the other half of India lives.

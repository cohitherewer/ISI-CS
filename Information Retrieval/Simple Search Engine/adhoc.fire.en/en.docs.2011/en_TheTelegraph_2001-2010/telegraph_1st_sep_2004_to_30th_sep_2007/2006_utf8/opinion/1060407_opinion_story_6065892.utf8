 STRIKE AGAIN

 The indefinite strike by the State Bank of India employees needs to be settled without further delay. True, thanks to tie-ups with automated teller machines operated by other banks, SBI depositors are able to withdraw money from their accounts. But the strike has affected businessmen and corporates, while some government employees and pensioners have not had their salaries credited. The reason for the strike is straightforward ? SBI employees have not had any revision in their pensions since 1992, although there have been several wage agreements since then. Their pensions are linked to the salaries they received in 1992 and they say a revision is called for. On the other hand, the government says that it cannot accede to the bank?s demands because that would trigger similar demands from other banks too. They say that while SBI employees have the benefit of pension, contributory provident fund as well as gratuity, other bank employees do not have all three benefits.

 The finance minister is certainly right when he said that ?there is no justification at all to inconveniencing the people?, particularly when thousands of crores worth of business is being lost. At the same time, the unions have a point when they say that SBI is making massive profits and it can well afford to pay out higher pensions to its employees. It is unclear why the government should have to intervene. The SBI unions have said that the management has already agreed to their claim for a higher pension, but it is the finance ministry that has put its foot down. If so, the government has no business to do so. Surely it is up to the SBI board of directors to take a decision on the matter, if necessary bargaining for other concessions from their workers in return for the pension benefits? The finance ministry?s argument that other banks may also demand the benefit is also flawed. Every bank management should be allowed to take its own decision in the matter based on their ability to pay. The days of an industry-wide standard pay structure have long gone. It is well-known that the public sector banks suffer from their inability to match salaries paid by the new private sector and foreign banks. Many of their best employees are poached by the private sector. In the competitive environment that banks operate in at present, their inability to pay competitive salaries is a serious handicap. At the same time, there?s a strong case for rationalization of the workforce in the PSU banks. It is high time, therefore, that the government got off the backs of the managements of PSU banks, allowing them to frame modern personnel policies.

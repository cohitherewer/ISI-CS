 IN THE HEART OF THE COUNTRY

 SEEING THROUGH THE STONES: A TALE FROM THE MAOIST LAND 

 By Dipendra Raychaudhuri, 

 Vitasta, 

 Rs 300

 The poor having become pass in the mainstream creative discourse, the protagonist of this work, Mahendra Chamar, is almost a novelty. So is this unabashedly political story that unravels in lands that are almost extinct from the nations collective literary memory today.

 It all starts around tiny, non-descript hamlets in the heart of what bureaucratic parlance describes as the red corridor. The story moves in the past, present and the future of those who still believe that power flows through the barrel of the gun. Amid the cruelty of village life, the slow transformation of the son of the wretched Birju Chamar into a gun-totting ideologue could have been predictable. But there is just that hint of chill in the customary violence, almost routine in the way only a reporter can describe.

 Munni, Mahendras lover, of the tangy smells of manure and earth, follows his advice to resist being dragged into the fields every day and getting raped. She kicks the Chhote Thakur where it really hurts. Even the immediate upshot (at the back of the haveli, fifteen men took turns to rape her before they strangled her bleeding body) is not as chilling as the response of Munnis own people. Men in the Harijan-tola turn on the dead girl with uncharacteristic vengeance: She kicked the Thakur! What sin! Jaisan karni, aisan bharni (you reap what you sow), the women comment, though sadly.

 What spruces up the drudgery is the scathing critique of the Indian mainstream left that intermingles beautifully with the dominant strands of the story. The radicals are not spared either; but it is not hard to spot the kid-gloves in their treatment. Politics is the mainstay of Mahendra Chamars existence, even of its beauty and sensuality.The party decides who he should marry and guides him to the lush Budhni, the comrade with a red hibiscus in her hair and a bangle of flowers girdled at her wristsa short, shoddy sari that does not hide her body.

 And there are uplifting insights, that only a political correspondent could have been privy to. Out of the blue, the party asks Mahendra to marry Comrade Ramia. Even the revered comrade Babu, Mahendras mentor, has no explanation for this abrupt diktat. Mahendra discovers, by instinct, that he has to marry Ramia because she too is a Dalit like him. This revelation is enough to unmask the lofty world that he imagined the comrades inhabited till then. The story moves in circles from the heady days when the colour red was a fashion statement, to the loss of the gloss around the mid-Eighties, and the cynicism and absence of intellectual rigour that characterized the underground left at the end of the century.

 This book is not an ideological statement. Nor is it that soft-focus throwback to the halcyon days when the chattering class actually chatted about another world that was possible. What sets it apart is the exceptional blend of hard political scrutiny with a gripping tale, very simply told.

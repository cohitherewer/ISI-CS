 Letters to Editor

 Uses of power

 Sir Most predictions about India may have been proved false by history, as Ramachandra Guha insists in Truth be told (Nov 25), but Winston Churchills saying seems to stand the test of time. On the eve of Indias independence, he had said that power would ultimately slip into the hands of men of straw...rascals, rogues and freebooters. Guha may disagree, but India has been unable to give itself an efficient administration. In our government offices, even a father may have to bribe his son to get his pension.

 Yours faithfully,

 Asoke C. Banerjee, Calcutta

 False assumption

 Sir The article, Tata Steel game for a unit in Brazil (Nov 13), erroneously mentions that the company may consider a primary steel unit in Brazil.

 The news report is highly speculative and uses information in the public domain and quotations from my press conference in Calcutta recently and in the past while positioning it as if the correspondent has interviewed me personally. We have never indicated any particular country or company, especially Brazil, as acquisition targets. In fact, we, as well as our chairmans office, have specifically denied reports on possible acquisitions in Brazil and the denial is posted on the BSE website. This kind of article derived out of false assumptions is confusing to The Telegraphs readers and our stakeholders.

 Yours faithfully,

B. Muthuraman,

 Star trek

 Sir The behaviour of the bodyguards of Angelina Jolie in the Anjuman-E-Islam school of Mumbai is appaling (Insult boomerangs on Jolie minders, Nov 18). One of the guards accused in the case had also manhandled a photographer in Pune last month. These incidents are disturbing as they remind one of the fact that racial prejudices still exist, howsoever one may try to dismiss them as a thing of the past. How can Mahesh Jethmalani take up the case on behalf of the accused despite being an Indian? In a way, of course, he is proving himself to be his fathers son. If Ram Jethmalani can defend Manu Sharma, the prime accused in the Jessica Lal murder case, it is not surprising that his son should fight for Jolies despicable bodyguards. 

 Yours faithfully,

Jayantabishnu Mukherjee, Calcutta

 Sir Ever since Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie arrived in India, they have spelt trouble. And now, even while enjoying Indian hospitality, their bodyguards have the temerity to insult the people of this country. The men seem to be at pains to prove to their employers that they are worth every penny that is spent on them. And Jolie and Pitt do not seem to be averse to the publicity they are getting, thanks to their security guards. However, one cannot overlook the lapses on the Indian side too. How could the school authorities have given the film crew the consent to shoot within the premises when the school was in session and the producers had not taken police permission? 

 Yours faithfully,

Govind Das Dujari, 

 Calcutta 

 Sir Being ignored during the rides on Mumbais local trains must have made Brangelina feel neglected. The confusion at the Anjuman-E-Islam school must have gone a long way to keep their self-esteem intact. After the manhandling of a photographer in Pune, the bodyguards should have been instructed to be careful in their dealings with the local people. Since it is clear that no such action had been taken, Jolie and Pitt must be held responsible for the misdemeanour of their bodyguards. 

 Yours faithfully,

S. Kamat, Bardez, Goa

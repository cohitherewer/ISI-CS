 CURSE OF THE RED STAR

 Gwynne Dyer

 Arriving in Beijing on August 23 for his third China visit in five years, Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez, praised the countrys communist leaders to the skies for having rescued China from a practically feudal situation and made it into one of the worlds largest economies in less than half a century. It was a predictable remark by the firebrand Venezuelan leader. It was also entirely wrong.

 Back in the late Eighties, when mocking the few remaining communist believers had become a popular indoor sport in the former Soviet Union, one of my favourite gambits was to point out that Russia would have done far better economically if the communist revolution of 1917 had never happened at all. No matter how pessimistic your assumptions about the way that a non-communist Russia would have developed, it simply could not have done as badly as the communists did.

 To prove your point, all you had to do was to pick some other country that had been at about the same stage of industrial development as Russia just before World War II Italy was the most obvious candidate to compare the outcomes in the present.

 Italy went through the Great Depression in the Thirties and was on the losing side in World War II. Nobody would claim that post-1945, Italian governments have been models of good governance, and Italy is far poorer in natural resources than Russia. And yet, by the late 20th century, Italians were four or five times richer than Russians, purely because they had avoided communist rule. They were a lot freer, too.

 Sweet nothings

 The right comparison is not between China in 1949 and China now. It is between Chinas economic progress since 1949 and that achieved by its neighbours that were in a roughly similar state of development at that time. The two closest parallels are South Korea and Taiwan. Both had been Japanese colonies for decades, so they were a bit ahead of the mainland but then Taiwans population grew overnight by almost 40 per cent in 1949 as nationalist refugees from the lost civil war flooded in, and Korea was devastated by the war of 1950-53.

 Both Taiwan and South Korea were ruled for the next three decades by oppressive and ruthless military regimes. Neither country adopted raw free-market capitalism, but, at least, they were not tied to Marxist economics. By the Eighties, both countries had achieved economic takeoff, and democracy came soon afterwards.

 Meanwhile, China had the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution and various other man-made disasters, which meant that per capita income did not even double between 1949 and 1979. Then, under Deng Xiaoping, China finally abandoned socialist economics and adopted the same style of state-assisted capitalism that its neighbours had been practising for the past thirty years. Finally, its economy began to grow fast.

 Today the average Chinese income is about one-tenth of that in South Korea or Taiwan: slowly, they are starting to catch up. There is also more freedom in China now, though the state is still above the law. There is still no democracy, of course. The party constantly exhorts the people to be grateful for all that it has accomplished on their behalf, but they would probably have been much better off if it had never existed.

 Chavez must know all this, and presumably thinks that it just doesnt matter. His socialist project is fuelled by oil revenues, so he doesnt have to observe the rules of normal economics. But he does need allies against the wrath of the United States of America. So he says the right things to his hosts, the communist rulers of China. They may be closet capitalists these days, but if they dont have the myth that the revolution was beneficial, how can they justify their own monopoly of power?

 Well, they cant, actually.

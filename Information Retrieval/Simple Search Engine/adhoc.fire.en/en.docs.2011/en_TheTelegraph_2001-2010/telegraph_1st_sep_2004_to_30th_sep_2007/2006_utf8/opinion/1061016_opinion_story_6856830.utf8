 Letters to Editor

 Truth or dare

 Sir The Democratic Republic of Korea is a sovereign entity which is no longer a member of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and, therefore, has every right to test a nuclear device if it so wishes. No one has a right to tell it otherwise. The North Koreans are not stupid. They have seen the United States of America invade Iraq because the latter did not possess weapons of mass destruction which could have threatened the Americans. The Americans are also planning to invade Iran before it can acquire the means to adequately defend itself. The people of North Korea know how George Bush not merely reneged on Bill Clintons pledges to provide them with light water reactors, but also declared their country to be part of the axis of evil. It is more than obvious that North Koreas route to military security is the nuclear bomb. Economic security will not do, because the neo-con regime in the US needs endless wars to maintain its hold on the people, keep them cowed down, and distract attention from the lost wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. It is significant that the non-proliferator US makes no reference to the nuclear arsenal of its ally, Israel, or that the US and Israel are the only two nations to either use or threaten other nations with nuclear weapons.

 Under these circumstances, the North Korean nuclear tests are the correct response. Why is India deploring it?

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir With North Korea becoming the eighth country in history to join the nuclear weapons club, tension has gripped the affluent countries. The United Nations security council should take strong action against North Korea so that in future countries think twice before defying the NPT. The name of Pakistan having come up as an associate of North Korea, India should utilize this opportunity and try to get a better position for itself in the nuke deal. 

 Yours faithfully,

 Sir It is no surprise that the US and the worlds leading nuclear powers are getting furious over the recent nuclear testing by North Korea. The US always thinks that the mantle of the world is in its hands and all other countries must dance according to its tune. Its submissive allies like the United Kingdom, France, Australia, Japan and Germany help it in its misadventures such as the invasion of Iraq. What it told Pakistan through Richard Armitage (Be with us or get ready to go back to the Stone Age) is not specific only to Pakistan but is also a veiled threat to all other countries which oppose its policies and defy its orders. It is an open secret that the US has enough nuclear weapons to destroy the entire world. It does not have any problem if any of its allies conducts nuclear tests, or commits atrocities against weaker nations. A country like North Korea, which is surrounded by hostile neighbours such as Japan and South Korea, has every reason to take preventive measures to protect its sovereignty. North Korea has even declared that it will follow a no first use policy in case of nuclear warfare.

 Still, if the US is wary of North Koreas nuclear test, it is not because of its quest for a peaceful world but because it cannot digest the fact that its critics are getting stronger. If the US and its allies really wish to establish peace in the world, they first have to destroy their own pile of nuclear weapons and act as role models for others. 

 Yours faithfully,

Shobha Harikumar, Agartala

 Sir If North Korea has exploded its nuclear weapons, it is mainly because of the miscalculation and obstinate foreign policy of the US. But its plans to browbeat Pyongyang and suppress the communists have somehow misfired. An impoverished North Korea was looking for material help and recognition as a state from the US. It was even willing to stop its nuclear weapons programme. But the Americans would hear nothing of this. All they needed to do was offer some sops to the North Koreans. The US is now in a sticky situation, one that might well turn into another Iraq.

 Yours faithfully,

K. Venkataraman, Mumbai

 Sir North Korea has blasted its way into the nuclear club, leaving behind the detritus of the nuclear non-proliferation regime. It is a precarious situation: Japan and South Korea, faced with strategic compulsions, may follow suit, and Iran might find it opportune to progress from the peaceful use of nuclear energy to building nuclear weapons. The UN is in a diplomatic bind. If it imposes economic sanctions, they will mostly affect the already impoverished people of North Korea and, as the Iraq experience has shown, it is futile to hope for a regime change in the face of such punitive measures. The military option is out too, since there will never be evidence worthy of military action.

 So what does the international community do to prevent further nuclear testing? Sanctions have to be imposed as they project the strength and solidarity of the UN. But the most urgent course of action is to continue the dialogue. The USs policy of giving a cold shoulder to North Korea will only aggravate the situation. Most important, the loopholes in the NPT arrangement will have to be plugged as urgently as possible. As long as nuclear weapons exist and countries connect their power and security with their possession, the nuclear club will not be able to prevent gate-crashers. It would lack the moral ground to do so. 

 Yours faithfully,

Sangeeta Mahapatra, Calcutta

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Opinion

 DIARY

 Varun Gandhi ? or is it Feroze Gandhi? ? is feeling very unloved these days. He was just getting ready to make a grand entry into parliament via the by-elections to the ?safe? BJP seat of Vidisha, when, like a bolt from the blue, came the news that Arun Jaitley too was vying for it. Jaitley, it is learned, is keen to prove those wrong who say that he has no ?mass base?. The Vidisha seat would not only help him do that, but maybe also tailor his image to fit the space left by the demise of Pramod Mahajan. But where does this leave the young Gandhi in the BJP? In the lurch, obviously. So he ran to party chief Rajnath Singh and veteran LK Advani and complained that the party leadership was giving him ?unnecessary tension?, while whingeing about all the good things happening to his cousin from 10 Janpath. Jaitley, of course, is no stranger to such tricky situations. He is known to have called up Feroze Varun soon after and told him that with a surname like his, the young Gandhi should go for the Bhagalpur seat instead of opting for an unchallenging seat like Vidisha. Let?s watch if the ploy works.

 Here?s a classic case of charity beginning, and ending, miles away from home. The upper-caste messiah of the downtrodden castes, VP Singh, has quite obviously failed to pass on his ideals to his son. Ajey Singh, formerly with the World Bank, has now trained his eyes closer home. In fact, he has built a multi-storeyed shopping mall in the poshest locality of his home town, Allahabad. The first floor has already been bought for some fantastic sum by Macdonalds. But that?s understandable, since the construction of the mall is supposed to have cost a whopping ten crore. But now, the son of the crusader against the demolition of slums wants all the roadside shops and shanties around his best-loved mall to be removed. Why? Because they are spoiling the ambience of the area, and that will surely upset the rich and beautiful people who will soon be thronging the mall. No prizes for guessing that there is much pressure on the administration to hand the poor shopowners the relocation orders. It would be interesting to know what the senior Mr Singh has to say about all of this.

 Gratitude is not the strong area of the BJP?s VK Malhotra, who is now making noises about bringing a no-confidence motion against the Lok Sabha speaker, Somnath Chatterjee. Malhotra has an office-of-profit case pending against him in the Supreme Court. He needed to file an affidavit in reply to the notice served to him by the court. And guess who he turned to for help? Well, Somnath Chatterjee, of course.

 Whatever the BJPwallahs may be plotting against him, Somnath Chatterjee is busy pulling off some minor coups. First, he set the two television channels dedicated exclusively to the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha rolling. Second, and more important, he got the public sector companies to foot the Rs 35 crore-plus bill for the running of the two channels. However, he has a little problem on his hands: what to do about the unparliamentary exchanges between MPs reaching viewers via the live telecast of the proceedings? How to evolve a television equivalent of expunging obscenities and derogatory remarks? Now that calls for a think tank.

 Who says parliament has become a den of thieves and ?anti-social elements?? Not Lalit Suri. At least not any more. The other day, during the last session of parliament, the hotelier and socialite had gone home for lunch when he realized that he had left his mobile phone in the Central Hall. Imagine his surprise when he went back and found his phone...exactly where he had left it. Who would have thought that ?parliamentary decorum? still existed?

 A crisis in Jharkhand? Sumitra Mahajan, the BJP vice-president in charge of the state wouldn?t believe till the BJP CM, Babulal Marandi, actually resigned. Asked to go to Ranchi, she took a morning flight, met the press and was back in Delhi by the evening. And she didn?t seem to mind if people knew she was clueless that her party had appointed three observers to persuade Marandi.

 Interesting huddles at the second anniversary dinner thrown by the PM for the UPA coalition partners. Prakash and Brinda Karat were spotted sitting with Sonia Gandhi while CPI leaders like D. Raja were giving company to Manmohan Singh. Senior Congress leaders had a huddle of their own. The menu, like the coalition itself, had variety: there were Chinese, Kashmiri, Avadhi and south Indian dishes. The same set of people had met over another dinner, this time to discuss the women?s reservation bill impasse. Madam is known to have told Brinda Karat that if Lalu Prasad can be brought round, the bill would have a smooth passage. The Marxist lady lost no time in walking over to the RJD leader and brought him face to face with Sonia. Lalu Prasad, gallant as ever, quipped, ?Jab aap humko pakar kar le aaye hain to hum oppose nahin karenge (Since you have pulled me over here, I will not oppose the bill)?. Will he remain true to his word?

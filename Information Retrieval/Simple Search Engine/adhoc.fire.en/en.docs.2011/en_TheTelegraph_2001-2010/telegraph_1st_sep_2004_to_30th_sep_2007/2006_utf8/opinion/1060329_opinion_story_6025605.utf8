 TIGHT LIQUID

 L iquidity in the money market has been very tight ever since the India Millennium Deposits were repaid at the end of last year. Since then, it has not helped matters that there have been advance tax outflows this month and credit continues to grow at a scorching pace. Both these factors have added to the shortage of resources for banks. Also, since bankers have traditionally window-dressed their balance sheets at the end of the financial year, trying their level best to boost their deposits and advances to meet their targets, the squeeze on liquidity has increased. The upshot has been a sharp rise in short-term interest rates. And since there are political pressures not to increase lending rates, bankers have been clamouring for measures that will ease the liquidity situation, such as reducing the cash reserve ratio, which is the cash that they have to keep with the central bank. The finance minister has said that the Reserve Bank of India will address the liquidity issue, while the RBI has contended that the pressure on liquidity is temporary.

 It is easy to see why banks are desperate. The credit deposit ratio has gone up to 71.20 per cent, which means that for every Rs 100 worth of deposits that they have, they have lent Rs 71.20. But banks are also required to invest at least 25 per cent of their liabilities in government bonds, while the CRR pre-empts another 5 per cent of deposits. In sum, Rs 30 out of every Rs 100 worth of deposits are pre-empted, leaving only Rs 70 for lending. Yet, currently banks have lent Rs 71.20 out of every Rs 100, possibly by selling part of their accumulated stock of government securities to non-banks and insurance companies. What is more, the incremental credit-deposit ratio is much higher, at 108 per cent. Small wonder that there is a liquidity crunch. At the same time, there is little doubt that the main reason for the sudden drying up of liquidity lies in the IMD redemption ? banks? net foreign assets fell sharply last December. True, lending has increased rapidly but then lending is a source of funds, since every loan creates a deposit, albeit perhaps not in the same bank. The RBI is therefore right in considering the current liquidity crunch as a temporary one. In the longer term, liquidity will depend on the money brought in by foreign institutional investors and from external commercial borrowings and American Depository Receipts/convertible issues and whether the amounts are large enough to offset the rise in the current account deficit.
